    "this simplified model makes it possible to investigate the structure of outflows far from the magnetized rotator source without the need for self - similar assumptions .",
    "the price to pay for that is that the model does not give an exact , but only an approximate , solution because the transfield equation is not solved everywhere , but only at a few special places .",
    "how outflows behave in the asymptotic region constitutes the subject of the study of this paper which also focuses on the study of the asymptotic electric current and addresses the question of the asymptotic collimation of the different classes of rotators found in paper i. in this paper , we present a model where the collimated jet is assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with an external medium whose properties are independent of the distance to the source .",

    "a similar behavior has been discussed by appl & camenzind ( @xcite ) for relativistic jets , according to which the jet configurations had been referred to as diffuse and sharp pinch .",
    "important variations with respect to rotation can also be seen in the other physical quantities .",
    "in particular the poloidal velocity is highest in the envelope , though variations remain within a factor of two . in the very fast rotator limit",
    "the density falls off dramatically in the envelope where the gas pressure becomes negligible compared to the magnetic pressure .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] where the total pressure is represented with magnetic and gas pressures .",
    "_ for slow rotators , the gas pressure dominates everywhere in the outflow , while for fast rotators the magnetic pressure dominates in the envelope .",
    "_ in the latter case , most of the outer pressure at the outer edge is supported by magnetic field and not by gas pressure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the mass to magnetic flux ratio @xmath87 is represented as a function of the relative magnetic flux for various angular velocities .",
    "since the central part of the outflow is denser for fast rotators , the mass flux is very large in this region and very concentrated around the axis .",
    "it means that _ most of the matter is flowing along the polar axis for fast rotators_.      another potentially observable quantity is the mass loss rate particularly interesting since it can be evaluated from observations .",

    "the input values are @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . from this figure",
    "we can infer that _ the maximum momentum is situated in the axial part , especially for fast rotators_. therefore the central part of the jet will propagate more easily in the ambient medium than the external part .    when the mass loss rate grows , the outflow is slowed down on the edge and accelerated on the axis , while the poloidal magnetic field is also reduced . therefore _ the jets from the youngest stellar objects , which show the largest mass loss rates , should have a faster central core and a slower envelope than older ones_.    the profile of poloidal velocity depends sensitively on @xmath74 as well as the core radius that reduces as @xmath74 increases .",
    "as found in paper i for the inner conical region , it appears that an increase in mass loss rate has a similar effect to a decrease of the rotation rate .      in this subsection",
    "we study the dependence of the outflow properties on specific entropy @xmath93 on the stellar surface and polytropic index @xmath20 .",
    "the other parameters are given by @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "given @xmath73 and @xmath74 the poloidal velocity presents a minimum when the rotation parameter @xmath0 is almost equal to unity which corresponds to the intermediate class of rotators .",
    "slow rotators are then accelerated by an increase of the heating , but not fast rotators .",
    "it has also been found that a change in specific entropy does not affect the azimuthal to poloidal magnetic field ratio but just produces an increase of magnitudes .",
    "it has been found that the velocity can change by several orders of magnitude , between the adiabatic and isothermal flow , which are the narrower under the same conditions . in fig .",

    "the rotation parameter @xmath0 is plotted with respect to @xmath20 for various values of @xmath75 .",
    "two different classes of solutions can be distinguished , solutions for which @xmath0 start at small values for @xmath97 and then decrease and solutions which have large @xmath0 at @xmath98 and then increase .",
    "thus _ the value of the specific entropy discriminates between fast and slow rotators while larger @xmath20 s just tighten this distinction_.      we now apply the jet model to the ttauri star bp tau by using its properties , given by bertout et al.(1988 ) , which are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . on the base of these values we deduce ( see paper i ) the corresponding input parameters , which are , expressed in terms of the dimensionless reference values mentioned in section [ sect24 ] , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and a relative central density of @xmath108 .",

    "the axial region is the densest and slowest part of the asymptotic flow_. this dense core region is a fraction of the full jet with a minimum of @xmath110 for the fastest case .",
    "this corresponds to a central core of the order of @xmath111 . even if the fastest part is the outer one the maximum momentum",
    "is located around the polar axis .",
    "hence even if the relative velocity is smaller close to the axis the central region of the flow will propagate faster in the ambient medium . it also is found that , only in the central part of the asymptotic outflow , does the kinetic energy flux dominate over poynting flux .",
    "thus _ a large part of the magnetic energy has not been transferred to the kinetic energy in the case of constant rotation_.      the profiles of the differential angular velocities , that we use ( see paper i ) , are defined as follows : @xmath112 corresponds to a constant rotation rate across the flow , @xmath113 is a profile varying from @xmath112 to zero with a step - like transition , the same for @xmath114 but more smoothly , @xmath115 and @xmath116 vary from @xmath112 to @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively and finally @xmath119 follows the differential rotation of a solar - type star .",

    "a number of well - collimated outflows are observed to have larger poloidal velocities near the polar axis , and lower velocities at the edge of the flow .",
    "this motivated us to use a profile of type @xmath115 that could reproduce such behaviors .",
    "[ fig12 ] represents the total pressure for such differential rotators with respect to the relative radius for a set of central values of the angular velocity .",
    "similarly to rigid rotators , the pressure globally decreases from the axis to the outer edge , though the gradient of rotation causes a second peak of pressure to appear .",
    "the latter could correspond to a denser , slower and wider outflow surrounding the central fast jet .",
    "for slow and intermediate rotators , the inner pressure can be of order of the pressure at boundary of the outflow and the outer part can be as dense and slow as the axial region .",
    "a peak of poloidal velocity accompanies the pressure minimum which produces a double structure in such outflows , with a dense slow core surrounded by a faster component at half of the total radius itself embedded in a slower outer part .",
    "differential rotators can then produce jets with a narrow central part with large momentum surrounded by a larger outflow with smaller momentum , as are jet surrounded by a molecular flow .",
    "it is also found that some outflows like rigid rotators have smaller axial velocities than at the outer edge or present on the contrary a very fast component which corresponds to large gradients of the angular velocity .",
    "differential entropies can also cause such inverted asymptotic solutions though with less amplitude in the variation of the poloidal velocity .",
    "variations of the entropy profile bring an interesting feature .",
    "we have shown previously that magnetic pressure dominates at the outer edge for fast rotators while gas pressure dominates for slow rotators .",
    "in fact , variations of the specific entropy enhances this difference as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] where the pressures are plotted with respect to the relative radius .",
    "the total pressure does not change much as compared to the case of constant entropy while the gas to magnetic pressure ratio @xmath124 decreases .",
    "therefore @xmath124 can become quite low in some regions of the jet .",
    "this can have important consequences on the propagation of the jet and on the role of ambipolar diffusion ( frank et al .",

    "another interesting point is that the gas to magnetic pressure ratio starts to decrease very rapidly at a small value of the distance @xmath12 to the axis , so its derivative goes rapidly to zero across the jet as a function of radius .",
