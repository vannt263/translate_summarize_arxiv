    "baseball has a rich tradition of misjudged pop - ups .",
    "for example , in april , 1961 , roy sievers of the chicago white sox hit a towering pop - up above kansas city athletics third baseman andy carey who fell backward in trying to make the catch .",
    "the ball landed several feet from third base , far out of the reach of carey .",
    "it rolled into the outfield , and sievers wound up on second with a double .",
    "a few other well - known misplays of pop - ups include : new york giants first baseman fred merkle s failure to catch a foul pop - up in the final game of the 1912 world series , costing the giants the series against the boston red sox ; st .",
    "louis first baseman jack clark s botched foul pop - up in the sixth game of the 1985 world series against kansas city ; and white sox third baseman bill melton s broken nose suffered in an attempt to catch a `` routine '' pop - up in 1970 .",
    "as seen by these examples , even experienced major league baseball players can find it difficult to position themselves to catch pop - ups hit very high over the infield .",
    "players describe these batted balls as `` tricky '' or `` deceptive , '' and at times they will be seen lunging for the ball in the last instant of the ball s descent .",
    "`` pop - ups look easy to anyone who hasnt tried to catch one - like a routine fly ball that you do nt have to run for , '' clete boyer said , `` but they are difficult to judge and can really make you look like an idiot . ''",
    "boyer , a veteran of sixteen years in the major leagues , was considered one of the best defensive infielders in baseball .",
    "several factors can exacerbate the infielder s problem of positioning himself for a pop - up .",
    "wind currents high above the infield can change the trajectory of the pop - up radically .",
    "also , during day games the sky might provide little contrast as a background for the ball  a condition called a `` high sky '' by players . then , there are obstacles on the field  bases , the pitcher s mound , and teammates  that can hinder the infielder trying to make a catch .",
    "but even on a calm night with no obstacles nearby , players might stagger in their efforts to get to the ball .",
    "the frequency of pop - ups in the major leagues  an average of nearly five pop - ups per game  is great enough that teams provide considerable pop - up practice for infielders and catchers . yet",
    ", this practice appears to be severely limited in increasing the skill of these players .",
    "infielders seem unable to reach the level of competency in catching `` sky - high '' pop - ups that outfielders attain in catching high fly balls , for example .",
    "this suggests that the technique commonly used to catch pop - ups might be the factor limiting improvement .",
    "almost all baseball players learn to catch low , `` humpback '' pop - ups and fly balls before they have any experience in catching lofty pop - ups . in youth leagues",
    "nearly all pop - ups have low velocities and few exceed a height of fifty feet ; therefore , they have trajectories that are nearly parabolic .",
    "fly balls , too , have near - parabolic trajectories .",
    "young players develop techniques for tracking low pop - ups and fly balls .",
    "if 120-foot pop - ups do not follow similar trajectories , however , major league infielders might find pop - ups are hard to catch because the tracking and navigation method they have learned in their early years is unreliable for high , major league pop - ups .    in the consideration of this hypothesis",
    ", we first describe trajectories of a set of prototypical batted balls , using models of the bat - ball collision and ball flight aerodynamics .",
    "we then develop models of three specific kinds of typical non - parabolic pop - up trajectories .",
    "these `` paradoxical '' trajectories exhibit unexpected behavior around their apices , including cusps and loops .",
    "several of these paradoxical trajectories are fitted with an optical control model that has been used successfully to describe how players track and navigate to fly balls .",
    "for each fit , a prediction of the behavior of infielders attempting to position themselves to catch high pop - ups is compared with the observed behavior of players during games .",
    "as every student in an introductory physics course learns , the trajectory of a fly ball in a vacuum is a smooth symmetric parabola since the only force acting on it is the downward pull of gravity .",
    "however , in the atmosphere the ball is subject to additional forces , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : forces ] : the retarding force of drag ( @xmath0 ) and the magnus force ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the magnus force was first mentioned in the scientific literature by none other than a young isaac newton in his treatise on the theory of light,@xcite where he included a brief description on the curved trajectory of a spinning tennis ball . whereas the drag force always acts opposite to the instantaneous direction of motion ,",
    "the magnus force is normal to both the velocity and spin vectors . for a typical fly ball to the outfield",
    ", the drag force causes the trajectory to be somewhat asymmetric , with the falling angle steeper than the rising angle,@xcite although the trajectory is still smooth .",
    "if the ball has backspin , as expected for such fly balls , the magnus force is primarily in the upward direction , resulting in a higher  but still quite smooth  trajectory .",
    "however , as we will show the situation is qualitatively very different for a pop - up , since a ball - bat collision resulting in a pop - up will have a considerable backspin , resulting in a significantly larger magnus force than for a fly ball .",
    "moreover , the direction of the force is primarily horizontal with a sign that is opposite on the upward and downward paths .",
    "these conditions will result in unusual trajectories  sometimes with cusps , sometimes with loops  that we label as `` paradoxical . ''    with this brief introduction ,",
    "we next discuss our simulations of baseball trajectories in which a model for the ball - bat collision ( sec .",
    "[ sec : collision ] ) is combined with a model for the drag and magnus forces ( sec .",
    "[ sec : aero ] ) to produce the batted - ball trajectories .",
    "we discuss the paradoxical nature of these trajectories in sec  [ sec : trajs ] in light of the interplay among the various forces acting on the ball .",
    "the collision model is identical to that used both by sawicki@xcite and by cross and nathan.@xcite the geometry of the collision is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] . a standard baseball ( @xmath2=1.43 inch",
    ", mass=5.1 oz ) approaches the bat with an initial speed @xmath3=85 mph , initial backspin @xmath4=126 rad / s ( 1200 rpm ) , and at a downward angle of 8.6@xmath5 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the bat has an initial velocity @xmath6=55 mph at the point of impact and an initial upward angle of 8.6@xmath5 , identical to the downward angle of the ball .",
    "the bat was a 34-inch long , 32-oz wood bat with an r161 profile , with radius @xmath7=1.26 inch at the impact point .",
    "if lines passing through the center of the ball and bat are drawn parallel to the initial velocity vectors , then those lines are offset by the distance @xmath8 .",
    "simply stated , @xmath8 is the amount by which the bat undercuts ( @xmath9 ) or overcuts ( @xmath10 ) the ball . in the absence of initial spin on the baseball , a head - on collision ( @xmath11 )",
    "results in the ball leaving the bat at an upward angle of 8.6@xmath5 and with no spin ; undercutting the ball produces backspin and a larger upward angle ; overcutting the ball produces topspin and a smaller upward or even a downward angle .",
    "the ball - bat collision is characterized by two constants , the normal and tangential coefficients of restitution@xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively  with the additional assumption that angular momentum is conserved about the initial contact point between the ball and bat.@xcite for @xmath12 , we use the parameterization e_n = 0.54 - ( v_n-60)/895 , where @xmath14 is the normal component of the relative ball - bat velocity in units of mph.@xcite we further assume @xmath15 , which is equivalent to assuming that the tangential component of the relative ball - bat surface velocity , initially equal to @xmath16 , is identically zero as the ball leaves the bat , implying that the ball leaves the bat in a rolling motion . the loss of tangential velocity occurs as a result of sliding friction , and it was verified by direct calculation that the assumed coefficient of friction of 0.55@xcite is sufficient to bring the tangential motion to a halt prior to the end of the collision for all values of @xmath17 inches . given the initial velocities and our assumptions about @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the outgoing velocity @xmath18 , angle @xmath19 , and backspin of the baseball can be calculated as a function of the offset @xmath8 .",
    "these parameters , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] , along with the initial height of 3 ft .",
    ", serve as input into the calculation of the batted - ball trajectory .",
    "note particularly that both @xmath20 and @xmath19 are strong functions of @xmath8 , whereas @xmath18 only weakly depends on @xmath8 .",
    "the trajectory of the batted baseball is calculated by numerically solving the differential equations of motion using a fourth - order runge - kutta technique , given the initial conditions and the forces .",
    "conventionally , drag and magnus forces are written as & = & -c_dav^2 + & = & c_lav^2 ( ) , [ eq : drag ] where @xmath21 is the air density ( 0.077 lb / ft@xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the cross sectional area of the ball ( 6.45 inch@xmath24 ) , @xmath18 is the velocity , @xmath20 is the angular velocity , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are phenomenological drag and lift coefficients , respectively .",
    "note that the direction of the drag is opposite to the direction of motion whereas the direction of the magnus force is determined by a right - hand rule .",
    "we utilize the parametrizations of sawicki et al.@xcite in which @xmath27 is a function of the speed @xmath18 and @xmath26 is a bilinear function of spin parameter @xmath28 , implying that @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "since the velocity of the ball does not remain constant during the trajectory , it is necessary to recompute @xmath27 and @xmath26 at each point in the numerical integration .",
    "the resulting trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajs ] for values of @xmath8 in the range 0 - 1.7 inches , where an initial height of 3 ft was assumed .      the striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : trajs ] is the qualitatively different character of the trajectories as a function of @xmath8 , or equivalently as a function of the takeoff angle @xmath19 .",
    "these trajectories range from line drives at small @xmath19 , to fly balls at intermediate @xmath19 , to pop - ups at large @xmath19 . particularly noteworthy",
    "is the rich and complex behavior of the pop - ups , including cusps and loops .",
    "the goal of this section is to understand these trajectories in the context of the interplay among the forces acting on the ball . to our knowledge",
    ", there has been no previous discussion of such unusual trajectories in the literature .",
    "we focus on two particular characteristics that may have implications for the algorithm used by a fielder to catch the ball : the symmetry / asymmetry about the apex and the curvature . before proceeding , however , we remark that the general features of the trajectories shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajs ] are universal and do not depend on the particular model used for either the ball - bat collision or for the drag and lift .",
    "for example , using collision and aerodynamics models significantly different from those used here , adair finds similar trajectories with both cusp - like and loop - like behavior,@xcite which we verify with our own calculations using his model .",
    "models based on equations in watts and bahill@xcite result in similar trajectories .",
    "we first examine the symmetry , or lack thereof , of the trajectory about the apex . without the drag and magnus forces ,",
    "all trajectories would be symmetric parabolas ; the actual situation is more complicated . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajs ] , baseballs hit at low and intermediate @xmath19 ( line drives and fly balls ) have an asymmetric trajectory , with the ball covering less horizontal distance on the way down than it did on the way up .",
    "this feature is known intuitively to experienced outfielders . for larger @xmath19",
    "the asymmetry is smaller , and pop - ups hit at a very steep angle are nearly symmetric . how do the forces conspire to produce these results ?",
    "we address this question by referring to figs .",
    "[ fig : forcet1 ] and [ fig : forcet2 ] , in which the time dependence of the horizontal components of the velocity and the forces are plotted for a fly ball ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and a pop - up ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) . the initial decrease of the drag force for early times is due to the particular model used for the drag coefficient , which experiences a sharp drop near 75 mph .",
    "the asymmetry of the trajectory depends on the interplay between the horizontal components of drag and magnus , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . for forward - going trajectories ( @xmath36 )",
    ", @xmath34 always acts in the -x direction , whereas @xmath35 acts in the -x or + x direction on the rising or falling part of the trajectory , respectively .",
    "the relative magnitudes of @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend strongly on both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for fly balls , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are small enough ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] ) that the magnitude of @xmath34 is generally larger than the magnitude of @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcet1 ]",
    ". therefore @xmath37 is negative throughout the trajectory . under such conditions",
    ", there is a smooth continuous decrease in @xmath38 , leading to an asymmetric trajectory , since the horizontal distance covered prior to the apex is greater than that covered after the apex .",
    "the situation is qualitatively and quantitatively different for pop - ups , since both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are significantly larger than for a fly ball . as a result ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath35 is much greater than the magnitude of @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : forcet2 ] shows that @xmath39 , so that @xmath37 acts in the -x direction before the apex and in the + x direction after the apex . therefore , the loss of @xmath38 while rising is largely compensated by a gain in @xmath38 while falling , resulting in near symmetry about the apex .",
    "moreover , for this particular trajectory the impulse provided by @xmath37 while rising is nearly sufficient to bring @xmath38 to zero at the apex , resulting in the cusp - like behavior . for even larger values of @xmath19 , @xmath37 is so large that @xmath38 changes sign prior to the apex , then reverses sign again on the way down , resulting in the loop - the - loop pattern .",
    "we next address the curvature of the trajectory , @xmath40 , which is determined principally by the interplay between the magnus force @xmath1 and the component of gravity normal to the trajectory @xmath41 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath42 is directly proportional to the instantaneous value of @xmath43 and in particular that the sign of @xmath42 is identical to the sign of @xmath44 . in the absence of a magnus force , the curvature is always negative , even if drag is present .",
    "an excellent example is provided by the inverted parabolic trajectories expected in the absence of aerodynamic forces .",
    "the trajectories shown in fig .  [ fig : trajs ] fall into distinct categories , depending on the initial angle @xmath19 . for small enough @xmath19",
    ", @xmath42 is negative throughout the trajectory . indeed ,",
    "if c is initially negative , then it is always negative , since @xmath1 is never larger and @xmath45 is never smaller than it is at t=0 . for our particular collision and aerodynamic model ,",
    "the initial curvature is negative for @xmath19 less than about @xmath46 . for intermediate @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath42 is positive at the start and end of the trajectory but experiences two sign changes , one before and one after the apex .",
    "the separation between the two sign changes decreases as @xmath19 increases , until the two values coalesce at the apex , producing a cusp . for larger values of @xmath19",
    ", @xmath42 is positive throughout the trajectory , resulting in loop - like behavior such as the @xmath47 trajectory , where the sign of @xmath38 is initially positive , then changes to negative before the apex , and finally changes to back positive after the apex .",
    "all the simulations reported thus far assume that the spin remains constant throughout the trajectory .",
    "since the spin plays such a major role in determining the character of the trajectory , it is essential to examine the validity of that assumption . to our knowledge",
    ", there have been no experimental studies on the spin decay of baseballs , but there have been two such studies for golf , one by smits and smith@xcite and one by tavares et al.@xcite tavares et al .",
    "propose a theoretical model for the spin decay of a golf ball in which the torque responsible for the decay is expressed as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the radius of the ball and @xmath50 is the  coefficient of moment \" which is given by @xmath51 . by equating the torque to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the moment of inertia ,",
    "the spin decay constant @xmath54 can be expressed as = .",
    "[ eq : tau]using their measurements of @xmath54 , tavares et al .",
    "determine @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath56 sec for @xmath18=100 mph .",
    "the measurements of smits and smith can be similarly interpreted with @xmath57=0.009 , corresponding to @xmath58 sec at 100 mph . to estimate the spin decay constant for a baseball , we assume eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] applies , with @xmath59 scaled appropriately for a baseball and with all other factors the same .",
    "using @xmath59 = 2.31 and 2.49 oz / inch@xmath24 for a golf ball and baseball , respectively , the decay time for a baseball is about 8% longer than for a golf ball , or 22 - 27 sec at 100 mph and longer for smaller @xmath18 .",
    "a similar time constant for baseball was estimated by sawicki et al.,@xcite quite possibly using the same arguments as we use here .",
    "since the trajectories examined herein are in the air 7 sec or less , we conclude that our results are not affected by the spin decay .",
    "adair has suggested a much smaller decay time , of order 5 sec,@xcite which does not seem to be based on any experimental data .",
    "a direct check of our calculations shows that the qualitative effects depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajs ] persist even with a decay time as short as 5 sec .",
    "in a seminal article seville chapman@xcite proposed an optical control model for catching fly balls , today known as optical acceleration cancellation ( oac ) .",
    "chapman examined the geometry of catching from the perspective of a moving fielder observing an approaching ballistic target that is traveling along a parabola .",
    "he showed that in this case , the fielder can be guided to the destination simply by selecting a running path that keeps the image of the ball rising at a constant rate in a vertical image plane .",
    "mathematically , the tangent of the vertical optical angle to the ball increases at a constant rate .",
    "when balls are headed to the side , other optical control strategies become available.@xcite however , in the current paper we examine cases of balls hit directly toward the fielder , so we will emphasize predictions of the oac control mechanism .",
    "chapman assumed parabolic trajectories because of his ( incorrect ) belief that the drag and magnus forces have a negligible effect on the trajectory .",
    "of course we now know that the effects of these forces can be considerable , as discussed in sec .  [ sec : trajs ] . yet despite this initial oversight , numerous perception - action catching studies confirm that fielders actually do appear to utilize chapman s type of optical control mechanism to guide them to interception , and in particular oac is the only mechanism that has been supported for balls headed in the sagittal plane directly toward fielders.@xcite further support for oac has been found with dogs catching frisbees as well as functioning mobile robots.@xcite    extensive research on the navigational behavior of baseball players supports that perceptual judgment mechanisms used during fly ball catching can generally be divided into two phases.@xcite during the first phase , while the ball is still relatively distant , ball location information is largely limited to the optical trajectory ( i.e. the observed trajectory path of the image of the ball ) . during the second or final phase ,",
    "other cues such as the increase in optical size of the ball , and the stereo angle between the two eyes also become available and provide additional information for final corrections in fielder positioning and timing .",
    "the control parameters in models like oac are optical angles from the fielder s perspective , which help direct fielder position relative to the ongoing ball position .",
    "considerable work exploring and examining the final phase of catching has been done by perception scientists@xcite and some recent speculation has been done by physicists.@xcite researchers generally agree that the majority of fielder movement while catching balls takes place during the first phase in which fielders approach the destination region where the ball is headed . in the current work ,",
    "we focus on control models like oac that guide fielder position during the initial phase of catching .",
    "thus for example , we would consider the famous play in which jose canseco allowed a ball to bounce off of his head for a home run to be a catch , in that he was guided to the correct location to intercept the ball .",
    "an example of how a fielder utilizes the oac control strategy to intercept a routine fly ball to the outfield is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : oac ] .",
    "this figure illustrates the side view of a moving fielder using oac control strategy to intercept two realistic outfield trajectories determined by our aerodynamics model described in sec .",
    "[ sec : trajs ] . as specified by oac , the fielder simply runs up or back as needed to keep the tangent of the vertical optical angle to the ball increasing at a constant rate .",
    "since the trajectory deviates from a parabola , the fielder compensates by altering running speed somewhat .",
    "geometrically the oac solution can be described as the fielder keeping the image of the ball rising at a constant rate along a vertical projection plane that moves forward or backwards to remain equidistant to the fielder . for fly balls of this length ,",
    "the geometric solution is roughly equivalent to the fielder moving in space to keep the image of the ball aligned with an imaginary elevator that starts at home plate and is tilted forward or backward by the amount corresponding to the distance that the fielder runs . as can be seen in the figure , these outfield trajectories are notably asymmetric , principally due to air resistance shortening , yet oac still guides the fielder along a smooth , monotonic running path to the desired destination .",
    "this simple , relatively direct navigational behavior has been observed in virtually all previous perception - action catching studies with humans and animals.@xcite      most previous models of interceptive perception - action assume that real - world fly ball trajectories remain similar enough to parabolic for robust optical control strategies like oac to generally produce simple , monotonic running path solutions .",
    "supporting tests have confirmed simple behavior consistent with oac in relatively extreme interception conditions including catching curving frisbees , towering outfield blasts and short infield pop - ups.@xcite the apparent robustness of these optical control mechanisms implies the commonly observed vacillating and lurching of fielders pursuing high pop - ups must be due to some inexplicable cause .",
    "it appears that the infielder is an unfortunate victim of odd wind conditions , if not perhaps a bit too much chew tobacco or a nip of something the inning before . in the current work ,",
    "we have provided evidence that there is a class of high infield pop - ups that we refer to as paradoxical .",
    "next we show that these deviate from normal parabolic shape in ways dramatic enough to lead fielders using oac to systematically head off in the wrong direction or bob forward and back .",
    "below we illustrate how a fielder guided by oac will behave with each of the three paradoxical pop fly trajectories that we determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] of this paper .",
    "we first examine perhaps the most extreme paradoxical trajectory of the group , the case of @xmath47 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pop17 ] .",
    "this trajectory actually does a full loop - the - loop between the catcher and pitcher , finally curving back out on its descent and landing about 30 feet from home plate .",
    "given the extreme directional changes of this trajectory , we might expect an infielder beginning 100 feet from home plate to experience difficulty achieving graceful interception . yet , as can be seen in the figure , this case actually results in a relatively smooth running path solution .",
    "when the fielder maintains oac throughout his approach , he initially runs quickly forward , then slightly overshoots the destination , and finally lurches back . in practice , near the interception point , the fielder is so close to the approaching ball that it seems likely the eventual availability of other depth cues like stereo disparity and rate of change in optical size of the ball will mitigate any final lurch , and result in a fairly smooth overall running path to the destination .",
    "second we examine the case of a pop fly resulting from a bat - ball offset @xmath32 in fig .  [ fig : pop16 ] . here",
    "the horizontal velocity decreases in the beginning and approaches zero velocity near the apex .",
    "then after the apex , the magnus force increases the horizontal velocity . yet , of greater impact to the fielder is that this trajectory s destination is near where the fielder begins .",
    "thus from the fielder s perspective , before the discontinuity takes place the trajectory slows in the depth direction such as to guide the fielder to run up too far and then later to reverse course and backtrack to where the ball is now accelerating forward . here",
    "the normally reliable oac strategy leads the fielder to systematically run up too far and in the final second lurch backwards .",
    "third , we examine the case of a pop fly that lands just beyond the fielder , the @xmath60 condition , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pop15 ] . in this case",
    "oac leads the fielder to initially head back to very near where the ball is headed , but then soon after change direction and run forward , only to have to run back again at the end . certainly , when a fielder vacillates or  dances around \" this much , it does not appear that he is being guided well to the ball destination . yet , this seemingly misguided movement is precisely specified by the oac control mechanism .",
    "thus , the assumption that fielders use oac leads to the bold prediction that even experienced , professional infielders are likely to vacillate and make a final lurch backward when navigating to catch some high , hard - hit pop - ups , and indeed this is a commonly witnessed phenomenon .",
    "former major league infielders have affirmed to us that pop - ups landing at the edge of the outfield grass ( 100 to 130 ft . from home plate ) usually are the most difficult to catch .",
    "it is notable that in each of the cases depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : pop17]-[fig : pop15 ] , the final movement by the fielder prior to catching the ball is backwards . this feature can be directly attributed to the curvature of the trajectory , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : trajs ] . for a typical fly ball ,",
    "the curvature is small and negative , so the ball breaks slightly towards home plate as it nears the end of its trajectory . for pop - ups ,",
    "the curvature is large and positive , so the ball breaks away from home plate , forcing the fielder to move backward just prior to catching the ball .",
    "why are very high pop - ups so hard to catch ? using models of the bat - ball collision and ball flight aerodynamics , we have shown that the trajectories of these pop - ups have unexpected features , such as loops and cusps .",
    "we then examined the running paths that occur with these dramatically non - parabolic trajectories when a fielder utilizes oac , a control strategy that has been shown effective for tracking near - parabolic trajectories .",
    "the predicted behavior is very similar to observed behavior of infielders attempting to catch high pop - ups .",
    "they often vacillate forward and backward in trying to position themselves properly to make the catch , and frequently these changes in direction can lead to confusion and positioning error .",
    "former major league infielders confirm that our model agrees with their experiences .",

    "<S> some of the dancing around when infielders pursue pop - ups can be well explained as a combination of bizarre trajectories and misguidance by the normally reliable optical control strategy , rather than apparent fielder error . </S>",
