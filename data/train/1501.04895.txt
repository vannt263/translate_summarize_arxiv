    "yang @xcite proposed the first quantum analogue of mceliece pke , in which the public - key and private - key are classical , however it can encrypt quantum messages . later in 2010 , we extend it and present the definition of induced trapdoor one - way transformation ( owt ) , then construct a framework of quantum pke based on the induced trapdoor owt .",

    "the cipher @xmath93 and plaintext @xmath24 satisfy the relation @xmath94 , where @xmath45 is a binary row vector of weight @xmath95 .",

    "if each column @xmath99 of @xmath96 has more zeros ( it means the hamming weight of @xmath99 is small enough ) , @xmath102 would equal to @xmath103 with large probability , then its @xmath104th bit @xmath105 would reveal the @xmath104th bit of original plaintext with large probability .",

    "@xmath111 is a @xmath30 matrix , and @xmath112 are two @xmath113 vectors , but @xmath108 is unknown .",

    "this is just a closest vector problem ( cvp ) , which is a np - hard problem .",
    "we have tried numerical experiment following the above attack , and it seems that this kind of attack is invalid .",
    "this attack is reduced to an optimal problem ( cvp ) : finding @xmath108 , such as @xmath110 ( notice that it equals @xmath99 ) has weight smaller than a given value .",
    "suppose the parameters @xmath114 in the mceliece pkc scheme .",
    "firstly , because @xmath108 has @xmath115 choices , both the exhaustive search and random search are not realistic . while choosing some small parameters such as @xmath116 , the exhaustive search can reduce the weight of @xmath99 to @xmath117 with probability @xmath118 , and the random search may be slightly better . with the greedy search ,",
    "we obtain @xmath99 of weight @xmath119 on average . in this case ,",
    "@xmath120\\approx 0.5 + 0.1\\times 10^{-13}$ ] , here @xmath45 is a @xmath7-bit random vector of weight @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the attack presented here is invalid .    * _ secondly , we strictly prove the relationship between the security of quantum pke protocols and that of its classical counterpart .",
    "_    * theorem 1 : * the quantum mceliece pke is at least as secure as classical mceliece pke protocol .",
    "* proof : * suppose there is a quantum algorithm @xmath122 , which can efficiently transform the cipher state @xmath70 into quantum message @xmath65 . in order to decrypt arbitrary classical cipher @xmath123 , we firstly prepare a quantum state @xmath124 .",
    "then , the quantum state @xmath124 is an input to the quantum algorithm @xmath122 , and will be transformed into the quantum state @xmath125 .",
    "finally , the classical message @xmath126 is obtained via measuring the output quantum state @xmath125 .",
    "thus , if there is an attack to quantum mceliece pke , there would be an attack to classical mceliece pke .",
    "therefore , quantum mceliece pke is at least as secure as classical mceliece pke protocol.@xmath127    since the functions @xmath128 and @xmath78 are classical functions , finding the trapdoor @xmath129 is a classical computational problem .",
    "thus , the security of qpke protocol based on induced trapdoor owt depends on the onewayness of corresponding classical trapdoor one - way function .",
    "now we can arrive at the following conclusion .",
    "_ the security of a qpke protocol based on induced trapdoor owqt is one between that of corresponding classical pke and the onewayness of related classical one - way function . in other words ,",
    "the security of a qpke given above is not stronger than the onewayness of related classical trapdoor one - way function , and is not weaker than the security of its classical counterparts . _",
    "* _ finally , we analyze its security from the aspect of attack .",
    "_    the attacker can have two different strategies : 1 ) attacking the secret key from the public key ; 2 ) attacking the ciphertext @xmath70 .",
    "if the attacker adopts the first strategy , the difficulty is the same as that of attacking the classical mceliece pke , because the quantum pke scheme uses the same key - generating algorithm as its classical counterpart .",
    "if the attacker adopts the second strategy , we should analyze what can be extracted from the ciphertext @xmath70 .",
    "* theorem 2 : * the strategy 2 ) is inefficient when attacking the ciphertext of quantum mceliece pke scheme .",
    "* proof : * because @xmath21 matrix @xmath47 is public and full rank @xmath48 ( @xmath32 ) , the attacker can compute its generalized inverse matrix @xmath67 , which is a @xmath91 matrix . thus , the attacker can perform the following processing on the ciphertext .",
    "@xmath130 then , the attacker can measurement the first register , and obtain the value of @xmath131 .",
    "in addition , he can also obtain a new ciphertext @xmath132 , which can be written as @xmath133 or @xmath134 . from the following two propositions",
    ", the proof can be finished .",
    "* proposition 1 : * given the values of @xmath131 and @xmath135 , solving the value of @xmath45 is a lpn problem .",
    "* proof : * now we know the attacker can obtain the values of @xmath131 and @xmath135 . because @xmath136 and @xmath137 , it can be inferred that @xmath30 matrix @xmath135 is not full rank .",
    "so only a little information about @xmath45 can not be computed from the values of @xmath131 and @xmath135 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath138 is still hard to compute .",
    "denote @xmath139 .",
    "then , computing the value of @xmath138 is a npc problem : given the values of @xmath140,@xmath47 , @xmath45 is a random binary vector , how to compute the value of @xmath138 from the equation @xmath141 ?",
    "it is just a lpn problem which has been discussed above .",
    "@xmath127    now we know the attacker can transform the ciphertext @xmath70 into @xmath134 .",
    "however , it does not hold for any quantum state @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , the transformation @xmath142 may be physically infeasible .",
    "the proof is given in the appendix .",
    "* proposition 2 : * the state @xmath133 is unrelated with the plaintext @xmath65 , from the view of fidelity .",
    "* proof : * according to fujita s analysis @xcite , @xmath143 basis measurement on the two states @xmath144 and @xmath145 can result a same statistical probability .",
    "this is obviously correct since the two states differ only in some bit - flips @xcite .",
    "so it is expected that the attacker may obtain some information about the quantum messages by quantum measurement on @xmath144 .",
    "though there exists a vulnerability in quantum mceliece pke , it should be stressed that similarity of these two states @xmath133 and @xmath65 is described by the fidelity of them : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a random string depending on the error @xmath45 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath148 may equals to any value from 0 to 1 , then , generally speaking , identical probability distributions do not means identical states.@xmath127    _ remark 2 : _ the attack to the state @xmath133 can also be analyzed from information theory .",
    "according to holevo theorem @xcite , the quantum measurement on @xmath149 can obtain at most @xmath48-bit information , but @xmath65 has @xmath150 amplitudes @xmath151 .",
    "suppose each amplitude is accurate to @xmath152 decimal places , then each @xmath151 can be seen as @xmath152-bit complex number which has both real and image parts , so it is necessary to obtain @xmath153-bit information for determining an unknown state @xmath65 .",
    "it can be seen that even alice encrypts the same quantum state polynomial times , the attacker can obtain at most a polynomial - bits information .",
    "it is still hard for her to determine the state @xmath65 .",
    "as stated by fujita @xcite , the vulnerability of quantum mceliece pke is due to the fact that our pkc introduces no phase encryption . in this section ,",
    "we propose an improved variant of the quantum mceliece pke scheme using double - encryption technique .",
    "the encryption is briefly stated as follows .",
    "the quantum mceliece pke is used twice , however , the second encryption uses the different parameters from the first .    1 .",
    "alice uses two pairs of public - keys @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "she firstly uses the first public - key @xmath154 to encrypt the @xmath48-qubit message @xmath65 , and obtain a @xmath7-qubit state @xmath156 .",
    "then she performs an hadamard transformation @xmath157 on this state and obtain @xmath158 .",
    "finally she uses the second public - key @xmath155 to encrypt the @xmath7-qubit quantum state @xmath159 , and obtains a @xmath160-qubit quantum state , which is the ciphertext of the improved scheme .",
    "the final ciphertext is as follow : @xmath161|kg_2'\\oplus r_2\\rangle .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    bob receives the ciphertext , and performs the following decryption process .    1 .",
    "bob uses the second private - key to decrypt the received @xmath160-qubit quantum cipher state , and obtain a @xmath7-qubit state @xmath162 .",
    "then he performs an hadamard transformation @xmath157 on the @xmath7-qubit state .",
    "finally he uses the first private - key to decrypt and obtain the @xmath48-qubit message .",
    "firstly , it should be noticed that , our scheme is more simple than the scheme proposed by fujita @xcite .",
    "fujita s scheme is constructed based on quantum error - correction code , which has the ability to correct quantum errors",
    ". however , the encoding in our scheme uses classical error - correction code and can not correct quantum errors , and has less redundance , so its encoding circuit needs less ancillary qubits and is more simple than fujita s scheme",
    ".    now , let s consider the security of double - encryption scheme .",
    "from the view of alice , the attacker can obtain the following quantum state by performing a unitary about @xmath163 , @xmath164|k\\rangle.\\ ] ] then he performs @xmath157 and obtains the following state @xmath165|k\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & z(r_2g_2'^-)h^{\\otimes n}\\sum_k\\left[\\sum_m\\alpha_m(-1)^{k\\cdot(mg_1'\\oplus r_1)}\\right]|k\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & z(r_2g_2'^-)\\sum_m\\alpha_m|mg_1'\\oplus r_1\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_m\\alpha_m(-1)^{(r_2g_2'^-)\\cdot(mg_1'\\oplus r_1)}|mg_1'\\oplus r_1\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then perform a transformation with relative to @xmath166 , and finally obtains a state @xmath167 during the above process , the attacker can obtain the values of @xmath168,@xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . however , he still can not obtain the values of @xmath172 .",
    "the reason is the same as the analysis in section [ sec22 ] .",
    "then , whether one can extract some information about the plaintext @xmath65 from the state in eq.([equ6 ] ) ?    in the original quantum mceliece pke scheme , the attacker can transform the ciphertext and obtain the state @xmath133 . by comparing this state with the original quantum message @xmath65",
    ", they differs only some bit - flip errors .",
    "thus , the original encryption scheme introduces only bit - flip errors , however , bit - flip errors can be seen as phase errors in conjugate space because of @xmath173 .",

    "both bit - flip errors and phase errors are introduced .",
    "thus , whether it is seen from the conjugate space or not , the two types of errors exist simultaneously . then the vulnerability is eliminated .",
    "the detail arguments are as follows .",
    "* theorem 3 : * the double - encryption scheme is more secure than the original quantum pke scheme in sec.[seccount2 ] .    * proof : * because the attacker can transfer the quantum cipher into the state @xmath174 in eq.([equ6 ] ) , with regard to the attacker , the encryption operator can be written as @xmath175 where the operator @xmath176 is independent of the two error vectors @xmath172 .",
    "given the public key @xmath177 , the operator @xmath178 is a constant operator .",
    "_ remark 3 : _ as is known from refs.@xcite , the encryption operator in private quantum channel can be written as @xmath179 , where @xmath180 are chosen randomly , and its security depends on the randomness of @xmath180 . because @xmath178 in eq.([equ9 ] ) is a constant operator , the encryption operator @xmath181 can be seen as a special kind of private quantum channel , where the difference lies in that the weight of random vectors @xmath172 is bounded by @xmath182 separately .    in the original quantum mceliece pke scheme ,",
    "the encryption operator can be seen as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 .",
    "the random bits of @xmath172 in the double - encryption scheme is twice more than that in the original quantum mceliece pke scheme . in other words , attacking the state @xmath185 is more difficult than attacking the state @xmath186 .",
    "thus , the double - encryption scheme can improve the security of our quantum pke scheme.@xmath127    from the above proof , one can informally conclude that    _ to achieve the same security as the original quantum mceliece pke scheme in sec.[seccount2 ] , the double - encryption scheme requires about half of the key - length than the original scheme . _",

    "so , the ratio between the bit - length of the random key and the length of ciphertext would decrease approaching zero when the double - encryption scheme are used several times . that is , with respect to the length of ciphertext , the amount of key is reduced , then it means the security will be worse .",

    "it is worth to notice that some of the schemes in ref.@xcite do not have post - quantum security .",
    "the other quantum mceliece pke proposed by fujita @xcite is based on quantum coding .",
    "the security of both fujita s and our schemes depends on the difficulty of solving npc problem .",
    "fujita @xcite pointed out a vulnerability of our scheme in ref.@xcite , however , it has been improved in this paper .",
    "ref.@xcite argued that the pke scheme in ref.@xcite is insecure while encrypting classical messages .",
    "here we have clarified it in sec.[sec22 ] .",
    "in addition , we would like to mention that it is sufficient to adopt the original pke scheme proposed in ref.@xcite in some low - level security scenario besides encrypting classical messages . finally , we would argue that , our scheme is more simple than fujita s scheme .",
    "the reason is as follows : fujita s scheme is based on quantum error correction code and the encoding can correct quantum errors , while our scheme is based on classical error correction code and does not have the ability of quantum error correction ; this means correcting quantum error is not the necessary functionality in quantum public - key cryptosystems ; our scheme removes this redundant functionality , and makes the encoding / decoding more simple .",
    "quantum version of mceliece pke is analyzed and is at least as secure as their classical counterparts , and , at the same time , are also shown that they can not be more secure than related one - way function .",
    "we also suggest double - encryption scheme to improve the security of the qpke protocol , and analyze its security would decrease while multiply applying the double - encryption scheme .",

    "this algorithm can be modified to be a quantum encoding alogrithm which implements the transformation @xmath195 the number of qubits changes after the above transformation .",
    "it is worth to explain why this quantum transformation is valid . because the encoding algorithm @xmath196 is a reversible computing , and both the two - way computing can be implemented efficiently , the following two steps of quantum computing",
    "can also be implemented efficiently : @xmath197 thus , the quantum encoding alogrithm can be written as the eq.([equ5 ] ) . however",
