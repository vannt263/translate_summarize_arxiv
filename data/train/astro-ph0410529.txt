    "the common age , metallicity and distance of their members make galactic open star clusters favourable environments in which to examine fundamental issues in stellar and galactic astrophysics e.g. the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) or the form of the initial mass - final mass relationship ( e.g. weidemann 1987 )",
    ". the modestly rich and well studied praesepe ( ngc2632 ) cluster at a distance of 177pc , as determined from hipparcos astrometric measurements ( mermilliod et al .",
    "1997 ) , appears particularly suited to such investigations .",
    "its members share a distinct proper motion so it is comparatively straightforward to discriminate them from the vast majority of field objects along this line of sight .",
    "for example , hambly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) performed an astrometric survey of 19 sq .",
    "degrees centered on the cluster and found the proper motions of members tightly clumped around @xmath14 mas yr@xmath15 and @xmath16mas yr@xmath15 .",
    "a more recent hipparcos based study of praesepe finds mean values of @xmath17 mas yr@xmath15 and @xmath18mas yr@xmath15 ( van leeuwen 1999 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]      a steep powerlaw ( @xmath19 ) was the only shape of imf of the four investigated by w04 consistent with his assumption of seven white dwarf members of praesepe , for reasonable values of the maximum progenitor mass ( 6m@xmath20 m@xmath21m@xmath5 ) .",
    "the `` naylor '' imf , a broken powerlaw with index @xmath22 ( m@xmath23m@xmath5 ) and @xmath24 ( m@xmath25m@xmath5 ) was found to be consistent only for m@xmath26m@xmath5 .",
    "however , in a subsequent paper , williams , bolte & liebert ( 2004 ) , show lb6037 and lb6072 to be qsos , reducing the number of bona fide white dwarf members of praesepe unearthed to date to only five . in this case , only the steep powerlaw form with m@xmath27m@xmath5 can be considered consistent with the observations .    nevertheless",
    ", we have presented evidence here the number of praesepe white dwarfs is at least seven . as a further check of the membership status of our two new spectroscopic candidates",
    "we constrain their distances using the measured t@xmath28s and log g s and radii derived from evolutionary tracks . from the `` thick h layer '' models of wood ( 1995 ) we determine r@xmath29r@xmath5 and r@xmath30r @xmath5 for lb5959 and wd0837 + 218 respectively .",
    "subsequently , we estimate the absolute visual magnitude of lb5959 to be m@xmath31 and that of wd0837 + 218 to be m@xmath32 . refering to the synthetic photometry of bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ; private comm . ) , we estimate b - v @xmath33 and + 0.05 for the cooler and hotter degenerate respectively . thus from the supercosmos data , b@xmath34 and b@xmath35 , we determine v magnitudes of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "hence , we estimate these white dwarfs to reside at @xmath38pc and @xmath39pc respectively .",
    "indeed , the favourable success rate of our preliminary survey in unearthing cluster white dwarfs suggests several of the remaining four new candidates will also prove to be degenerate members .",
    "however , as confirmation of this must await further spectroscopy , for now we consider the observed number of praesepe white dwarfs , n , to lie in the range @xmath40 n @xmath41 . based on the williams simulations we find the steep powerlaw form of the imf is consistent with the observed number for any reasonable value of m@xmath11 . similarly , if n@xmath42 the `` naylor '' form can be considered consistent for any reasonable value of m@xmath11 .",
    "we note , one requires to detect at least ten white dwarf members for the salpeter form of the imf to be regarded at best , in williams scheme , as mildly inconsistent with the observed number ( p@xmath43 ) .",
    "as our preliminary results indicate white dwarf members are to be found beyond the well studied inner regions of the cluster ( figure 1 shows wd0837 + 218 lies at a projected separation of @xmath44 ) more likely await discovery .",
    "a detailed survey extending out to at least the tidal radius should be undertaken before any firm conclusions are drawn regarding the form of the imf .",
    "prior to this work only the `` naylor '' form of the imf was found to be consistent with the non - detection of cluster white dwarfs residing in unresolved binary systems ( w04 ) . however , there is no evidence to suggest that either of the two new confirmed white dwarfs resides in a binary .",
    "we find a white dwarf with t@xmath45k and log g @xmath46 , typical of the praesepe population , has m@xmath47=11.0 , m@xmath48=11.0 and m@xmath49=10.2 ( bergeron et al . 1995 ) and a young disc m3 dwarf has m@xmath47=10.7 , m@xmath48=12.3 and m@xmath49=13.4 ( leggett et al .",
    "an unresolved binary consisting of these two objects has u - b@xmath50 , b - v@xmath51 .",
    "it thus lies on the fringes of the w04 criteria for being `` observable '' ( u - b @xmath52 , b - v @xmath53 ) , which were chosen to approximate the limits of the ubv surveys of c01 and anthony - twarog .",
    "white dwarfs with more massive main sequence companions are unlikely to have been identified by these surveys .",
    "similarly , since both luyten s and the current work utilised blue and red photographic plates , selecting objects with colours i.c.@xmath54 ( @xmath55 b - v@xmath56 ) and o - e@xmath57 respectively , these too are likely biased against finding white dwarfs residing in binaries with stars of spectral type earlier than mid - m .",
    "farihi et al ( 2003 ) report a deficit of objects of spectral type later than mid - m paired to field white dwarfs at separations of @xmath58 few 100au .",
    "further , radial velocity surveys point towards a drop in the relative frequency of main sequence binaries with mass ratios m@xmath59m@xmath60 , at separations @xmath61 au ( halbwachs et al . 2003 ; marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "hence , it seems plausible , particularly as the progenitors of the praesepe and hyades white dwarfs had m@xmath62m@xmath5 , that by including a population of zero age binaries consisting of randomly paired stars , the simulations of w04 overpredict the number of detectable white dwarfs in unresolved binaries with main sequence companions .",
    "this assumption was acknowledged by w04 as a possible shortcoming in their modelling .",
    "our forthcoming galex survey of praesepe will expand the parameter space in which we are able to search for white dwarfs to include those in unresolved systems with k , g , and f type companions .",
    "it will reveal important additional information on the form of the imf and the binary fraction of this cluster .",
    "we have estimated the masses of the two new white dwarfs by comparing their measured t@xmath28s and log g s to the predictions of evolutionary calculations ( wood 1995 ) . as expected for their progenitor masses , m @xmath62 m , these two objects have masses greater than the canonical white dwarf value of m @xmath63m@xmath5 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we have also used the evolutionary tracks to estimate the cooling times of these objects , determining @xmath8myrs and @xmath6myrs for lb5959 and wd0837 + 218 respectively .",
    "as the age of the cluster is rather uncertain we have used three different estimates encompassing the likely value ( log @xmath64 ) to derive the progenitor lifetimes . using cubic splines to interpolate between the lifetimes calculated for stars of solar composition by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we constrain the masses of the progenitors of lb5959 and wd0837 + 218 to be @xmath9 m @xmath10 m@xmath11 m@xmath5 and @xmath12 m @xmath13 m@xmath5 respectively .    examining the location of these objects in figure 11 of c01 we find while lb5959 fits in comfortably with a monotonic relationship between initial mass and final - mass , like lb5893 , wd0837 + 218 appears to be too hot and hence too young for its high mass .",
    "we note there are five blue straggler members of praesepe ( e.g. andrievsky 1998 ) .",
    "the evolution of these objects appears to have been delayed , either through binary interaction or another as yet unidentified mechanism .",
    "we suggest that lb5893 and wd0837 + 218 may be related to this population .",
    "alternatively , as suggested by reid ( 1996 ) , perhaps , at least some stars , do not subscribe to a simple monotonic relationship between their mass and the mass of their resulting white dwarf remnant .",

    "rn and mbu acknowledge the support of pparc advanced fellowships . the wht is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
