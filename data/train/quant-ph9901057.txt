    "we observe a series of dispersion shaped resonances centered on every mechanical resonance @xmath153 , with an important noise reduction for frequencies slightly below each resonance .",
    "thermal noise however masks this behavior since the brownian motion is concentrated around the mechanical resonances and increases the noise ( curve a ) .    to summarize this discussion",
    ", it appears that the most interesting frequency domain for quantum noise reduction is the low frequency domain ( @xmath187 ) .  for sufficiently low temperature",
    "the noise behavior is similar to the one obtained with a pure kerr effect and it mainly depends on the non - linear phase shift @xmath114 .",
    "more precisely the frequency dependence of the noise spectrum roughly corresponds to a low - pass filtering due to the cavity bandwidth and the amplitude of noise reduction becomes important near the bistability turning points@xcite .  to reach these points the non - linear phase shift @xmath114 must be large enough , that is of the order of @xmath105 .",
    "the non - linear phase shift depends on the mechanical and optical properties of the system .",
    "in particular it is related to the spatial overlap between the various acoustic modes and the light ( eq .  [ eq_chieff0 ] ) .",

    "one observes a drastic increase of the noise reduction when @xmath40 decreases .",
    "this result can be interpreted as a reduction of the effective mass associated with the optomechanical coupling .",
    "quantum effects observed in figures [ fig_skerr ] and [ fig_sw0 ] in the low frequency domain are actually similar to the ones obtained with a harmonically suspended mirror.the effective susceptibility of the resonator is thus equivalent at low frequency to the susceptibility of a single harmonic oscillator with a resonance frequency @xmath11 .",

    "this effective mass @xmath200 can be deduced from a comparison between the effective susceptibility @xmath201 $ ] at zero frequency and the one of a harmonic oscillator ( eqs .",

    "the number of transverse modes which contribute to the effective mass is proportional to @xmath206 and it increases when @xmath40 decreases . as a consequence the mass becomes smaller and quantum effects of radiation pressure become larger .    from equations ( [ eq_onp ] ) to ( [ eq_overlap ] )",
    "one can express the effective mass as a function of the waists @xmath165 , @xmath40 and of the mass @xmath207 of the fundamental mode @xmath208 solid line in figure [ fig_mass ] shows the variation of the effective mass as a function of the ratio @xmath209 for a resonator of thickness @xmath210 mm and of curvature radius @xmath211 mm .",
    "it clearly appears that this mass decreases with the optical waist and very small values can be reached .",
    "the mass @xmath212 of the fundamental mode is equal to 37 mg ( eq .   [ eq_mnp ] ) and one gets an effective mass of 1 mg for an optical waist equal to @xmath213 ( 380 @xmath62 m ) and a mass of 0.2 mg for a waist of 100 @xmath214 m .",
    "such small values would be very difficult to obtain with a harmonically suspended mirror for which the mass associated with the global motion is the total mass of the mirror .",
    "one can get a simple physical insight into the effective mass in the case of a resonator thickness much smaller than the curvature radius of the convex side ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "we can then assume that the transverse modes of the resonator are degenerate , that is the resonance frequencies @xmath153 are independent of @xmath143 .",

    "we have studied the quantum effects due to radiation pressure in a high - finesse cavity with a mirror coated on a mechanical resonator .",
    "we have shown that the optomechanical coupling _  _ between the gaussian laser beam and the acoustic modes of the resonator leads to a non - linear phase shift for the light .",
    "this phase shift is related to the intracavity intensity through an effective susceptibility which takes into account all the acoustic modes and their coupling to the light .",
    "this susceptibility also describes the effect on the light of the brownian motion of the mirror .",
    "we have studied the quantum noise reduction of the field reflected by the cavity .",
    "this quantum effect mainly depends on the behavior of the non - linear phase shift at low frequency .  in this frequency domain",

    "we have shown that for a plano - convex resonator this effective mass is of the order of the optical mass which corresponds to the volume of the resonator illuminated by the light .",
    "the effective mass can be two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the total mass of the mirror and large quantum effects are obtained for a reasonable input power when the optical waist is small enough .",
    "this drastic decrease of the effective mass seems to be a specific behavior of the plano - convex geometry .",
    "the effective susceptibility of a cylindrical mirror has already been determined at low frequency for the study of thermal effects in gravitational - wave detectors@xcite .",
    "the reduction of the effective mass does not exceed a factor 10 below the total mass of the mirror .",
    "the plano - convex geometry thus allows to get simultaneously a high resonance frequency and a very small mass so thatlarge quantum noise reduction can be obtained over a wide frequency range .",
    "one can of course obtain significant non - linear phase shifts with a cylindrical mirror but the fundamental resonance frequency is very low .",
    "finally , we have only studied in this paper the quantum noise reduction of the field reflected by the cavity .",

    "for example it has been shown that the quantum limit for measurement sensitivity is proportional to the susceptibility characterizing the mirror motion@xcite .",
