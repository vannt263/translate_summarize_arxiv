    "quantum correlations , which lie in the foundations of quantum theory , have been of renewed interest during the last two decades as the field of quantum information science emerged and matured . quantum entanglement , as a kind of quantum correlations , has been playing central roles in quantum information and computation @xcite .",
    "the negativity is one of the best known and most popular tools of quantifying bipartite quantum entanglement .",
    "it can be computed easily for arbitrary states of a composite system .",
    "therefore , it has received various studies @xcite . however , quantum entanglement does not account for all of the non - classical properties of quantum phenomenons .",
    "therefore , numerous quantifiers of quantum correlations have been further proposed to reveal the non - classical correlations that can not be fully captured by quantum entanglement @xcite . among the various measures",
    ", it has been shown that quantum discord provides a larger region of quantum states with non - classical correlations , and a non - zero discord quantum state without entanglement may be responsible for the efficiency of a quantum computer .",
    "therefore , much attention has been paid to study the quantum discord in various quantum systems @xcite . however , due to the complicated optimization , it is usually complicated to calculate quantum discord analytically . even for qubit - qubit quantum systems , the analytical formula of quantum discord",
    "can only be obtained for a few cases , and a general method is still lacking . as a variant of quantum discord , geometric discord ( gd ) was introduced by dakic and coworkers @xcite . due to its simplicity in calculation",
    ", it has attracted a lot of research interests @xcite .",
    "it is well known that quantum systems inevitably interact with the environment when quantum information is processed in the real - world , which brings about the loss of initially presented quantum properties @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be characterized by decoherence , which can be illustrated by the example of faithfully transmitting an unknown quantum state through a noisy quantum channel . during the transmission ,",
    "the carrier of the information interacts with the channel and gets correlated with other degrees of freedom .",
    "this gives rise to the phenomenon of so - called decoherence on the subspace of the information carrier .",
    "recent studies on open quantum systems highlight the existence of two different classes of dynamical behaviours known as markovian and non - markovian regimes @xcite . in the quantum domain , under certain assumptions ,",
    "markovian dynamics lead to a master equation in the lindblad form .",
    "however , in certain scenarios such approximations are not justified and one needs to go beyond perturbation theory .",
    "it is clear that , due to the general complexity of the problem to be studied , exact solutions exist only for simple open quantum systems models such as the well - known jaynes - cummings model , quantum brownian motion model , and certain pure dephasing models @xcite . for the deeper understanding of quantum phenomenons",
    ", it is desirable to investigate the behaviours of the quantum properties under the action of decoherence .",
    "the previous work showed that quantum discord and entanglement behave differently under the effect of the environment @xcite .",
    "in particular , for certain quantum states , the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death does not occur for quantum discord .",
    "there exists some studies on the quantum correlations of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit systems under the effect of local quantum noises in the markovian environment @xcite .",
    "the importance of quantum states with higher dimensions is gradually recognized in recent years @xcite .",
    "therefore , a deep understanding of the quantum correlations dynamics of the high - dimensional quantum systems beyond qubits is very practical .",
    "song et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the distillability in qutrit - qutrit systems under local dephasing channels , and found that the distillability will be decrease after a finite time .",
    "m. ali studied the distillability sudden death in qutrit - qutrit systems under global and multilocal dephasing @xcite , and amplitude damping channels @xcite .",
    "he has found that the quantum entanglement will decrease after a finite time under dicoherence .",
    "guo et al .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamics of quantum correlations of qubit - qutrit systems under various decoherent channels .",
    "they have shown that the decoherent channels bring with different influences for the dynamics of quantum correlations measured by negativity , quantum discord and gd .",
    "the influences depend on the initial state parameters and the properties of the decoherent channels . in this work",
    ", we will study the quantum correlations in qutrit - qutrit systems under identical and non - identical local noise channels .",
    "we consider four kinds of local noise channels on each qutrit , including dephasing , trit - flip , trit - phase - flip , and depolarising channels .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we will introduce the negativity and the gd as our measures of quantum correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , the evolution of the quantum correlations for a qutrit - qutrit system under the identical and non - identical local noise channels are discussed .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in this section , we will describe the gd and the negativity in a brief manner .",
    "the negativity is a useful entanglement measure for arbitrary bipartite state quantum systems @xcite , especially for free entangled states . for a given density matrix @xmath0 ,",
    "its negativity will be @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the partial transpose of @xmath0 with respect to subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath4 represents the trace norm .",
    "if @xmath5 , then the bipartite state is free entangled .",
    "[ [ gd ] ] gd ~~    geometric measure of quantum discord in a bipartite state can be described as the distance of the state from the closest zero - discord state @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hilbert - schmidt norm and @xmath8 is the set of all zero discord states . for a general bipartite state of @xmath9 dimensions ,",
    "the density matrix can be written as @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the generators of @xmath15 and @xmath16 groups ( special unitary groups of dimensions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ) , satisfying the relation @xmath19 .",
    "the lower bound @xcite of the gd has been derived as @xmath20 where @xmath21 with bloch vector @xmath22 with elements @xmath23 , matrix @xmath24 is the correlation matrix with elements @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath27 arranged in non - increasing order .",
    "we will use the lower bound as the estimation of the gd in the following .",
    "let us consider a qutrit - qutrit system with each particle interacts independently with the local noise channels . in this case",
    ", the evolution of a quantum state can be described by the lindblad equation , which can be written in terms of the kraus operators as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the kraus operators characterizing the local noise channels on @xmath3 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "they satisfy @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .    to study the dynamics of quantum correlations for a qutrit - qutrit system , we choose the bell state @xmath34 as the initial quantum state . in the following , we will study the dynamics of the quantum correlations of @xmath35 under the effect of four different noise channels .",
    "physically , dephasing corresponds to any process of losing coherence without the exchange of energy . under the action of dephasing noises , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix decay",
    "exponentially against time . for two local dephasing noises on qutrits @xmath3 and @xmath31 , the kraus operators are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 or @xmath31 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 denoting the decay rates of qutrits @xmath3 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "for trit - flip channels of qutrits @xmath3 and @xmath31 , the kraus operators are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44      the kraus operators are @xmath45 where @xmath46                      the kraus operators are @xmath47 where @xmath48      based on the numerical simulations , we give our results in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] for each two identical dephasing , trit - flip , trit - phase - filp , and depolarizing channels , respectively .",
    "one can observe that under the effect of two identical noise channels , as @xmath49 or @xmath50 increases , the negativity and the gd decrease rapidly ( see @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the figures ) , which indicates that quantum correlation is strongly affected by large decay rates @xcite . by observing figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , one can see that the gd is more robust than the negativity ageist two identical dephasing and trit - flip noise channels . however , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , for two identical tirt - phase - flip and depolarizing channels , the negativity becomes more robust than the gd . to study the effect of the decay rates of the channels ,",
    "we draw the negativity and the gd versus the decay rates @xmath49 or @xmath50 in three - dimension figures with a fixed time @xmath53 ( see @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the figures ) .",
    "it can been seen that in the case where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are large , the negativity and the gd are influenced strongly during the decoherence .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the negativity and the gd under non - identical local noise channels , namely , the noise channels are of different types and decay rates .",
    "the kraus operators have been given in sec .",
    "[ idt ] .",
    "the results are drawn in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , and [ fig10 ] for dephasing - trit flip channels , dephasing - trit phase flip channels , dephasing - depolarising channels , trit flip - trit phase flip channels , trit flip - depolarising channels , and trit phase flip - depolarising channels respectively .",
    "it can be seen that under the effect of two different local noise channels , the negativity and the gd behave similar to the case where the channels are identical .",
    "one can observe that in all cases of non - identical local noise channels the gd is more robust than the negativity .",
    "same in the identical channels , as the time elapsed the state losses its quantum entanglement . to study just the effect of rate of the channels we draw the negativity and the gd versus the rates of two channels in three dimensions at a fixed time @xmath53 ( see @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the figures ) .",
    "as the rates of the channels are large , the negativity and the gd decease rapidly .",
    "to summarize , in this work , we have studied the quantum correlations of a qutrit - qutrit quantum system under identical and non - identical local noise channels by using the negativity and the gd .",
    "we have considered four kinds of local noise channels on each qutrit , including dephasing , trit - flip , trit - phase - flip , and depolarising channels .",
    "meanwhile , we have further investigated the effect of various combinations local noise channels on the quantum correlation .",
    "the results show that the quantum correlations decrease monotonically with time under decoherence . meanwhile , when the time is fixed , negativity and geometric discord decrease rapidly when the decay rates are large .",
    "we expect our work may find further theoretical and experimental applications .",
