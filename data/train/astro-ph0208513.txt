    "balqsos  quasars that have broad absorption lines in their spectra  can be divided into lobals and hibals , which do and do not have strong absorption lines produced by low  ionization species such as mg  ii , al  iii , and fe  ii .",
    "lobals that have numerous lines from excited states of fe  ii are called felobals ( becker et  al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "the usual interpretation of the spectrum of an felobal qso is similar to that of the spectra of other balqsos .",
    "the effective continuous spectrum consists of a true continuum from the accretion disk , plus broad emission lines ( bels ) that form in a surrounding region  the belr .",
    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) are superimposed on the effective continuum as it passes through a separate region  the balr .",
    "the distance of the balr from the qso center may be large compared to the size of the belr , and the global covering factor  the fraction of the sky covered by the balr as viewed from the center of the qso  may be small .    in this _",
    "letter _ we explore an alternative interpretation of the spectrum of a particular felobal qso . in our simple model , the rest ",
    "frame uv spectrum consists of p  cygni features formed by resonance scattering , superimposed on a continuum .",
    "the line emission and absorption components come from the same spherically ",
    "symmetric line  forming region  the lfr . to illustrate this interpretation we concentrate on an felobal that was discovered in the first bright quasar survey ( white et  al .",
    "2000 ) and is designated first j121442.3 + 280329 , or 214 for short .",
    "we choose this particular felobal because it has recently been analyzed in detail , in the context of the usual bal model , by de  kool et  al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter dk02 ) , and because its spectrum , although rich in lines , appears to be amenable to an analysis based on a single lfr . in ",
    "2 we describe the modeling of 214 by dk02 . the alternative resonance ",
    "scattering interpretation is presented in  3 .",
    "some of the implications of the resonance  scattering model , and its possible applicability to other qsos , are briefly discussed in  4 .",
    "because we make use of the results of dk02 , and we want to compare and contrast the results of our model and theirs , we must first briefly describe their analysis .",
    "they studied a spectrum obtained on 1998 may  18 using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et  al .",
    "1994 ) on the keck  i 10  m telescope .",
    "the redshift was determined to be @xmath0",
    ".    in their analysis dk02 used effective continuous spectra that consisted of a power  law continuum plus fe  ii and mg  ii bels .",
    "the mg  ii bel was the sum of two gaussians centered on the two components of the mg  ii @xmath1 doublet ( @xmath22796 , 2803 ) .",
    "two different templates for the fe  ii bels were considered .",
    "the first consisted of a linear combination of five sets of fe  ii bels from theoretical model calculations ( verner et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and the second was the observed fe  ii bel spectrum of the strong emission ",
    "line qso 22263905 ( graham , clowes , & campusano 1996 ) .    for the absorption features",
    ", dk02 obtained a template distribution of line optical depth with respect to velocity in the balr from the observed absorption profile of fe  ii @xmath3 , an apparently unblended line of moderate strength .",
    "given the assumption that only absorption takes place in the balr , the optical depth was obtained from @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fractional residual flux in the absorption feature .",
    "the resulting optical  depth distribution extended from about 1200 to 2700  and peaked near 2100  .",
    "this optical  depth distribution , scaled in amplitude , was used for all absorption lines . for each of the absorbing ions that were introduced",
    " fe  ii , mg  ii , cr  ii , and mn  ii  the column density was a fitting parameter .",
    "the relative strengths of the lines of each ion turned out to be consistent with lte .",
    "three models that differed in their details ( see dk02 ) were presented , with similar results .",
    "the column densities of fe  ii , cr  ii , and mn  ii were well constrained .",
    "( the column density of mg  ii could not be well constrained because the only mg  ii absorption , due to @xmath1 , is saturated . )",
    "the excitation temperature was found to be near 10,000  k. two local covering factors , representing the fractions of the power  law source and the belr that are covered by the balr as viewed by the observer , were introduced to reproduce the observed `` non  black saturation ''  the fact that in the observed spectrum even very strong absorption features do not go to zero flux .",
    "both local covering factors were found to be @xmath6 .",
    "a detailed view of the spectral fit for one of the models was presented , and practically all of the observed absorptions were reasonably well accounted for .",
    "to further interpret the results of their spectrum fits dk02 then used the photoionization ",
    "equilibrium code cloudy ( ferland 2000 ) to compute a grid of constant  density slab models irradiated by a range of ionizing spectra .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath7 , the hydrogen density @xmath8 , and the hydrogen column density @xmath9 were found to satisfy @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . from these values the distance of the balr from the center of the qso was inferred to be between 1 and 30  pc .",
    "we explore a resonance - scattering interpretation using synthetic spectra generated with the fast , parameterized synthetic  spectrum code synow , which often is used for making line identifications and initial coarse analyses of photospheric  phase supernova spectra .",
    "the use of synow , as well as more elaborate and physically self  consistent spectrum ",
    "synthesis codes such as phoenix , for the analysis of supernova spectra is reviewed by branch , baron , & jeffery ( 2002 ) .",
    "synow assumes spherical symmetry and a sharp photosphere that emits a blackbody continuum characterized by temperature @xmath13 .",
    "expansion velocity is proportional to radius , as expected for matter that has been coasting at constant velocity after an impulsive ejection with a range of velocities .",
    "line formation , treated in the sobolev approximation , occurs by resonance scattering of photons from the photosphere .",
    "line blending ( multiple scattering ) is treated exactly , within the context of the sobolev approximation .",
    "line optical depths are taken to decrease with radius according to a power law . for each ion whose lines",
    "are introduced , the optical depth of a `` reference line '' at the inner boundary of the lfr is a fitting parameter , and the optical depths of the other lines of the ion are determined by assuming lte level populations at excitation temperature @xmath14 .",
    "oscillator strengths are from kurucz ( 1993 ) . in supernovae ,",
    "line formation ordinarily takes place immediately above the photosphere , i.e. , the bottom of the lfr has the velocity at the photosphere , @xmath15 , but sometimes it is appropriate to `` detach '' the lines of an ion by allowing line formation only above some velocity @xmath16 that exceeds @xmath15 .",
    "individual values of @xmath16 , and also of @xmath17 , can be assigned to each ion .    for 214  we use @xmath18  k to approximate the shape of the underlying continuum , we take @xmath19  k from the analysis of dk02 , and we introduce only lines of mg  ii , fe  ii , and cr  ii .",
    "( in the synthetic spectrum of dk02 the mn  ii lines play only a minor role . )",
    "the index of the optical  depth power law is taken to be @xmath20 for all ions .",
    "1 compares the strong observed feature produced by mg  ii @xmath1 with a synthetic spectrum that contains only lines of mg  ii and has @xmath21 , @xmath22  .",
    "the synthetic p  cygni profile is so saturated that it not sensitive to the optical depth distribution , only to the values of @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting that the observed feature can be fit this well with the simple assumption of resonance scattering in a spherically symmetric lfr .",
    "note that no local covering factor has had to be introduced ; because line emission and absorption take place in the same lfr , the saturated absorption feature does not go black .",
    "fig .  2 compares the spectrum of 214 with a synthetic spectrum that contains lines of mg  ii , fe  ii , and cr  ii , all with @xmath23 . in order to make their absorption components blueshifted enough ,",
    "the fe  ii and cr  ii lines have @xmath24 . cr  ii and fe  ii contribute some lines of weak and moderate strength to the right of the mg  ii feature , while fe  ii lines dominate the spectrum to the left of the mg  ii feature .",
    "the overall fit is good , although there are some discrepancies .",
    "the fact that the synthetic continuum goes too high at the red end of the spectrum is not a serious concern because there is no reason that the true continuum should be that of a blackbody .",
    "the strong fe  ii blends near 2740 , 2620 , and 2400    are reasonably well matched , although now that the mg  ii feature is blended with numerous fe  ii lines it does not fit as well as in fig .  1",
    ". the cr  ii absorption to the right of the mg  ii emission is too strong",
    ". a closer look at a crowded part of the spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that most of the details are fit rather well , considering the simplicity of our model and especially that we are using a power  law optical  depth distribution rather than a customized ( template ) distribution of optical depth with respect to velocity .",
    "why do the fe  ii and cr  ii features form only above 1800  while mg  ii forms above 1000  ?",
    "the simplest possibility is that the true optical  depth distributions of mg  ii , fe  ii , and cr  ii lines with respect to velocity are of similar shape , but their relative amplitudes are such that the optical depths of the fe  ii and cr  ii lines are less than unity below 1800  while the optical depth of the very strong mg  ii resonance feature is well above unity .",
    "an extension of the synthetic spectrum of fig  2 . to longer wavelengths is practically featureless . for anything like solar abundances , the only lines in the rest ",
    "frame optical spectrum that necessarily should be expected in this model are the hydrogen lines , although some lines of other ions that we have not used for the uv spectrum , such as the h&k lines of ca  ii , might have significant optical depths .",
    "an extension of the synthetic spectrum of fig .",
    "2 to wavelengths shorter than 2300    has numerous features of moderate strength , and strong features also are to be expected from ions such as al  iii and al  ii that are not needed for fig .  2 .",
    "the resonance  scattering model can fit the spectrum of 214 rather well with simple assumptions , and if we were to introduce a customized distribution of optical depth with respect to velocity the fit certainly could be improved .",
    "nevertheless , the model is at best an idealization , and it needs more study before we can be sure that it is applicable .",
    "our use of an @xmath20 power law for the optical depths is just illustrative because here a power  law has no particular justification ; the 8000  k blackbody continuum is just a surrogate for the real continuum from the central source ; and our assumption that velocity is proportional to distance from the center may not be correct .",
    "the most important feature of this model is that the red side of the emission component comes from the far side of the qso rather from a central belr , so it would mean that the lfr is more or less spherically symmetric and continuous and the global covering factor is large . since emission and absorption components come from the same lfr , the fact that the same lines are observed in emission and absorption would necessarily follow .",
    "local covering factors would not necessarily be required to account for non  black saturation . for lines of more than moderate",
    "strength , column densities inferred from the resonance scattering intepretation would be higher than those inferred from the standard model because with the presence of emission in the lfr , larger optical depths would be required to match a given absorption depth in the observed spectrum . thus the excitation temperature inferred from a detailed line by line study could change .    taking @xmath25 from becker",
    "( 2000 ) and assuming a standard agn spectral energy distribution ( mathews & ferland 1987 ) we estimate the luminosity of 214 to be roughly @xmath26 erg  s@xmath27 . if , for example , the luminosity is ten percent of the eddington luminosity then the black  hole mass is @xmath28  m@xmath29 , and the escape velocity falls to 1000  at a radius near 20  pc .",
    "if the inner radius of the lfr is at least this large , then the lfr does not contain a true photosphere , because a blackbody having @xmath30  k and @xmath31 erg  s@xmath27 would have a radius of only @xmath32 cm , or 0.045  pc .",
    "the column density of singly ionized iron required to produce the weak fe  ii lines is @xmath33 @xmath34 ( dk02 ) , which with a solar iron abundance and _ all _ iron being singly ionized corresponds to a bare minimum hydrogen column density of @xmath35 @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lfr is optically thick to electron scattering the column density exceeds @xmath36 @xmath34 .",
    "then the mass of the lfr could be large , @xmath37  m@xmath29 , where @xmath38 is the inner radius of the shell in units of 20  pc and @xmath39 is the column density in units of @xmath36 @xmath34 .",
    "the kinetic  energy luminosity of @xmath40 erg  s@xmath27 is not necessarily large compared to the qso luminosity but the mass flow rate of @xmath41  m@xmath29  y@xmath27 may be large compared to the accretion rate required to provide the qso luminosity ( @xmath42m@xmath29  y@xmath27 , if the efficiency of conversion of accretion energy to radiation is ten percent ) , in which case the lfr is a consequence not of a steady  state wind but an episodic ejection .",
    "resonance scattering in differentially expanding lfrs having high global covering factors was explored years ago ( e.g. , scargle , caroff , & noerdlinger 1970 ; surdej & swings 1981 ; drew & giddings 1982 , surdej & hutsemkers 1987 ) but it fell out of favor as a model for balqsos in general , for various reasons .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found that hibals and non  balqsos have similar emission lines , suggestive of a single population of qsos having a small global covering factor , with hibals being seen from a special orientation .",
    "line equivalent widths often are too small to account for the photons scattered out of the deep absorption troughs ( barring some photon destruction mechanism , e.g. , absorption by dust ) ; from analysis of emission and absorption line profiles hamann , korista & morris ( 1993 ) concluded that high global covering fractions were not favored for the hibals of the weymann et  al . sample .",
    "however , becker et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and gregg et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) have argued against the usual scenario that balqsos are normal quasars seen edge  on , and in favor of an alternative picture in which balqsos are an early stage in the development of new or refueled quasars .",
    "( evolution , not orientation . )",
    "we suggest that the resonance ",
    "scattering model should be reconsidered , for the felobal qsos .",
    "our preliminary modeling of the spectra of felobals other than 214 indicates that the resonant  scattering model is able to account for the spectra of at least some of them .",
    "although the model clearly is not applicable to all balqsos , it may have some relevance to lobal qsos in general .",
    "lobals have different emission ",
    "line properties from hibals , including a small equivalent width of [ o  iii ] @xmath43 ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) .",
    "the [ o iii ] line is produced far enough from the center of the qso that its emission should be isotropic ( kuraszkiewicz et al . 2000 ) , therefore a small equivalent width may imply a high global covering factor ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "large column densities and global covering factors may alleviate the current discrepancy between uv and x - ray column densities .",
    "green et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that lobals are weaker x - ray sources than hibals , implying higher column densities for lobals .",
    "other evidence that has been cited for high column densities includes reddened optical and uv spectra ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; boroson & meyers 1992 ; egami et  al.1996 ; brotherton et  al .",
    "2001 ) and large balmer decrements ( egami et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , if the mass outflow rates are too high to be maintained in steady  state , the outflows may originate from episodic ejections , perhaps associated with the turning on of qsos ( hazard et  al .",
    "lobals may be young quasars in the act of casting off their cocoons of gas and dust ( voit et  al .",
    "1993 ) , related to ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( egami 1999 ) .",
    "becker et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that felobals may be the missing link between galaxies and quasars .",
    "it appears that for some qsos the simple synow code may be useful for making rapid explorations and gaining some insight .",
    "however , we have merely characterized the lfr without explaining how it is heated , and we have ignored the implication from the observed spectropolarization of felobals ( brotherton et  al .",
    "1997 ; hutsemkers , lamy , & remy 1998 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ; lamy & hutsemkers 2000 ) that not all components can be spherically symmetric .",
    "detailed physically self  consistent calculations with more powerful synthetic  spectrum codes such as phoenix must be the basis for ultimate decisions about the viability of the model sketched here .",
    "we intend to undertake such calculations for felobals .",
