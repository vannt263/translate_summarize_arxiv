    "the standard model of particle physics is believed to be an effective theory valid up to energies close to 1 tev .",
    "however , no new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been observed yet , and it is critical to explore a wide range of possible signatures .",
    "a promising avenue lies in final states that involve the heaviest of the particles presumed to be elementary : the top quark .",
    "this document describes two searches for new phenomena involving top quarks using the atlas detector  @xcite at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the first search is carried out for a pair - produced exotic top partner ( @xmath1 ) , decaying to a top - antitop pair and two stable , neutral weakly - interacting particles ( @xmath2 , which in some models may be its own anti - particle )  @xcite . in most models , the @xmath1 has typical quark - like quantum numbers , and is produced through @xmath3 annihilation and gluon fusion .",

    "many of these models provide a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and predict dark matter candidates , which can be identified indirectly through their large  signature . the search is carried out in the @xmath8 lepton+jets channel where one @xmath9 boson from the top quark decay decays leptonically ( including @xmath10 decays to @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) and the other @xmath9 boson decays hadronically , resulting in a final state with an isolated lepton of high transverse momentum , four or more jets and large .",

    "the latter cut ensures that the sample is orthogonal to the signal selection .",
    "the sample is expected to contain over 95% @xmath9+jets events , and remaining contributions from other standard model processes are subtracted using mc predictions prior to the fit .",
    "note that the resulting scale factors are heavily anticorrelated , which is taken into account in the evaluation of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties in the scale factors arise from the limited size of the data sample .",

    "the @xmath82 cut removes jets that are `` far '' from the rest of the activity in the event .",
