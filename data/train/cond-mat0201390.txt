    "recent experiments have led to a renewed theoretical interest in disordered spin - peierls systems .",
    "for example , the doped one - dimensional heisenberg system cu@xmath0zn@xmath1geo@xmath2 @xcite shows two subsequent magnetic transitions , the spin - peierls transition at @xmath3 k followed by a transition to an antiferromagnetic ground - state at @xmath4 k , while in cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 , a reentrant spin - peierls phase for @xmath5 @xcite is observed .",
    "in fact , the general question of the effect of various types of impurities in pure @xcite or gapped spin systems @xcite has been studied intensively during the last years . nevertheless , the interplay between interaction , disorder , and periodic distortions is still a challenging problem .",
    "the model of spinless fermions , which is considered here in detail , is equivalent to the anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "it describes certain aspects of magnetic and electronic systems , and the phase diagram of this ",
    "simplest \" interacting fermion model is surprisingly rich . on the basis of this model ,",
    "the aim of this work is thus to achieve a better understanding of the ground - state properties of disordered spin- and interacting fermi - systems , especially clarifying the role of the interaction , which may enhance or decrease the localization due to the random and periodic perturbations . in particular",
    ", we will introduce and compare the effects of various kinds of impurities .",
    "in this context , eggert and affleck @xcite pointed out that two  classes \" of impurities exist , which differ in their effect on the local symmetry of the system .",
    "so - called  site - impurities \" violate the site parity by affecting one site or bond , whereas ",
    "bond - impurities \" , which modify two neighbouring bonds , violate the bond symmetry but respect the site parity .",
    "bearing this in mind , we use the name site- or bond - impurity . note",
    "that this naming is different from the one used in @xcite and @xcite , where an impurity on a single site is called site - impurity , and an impurity on a bond is called bond - impurity .",
    "another type ,  transparent \" impurities , which we do not consider here , can be constructed using the bethe - ansatz @xcite : those defects are similar to bond - impurities , but include also a coupling between the next - nearest neighbours around the impurity .",
    "transparent impurities have also been studied extensively with analytic and numerical techniques during the last years , see for example @xcite and @xcite . as a result of eggert and affleck ,",
    "a site - impurity is relevant in the sense that it can break up a closed ring , whereas a bond - impurity is irrelevant , i.  e.  the defect is healed at low energies .",
    "gapped spin systems containing irrelevant impurities , i.  e.  impurities which do not close the gap in the system , are supposed to be equivalent to free dirac - fermions with random mass , a model which has been widely investigated in one dimension @xcite in the context of doped spin - peierls or spin - ladder systems and two dimensions @xcite in the context of the quantum hall effect . however , the transformation to dirac fermions is valid only for special points in the parameter space , which correspond to the xy model ( free fermions ) for the dimerized system , or the isotropic xxx - heisenberg antiferromagnet for the ladder model .",
    "the numerical density matrix renormalization group @xcite is a quasi - exact numerical method to determine the ground state properties , in particular the ground - state energy , of long one - dimensional ( non - integrable ) systems with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the bosonization technique @xcite can be used with advantage to interpret the numerical data .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce the models and the impurity types studied by us . using the bosonization technique and the luttinger description ,",
    "we then identify the leading non - linear operators , and classify the impurities according to them .",
    "the results for single defects are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . concerning the dimerized system , we concentrate in our discussion on strong site- and bond - impurities .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , followed by a summary in sec .",
    "we begin by presenting the generic spin model , and then describe the equivalent fermionic model .",
    "then we briefly introduce the luttinger description , which is useful for discussing the relevant operators which lead to insulating behaviour .      as a starting point for the study of a general disordered spin - peierls system in one dimension",
    ", we consider an anisotropic heisenberg chain , given by the xxz model , with a dimerized interaction : @xmath6 where the dimerization in the peierls state , @xmath7 , enters the coupling constant according to @xmath8 $ ] . for the clean xxz model ,",
    "i.  e.  for @xmath9 , and for zero total magnetisation , @xmath10 , one finds three phases : a ferromagnetic phase for @xmath11 , separated by a first - order transition from a gapless phase for @xmath12 , whose low lying excitations are given by those of a luttinger liquid ; and an antiferromagnetic phase for @xmath13 .",
    "the transition from the luttinger to the antiferromagnetic phase is of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type . adding the dimerization , @xmath7 , the system becomes localized by forming spin - singlets on neighbouring sites for @xmath14 , i.e. for antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "an excitation gap opens due to the usual peierls mechanism @xcite .",
    "leaving aside the question whether a finite @xmath7 can be stabilized , we note that the dimerization is already relevant for @xmath15 @xcite , and the ground - state wave function is localized .",
    "the interaction - dimerization phase diagram was determined in @xcite .",
    "impurities may be realized in three different ways .",
    "first , local magnetic fields may be present , resulting for example from magnetic impurities near the chain , which couple directly to the @xmath16-component at a specific site .",
    "we call this kind of impurity a site - impurity .",
    "second , the coupling between the spins may be modified locally by a factor @xmath17 , for example by substituting sr with la or ge with si in a spin chain compound like la@xmath1sr@xmath18cuo@xmath2 or cuge@xmath0si@xmath1o@xmath2 . as only one link",
    "is concerned this is similar to a local field ; nevertheless we call it link - impurity in the following .",
    "the third possibility is to modify both bonds to the left and to the right of the impurity site by an equal amount , @xmath19 : this situation , which is called bond - impurity , can be realized by doping magnetic impurities with spin 1/2 into a chain , e.  g.  substituting v by nb .",
    "( nevertheless , in some cases it is found that the free nb - electron  with the spin  moves to the vanadium site , i.  e.  a nb@xmath20- and a v@xmath21-site is established instead of nb@xmath22 and v@xmath22 . ) completing the hamiltonian in this way , we can write @xmath23 with @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 is a fixed site .",
    "the corresponding fermionic model is obtained via the jordan - wigner transformation . in the result",
    "we change the notation , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , and neglect constant energy shifts , like @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of fermions : @xmath32,\\label{secondline}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 $ ] , and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the coupling to ( static ) phonons and to the impurities can be varied independently in both the hopping and the interaction , by introducing six parameter ( @xmath35 ) instead of three ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the particle density is @xmath37 , and we restrict ourselves to half filling ; we set @xmath38 in some of the formulas below . as shown in @xcite",
    ", @xmath39 is the main contribution arising from the dimerization , whereas @xmath40 modifies the results only quantitatively but not qualitatively ; thus we assume @xmath41 . for simplicity",
    ", we likewise neglect to avoid the mixing  in the fermionic picture  of bond- and site - impurity . in the case of the link - impurity , it was shown by meden et al .",
    "@xcite that the weakening of one bond in the spin model is equivalent to an impurity given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , i.  e.  that the contribution is of lesser importance .",
    "we assume that the same holds for the bond - impurity .",
    "the in this way simplified hamiltonian is then given by @xmath44 \\left ( c^+_ic^{\\hphantom + } _ { i+1 } + c^+_{i+1}c^{\\hphantom + } _ { i } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & &        + \\sum_i   v[1-\\delta_{i , m}\\delta_v-(\\delta_{i , m}+\\delta_{i , m+1})b_v ] + \\sum_i \\epsilon_in_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the link - impurity can occur as a pure hopping - impurity , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , or a generic link - impurity , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "setting @xmath49 , we can also realize an interaction - impurity by varying @xmath43 . in the following we consider the hamiltonian given by eq . only .      for the interpretation of the numerical data , we use the fact that in the gapless phase the system",
    "can be described by a luttinger liquid , and that the distortions can be considered as a perturbation . in the bosonized form @xcite , the hamiltonian can be written for the `` clean '' model as follows : @xmath50 ^ 2 + vg\\left[\\pi\\pi_\\varphi(x , t)\\right]^2 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the momentum density conjugate to @xmath52 , i.  e.  it corresponds to @xmath53 in the ( euclidean ) path integral formulation of the theory .",

    "we will use the phase sensitivity , i.  e.  the reaction of the system to a change in the boundary condition , to determine the localized - delocalized transition numerically for systems with finite size .",
    "we model the different boundary condition via a magnetic flux , penetrating the ring of the spinless fermions . the effect of the magnetic flux results in an additional phase of the hopping terms , @xmath94 , with @xmath95 .",
    "the energy levels depend only on the total flux , @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , we determine below the energy difference between periodic ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) and anti - periodic ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) boundary conditions , @xmath101 . here",
    "the factor @xmath102 cancels the odd - even effects resulting from the change in the ground - state for odd versus even particle numbers .",
    "we recall that , for a clean system , the ground - state energy and the finite - size corrections can be obtained from the bethe ansatz @xcite . at half filling ( and for odd particle number ) , the result , in the luttinger regime , is given by @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the energy density in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus @xmath105 , independent of @xmath106 , for the metallic state . in an insulator ,",
    "on the other hand , we find localized levels and the system can not react to a twist in the boundary condition , i.  e.   @xmath107 is expected to decrease with system size . considering the above model , in which the contributions of the local potential and the weakening of the neighbouring bonds are taken into account separately ,",
    "the localized levels do not split off the continuous spectrum @xcite , and the phase sensitivity is an appropriate observable .",
    "a local magnetic field , which corresponds to a local potential , is the well - known and most studied example of a site - impurity . in this case",
    ", the free motion of the fermions inside the ring is restricted by the back - scattering at the impurity ( @xmath108 ) . as discussed by kane and fisher @xcite",
    "the impurity becomes transparent for an attractive , and completely reflective for a repulsive interaction , according to the renormalization group equation @xmath109 in other words , the impurity strength scales either to zero or to infinity , for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the fact that an impurity scales to zero for repulsive interaction is confirmed by the scaling of a weak link @xcite . for strong @xmath112",
    "the effective hopping is given by @xmath113 .",
    "the final result for the phase sensitivity is obtained by perturbation theory with respect to the defect strength , see @xcite and @xcite , and is given by @xmath114 in the weak scattering limit , and by @xmath115 in the strong impurity limit , where @xmath116 is a cut - off corresponding to a momentum cut - off of the order of the fermi momentum .",
    "as a summary , we show numerical data in fig .",
    "the most important result is that an intermediate defect strength scales to zero for attractive interaction , and to infinity for repulsive interaction , rather than scaling to an additional intermediate fixed point .",
    "we begin by checking whether the above expressions for the weak and strong potential , eqs . and , can be applied to the case of a modified link , as should be expected from the treatment in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we therefore calculate the phase sensitivity for a weakly modified link , @xmath117 , and a weak link , @xmath118 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tfit ] .",
    "however , the above expressions do not apply : instead of eq .",
    "we find for the weakly modified link @xmath119 this is actually the scaling according to eq . .",
    "therefore , eq . does not appropriately describe this impurity type .",
    "similarly , for the weak link , we do not recover eq .",
    ", but instead @xmath120 in this case @xmath121 , as we connect two chains of length @xmath122 .",
    "next we verify that the generic link - impurity can be written as a sum of a hopping- and an interaction - impurity , as the bosonized hamiltonians , eqs . and ,",
    "suggest . as shown on the l.  h.  s.  of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the three cases : @xmath123 and @xmath46 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 and @xmath49 , are compared , this conjecture is indeed confirmed .",
    "the qualitative behaviour is the same for all defect types . by comparing two different system sizes",
    ", we can fix the transition point to @xmath126 in all cases .",
    "if the impurity is so strong that the sign of the hopping or the interaction changes , @xmath127 , interaction dependent maxima occur , in addition , for the generic link - impurity , see the r.  h.  s.  of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .      for the non - interacting system ( @xmath126 ) with one bond - impurity",
    ", it is easily seen that the back - scattering contributions , i.  e.  the fourier components with @xmath128 in the half - filled case , cancel each other as is the case for two site - impurities at an odd distance .",
    "for this reason , we presume that the phase sensitivity increases slightly with system size according to @xmath129 also in the interacting system . for repulsive interaction the results of eggert & affleck @xcite show that this kind of perturbation is irrelevant and the system remains metallic . for an attractive interaction , the behaviour",
    "is expected to be similar .",
    "accordingly , the results for _ integrable , triangle like defects _",
    "@xcite show that the phase sensitivity is slightly reduced for non - interacting fermions in the presence of such ( transparent ) impurities .",
    "in particular , a repulsive interaction leads to stronger suppression of the phase sensitivity than an attractive one .",
    "the numerical data presented in the left part of fig . [ figb ] confirm this assertion of an only slight reduction : clearly the system behaves metallic for small @xmath130 .",
    "however , by increasing the impurity strength , strong deviations are visible , already for @xmath131 at @xmath132 .",
    "the value of the interaction , where this strong decrease is seen , moves to a larger interaction when increasing the impurity strength , until the maximum reaches the repulsive regime for @xmath133 .",
    "using the scaling applicable for the weak link case , eq .",
    ", @xmath134 , a scaling relation for the two - weak - link case , given by the hamiltonian in eq . , can be derived , @xmath135 according to this scaling relation , the weak links increase for @xmath136 .",
    "thus , for an attractive interaction , there is an interaction value for which the phase sensitivity becomes independent of system size , while it scales to zero when further lowering the interaction down towards @xmath137 ( where the first - order transition takes place in the clean system ) .",
    "nevertheless , the system remains metallic in this region , but with a strongly reduced drude weight .",
    "this behaviour , see the r.  h.  s.  of fig .",
    "[ figb ] , is different from the behaviour of an integrable defect ( where a strong reduction arises for a repulsive interaction ) .",
    "we combine now two perturbations and study first a site - impurity in the dimerized system . for a first impression",
    ", we calculate the energy levels and the ground - state energy of of non - interacting particles with an alternating hopping , following the treatment in @xcite , but adding one potential scatterer of strength @xmath138 .",
    "the ground - state energy is given by @xmath139 with e@xmath140 the second complete elliptic integral , where @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 ; @xmath143 .",
    "a single impurity in the non - interacting alternating chain was also discussed in @xcite . thus the phase sensitivity is given by ,",
    "compare @xcite : @xmath144 figure [ uefit ] shows numerical data in comparison to this formula , with @xmath145 according to the cell doubling in the dimerized state .",
    "the length dependence presently is not as clear as for a single impurity or for the clean dimerized system : for @xmath111 the system is completely localized , the phase sensitivity decreases with system size , while for @xmath146 , the system appears to be delocalized . in between , for @xmath147 ,",
    "however , a characteristic system size @xmath148 $ ] can be defined . for @xmath106",
    "smaller than @xmath149 , the phase sensitivity increases with @xmath106 similar to the behaviour in the delocalized phase . increasing the system size above @xmath149 , however , the phase sensitivity decreases , indicative of localization . this intermediate regime",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ u1e10 ] , where we plot the phase sensitivity for a set of parameters which clearly shows the described behaviour .",
    ".[tab1]values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 for @xmath41 , and @xmath152 .",
    "the latter case is included for completeness , compare the discussion in subsection 2.2 , even though not mentioned separately in the text . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     an impurity with weak or intermediate strength enlarges the delocalized region of the dimerized model , as already shown in @xcite . for a strong barrier and a strong dimerization ,",
    "a new feature is observed : in addition to the enlargement of the delocalized region a peak in the phase sensitivity is found in the localized regime , for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the characteristic behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "[ u3e10 ] , demonstrating that the increase for a value of @xmath155 is already by one order of magnitude for @xmath156 .",
    "the assumption that the impurity becomes irrelevant at @xmath150 is consistent with the initial increase of the phase sensitivity at this value .",
    "since the effect of the dimerization is weakened by an impurity , the following ( by further lowering the interaction down to the value @xmath151 ) decrease of the phase sensitivity can be explained by the enhancement of the effective dimerization , caused by the diminished influence of the impurity .",
    "lowering the interaction further , the dimerization becomes irrelevant , too , and the system delocalizes .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the characteristic interaction values for this model .      while we analyzed above a single site - impurity in a dimerized ring ,",
    "we now concentrate on a single bond - impurity plus dimerization . based on the results of sec .",
    "[ secbond ] , we expect that for a weak distortion the system still shows the phase transition at @xmath157 , with the delocalized region extending to @xmath137 .",
    "increasing the strength of the bond - impurity , we also expect the unusual behaviour  as described above  for strong attractive interaction to occur in the dimerized system as well , because in this interaction regime the dimerization is irrelevant .",
    "the first conjecture can be confirmed numerically for strong dimerization but small @xmath130 .",
    "the numerical data for stronger distortion , i.  e. for increasing @xmath130 , show a more complex behaviour of the phase sensitivity , see fig .",
    "the first observation is , similar to a site - impurity , that the transition to the metallic state occurs at weaker interaction strength , e.  g.  for @xmath158 already at @xmath159 ( compared to @xmath160 in the undistorted case ) . also , the second conjecture is supported by the numerical data : for an interaction larger than @xmath160 the influence of the bond - impurity drives the systems again to a metallic state with a strongly reduced phase sensitivity . in between ,",
    "@xmath161 , the system flows to the free metallic fixed point when increasing the system size .",
    "our numerical studies of a one - dimensional spin chain , which is equivalent to a system of spinless interacting fermions , with various distortions show that both types of site - impurities are irrelevant for an attractive interaction ( using the fermion picture ) , and relevant for a repulsive one .",
    "the description within a first - order perturbation treatment can be applied in the case of the site - impurity .",
    "the bond - impurity is irrelevant for repulsive interaction , and leads to a strong suppression of quantum coherence  but not to a localized ground - state for attractive interaction near the first - order transition .",

    "the numerical results show that dimerization and any kind of impurity weaken each other .",
    "a single barrier in a dimerized chain leads to an enhancement of the delocalized region compared to the clean dimerized system .",

    "<S> using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , we study the quantum coherence in one - dimensional disordered spin chains and fermi systems . we consider in detail spinless fermions on a ring , and compare the influence of several kinds of impurities in a gapless and a dimerized , gapped system . in the translation - invariant system </S>",
    "<S> a so - called site - impurity , which can be realized by a local potential or a modification of one link , increases for repulsive interaction , and decreases for attractive interaction , upon renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> the weakening of two neighbouring bonds , which is a realization of a so - called bond - impurity , on the other hand , is healed for repulsive interaction , but enhanced for intermediate attractive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a strong suppression of the quantum coherence measured by the phase sensitivity , but not to localization . adding a local distortion to a dimerized system , we find that even the presence of a single site - impurity increases the metallic region found in the dimerized model . for a strong dimerization and a high barrier , an additional sharp maximum , </S>",
    "<S> is seen in the phase sensitivity as a function of interaction , already for systems with about 100 sites . </S>",
    "<S> a bond - impurity in the dimerized system also opens a small metallic window in the otherwise isolating regime . </S>"
