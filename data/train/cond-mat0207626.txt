    "left - handed materials ( lhms )  @xcite with negative magnetic permeability @xmath1 and dielectric permittivity @xmath0 have recently attracted a great deal of attention because of their promise for developing novel lenses and low reflectance surfaces  @xcite .",
    "lhms have a negative refractive index , which implies that the phase and group velocities of the propagating electromagnetic wave oppose each other .",
    "this property of lhms is responsible for their anomalous physical behavior : reversed sign of the doppler effect and counter - intuitive refraction at the interface with the  normal  ( right - handed ) media  @xcite .    since materials with negative refraction index",
    "do not naturally occur , they have to be artificially constructed .",
    "an lhm in the microwave frequency band was recently constructed as an array consisting of metal rods and split - ring resonators  @xcite .",
    "using the same strategy for designing lhms at much shorter wavelengths ( e.  g. , in the infrared part of the spectrum ) may prove challenging . here",
    "i describe a new idea of making a lhm _ photonic _ structure by utilizing surface waves at the interfaces of dielectrics with opposing signs of @xmath0 .",
    "left - handedness of such structures is due to the existence of the surface waves at the vacuum / dielectric interfaces .",
    "practical implementation of such photonic structures at a micron scale is encouraged by the availability of low - loss dielectrics and semiconductors with negative @xmath0 , including many polar crystals such as sic , litao@xmath2 , lif , and znse .",
    "the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity of these crystals , given by the approximate formula  @xcite @xmath3 is negative for @xmath4 .",
    "note that @xmath5 reduces to that of the free electron gas for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in section  [ sec : single_waveguide ] i review the properties of surface waves in a single waveguide ( sw ) with @xmath8 cladding shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_structures](a ) , derive the effective dielectric permittivity @xmath9 and magnetic permeability @xmath10 , and demonstrate that the phase and group velocities of the surface waves can oppose each other .",
    "waveguide with silicon carbide ( sic ) cladding is used as an example of a medium which supports left - handed surface phonons .    in section  [ sec : triang_lattice ] the triangular lattice photonic waveguide ( tlpw ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_structures](b ) is found to be a perfectly isotropic lhm for small wavenumbers @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lattice periodicity .",
    "the triangular cladding regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_structures](b ) are assumed to have @xmath13 with the frequency dependence of a free electron gas . in this example ,",
    "vacuum / cladding interfaces support left - handed surface plasmons .",
    "recently  @xcite , it has been suggested that the group velocity in lhms is not aligned with the phase velocity , making the perfect lens  @xcite impossible .",
    "i demonstrate that this is not the case even for an artificially constructed lhm such as the tlpw .",
    "to illustrate how a negative @xmath1 can be mimicked in a single waveguide , consider electromagnetic wave propagation in the horizontal ( @xmath14 ) direction assuming a piecewise constant dielectric constant : @xmath15 in the vacuum channel ( for @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 inside the cladding ( for @xmath18 ) .",
    "the goal is to explain how the energy can flow in the negative @xmath19direction ( and so @xmath20 ) whereas the phase velocity @xmath21 .",
    "consider a confined transverse magnetic ( tm ) wave with non - vanishing components @xmath22 such that @xmath23 at midplane @xmath24 .",
    "since we are interested in the wave propagation along @xmath14 , introduce integrated over the transverse direction @xmath25 quantities @xmath26 from faraday s and ampere s laws , assuming that @xmath27 and integrating by parts , obtain , correspondingly , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where the effective dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the waveguide are defined as follows : @xmath30    the definition of the weight - averaged @xmath0 is intuitive , and @xmath10 is defined so as to eliminate the longitudinal component of the electric field @xmath31 which does not contribute to the power flow along the waveguide . for @xmath32 note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are , on average , out of phase if @xmath35 , making the wave left - handed .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 and @xmath10 must be of the same sign for a propagating wave . the propagating mode is left - handed if @xmath37 , necessitating that the dielectric constant of the cladding be negative .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are calculated by solving the eigenvalue equation for @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 . as an example , consider silicon carbide ( sic ) cladding with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "sic has a stopband ( region of negative @xmath0 ) in the far infrared , @xmath44 m . the dispersion relation and the corresponding @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dchannel](a , b ) for a sw with the vacuum gap width @xmath45 .",
    "the propagating surface mode in a sw exhibits left - handedness : it s group velocity @xmath46 is negative , and so are @xmath35 and @xmath47 .",
    "the cutoff at @xmath48 is caused by the vanishing of the @xmath10 .",
    "why is @xmath49 despite @xmath50 ?",
    "the total poynting flux @xmath51 along the dielectric waveguide is the sum of the fluxes inside the cladding and in the vacuum gap . in the gap ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath38 are in phase , so @xmath52 . inside",
    "the cladding @xmath33 reverses its sign across the vacuum / cladding interface because @xmath8 ( continuity of @xmath53 ) . because @xmath38 is continuous across the interface , @xmath54 in the cladding . for a narrow gap ,",
    "the integrated poynting flux is negative .",
    "note that not any surface wave is left - handed . achieving left - handedness",
    "requires that ( a ) the frequency of the mode lie within the stopband of the cladding , ( b ) there are two interfaces , and ( c ) the vacuum gap between the interfaces is small . in the case of sic cladding ,",
    "the left - handed waves are surface phonons .",
    "the single waveguide example was used to explain the emergence of left - handedness of the surface waves , and to derive the necessary conditions ( a - c ) for their existence .",
    "the objective of this paper is to construct an isotropic photonic medium capable of transmitting left - handed waves in all directions .",
    "this is accomplished by constructing a triangular lattice photonic waveguide ( tlpw ) which consists of the triangular pieces of dielectric cladding arranged in a triangular lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_structures](b ) .",
    "we assume that the dielectric permittivity of the cladding is the same as that of a free electron gas : @xmath55 .",
    "every propagating wave in the tlpw is characterized by its wavenumber @xmath56 , and can be represented as @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 is periodic on the boundaries of the elementary cell of the triangular lattice shown as an equilateral parallelogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : triang_band ] . for each value of @xmath59 eq .",
    "( [ eq : by1 ] ) is solved for its eigenvalues using a commercial finite elements code femlab  @xcite , yielding the dispersion relation @xmath60 v.  s.  @xmath59 .",
    "the local @xmath61 and cell - averaged @xmath62 poynting fluxes are computed for each solution .",
    "simulations results indicate that tlpw is perfectly isotropic for small @xmath63 well inside the brillouin zone .",
    "the elementary cell of the tlpw and the dispersion relation @xmath60 v.  s.  @xmath63 for two orthogonal directions of @xmath64 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triang_band ] .",
    "the two dispersion curves , which are identical for @xmath65 ( establishing the isotropy ) , are drawn to the respective edges of the brillouin zone : @xmath66 and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "these two directions are chosen because they exhibit the maximum possible anisotropy .",
    "indeed , for @xmath68 there exists a vacuum / cladding interface along which the electromagnetic energy can flow in @xmath19direction , fig .  [",
    "fig : flow_kxky](b ) .",
    "no such interface exists for @xmath69 , fig .",
    "[ fig : flow_kxky](a ) . thus , the local poynting flux patterns are very different for these two directions , as can be seen by comparing figs .  [",
    "fig : flow_kxky](a , b ) . for the parameters of fig .",
    "( [ fig : flow_kxky ] ) , @xmath70 , the index of refraction is @xmath71 .",
    "index of refraction can be readily tuned in both directions by adjusting the parameters of the tlpw : periodicity @xmath12 and channel width @xmath72 .    despite the differences in the flow patterns , the cell - integrated fluxes @xmath73 are identical for all directions of @xmath63 , and",
    "so are the frequencies : @xmath74 .",
    "numerical results unambiguously confirm that , for small @xmath75 , phase and group velocities exactly oppose each other .",
    "at least for this particular lhm , the claim of valanju  _ et .",
    "@xcite that @xmath76 is not confirmed .",
    "anisotropy for large @xmath75 is merely the consequence of the periodicity of the photonic structure .    in conclusion , it was demonstrated that surface waves ( phonons or plasmons ) at the interface of dielectrics with opposing signs of the dielectric permittivity @xmath0 can be left - handed .",
    "an isotropic composite medium which has a negative refraction index with respect to such waves can be constructed as a photonic structure .",
