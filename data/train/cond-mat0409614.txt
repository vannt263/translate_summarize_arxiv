    "recent years have seen an increasing interest in the spin properties of nanostructures @xcite .",
    "manipulation and readout of spins in solids could open the way to the development of a generation of electronic devices such as spin transistors , spin filters , and spin memory devices .",
    "in addition , the spin of an electron confined to a quantum dot ( qd ) is a promising candidate for a quantum bit @xcite .",
    "owing to the zero dimensionality of qds , the electronic orbital states are quantized and the electron spin states are very stable due to a substantial suppression of spin - flip mechanisms @xcite .",
    "progress in nanotechnology has allowed the fabrication of qds with desirable electronic and spin properties @xcite .",
    "however , only recently it has been possible to measure the spin of an electron in a qd .",
    "a single electron spin has been detected by magnetic resonance force microscopy @xcite and the readout of an individual electron spin in a qd via pulsed relaxation measurements @xcite and optical orientation experiments @xcite have been reported . in these experiments ,",
    "an external magnetic field was used to distinguish spin - up and spin - down states split by the zeeman energy .",
    "spin relaxation measurements between zeeman levels in a qd @xcite confirm the theoretical predictions that spin - flip relaxation in a qd is suppressed with respect to a bulk structure @xcite .",
    "indeed , very long single - spin relaxation times have been observed : up to @xmath0ms in two - dimensional ( 2d ) gaas qds @xcite , and up to @xmath1ms in self - assembled gainas qds @xcite .",
    "the spin relaxation is expected to be dominated by hyperfine interactions with the nuclei at magnetic fields below @xmath2 t @xcite and by spin - orbit ( so ) interactions for magnetic fields of about @xmath3tesla ( see ref .  ) and for higher magnetic fields ( see ref .  ) . in general , the so interaction consists of two distinct contributions : the dresselhaus so coupling @xcite which is due to bulk inversion asymmetry of the lattice and the rashba so coupling @xcite which is due to structure inversion asymmetry along the growth direction .",
    "both of these so terms result in the splitting of electron energy levels and in the mixing of the electron spin states .",
    "the latter makes spin - flip relaxation between zeeman levels possible , for example , due to the phonon scattering .",
    "note that usually it is not simple to separate these two so mechanisms and estimate the relative contributions of each so term . in experiments , to obtain information about one of the so couplings , normally the other is neglected @xcite .",
    "this leads to a lack of precision in estimates of the so coupling strength and to a neglect of the effects of the interplay of the rashba and the dresselhaus so couplings @xcite .",
    "hence , it is very important to find a way to separate these so mechanisms , to increase our understanding of the so relaxation processes , and to improve predictions of the spin properties of nanostructures .",
    "it is well known @xcite that for 2d quantum wells the different so couplings can be distinguished experimentally @xcite via detection of the associated anisotropy of the spin splitting in the conduction band .",
    "in contrast , such a detection is not possible in qds since the spin splitting of the levels , being quadratically in the so coupling , is isotropic .",
    "still , as we point out now , the so couplings in qds can be distinguished via their associated spin relaxation rates since they strongly differ due to different level mixing properties .    in this paper , the electron energy spectrum and the spin relaxation for a 2d qd in magnetic fields perpendicular to the qd surface are studied .",
    "level anticrossing @xcite ( due to the so coupling ) , at a point of accidental level degeneracy ( due to the interplay between the orbital and magnetic confinement ) , is analytically investigated .",
    "this anticrossing is caused by the rashba so term only , leading to a cusp structure in the magnetic - field dependence of the spin relaxation rate , whereas the spin relaxation rate due to the dresselhaus so coupling is a monotonic function of magnetic field in this region .",
    "this qualitative difference in the spin relaxation for different so couplings can serve to extract the different contributions in so coupling .",
    "we consider a 2d isotropic qd with parabolic lateral confinement potential .",
    "an external magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the surface of the qd .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the vector potential in the symmetric gauge , @xmath7 is the characteristic confinement frequency , and @xmath8 is the vector of the pauli matrices .    the so interaction is taken into account by adding the linear dresselhaus @xcite and rashba @xcite terms for conduction band electrons in a [ 001 ] two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , @xmath9 the axes @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are aligned along the principal crystallographic axes of gaas .    it is convenient to introduce new phase coordinates ( @xmath13 ) which connected to the previous ones ( @xmath14 ) by the following formula @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency . in the new phase",
    "coordinates , @xmath18 has the canonical form @xmath19 in this case , @xmath18 can be considered as the hamiltonian of two independent harmonic oscillators with hybrid frequencies @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum and eigenstates of electrons in a qd without the so coupling are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the electron - spin projection on the @xmath12-axis , @xmath24 is the zeeman frequency , and @xmath25 are oscillator functions .",
    "let us consider the three lowest levels : @xmath26 the first level is the ground state .",
    "in the case of weak magnetic confinement ( @xmath27 ) , the second level is lower than the third one ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , at high magnetic fields , when the magnetic confinement is much stronger than the lateral confinement ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 , because @xmath31 . the condition for a crossing of the levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , this level crossing takes place when the magnetic length @xmath35 is equal to @xmath36^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath37 is the characteristic lateral size of a qd and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the level crossing occurs at accessible magnetic fields for qds with lateral size @xmath39 nm .",
    "now we take so coupling into account and find the energy spectrum and eigenstates of electrons in a qd . for a gaas",
    "qd the so lengths are @xmath40 m @xcite and are much larger than the hybrid orbital length @xmath41 of a qd ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , the so terms can be considered as small perturbations .",
    "first we consider the dresselhaus so coupling [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdr ] ) ] .",
    "it is important to note that in first - order perturbation theory there is no so interaction between the levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 due to the dresselhaus term ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "hence we can apply standard perturbation theory for nondegenerate levels .",
    "thus , in first - order perturbation theory , we get @xmath44 , latexmath:[\\ ] ]      99 _ semiconductor spintronics and quantum computing _ , edited by d.d .",
