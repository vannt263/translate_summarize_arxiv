    "an important limitation of the theoretical accuracy of these bounds is in fact due to the rescattering effects mentioned above @xcite@xcite .",
    "a closer look shows , however , that these effects do not spoil the bounds on @xmath1 , and can be included completely , in a rather straightforward way , through the decay @xmath0 and its charge conjugate , providing in addition valuable insights into final - state interactions @xcite .",
    "the combined branching ratio br@xmath7 for this decay , which is defined in analogy to ( [ br - neut ] ) and ( [ br - char ] ) , is very sensitive to rescattering processes and may be enhanced considerably through them .    in this paper",
    ", we illustrate these interesting features in more detail by following closely @xcite and using the parametrization of the @xmath10 and @xmath17 decay amplitudes in terms of the `` physical '' quantities given there .",
    "the outline is as follows : in section  [ sec : obs ] , we collect the expressions for the @xmath8 decay amplitudes , introduce the relevant observables , and discuss briefly the constraints on the ckm angle @xmath1 implied by them . in section  [ sec : fsicontrol ] , we focus on the approach to take into account rescattering effects in these bounds with the help of @xmath6 . this strategy , as well as the realization of the constraints on @xmath1 , is illustrated in a quantitative way in section  [ sec : model ] , where we will use a simple model to describe the rescattering effects that has been proposed in @xcite and is based on the assumption of elastic final - state interactions . in section  [ sec : sum ] , a few concluding remarks are given .",
    "the general @xmath10 and @xmath17 decay amplitudes arising within the framework of the standard model can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath18\\label{ampl - char}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to derive these amplitude relations , the @xmath19 isospin symmetry of strong has been used . the amplitude @xmath20 , which is usually referred to as a `` penguin '' amplitude , takes the form @xmath21{\\cal p}_{tc}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath22.\\ ] ] here the quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe contributions originating from penguin topologies with internal top and charm , and up and charm quarks , respectively , @xmath25 is due to annihilation processes , and @xmath26 are the relevant ckm factors , expressed in terms of the wolfenstein parameters @xcite .",

    ", @xmath27 is usually referred to as a `` tree '' amplitude .",
    "this terminology is , however , misleading in this case , since @xmath27 actually receives not only `` tree '' contributions , but also contributions from penguin and annihilation topologies , as was pointed out in @xcite .    in order to obtain information on the ckm angle @xmath1 , in addition to the ratio @xmath16 of the combined @xmath8 branching ratios introduced in ( [ def - r ] ) , the `` pseudo - asymmetry '' @xmath41 as well as the quantities @xmath42 where @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 are differences of the relevant strong phases , turn out to be very useful @xcite .",
    "the general expressions for @xmath16 and @xmath46 in terms of the parameters specified in ( [ r - eps - def ] ) and ( [ phases - def ] ) are quite complicated and are given explicitly in @xcite , where further details can be found .",
    "let us here just briefly discuss the basic ideas that are at the basis of the constraints on the ckm angle @xmath1 arising from these observables .",
    "the pseudo - asymmetry @xmath46 allows us to eliminate the strong phase @xmath47 in the expression for @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , if both @xmath16 and @xmath46 have been measured , contours in the @xmath1@xmath48 plane can be fixed . if the parameter @xmath48 , i.e.  @xmath38 , could also be fixed , we were in a position to extract the value of @xmath1 from these contours up to a four - fold ambiguity @xcite . unfortunately , since @xmath27 is not just a `` tree '' amplitude , @xmath48 may in general receive sizeable non - factorizable contributions",
    ". therefore , expectations relying on `` factorization '' that a future theoretical accuracy of @xmath48 as small as @xmath11 may be achievable ( see , for instance , @xcite ) appear too optimistic .",

    "although it has been claimed by several authors in recent literature that such rescattering processes would invalidate the constraints on the ckm angle @xmath1 implied by the @xmath62 , @xmath2 observables , this is actually not the case @xcite .",
    "these effects can be included in the bounds on @xmath1 by using additional experimental data .",
    "the purpose of this section is to give a detailed discussion of this important feature , which will be illustrated in a quantitative way in the following section .",
    "a first step towards the control of rescattering processes is provided by the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath63 while simple quark - level estimates give at most a few percent for this cp asymmetry  @xcite , rescattering processes may lead to values as large as @xmath11 @xcite@xcite . as soon as @xmath64 has been measured , we are in a position to obtain upper and lower bounds on @xmath55 , which are given by @xmath65 in particular the lower bound @xmath66 is of special interest . a detailed study can be found in @xcite . in order to go beyond these constraints , the decay @xmath0 and its charge conjugate  the @xmath67 counterparts of @xmath2  play a key role .",
