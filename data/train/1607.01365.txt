    "is reduced to unity by adopting a proper set of distance units . the introduction of a non circular perturbation to the circular potential results in the breaking of the circle with the consequence that the central point has now a finite number of images in the vicinity of the circle . in practice",
    "the source itself is not reduced to a point but has a finite size which is of the order of the potential perturbation .",
    "additionally the source may not be exactly at the center of the circular potential and as a consequence has an impact parameter which is also of the order of the potential perturbation which we call @xmath0 , with @xmath1 . using polar coordinates ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) in the lens plane",

    "a useful approximation is to consider thin arcs , assuming that the size of the source is of second order , the first order expansion is reduced to @xmath25 . as a consequence for thin arcs",

    "this degeneracy is difficult since it would require information at sufficient radial distance for the same angular position @xmath3 which is very hard to find in practice .",

    "additionally it is interesting to note that larger sources can always be de - composed in a number of thinner sources for which the thin source approximation is valid .",
