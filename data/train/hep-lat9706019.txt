    "there is an ongoing effort to find improved lattice actions for asymptotically free theories like qcd that are nearly free of lattice artifacts by the means of renormalization group theory @xcite .",
    "the conceptual basics have been developed by hasenfratz and niedermayer for the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model @xcite .",
    "a good description of the basic ideas of improved lattice actions can be found in @xcite . while using the renormalization group transformation ( rgt ) to get improved actions , it is important to understand the basic convergence properties of the transformation in the vicinity of the fixed point . in the standard way of thinking ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the rg transformation can be determined by dimensional analysis . however , general rg transformations result in additional non - canonical eigenvalues . in this paper",
    "we give an insight how this mechanism works . here",
    "we consider free fermionic field theories although the statements are more general .",
    "the standard terminology is the following : for fermions , when we transform a fine lattice to a coarse one , we have @xmath2 } = \\int{\\cal d}\\bar{\\psi}\\,{\\cal    d}\\psi\\ , e^{-s[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi ] -    t[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi;\\bar{\\psi}^\\prime,\\psi^\\prime ] } \\label{blocktrafo}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fermion fields on the fine and coarse lattice and @xmath5 defines the renormalization group or block transformation that does the averaging . in principle , there are no restrictions to @xmath5 .",
    "but we want to choose an averaging that matches our intuitive picture of the renormalization group transformation .",
    "that means that we do not want @xmath5 to average over too much or too few sites on the fine lattice , just enough to account for the space between the coarse lattice points .",
    "it turns out that the interaction range of the fp action depends significantly on the actual choice of @xmath5 .",
    "apart from these qualitative restrictions , one of the constraints that applies to @xmath5 is that the generating functional @xmath6 ( and thus the free energy and thermodynamics ) should not change : @xmath7\\right\\ } \\quad = \\ ; \\int{\\cal d}\\bar{\\psi}^\\prime\\,{\\cal d}\\psi^\\prime\\ , \\exp\\left\\{-s^\\prime[\\bar{\\psi}^\\prime,\\psi^\\prime]\\right\\}\\ ] ] the long - distance properties are thus untouched .",
    "the correlation length measured in lattice spacings ( the dimensionless counterpart of the physical correlation length ; @xmath8 ) is changed to @xmath9 since the lattice spacing is changed @xmath10 and thus @xmath11 . in this work",
    "we only use transformations with @xmath12 .",
    "the action @xmath13 $ ] is most generally a sum of all kinds of interaction terms even if @xmath14 $ ] had a simple form . if we set the initial @xmath15 to the general form @xmath16 = -\\sum_i c_i x_i[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi ] \\label{generics}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the couplings of the different interactions @xmath18 $ ] ( @xmath19 is just a labeling index ) .",
    "the interactions may be of any form conformal to lattice symmetries . these can be higher derivatives and higher powers of the fields @xmath3 .",
    "the couplings @xmath17 form a coupling space .",
    "an rg transformation is moving the action in this space , and for very special sets of couplings @xmath20 the rg reproduces the same couplings  we have a fixed point fp of the rgt . in such fps",
    "we have collective behavior over infinite many lattice sites . in the vicinity of the fp - set of couplings @xmath21 the function @xmath22",
    "is given by @xmath23 so because @xmath24 is a fp , @xmath25 we have @xmath26 where the @xmath27 denotes the difference of the point @xmath28 to @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure that follows is the usual one for a linearized symmetry : we try to identify its eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "denote the eigenvalues with @xmath29 and the eigenvectors with @xmath30 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath30 are some linear combinations of the operators @xmath31 .",
    "the neighborhood of the fp can be then expressed as @xmath16 = s^\\ast[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi ] + \\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha\\sigma_\\alpha[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]\\label{fixpointneighborhood}\\ ] ] performing one rg step we get @xmath32 = s^\\ast[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi ] + \\sum_\\alpha e_\\alpha d_\\alpha\\sigma_\\alpha[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi ] \\label{nearfp}\\ ] ] if we continue to apply the blocking step to this action , we will get an additional factor @xmath29 for each step .",
    "of course this action will only converge towards @xmath33 if every eigenvalue @xmath29 in the sum is smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "eigenvectors with such eigenvalues are called irrelevant . the most general action @xmath15 will have of course eigenvector - components with ( relevant ) eigenvalues larger than @xmath34 and thus the repeated application of the rg transformation will bring the system away from the fp . in order to converge to the fp , the coefficients @xmath35 have to be set to zero for every relevant eigenvector @xmath30 .      for the gaussian fixed point",
    ", one can give the form of the eigenoperators and eigenvalues explicitly for specific rg transformations .",
    "the eigenvalues are depending of the engineering dimensions of the operators involved .",
    "they are all some exponent of @xmath36 : we have @xmath37    if we have some general rg transformation , one would think that the eigenvalues should be reproduced , and that specifically there is no eigenoperator with an eigenvalue @xmath38 because it is impossible to write a regular operator with such an engineering dimension .",
    "what we are seeing in the calculations , however , is that we do measure such eigenvalues .",
    "these eigenoperators with an eigenvalue between @xmath39 and @xmath34 are interpreted as redundant directions in the critical surface , i.e.  connecting lines between possible fp actions .",
    "that s why these eigenvalues have no physical significance . to be specific",
    ", we move on such a direction from a fp1 of a rg transformation ( rg1 ) , to fp2 of some other rg transformation ( rg2 ) which is very similar to rg1 .",
    "the difference between one transformation and the other one is giving the redundant operator and the eigenvalue may be in principle any number .",
    "if we are in the fp1 of rg1 and now apply rg2 , we are moving towards fp2 with such a redundant eigenvalue .",
    "if this eigenvalue is smaller than @xmath34 , we will eventually end up in fp2 .",
    "if this eigenvalue is greater or equal @xmath34 , this means that we can not move from fp1 to fp2 since fp1 does not lie in the attracting region of fp2 .",
    "in particular , if the eigenvalue is exactly @xmath34 , then the points on the line between fp1 and fp2 will not move under rg1 or rg2 at all  the fps of these transformations are not unique",
    ". this fact does not matter for continuum physics , because every point on the connecting line leads to an action which is describing the same theory .",
    "operators belonging to such directions are redundant , their presence in the action does not influence the lattice artifacts .",
    "those are only influenced by the irrelevant operators .      consider some lattice regularization of the maselss free fermionic theory : @xmath40 & = & \\sum_{q}\\bar{\\psi}(q)\\,\\delta(q)\\,\\psi(-q)\\label{sdef1}\\\\ \\delta(q ) & = & \\rho_\\mu(q)\\gamma_\\mu + \\lambda(q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] usually , @xmath5 is written as @xmath41\\ ; = \\ ; \\hspace*{10cm}\\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa\\,\\sum_{n_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\!\\ ! b}}\\left(\\bar{\\psi}^\\prime(n_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\!\\ !",

    "this expression is very convenient for iterative purposes .",
    "the iteration can be carried out for the inverse of the action kernel ( i.e.  the propagator ) .",
    "since @xmath51 has a simple matrix structure ( [ sdef1 ] ) the inversion @xmath52 to get the propagator is easy and the recursion straightforward , giving the same matrix structure @xmath53 .",
    "having found a recursion relation for the propagator @xmath54 , we can invert it back to get the new action kernel",
    ". then we can iterate the action @xmath15 to obtain the fixed point action @xmath33 .",

    "we see that @xmath69 is the one and only relevant parameter of the rg transformation for the free fermion field : it is the only quantity that is doubled with each step .",
    "the only value of @xmath69 which can lead to a fixed point is therefore @xmath70 .",
    "this fixes the so - called critical surface for the parameters of the free fermion action . in the infinity limit",
    "we get finally the fp quantities @xmath71 where @xmath72 for the sake of convergence , we have the ( weak ) conditions on the blocking function @xmath73 that the infinite sum @xmath74 and the infinite product @xmath75 must be finite functions of @xmath48 and that the summation over @xmath76 is also leading to a finite value . as an additional constraint",
    ", we have the normalization condition @xmath77 .",
    "the summation over @xmath76 in ( [ fpalpha ] ) is now over all positive and negative numbers because due to periodicity ( @xmath78 ) the summation @xmath79 in ( [ alphak ] ) may be rewritten to @xmath80 .",
    "this form is more convenient in the @xmath81 limit because terms with @xmath82 are equally important .",
    "a fixed point exists if the infinite sums in ( [ fpalpha],[fpbeta ] ) converge .",
    "the number @xmath83 has not been fixed by convergence considerations in the above section .",
    "so the given rg transformation may be parametrized by @xmath83 .",
    "decimation is the crudest method of blocking the lattice .",
    "it consists of simply keeping only one site in a block and integrating out the rest : @xmath84}=\\int{\\cal    d}\\bar{\\psi}\\,{\\cal d}\\psi\\prod_{n_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\!\\ !",

    "( [ blocktrafo],[tdef ] ) this corresponds to @xmath85 and @xmath86 we have to check if this crude transformation meets our conditions for the fp to exist . in one dimension",
    "we find that there is a fixed point of the rg transformation and we can give the explicit form of the fp .",
    "starting from equations ( [ alphak],[betak ] ) with @xmath87 and @xmath88 we get @xmath89 and @xmath90 so that the action is given by the functions @xmath91 this action is the result of a sequence of infinitely many rg steps , so it describes the continuum as any other fp action .",
    "there is one peculiarity that needs attention .",
    "the fp has an explicit dependence on the wilson parameter @xmath66 .",
    "so there are different fps for different starting actions . as a consequence ,",
    "the parameter @xmath66 must parametrize fps lying on a redundant direction with eigenvalue @xmath34 , as discussed in section [ redundantoperators ] .",
    "this rg transformation gives a line of fps , so it can not move from one fp to another of this line ",
    "each fp will block into itself .",
    "the explicit dependence on a free parameter should thus not bother us , it is just another parameter that may be tuned for other properties of the action .",
    "we have stated above that the fp is only depending on the exact form of the rg transformation as a consequence of the basic hypothesis that the long ranged interactions are independent of the exact form of the short - ranged fluctuations .",
    "that the fp depends on another free parameter is only stating that we may end up in different fps for the same transformation .",
    "this case may be regarded as a limiting case to where no fp exists ( the rg transformation diverges ) .",
    "for @xmath92 the decimation - fp action is just the wilson - fermion action .",
    "unfortunately in one dimensions we have no spectrum @xmath93 so we can not check for the only physical quantity in the free system .",
    "decimation is not a good rgt because it represents the fine lattice action _ too _",
    "well  the correlation functions on the coarse and fine lattice are identical .",
    "so even after an arbitrary high number of rg steps the action on the final coarse lattice will depend on the microscopic details of the starting action , it does not ` forget ' anything .",
    "this is of course not what we want .",
    "an rgt should average out the microscopic details in order to concentrate on the long - range behaviour .",
    "decimation simply copies everything to a larger lattice .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the fp formula ( [ fpalpha ] , [ fpbeta ] ) diverges  there is too much to keep .",
    "the fp with an explicit dependence on a parameter is not a speciality for one dimension , we could also give a block transformation which has a fixed point with an explicit @xmath66-dependence in two or more dimensions .",
    "as opposed to decimation , the blocking procedure presented by kadanoff takes all sites of the fine lattice into account .",
    "their weight is equal within the block .",
    "the procedure is simple : always block @xmath94 points together by building their average : @xmath95 where @xmath96 are vectors pointing to the corners of the unit cube ; their components @xmath97 are either 1 or 0 .    for this simple case , it is possible to calculate @xmath98 and @xmath99 explicitly @xcite . from ( [ bigomega ] )",
    "we have @xmath100 using this in the definition of @xmath101 in ( [ defomegahat ] ) we see that the sum over @xmath76 gives just 1 for all n as a special property of this blocking .",
    "this leaves us with a geometrical series for @xmath39 giving for @xmath81 @xmath102 the expression for @xmath103 in the @xmath81 limit is very simple : @xmath104    this result was already presented in @xcite . in this case",
    "the fp action may be given even analytically .",
    "a more general blocking procedure is to average not just every distinct unit cube as in the kadanoff - blocking but to build the weighted average of the fine points surrounding the blocked lattice site .",
    "this way we may also consider blockings somewhere between decimation and the kadanoff - style flat blocking .",
    "explicitly , we can write for @xmath49 dimensions    @xmath105    the constants @xmath17 may be chosen freely ( except that @xmath43 must be fulfilled ) .",
    "now the blocking overlaps , i.e.  a fine lattice point contributes to more than one point on the new blocked lattice ( figure [ fig : rotsymblock ] ) . in momentum space ,",
    "the blocking function is given by @xmath106 we require the constants @xmath17 to be positive since we do not want to have points with a negative weight : @xmath107 general simplifications concerning @xmath74 and @xmath75 only exist for very specific @xmath17 values .",
    "if we choose the blocking to be ` flat ' , i.e.  the overall weight of the points to be equal , we get very short - ranged action and a fast convergence which is most welcome in the procedure of constructing a fp action numerically . for this flat blocking the numbers @xmath17",
    "are given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "then , similarly to the kadanoff blocking , we find in momentum space by simplifying ( [ overlapomega ] ) @xmath110 which is identical to ( [ wilsomega ] ) up to the exponent . also the fp functions may be given explicitly .",
