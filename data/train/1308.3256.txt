    "in the last decades , heavy fermion systems and intermediate valence compounds have attracted considerable attention because of their fundamental importance in modern solid state physics @xcite .",
    "different ingredients contribute to the complexity of these fascinating systems : the presence of strong kondo interactions , the level structure originated in crystal - field effects ( cfe ) including different hybridization strengths with the conduction band , and possible coherence effects introduced by the periodicity of the lattice and intersite magnetic interactions .    usually above a certain coherence temperature , several ce @xcite and yb @xcite compounds for example ,",
    "can be described by an impurity anderson model or the impurity kondo model , which is the integer - valent limit of the former when the magnetic configuration dominates .",
    "these systems behave as conventional fermi liquids @xcite , although with a very large effective mass @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "other systems display non - fermi - liquid behavior @xcite , but they are outside the scope of this work .    the impurity anderson model and several variants of it , have been solved exactly using the bethe ansatz technique @xcite .",
    "desgranges and schotte have calculated the specific heat for the spin 1/2 kondo model solving numerically the resulting system of integral equations @xcite .",
    "exact results in presence of crystal field have been reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , desgranges and schotte calculated the specific heat of a system of two doublets @xcite .",
    "a limitation of these exact solutions when cfe are present is that the hybridization of different multiplets are considered to be the same , which usually is not the case in real systems .",
    "another drawback is that to calculate thermodynamic quantities , the bethe ansatz leads to a set of integral equations , which should be solved numerically , rendering very difficult to use the exact solutions as a tool to fit experimental data .",
    "the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) is a very accurate numerical technique which has the advantage over the bethe ansatz that there are no restriction for the impurity hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "for example an anderson model that mixes a doublet with either a singlet or o triplet can be exactly solved @xcite , but not when both , singlet and triplet are present , while the nrg can treat the complete model and describe the quantum phase transition between singlet and doublet ground states @xcite . however , the calculations are numerically demanding . to the best of our knowledge",
    "neither exact results nor nrg has been used to fit experimental results in which non - trivial cfe are present .",
    "recent increase of the available experimental data of physical properties at intermediate temperature ( @xmath5k ) on intermetallic compounds , renders necessary the analysis of experimental data with the inclusion of cfe .    in absence of crystal field ,",
    "k. d. schotte and u. schotte proposed a simplified approach based on the resonant level model to interpret experiments of spin 1/2 kondo systems in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the theory assumes a linear increase of the slitting of the peaks with magnetic field , which is only approximately true according to bethe - ansatz results @xcite . in spite of this fact",
    ", the authors were able to fit the magnetization of fe impurities in ag as a function of magnetic field , and the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature very accurately @xcite .",
    "for the specific heat , the comparison between this approach with exact solutions shows an excellent agreement @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the approach to include cfe , and apply the results to interpret the specific heat of several ce and yb compounds , for which one expects that single impurity behavior in the kondo limit ( oxidation state near ce@xmath6 or yb@xmath6 ) and fermi - liquid physics applies down to low temperatures .",
    "the approximations are described in section 2 .",
    "the resulting approximate analytical results are compared with available exact results in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we apply our approach to four ce ( cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 , cepd@xmath1si@xmath2 , cepdal and cept ) and two yb ( yb@xmath0pd@xmath0sn and ybco@xmath0zn@xmath3 ) . compounds .",
    "we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "we start from a generalization of the approach proposed by schotte and schotte @xcite to the case of two doublets split by a crystal field @xmath7 or , alternatively , a quadruplet with different @xmath8 factors , in both cases with the possible application of a magnetic field .",
    "specifically we postulate the following simplified form of the free energy for two doublets @xmath9 \\ln \\left ( { { e}^{\\frac{\\omega } { 2{{k}_{b}}t}}}+{{e}^{-\\frac{\\omega } { 2{{k}_{b}}t}}}\\right ) , }   \\label{f2d}\\]]where @xmath10 represents the half width at half maximum of the spectral density for the doublet @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a small shift that can be disregarded for the moment , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the zeeman magnetic splitting of the doublet ground state by the magnetic field @xmath16 .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath17 is proportional to the width of the ground - state doublet , @xmath18 , as explained in detail in the next section .",
    "note that in absence of hybridization effects ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , except for an irrelevant additive constant , @xmath20 reduces to    @xmath21    which corresponds to the free energy of two doublets separated by an energy @xmath7 , both split by a magnetic field in the same fashion .",
    "although the latter fact is not realistic , for usual cases in which @xmath22 , the individual levels of the excited doublet have a similar population for all temperatures and their magnetic splitting becomes irrelevant .",
    "the same situation occurs for @xmath23 .",
    "thus we expect that eq .",
    "( [ f2d ] ) is a reasonable approximation in general .",
    "an alternative scenario to which eq .",
    "( [ f2d ] ) can be applied is a quadruplet split by a magnetic field . in that case",
    "the corresponding energies are @xmath24 and @xmath25 and one should consider @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ f2d ] ) with a cutoff @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the gamma function @xmath30 : @xmath31    in practice , we find that for small bare splitting @xmath7 , it is convenient to increase the position of both doublets by a shift @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "this can be understood as follows . for the su(2 )",
    "model , the approximation of schotte and schotte seems to be inspired by the fact that the electron spectral density has a resonance centered at the fermi energy , in such a way that in the kondo limit , with total electron occupation 1 at the impurity , both spins have occupation 1/2 .",
    "this becomes clear in fermi liquid approaches , in which the resonance near the fermi energy can be accurately described @xcite .",
    "however , when the hybridization between the impurity and conduction electrons is the same for both doublets and @xmath34 , the model has su(4 ) symmetry @xcite , each fermion should have an occupation near 1/4 , and this means that the resonance is displaced above the fermi energy @xcite . for general hybridizations , and zero magnetic field , integrating the spectral densities ( in a similar way as in the slave - boson mean - field approximation @xcite ) , one finds that to enforce a total occupation 1 ( as corresponding to ce and yb impurities in the kondo limit ) in a mean - field approach , the shift @xmath32 should satisfy    @xmath35=1,\\ ] ]    which is equivalent to @xmath36 whre we have used that @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the extension of this heuristic approach to finite magnetic field is beyond the scope of the present work . in any case",
    "the above equation shows that @xmath32 is negligible for large @xmath7 .    in ce compounds , the hund s rules ground state with total angular momentum @xmath39",
    "is split in a quartet and a doublet , or three doublets depending on the point group determined by the symmetry around the ce atom .",
    "therefore , for a comparison with experiment , a third doublet should be included .",
    "note that including a third term between brackets in eq .",
    "( [ f2d ] ) would mean that eight ( not six ) broadened levels are considered ( as it is clear taking all @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore , a straightforward extension of this equation to include three doublets is not possible .",
    "however , if the width of the levels @xmath41 is much smaller than the splitting @xmath42 between the third and the first doublet , we can take at high temperatures the simple schottky expression @xmath43 , which corresponds to all @xmath40 :    @xmath44    a similar reasoning can be followed for more doublets .",
    "this leads to the following proposal to describe the free energy for three doublets , or a quartet ground state and an excited doublet .",
    "@xmath45 for small temperatures @xmath20 dominates , while the remaining two terms become important when @xmath46 reaches values near @xmath42 .",
    "this will become apparent in section [ meas ] .",
    "note that this form ensures the correct limit @xmath47 for the entropy as @xmath48 . for a ground state doublet and an excited quadruplet , @xmath20 and @xmath49",

    "alternative definitions , like for example from the width of the lowest peak in the spectral density @xcite , temperature dependence of transport properties @xcite , or the linear term in the specific heat @xcite give the same result within a factor of the order of 1 , but the leading exponential dependence on the parameters is the same . in the extreme limits in which either no cfe are present , or they are so large that only the ground - state multiplet matters , the kondo temperature is given by the usual expression for an su(n ) kondo model    @xmath64    where n is the degeneracy of the ground state , @xmath29 half the band width , @xmath65 the exchange interaction , and @xmath66 the conduction density of states at the fermi level .    for the case of a quartet split into two doublets ( the su(4 ) @xmath63 su(2 ) model mentioned above ) , using a simple variational function , it has been found that the kondo temperature as a function of the splitting @xmath7 can be written as @xcite    @xmath67    where of course , @xmath68 , and from the above equations @xmath69 .    using the non - crossing approximation , the width of the peak nearest to the fermi energy of the spectral density",

    "presumably this is due to the broadening of the two higher levels , particularly the highest one , which are absent in our approach .",

    "our fit deviates above the experimental results in a narrow range of intermediate temperatures .",
