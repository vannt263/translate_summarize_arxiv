    "oriented percolation was introduced by hammersley @xcite as a model for porous - media , the oriented - character of the model can be seen as an attempt to take into account gravity when considering diffusion of liquid the medium ( as opposed to ordinary percolation which was introduce at the same period ) . its main object is to study connectivity property of an inhomogeneous lattice in a given orientation . in this paper",
    "we do not focus on the most common question for percolation , which is existence of infinite open path , but rather on their abundance .",
    "the main result we have is that if we consider a graph with a density of open edges barely sufficient to create infinite open - path , then the number of open path of a given length starting from the origin is much lower than its expected value .",
    "this implies ( see @xcite ) that diffusion does not occur in the medium .",
    "this contrasts with what happens when there is an high density of edge and the transversal dimension is larger than @xmath19 , in which case , the number of open path is roughly equal to its expected value when percolation occurs .",
    "although we believe that this phenomenon holds with great generality , with the method developed here , we can prove it only for a spread - out version of the model and possibly for very high - dimensional nearest neighbor model .",
    "the proof is based on size biasing argument and path counting .",
    "we consider the following oriented independent edge - percolation model on @xmath0 :    * consider @xmath20 and with finite support and @xmath21 that satisfies @xmath22 * we define @xmath23 , our percolation environment , to be a field of independent bernouilli random variable with parameter @xmath24 ( let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the probability distribution and expectation ) .",
    "* we say that an edge @xmath27 is _ open _ if @xmath28 , and that an oriented path @xmath29 is _ open _ if all the edges @xmath30 are open .",
    "the usual aim of oriented - percolation is to investigate the existence of infinite open paths and their properties , and more generally , the connectivity properties of the oriented - network formed by the open - edges . and also the evolution of these property for fixed @xmath11 when @xmath31 varies . in this paper",
    "we focus more specifically on two cases for the function @xmath11 :    @xmath32    ( where @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) the first case is called nearest neighbor oriented - percolation and is the one that has received the most interest in the physics literature . the second case is called spread - out oriented - percolation with range @xmath35 ( @xmath35 is to be thought as a large integer ) .",
    "spread - out models have been studied by mathematicians for a long time for a technical reason : whereas considering long - range ( but finite ) interactions instead of nearest - neighbor ones should not change the essential properties of a model , a lot of questions becomes easier to solve for these models when the range @xmath35 gets large ( an example of that is the use of long - range model to make the lace expansion work for all dimensions above the critical one , see @xcite ) .",
    "we will study also a generalized version of the spread - out oriented - percolation .",
    "one defines @xmath36 to be the event of percolation from the origin    @xmath37    one defines the percolation threshold by @xmath38    the aim of this paper is to discuss the asymptotics of the number of open path of length @xmath9 starting from the origin when percolation occurs .",

    "an interesting perspective would be get method to compute the above expectation in an effective way ( e.g. combining computer calculus and concentration - like theoretical results ) and and see how the obtained bound compares with conjectured values for @xmath7 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "a challenging issue is to prove that this never happens in low dimension ( say @xmath76 and @xmath103 ) , and that for whatever small edge - dilution , the quenched connectivity constant is strictly smaller than the annealed one . as in the directed case , there are heuristics evidence that this happens in dimension @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but there is a need of a better ( i.e.  rigorous ) understanding the behavior of the self - avoiding walk to transform that into a proof .",
