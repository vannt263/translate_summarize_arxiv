    "in @xcite , kauffman introduces a model for knots presented as flat knotted ribbons and gives constructions of the trefoil and figure eight knots . he defines the ( closed ) _ ribbonlength _ of a knot to be the smallest length to width ratio possible among the ways of forming the knot as a closed loop of ribbon .",
    "truncation presentation _ of a knot is one formed from a length of ribbon such that the ends of the ribbon lie flush with segments in its edges .",
    "the minimum length to width ratio over such truncation presentations is the _",
    "truncation ribbonlength_.    in her master s thesis , demaranville  @xcite showed how to build regular polygons by tying torus knots with ribbon . in the current paper , we summarise some of the constructions of @xcite and use them to bound the ribbonlength of certain torus knots .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that the closed ( respectively , truncation ) ribbonlength of a @xmath0 torus knot is @xmath1 ( resp . , @xmath2 ) .",
    "we illustrate how to construct regular polygons by forming @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 torus knots with ribbons .",
    "in fact , these families include all regular polygons except triangles , squares , and hexagons .",
    "kauffman  @xcite reports that kusner conjectures a linear relationship between ribbonlength and crossing number : @xmath13 using estimates of the ribbonlength for torus knots , we deduce bounds on the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "for truncated knots , we conclude @xmath14 while for closed knots we have @xmath15 . for @xmath6 , we can not improve on the bounds that follow from kauffman s  @xcite study .",
    "the closed trefoil shows @xmath16 while the truncated figure eight knot yields @xmath17 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "after this introduction we devote one section to each of the following families of torus knots : @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath18 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in each case",
    "we determine the length to width ratio of the construction .",
    "together , these families yield all regular @xmath19-gons for @xmath20 as well as the regular pentagon .",
    "next , in section 6 , we refine our estimates of the ribbonlength for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 torus knots and show how the @xmath23 knot ( which is not torus ) can be tied as a rectangle . in the final section",
    "we compile the length to width ratios of the various families of torus knots in order to obtain bounds on the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 of equation  [ eqkusner ] .",
    "in @xcite , kauffman uses the pentagon formed when a trefoil knot ( a @xmath25 torus knot ) is tied with a ribbon to find the ( conjectured ) ribbonlength of that knot .",
    "demaranville  @xcite observed that a @xmath26 torus knot forms a heptagon and , in general , a @xmath0 torus knot yields a @xmath27-gon .",
    "we will use this observation to calculate the ribbonlength of these knots .    to illustrate the geometry of the @xmath24 torus knots , we begin with the truncated @xmath26 torus knot . as in figure  [ fig43 ] ,",
    "torus knot forms a heptagon .",
    "[ fig43 ] ]    when the ribbon is folded to make a regular heptagon , the fold lines segment the ribbon into six congruent isosceles trapezoids . by circumscribing the heptagon , we recognise the top and base of each trapezoid as chords of a circle ( figure  [ fig43circ ] ) .    ]",
    "we will use elementary geometry to find those lengths .    in figure  [ fig43circ ] , @xmath28 is the centre of the circle . since @xmath29 , the remaining angles in the isosceles triangle @xmath30 are each @xmath31 . by the law of sines ,",
    "the length @xmath32 of the base of the trapezoid is related to the radius @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath35 is isosceles , we can find @xmath33 in terms of @xmath36 , the length of the sides of the heptagon : @xmath37 .",

    "demaranville observed that the pattern of pentagon formed by a @xmath25 torus and heptagon by a @xmath26 torus persists .",
    "in general , a @xmath0 torus knot can be tied with ribbon to form a regular @xmath45-gon . the calculation above also generalises .",
    "the ribbon will be segmented into @xmath46 isosceles trapezoids with tops and bottoms of length @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "comparing the length @xmath49 with the width @xmath50 we arrive at our conjectured truncation ribbonlength for a @xmath0 torus knot : @xmath2 .",
    "for the closed knot , we need one additional trapezoid . measuring the length along the centre of the ribbon ,",
    "we conjecture that the closed ribbonlength of a @xmath0 torus knot is @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we investigate @xmath10 torus knots ( @xmath51 , odd ) .",
    "demaranville  @xcite proved that knots in this family also form regular polygons when tied with ribbon ( see figure  [ figp2 ] ) .",
    "torus knot .",
    "[ figp2 ] ]    note that there is a  hole \" in the centre of the polygon that is in the shape of a smaller concentric regular @xmath52-gon .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ figp2 ] , in tying this knot , the ribbon is segmented into @xmath52 congruent isosceles trapezoids .",
    "three of the sides of the trapezoid are equal to the side @xmath36 of the regular @xmath52-gon .",
    "the base of the trapezoid is again a chord of the circumscribing circle of length @xmath53 .",
    "the length of the ribbon ( measured along its centre line ) is @xmath54 while the width is @xmath55 .",
    "the closed length to width ratio for these knots is therefore @xmath56    we anticipate that this length to width ratio is not the ribbonlength for these knots .",
    "for example , in section  [ sec52 ] we discuss another method for tying the @xmath22 torus knot that leads to a smaller length to width ratio than the value @xmath57 just obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath58 is an upperbound for the ribbonlength of knots in this family .",
    "unlike the previous two families , the @xmath18 knots ( @xmath59 ) form  pinwheels \" rather than polygons when tied with ribbon ( figure  [ fig2qp1 ] )",
    ".     torus knot .",
    "[ fig2qp1 ] ]    however , like the other families , the ribbon is segmented into congruent isosceles trapezoids .",
    "each trapezoid has a top and base of length @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath41 is the width of the ribbon .",
    "the length to width ratio is , therefore , @xmath62 again , while this provides an upper bound for the ribbonlength , we anticipate that the ribbonlength for these knots is not realised by this construction .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate below ( section  [ sec52 ] ) how the @xmath21 torus knot can be tied with a smaller length to width ratio than the value @xmath63 just obtained .",
    "the regular polygons formed by @xmath0 and @xmath10 torus knots are odd - sided . in this section",
    "we examine the @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( where @xmath59 , odd ) torus knots which result in @xmath64- and @xmath65-sided regular polygons  @xcite , see figure  [ figeven ] .     and @xmath66 torus knots .",
    "[ figeven ] ]    with the exception of the @xmath67 torus knot , these are similar to the @xmath10 examples above in that there is a hole in centre of the polygon .",
    "they are also similar in that the length to width ratio is @xmath68 where @xmath69 or @xmath65 is the number of sides of the polygon . due to the polygonal hole in the centre , we anticipate that this length to width ratio is not the ribbonlength .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath67 torus knot which is formed with no gap in the centre ( figure  [ figeven ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that the ribbonlength of that knot is @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath0 ( for @xmath71 ) and @xmath10 ( for @xmath51 ) torus knots give us two different ways to construct each odd - sided polygon of seven or more sides .",
    "in addition , the @xmath25 torus knot results in a regular pentagon .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 knots ( for @xmath71 ) yield all the even sided regular polygons of eight or more sides .",
    "together these families account for all regular @xmath19-gons of seven or more sides as well as the regular pentagon .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate  shorter \" ways of tying the @xmath21 and @xmath22 torus knots .",
    "this suggests that the length to width ratios for the @xmath10 and @xmath18 knots above are likely not the ribbonlengths of those knots .",
    "in addition , we look at how the @xmath23 knot results in a rectangle .      we will tie a @xmath21 torus knot so as to obtain a smaller length to width ratio than the value @xmath72 obtained above . in figure",
    "[ fig52 ] ,     torus knot .",
    "[ fig52 ] ]    we illustrate how to tie this knot to form a pentagon much like the one given by the trefoil knot .",
    "two sides of the pentagon are used twice and we replace those sides by two parallel fold lines separated by a small distance @xmath73 .",
    "although the three lines joining the doubled sides should coincide , we have displaced them in the figure to show how those edges cross over one another .",
    "much like the trefoil knot , this way of folding @xmath21 will segment the ribbon into @xmath74 trapezoids ( as compared to the @xmath75 obtained for the closed trefoil ) .",
    "therefore , this method of folding the @xmath21 torus will result in a length to width ratio of approximately @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath22 torus knot can also be tied to realise a length to width ratio smaller than the value of @xmath78 mention above . as in figure",
    "[ fig72 ] ,     torus knot .",
    "[ fig72 ] ]    this knot also results in a pentagon - like shape .",
    "( again , coincident edges in the knot have been displaced in order to show crossings . ) this time the ribbon is segmented into @xmath79 trapezoids resulting in a length to width ratio of approximately @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "although it is not a torus knot , the @xmath23 knot can be folded to give a nice geometric shape , a @xmath82 rectangle  @xcite , see figure  [ fig74 ] .     knot .",
    "[ fig74 ] ]    the length to width ratio of this pattern is @xmath83 , as may easily be verified .",
    "however , this is likely not the ribbonlength for this knot .",
    "informal experiments suggest a ribbonlength of less than @xmath84 .",
    "in @xcite , kauffman reports on kusner s conjecture of a relationship between ribbonlength and crossing number : @xmath85 as the crossing number of a @xmath86 torus knot is @xmath87 , we can use our calculations of length to width ratios above to bound the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 . to this end , for each family of torus knots discussed above , we divide the length to width ratio by the crossing number .      dividing the conjectured ribbonlength by the crossing number @xmath88 yields @xmath89 for the truncation presentation and @xmath90 for the closed knot . as @xmath91 increases , the value of this ratio decreases , approaching @xmath92 in the limit .",
    "the largest values are obtained with the trefoil knot @xmath25 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the truncated and closed knot respectively .      dividing the length to width ratio by the crossing number @xmath52",
    ", we have @xmath95 .",
    "notice that this tends to infinity as @xmath52 increases .",
    "we take this as further evidence that this configuration does not realise the ribbonlength for these knots .",
    "since @xmath51 , the smallest value we obtain is @xmath96 for the closed @xmath22 torus knot .          for the @xmath11 torus knots , dividing the length to width ratio by the crossing number @xmath100 yields @xmath101 which tends to @xmath102 as @xmath91 goes to infinity .",
    "the @xmath67 knot gives the biggest ratio in this family : @xmath103 .",
    "the crossing number of the @xmath12 knots is @xmath104 .",
    "the resulting ratio @xmath105 again tends to @xmath106 as @xmath91 goes to infinity .",
    "the largest value in this family is the @xmath66 knot for which @xmath107    for the @xmath23 knot , on dividing the length to width ratio @xmath83 by the crossing number @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath108 . in @xcite ,",
    "the ribbonlength of the ( truncated ) figure eight knot is conjectured to be @xmath109 . dividing by the @xmath110 crossings , we have @xmath111 .",
    "each of the length to width ratios we have calculated above serves as an upper bound for the ribbonlength of the corresponding knot .",
    "therefore , the comparisons of these ratios with crossing number we have made in this section all serve to bound the constant @xmath5 of equation  [ eqkusner ] above . for closed knots , we have the bound @xmath3 realised by torus knots of the form @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the limit as @xmath91 goes to infinity . for truncated knots , the best bound is @xmath112 realised by @xmath0 torus knots as @xmath91 tends to infinity .",
    "in order to estimate @xmath6 , we restrict attention to those knots where we believe we know the ribbonlength , namely the @xmath0 torus knots , the knot @xmath67 and the figure eight knot @xcite . for truncated knots",
