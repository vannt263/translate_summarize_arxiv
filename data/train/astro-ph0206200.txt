    "the physical mechanisms responsible for the onset of bipolarity and polar acceleration in planetary nebulae ( pne ) are already active in the first stages of the evolution beyond the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , i.e@xmath14 in proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne , also called post - agb objects )",
    ". therefore , ppne and young pne hold the key for understanding the complex and fast ( @xmath410@xmath8yr ) nebular evolution from the agb towards the pn phase .",
    "such evolution is believed ( by an increasing number of astronomers ) to be governed by the interaction between fast , collimated winds or jets , ejected in the late - agb or early post - agb phase , and the spherical and slowly expanding circumstellar envelope ( cse ) resulted from the star mass - loss process during the agb ( see * ? ? ?",

    "most of the circumstellar matter in crl618  is still in the form of molecular gas .",
    "this component , with a total mass of @xmath151.5 , consists of : ( 1 ) a spherical and extended ( @xmath1620 ) envelope expanding at 17.5@xcite ; and ( 2 ) an inner , compact bipolar outflow moving away from the star at velocities @xmath16200  @xcite .",
    "the outer , and slowly expanding component is interpreted as the result from the mass - loss process of the central star during the agb , which took place at a rate of = few@xmath710@xmath12 - 10@xmath11 . the fast bipolar outflow , with a mass of @xmath410@xmath17 , is believed to be the result of the interaction between a fast , collimated post - agb wind and the spherical agb cse ( see references above ) .",
    "the high - excitation nebula ( atomic and ionized gas ) is composed of : ( 1 ) a compact region , visible through radio - continuum emission , elongated in the e - w direction with an angular size of 02 - 04 that is increasing with time @xcite ; and ( 2 ) multiple lobes with shock - excited gas which produces recombination and forbidden line emission in the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the optical spectrum of crl618  also shows a weak , red continuum which is the stellar light reflected by the nebular dust . from spectropolarimetric observations",
    "it is known that a fraction of the flux of the balmer lines is also scattered light originally arising from the inner , compact region @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the forbidden lines is negligible , indicating that they are almost entirely produced by the shock - excited gas in the lobes with a small or insignificant contribution by scattered photons from the region ( the high density in this region , @xmath410@xmath183 , produces collisional de - excitation of most forbidden lines ) .",

    "we have obtained narrow - band images of the h@xmath0 line and the adjacent continuum emission in the ppn crl618(fig@xmath14[f1]a , b ) .",
    "observations were carried out on november 8@xmath22 and 9@xmath22 , 2001 with the palomar observatory 60-inch telescope .",
    "the detector was the ccd camera # 13 , which has 2048@xmath72048 pixels of 24@xmath23 m in size and provides a plate scale of 0378pixel@xmath24 .",
    "the narrow - band filters used for imaging the h@xmath0 line and adjacent continuum are centered at 6563 and 6616 , respectively , and have a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 20 .",
    "weather conditions during the observations were good , although non - photometric , and the seeing ranged between 09 and 2 .",
    "the final spatial resolution of the h@xmath0 ( continuum ) combined images is 19 ( 11 ) .",
    "total exposure times are 2700s for the h@xmath0 image and 6300s for the continuum .",
    "data reduction , including bias subtraction , flat field correction , removal of cosmic rays and bad pixels , and registering+combination of individual images , was performed following standard procedures within iraf .",
    "astrometry of our images was done cross - correlating the coordinates of 376 and 187 field stars ( for h@xmath0 and the continuum , respectively ) in the ccd and those in the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "this procedure yields a plate scale of 0378@xmath20009pixel@xmath24 .",
    "the coordinates of the origin of our spatial scale in our images are r.a.= 04@xmath2542@xmath265355 and dec.= 3606545 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the errors of the absolute positions derived are @xmath1304 ( considering the standard deviation of our best calibration solution , 015 , and the absolute position error of the usno stars , about 025 ) .",
    "we have obtained a pure h@xmath0 line emission image by subtracting the continuum emission to our original h@xmath0+continuum image .",
    "the continuum image was first smoothed to match the lower effective spatial resolution of the h@xmath0 image and then the flux of several field stars was measured in both images to derive a scaling factor that includes the differences of the system ` filter+ccd ' response between the two images as well as the different exposure times and sky transparency when the observations were performed .",
    "flux calibration was performed using the usno - a2.0 @xmath27 magnitudes of the field stars .",
    "the error in the flux calibration is dominated by the absolute flux error in the usno - a2.0 catalog ( @xmath455% ) .",
    "the flux calibration of the h@xmath0 and continuum images is consistent with our calibrated long - slit spectra within a factor @xmath132 .      as a complement to our data",

    "two spectra were obtained : one with the slit placed on the northernmost pair of lobes ( hereafter , slit n93 ) and the other one with the slit displaced @xmath41  towards the south ( partially covering the southernmost lobes ; slit s93 ) . at position n93 ,",
    "spectra with two gratings , r1200y and r900v , were obtained with exposures times of 2000s and 2700s , respectively . for the other two slit positions ( s93 and pa=3 ) only the r1200y was used , and exposure times were 2000s and 1300s respectively .",
    "the slit was 1  wide and long enough to cover the whole nebula ( and a significant region of the sky ) .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures for long - slit spectroscopy within the iraf package , including bias subtraction , flat - fielding and illumination corrections , sky subtraction , and cosmic - ray rejection .",
    "we used cune and cuar lamps to perform the wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectral resolution achieved ( fwhm of the calibration lamp lines ) is @xmath450 , at h@xmath0 , and @xmath480 , at h@xmath29 .",
    "flux calibration was done using sensitivity functions derived from two spectrophotometric standards , hr1544 and hd217086 , observed at different airmasses , and taking into account the atmospheric extinction curve at la palma .",
    "the geometric distortion of the long - slit spectra ( @xmath40.06% ) was corrected also using one of the flux calibration stars .",
    "the effective spatial resolution obtained ranges between @xmath41  and 16 .",
    "in fig@xmath14[f1 ] we show direct images of the ppn crl618  in the light of the 6616  continuum ( a ) and h@xmath0 line emission ( b and c ) obtained from the ground and with @xmath3 .",
    "the h@xmath0 images show the shocked , optical lobes of crl618  consist of several components with a very rich structure at a scale of @xmath402 ( see fig@xmath14[f1]c ) .",
    "the east and west lobes are both composed of several , collimated jet - like structures emanating from the center of the nebula .",
    "bright , bow - shaped ripple - like features are frequent along the lobes .    in the h@xmath0 images of crl618 we have labeled a the small , bright region of the east lobe closer to the nebular center ( fig@xmath14[f1]c ) .",
    "this region is very bright in the h@xmath0 image but very weak , e.g. , in the wfpc2/@xmath3 [ ] @xmath56300  and [ ] @xmath5@xmath56716,6731  images ( see trammell 2000 ; sahai et al@xmath14 2002 , in preparation ) . as we will see in the following sections , the spectrum of region a is in fact substantially different from that of the shock - excited lobes",
    "this leads us to think that region a has a different nature , which we discuss in  [ spdist ] .",
    "a weak h@xmath0 emission halo surrounds the lobes of crl618(fig@xmath14[f1]b , c ) . in the @xmath3 h@xmath0 image the halo",
    "is observed very close to the boundaries of the emission lobes and is particularly intense and extended in the east lobe : note the clumps of diffuse emission ahead of this lobe ( i.e@xmath14 just beyond the tip of the lobe ) .",
    "the diffuse halo , like region a , is absent in the [ ] and [ ] @xmath3 images ( see references above ) . in our ground - based h@xmath0 image ( with higher signal - to - noise ratio than that obtained with the @xmath3 ) the size at a 3@xmath30 level of the halo is @xmath435@xmath722 , with the major axis roughly oriented at pa=3  and centered at the position where the maximum h@xmath0 emission is observed .",
    "the continuum image of crl618  traces the distribution of the dust particles in the nebula ( which reflect the stellar light ) as well as any field star .",
    "the central star of crl618 is not directly visible , which indicates that the stellar light is strongly obscured along the line of sight .",
    "the continuum brightness distribution is in general similar to that of h@xmath0 , suggesting the presence of dust in the lobes .",
    "the optical spectrum of crl618 is composed of recombination and forbidden line emission superimposed on a faint , red continuum .      in fig@xmath14[f2 ]",
    "we show long - slit spectra for the most intense lines in the @xmath4[62306805]  range for slits n93 , s93 , and pa3 .",
    "the weakest lines detected in this range , [ ] @xmath56312.1  and @xmath56678 , for slit n93 are shown in fig@xmath14[f3 ] .",
    "these spectra have been smoothed with a flat - topped rectangular kernel of dimension 3@xmath73 pixels : the resulting degradation in the spatial and spectral resolution is less than @xmath44% from the nominal value ( see  [ obsop ] ) since the smoothing window was smaller than the local seeing and fwhm of the calibration lines . the origin of the spatial scale in the spectra ( and in the images to the left and in fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) coincides with the point of maximum extinction ( measured as the highest h@xmath0/h@xmath29 line ratio ;  [ sext ] )",
    ". we will refer to this point also as to nebular center .",
    "the lsr systemic velocity of the source , = 21.5@xmath20.5  ( derived from molecular line emission observations , e.g@xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is indicated by a vertical line on each spectrum .",
    "we find remarkable differences between the profile of the h@xmath0 line ( and also h@xmath29 , see below ) and those of most forbidden lines for each slit position .",
    "these differences are specially noticeable in the bright east lobe . a number of spectral features ( labeled a , b , and c in fig@xmath14[f4 ] )",
    "are seen to be superimposed on an underlying h@xmath0 profile very similar to that of [ ] @xmath56300  ( and most forbidden lines ) .",
    "( carsenty & solf , 1982 , noted also the presence of two different components in the h@xmath0 profile , see  [ features ] ) .",

    "the maximum emission from this feature occurs at offset @xmath414 . for",
    "slit n93 such maximum is slightly red - shifted ( @xmath43.5 ) with respect to whereas for s93 , feature a is blue - shifted by @xmath410 . from comparison with the h@xmath0 images of crl618  we determine that feature a originates in the inner region a",
    "( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "there is also some blue - shifted [ ] @xmath316548,6584 , [ ] @xmath56312  and @xmath56678emission arising in this region , which we refer to as emission feature `` a '' by analogy to feature a in the h@xmath0 profile ( figs@xmath14[f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) .",
    "feature b is the broad , red - shifted wing around offset @xmath4@xmath3225 and + 35 , in our n93 and s93 spectra .",
    "this feature is prominent in regions where the _ scattered continuum _ reaches maximum intensity ( see fig@xmath14[f5 ] and the continuum image in fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "feature b is also present in the pa3 h@xmath0 spectra .",
    "feature c is the slightly red - shifted emission component observed close to the systemic velocity from offsets + 6 to + 12  in our n93 and s93 spectra .",
    "we note that feature c extends beyond the region where forbidden line emission is observed ( i.e. , beyond the shocked lobes ) . from comparison with the h@xmath0 direct images of the nebula we conclude that feature c originates in the weak ` halo ' which surrounds the bright lobes ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "this halo is visible towards the east up to offsets + 20  in our deep , h@xmath0 ground - based image .",
    "feature c is also present along slit pa3 , which crosses the lobes and the halo at the outermost parts of the east lobe .",
    "we have labeled  c ? \" the weak , red - shifted emission beyond the west lobe in slits n93 and s93 ( fig@xmath14[f4 ] ) .",
    "this tentative feature ( also marginally present in the h@xmath29 profile ) has a redshift slightly larger than that of feature c.    for slit s93 , the maxima in the h@xmath0 and forbidden ( e.g@xmath14 [ ] ) line emission are observed at different spatial and spectral positions : the h@xmath0 emission peak is red - shifted and located at offset @xmath435 , whereas the maximum emission from most forbidden lines is clearly blue - shifted and located at offset @xmath442 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the h@xmath0 emission peak is most likely the result of the superposition of features c , b , and maybe a on top of the lobe emission and not only emission produced locally in the east lobe .    in fig@xmath14[f5 ]",
    "we present the long - slit spectra obtained along the nebular axis ( n93 ) in the wavelength range [ 4558 - 5331] .",
    "the h@xmath29 profile is similar to that of h@xmath0 , except that feature a is less prominent for the former very likely due to a larger extinction towards the nebular center .",

    "the profile of [ ] @xmath55007  is similar to that of h@xmath29 : note the maximum emission slightly red - shifted at the position where the continuum is detected in our spectra ( coincident with feature b in h@xmath0 ) and the weak emission closer to the nebular center ( coincident with feature a ) .",
    "the profile of the [ ] doublet ( partially resolved ) is different from h@xmath29 and [ ] but similar to most forbidden lines in the red .",
    "we have detected a number of weak emission lines in this wavelength range , most of them from fe ions .",
    "the [ ] lines , similarly to the [ ] @xmath33 line , are observed in the region where the scattered continuum reaches its maximum intensity and in the inner region where feature a arises , with no trace of emission from the outer parts of the shocked lobes .",
    "the [ ] lines are remarkably intense at the tips of the lobes and show no sign of h@xmath0-analog features , i.e@xmath14 they show no emission from region a or the region of maximal continuum emission .    at 4650",
    ", we also detect a faint and broad emission feature , which is only visible in the region where the continuum is observed for the east lobe .",
    "we identify this feature with the wolf - rayet bump at 4650  ( see below ) .",
    "we list in table [ table1 ] all the lines that we have detected in the optical spectra of crl618 together with their air wavelengths and fluxes ( undereddened ) .",
    "the fluxes have been estimated from slit n93 ( for other slits only the lines in the red wavelength range were observed ) , integrating the emission of the pixels above the 3@xmath30 level along the slit and in the spectral direction .",
    "most of the lines in table [ table1 ] were already detected and identified in this source from previous optical spectroscopy ( see references in  [ intro ] ) , however we find some new features in this work .",
    "the most relevant of the new identifications is the wolf - rayet bump ( wr - bump ) at @xmath44650  ( fig@xmath14[f5 ] ) .",
    "this bump is a blend of high excitation lines such as @xmath54634 - 41 , and @xmath54647 - 51  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath54658.3  line , usually considered as a part of the wr - bump , is listed separately in table [ table1 ] together with the blended [ ] @xmath54658.1  line , because it is spectrally resolved from the rest of the bump in our spectra .",

    "these high - excitation transitions are the result of nebular emission .",
    "therefore , the presence of the wr - bump in the spectrum of crl618 , while potentially interesting and deserving further investigation , is not sufficient to conclude that it has a [ wc]-type central star .",

    "the one - dimensional blue spectrum for this region is shown in fig@xmath14[f5 ] , where the presence of @xmath54685.55  ( also reported by the first time in this work ) and other high excitation ( fe ? ) lines , can be noticed .",
    "emission around 5007  was detected previously with a low signal - to - noise ratio and attributed to a blend of @xmath34@xmath35 $ ] and @xmath34@xmath35 $ ] lines @xcite .",
    "we have also detected the @xmath34@xmath35\\lambda$]4959 line in our deep spectra with a total flux @xmath41/3 of the @xmath34@xmath35\\lambda$]5007 ( table [ table1 ] ) as theoretically expected regardless of the nebular conditions .",
    "accordingly , the flux measured at 5007  must be mostly due to the @xmath34@xmath35$]@xmath55007  line .",
    "we have compared the absolute fluxes measured in the present work with the fluxes measured by @xcite . for most of the lines we find good agreement , our fluxes being on average @xmath42.2 and @xmath41.6 ( for the east and west lobes , respectively ) times smaller than those measured by kelly et al@xmath14 , as expected from the different slit widths used in both observations ( they use a 25-wide slit , covering the nebula almost totally in the equatorial direction and totally along the axis ) .",

    "the values of the [ ] /h@xmath0 line ratio measured in previous works , summarized in table [ oivstime ] and fig@xmath14[f6 ] , confirm the progressive weakening with time of the [ ] transitions .",
    "a relatively weak continuum is clearly visible in the blue ( r900v ) long - slit spectra along the nebular axis around offset 3  ( on the bright east lobe , see fig@xmath14[f5 ] , top ) .",
    "this position corresponds to the relative maximum in the continuum brightness distribution seen in the direct image ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "we also detect continuum emission at the same position in the red spectra ( r1200y ) for slits n93 and s93 , and also , at the spatial origin for slit pa3 , but with smaller signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the red continuum is only visible in substantially smoothed spectra ( not shown here ) .",
    "the average surface brightness of the red ( blue ) continuum , measured from our long - slit spectra in a 1@xmath71  region around offset 3  is @xmath48@xmath710@xmath36 ( @xmath45@xmath710@xmath36 ) .",
    "the continuum brightness has been measured in a spectral window of 80  in the vicinity of h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 , respectively .",

    "our measurements of the red continuum flux are in reasonably agreement with previous estimates by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the continuum at blue wavelengths in our spectra is only a factor @xmath41/1.6 weaker than the red , whereas from the data given by the previous authors we measure a blue - to - red continuum ratio of @xmath41/2.4 .",
    "note that although the absolute flux calibration can be uncertain up to a factor @xmath450% , the relative flux value is more accurate .",
    "this difference is consistent with a blue brightening of a factor @xmath41.5 ( @xmath40.44 mag ) in the last 10 years ( assuming that the red continuum flux has not varied ) .",
    "@xcite reported an increase of @xmath42 mag in @xmath37-band , from measurements between 1922 and 1975 .",
    "these authors derived a @xmath37-band brightening rate of 0.06mag / yr , which is roughly consistent with our results .",
    "these authors attributed the increase of the blue continuum flux to the expansion of the circumstellar envelope of crl618  and the subsequent decrease of the extinction .",
    "we find remarkable differences between the long - slit profiles of the recombination and forbidden emission lines in crl618 .",
    "figs@xmath14[f2 ] and [ f4 ] clearly show the presence of three ` extra ' emission features ( a , b , and c ) in the h@xmath0 spectrum compared to the profile of most forbidden lines .",

    "we analyze the origin of these features .    _ feature a _ , the intense h@xmath0 emission observed close to the nebular center in slits n93 and s93 , _ arises in the inner region a _ ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "this region is very bright in the @xmath3 h@xmath0 image but much weaker in the light of [ ] and [ ] @xcite .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the absence of feature a in our spectra for these forbidden transitions .",

    "the counterpart to this feature observed in other recombination and forbidden lines is also blue - shifted : for [ ] @xmath56584 , feature _ a _ is blue - shifted by @xmath425 and 33  at position n93 and s93 , respectively ; for h@xmath29 , [ ] @xmath55007 , and [ ] @xmath56312 , observed only at position n93 , the blue - shift is @xmath48 - 12 .",
    "the measured doppler blue - shift suggests that _ feature a is locally produced within the east lobe _ , which is approaching towards us . for slit n93 , feature a lies at , showing no apparent shift towards the blue .",
    "we believe that in this case the spectral position of the h@xmath0 feature a could be altered ( slightly red - shifted ) because of the presence of feature b at almost the same spatial position , which is relatively intense and is clearly red - shifted in the east lobe .",
    "the blue - shift of feature a could also be intrinsically smaller for position n93 than for s93 , as suggested by the smaller blue velocities of its counterpart ( feature _ a _ ) in the other lines .",
    "_ features b and c _ are most likely the _ scattered component _ of the emission in the balmer lines for this source (  [ intro ] ) .",
    "previous spectropolarimetric observations indicate that @xmath440% of the total h@xmath0 flux is polarized ( with a line polarization of about 15% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e@xmath14 it is light scattered by nebular dust .",
    "the polarization of the forbidden lines is , however , much lower and this would explain the absence of these features in these cases .",
    "features b and c are red - shifted , although they originate in the approaching lobe ( note that the forbidden line emission from the east lobe is blue - shifted ) , which clearly points to their scattered nature : the light scattered by dust moving away from the central source should be red - shifted for both the approaching and receding lobe ( see e.g@xmath14 * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also found some red - shifted h@xmath0 emission ( probably our feature b ) arising in the approaching bright lobe which they attribute to scattered emission following the same argument .",
    "the previous interpretation is consistent with the similar brightness distribution of these features and the continuum ( figs@xmath14[f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) , as expected if they share the same scattered nature .",
    "feature b is clearly most prominent in the region of maximum continuum emission for all the slits positions .",
    "moreover , features b and c are much more intense for the east lobe than for the west one , where the scattered continuum is much weaker and the fraction of polarized light smaller ( 0.5 versus 0.2 , for the east and west lobe respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the different profiles and spatial distributions of features b and c in our long - slit spectra suggests that they are produced by dust in different nebular regions",
    ". the low red - shift of feature c ( @xmath46 - 8 ) and its location ( beyond the forbidden - line emitting east lobe , in the weak h@xmath0 halo ) points to dust not located inside the lobe but beyond it , in the unshocked , slowly expanding agb cse .",
    "since the agb cse surrounds the lobes , we can expect feature c to be present ( with more or less intensity ) all along the slits .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of the diffuse halo surrounding the lobes in the h@xmath0 images , and not only in front of them ( see below ) . the tentative feature  c ? \" , observed at the tip of the west lobe , could be the counterpart to feature c in the receding lobe .",
    "the much larger red - shift of feature b ( up to lsr velocities of @xmath4240 ) and its location ( within the lobes ) is more consistent with dust inside the shocked - lobes which is flowing outwards rapidly ( presumably at the same speed as the gas ) .",
    "we identify this feature with the red - shifted h@xmath0 emission detected by @xcite in the east lobe , which they also attribute to scattered emission produced by fast outflowing dust . at the position where feature b is observed , some contribution by feature c is also expected ( see above ) , however , the spectral resolution achieved in these observations is not sufficient to separate both features .    the line emission that is being reflected by the dust , visible as the halo ( in the direct images ) and as features b and c ( in our long - slit spectra ) , is unlikely to originate in the shocked - lobes themselves .",
    "in fact , neither the halo , nor features b and c are detected in most forbidden lines , and in particular , in the [ ] line .",
    "however , the [ ] and h@xmath0 emission _ locally _ produced in the east lobe have comparable intensities ( fig@xmath14[f4 ] and @xmath3 images in trammell 2000 ) , which should result in almost equally bright scattered components for both lines if the reflected photons were originally produced in the lobes .",
    "features b and c must then result from the reflection of light produced in the nebular center ( in the central region or / and in region a ) , where the emission of most forbidden lines observed by us is intrinsically much less intense .",
    "the presence or absence of the different spectral features and , in general , the profiles of the different lines are diagnostic of the physical properties ( such as temperature , ionization , and electron density ) of different nebular regions in crl618 , from the highly obscured region to the shocked lobes .",
    "this region is _ indirectly _ probed by lines with b- or c - like features ( scattered light ) , namely h@xmath0 , h@xmath29 , [ ] , , , [ ] , [ ] , and the wr - bump .",
    "the spectrum of the central region is thus most easily seen in the region where the scattered continuum is observed , at offset @xmath43  in the east lobe .",
    "the central region ( previously studied through its radio - continuum emission , see  [ intro ] ) is characterized by high densities ( @xmath1610@xmath383 ) and high temperatures ( 13,000 - 15,000k ) that provide the required conditions to produce most of the ( high - excitation ) lines above ( e.g. , the ionization potential of the [ ] , [ ] , , and wr - bump are 16.16 , 23.33 , 24.59 and @xmath1630 ev , respectively ) .",
    "the large critical densities for the observed [ ] and [ ] transitions , @xmath39@xmath410@xmath40@xmath41 , explain why these forbidden lines are not de - excited by collisions in the central region of crl618 .",
    "we note also , that the relatively large critical density of the [ ] @xmath55007 transition , few@xmath710@xmath423 , would explain the weak [ ] @xmath55007 emission from the inner region , which is indirectly observed at the position of maximal continuum and feature b. unfortunately spectropolarimetry of the lines listed above presumably arising from the region has not been obtained previously , so we do not know their polarization degree ( nor the fraction of scattered flux ) and we can not test the previous scenario . in any case",
    "it seems that these high excitation lines are unlikely to be produced in the shocked lobes , where the spectrum is dominated by low excitation lines .",
    "this region is also very likely a relatively dense region , considering that only forbidden lines with high critical densities ( @xmath39@xmath16few@xmath710@xmath93 ) are observed therein , namely : [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] .",
    "the spectrum of this region ( the innermost part of the east lobe , where features a and _ a _ are observed ) is remarkably different from that of the shocked lobes but very similar to that of the central region .",
    "in fact , most lines are common to both regions except for the absence of the wr - bump ( which requires higher excitation conditions ) in region a and the undetected [ ] emission ( with a low critical density , @xmath39@xmath42@xmath710@xmath93 ) from the denser region .",
    "this fact suggests that region a is more likely to be ionized by the uv stellar radiation rather than by shocks . in this sense ,",
    "region a represents the outermost ( less dense ) parts of the region surrounding the star .",
    "the observed relative line intensities are not consistent with any of the different shock - excitation models by @xcite ( hereafter hrh87 ) .",
    "the very weak emission of the [ ] lines from region a ( [ ] /h@xmath0@xmath430.05 ) implies that this region is fully ionized ( e.g@xmath14 * ? ? ?",
    "the observed [ ] transitions have relatively high critical densities ( @xmath39@xmath42@xmath710@xmath183 ) and , therefore , significant collisional de - excitation of the involved levels is not expected . therefore , the weakness of the [ ] transitions is because most oxygen in region a is ionized . considering the similar ionization potentials of oxygen and hydrogen ,",
    "we conclude that the ionization fraction ( x=@xmath44 ) of region a , like that of the inner region ( where [ ] is not detected ) is @xmath41 .",
    "this region is probed by lines without any additional features ( a , b , or c ) .",
    "the most intense of these lines ( [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] ) are known to originate entirely from the gas in the lobes since for these lines , no polarization has been measured @xcite and no red - shifted components are found in the approaching lobe . although no polarimetry of the rest of the lines within this class has been made , we conclude that they must have a similar origin given their similar profiles .",
    "the relative intensities of the lines observed at the lobes ( dereddened using the average extinction for each lobe , see  [ sext ] below ) are consistent with shock - excited emission .",
    "in particular , the flux ratios observed by us lie in between the predicted values for bow - shock excitation models 8 and 9 by hrh87 with shock velocities between 50 and 100  and preshock density 3003 .",
    "these range of velocities for the shocks is mainly constrained by the detected , although weak , [ ] @xmath55007  emission and implies shock speeds slighly larger ( but still comparable ) to previous estimates following similar procedures ( @xmath45=20 - 80 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the higher shock velocity derived by us is basically due to the higher [ ] flux obtained in our observations .    [ ] and [ ] lines show the largest intensity contrast between the tips and the innermost regions of the lobes amongst forbidden transitions .",
    "[ ] lines are known to be good tracers of astrophysical shocks ( in supernovae , herbig haro objects , pne , etc ) : [ ] lines are very sensitive to the high densities and temperatures in the shocked gas ; moreover , fast shocks are able to extract substantial amounts of fe from dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the intensity enhancement of the [ ] ( and [ ] ) lines is very likely related to the presence of intense shocks in these regions .",
    "in addition , the strongest [ ] line emission is expected in regions where the compression and heating of the gas is largest , for example , at the head of a bow shock , where the velocity component normal to the shock is greatest .",
    "the presence of bow - shocks at the tips of the lobes of crl618 , where the maximum [ ] emission is observed , is suggested by bright , curved features in the direct @xmath3 images of the nebula ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "finally , the presence of intense [ ] lines in the shock - heated and compressed gas in the lobes of crl618  points to dissociative ( @xmath4630 ) j - shocks rather than c - shocks @xcite , consistent with the relatively large shock velocity derived from diagnostic line ratios and the kinematics of the lobes ( see sect@xmath14 [ str+kin ] ) .",
    "the ionization fraction in the shocked lobes is significantly lower than in region a as suggested by the much larger [ ] @xmath56300/h@xmath0 ratio , @xmath40.5 - 0.9 ( excluding scattered light ) , in the former .",
    "we discuss in detail the ionization in the lobes in sect@xmath14 [ mass ] .",
    "a diffuse halo surrounding the bright optical lobes of crl618  is visible in the h@xmath0 direct images of the nebula ( figs@xmath14[f1]b , c ) .",
    "the scattered feature c in the h@xmath0 spectra arises in this halo , and it is particularly noticeable in the region just beyond the tip of the east lobe .",
    "accordingly , the h@xmath0 emission from this halo is very likely light ( originally arising in the region ) that escapes preferentially in the direction of the lobes and is scattered by the innermost parts of the agb cse .",
    "( the more distant regions of the agb cse are visible in molecular line emission ,  [ intro ] . )",
    "the presence of scattered features ( c and b ) in the h@xmath0 spectrum of crl618  offers a valuable opportunity to derive the inclination of the nebula : by comparison of the red - shift of the scattered emission with the intrinsic velocity of the dust ( whenever these quantities can be determined ) . features b and c are produced , respectively , by : ( i ) fast - moving dust mixed with the atomic gas inside or in the walls of the lobes ; and ( ii ) dust beyond the lobes , in the slowly expanding , extended envelope which surrounds the optical lobes ( see  [ features ] and fig@xmath14[f7 ] ) .",
    "the limited spectral resolution in our spectra does not allow us to separately measure the red - shift of features b and c when both components are simultaneously present ( all along the east lobe up to offsets @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , at the tip of the east lobe , only feature c is observed in the h@xmath0 spectra , and the red - shift of this feature can be accurately determined . by comparison of this red - shift with the intrinsic expansion velocity of the dust in the agb cse producing feature c , @xmath47@xmath417.5  lsr (  [ intro ] )",
    ", we can readily derive the nebular inclination .",
    "the red - shift of feature c is apparent in fig@xmath14[f8 ] ( left ) , where we show its spectral profile derived from slits n93 and s93 integrating the long - slit spectra from offsets 85 to 115 .",
    "the red - shift of feature c for both slit positions has been obtained by fitting a gaussian function to the core of the feature , which is roughly symmetric . for n93 and s93 ,",
    "the red - shift with respect to  ( given by the gaussian center ) is 8@xmath21.5 and 6@xmath21.5  respectively .",
    "these values yield an inclination ( with respect to the plane of the sky ) of @xmath427@xmath26  ( from slit n93 ) and 20@xmath25  ( from slit s93 ) for the dust reflecting the h@xmath0 photons ahead of the east lobe .    as we have shown , feature c beyond the east lobe has its counterpart in the weak halo seen in the h@xmath0 images of the nebula at the same position ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "the orientation of this halo and the pure emission lobe in the plane of the sky is roughly the same .",
    "this is most likely due to light from the core escaping preferentially along the lobes of crl618 .",
    "hence we can expect the previous values of the inclination to be a relatively good representation of the mean nebular inclination ( for an overall axial symmetry ) .",
    "the different inclinations ( @xmath48@xmath1=7 ) derived for feature c in slits s93 and n93 could indicate different orientations of the different lobe components along the line - of - sight , a likely possibility given their different orientations in the plane of the sky ( @xmath48pa@xmath415 )",
    ".    we can also derive @xmath1 by measuring the velocity of feature b ( @xmath49 ) with respect to the local emission component ( @xmath50 , obtained from the forbidden lines ) at the same position .",
    "@xmath51=@xmath49-@xmath50 is a direct measurement of the intrinsic expansion velocity of the lobes , therefore @xmath1=sin@xmath52 . from our spectra",
    ", we can derive only a lower limit to the red - shift of feature b because the h@xmath0 profile has also important contributions from features a and c at the position where feature b is observed ( offset @xmath43 ) .",
    "this leads to a combined h@xmath0 profile with a smaller red - shift than that of feature b alone and , therefore , only a lower limit to the intrinsic expansion velocity of the lobes .",
    "the lower limit for @xmath51 translates into an upper limit for @xmath1 .    in the right panel of fig@xmath14 [ f8 ] , we show h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath56300  1d - spectra at the position where the scattered continuum and feature b reach maximum intensity in the east lobe for slit n93 .",
    "the velocities of the h@xmath0 and [ ] lines measured ( with uncertainties of @xmath21.5 ) at the peak are @xmath53=5 , @xmath50=@xmath3255 , which yields @xmath51@xmath1060  ( at this position ) and @xmath1@xmath4334 . if , instead of using the line peaks for the velocity measurements , we use the centroids of the full width at half maximum ( @xmath53=5 , @xmath50=@xmath3263 , @xmath51@xmath1068 ) , or the centroids of the full width at a 3@xmath30 level ( @xmath53=@xmath326 , @xmath54=@xmath3267 , @xmath51@xmath1073 ) , we get values of @xmath55  and @xmath56 , respectively .    the mean value of , and upper limit to , the inclination derived above are smaller than the inclination previously obtained by @xcite ( hereafter cs82 ) .",
    "these authors obtain @xmath1=45 , based on the analysis of the h@xmath0 scattered component produced by the fast dust within the lobes .",
    "we believe this difference can be due to several reasons :    first , the value given by cs82  for the intrinsic speed of the outflow , 80  is really a lower limit to @xmath51 because of the presence of multiple components in the h@xmath0 profile ( as explained above ) .",
    "second , the value for the radial velocity difference between the east and west lobes ( which is equal to 2@xmath51sin@xmath1 ) measured by cs82  from the forbidden line emission ( e.g@xmath14 [ ] @xmath316548,6583 , [ ] @xmath316716,6731 ) , 114 , is most likely an overestimate . this is because the radial velocity difference between the lobes is not constant along their length ( see figs@xmath14[f2 ] and [ f4 ] and table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the 114  velocity difference occurs only at the tips of the lobes ( at offsets @xmath26 ) .",
    "but in the region where the most intense h@xmath0 scattered emission is observed ( offset @xmath43 ) , coincident with the position where cs82  measure the red - shift of the h@xmath0 scattered component , we observe a smaller radial velocity difference , @xmath490 .",
    "thus , if we use a larger value of the outflow speed ( @xmath1080 ) and a smaller radial velocity difference ( @xmath490 ) in the cs82  method , we get an upper limit to the inclination of @xmath4334 , which is consistent with our previous estimates .",
    "finally , a low mean value of the inclination is in better agreement with the similar average extinction deduced for the east and west lobe ( see  [ sext ] ) .",
    "in order to study the kinematics in the lobes of crl618 we have chosen the most intense forbidden lines , which originate in the lobes and have profiles uncontaminated by scattered light components . since the [ ] lines have also some contribution from reflected light ( trammell , dinerstein , and goodrich , 1993 , found that the polarization of these lines is @xmath46% ) , we have based most of our analysis on the intense , unpolarized [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "the [ ] and [ ] profiles along the slit n93 for the west and east lobe are approximately point - symmetric with respect to the spatial origin and systemic velocity ( fig@xmath14 [ f2 ] ) , suggesting that they have probably a similar kinematical structure .",
    "this result is not in principle expected from the different morphology of the east and west lobes .",
    "the projected radial velocity gradient is not constant in either lobe . in the innermost parts of the lobes",
    "the projected velocity decreases with the distance from the nebular center , this behavior being more pronounced in the east lobe ( table [ table2 ] ) . in the outer parts of the lobes , the velocity increases with the distance , reaching projected velocities ( with respect to ) up to 70 and 80  at the tip of the east and west lobe , respectively . in these regions ,",
    "the emission arises in the compact , bow - shaped emitting knots at @xmath26 . considering the low inclination for the nebula derived in  [ incli ] , @xmath5724 , the lobes of crl618  are expanding with velocities up to @xmath4200  ( at the tips ) .",
    "the changing radial velocity gradient observed in our low angular - resolution ( ground - based ) spectra may result from superposition of multiple kinematical components as suggested by the complex morphology and small scale ( @xmath402 ) structure seen in the @xmath3 images .",
    "of course it is also possible that there are acceleration and deceleration processes operating in the lobes .",
    "the fwhm of the forbidden lines along the lobes also increases outwards , from 6075  closer to the nebula center , to @xmath4150  at the lobe tips ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the large line widths measured at the tips of the lobes ( fig@xmath14[f9 ] ) are consistent with the bow - shaped features being regions accelerated by bow - shocks : the different orientations of the velocity vectors in a bow - shock structure produce a large velocity dispersion ( see e.g@xmath14 hrh87 ) .",
    "the total width ( at zero intensity level ) of the line does not strongly vary along the lobes but rather is fairly constant with a mean value of @xmath4200 .",
    "the spectral profile of any low - excitation emission line from a bow - shock can be used to estimate the shock velocity , @xmath58 .",
    "the shock velocity equals the full width ( at zero intensity ) of the line for radiating bow - shocks , independent of orientation angle , pre - shock density , bow - shock shape , and pre - shock ionization stage ( hrh87 ) .",
    "we derive @xmath58=200 - 230  for the bow - shocks seen at the tips of the east and west lobes .",
    "this value agrees well with the value of @xmath58 inferred directly from the projected velocities of these regions assuming an inclination of 24 .",
    "this result therefore supports the low inclination of the nebula we have derived (  [ incli ] ) .",
    "in addition , the centrally - peaked profiles in fig@xmath14[f9 ] are consistent with the predictions for bow - shock models by hrh87  with @xmath5925  ( for larger inclinations the model profiles show two well separated peaks ) .",
    "the shock velocity derived from the observed line ratios and their comparison with predictions of bow - shock excitation models by hrh87(@xmath58@xmath4390 ,  [ lobes ] ) is smaller than that directly derived from the line profile .",
    "similar differences are also present for many herbig - haro objects observed and modeled by these authors suggesting that the existing models ( necessarily simplistic ) can not accurately reproduce the complex excitation and spatio - kinematical structure of the shocked material .",
    "moreover , the preshock density in the hrh87  models , 3003 , is very likely lower than the actual value ( see  [ discuss ] ) .",
    "the shock velocity obtained from the line profile is probably less affected by errors in the model , since it arises only from geometrical considerations , and may better represent the actual velocity of the shock .",
    "only if the line emission from the shocked post - agb wind itself ( which is moving faster than the forward shocks ) was significant compared to that from the shocked agb ambient material ( unlikely to be the case in crl618 ; c - f@xmath14 lee and sahai , in preparation ) , then the line fwzi would be an upper limit to @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath58 derived from the line ratios depends on poorly known parameters like , e.g. , the presence and strength of magnetic fields . models with higher magnetic fields require substantially larger shock velocities to reproduce the same line ratios @xcite .",
    "for example , for a pre - shock density @xmath1610@xmath423 (  [ discuss ] ) , magnetic fields of @xmath430@xmath23 g are required to reproduce the dereddened [ ] @xmath56583/[]@xmath56300 ratio ( @xmath40.5 , see table [ table1 ] and  [ sext ] ) for a planar shock with speed @xmath58=90 . to produce the same ratio when @xmath58=200 , the required magnetic field is much larger ( @xmath103000@xmath23 g ) .",
    "finally , from a comparison of the spectra obtained for slits n93 , s93 , and pa3 , we infer some differences in the kinematics of the different lobe components ( note that each lobe of crl618 consists of at least two well separated features , fig@xmath14[f2 ] ) . for example , the south sub - component of the east lobe ( better probed by slit s93 ) is expanding 5 - 20faster than the north one .",
    "similarly , the northern sub - feature of the west lobe ( better seen in slit n93 ) is 520  faster than the southern .",
    "these differences could be due to different absolute ejection velocities or inclinations of the lobe components .",
    "we note also that , in general , n93 and s93 provide similar fwhm for the west lobe but for the east lobe , the largest fwhm are measured from slit s93 , where the line fwhm reaches up to @xmath4180 .",
    "the larger widths in the southeast lobe sub - component are unlikely to be related to projection effects and must be due to intrinsic differences in the kinematics .      from the analysis of the h@xmath0 profile",
    "we can also obtain valuable information on the kinematics in regions of the crl618 nebula other than the shocked lobes .",
    "the presence of the blue - shifted , intense h@xmath0 emission component in the east lobe close to the nebula center ( feature a , fig@xmath14[f2 ] ) indicate ionized gas moving away at moderate velocity ( 15 - 30 ) from the central star .",
    "we have measured the velocity of this feature from the [ ] lines , which are less contaminated by scattered light ( note that the blue - shift of feature a in the h@xmath0 spectra is masked by superposition with the intense , red - shifted feature b and , probably also , c ) .",
    "the kinematics of the region can not be so straightforwardly obtained from our data , since the emission from this region is seen only after being reflected by the dust ( through features b and c ) and therefore the resulting line profile is affected by the distribution and kinematics of the dust .",
    "the fwhm of feature c , observed at the tip of the lobes ( fig@xmath14[f8 ] ) , and deconvolved with the spectral resolution of our data is @xmath460 , suggesting an expansion velocity for the gas in the region of @xmath430 .",
    "this figure has to be considered as an upper limit , since the reflecting dust could show a range of inclinations resulting from the opening angle of the lobes ( up to 15  according to the lobe aperture in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "our result is consistent with the low expansion velocity of the region measured from the profile of h radio recombination lines ( 20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the weak wings of feature b in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 lines extend up to lsr velocity @xmath4240  ( at a level of 5@xmath30 ) .",
    "such extended red - wings are most likely the result of the large velocities of the reflecting grains within the lobe ( up to @xmath4200 ) and also partially to the lobe opening angle , however , the presence of rapidly outflowing material in the region can not be ruled out .",
    "we have estimated the relative variation of the extinction along the lobes of crl618 by comparing the h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 spatial profiles along the axis ( from slit position n93 ) .",
    "the two long - slit spectra have been aligned in the direction of the slit using the west lobe brightest knot ( at the tip of the lobe ) as our spatial reference .",
    "we estimate that errors in the alignment are @xmath131 pixel ( @xmath1302 ) . the uncertainty in the positions of the slits used for obtaining the h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 spectra in the direction perpendicular to the slit is a few pixels and therefore , smaller than the seeing ( 16 ,  [ obsop ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution for both transitions and the adjacent continuum was obtained integrating our long - slit spectra in the spectral direction . in order to derive the balmer decrement ,",
    "the continuum emission was first subtracted from the h@xmath29 spatial profile but not from the much brighter h@xmath0 emission ( in this case , the continuum contribution is negligible , @xmath131% ) .    the spatial distribution of the extinction derived from the h@xmath0/h@xmath29 ratio is shown in fig@xmath14[f10 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "in this figure , the optical depth at 4861.3 , @xmath60 , has been calculated assuming the galactic reddening curve by @xcite and an intrinsic balmer decrement of 3 .",
    "this value of the balmer decrement allows easy comparison of our results with previous estimates of the extinction , which usually assume h@xmath0/h@xmath29=3 .",
    "moreover , the previous value is expected for high - velocity shocks like those in crl618  (  [ str+kin ] ) , for which the intrinsic balmer ratio approaches the recombination value ( collisional excitation increases the intrinsic balmer ratio only for low - velocity shocks , @xmath4370 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the conversion from @xmath60 to extinction in magnitudes in the @xmath51 band , @xmath60=0.93@xmath61 , has been derived using the extinction law parametrization by @xcite and assuming the ratio of total - to - selective absorption , @xmath62 , equal to 3.1 .",
    "the error - bars in fig@xmath14[f10 ] are statistical , and do not account for systematic errors ( e.g. arising from an incorrect value of the intrinsic balmer decrement , absolute flux calibration or small misalignments between the h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 spectra ) .",
    "the h@xmath0/h@xmath29 ratio clearly varies along the nebular axis ( fig@xmath14[f10 ] ) .",
    "this variation is most likely not due to a change of the intrinsic balmer ratio , since we do not expect the shock characteristics ( e.g@xmath14 shock speed and pre - shock density ) to vary sufficiently along the nebular axis .",
    "neither the velocity of the shocks nor the electron density show systematic variations along the lobes ( see  [ str+kin ] and  [ physical ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the observed variation of the h@xmath0/h@xmath29 ratio must be related to extinction by nebular dust .",
    "the nebular extinction varies along the axis of crl618  as follows : the maximum extinction is produced close to the nebular center and then gradually decreases towards the outermost parts of the lobes .",
    "the extinction in the innermost nebular regions is particularly uncertain and is very likely underestimated by a large factor .",
    "in fact , from the @xmath3 images we can see that the emission from the 2-region around the nebular center is well below the noise , suggesting a very high obscuration there ( see fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "we deduce that the extinction towards the central star of crl618  is @xmath61@xmath1010 magnitudes , given the upper limit to the stellar continuum level estimated from the r1200y spectra , @xmath132.5@xmath710@xmath63 , and the expected flux from a 30,000k black body , 2.5@xmath710@xmath64 .",
    "our low - resolution , ground - based h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 spectra , used to calculate the extinction , show some weak emission from the innermost nebular region . however , this is a result of the poor spatial resolution in these spectra , which spreads out some light from nearby nebular regions in the lobes ( where the extinction is smaller ) into the nebular center ( with , very likely , much larger extinction ) .",
    "the result is an underestimate of the extinction in these inner regions as deduced from the observed balmer decrement .    beyond the central region ,",
    "the extinction decreases with the distance from the nebular center reaching a relative minimum around offsets @xmath4@xmath265 . at offsets larger than @xmath27  ( beyond the tips of the lobes )",
    "the extinction increases again .",
    "we note that the extinction curve along the nebula is quite symmetric , i.e@xmath14 the extinction is similar for the east and west lobe : the weak west lobe appears on average only about 15% more extinguished than the bright east lobe .",
    "the difference is even smaller at the tip of the lobes .",
    "this result indicates that the lower h@xmath0 surface brightness for the west lobe compared to the east ( by a factor @xmath45 ) is intrinsic and not due ( at least totally ) to a much larger extinction of the receding lobe .",
    "in fact , most of the h@xmath0 emission from the east lobe arises from region a , which does not have a counterpart in the west lobe .",
    "the similar extinction for the east and west lobe is consistent with the similar brightness of both lobes for most forbidden lines ( e.g@xmath14 [ ] , [ ] , etc ) , for which the east lobe is only a factor @xmath41.5 brighter than the west lobe . finally , the similar extinctions derived for the east and west lobe suggest a low inclination of the nebular axis with respect to the plane of the sky ( assuming that most of the extinction is produced by the agb cse surrounding the lobes ,  [ intro ] ) , consistent with the value we derive from the analysis of the scattered h@xmath0 emission ( @xmath1@xmath424 ,  [ incli ] ) .",
    "our results on the extinction in crl618  are in good agreement with previous estimates using the balmer decrement method : @xcite derive an average extinction in the nebula of @xmath65=4.5@xmath20.2 , which is within the nebular extinction range derived by us ( fig@xmath14[f10 ] ) . from the analysis of [ ] @xmath316716,6731 and [ ] @xmath314069,4076 lines",
    ", these authors also found that both the east and west lobe have similar extinction values , @xmath65=2.1@xmath20.2mag and @xmath65=2.9@xmath20.3mag , respectively .",
    "the estimate of the absolute extinction along the line of sight from the balmer decrement in an object like crl618 is problematic mainly because of the contribution of scattered light to the total flux of the recombination lines , as already noticed by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the effects of such contribution on the value of the observed h@xmath0/h@xmath29 ratio are difficult to quantify : on the one hand , the scattering will produce an ` artificial ' decrease of the observed h@xmath0/h@xmath29 ratio due to the highest reflection efficiency for blue photons ; on the other hand , the extinction of the light from the innermost regions , where it originates , to the regions where it is scattered by the dust ( radial extinction ) will produce reddening which may or may not compensate the previous artificial increase of the h@xmath0/h@xmath29 ratio .",
    "the presence of nebular dust is expected to affect not only the absolute value of the extinction but also its relative variation from one region to another in the nebula . in regions where both local and scattered h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 emission are present , the optical depth derived from the balmer decrement , @xmath66 , is not only the line - of - sight or tangential optical thickness , @xmath67 ( from the lobes to the observer ) , as desired , but a complex function of @xmath67 , the radial optical depth , @xmath68 ( from the star up to the lobes where the light is being reflected ) , and the relative intensity of the balmer emission locally produced within the lobes and in the inner region .",
    "all these quantities will vary along the nebula in a different way and they will combine to yield the extinction profile in fig@xmath14[f10 ] .    at the tip of the crl618  east lobe ( and tentatively in the tip of the west lobe ) only h@xmath0 emission from feature c ( and `` c ? '' ) is observed , i.e@xmath14 the balmer emission is dominated by the scattered component ( fig@xmath14[f4 ] ) . in a region like this , where the local emission is negligible with respect to the scattered component , @xmath66 only depends on @xmath68 and @xmath67 in a relatively simple way :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the scattering optical thickness of the small region at the tip of the east lobe that produces feature c ( region c ; see fig@xmath14[f7 ] ) and the optical depths @xmath68 and @xmath67 include both scattering and absorption .",
    "this equation is valid if the scattering and aborption optical depths in region c are small ( @xmath711 ) , as expected beyond the tips of the lobes . in this case",
    ", @xmath72 is mostly due to foreground dust ( not directly illuminated by the central source ) between region c and the earth . using this equation",
    ", we analyze the spatial variation of the extinction in fig@xmath14[f10 ] to study the structure of the lobes . at the tips of , and beyond , the lobes ( offsets @xmath167 ) , the extinction increases with the distance from the nebular center ( fig@xmath14[f10 ] ) .",
    "this increase , which is not expected a priori given the progressive decrease of @xmath66 with distance for inner regions , can be explained if @xmath73 in this region , i.e. , if the radial extinction is larger than the tangential component . in fact , the tangential optical depth will decrease ( not increase ) with the distance from the central star in the plane of the sky , @xmath74 , for any reasonable density law for the outer circumstellar envelope ( e.g@xmath14 @xmath75 for a density law @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , the radial extinction is expected to increase with @xmath74 , as observed , for any reasonable density law within the lobes .",
    "we have computed the radial extinction as a function of the observed spatial offset , @xmath74=@xmath77@xmath78 , for two different density laws within the lobes of crl618 : ( i ) @xmath79 , which leads to @xmath80 ; and ( ii ) @xmath81 , which yields @xmath82 .",
    "the increasing extinction beyond offset + 7 , can be reproduced for both laws ( note that , in fact , for @xmath83 , the radial extinction @xmath68 in case i can be approximated by a straight line , which corresponds to case ii ) but always requires values of @xmath847 .",
    "( we will not discuss case ii further because @xmath85 best represents the density in most agb circumstellar envelopes . ) a small @xmath86 ( @xmath717 ) results in the extinction reaching a constant value ( @xmath87 ) very quickly ( fig@xmath14[f10 ] ) , which is inconsistent with the data .",

    "moreover , the intrinsic @xmath104 ratio is likely to be lower because the region beyond the lobe tips is overdense compared to the original , unshocked , agb cse ( since it contains material swept - up by the post - agb wind )",

    "to keep the temperature of the shocked gas above @xmath106@xmath10@xmath149k , the pulse period should be @xmath102yr .",
    "the idea of a pulsating fast wind is consistent with the presence of the multiple bright , bow - shaped and ripple - like structures seen along the lobes of crl618  ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) since their separations correspond to time - scales of @xmath410yr .",
    "finally , we have reported a recent increase ( decrease ) of the intensity of the [ ] @xmath55007([]@xmath56300 ) lines in crl618([fluxes ] ) .",
    "this change also provides indirect evidence for the presence of continuously evolving shocks resulting from a continuous interaction between the ongoing post - agb wind and the surrounding media . since shocks are the main excitation mechanism of the gas in the lobes of crl618 , where most of the forbidden line emission is detected , the observed [ ] brightening probably has its origin in a change of the shock properties ( rather than in the stellar radiation ) .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath29 ratio is very sensitive to the shock velocity ( hrh87 ) and therefore , the recent increase of the [ ] flux may indicate that the ongoing shocks are faster now than 10 years ago .",
    "as a consequence of the shock acceleration the ionization fraction of the lobes could have increased , leading to a weakening of the [ ] lines .",
    "the increasing velocity of the shocks could point to acceleration of the stellar post - agb wind .",
    "the time scale of the [ ] / [ ] brightening / weakening ( observed over @xmath1610yr ) is consistent with the expected shock velocity and the size of the shocked - gas emitting region : a 90 - 200  shock will cross the 01-wide lobe walls ( @xmath41.3@xmath710@xmath150 cm ) in only 4.7 - 2.1yr",
    ".      the shocked optical lobes of crl618  could evolve into a fast , bipolar molecular outflow if the time scale of molecular reformation in the shocked gas is smaller than the time required by the expanding ionization front ( produced by the central star ) to reach and fully ionize the whole nebula .",
    "the present radiative , forward shocks will continue propagating through the molecular cocoon ( traced by co ) , accelerating and shaping more and more material of the agb cse .",
    "we are observing the beginning of this process , when the shocked material is still hot ( and , therefore , primarily visible in the optical ) , and its mass is still low compared to that of the unshocked envelope .",
    "the hot shocked material will cool down , allowing molecule reformation , and would be observed as an extended , bipolar outflow moving at high velocity .",
    "this is what presumably already happened to a part of the shocked material : the fast molecular bipolar outflow observed in the innermost parts of crl618 (  [ intro ] , discussed in detail in snchez contreras et al@xmath14 2002  paper ii , in preparation ) .",
    "if the shocks have sufficient energy to accelerate most of the agb envelope , the mass of the future fast , bipolar outflow of crl618 could be a significant fraction of the total mass of the agb cse , @xmath41.5 .",
    "the interaction of this fast and massive molecular jet with the interstellar medium or the low density , outermost parts of the crl618 cse could also lead to new shocks that would be observed , in their first stages , through optical line emission surrounding the molecular bipolar outflow .    in our opinion ,",
    "the possible future evolution of crl618  described above is what already occurred in another well studied protoplanetary nebula , oh231.8 + 4.2 .",
    "this object shows a very collimated and fast molecular outflow which was presumably shaped and accelerated by radiative shocks resulting from a two - wind interaction process @xmath41000yr ago @xcite ; this outflow should have been in the past a very intense emitter of recombination and forbidden lines at short wavelengths , as the optical lobes in crl618 . surrounding the collimated molecular outflow of oh231.8 + 4.2",
    ", there is a wide bow - shaped nebula of shock - excited warm gas which is observed in the visible @xcite .",
    "this component is believed to result from the hydrodynamical interaction between the bipolar co outflow and the tenuous circumstellar material , the shocks generated in this interaction being more likely in an adiabatic regime .",
    "the central star of oh231.8 + 4.2 is still very cool ( @xmath42500k ) and therefore is not able to ionize the circumstellar material .",
    "the evolution of the optical lobes of crl618  into a fast molecular outflow ( like in oh231.8 + 4.2 ) in the future requires that once the wind interaction stops , the time required by the ionization front , produced by the hot central star , to reach the lobes ( @xmath151 ) be larger than the molecular reformation time scale ( @xmath152 ) .    in the relatively dense envelopes of ppne ,",
    "the time scale for molecule formation is @xmath131000yr , as deduced from the widespread existence of fast ( @xmath153100 ) molecular outflows with kinematical ages @xmath1310@xmath8yr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : note that molecules are totally destroyed by shocks at speeds @xmath1630",
    "@xcite and therefore molecules moving at such high velocities have most likely been reformed in the post - shock gas .",
    "the kinematical age of the compact molecular outflow of crl618  itself , moving at @xmath16100 , is only of the order of 10@xmath154yr (  [ intro ] ) , so , in general , we can expect molecule reformation to occur in @xmath152@xmath410@xmath154 - 10@xmath8yr .",
    "this value is also in reasonable agreement with theoretical estimates of @xmath155 in dense , @xmath130@xmath410@xmath183 , post - shock gas @xcite .",
    "the time required by the ionization front to reach the lobes , @xmath151 , depends on the relative expansion velocity of the front and the lobes .",
    "the expansion velocity of the ionization front in crl618 , estimated from radio continuum mapping with high - angular resolution in different epochs , has decreased with time : from 50 - 74(@xmath112/0.9kpc )  @xcite to 26(@xmath112/0.9kpc)@xcite .",
    "expanding at this rate , the ionization front will never reach the lobes , which are moving much faster ( up to 200 ) , and the molecules will reform in the shocked gas sooner or later . if the shocked lobes are decelerated by interaction with the surrounding circumstellar gas and/or the velocity of the ionization front increases ( due , e.g. , to the evolution of the central star , which will become hotter and hotter , and the dilution of the circumstellar gas ) then the uv stellar photons will be able to fully ionize the lobes of crl618 .",
    "the ionization time - scale depends on different unknown physical parameters of the central star , such as mass , temperature , mass - loss rate , etc , and their evolution with time .",
    "the shocked gas would be observed as a molecular outflow during @xmath156 , whenever @xmath157 , otherwise crl618  will never develop a massive bipolar molecular outflow ( like e.g@xmath14 oh231.8 + 4.2 ) .",
    "we have obtained ground - based , long - slit spectra in the ranges [ 6233 - 6806]  and [ 4558 - 5331]  for three different ( 1-wide ) slit positions in the ppn crl618 . based on the analysis of these spectra and direct ( h@xmath0 and continuum ) images , we find the following results :    @xmath32 the balmer line emission results from the superposition of unscattered and scattered components . the unscattered emission is locally produced in the shocked lobes and in a inner , compact region labeled a ( fig@xmath14[f1 ] ) .",
    "the scattered radiation originates in the central region ( and also maybe in region a ) and is reflected by the dust in the shocked lobes and in the unshocked agb envelope .",
    "most forbidden lines are entirely produced in the lobes but there is also forbidden line emission ( e.g@xmath14 [ ] and [ ] ) arising in the region and region a. @xmath32 we identify the wolf - rayet bump at @xmath46540  superimposed on the scattered continuum .",
    "this bump , and a number of high - excitation transitions such as , e.g. , @xmath54686 , originate in the dense ( @xmath105@xmath410@xmath42 - 10@xmath1433 ) inner region , and are seen after being reflected by the nebular dust .",
    "@xmath32 the spectrum of region a is similar to that of the inner region ( dominated by high - excitation lines ) but remarkably different from the spectrum of the shocked lobes ( dominated by low - excitation lines ) , and is consistent with @xmath6@xmath410@xmath9 - 10@xmath423 and full ionization in this region .",
    "thus , region a very likely represents the outermost parts of the central region , i.e@xmath14 it is gas ionized by the uv stellar radiation rather than by shocks .",
    "@xmath32 the shock velocity derived from the profiles of line emission arising in the shocked lobes is @xmath16200 .",
    "however , the line ratios in the lobes are consistent with the predictions of bow - shock models with a lower shock velocity ( less than about 90 , and probably @xmath475 ) .",
    "@xmath32 we have measured an increase ( decrease ) of the [ ] @xmath55007  ( [ ] @xmath56300 ) line flux by a factor @xmath42.5 ( 0.7 ) with respect to observations performed @xmath410yr ago .",
    "such variations could be due to a recent increase of the shock velocity .",
    "@xmath32 the material in the lobes of crl618  is moving away from the star at velocities up to @xmath4200 .",
    "the projected velocity of the gas shows a non - linear radial variation , resulting in a kinematical age that varies from @xmath4100yr near the nebular center to @xmath4400yr at the tips , without correcting projection effects . for a mean inclination of @xmath1=24 , the kinematical age of the optical lobes",
    "is @xmath13180yr .",
    "@xmath32 the extinction along the nebula is found to decrease from the center ( a@xmath158@xmath1010mag ) to the lobe tips ( @xmath42mag ) ; beyond the bright optical lobes , where an h@xmath0 scattered halo is visible , the extinction increases again .",
    "this increase indicates a large density contrast between the dust inside the optical lobes and beyond them , i.e@xmath14 in the agb cse unaltered by the shocks .",
    "this result is consistent with the lobes of crl618  being cavities in the agb cse excavated by post - agb winds .",
    "@xmath32 the electron density , with mean values @xmath6@xmath4[5 - 8]@xmath710@xmath8 and @xmath48@xmath710@xmath8 - 10@xmath93 , for the east and west lobe , respectively , shows no systematic variation along the lobes .",
    "@xmath32 the ionization fraction in the lobes is x@xmath40.03 - 0.1 , derived by comparison of different line ratios with predictions from planar shocks models . the total number density in the lobes is then @xmath410@xmath42 - 10@xmath183 .    @xmath32 the mass of atomic gas in the east ( west ) lobe is @xmath101.3@xmath710@xmath11  ( @xmath107.0@xmath710@xmath12 ) .",
    "the masses of ionized gas in the lobes are smaller : @xmath46@xmath710@xmath12 , for the east lobe , and @xmath44@xmath710@xmath12  for the western lobe .",
    "the ionized mass in region a is comparable to the ionized mass in the lobes or even higher , up to @xmath410@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath32 the limb brightening of the optical lobes and the lack of a systematic spatial gradient in @xmath105 suggest that most of the line emission arises in a thin shell of shocked material rather than in gas filling the interior of the lobes .",
    "the thin - shell geometry is expected from radiative shocks shaping and accelerating the agb circumstellar envelope .",
    "the radiative nature of the shocks is inferred from the short cooling time of the immediate post - shock gas , @xmath130.04yr ( relative to the dynamical time ) .",
    "@xmath32 the post - agb wind is probably currently active , shocking and heating the agb circumstellar material , since the time required for the gas in the shocked lobes ( presently partially ionized ) to cool down significantly below 10@xmath9k is @xmath132yr , much shorter than the age of the nebula .",
