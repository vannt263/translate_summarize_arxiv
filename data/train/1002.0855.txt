    "aloha is one of the most common examples of a multiple access protocol @xcite .",
    "the classical approach to aloha adopts simplified packet collision models in which simultaneous transmissions are never successful .",
    "this makes this classical approach not well adapted to a wireless manet scenario , where it is the sinrs at different receiver locations which determine the set of successful transmissions .",
    "the present paper contributes to the study of spatial aloha , a variant of aloha well adapted to manets .",
    "more precisely , it bears on the mathematical analysis of spatial aloha in the context of large mobile ad hoc network ( manets ) with randomly located nodes .",
    "it focuses on the sinr coverage scheme , where each transmission requires that the receiver be covered by the transmitter with a minimum sinr .",
    "the present paper uses the stochastic geometry approach proposed in @xcite where the _ space - time density of successful transmissions _ was evaluated and optimized .",
    "the present paper identifies a potential weakness of this sinr coverage scheme : in most practical cases , and in particular as soon as thermal noise is bounded from below by a positive constant , the mean delay for a typical node to transmit a packet is infinite e.g. in the rayleigh fading case .",
    "the main _ modeling advances _ of the present paper are two - fold :    * we add a _ time dimension _ to the existing spatial analysis .",
    "time is slotted , and we hence focus on slotted aloha .",
    "we assume that the geographical locations of the manet nodes remain unchanged over time and that only the variables modeling the mac status ( allowed to transmit or delayed ) and the channel characteristics ( such as fading and thermal noise ) vary over time .",
    "in other words , we consider a full separation of the time scale of node mobility on one side and the time scale of mac and physical layer on the other side , which makes sense in many practical situations , where the former is much larger than the later .",
    "this is in contrast with what happens in delay tolerant networks ( dtns ) ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "* we propose some more _ realistic receiver models _ than the fixed - distance receiver model introduced in @xcite ; the new models are inspired by the fact that the routing schemes typically choose , as next - hop , the closest possible receiver among some common set of potential receivers .    the main theoretical advances of the paper bear on the analysis of the _ local delays _ in such manets ; the local delay of a node is the random numbers of slots required by this node to successfully transmit a packet to its next - hop node .",
    "we first perform a time analysis of these local delays given the location of the manet nodes .",
    "this analysis shows that each node has finite - mean geometric conditional random delay and thus a positive throughput to its next - hop receiver .",
    "however , the spatial irregularities of the network imply that these conditional throughputs vary from node to node ; in a poisson configuration , one can find nodes which have an arbitrarily small throughput and consequently an arbitrarily large delay . in order to capture the performance of the whole manet",
    ", one usually considers its `` typical node '' .",
    "the typical node statistics are spatial ( or large population ) averages of the individual node characteristics .",
    "our analysis shows in several practical cases , including the rayleigh fading and positive thermal noise case , that the local delay of the typical manet node is heavy tailed and that its mean is infinite , which however does _ not _ imply that the mean throughput of the typical node is null .",
    "moreover , in certain cases , the mean local delay of the typical node exhibit a phase transition phenomenon that we propose to call the _ wireless contention phase transition _ : it is finite when certain model parameters ( as receiver distance , thermal noise , aloha medium access probability ) are below a threshold and infinite above .    on the theory side",
    ", we also comment on the connections between the heavy tailedness alluded to the local delay of the typical manet node and the observations of @xcite , where it was shown that a finite population aloha model with variable and unbounded size packets has power law transmission delays .",
    "although the physical phenomena at hand are quite different here ( our spatial manet model has fixed - packet - sizes ) and there , we use the so - called `` restart algorithm phenomenon '' , which has recently received a lot of attention ( see e.g.",
    "@xcite ) , to establish some links between our findings and the results of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we argue that , in our spatial manet model with fixed - packet - size aloha mac , the delay of the typical node is heavy tailed and can have infinite mean due to a `` restart '' phenomenon , where the _ spatial irregularities in the manet _ play the same role as the packet size variability in @xcite and @xcite .    the main practical contributions of the paper bear on ways to guarantee finite mean local delay of the typical node by _ increasing diversity _ in the manet .",
    "the proposed solutions have the potential of breaking the restart rigidity , e.g. by increasing the variability of fading , by increasing mobility , by adding appropriate receivers or , finally , by using adaptive coding , which completely brakes out the outage / restart logic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the remaining part of this section",
    "we briefly present the related work .",
    "we present our manet model in section  [ s.manet ] .",
    "the mean local delays are introduced and evaluated in section  [ s.theld ] .",
    "we analyze the phase - transition phenomenon in section  [ s.phase-transition ] .",
    "section  [ s.finitemean ] focuses on the ways to make the mean delays finite .",
    "we conclude our work in section  [ s.conclusion ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the present paper assumes a full time - scale separation for the mobility on one side and for the mac and physical layer on the other side .",
    "this assumption makes a major difference between what is done in this paper and what is done in dtns , where one leverages node mobility to contribute to the transport of packets .",
    "there is a large number of publications on the throughput in dtns and we will not review the literature on the topic which is huge .",
    "let us nevertheless stress that there are some interesting connections between the line of though started in ( @xcite ) , where it was first shown that mobility increases capacity and what is done in section  [ secalo : hmn ] .",
    "we show in this section that mobility helps in a way which is quite different from that considered in @xcite : mobility may in certain cases break dependence and hence mitigate the restart phenomenon , it may hence decrease the mean local delay of the typical node ( or equivalently increase its throughput ) , even if one _ does not use mobility to transport packets_.    among recent papers , that we are aware of , on the time - space analysis of manets , we would quote @xcite and @xcite . the former focuses on node motion alone and assumes that nodes within transmission range can transmit packets instantaneously .",
    "the authors then study the speed at which some multicast information propagates on a poisson manet where nodes have independent motion ( of the random walk or random way - point type ) .",
    "the latter focuses on a first passage percolation problem , however , the model used in @xcite is the so called protocol model ; its analysis significantly differs from that of our physical ( sinr - based ) model . in particular",
    ", there is no notion of local delay .",
    "[ s.manet ]      in what follows we describe a few space - time models considered in this paper . in the most simple case this will consist in adding the time - dimension to the poisson bipolar model introduced and studied in  @xcite .",
    "we will go however beyond the simple receiver model proposed there .",
    "the idea consists in assuming that the geographical locations of the manet nodes remain unchanged over time and that the mac status ( allowed to transmit or delayed ) and other characteristics of each node ( as fading and thermal noise ) vary over time .",
    "time is discrete with a sequence of _ time slots _ , @xmath0 , w.r.t . which all the nodes are perfectly synchronized .",
    "more precisely , we assume that a snapshot of the manet can be represented by a marked poisson point process ( p.p.p . ) on the euclidean plane , where the point process is homogeneous with intensity @xmath1 and represents the random locations of the nodes and where the multidimensional mark of a point / node carries information about its mac status and other characteristics of the channels in the successive time slots .",
    "this marked poisson p.p .",
    "is denoted by @xmath2 , where :    * @xmath3 denotes the _ locations of the potential transmitters _ of the manet ; @xmath4 is always assumed poisson with positive and finite intensity @xmath1 ; * [ i.ei ] @xmath5 is the _ mac decision _ of point @xmath6 of @xmath4 at time @xmath7 ; we will always assume that , given @xmath4 , the random variables @xmath8 are i.i.d . in @xmath9 and @xmath7 ;",

    "* and  501 ) ) .",
    "however , one also consider also non exponential cases to analyze other types of fading such as e.g. rician or nakagami scenarios ( cf  ( * ? ? ?",
    "23.2.4 ) ) or simply the case without fading ( when @xmath21 is deterministic ) .",
