    "the recent experimental realization of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honey - comb lattice has prompted much excitement and activity in both the experimental and theoretical physics communities @xcite .",
    "carriers in graphene ( both electrons and holes ) have a linear bare kinetic energy dispersion spectra around the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points ( the  dirac points \" ) of the brillouin zone . the ability of experimentalists to tune the chemical potential to lie above or below the dirac point energy ( by application of voltages to gates in close proximity to the graphene sheets ) allows the carriers to be changed from electrons to holes in the same sample .",
    "this sets graphene apart from other two dimensional ( 2d ) carrier systems that have a parabolic dispersion relation , and typically have only one set of carriers , i.e. either electrons or holes .",
    "another unique electronic property , the absence of back - scattering , has led to the speculation that carrier mobilities of 2d graphene monolayers ( certainly at room temperature , but also at low temperature ) could be made to be much higher than any other field - effect type device , suggesting great potential both for graphene to be the successor to si - mosfet ( metal - oxide - semicondcutor field effect transistor ) devices and for the discovery of new phenomena that normally accompanies any significant increase in carrier mobility @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of considerable fundamental and technological interest to understand the electronic properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "graphene samples that are currently being fabricated are far from pure , based on the relatively low electronic mobilities compared to epitaxially grown modulation - doped two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) such as gaas - algaas quantum wells .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the effects of disorder on the properties of graphene .",
    "disorder manifests itself in the finite lifetimes of electronic eigenstates of the pure system . in the presence of scattering from an impurity potential that is not diagonal in the these eigenstates ,",
    "the lifetime scattering rate of the eigenstate , @xmath3 , is non - zero and can be measured experimentally by fitting the line - shape of the low - field shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations . @xcite the effect of disorder scattering on the sdh line shape is equivalent to increasing the sample temperature and one can therefore measure this dingle temperature ( @xmath4 ) and relate it to the single - particle lifetime through @xmath5 . to avoid potential confusion , we mention that the lifetime damping rate @xmath3 discussed in this paper is _ not _ equal to the _ transport _ scattering rate which governs the electrical conductivity .",
    "the lifetime damping rate is the measure of the rate at which particles scatters out of an eigenstate , whereas the transport scattering rate is a measure of the rate of _ current decay _ due to scattering out of an eigenstate . in normal 2degs",
    ", the transport scattering time can be much larger than the impurity induced lifetime @xmath6 , particularly in high mobility modulation doped 2d systems where the charged impurities are placed very far from the 2deg@xcite .",
    "recently , the issue of transport scattering time versus impurity scattering lifetime in graphene has been discussed.@xcite    the single - particle level broadening due to the impurity potential changes many of the physical properties of the system including the electronic density of states.@xcite the electronic density of states is an important property which directly affects many experimentally measurable quantities such as the electrical conductivity , thermoelectric effects , and differential conductivity in tunneling experiments between graphene and scanning - tunneling microscope tips or other electron gases .",
    "changes in the density of states also modify the electron screening,@xcite which is an important factor in the determination of various properties of graphene .",
    "it is therefore imperative to take into account the effects of disorder on the density of states , particularly since disorder is quite strong in currently available graphene samples .    in the present work ,",
    "we present calculations of the average density of states of disordered graphene .",
    "this problem has been investigated using various models and techniques , both analytical and numerical.@xcite we take into account scattering effects from long - range and short range impurity potentials .",
    "we consider both unscreened and screened short - ranged and screened charged impurities , using the born approximation .",
    "in addition , for unscreened short - ranged ( usr ) impurities , we go beyond the born approximation and include self - consistent effects .",
    "there is another class of disorder in graphene called  off - diagonal \" or ",
    "random gauge potential \" disorder , in which the hopping matrix elements of the electrons in the underlying honeycomb lattice are random . in this paper",
    "we do not consider in this type of disorder , which can result from height fluctuations ( ripples ) in the graphene sheet and lead to qualitatively different results from the ones presented in this paper.@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "( in their work , they did not absorb the shift in the band due to the impurity potential in their definition of the energy , so the dirac point had a shift @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the concentration of impurities and @xmath203 is the on - site impurity energy . ) their numerical results for the minimum in the average density of states ( fig .",
    "3(b ) in ref .  ) seem to indicate a non - linear dependence of the value of the minimum as a function of the strength of the disorder potential , and is at least not inconsistent with eq .",

    "the issue of the effect of screening of the impurity interactions on the density of states discussed in section iv , to the best of our knowledge has not yet been treated in the literature .",
    "qualitatively , the effect of screened impurities away from the dirac point is the increase the density of states , and is consistent with numerical results for random on - site disorder.@xcite ( since our treatment of screened impurities is at the level of the born approximation , we do not obtain either a non - zero density of states at the dirac point nor resonances in the density of states.@xcite )",
    "we have calculated the density of states for disordered graphene . in the case of unscreened short - ranged impurities",

    "only the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation gave a non - zero density of states at the dirac point , and the density of states is a non - analytic function of the impurity potential .",
    "we investigated the density of states in the case of screened short - ranged and charged impurity potentials at the level of the born approximation .",
    "we find that , unlike the case of parabolic band 2degs , in graphene near the band - edge ( _ i.e. _ , the dirac point ) the density of states is enhanced by impurities instead of being suppressed . at very low carrier densities , however , graphene develops strong carrier density inhomogeneity in the presence of charged impurities , an effect not captured by the homogeneous many - body theory in our description .",
