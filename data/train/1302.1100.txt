    "we have studied the equilibrium link and spin overlap distributions ( defined below , eqs .   and ) in some detail for ising spin glasses ( isgs ) on [ hyper]cubic lattices with bimodal and gaussian near neighbor interaction distributions in dimension five and with bimodal near neighbor interactions in dimension four .",
    "the hamiltonian is as usual @xmath3 with the near neighbor symmetric bimodal ( @xmath4 ) or gaussian interaction distributions normalized to @xmath5 . throughout",
    "we will quote inverse temperatures @xmath6 .",
    "the link overlap parameter @xcite in isg numerical simulations is the bond analogue of the intensively studied spin overlap . in both cases two replicas ( copies ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the same physical system are first generated and equilibrated ; updating is then continued and the `` overlaps '' between the two replicas are recorded over long time intervals .",
    "the spin overlap at any instant @xmath9 corresponds to the fraction @xmath10 of spins in @xmath7 and @xmath8 having the same orientation ( both up or both down ) , and the normalized overall distribution over time is written @xmath11 .",
    "the link overlap corresponds to the fraction @xmath12 of links ( or bonds or edges ) between spins which are either both satisfied or both dissatisfied in the two replicas ; the normalized overall distribution over time is written @xmath13 .",
    "the explicit definitions are for the spin overlap @xmath14 and for the link overlap @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of spins per sample and @xmath17 the number of links ; near neighbor spins @xmath18 and @xmath19 are linked , as denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "we will indicate means taken over time for a given sample by @xmath21 and means over sets of samples by @xmath22 .",
    "the physical distinction between the information obtained from @xmath11 and @xmath13 is frequently illustrated in terms of a low temperature domain picture @xcite .",
    "`` overlap equivalence '' has been proved in @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of the link overlaps in isgs has not been studied before , as far as we are aware .",
    "it turns out that the moments and moment ratios of the link overlap distributions have characteristic forms as functions of temperature around @xmath23 and that these data can be used to supplement and improve on information from spin overlap measurements .",
    "it is widely considered to be self - evident that just as the standard universality rules hold exactly at ferromagnetic ordering transitions , they should hold also for isg transitions .",
    "early exponent estimates were erratic ( see a summary in ref .",
    "recent careful comparisons between the critical exponent estimates for bimodal and gaussian interaction distribution isgs have indeed concluded that both in @xmath24d @xcite and in @xmath2d @xcite the exponents for the two systems are the same to within numerical precision .",
    "high temperature series expansion ( htse ) analyses also concluded that the estimates for the exponent @xmath0 for different isgs were compatible with universality to within the precision of the method @xcite .",
    "however , the application of the standard universality rules to isgs has been questioned on the basis of dynamic simulations @xcite and it is relevant that the critical exponents in @xmath24d heisenberg spin glasses have been shown experimentally to depend on the strength of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya anisotropy @xcite , and so are not universal .",
    "the present simulation results concern isgs in the high dimensions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where independent information from htse can be used in conjunction with the numerical data .",
    "once accurate values of ordering temperatures have been obtained using information from a combination of spin overlap , link overlap and htse data , the critical exponent @xmath0 can readily be estimated from the temperature variation of the spin glass susceptibility in the paramagnetic state . the data presented below show that in the same dimension , bimodal and gaussian isgs have different values for @xmath0 , so the standard simple universality rules are not obeyed .",
    "the spin glass susceptibility is defined by @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the spin overlap eqn .  .",
    "the standard binder cumulant criterion which is widely used to estimate the ordering temperature @xmath23 in isgs consists of the observation of intersections of mean spin overlap kurtosis curves as functions of temperature for different sample sizes @xmath28 .",
    "we use `` @xmath29 kurtosis '' eqn .   to specify the kurtosis of the spin overlap distribution to distinguish it from the kurtosis of the link overlap distribution , the `` @xmath30 kurtosis '' eqn .  . a mean @xmath29 kurtosis",
    "can be defined either as @xmath31 which we will use here , or alternatively @xmath32 which is the definition more frequently used .",
    "@xmath29 kurtosis data are generally expressed in terms of the binder cumulant @xmath33 .",
    "one drawback to this procedure for estimating @xmath23 is that the inter - sample variability of @xmath34 and _ a fortiori _ of @xmath35 are strong at @xmath23 in isgs .",
    "the normalized variation of the isg susceptibility ( the non - self - averaging parameter ) @xmath36 is typically about @xmath37 at @xmath23 @xcite , and results on large numbers of samples must be recorded at each size to overcome statistical fluctuations in the mean @xmath29 kurtosis .",
    "there are in general finite size corrections so @xmath38 with prefactor @xmath39 and exponent @xmath40 which are _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "delicate extrapolation to infinite @xmath28 is required to estimate the thermodynamic limit critical temperature . to obtain the intersection point of curves @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "it is necessary to equilibrate samples up to the larger size @xmath43 while the position of the intersection point is affected mainly by the larger finite size correction of the smaller size @xmath28 .    as well as",
    "higher order moment ratios , there are other dimensionless parameters of the spin overlap distributions which also can be studied , if the one - sided distributions of the absolute value of the spin overlap @xmath44 are recorded .",
    "these include the second moment ratio @xmath45 the mean skewness of the absolute spin overlap distribution @xmath46 and the mean kurtosis of the absolute spin overlap distribution @xmath47    it turns out that the first two moment ratio parameters are of the standard phenomenological coupling form ; at @xmath48 each takes up a standard value corresponding to that of a one - sided gaussian , and then decreases towards a low value at high @xmath49 . as functions of @xmath49 at fixed @xmath28 , at @xmath23 to leading order the curves go through a size - independent critical value and have a maximum slope @xmath50_{c}$ ] whose value increases as @xmath51 .",
    "the parameters generally show finite size corrections . on the other hand data on the novel parameter @xmath52 defined by eqn",
    ".   shows a deep dip as a function of temperature for each @xmath28 . with increasing @xmath28",
    "the dip narrows and the position of the minimum is tending towards @xmath23 subject to a weak finite size correction .",
    "@xmath52 behaves in quite different ways in the isgs and in the ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this spin overlap based parameter is obviously a useful supplementary measurement for estimating critical temperatures .",
    "we will not discuss here the correlation length ratio @xmath53 which is a widely used phenomenological coupling parameter independent of the spin overlap distribution .",
    "turning to the link overlaps , for the gaussian isg it has been shown @xcite that in equilibrium @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mean energy per bond .",
    "the @xmath1d gaussian isg data presented here satisfy this equilibrium condition over the full temperature range used ; the bimodal samples equilibrated faster than the gaussian ones and were equilibrated for as long times so we will consider that for present purposes effective equilibration has usually been reached .",
    "however , the data show that the condition eqn .",
    "is necessary but is not stringent enough to guarantee true equilibration .",
    "a stricter and more general condition , which can be applied whatever the interaction distribution , is that all spin overlap or link overlap parameters for each individual sample should vary smoothly with temperature . by inspection of the individual sample data",
    "sets it can be seen if and when the equilibrium condition begins to break down as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this test shows that for the same @xmath28 some samples equilibrate more easily than others , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite . what has not been remarked on",
    "is that `` simple '' samples , where the spin overlap distribution is tending to two pure peaks beyond the ordering transition and @xmath56 is high , equilibrate more easily than `` complex '' samples , those for which the spin overlap distribution remains multi - peaked and @xmath56 is low even at low temperatures .    for the symmetric bimodal isg",
    "there are simple rules on the mean link overlap @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath57 is the probability that a bond is satisfied , by definition @xmath58 and for symmetric interaction distributions where the nishimori point is at @xmath59 ( uncorrelated satisfied bond positions ) a strict lower limit on @xmath56 is given by @xmath60 in the high temperature limit @xmath61 so @xmath62 .",
    "as @xmath49 increases @xmath63 drops and appears to tend gradually towards @xmath64 .    for a pure near neighbor ferromagnet ( so with translational invariance )",
    "@xmath65 at all temperatures @xcite . for the bimodal isg",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath64 for small @xmath49 but then gradually grows as @xmath49 increases and certain bonds become preferentially satisfied .",
    "certain moments and moment ratios for the link overlap distributions @xmath13 show characteristic critical behavior in the isgs , as they do in a ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "link overlap data for a given @xmath49 and @xmath28 can be recorded for virtually no extra computational cost in a simulation designed for spin overlap measurements , while the inter - sample variability of the link overlap distributions at @xmath23 is considerably weaker than that of the spin overlap distributions .",
    "this implies that measurements on mean link overlap values require far fewer samples than those on mean spin overlap values , or alternatively that with the same number of samples the mean link overlap measurements are more precise than the mean spin overlap measurements .",
    "thus link overlap based data are more efficient for obtaining accurate estimates of critical temperatures , and so of critical exponents , than are spin overlap data .    as well as the mean link overlap @xmath66 , and the variance of the link overlap @xmath67 we have recorded three dimensionless moment ratios for each sample and their averages over all samples .",
    "these are the @xmath30 kurtosis @xmath68 the @xmath30 skewness @xmath69 and @xmath70 which is the mean squared signal to noise ratio , or the mean of the inverse square of the coefficient of variation .",
    "this has a clumsy name but a simple definition : @xmath71 as we will see , its derivative with respect to @xmath49 has a minimum which location is very close to @xmath23 . finally , the quantity @xmath72 is defined as the squared ratio of the mean deviation and the standard deviation ( thus a relative of @xmath73 above ) i.e. @xmath74 obviously @xmath72 can only be found by storing the actual distributions @xmath13 for individual samples during simulation rather than just the raw moments .    at high temperatures ,",
    "i.e. @xmath75 , for both bimodal and gaussian isg interactions the @xmath13 distributions become symmetric , gaussian , and centered on @xmath76 , so @xmath77 . as @xmath49 is increased through @xmath23 the @xmath13 distributions become fat tailed and asymmetric , so @xmath78 and @xmath79 show peaks in the region of @xmath23",
    ".    the amplitudes of the peaks decrease with increasing @xmath28 ; this could be called an `` evanescent '' critical phenomenon as it will disappear in the thermodynamic limit . allowing for a weak finite size correction term ,",
    "the positions of the maxima @xmath80 for each set of peaks tend towards @xmath23 with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "physically , the peaks in the excess @xmath30 kurtosis ( `` fat tailed '' distributions ) and the @xmath30 skewness near @xmath23 in isgs must be related to the build up of inhomogeneous temporary correlated spin clusters around criticality .",
    "the data show that these clusters do not produce a visible effect on the form of the @xmath13 distribution until @xmath28 is smaller than the thermodynamic correlation length @xmath81 , which is related to the typical cluster size . for larger @xmath28",
    "the cluster effects average out in @xmath13 .",
    "only when the ratio @xmath82 is smaller than some value so that a cluster can englobe the entire sample do deviations from the gaussian form appear . as @xmath81 diverges at @xmath83 , the @xmath30 kurtosis and the @xmath30 skewness will each tend to a peak for fixed @xmath28 , and the peaks can be expected to be situated exactly at @xmath23 in the large @xmath28 limit .",
    "indeed analogous behavior can be observed in a pure ising ferromagnet , with excess @xmath30 kurtosis and @xmath30 skewness peak positions tending towards @xmath23 with increasing @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath84 and @xmath85 parameters are closely related as @xmath86 becomes almost independent of @xmath28 at large @xmath28 .",
    "we will show data for @xmath87 and @xmath85 .",
    "both of these parameters have basically the form of a phenomenological coupling , with curves for different @xmath28 intersecting at crossing points @xmath88 which approach @xmath23 as @xmath28 and @xmath43 are increased .",
    "the corrections to scaling for the two parameters are slightly different .",
    "as the inter - sample variability for these parameters is much weaker in the region of @xmath23 than is the equivalent variability for the phenomenological couplings based on spin overlap distributions , they provide an accurate tool for estimations of the critical temperature .",
    "the thermodynamic limit spin glass susceptibility including the wegner confluent correction to scaling term @xcite is @xmath89 with the natural isg scaling variable @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the analogous correlation length expression is @xcite @xmath91 with the same exponent @xmath92 .",
    "( unfortunately isg susceptibility and correlation length data are most frequently analyzed using the scaling variable @xmath93 which is inappropriate for isgs except as an approximation in a narrow region around the critical point . )",
    "once the value of @xmath23 can be considered to be precisely determined , a further step is to make a plot of the temperature dependent effective exponent @xmath94 @xcite from the spin glass susceptibility data @xmath95 , with the definition @xmath96 and the temperature dependent effective exponent @xmath97 can be defined by @xmath98 in a [ hyper]cubic lattice , from the second term in the isg htse the limiting effective exponent at infinite temperature @xmath99 exactly , where @xmath100 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the ratio @xmath101 is directly related to the strength and sign of the confluent correction coefficient @xmath102 .",
    "if the remaining correction terms are negligible , then to leading order @xmath103 which gives a criterion for the strength and sign of the confluent correction to scaling term ( but not for the value of the exponent @xmath92 ) once @xmath83 and @xmath104 have been estimated .",
    "as long as @xmath105 the finite size numerical data are @xmath28 independent and so are effectively in the thermodynamic limit infinite size regime . the region where this condition holds for each @xmath28 can be seen by inspection of @xmath106 and other parameters such as @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath108 can be readily evaluated by direct summation of the terms given in ref .",
    "@xcite , from small @xmath49 down to some @xmath49 beyond which the contribution of further terms of greater than @xmath109th order become non - negligible . these htse data can be used as a check on the numerical data ; in all cases agreement was good .",
    "then from eqn .   one can plot @xmath110 and @xmath111    luckily , according to @xcite for the systems studied @xmath92 is of the order of or a little greater than @xmath64 , so the leading and subleading corrections have about the same exponent .",
    "an adequate analysis can be made using a joint effective correction term with a single effective @xmath92 .",
    "then extrapolation to criticality at @xmath112 can be made by first estimating the parameters @xmath113 from the plot of @xmath114 , eqn .  .",
    "then , with fixed @xmath83 and @xmath104 the scaled spin glass susceptibility can be plotted in the form @xmath115 against @xmath116 , eqn .  , with the correction to scaling exponent",
    "@xmath92 chosen such that the plot is a straight line over the thermodynamic limit data region .",
    "the parameters @xmath117 and @xmath102 can be read off this plot .",
    "all the parameters are adjusted until the fits to both equations and are optimised for the thermodynamic limit data .",
    "in practice the fits lead to accurately determined values for @xmath118 and the other parameters , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig:17 ] .",
    "this value is fully reliable under the unique condition that @xmath23 has been correctly determined .",
    "an accurate knowledge of @xmath23 is essential ; there is a one - to - one relationship between the estimate for the critical @xmath104 and the value of @xmath23 taken to construct the plot .",
    "it can be noted that in the thermodynamic limit regime @xmath119 there is `` self - averaging '' , or in other words all individual isg samples of a system have the same properties and in particular the same spin glass susceptibility .",
    "thus in this regime there is no real need to average over large numbers of samples to obtain accurate measurements of the mean @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , equilibration in the thermodynamic limit region is relatively rapid so measurements are very reliable and not subject to equilibration difficulties . on the contrary , in the regime near , at and beyond @xmath23 `` lack of self - averaging '' sets in ; the inter - sample variability is important .",
    "the non - self - averaging parameters are size independent @xcite at and beyond @xmath83 so however large the individual isg samples they are all different from each other ; there is a wide distribution of values of the spin glass susceptibility and other properties .",
    "the onset of a non - zero variability is a spin glass criterion for an approach to the transition temperature which obviously has no equivalent in pure systems such as simple ferromagnets . even in diluted ferromagnets",
    "the non - self - averaging is non - zero in the thermodynamic limit only at @xmath121 .",
    "for equilibration and measurements we used standard heat bath updating ( without parallel tempering ) on randomly selected sites .",
    "the samples ( usually @xmath122 ) started off at infinite temperature and was then gradually cooled before reaching their final designated temperature . for temperatures near @xmath123",
    "this means that each sample went through at least @xmath124 , sometimes @xmath125 , sweeps before any measurements took place .",
    "normally there were about 10 sweeps between measurements , depending on temperature , maintaining on average @xmath126 spin flips between each measurement . for each sample and temperature we collected between @xmath127 and @xmath124 measurements depending on lattice size .",
    "the test for equilibration was discussed above .",
    "it can be noted that a sample with @xmath128 in dimension @xmath1 corresponds to as many individual spins as a sample with @xmath129 in dimension @xmath24 .",
    "no detailed numerical simulation measurements have been reported before for isgs in dimension five . however , the analysis of a @xmath109 term high temperature series expansion ( htse ) calculation @xcite gave the estimate @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 , with a critical exponent @xmath132 , for the bimodal isg in @xmath1d .",
    "we have re - analyzed the two series in an unorthodox but transparent manner , appendix i , and obtain values for @xmath23 and @xmath0 very close to the central values in the original htse analysis but with additional information as to the strength of the correction to scaling term in the two cases .",
    "it can be seen that the correction to scaling is strong in the @xmath1d bimodal case ( and practically negligible in the @xmath1d gaussian case ) .",
    "numerical data derived from the various @xmath133 and @xmath134 distributions , all taken in the same runs on the same sets of samples for each @xmath28 , are shown in figures [ fig:1 ] to [ fig:7 ] .",
    "the error bars correspond to inter - sample variability for each particular parameter .",
    "the spin overlap @xmath11 based phenomenological couplings @xmath29 kurtosis eqn .  , @xmath73 eqn .  , and the skewness of the absolute @xmath29 distribution eqn .",
    "show very similar forms .",
    "because of the strong dispersion of individual sample parameter values , crossing points derived from the present data with a modest number of samples scatter and can not provide an accurate estimate for @xmath23 .",
    "the data are broadly compatible with the central htse estimate but on their own do not provide anything like a critical test , which for these parameters would require averaging over a much larger number of samples .    with the present sets of of samples , the most useful spin overlap parameter is the kurtosis of the absolute value distribution , @xmath52 eqn .  .",
    "it shows a strong dip for each @xmath28 in the region of the htse @xmath23 estimate .",
    "the center of the dip as a function of temperature can be estimated quite accurately for each @xmath28 .",
    "when the central dip positions are plotted against @xmath135 and extrapolated to @xmath136 , the data give an estimate @xmath137 .",
    "this is the most precise estimate obtained from the spin overlap distributions and is fully consistent with the htse central value .    the link overlap parameters @xmath85 and @xmath138 show much smaller inter - sample variability than the parameters based on spin overlap . by luck @xmath138",
    "has negligible finite size correction to scaling for the @xmath1d bimodal case ; the curves for different @xmath28 all intersect at the same @xmath139 , which coincides with the central value for @xmath23 from the htse estimate @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "this result both validates the assumption that this link overlap parameter is a _ bona fide _ phenomenological coupling , and improves the precision on the value of the critical temperature . for @xmath85",
    "there are weak finite size corrections to scaling , but the intersection points @xmath88 as functions of @xmath43 for fixed @xmath28 can be extrapolated to infinite @xmath43 to obtain an estimate @xmath140 which is again in agreement with the htse value .",
    "in addition the ( negative ) maximum in the derivative @xmath141 deepens with increasing @xmath28 and its position @xmath142 can with extrapolation also be used to estimate @xmath83 . the intersection criterion and",
    "the maximum slope criterion conveniently bracket the critical @xmath83 more and more closely as the sizes are increased . from these @xmath143 and @xmath70 numerical data alone",
    "one can thus derive a very precise estimate @xmath144 , entirely consistent with the htse central estimate .",
    "the @xmath30 kurtosis @xmath145 and @xmath30 skewness @xmath146 peak positions are subject to finite size corrections but are also consistent with this estimate for @xmath83 .",

    "<S> extensive simulations are made of link and spin overlaps in four and five dimensional ising spin glasses ( isgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> moments and moment ratios of the mean link overlap distributions ( the variance , the kurtosis and the skewness ) show clear critical behavior around the isg ordering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the link overlap measurements can be used to identify the isg transition accurately ; the link overlap is often a more efficient tool in this context than the spin overlap because the link overlap inter - sample variability is much weaker . </S>",
    "<S> once the transition temperature is accurately established , critical exponents can be readily estimated by extrapolating measurements made in the thermodynamic limit regime . </S>",
    "<S> the data show that the bimodal and gaussian spin glass susceptibility exponents @xmath0 are different from each other , both in dimension @xmath1 and in dimension @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> hence isg critical exponents are not universal in a given dimension , but depend on the form of the interaction distribution . </S>"
