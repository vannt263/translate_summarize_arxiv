    "accurate estimates of the dark matter content of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are crucial for furthering our understanding of galaxy formation and structure . calculating reliable mass estimates has historically been an awkward problem as with only line - of - sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "velocity measurements the mass profile of a spherical galaxy can only be inferred by making an assumption about the degree of velocity anisotropy i.e. the ratio of radial to tangential motion .    through comparisons to solutions of the jeans equations , it has been shown that the mass contained near the half - light radius of a dispersion - supported galaxy is approximately independent of the velocity anisotropy and the radial profile of the dark and luminous matter and is simply related to the half - light radius @xmath2 and the luminosity - averaged l.o.s .",
    "velocity dispersion @xmath3 . there exist several different forms for these formulae in the literature @xcite that may be summarised as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass contained within a sphere of radius @xmath6 and @xmath7 the familiar gravitational constant .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that for @xmath11 ( approximately the 3d spherical half - light radius for a range of observationally - motivated profiles ) that @xmath12 reproduced the results from full jeans analyses and was also shown to be mathematically true under the assumption of a near - flat velocity dispersion profile .",
    "although spherical mass estimators have proved useful for understanding dsphs , they can not give the full picture as they do not consider the fundamentally aspherical shape of these galaxies .",
    "our aim in this letter is to find mass estimators equivalent to equation   applicable to flattened systems .",
    "we begin by inspecting the validity of the spherical mass estimators and go on to investigate the applicability of the estimator when considering flattened systems in which the dark and light matter are stratified on the same self - similar ellipsoids .",
    "we give formulae similar to equation   that may be used when the 3d shape of the system is known . by marginalizing over prior assumptions on the intrinsic shape and alignment , we show how the mass can be estimated when the intrinsic shape and alignment are not known .",

    "both estimators perform well .",
    "however , again as @xmath29 is increased , @xmath22 deviates significantly and so the estimators perform poorly for @xmath35 .",
    "we now explore how the mass estimators perform as the parameters of a double power - law dark matter density profile are altered .",

    "we find that when varying the inner and outer slopes the pinch point where the mass is the same for all profiles is around @xmath42 i.e. the radius recommended by @xcite .",
    "varying @xmath29 produces a pinch point further out .",
    "this helps explain why mass estimators derived for use on realistic halos with @xmath43 can constrain the mass at larger radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we now turn to adapting the spherical mass estimators for application to flattened systems .",
