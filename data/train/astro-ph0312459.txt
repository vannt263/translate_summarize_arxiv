    "the detection and analysis of objects at very high redshift is a challenging but rapidly advancing field . in recent months increasing numbers of galaxies have been found at redshifts of @xmath13 , as a result both of narrow - band selection ( e.g. rhoads et al .  2003 , taniguchi et al .",

    "2003 , stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 hereafter sbm03 ) .",
    "however , until now , spectroscopic confirmation of very high redshift candidates has only been possible for objects at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "spectroscopic surveys for fainter objects are essential to shape our understanding of the universe at these redshifts and , with modern instrumentation and new techniques for faint - object spectroscopy , such surveys are now possible .",

    "] of three lyman-@xmath1 emitters , two of which are new , identified in the early observation data of the glare project .",

    "the goal of program gs2003b - q-7 was to obtain a total of 100 hours exposure on this udf mask .",
    "this letter concerns the first 7.5 hours of data .",
    "observations were made with the r150 grating at 9000central wavelength and a custom made 7800  longpass filter ( ` rg780 ' ) giving a spectral range from 7800  up to the ccd cutoff ( about 10,000 ) and a spectroscopic resolution of 15  ( 4 pixels fwhm at 3.5  / pix ) with 07 wide slits , a resolving power of @xmath17 . as the seeing disk ( @xmath185 fwhm ) was smaller than the slit width ( 07 ) , the true resolution is somewhat better for a source which does not fill the slit .",
    "the data was taken using the ` nod & shuffle ' ( n&s ) observing mode ( cuillandre et al .",

    "relative flux calibration was performed using observations of a standard star , the absolute flux calibration was done by normalizing the spectra of the mask alignment stars to their @xmath4-band photometric fluxes .",
    "sky lines were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "1d and 2d sky - subtracted spectra were inspected for the presence of emission lines .",
    "an advantage of the n&s data reduction technique is that lines appear in a positive - negative dipole pattern in the 2d images making them easy to distinguish from residual ccd defects and other non - astrophysical effects .",
    "spectroscopic candidates for this program were selected using the @xmath8-drop lyman break technique ( see sbm03 or dickinson et al .  2003 ) . this photometric selection method has been used by a number of authors to identify @xmath10 galaxies ( e.g. bremer et al.2004 , lehnert & bremer 2003 at @xmath19 , dickinson et al .",

    "the emission line equivalent widths can be calculated from their @xmath4 band photometry and line fluxes .",

    "charlot & fall 1993 ) , the theoretical lyman-@xmath1 equivalent width for a young region of active star formation is @xmath59 .",
    "however , observed lyman-@xmath1 emission from star - forming galaxies is generally weaker in continuum - selected samples at lower redshifts , which typically have @xmath60  ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) , or even in absorption .",
    "our @xmath61 sample has a comparable selection but the equivalent widths of # 3011 is notably larger .",
    "we note that @xmath61 narrow - band selected samples also produce higher equivalent widths with a median of 200  ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 , hu et al .",

    "careful inspection of the spectra reveal no other lines .",

    "typical line ratios from composite qso spectra are @xmath67 ( osterbrock 1989 ) . although our constraints are admittedly weak , the non - detection of n  v1240  favours the interpretation that the lyman-@xmath1 arises from the lyman continuum flux produced by ob stars , rather than the harder uv spectrum of a qso .    none of the objects in this paper correspond to x - ray sources in the chandra deep field south 1ms catalog which covers this region ( giacconi et al .",
    "this allows us to place a limit on their x - ray fluxes in the @xmath68kev ( soft ) and @xmath69kev ( hard ) bands at @xmath70 and @xmath71 ergs @xmath37 s@xmath12 respectively .",
    "the hard x - ray flux limits rule out a type ii qso like cdf - s 202 ( norman et al 2002 ) but not cxo-52 ( stern et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray limits would permit low - luminosity seyferts and qsos ( malhotra et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the line emission we see is not broad .    given that an agn interpretation for the observed emission lines is unlikely , the rest frame - uv spectra of these objects is likely to be dominated by star formation .",
    "the relation between the flux density in the rest - uv around 1500  and the star formation rate ( @xmath72 in @xmath73 ) is given by @xmath74 ( madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ) for a salpeter ( 1955 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) with @xmath75 .",

    "2003 , dickinson et al .",
    "the @xmath8-drop selection procedure used to identify candidate objects for spectroscopy is in principle sensitive to objects in the redshift range @xmath76 although the sharp fall off in transmission of the @xmath4 filter effectively restricts detection of objects to a smaller redshift range which varies with absolute magnitude ( @xmath77 for an @xmath78 lyman break galaxy , see sbm03 ) .",
    "the line centers of three of the four lyman-@xmath1 emitters detected in the goods - s field are separated by 2000kms@xmath12 ( only @xmath79% of the survey redshift range ) .",
    "the maximum angular separation of the the three objects ( glare#1042 , # 3001 , sbm03#3 ) is less than 11.5arcmin , corresponding to a projected separation of only @xmath80mpc .",
    "this suggests the interesting possibility of an overdensity of lyman-@xmath1 emitters at @xmath11 in this field , perhaps similar to that observed at @xmath81 in ssa22 by steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    to quantify the statistical likelihood of this",
    "happening by chance we undertook a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "a population uniformly distributed in redshift between @xmath76 was considered and the effects of gmos throughput ( including the rg780 filter ) and increased noise due to skylines on spectroscopic detection , and igm absorption leading to incomplete @xmath4 filter coverage on lyman break photometric selection , were modelled .",
    "the effects of an apparent magnitude limit on the photometric selection were also calculated , using the measured luminosity function for lyman break galaxies at @xmath82 ( steidel et al.1999 ) as an approximation for the currently unknown @xmath83 luminosity function .",
    "although each of these effects bias detection probability towards the lower end of the accessible redshift range , the probability of selecting 3 or more out of 4 galaxies within @xmath402000 km s@xmath12 of @xmath84 was still small ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this suggests that we have statistical evidence for a redshift spike at @xmath11 in this field , which augurs well for the future udf observations .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of the three galaxies presented in this work are similar to those of other confirmed high redshift lyman break galaxies .",
    "lehnert & bremer ( 2003 ) report ly-@xmath1 luminosities of @xmath86 ergs s@xmath12 for 6 @xmath87 line emitters in a sample of 12 lyman break candidates .",
    "the fluxes for our @xmath83 ly-@xmath1 emitters fall comfortably into this range of luminosities and probe to a comparable depth .",

    "in this paper we have presented photometry and spectra for three objects with extreme @xmath9 colors and line emission which may be lyman-@xmath1 at @xmath91 , observed as part of the glare project .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the glare project has detected three very high redshift objects ( @xmath92 ) in the first 7.5 hours of integration time on gemini / gmos - s . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the two new lyman-@xmath1 emitters are fainter in @xmath4 than any previous lyman break selected objects with a spectroscopic redshift .",
