    "we also calculated the reaction @xmath2ca(n,@xmath3ca , which may be of importance in connection with an interpretation of the @xmath2ti overabundance observed in fun inclusions of the allende meteorite ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the cn mechanism",
    "the projectile merges with the target nucleus and excites many degrees of freedom of the cn .",
    "the excitation proceeds via a multistep process and has a reaction time typically of the order @xmath6s to @xmath7s . after this time the cn decays into various exit channels . in the di process",
    "the projectile excites only a few degrees of freedom ( e.g. single  particle or collective ) .",
    "the excitation proceeds in one single step and has a characteristic time scale of @xmath8s to @xmath9s .",
    "this corresponds to the time it takes the projectile to pass through the target nucleus ; this time is much shorter than the reaction time of the cn processes .    for thermonuclear ( in the kev region ) and thermal ( in the mev region ) projectile energies the competition between the different reaction mechanisms is quite complicated .",
    "normally the cn formation prevails below projectile energies of approximately 10 to 20mev .",
    "however , for light nuclei and magic nuclei the cn formation is often suppressed because there are no cn levels that can be populated . in this case",
    "the di reaction mechanism can dominate the nuclear reaction .",

    "@xcite by dobado and poves @xcite ( complete sd  fp shell model ) , as well as own qrpa shell  model calculations ( gamow  teller strength ) , using the code of mller and randrup @xcite agree quite well with the experimental observations .",
    "the most remarkable result is the absence of @xmath19 states ( s  wave resonances ) up to at least @xmath20kev , which can be understood in terms of the specific quasiparticle structure of @xmath10ca .",
    "the second observation is that the d  wave strength is considerably larger than the p  wave strength .",
    "this is due to the existence of a d  wave giant resonance for @xmath21 . finally , no strong neutron ",

    "the two very small resonances at 20kev and 107kev only found in neutron capture @xcite , but not in @xmath16delayed neutron decay @xcite and not in the ( d , p)reaction @xcite , are probably also d  wave resonances with @xmath22 .    with this nuclear  structure information on @xmath10ca average continuum ( hf ) and resonance ( breit  wigner , bw ) neutron  capture rates were derived using the code smoker @xcite . when comparing these values with the measured 30kev mawellian ",
    "averaged capture cross section of @xmath0ca ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , one can draw the following conclusions : the statistical  model ( hf ) prediction agrees with the measured cross section at 30 kev of about 1 mb ; this result must , however , be regarded as completely fortuitous .",
    "the contribution of the resonances , i.e. the bw cross section , is only about 5% of the total neutron ",
    "capture rate .",
    "hence , in the case of the doubly  magic nucleus @xmath0ca , 95% must be due to direct reaction processes .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0ca(n,@xmath23 ) , the nuclear structure information on the radioactive target @xmath2ca and the compound nucleus @xmath24ca are scarce .",

    "similar to the compound nucleus @xmath10ca , the most remarkable result is the absence of @xmath19 states up to 0.85mev beyond the neutron separation energy ( @xmath26mev @xcite ) .",
    "this results in a resonance capture cross section of @xmath27 mb when using the bw  formalism of the smoker code @xcite .",
    "if this were the total capture rate for @xmath2ca , in any astrophysical s and n@xmath16type neutron  capture process @xcite the build  up of @xmath28 ca isotopes would be strongly hindered by successful competition of @xmath16decay . with this , a strong overabundance of @xmath2ti  as observed in certain meteoritic inclusions ( for discussion see refs .",
    "@xcite )  would result .",
    "however , also in the case of @xmath2ca neutron capture , it is not unlikely that @xmath29 represents only a small fraction of the total cross section which may be dominated by the di reaction rate .",
    "shell  model considerations ( using the qrpa code of mller et al .",

    ", we will present our direct neutron  capture calculations using as input parameters the experimental and theoretical information given above .",
    "potential models have often been used to describe direct reactions at thermonuclear and thermal projectile energies ( ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they are based on the description of the dynamics of the reaction by a schrdinger equation with optical potentials in the entrance and exit channel .",
    "such models are the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) for transfer reactions or the direct capture model ( dc ) for radiative capture .",
    "the dc cross section ist given by @xcite @xmath38 the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are the spins ( magnetic quantum numbers ) of the target nucleus @xmath43 , residual nucleus @xmath44 and projectile @xmath45 , respectively .",

    "this parameter can be adjusted to elastic scattering data and/or bound and resonant state energies of nuclear cluster states and at the same time ensures the correct behaviour of the wave functions in the nuclear exterior .    for the calculation of the di capture cross section ( eqs .",
    "( [ a][ad ] ) ) we used the code tedca @xcite .",
    "the folding potentials ( eq .  ( [ ad ] ) ) were determined with the help of the code vold @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath0ca(n,@xmath1ca was calculated for projectile energies below 250kev .",

    "the strength of the potential @xmath87 in the entrance channel was determined using neutron scattering data obtained from @xcite .",
    "the data was fitted to pure s - wave scattering with @xmath88b resulting in a @xmath87 of 0.93357 and giving a volume integral of 436.9mev@xmath89 .",
    "+ for the optical potential in the entrance channel we neglected the imaginary part potential because the flux into the other channels is very small .",
    "one may wonder , if the capture process would not itself produce a large damping , because at low energies the capture cross section is larger than the elastic cross section . for instance , at thermal energies the neutron  capture cross section of @xmath0ca is about 1b , whereas the elastic neutron cross section is about 0.02b .",
    "however , this can be explained by the different phase ",
    "space factors for the capture and elastic cross sections . for the capture cross section near threshold one can write @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the logarithmic derivative at a radial distance @xmath92 .",
    "the elastic cross section is about constant for projectiles near threshold , whereas the capture cross section has the well known 1/@xmath93behaviour . from the thermal value of the capture cross section , using @xmath94fm , @xmath95 is obtained .",
    "since this expression can be regarded as a measure of damping in the entrance channel , we see that the damping effects are rather small .",
    "therefore , at low energies the large value of the capture cross section ( 1/@xmath93behaviour ) compared to the elastic cross section ( only weakly energy  dependent ) is due to the phase ",

    "the cross section for the transitions to the other high  spin states in the final nucleus can be neglected ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "<S> in neutron capture for magic  shell nuclei the direct reaction mechanism can be important and may even dominate . as an example we investigated the reaction @xmath0ca(n,@xmath1ca for projectile energies below 250kev in a direct capture model using the folding procedure for optical and bound state potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained theoretical cross sections are in agreement with the experimental data showing the dominance of the direct reaction mechanism in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the above method was also used to calculate the cross section for @xmath2ca(n,@xmath3ca . </S>"
