    "the densest organization of small discs on an infinite plane is obtained when their centres are at the nodes of the triangular tiling of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "all these discs occupy the same area on the plane and have the same local environment of six equally - spaced first neighbours which is reproduced all over the plane according to the laws of classical crystallography .",
    "this crystalline solution remains valid for a limited assembly of small discs within a finite compact domain of the plane under the condition that the borders of the domain be aligned along reticular directions of the lattice . if not , as for a circular domain , this solution is no longer valid , the circular symmetry of the domain being not accounted for by the finite number of rotational symmetries of a crystal .",
    "it has been shown that the best packing efficiency found in the case of circular symmetry is that obtained when the centres of the discs are regularly placed on the spiral drawn by the algorithm of phyllotaxis  @xcite .",
    "this solution approaches circular symmetry , but the area per disc , the number of first neighbours and their distances are no longer constant as they are in the case with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "those differences between crystalline and phyllotactic organizations were recently analyzed considering not only the positions of the centres of the discs but also the polygonal nature of their voronoi cells  @xcite .",
    "such an analysis shows that the phyllotactic best packing efficiency results from an interplay between metric and topological distortions leading to a structure with an inflation - deflation symmetry .",
    "we study here the distributions of points with their voronoi cells drawn by the algorithm of phyllotaxis onto surfaces of constant gaussian curvatures , positive for the sphere or negative for the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we examine how the best packing efficiency typical of the distribution on the plane evolves with the curvature of the underlying surface , considering both short - range ( the shape of a cell , its area and the distances from its centre to the first neighbour points ) and long - range characteristics ( the repetition law governing the organization of the cells ) .",
    "the part of this work concerning plane and spherical phyllotaxis was motivated by our interest for the lateral organizations of long biological molecules in dense fibres with a circular section imposed by their surface tension @xcite .",
    "these organizations can indeed be represented by distributions of points on planar or spherical bases according to the fact that the molecules can be parallel or twisted within the fibres .",
    "spherical phyllotaxis was also used earlier as a simple ideal approached by vegetal forms  @xcite , in order to obtain the most homogeneous sampling of points on a sphere in numerical integration  @xcite , to develop climate models of the earth  @xcite or to estimate the earth coverage of satellite constellations  @xcite .",
    "we do not know of any application concerning phyllotaxis on surfaces with negative gaussian curvature up to now .    since the distributions on the sphere and the hyperbolic plane will be compared to",
    "that observed on the plane , we recall first the main features of the latter , limiting ourselves to what is needed for this comparison , with demonstrations and more details given in  @xcite .",
    "the voronoi cells , used in  @xcite to describe phyllotaxis on the plane are an efficient tool to analyze the geometry and the topology of the structure .",
    "a phyllotactic distribution of points indexed by @xmath0 is described by an algorithm such that the position of point @xmath0 is given by its polar coordinates : @xmath1 which is the equation of a fermat spiral called generative spiral hereafter .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 defines the metric scale .",
    "sites , indexed by positive integers @xmath0 , are placed on this spiral and the next , to successive integers .",
    "taking @xmath3 leads to a more regular structure in the core of the phyllotaxis and it appears as a @xmath4 rotation for large @xmath0 . ] , so that the azimuth between two successive points varies by @xmath5 .",
    "the best packing efficiency is obtained for @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the golden ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the voronoi cell of point @xmath0 is defined as the region of space nearer to it than to any other point of the pattern .",
    "the phyllotactic pattern of a set of 3000 points with their voronoi cells is shown in figure  [ f1 ] .    in such a pattern , pentagons and heptagons are topological defects distributed among hexagons .",
    "these defects appear concentrated in narrow circular rings with constant width , separating large annuli of hexagons whose width increases from the core towards the periphery . in the narrow rings , pentagons and heptagons are paired as dipoles separated by hexagons whose shape is that of a square with two adjacent corners cut off .",
    "the defect rings are indeed grain boundaries separating grains of hexagonal cells , each dipole acting as a dislocation that introduces a new parastichy ( the lines joining first neighbours ) to maintain the density as constant as possible .",
    "the underlying arithmetic of this organization is that of the fibonacci sequence , @xmath9 from @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "so cells are organized in concentric blocks , grains separated by grain boundaries , surrounding a central core containing about ten points and showing an apparent disorder recalling the structure of confined two - dimensions foams . in this paper",
    "we are interested in large structures , so that we shall consider what happens outside the core : a succession of large grains of hexagonal cells that are concentric circular annuli , bounded and separated by circular grain boundaries @xmath12 made of @xmath13 heptagonal cells , @xmath14 hexagonal cells and @xmath13 pentagonal cells .",
    "points organized on the plane according to the algorithm of phyllotaxis with the golden ratio .",
    "each point is surrounded by its polygonal voronoi cell whose number of sides corresponds to the number of first neighbours around the point .",
    "blue , red and green cells are respectively pentagons , hexagons and heptagons .",
    "the three spirals joining the first neighbours of the points are called parastichies .",
    "the white dot marks the origin point @xmath15 . ]",
    "these grain boundaries serve as natural boundaries for our optimal packing problem .",
    "outwards packing begins with the first complete grain boundary @xmath16 with 13 heptagons , 8 hexagons and 13 pentagons .",
    "the core is bounded by the 8 pentagons of the ( first ) incomplete grain boundary @xmath17 .",
    "it has 3 heptagons instead of the full 8 .",
    "the additional pentagons ( nearly ) fulfil the topological requirement that a tiled circular domain should have a topological charge of 6 ( i.e. 6 additional pentagons , a sphere having a topological charge 12 )  @xcite .",

    "on this plane representation of a spherical phyllotaxis the distance separating two close points whose indices are @xmath0 and @xmath44 with @xmath150 is always given by the equation  [ equa5 ] , but where @xmath89 is given by the equation  [ equac1 ] .",
    "with equation  [ equa5 ] this distance is evaluated with the plane metric , so to have the true distances on the sphere needs to take account of a correcting factor to the metric which is @xmath151 as given in appendix  c by equation  [ equac2 ] .",
    "then the distances are given by : @xmath152 this analytical distances fit the distances presented on the figure  [ f8 ] obtained from coordinates of the spherical phyllotaxis taking account of a scaling factor @xmath92 in order to have mean area of cells equal @xmath43 .",
    "the important conclusion is that these distances are again confined in the same domain found for the plane phyllotaxis . like in the case of the plane ,",
    "the maximum for distance is still @xmath99 corresponding , to cells close to squares with a distance corresponding to the diagonal .",
    "it can be checked that minimal values of @xmath100 ( equation  [ equa9 ] ) are @xmath101 very close to and converging toward @xmath58 like for the plane phyllotaxis . as in the plane and hyperbolic cases ,",
    "it is this confinement of distances which is the signature of the best uniformity in all orientations .    .",
    "two examples are given with @xmath153 and @xmath154 points on the sphere .",
    "( right ) for the same spheres , distance between points @xmath0 and its first neighbours @xmath44 with positive @xmath19 in the north hemisphere and negative @xmath19 in the south .",
    "green , blue and red correspond to distance along these three visible parastichies .",
    "distances are in the limits @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "curves for the two examples @xmath153 and @xmath155 look very similar , mainly for distances : this is because the @xmath42 values are chosen to have grain boundaries at the same angular positions as given on figure  [ f7 ] . ]    [ f8 ]",
    "the spiral organization generated by the algorithm of phyllotaxis with the golden ratio ensures the best packing efficiency of points on a plane in a situation of circular symmetry @xcite .",
    "we examined here how this simple schema could be affected when the bearing surface presents a positive or negative gaussian curvature , limiting ourselves to curvature radii much larger than the mean distance between points .",
    "drawings of figures  [ f1 ] ,  [ f3 ] and  [ f5 ] show that the phyllotactic patterns always present the same appearance .",
    "they are all made of a core , without any obvious discernable order , surrounded by an ordered series of alternate concentric rings .",
    "the cores are the same , they occupy a limited region around the centres of the patterns where the curved surfaces can be assimilated to their tangent plane .",
    "the alternate concentric rings are respectively large rings , or grains , containing points with six first neighbors and narrow rings , or grain boundaries , containing also points with five and seven first neighbors associated in dipoles , or dislocations .",
    "those topological defects are needed to maintain the density as constant as possible in this situation of circular symmetry .",
    "a detailed analysis of grain boundaries makes apparent the fact that they can be found identical to themselves on the three kinds of surfaces .",
    "the number , distribution and orientation of dipoles on each of them , as well as their evolution from one to the next , do not depend on the curvature of the surface , their perimeters just follow the fibonacci series as shown in table i. this directly proceeds from the mathematical structure of the algorithm of phyllotaxis with the golden ratio as developed in appendix a. figure  [ fa1 ] shows indeed that the dipoles are organized along a grain boundary according to a quasicrystalline sequence whose evolution from one grain boundary to the next is driven by a well defined inflation / deflation rule .",
    "the distributions of the whole set of points on surfaces of different curvatures must respect this most remarkable structural invariance of the grain boundaries as developed in the following paragraphs .    as the perimeters of the grain boundaries are constrained to follow the fibonacci series , the distance between them on the surfaces , or the widths of the grains they enclose , vary differently according to the sign of the curvature .",
    "if we call @xmath156 the perimeter and @xmath114 the radius of curvature , the radii of the grain boundaries indeed varies as @xmath157 on the plane , @xmath158 on the sphere and @xmath159 on the hyperbolic plane and the width of a given grain decreases as the curvature goes from a positive to a negative value .",
    "this results in the more or less rapid dampening of the area per cell around @xmath43 visible on figures  [ f8 ] ,  [ f2 ] and  [ f4 ] .",
    "as the dipoles on the grain boundaries have well - defined alternate orientations relative to the radius vector with an angle close to @xmath160 , the anchoring conditions of the parastichies at the two limits of any grain are the same whatever the curvature of the surface and the width of the grain .",
    "this constraint manifests itself by the fact that the distances between first neighbors oscillate , along more or less extended horizontal scales , between the same limits and cross each other at the same level on the whole plane and hyperbolic plane as shown by figures  [ f2 ] and  [ f4 ] .",
    "however , on the sphere , such an oscillating behaviour is observed on a limited polar cap only and not around the equator , as shown on figure  [ f8 ] .",
    "this holds to the fact that , when two new grain boundaries merge along the equator , their dipoles are parallel and stay parallel as they move towards their pole as the sphere grows .",
    "the anchoring conditions of the parastichies in the grain surrounding the equator do not alternate as they do in other grains and the shape of its voronoi cells evolves differently than in normal grains .",
    "figures  [ f5 ] and  [ f6 ] show that cells in the equatorial belt may keep a shape close to that of a square rather than becoming hexagonal as in normal grains .    finally , owing to the inflation / deflation rule determining the quasi crystalline sequences of the grain boundaries they form by themselves a self similar set which is scale invariant as the characteristic distance is changed by a factor which is an approximant of @xmath161 .",
    "when on the plane , this self similarity is transferred onto the pattern as , assimilating grain boundaries with ideal circles , their perimeter vary as successive approximants of @xmath7 and the area of the grains vary as @xmath162 .",
    "this is however not valid on the sphere or the hyperbolic plane where the area of the grains do not follow a variation in @xmath162 .",
    "points . color of the points correspond to the type of their voronoi cells : hexagon ( red ) , heptagon ( green ) and pentagon ( blue ) .",
    "the first point in green is down , then points are numbered , increasing by @xmath163 going up or decreasing by @xmath164 going right .",
    "this strip can be divided into three strips of heptagons , hexagons and pentagons . ]    [ fa1 ]    the way dislocation dipoles are organized along circles is strongly related to 1d quasicrystals @xcite . a fibonacci 1d quasicrystal can be obtained using an inflation - deflation rule iteratively applied to a sequence of long and short segments .",
    "this inflation - deflation rule is @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "starting simply from a short segment this specific rule gives a quasicrystal after an infinite number of iterations , or with a given number of iterations , a finite structure with a number of short and long segments given by two successive fibonacci numbers .",
    "consider now dipoles formed by an heptagon and a pentagon in contact along grain boundaries .",
    "there are isolated dipoles , singletons and pair of close dipoles .",
    "the application of the rule changes a singleton into a pair of dipoles and changes pair of dipoles into a pair and a singleton , and transforms one ring of dipoles into the next one .",
    "so there is an inflation - deflation symmetry associated with radial change relating defects in this structure .",
    "this can be checked counting the number of pair of dipoles or of isolated dipoles which are successive fibonacci numbers , on circles of defects .",
    "one dimension quasicrystals can be obtained by the cut and projection method , selecting the points of a square lattice falling inside a strip defined by translation of a cell of the lattice along a straight line of slope @xmath7 .",
    "approximants are obtained when the slope is a convergent of @xmath7 given by the ratio of two successive fibonacci numbers .",
    "the figure [ fa1 ] which describes how a grain boundary can be derived from a selection of points in a square lattices is similar to the cut and projection method applied to approximants .",
    "the description of grain boundaries as a strip of squares , allows to estimate their lengths .",
    "we suppose , as it is done in the text , a square edge length @xmath167 for square of @xmath43 area .",
    "the length of the grain with @xmath168 dipoles is the module of the vector @xmath169 which is @xmath170 or simply @xmath171 . folding the strip into a ring , this length is the perimeter of a circle , then it is possible to estimate the number of points of the phyllotactic pattern in the domain enclosed by this circle .",
    "dipoles which are oriented along parastichies ( refereed by @xmath18 in table  [ tab1 ] ) are close to make the same angle with the radial direction ( in absolute value as their orientations alternate ) . considering the description of grain boundaries by a strip in a square lattice ( figure [ fa1 ] )",
    ", dipoles are represented along square edges and make a constant angle with the large strip side related to the slope of the strip @xmath172 .",
    "the angle with the normal to the strip is @xmath173 .",
    "this is also the angle of a dipole with the radial direction for a strip refolded into the ring of a grain boundary if we consider that resulting distortions are small .",
    "in fact this is exactly the angle with the radial direction done by the parastichies @xmath18 through the medium point of the grain boundary , whatever is the curvature .",
    "there are two correlated properties of inflation - deflation symmetry related to grain boundaries .",
    "the first one is the organization of dipole on a grain boundary which is like an approximant .",
    "the other aspect , developed in @xcite relates a grain boundary to the next one .",
    "there is a symmetry mixing spiral symmetry and inflation - deflation symmetry associating the two grain .",
    "nevertheless such symmetry needs the scale invariance of the plane and can not be considered in curved geometries . in plane geometry the ratio of the radius of two successive grain boundaries is @xmath31 converging toward @xmath7 for large fibonacci numbers .",
    "this is a consequence of the inflation - deflation symmetry in plane geometry .",
    "the structure of a grain boundary is only related to its rank @xmath18 through fibonacci number @xmath29 and does not depend on the space curvature .",
    "it is the same for spherical , plane and hyperbolic phyllotaxis .",
    "the poincar disc model , also known as the conformal disc model is a simple way to represent the hyperbolic plane .",
    "it is a mapping of the whole hyperbolic plane on the interior of a circle , so this limit circle represent infinity .",
    "it is a conformal mapping respecting angles between geodesic lines which are represented by arcs of circles that are orthogonal to the limit circle  @xcite .",
    "a method to introduce the hyperbolic plane and its representation , is to refer to spherical geometry changing the gaussian curvature @xmath174 into @xmath175 , where @xmath114 is the radius of curvature of the surface . by analogy with the equation of a sphere embedded in the euclidean 3d space",
    ", it would be tempting to write @xmath176 with an imaginary radius , but the hyperbolic plane can not be entirely embedded in @xmath177 .",
    "so we need a representation of the hyperbolic plane by a surface with a given metric . a good example is given by the minkowski plane .",
    "consider a 3d vector @xmath178 in a 3d space with a metric such that the squared modulus of the vector is @xmath179 .",
    "the equation @xmath180 defines a two sheets hyperboloid surface .",
    "a single sheet , with the appropriate metric , is a model of a surface , with minkowski metric , whose gaussian curvature is @xmath175 .",
    "geodesics of this surface are intersection lines between the hyperboloid and planes through the origin .    using polar coordinates to describe the @xmath181 vector we have @xmath182 for points on a sheet .",
    "the minkowski metric @xmath183 is with polar coordinates @xmath184 . by comparison with",
    "spherical geometry it is interesting to note that if we change variables into complex variables @xmath185 and @xmath186 the metric look like the usual metric of a sphere @xmath187 . in spherical geometry , the parameter @xmath114 is the radius of the sphere . in hyperbolic geometry",
    "@xmath114 can not be consider as a radius of curvature , it is only the gaussian curvature @xmath80 which is an intrinsical property of the surface .",
    "the poincar disc representation is obtained by stereographic projection of one hyperboloid sheet unto the plane @xmath188 with a projection pole @xmath189 .",
    "we consider polar coordinates @xmath62 in the plane @xmath188 ( that is in the poincar disc ) .",
    "the stereographic projection give @xmath190 or @xmath191 .",
    "using hyperbolic trigonometric identities the metric is @xmath192 .",
    "this metric has the form of an euclidean metric in polar coordinates divide by a function of @xmath65 only : it is locally an euclidean metric , a proof that the representation is conform .    to obtain the equation of the spiral allowing to build a phyllotaxis on the hyperbolic plane",
    ", the calculation of the area enclosed in a circle of a given radius @xmath193 is needed .",
    "this area is obtained using this metric .",
    "the perimeter of the circle centered at the origin is @xmath194 and so the area enclosed by this circle is @xmath195 which is : @xmath196",
    "so the total number of points on the sphere is @xmath197 . by effect of the projection size of cells",
    "seem to increase going outward , diverging for @xmath198 . ]",
    "[ fc ]    there is an other way to describe the spherical phyllotaxis by analogy to the hyperbolic one , simply changing hyperbolic trigonometry into spherical trigonometry .",
    "this give a representation on the plane of a spherical phyllotaxis , with an adjusted metric as shown in figure  [ fc ] .",
    "in fact it is a stereographic projection of the tiled sphere onto a tangent plane through north pole from a projection point on the south pole .",
    "the radial position for a point is given on the plane by @xmath199 this radial value is the radial coordinate on the plane and the true spherical distance from the origin to the point depends on the spherical metric : @xmath200 this is a metric which has the form of an euclidean metric in polar coordinates divided by a function of @xmath65 only .",
    "this is practically useful to calculate distances : they are calculated as euclidean distances on the representation , then corrected using the @xmath65 function .",
    "this is a good approximation if distances remain small compare to the radius of curvature .",
    "this locally euclidean metric is related to the fact that the stereographic projection on the plane of the spherical tiling is conform .",
    "the azimuthal position is the same as in the plane case : @xmath201 with @xmath6 .    comparing the euclidean plane case to the plane representation of curved spaces like the poincar disc in the hyperbolic case or the stereographic map of the sphere ,",
    "the main difference is the behaviour of the radial part @xmath89 of the spiral equation .",
    "evidentally if we consider the usual metric of the plane , and not the given metric of representations , the size of cells increases in the stereographic map and decreases on the poincar disc .",
    "it seems possible to generalize this observation to phyllotaxis where the size of cells is not constant .",
    "any plane phyllotaxis build using a spiral equation in polar coordinates @xmath202 with @xmath203 would have always the same grain boundaries .",
    "for instance this apply to composed flowers like sunflower where the size of florets increase from the core to the periphery due to growing , very similar to the plane representation of the spherical phyllotaxis but with the plane metric ."
