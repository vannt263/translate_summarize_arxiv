    "more than 200 years gone since people observed water electrolysis for the first time ( see @xcite and references therein ) . since then the process is widely used in different applications including hydrogen production @xcite . nowadays",
    "electrolysis of water find also applications in different kind of microdevices such as actuators @xcite , pumps @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "fast performance of microsystems requires processing on a short - time scale .",
    "surprisingly enough , most of the researches on water electrolysis dealt with macro or microscopic systems on a time scale longer than milliseconds @xcite . a few papers , where shorter ( microseconds ) voltage pulses were considered , discussed increase of the overall efficiency @xcite or optimization of the performance of electrolysis @xcite , but",
    "did not observe the process on the microsecond time scale .    in normal long - time electrolysis ( long - time means here the time scale @xmath3 ms ) gas bubbles with the diameters in the range @xmath4 m",
    "are observed @xcite .",
    "the maximal current density that can be reached in this case is around 1 a@xmath5@xmath6 @xcite and the maximal relative supersaturation @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these values can not be increased further because bubbles cover all the surface of the electrode making it inactive @xcite .    in the short - time electrolysis ,",
    "say @xmath8s , one could expect unusual properties of the process .",
    "it becomes obvious if we consider gas diffusion into the liquid above the electrode . for the time @xmath9 a significant supersaturation is possible at the distance from the electrode @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the diffusion coefficient of the formed gas in the surrounding liquid .",
    "taking as typical values @xmath12m@xmath13/s and @xmath14s one finds @xmath15 nm .",
    "it means that on this timescale only nanobubbles can be formed.this is indeed the case as we demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "nanobubbles of @xmath16 nm in diameter were observed stroboscopically above microelectrodes .",
    "these nanobubbles were formed for the first @xmath17s then aggregated to microbubbles after @xmath18s , but the following dynamics was very slow .",
    "a number of observations indicate that smaller nanobubbles can exist at shorter times @xmath19s .",
    "for example , it was demonstrated that the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen can be ignited spontaneously in nanobubbles with the size smaller than @xmath2 nm @xcite .",
    "different manifestations of this reaction show that the reaction persists for nanobubbles as small as @xmath20 nm or even smaller .    in this paper",
    "we describe formation of nanobubble on the short - time scale @xmath8s .",
    "it is demonstrated that very high current densities and supersaturations can exist accompanied by the homogeneous nucleation of nanobubbles .",
    "the bubbles containing hydrogen or oxygen grow and aggregate forming micro - sized bubbles on the timescale @xmath21s .",
    "the nanobubbles containing mixture of the gases disappear as the result of the reaction between gases .",
    "these are transient nanobubbles , which exist only a short time and difficult for direct observation .",
    "in contrast with the first report @xcite we provide here detailed description of the transient nanobubbles and pay less attention to the chemical reaction inside of these bubbles .",
    "the nanobubbles discussed in this paper differ from the surface nanobubble , which attracted recently a considerable attention .",
    "the long - lived surface nanobubbles were observed with different methods @xcite .",
    "observation with atomic force microscopes ( afm ) became especially popular ( see @xcite and references therein ) due to its simple realization .",
    "these nanobubbles are widely discussed in the literature because of their mysterious stability .",
    "high laplace pressure drives diffusion of gas out of the bubble resulting in a dissolution time of @xmath0s but not days as observed ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "precise reason for this stability is not clear yet but in a promising model @xcite of `` dynamical equilibrium '' the gas flux going out of the bubble through the spherical cap is balanced with a gaseous influx at the contact line .    a number of methods to generate the surface nanobubbles are in use including solvent exchange , temperature change for liquid or substrate , and liquid pressurizing @xcite .",
    "the electrochemical formation of the surface nanobubbles were observed in water electrolysis for hydrogen @xcite and for both hydrogen and oxygen @xcite on highly orientated pyrolytic graphite .",
    "the electrochemical process is considered as a flexible way to control the bubble production ( density and size ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the electrochemical process considered in this paper the electrochemical production of the surface nanobubbles had much smaller current density ( @xmath22a/@xmath23 ) and much longer time scale ( @xmath24s ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ system ] we describe the system for observation of the short - time electrolysis , application of the voltage pulses , and the current response . in sec .",
    "[ strob ] the main results obtained with the stroboscopic observations are described .",
    "electrolysis with alternating sign pulses is described in sec . [ alternating ] where we present the results obtained with a stroboscop and vibrometer .",
    "we explain also modification of the electrode surface due to the process . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] the evolution of the transient nanobubbles is summarized and we discuss their possible applications .",
    "our conclusions are collected in the last section .",
    "to analyze electrolysis on a short - time scale in a microscopic system special microchips were prepared .",
    "one of the chips is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for fabrication we used wafers made of borofloat glass bf-33 .",
    "first , ti sublayer was deposited on glass ( @xmath25 nm ) for better adhesion , then the 100 nm thick metallic layer was sputtered .",
    "we used the wafers with different metals on top such as pt , pd , au , or w. the metals were patterned and covered lithographically with the insulating resist su8 where it was necessary .",
    "different thicknesses of su8 layer of 3 and @xmath26 m were in use .",
    "the fabricated wafers were diced on separate chips of size @xmath27mm@xmath13 .",
    "each chip contained 16 pairs of the microelectrodes of different shapes and sizes and the contact pads to address a specific pair electrically .",
    "the patterned su8 layer formed walls of open channels for a liquid . a chip filled in with the electrolyte",
    "was covered by a thing ( @xmath28 m ) glass plate for observation of the electrolysis .        as the solution for electrolysis we used @xmath29 g of na@xmath30so@xmath31 dissolved in @xmath32ml of deionized water .",
    "also we have used the solutions of nacl and ki in water in similar concentrations .",
    "the process was observed with a homemade stroboscopic system @xcite . in this system",
    "the light source and the electrical pulses applied to the electrodes were controlled with the time resolution @xmath33s .",
    "as a light source two powerful green leds luxeon@xmath34 iii were used . with this system we have been able to observe the electrodes in an optical microscope with the illumination time longer than @xmath35s .      for a chosen pair of the electrodes",
    "one was always grounded and the other one ( working electrode ) could be at a negative or positive potential .",
    "hydrogen or oxygen bubbles were produced above the working electrode .",
    "we could apply voltage as a pulse of a given length from 1 to @xmath36s",
    ". the pulse could be repeated with a frequency @xmath37 . at a prescribed moment of time",
    "a short flash of light @xmath38s was on and an optical microscope image of the electrodes was made during the flash .",
    "the applied voltage and the resulting current through the electrodes were recorded . alternatively keeping one electrode grounded we applied voltage pulses of alternating polarity to the working electrode repeated with some frequency . in",
    "this case bubbles containing both gases h@xmath30 and o@xmath30 could be formed @xcite .",
    "the voltage needed to start the electrolysis was always larger than that for macrosystems , @xmath39v .",
    "the high threshold voltage was already observed in microsystems @xcite , but the reason was not explained .",
    "it has to be stressed that in the microsystems a planar geometry is used when both electrodes are in the same plane . in this case",
    "the ohmic losses ( resistance between the electrodes ) are considerable even for well conducting electrolytes .",
    "this is in contrast with the macrosystems , where these losses are usually negligible . for one pair of electrodes we measured the resistance to be @xmath40k@xmath41 but",
    "it varies to some degree from pair to pair due to different geometry .",
    "the working current in our system @xmath42ma was quite large .",
    "then the ohmic polarization is estimated as a few volts ( @xmath43v ) .",
    "conventionally we defined the threshold for the electrolysis applying different voltages for @xmath44ms and observing the gas formation . at @xmath45",
    "the first gas was visible in the system .",
    "for example , for the same pair of electrodes , for which the resistance was measured , we found @xmath46v . in some cases @xmath47 was as large as @xmath48v or so , but we have found out that this was due to the potential drop on the electrode surface .",
    "treatment of such chips in o@xmath30-plasma significantly reduced @xmath47 .",
    "probably a film ( hydrocarbons ) was formed on top of the electrodes during the fabrication process .",
    "it should be stressed that the absolute values of the potential has to be taken with care because we deal with the two - electrode system and there is uncertainty in the potential of the working electrode in contrast with the three - electrode system .      the current response to square voltage pulses applied to the working electrode",
    "is shown fig .",
    "the response is in accordance with the expectations .",
    "one can separate two components in the current .",
    "the first one is the faradaic current @xmath49 that does not depend on time @xmath50 for square voltage pulses .",
    "the second component is responsible for the charging - discharging of the double layer on the electrode surface and is not related to the electrochemical reaction .",
    "it behaves as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a constant and @xmath53 is the relaxation time related to the capacitance of the double layer . as the result",
    "we fit the current response on the square voltage pulse by a function of three parameters : @xmath54 it has to be stressed that typically in macro and microsystems considered on the long - time scale the faradaic current @xmath49 depends on the time because it is diffusion limited . for parallel electrodes",
    "the current is proportional to @xmath55 in accordance with the cottrell equation @xcite , where @xmath56 is the diffusion time for the electroactive species in the solution . in our case the diffusion time is too long to play any role .",
    "roughly it can be estimated as @xmath57ms , where @xmath58 m is a typical size of our electrodes and @xmath59m@xmath13/s is a typical diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species in water .",
    "v and frequency @xmath60khz .",
    "( bottom ) response to the voltage pulses of alternating polarity @xmath61v , @xmath60khz .",
    "the insets show the currents from the main graph for half of one period and the fits of the currents with eq .",
    "[ i_fit ] .",
    ", width=302 ]    we used eq .",
    "( [ i_fit ] ) to fit the current response as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the quality of the fit can be seen in the insets .",
    "the faradaic current can be well approximated by a constant in the investigated time domain @xmath62s . for alternating pulses the positive @xmath63 and negative @xmath64 halves of the pulse",
    "are symmetric as shown in the bottom inset . for single polarity pulses the relaxation time @xmath53 is larger for the negative half of the pulse ( 4.9 against @xmath65s ) reflecting dependence of the double layer capacitance on the potential @xcite . for alternating polarity pulses in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have found from the fit @xmath66s . with the frequency increase the relaxation time decreases slowly indicating that not all adsorption states can be filled for a short time .",
    "it has to be noted that the faraday component of the current persists up to the shortest pulses of @xmath67s ( @xmath68khz ) , which we investigated .",
    "presence of this component signals formation of gases on this shortest time scale that was directly observed with the stroboscope .",
    "the faradaic current reaches rather large values . for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is @xmath69ma for the single polarity pulses and @xmath70ma for the alternating polarity voltage pulses . keeping in mind that the open area of the electrode was",
    "around @xmath71m@xmath13 one finds that the current density was @xmath72a / cm@xmath13 .",
    "this is the average value of the current density but locally it can be 5 times larger ( see sec .",
    "[ estimates ] ) .",
    "this value is much larger than the maximal value @xmath74a / cm@xmath13 @xcite that can be reached in the long - time electrolysis .",
    "the most important conclusions that can be drawn from the current - voltage behavior of the microsystem on the short - time scale are the following .",
    "( i ) the electrolysis persists normally up to the shortest investigated time @xmath67s .",
    "( ii ) the current density is at least two orders of magnitude larger than was previously observed in the macrosystems .",
    "the stroboscopic technique gives images that were made for different runs . to make conclusions from these images the system has to behave reproducibly from run to run . for our system",
    "this condition was fulfilled .",
    "the images made at the same moment for different runs were hardly distinguishable on the short - time scale and varied slightly on the long - time scale @xmath75ms . in the latter case",
    "the positions and sizes of separate bubbles were slightly different but qualitatively the pictures were the same . for good visibility we used typically a @xmath76s long flash of green light that was delayed for different times from the beginning of the voltage pulse .",
    "the camera collected the light from the microscope during the flash . the estimated time uncertainty in 5 @xmath77s is reasonably small although comparable with the time scale .",
    "the gas produced by series of pulses in most cases disappeared diffusively in less than 1 s. sometimes when the amount of produced gas was large a stable ( pinned ) bubble formed . in this case",
    "we have to refill the chip for further use .",
    "due to evaporation we have been able to operate with a filled chip during 15 min .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the electrodes in different moments of time .",
    "a positive or negative voltage pulse of @xmath78s long was applied to the electrodes .",
    "the left image shows both electrodes @xmath79s after beginning of the positive voltage pulse .",
    "oxygen and hydrogen are formed above the working electrode and grounded electrode , respectively .",
    "all the other images show the working electrode with hydrogen in different moments during the negative voltage pulse .",
    "indeed , the periphery of the electrode is a preferable place for bubble nucleation , but one can see some haze in the inner part of the electrode . with our microscope we can reliably resolve bubbles with a diameter of @xmath80 nm . the bubbles forming the haze are smaller .",
    "we are able to see them because they strongly scatter the light .",
    "the diameter of these scattering centers is estimated as @xmath81 nm @xcite where @xmath82 nm is the wavelength of the used led .",
    "these scattering centers fill densely the inner part of the electrode and grow with time .",
    "s after switching on the voltage .",
    "six images on the right show the working electrode in different moments of time when negative voltage is applied to it . the indicated time is taken in the middle of the flash .",
    ", width=302 ]      let us make simple estimates .",
    "for the time @xmath83s the gas molecules can diffuse in the vertical direction off the electrode on the distance @xmath84 where @xmath85m@xmath13/s and @xmath86m@xmath13/s are the diffusion coefficients of hydrogen and oxygen in water .",
    "these values of the diffusion length have to be considered as the upper limits on the bubbles that can be formed during the time @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , it is natural that we can see only nanobubbles during the first @xmath79s of electrolysis .",
    "the relative supersaturation for h@xmath30 or o@xmath30 molecules can be found as follows .",
    "the concentration of @xmath87-th gas in the diffusion layer is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the area of the working electrode and @xmath90 is the number of molecules produced by the electrolysis .",
    "this number is related to the faraday current as @xmath91 ( for h@xmath30 ) , where @xmath92 is the electron charge .",
    "the relative supersaturation is the ratio of the gas concentration to the saturated concentration @xmath93 , which at normal conditions is @xmath94 or @xmath95 for hydrogen or oxygen , respectively .",
    "then we find for the supersaturation @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the current density .",
    "the faradaic current recorded together with the images in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] was @xmath98ma .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to estimate the current density because it is highly nonhomogeneous for the planar electrodes .",
    "we already analyzed the current distribution over the electrode ( see @xcite supplemental ) extracting the information from the observed `` wear '' of the electrodes .",
    "it was found that the current density over the electrode surface can be presented as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the coordinates of a point on the electrode and @xmath102 is the maximal current density .",
    "the function @xmath103 has its average value over the electrode @xmath104 .",
    "the area of the electrode was @xmath105m@xmath13 and we find @xmath106a / cm@xmath13 .",
    "this is an extremely high value in comparison with usual electrolysis and it is realized in the area of active bubble formation as can be seen in fig .",
    "the supersaturation in this area for the time @xmath83s is estimated as @xmath107 these are incredibly large values .",
    "observation of the haze far from the electrode periphery is a signal of homogeneous nucleation of small bubbles .",
    "our estimates of the supersaturation ( [ ss1 ] ) also support this idea . in the classical theory of homogeneous nucleation @xcite the probability to create a bubble of the critical size @xmath108 is given by the exponent @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the surface tension of the liquid and @xmath111 is the pressure difference between gas and liquid .",
    "the pressure in gas @xmath112 must support the high supersaturation in liquid .",
    "it is defined as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the saturated pressure for a gas at normal conditions .",
    "for both h@xmath30 and o@xmath30 gases @xmath115atm and we find @xmath116 for the @xmath87-th gas .    for small supersaturation @xmath117 the critical size",
    "@xmath118 m is large and the exponent in ( [ prob ] ) is incredibly small .",
    "for high supersaturation @xmath119 the critical bubble @xmath120 nm is small and the probability to create a critical bubble , which is able to grow , becomes appreciable .",
    "it is hardly reasonable to make more detailed estimates .",
    "this is because a number of important corrections have to be included in the classical nucleation theory @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that according to ( [ ss ] ) @xmath121 increases with time as @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , starting from some moment after beginning of the electrolysis homogeneous bubble formation is expected .",
    "with the temperature increase as one can see from ( [ prob ] ) the homogeneous bubbling must start earlier and due to the exponential dependence this tendency must be well pronounced .",
    "this prediction is very easy to check experimentally doing water electrolysis at elevated temperatures .",
    "s ( top row ) and at @xmath123s ( bottom row ) taken at different temperatures .",
    "a negative voltage pulse of @xmath79s long was the applied to the electrode .",
    "hydrogen nano and microbubbles are visible .",
    ", width=302 ]    for this experiment we heated the chip by a flat resistor and controlled the temperature by a thermocouple .",
    "a @xmath79s long negative voltage pulse was applied to the working electrode .",
    "images shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] were taken at the moments @xmath124s ( top row ) just before the pulse end and at @xmath123s ( bottom row ) @xmath125s after the end of the pulse .",
    "some chemical remnants are clearly visible on the electrode surface .",
    "they appeared due to imperfections in the fabrication process and visualize the area with the reduced ability for gas production .",
    "the temperature increase resulted in the increase of the faraday current from @xmath126ma at @xmath127c up to @xmath128ma at @xmath129c .",
    "this increase is expected due to the increase of the ions diffusion coefficients .",
    "however , the increase of the bubble visibility and speed up of the dynamics are much more prominent .",
    "increase of the solution conductivity ( or equivalently current ) with temperature was checked independently by measuring the conductivity of the bulk solution with mettler toledo sevenmulti conductivity meter .",
    "we have found that the conductivity can be well described by the linear behavior @xmath130 $ ] , where @xmath131 is the conductivity at temperature @xmath132 .",
    "the thermal coefficient was found to be @xmath133k@xmath134 .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with the value @xmath135k@xmath134 found from the current increase on the chip and with the values reported in different literature sources .",
    "comparing the images in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] one can see that much more nanobubbles becomes visible with the temperature increase . on the other hand",
    ", the gas volume at @xmath129c must be approximately twice larger than at @xmath127c as follows from the current increase .",
    "it has the following explanation . at higher temperature",
    "the nucleation of critical bubbles happened earlier and to the moment @xmath124s much more bubbles had enough time to grow to a visible size . at @xmath127c",
    "most of the bubbles are small enough to be invisible .",
    "it becomes even more clear when one compares the top and bottom rows .",
    "for example , the bottom image at @xmath136c contains much more visible gas than the top image .",
    "however , when the pulse is over there is no gas production anymore and one would expect the equal or the opposite relation between the gas volumes .",
    "there is a very simple and natural explanation for this phenomenon .",
    "the voltage pulse produces a certain amount of gas .",
    "this gas can exist in three forms : molecules dissolved in the liquid , nanobubbles larger than the critical size but smaller than needed to be visible with the stroboscope , and visible nano or microbubbles . if homogeneous nucleation of bubbles happens , then at a certain moment a significant volume of gas is collected in the invisible nanobubbles .",
    "these nanobubbles grow with time and become visible with a delay producing the phenomenon of gas appearing from nothing .",
    "we consider fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and explanations above as a strong support of the idea that in the short - time electrolysis we observe homogeneous formation of bubbles .",
    "let us consider now how transition to the usual long - time electrolysis happens .",
    "a negative or positive voltage pulse of @xmath137s long was applied to the working electrode .",
    "the electrode was observed in different moments of time when the pulse was already switched off .",
    "some results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "it was already clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that nanobubbles growing from nucleus start to coalesce in some moment of time and form microbubbles ( see bottom row in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "fast aggregation becomes possible due to high density of nanobubbles .",
    "now from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] one can see that significant changes happen between the images taken at 100 and @xmath138s .",
    "the following dynamics becomes very slow .",
    "this is especially clear for the images at @xmath139ms and @xmath44ms .",
    "it is expected that the long - time dynamics is controlled by the slow diffusion and slow coalescence .",
    "the images in each row were taken at different moments of time .",
    ", width=302 ]    the main conclusion that one can make from the short - time stroboscopic observations is that the nanobubbles are densely produced in the homogeneous nucleation regime .",
    "they exist for some time in the `` invisible '' form when they are small enough to scatter the light and are invisible for the stroboscope . at later moments they become visible but exist as separate nanobubbles .",
    "later they start to aggregate to form microbubbles that are usually observed in the electrolysis .",
    "extremely high current densities and relative supersaturations are observed .",
    "up to now we discussed only hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that are formed on different electrodes when negative or positive voltage is applied to the working electrode . however , there is a simple but effective procedure that allows formation of bubbles containing mixture of h@xmath30 and o@xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the gas composition can be controlled electrically .",
    "the idea is to use pulses of alternating polarity @xcite . in this case",
    "hydrogen and oxygen will be produced locally above the same spot on the electrode .",
    "if the pulses are short enough to neglect the gas redistribution due to diffusion , then one can expect formation of bubbles containing both gases .    for homogeneous nucleation formation of a bubble containing both gases",
    "is favorable in comparison with two bubbles containing different gases .",
    "this is because even in the regime of homogeneous nucleation there is an energetic barrier to form the critical nuclei . for the second gas",
    "it is easier to diffuse inside of the existing bubble than to overcome the barrier and form a new nuclei .      while the frequency of alternating pulses is not very high the process proceeds similar to that for single polarity pulses .",
    "however , when frequency is higher than @xmath140khz ( at room temperature ) the visible gas suddenly disappears . this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "the figure shows gas developed in the system after @xmath141ms of electrolysis .",
    "negative potential pulses applied to the working electrode ( bottom in each image ) result in h@xmath30 formation above this electrode at different frequencies ( right column ) .",
    "no significant dependence on the frequency is observed .",
    "oxygen formed above the working electrode for positive pulses also does not show frequency dependence ( middle column ) .",
    "the left column shows the situation for the alternating pulses applied to the working electrode . in this case",
    "we observe strong dependence on frequency .",
    "the alternating pulses repeated with the frequency @xmath140khz produce significant amount of gas .",
    "one can see that this gas is collected in bubbles which differ from that in the middle and right columns .",
    "already at @xmath142khz only small volume of gas is observed . at @xmath143khz",
    "practically no gas is visible .        where the gas has disappeared ?",
    "the faraday component of the current depends on frequency very weakly if depends at all . because the pulses of single polarity produce the gas at all frequencies it is difficult to assume that the faraday s law breaks at higher frequencies .",
    "experimentally we established that the gas disappearance is related to the stoichiometric production of hydrogen and oxygen .",
    "there is no visible gas production while positive and negative halves of the pulse have the same duration . in this case two",
    "h@xmath30 molecules are produced for one o@xmath30 molecule .",
    "if we change the relative duration of the positive and negative parts of the pulse then the stoichiometric balance will be broken . in this case",
    "the gas reappeared in the system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in this figure @xmath11 is the duty cycle of the pulse that is the fraction of time when voltage on the working electrode is negative .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the gas disappears due to a chemical reaction between gases happening in the solution .",
    "the reaction is hardly possible between separate dissolved gas molecules . for high supersaturation",
    "the molecules exist in the solution only a short time before entering nanobubbles as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "it is possible that the reaction proceeds in nanobubbles containing stoichiometric mixture of h@xmath30 and o@xmath30 .",
    "of course , the bulk mixture of gases at room temperature and normal pressure will not react , but the gases confined in a small volume could behave differently . it is known that below a certain size , material properties can change drastically @xcite .",
    "for example , the surface tension can support metastable phases of nanocrystals @xcite that exist only at high pressure for bulk materials . in liquids the surface tension results in significant pressure inside of nanobubbles . this pressure can shift the chemical equilibrium @xcite and it is known also that fast dynamical processes play role for ignition of the reaction on the macroscale @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the precise mechanism of the reaction is not clear at this moment .",
    "s of processing at @xmath143khz for different duty cycles @xmath11 of alternating polarity pulses . when the working electrode is equal time at positive and negative potential ( @xmath144 ) no gas is visible .",

    "this regime is realized only when the bubbles are homogeneously produced nearby the electrode surface .",

    "they grow to nanobubbles of the size @xmath176 nm close to the limit of stroboscopic visibility . at longer time the separate nanobubbles start to aggregate to form microbubbles . already at @xmath177s",

    "small increase of the temperature on @xmath178 degrees strongly intensify the bubble nucleation and grows as it should be for homogeneous bubble production . at higher temperature",
    "the microbubbles appeared already at @xmath179s or even earlier .    when all the gas is collected in microbubbles the supersaturation in the surrounding liquid",

    "the second half of the pulse produces o@xmath30 molecules in the same location above the electrode , but for oxygen it is energetically preferable to diffuse in the existing hydrogen bubble than to form a new o@xmath30 bubble .",
    "this is why the alternating polarity pulses produce bubbles containing mixture of hydrogen and oxygen .",
    "this mixture is stoichiometric if positive and negative halves of the pulse have the same duration .",
    "if a hydrogen bubble has grown large enough before oxygen starts to diffuse inside , then such a bubble evolves similarly to the bubbles containing only one gas .",

    "the gas mixture in the bubble becomes stoichiometric while its size is still under @xmath2 nm . it was established ( see also @xcite ) that in such a bubble hydrogen and oxygen react spontaneously with the bubble disintegration due to large released energy .",

    "the most distinctive feature for all transient nanobubbles is their homogeneous production in the electrochemical process .",
