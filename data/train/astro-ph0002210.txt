    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "an important characteristic of the emision gas is its spatial scale .",
    "the sizes of the  emission region range from @xmath4 to 120kpc ( van  ojik 1997 ) .",
    "most ground work on hzrg is performed at rather low resolution ( @xmath5 ) to maximize the probability of line detection and the s / n .",
    "however a very potent discovery was made by van  ojik  ( 1997 , hereafter vo97 ) at much higher resolution , that of extended  _ absorption _ gas . in effect , out of 18 hzrg spectra taken at the unusually high resolution of @xmath63 , vo97 found in 60% of the objects deep absorption troughs superimposed on the ly@xmath7 emission profiles .",
    "furthermore , out of the 10 radio galaxies smaller than 50kpc , strong  absorption is found in 9 of them .",
    "the absorption gas appears to have a covering factor near unity over very large scales , namely as large as the underlying emission gas .",
    "the current paper addresses the problem of the ionization state of both the absorption and the emission gas as well as the interconnection between the two .",
    "the main justifications behind this work are the following : hzrg are probably the progenitors of the massive central cluster galaxies ( pentericci et  al .",
    "1999 ) and as such are an important means by which we can study large ellipticals and their environment at such high redshift , a time not so long after , or even during their formation .",
    "furthermore , the extended gas as detected in  ( see below ) is chemically enriched and therefore represents debris of past intense stellar formation periods and is interesting to study in their own right .",
    "what is the fate of such gas ? how quickly has the enrichment of this large scale gas proceeded ? will this gas be heated up into a hot wind and enrich the intergalactic x - ray gas in cluster of galaxies ? will it on the contrary condense into sheets or condensations",
    "? a better understanding of the various gaseous phases which co - exist in high redshift objects would help anwering these questions .    to determine the physical conditions of the absorption gas ,",
    "new observations were carried out at the wavelength of  and  in 0943242 , the first radio galaxy reported to show large scale absorption troughs ( rttgering et  al .",
    "1995 , hereafter ro95 ) .",
    "the new spectrum shows the  absorption doublet at the same redshift and @xmath8 , respectively . ] @xmath9 as the absorption trough ( ro95 ) .",
    "clearly and surprisingly the gas in absorption is highly ionized and probably of comparable excitation to the gas seen in emission .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . we first present observations which show  in absorption in 0943242 ( sect",

    "[ hypo ] we derive a ratio ( ) relating the observed emission and absorption quantities which depends somewhat on the ionization fraction of h but not explicitely on the c / h metallicity ratio . at first",
    ", we postulate that the emission and absorption gas components are co - spatial and share the same excitation mechanism and physical conditions and proceed to model  with a one - zone equilibrium photoionization model .",
    "we improve on the model using a stratified photoionized slab .",
    "as the observed ratio can not be reproduced even in the case of collisional ionization , we discuss in sect .",
    "[ intergam ] two alternative interpretations of this significant discrepancy .",
    "we demonstrate the many advantages of the winning scenario in which the absorption gas is further out and of much lower density , pressure and metallicity than the emission gas .",
    "the low resolution spectrum of 0943242 shown in ro95 and discussed also in van  ojik et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) displays the characteristic emission lines of a distant radio galaxy : strong , weaker ,  and possibly .",
    "this object was also observed at intermediate resolution ( 1.5 ) by ro95 in the region of  with the slit positioned along the radio axis .",
    "the initial discovery of extended absorption troughs was based on this latter spectrum which we reproduce in fig .",
    "[ fig : lya ] .      with the objective of providing constraints on the abundances and kinematics of the gas in 0943242 , sensitive high - resolution spectroscopic observations centered at the  and  lines were performed at the anglo australian telescope ( aat ) on 1995 march 31 and april 1 under photometric conditions and with a seeing which varied from 1to 2 .",
    "the rgo spectrograph was used with a 1200 grooves mm@xmath13 grating and a tektronix 1024@xmath14 thinned ccd , yielding projected pixel sizes of @xmath15 .",
    "the projected slit width was 1.3 , resulting in a resolution as measured from the copper - argon calibration spectrum of 1.5  fwhm ; the slit was oriented at a position angle of 74@xmath16 , i.e. along the radio axis ( as in ro95 ) .",
    "the total integration time of 25000s was split into 2@xmath172000s and 7@xmath173000s exposures in order to facilitate removal of cosmic rays .",
    "exposure times were chosen to ensure that the background was dominated by shot noise from the sky rather than ccd readout noise . between observations",
    "the telescope was moved , shifting the object slit by about 3 spatial pixels , so that for each exposure the spectrum was recorded on a different region of the detector .",
    "the individual spectra were flat - fielded and sky - subtracted in a standard way using the long - slit package in the noao reduction system iraf .",
    "the precise offsets along the slit were determined using the position of the peak of the spatial profile of the  and  lines . using these offsets ,",
    "the images were registered using linear interpolation and summed to obtain the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the resultant seeing in the final two - dimensional spectrum , measured from two stars on the slit , was 1.5  fwhm .",
    "the corresponding fwhm of  emission along the slit was 2.2 , giving a deconvolved ( gaussian ) width of 1.6  or 12kpc . within the errors , this is the same as that found for  emission by ro95 .",
    "the two - dimensional spectrum was weighted summed over a 7 pixel ( 5 ) aperture to obtain a one - dimensional spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] we show the aat data in the form of a full - resolution spectrum .",
    "one deep trough is observed in the  emission line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lya ] ) which was interpreted as a large scale absorber by ro95 .",
    "in addition there are a number of weaker troughs , presumably due to weak  absorption .",
    "fitting the emission line by a gaussian and the  absorption by voigt profiles , ro95 infer a column density  of @xmath18  for the deep trough , a redshift @xmath19 and a doppler parameter @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "for the three shallow troughs , they find  ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23  and @xmath20 ranging from 7 to 100 .",
    "the redshift difference of the absorbers relative to systemic velocity when converted into inflow / outflow velocities indicate values not exceeding 800 . because at the bottom of the main trough no emission is observed , the covering factor of the absorbing gas must be equal or larger than unity over the complete area subtended by the  emission , indicating that the spatial scale of the absorber exceeds 13kpc .",
    "this work will concern only the deep absorption trough .    to parameterize the  profile we have assumed that the underlying emission line is gaussian , with voigt profiles due to the  doublet absorption superimposed .",
    "we used an iterative scheme that minimizes the sum of the squares of the difference between the model and the observed spectrum , thereby solving for the parameters of the model ( e.g.  webb 1987 , vo97 ) .",
    "initial values were assumed for the shape of the gaussian profile and the redshift of the absorber .    .[ta : parameters]parameters for the gaussian and voigt profile fits [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig.[fig : civfit ] we show a portion of the spectrum with the model fits superimposed .",
    "the gaussian fitted to the  emission line peaks at @xmath24 and has a fwhm of @xmath25 .",
    "we have corrected all wavelengths to the vacuum heliocentric system ( @xmath26 + 1.13 ) before computing the redshifts .",
    "the two troughs in this figure correspond to the   doublet produced by the same absorption system .",
    "therefore , within the fitting procedure , the wavelength separation and the ratio of the two profiles depths are fixed by atomic physics while the two values for @xmath20 are set to be equal .",
    "the fit gives for the location of the bottoms of the two troughs @xmath27 6068.2 and 6078.3  resulting in a redshift of 2.9202 @xmath28 0.0002 . within the errors this redshift is equivalent to that of the main  absorber and in the subsequent analysis we will assume that the  and  _ absorption _ gas belongs to the same absorber .",
    "we derive a doppler parameter @xmath20 for the doublet of @xmath29 and a column density  of 10@xmath30 as summarized in table  [ ewciv ] .",
    "as expected ,  appears only in emission without any absorption since it is not a resonance line .",
    "parameters for the  emission profile were obtained by fitting a gaussian using the same iterative scheme ( see fig .  1 in rttgering & miley 1997 ) .",
    "the peak is positioned at @xmath31 and has a fwhm of @xmath32 .",
    "the fitted parameters of the emission and absorption profiles are presented in table  [ ewciv ] .",
    "we recall that the fwhm of the  emission profile is @xmath33 ( vo97 ) , significantly larger than that of   ( see table  [ ewciv ] ) .",

    "[ fig : lya ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] ( or fig .",
    "[ fig : civfit ] ) suggests the presence of an excess flux on the blue wings of all the emission profiles . combining information from all the emission lines ,",
    "our best estimate of the emission gas redshift is @xmath34 .      to investigate whether there is any velocity shear in the emission profile we fitted spatial gaussian profiles to the emission line as a function of wavelength . in fig .",
    "[ fig : relloc ] we show the wavelength maxima of these spatial profiles and a line fitted through these points .",
    "the spatial profile of the  emission spectrum is displaced by 0.2 , corresponding to a displacement of 1.5 kpc , over a wavelength range of 50 .",
    "ro95 measured a comparable shift for  of 1.8 kpckpc is to be preferred to that quoted by ro95 of 2.5kpc . ]",
    "although it appears that the latter displacement is due to a far more pronounced and abrupt difference in locations of the  peak on both sides of the absorption trough .",
    "as fig.[fig : relloc ] shows , the peaks of  emission form a wavy line .",
    "we believe the velocity shear in the civ profile to be less significant than the shear in the  profile .",
    "we can not rule out that the small velocity shear might be masking a possible break up of the absorption regions into a few saturated absorption components of smaller @xmath20 .",
    "a concern about the determination of  is the possibility that that there exist subcomponents in the absorption systems that have high column densities but low @xmath20 values and are , therefore , not acounted for whenever individual velocity subcomponents are not resolved .",
    "although we can not strictly exclude this possibility , we adopt the stand of jenkins ( 1986 ) and steidel ( 1990a ) who , using extensive absorption line studies , argue that this is unlikely to be the case , at least for , and that a single - component curve - of - growth analysis can be used to infer total columns although the inferred _ effective _ @xmath20 value has no physival meaning in terms of temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that the physical conditions inferred from the  fit are fully consistent with the observed ratio of the doublet ( since both troughs are equally well fitted ) .",
    "if the underlying continuum was flat , the  column and the @xmath20 value we infer would imply a theoretical ratio of equivalent widths of @xmath35 , which is where the curve of growth just begins to leave the linear part ( steidel 1990a ) .",
    "clearly the  column might be susceptible to a larger error since  is saturated . with these caveats in mind",
    ", we will assume in the following analysis that the adopted columns do not lie far off from reality .",
    "our initial hypothesis is that the absorption gas is a subcomponent of the emission gas , sharing the same excitation mechanism and metallicity .",
    "we discuss the physical conditions of such gas and proceed to calculate an observable quantity , , against which to compare the information provided by the  and  lines in 0943242 .",
    "the  and  lines are both resonant lines and therefore prone to be seen in absorption against a strong underlying source .",
    "this property has consequences for the emission gas as well . in effect , for a geometry consisting of many condensations for which the cumulative covering factor approaches unity , the resonant line photons must scatter many times in between the condensations before they can escape . in this case , the emerging flux of any resonant line from a non uniform distribution of gas will not in general be an isotropic quantity but will depend on geometrical factors and on the relative orientation of the observer , a point which we now develop further .",
    "we propose that some kind of asymmetry within the emission gas distribution can explain how a fraction of the ionized gas can be seen in absorption against other nearby components in emission .",
    "let us suppose that the emission region is composed of low filling factor ionized gas condensations which are denser ( therefore brighter ) towards the nuclear ionizing source . in this picture ,",
    "the  or  photons are generated within and escape from such condensations , after which they start scattering on the surface of neighboring condensations until final escape from the galaxy ( we assume that the cumulative covering factor is unity ) .",
    "let us now suppose an asymmetry in the global distribution of the outer condensations respective to the plane of the sky . in this case , the total number of scatterings on neighboring condensations before final escape will differ depending on the perspective of the absorber . since for an observer situated on the side with an excess of condensations",
    "many of the resonant photons would have been ` reflected ' away , we expect that the reduced flux would appear as an absorption line at the same velocity as that of the condensations responsible for reflecting away the resonant photons .",
    "the outer condensations ( responsible for the absorption ) must necessarily be of lower density in order to be of negligible emissivity respective to the inner ( denser and therefore brighter ) emission gas , otherwise the outer gas would out - shine in emission !",
    "we should point out that for a density of the absorption gas as high as 100  as argued for in vo97 , such a gas can not be photoionized by the metagalactic background radiation which would be much too feeble to produce .",
    "the ionization to such a degree of the absorption gas is in itself puzzling .",
    "we adopt as working hypothesis that it is similarly to the emission gas photoionized by the agn or by the hard radiation from photoionizing shocks .",
    "finally , the fact that both the absorption and emission gas contain a significant amount of c@xmath36 argues in favor of a common geometry and excitation mechanism for the gas , the underlying hypothesis behind the calculations developed below .",
    "the quantities determined from observation of 0943242 are the following : the emission line ratio measured by rttgering et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) is @xmath37 .",

    "[ observ ] .",
    "these four quantities carry information on the three ionization species h@xmath40 , h@xmath41 and c@xmath36 .",
    "we define the ratio  as the following product of the emission and absorption ratios :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the ratio of the measured absorption columns .",
    "if , as postulated above , the gas responsible for absorption is simply a subset of the line emitting gas , the ratio  does not explicitly depend on the abundance of carbon as shown below .      to compute , in a first stage let us consider an homogeneous slab of thickness @xmath44 of uniform gas density , temperature and ionization state to represent both the gas in emission and in absorption . ignoring any peculiar scattering effects ,",
    "the emission line ratio @xmath45 is given by the ratio of the local emissivities @xmath46 since the slab is homogeneous .",
    "for the emissivity of the  line , we have    @xmath47    ( osterbrock 1989 ) where @xmath48 is the temperature , @xmath49 the collision strength of the combined doublet , @xmath50 the statistical weight of the ground state and @xmath51 the mean energy of the excited level .",
    "for the  emissivity , we have    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the effective recombination coefficient rate to level @xmath54 of h ( osterbrock 1989 ) . by putting the temperature dependence and all the atomic constants in the function @xmath55 ,",
    "the emission line ratio becomes :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the total hydrogen density ,  the carbon abundance relative to h of the emission gas , @xmath58 the fraction of triply ionized c and @xmath59 the ionization fraction of h.    the ratio of column densities /  can be written as :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the neutral fraction of h inside our homogeneous slab and  the carbon abundance of the _ absorption _ gas .",
    "as we are testing the case which equates the absorption gas with the emission gas , then @xmath62 .",
    "we denote as  the product of the two calculated ratios :    @xmath63    we note that  is not directly dependent on either the abundance of c or on its ionization state .",
    "it is , however , dependent on the temperature and on the ionization state of h through the ratio . ]",

    "we conclude that for the simple one - zone case ,  consistently remains below the observed value by more than two orders of magnitude .      to verify whether a stratified slab geometry might alter the above discrepancy in , we have calculated in a similar fashion to bergeron & stasiska ( 1986 ) and steidel ( 1990b ) the internal ionization and temperature structure of a slab photoionized by radiation impinging on one - side ( i.e. one - dimensional `` outward only '' radiation transfer ) using the code .",

    ", there exists an indirect dependence of  on the _ total _ metallicity given that the equilibrium temperature is governed by collisional excitation of metal lines ( when @xmath78 ) .    the striking result from the slab calculations in fig .",
    "[ omeg ] is that the models with solar metallicity are still two order of magnitudes below the observed .",
    "another way of looking at this discrepancy is to consider separately the @xmath79 emission ratio or the @xmath80 column ratio .",
    "forgetting , just to achieve the observed column of  ( @xmath81 ) , one would have to use a gas metallicity below solar by a factor @xmath82 ( see sequence with @xmath83 ) , which can not be done without irremediably weakening the  _ emission _ line to oblivion .",

    ".    might the observed @xmath85 emission line ratio be anomalous ?",

    "another possibility to consider is the presence of other heating sources such as shocks which would increase the temperature above the equilibrium temperature given by photoionization alone .",
    "alternatively , small condensations in rapid expansion would result in strong adiabatic cooling and the temperature would be less than given by cooling from line emission alone . to explore such cases ,",
    "we have calculated various isothermal photoionized slabs of different ( but uniform ) temperatures ( all with @xmath86 ) .",

    "what is the significance of the obvious discrepancy between models and the observed ? clearly , the working hypothesis that the emitting and absorption gas phases are physically the same , is now ruled out and an alternative explanation must be sought for , based on our result that the two gas phases ( absorption vs. emission ) are physically distinct .",
    "we consider the two following explanations in sect .  [ large ] and [ twophase ] .",
    "since the absorption gas in this picture is not spatially associated with the emission gas , its metallicity is unconstrained .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath88 is easily reproduced by simply using @xmath89 in the one - zone case ( see eqs  [ eqemi ] and [ eqabs ] ) .",
    "the more rigorous stratified slab geometry would favor a value of @xmath90 to reproduce the same , assuming both gas phases to have equal excitation .",

    "we can not rely on the emission spectra alone to derive a precise and independent value for  as the emission lines are very model - dependent , with fluxes from lines like  depending critically on the temperature .",
    "it can realistically be argued , however , that a  less than half solar could _ not _ reproduce the observed metal line ratios . on the other hand ,",
    "a  much higher than solar can not be ruled out in absence of direct knowledge of the ionizing continuum distribution .",
    "we consider more plausible a near solar value for on the ground that the extended emission lines extend over 13kpc and therefore sample a huge galactic region very distinct from that of the nucelar blr ( hidden here ) which has been shown to be ultra - solar in high @xmath91 qsos ( hamann & ferland 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "an attempt , on the other hand , to model separately the absorption columns observed in 0943242 as described below in sect .",
    "[ metal ] is more dependable since temperature is much less of an issue .",
    "the value inferred below of @xmath92 is consistent with those observed in absorbers of comparable redshift along the line of sight of more distant qsos ( steidel 1990a ) . since measured galactic metallicity gradients",
    "are always negative and a function of the distance to the nucleus , such a contrast in metallicity between absorption and emission gas makes more sense if the absorption gas is located much further out than the emission gas which extends to at least 13kpc in 0943242 .",
    "we emphasize that this scenario does not entail that the absorption gas does not belong to the environment of the parent radio galaxy .",
    "as argued by vo97 , the high frequency of detection of  aborbers in 9 out of 10 radio galaxies _ smaller _ than 50kpc , much in excess of the density of absorbers along any line of sight to distant qsos , is a compelling argument for concluding that the absorption gas is spatially related to the parent galaxy .",
    "our postulate is that the large scale  _ absorption _ gas is the same gas which is seen instead in _ emission _ in those radio galaxies with  sizes _ larger _ than 50kpc . in effect ,",
    "absorption troughs are not seen when the emission gas extends beyond 50kpc .",
    "such objects in general also have much larger radio sizes as shown by vo97 .",
    "kinematically , the gas which is seen in emission at the largest spatial scales shows narrow fwhm .",
    "for instance a reresentative case is the radio galaxy 1243 + 036 ( @xmath93 ) which was studied in great detail by van ojik et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) and which reveals the presence of very faint  emission extending up to 136kpc , a region labelled `` outer halo '' .",
    "this emission gas has a fwhm of 250  and shows clear evidence for rotational support .",
    "a straightforward explanation of why the same gas is seen in emission in some objects while in absorption in others might simply be the environmental pressure . a larger pressure , like the one adopted by vo97 can cause the warm gas to condense and hence reduce his filling factor as compared to similar gas components in a low pressure environment . due to this process",
    ", high pressures and consequently high densities lead to detectable  since emissivities scale proportionally to @xmath1 , but also to an overall smaller covering factor ( hence no detectable absorption ) while low pressures lead to large covering factors ( hence absorption ) as well as negligible emissivities .",
    "differences in pressure in the outer halo would therefore naturally account for the reported dichotomy of detecting  troughs exclusively in those emission  objects devoid of very large scale emission ( @xmath94kpc )    since absorption troughs tend to be absent in radio galaxies showing the largest radio scales , we propose that the gas which is seen in absorption must lie _ outside _ the zone of influence of the radio jet cocoon , a region with pressure of order @xmath95 ( vo97 ) . an unpressurized outer halo responsible for the absorption troughs ought to precede the regime in which the radio material has expanded sufficiently outward to pressurize the outer halo . the eventual increase in environmental pressure",
    "would either disrupt the gas or compresses it into small clumps ( making it unobservable in absorption when the covering factor dwindles ) , which becomes visible in emission if it lies within the ionizing cone .",
    "vo97 assumed that the absorption and emission gas were both immersed in zones of comparable surrounding pressure ( @xmath96 ) and were therefore of comparable density ( @xmath97  for a photoionized gas ) .",
    "we propose instead that whenever aborption troughs are observed , the absorption gas must lie outside the radio jet cocoon , allowing for a lower density and high covering factor .",
    "the clear - cut advantages of locating the  absorber in an unpressurized outer halo are threefold :    1 .   we can now get the high excitation of the low density absorption gas for free . in effect , if the density of the absorption gas is as low as @xmath98@xmath99 , the metagalactic background radiation suffices to photoionize the absorption gas to the high degree observed in 0943242 , whether it does or does not lie within the ionizing cone of the nucleus .",
    "conversely , for the objects devoid of absorption , when a higher pressure has set in in the outer halo ( as we presume to be the case in 1243 + 036 ) , the gas is much denser and can be seen in emission only if it lies whithin the ionizing cone ( since a high density gas of @xmath100  can not be kept highly ionized by the background metagalactic radiation ) .",
    "this picture would be in accord with the findings of van ojik et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) who detect in emission in 1243 + 036 only along the radio axis ( presumably the same axis as that of the ionizing radiation cone ) and _ not _ in the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "2 .   the much smaller velocity dispersion ( @xmath101 ) of the absorption gas as compared to the emission gas ( fwhm@xmath102 , cf . table  [ ewciv ] ) is more readily explained if the absorption gas lies undisturbed at relatively large distances from the parent galaxy .",
    "it explains why the absorption ( yet ionized ) gas in 0943242 is not seen in emission while being more massive than the inner emission  gas observed within 13kpc . in effect , the mass of ionized gas either in emission or absorption around 0943242 inferred by vo97 are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . adopting the conservative value of @xmath105 ( cf .",
    "panel  b in fig .",
    "[ omeg ] ) , the total ionized mass of the absorption ionized gas therefore exceed that of the inner emission gas by at least a factor two and yet it is not seen in emission ! this huge pool of ionized gas can remain undetectable in emission only if it has a very low density , as argued above .",
    "it is customary to assume a volume filling factor of @xmath106 for the gas detected in emission in radio galaxies and that this gas is immersed in a region characterized by a pressure of order @xmath95 ( vo97 ; van ojik 1996 ) .",
    "if we suppose instances where the outer halo has much lower pressure than this , it can be shown that for the same outer halo mass , the luminosity in  would scale inversely to the volume filling factor .",
    "hence , the gas would be weaker in emission by a factor of @xmath106 if its filling factor approached unity ( with the mean density being lower by the same amount ) .",
    "this scheme would easily explain why the outer halo of 0943242 is not seen in emission despite its huge mass ( comparable incidentally to the outer halo mass measured in emission in 1243 + 036 of @xmath107 by ojik et  al .",
    "1996 ) .      due to radiative cooling ( which goes as @xmath1 and rise steeply with @xmath48 ) , density enhancements can condense out of the emitting gas and form a population of about 100 times denser and 100 times cooler clouds in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium .",
    "if we maintain that the pressure characterizing the absorption and the emission gas is comparable ( @xmath108 ) and that either gas phase has a temperature typical of photoionization , @xmath109k , we obtain ( adopting a similar notation to vo97 but adapted to the case of 0943242 ) that the size and the number of small _ homogeneous _ absorbing condensations required to cover the emission region would be @xmath110pc and @xmath111 clouds , respectively , where @xmath112 @xmath113 [ as above we adopt 0.03 as the reference neutral h fraction ] .",
    "can we find an alternative interpretation to ( 1 ) above for explaining the large  that does not require low metallicities for the absorption gas ?",
    "such a possibility would arise if the column was not directly related to the  column . for instance , in the auto - gravitating absorber model of petitjean et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which consists of a self - gravitating gas condensation with a dense neutral core surrounded by photoionized outer layers , could in principle give ratios between columns of  and  which do not reflect the abundance ratio but represents rather the average impact parameter for our line of sight .",
    "of course , these models have to be rescaled to a pressure of @xmath114 implying much smaller sizes but requiring much higher ionizing fluxes ( both by a factor @xmath115 ) .",
    "this rescaling poses no conceptual problems if we assume that the photoionization is by the central agn .",
    "using their figures and table  4 ( petitjean et  al .",
    "1992 ) , we infer that the number of auto - gravitating condensations needed to achieve a covering factor of unity and a mean  column of @xmath38 would have to be large , in excess of @xmath116 , for instance , for the model c@xmath117 .",
    "however , after inspection of the various  columns derived from their extensive grid of models , we did not find any model which would reproduce the observed  column without having a metallicity @xmath118 .",
    "the gain in @xmath119 is therefore insufficient to get @xmath120 and we conclude that this explanation for a high  is unworkable .",
    "our favoured interpretation of the large  is that the absorption gas is of very low metallicity compared to the ( inner / denser ) emission gas .",
    "furthermore , a close parallel in the physical conditions of the absorption gas could be made with those adopted for the study of qso absorbers ( e.g. steidel 1990a , b ; bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) , namely the densities , the metallicities and the excitation mechanism ( photoionization by a hard metagalactic background radiation ) .",
    "the observed  column of @xmath38 would position the 0943242 absorber in the category of `` lyman limit system '' according to steidel ( 1992 ) .",
    "the coincidence in physical conditions might be fortuitous and it does not imply perse a common origin or correspondance between qso absorbers and outer halos of radio galaxies . under the sole assumption of similar physical conditions ,",
    "what estimate of the metallicity can we derive for c ?",
    "from the /  ratio , we can not determine the ionization parameter and therefore directly apply the results and models of steidel ( 1990b ) who determined for each lyman limit system a probable range of  from upper limits or from measurements of other species than .",
    "it is nevertheless reasonable to assume that the excitation degree in 0943242 is comparable to that encountered in high excitation qso absorbers . to determine an appropriate value for",
    ", we adopted the set of data provided by the three lyman limit systems observed in the spectrum of the qso hs1700 + 6416 by vogel & reimers ( 1993 ) who successfully measured the columns of up to 34 ionization species of each of the three elements c , n and o. amongst our @xmath121 model sequence ( sect.[upseq ] ) , we selected the model which had the same  ( @xmath122 ) as vogel & reimers ( 1993 ) and inferred that the observed columns in 0943242 implied that the carbon metallicity of the absorption gas was 1% solar ( that is c / h @xmath123 ) , which is broadly consistent with the range of  values favored in sect.[large ] .      what would be the minimum density assuming the absorption gas to be uniformly distributed ?",
    "if our proposed picture was correct , a representative size for the absorption gas volume is that given by the outer halo as seen in emission in other hzrg .",
    "let us adopt the value measured for 1243 + 036 by van  ojik et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) of 136kpc . assuming the same mean ionization parameter as used above ( 0.007 )",
    ", we derive a total gas column of @xmath124 . hence the mean density for a volume filling factor unity on a scale of the 1243 + 036 outer halo would be @xmath125 which is a value sufficiently low to allow photoionization by the feeble ionizing metagalactic background radiation .",
    "our estimate of the metallicity for the outer halo of 0943242 is at odds with the super - solar metallicities ( e.g. hamann 1997 , papovich et  al .",
    "2000 ) of the `` associated '' absorbers seen in high redshift qsos .",
    "the qso emission gas itself ( the blr ) is similarly characterized by super - solar metallicities ( cf .",
    "hamann & ferland 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "if we consider qsos and hzrg as equivalent phenomena observed at different angles , it may appear at first surprizing that the metallicities of the absorption components are so different .",
    "however , we show below that this contradiction is only apparent as we are probably dealing with totally different gas components",
    "_ kinematics . _",
    "the hzrg large scale absorbers are kinematically very quiescent . in effect , the modulus of the velocity offset between the absorbers and the parent galaxy is usually less than 400  for the dominant absorber ( vo97 ) ( dey 1999 ) . ] . a substantial fraction of hzrg absorbers",
    "are actually infalling ( binette et  al .",
    "this is far from being the case for qso `` associated '' absorbers whose ejection velocities can extend up to many thousands  ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) . for instance , the two associated systems ( with detected metal lines ) recently studied by papovich et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) are blueshifted by 680 and 4900 , respectively .",
    "selection effect .",
    "_ qsos are spatially unresolved with a size of the source light beam less than a few light - weeks across . in the case of hzrg absorbers ,",
    "the backgound source is the emission gas which extends over a scale @xmath126kpc .",
    "this huge difference in scale results in a totally different bias on what is preferentially observed . in effect , the extended absorbers of hzrg are weighted towards the largest volumes and hence towards the most massive gas components ( the total mass of the absorption component exceeds @xmath127 in 0943242 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the case of qso associated absorbers , the mass of gas directly seen in absorption is tiny ( e.g. @xmath128 if one considers a background light beam one light - month diameter and a total gas absorption column of @xmath129 ) .",
    "coexistence with the blr .",
    "_ to the extent that qso associated absorbers represent gas components expelled from the blr , we should not be surprized that their metallicity turn out comparable to the blr .",
    "given that in hzrg we do not directly see the pointlike agn , we can not expect to see any blr component in absorption .",
    "as for the extended gas detected in hzrg , there exists no evidence in favour of super - solar metallicities on large scales @xmath130kpc  (  when detected is strong only in the nucleus ) if a fraction of associated absorbers correspond to intervening galaxies close to the qso , we might expect to see amongst counterpart hzrgs one or more  or  absorbers of small spatial extent relative to the size of the extended emission gas .",
    "the weak  absorption found by chambers et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) in 4c41.17 might be such occurrence given its partial coverage of the  background .",
    "we conclude that hzrg absorbers , when their size is comparable to galactic halos ( as those found by vo97 ) , have probably little to do with qso associated absorbers . a more suitable analogy to the absorption gas of hzrg is that of the francis cluster of galaxies at @xmath131 which is characterized by large scale absorption gas on a scale of @xmath132mpc ( francis et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the size of the radio source can be used as a clock that measures the time elapsed since the start of the radio activity .",
    "a number of observed characteristics of distant radio galaxies change as a function of radio size ,  ie . as function of time elapsed ( cf .",

    "only the smaller radio galaxies are affected by  absorption ( vo97 ) .",
    "all these observations seem to dictate an evolutionary scenario in which the radio jet has a dramatic impact on its environment while advancing on its way out of the host galaxy ( rottgering et  al .",
    "2000 , best et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "the detection of  absorption in radio galaxy 0943242 at the same redshift as the deep  trough observed by ro95 demonstrates that the detected absorption gas is highly ionized .",
    "having assumed that the  and  columns measured from the voigt profile fitting were representative of the dominant gas phase ( by mass ) in the outer halo , we have effectively ruled out that the absorption and emission gas occupy the same position in 0943242 .",
    "we subsequently reassessed the picture proposed by vo97 in which both the large scale emission gas and the absorption gas were of comparable density ( @xmath134 ) . in the former picture ,",
    "the absorption gas was believed to lie outside the agn ionization bicone ( see their fig .",
    "11 in vo97 ) . to ionize the gas to such a degree without using",
    "the agn flux is problematic .",
    "we have proposed an alternative picture in which the absorption gas is of very low metallicity and lies far away ( in the outer halo ) from the inner pressurized radio jet cocoon . since in this new scheme",
    "the density of the absorption gas is expected to be very low , the metagalactic background radiation now suffices to photoionize it .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the absorption gas is now drastically simplified since we do not need over @xmath135 condensations of size @xmath136pc and density @xmath137 to reach a covering factor close to unity .",
    "we can now reach similarly high covering factor using a single or few shells of very low density which have a volume filling factor close to unity ( assuming a density of @xmath138 ) .",
    "it appears to us that the low metallicity inferred ( @xmath139 ) and the proposed location of the absorption gas in 0943242 outside the radio cocoon , in an outer halo which is seen in emission in other radio galaxies ( as in 1243 + 036) strongly suggest that the absorbers existence precedes the observed agn phase .",
    "unless this non - primordial gas has been enriched by still undetected pop iii stars , we consider that it more likely corresponds to a vestige gas phase expelled from the parent galaxy during the initial starburst at the onset of its formation .    if the  doublet was detected in absorption in other radio galaxies with deep  absorption troughs , there are many aspects which would be worth studying .",
    "for instance , how uniform is the excitation of the absorption gas across the region over which it is detected ? is a single phase sufficient ?",
    "this could be tested by an attempt to detect absorption troughs of  or imaging the troughs in  with an integral field spectrograph on an 8-m class telescope .",
