    "accretion discs of black holes have been a subject of intensive observational and theoretical studies for decades . in most of the studies",
    "the discs are treated as purely fluid flows @xcite .",
    "that is their magnetic fields are considered as dynamically weak and not important for the force balance determining the disc structure . on the other , it has been long recognised that mhd - turbulence may hold the key to the nature of the disc viscosity that enables the inflow of matter into the black hole @xcite .",
    "this expectation was confirmed with the discovery of the magneto - rotational instability @xcite that has become now one of the major topics in theoretical and numerical studies of accretion discs . in the simulations of radiatively inefficient discs",
    "they remain relatively weakly magnetized with the magnetization parameter @xmath0 within the main body of the disc and rising up to @xmath1 only near its inner edge and in the plunging region @xcite .",
    "however , cooling accretion flows may well evolve towards the state with @xmath2 where the vertical balance against the gravitational force of the central object is achieved by means of magnetic pressure alone @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is a general consensus that dynamically strong , ordered , poloidal magnetic field is required both for acceleration and collimation of the relativistic jets that are often produced by the astrophysical black hole - accretion disc systems .",
    "such magnetic field is a key ingredient both in the models where the jet is powered by the black hole @xcite and in the models where it is powered by the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the origin of this field is not very clear .",
    "the most popular idea is that it is carried into central parts of the disc - hole system by the accreting flow itself and that the net magnetic flux gradually builds up there during the long - term evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "this is more or less what is observed in recent numerical simulations of radiatively inefficient discs with initially weak poloidal field , @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of magnetic field that can be reached in this way is still unclear , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the most extreme case , where the disc pressure is dominated by ordered poloidal magnetic field is argued by meier as a model for the low / hard state of x - ray binaries .",
    "although much weaker magnetic field is required to explain the observed power of quasar jets within the blandford - znajek theory , the pressure of poloidal magnetic field still has to be of the same order as the radiative pressure at the inner edge of the radiatively supported accretion discs @xcite .",
    "bogovalov and kelner constructed a model of accretion disc where its angular momentum is carried away by a magnetized wind alone and the inflow of matter and magnetic field is driven entirely by the magnetic torque applied to the disc by the wind . these and other results show that the structure of accretion discs with dynamically strong ordered magnetic is a matter of significant astrophysical interest .",
    "general steady - state axisymmetric magnetized dicks are described by a very complex equation of the grad - shafranov type which does not allow general analytic solutions @xcite .",
    "however , the equilibrium models with pure azimuthal ( toroidal ) field are much simpler and can be constructed using the approach developed for unmagnetised discs @xcite .",
    "in fact , the predominant motion in accretion discs is a differential rotation and one would expect the azimuthal magnetic field to dominate in the interior of such discs .",
    "okada et al . constructed a particular exact solution for the problem of equilibrium torus with purely azimuthal magnetic field . in their approach",
    "the paczynski & wiita potential is utilised to introduce the black hole gravity and the flow dynamics is described by the non - relativistic equations .",
    "although this approach seems to work fine in the case of non - rotating black holes , it is no longer satisfactory in the astrophysically important case of rapidly rotating black hole where full relativistic treatment is required . in this paper",
    "we develop the general relativistic theory of magnetized tori around rotating black holes .",
    "our analysis closely follows the one of kozlowski et al . and abramowicz et al .",
    ", including the notation .",
    "even if tori with dynamically strong magnetic fields do not exist in nature the exact solutions presented here can still be useful for numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics , grmhd , which has attracted a lot of interest recently @xcite .",
    "one of the problems with general relativistic computational magnetohydrodynamics is the lack of exact analytic and semi - analytic solutions that could be used to verify computer codes .",
    "the current list of such solutions includes 1 ) the spherical accretion onto a nonrotating black hole with monopole magnetic field where the magnetic field is dynamically passive @xcite , 2 ) the perturbative force - free solution of blandford - znajek , where both the pressure and the inertia of matter is neglected and the black hole rotates slowly , and 3 ) the so - called gammie flow , that is a one - dimensional solution of the weber - davis type that applies only to the equatorial plane of a black hole @xcite .",
    "one may also try to utilize the axisymmetric semi - analytic self - similar solutions constructed recently by meliani et al .",
    "but those apply only along the symmetry axis .",
    "obviously , the magnetized torus solution is very welcome an addition to this scarce list .",
    "in fact , it is the only solution that is not only a ) fully multi - dimensional and b ) involves dynamically important magnetic field , but c ) also applies in the case of a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "in fact , we have already used this solution to test the 2d grmhd codes described in komissarov .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the relativistic units where @xmath3 and @xmath4 signature for the space - time geometry .",
    "following anile the magnetic field is rescaled in such a way that the factor @xmath5 disappears from the equations of relativistic mhd .",
    "the covariant equations of ideal relativistic mhd are    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fluid enthalpy , pressure and 4-velocity of plasma respectively , and @xmath13 is the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "@xmath14    is the faraday tensor and @xmath15 is the 4-vector of magnetic field . in the fluid frame @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the the usual 3-vector of magnetic field as measured in this frame , and thus    @xmath18    in the following we assume that    1 .",
    "the space - time is described by the kerr metric and that @xmath19 are either kerr - schild or boyer - lindquist coordinates , so that + @xmath20 2 .",
    "the flow is both stationary and axisymmetric , so that + @xmath21 + for any physical parameter @xmath22 ; 3 .",
    "the flow is a pure rotation around the black hole , that is + @xmath23 4 .",
    "the magnetic field is purely azimuthal , that is @xmath24    in terms of partial derivatives the continuity equation reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the determinant of the metric tensor . given the symmetry conditions ( [ kerr - m ] ) and ( [ axi - sta ] ) this equation reduces to @xmath27 where here and throughout the whole paper @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the condition ( [ azim - u ] ) tells us that this equation is always satisfied .",
    "since the faraday tensor is antisymmetric one may reduce the faraday equation to @xmath29 it is easy to see that this equation is also automatically satisfied given the conditions ( [ kerr - m]-[azim - b ] ) .",
    "thus , the only non - trivial results follow from the energy - momentum equation ( [ em - eq ] ) . contracting this equation with the projection tensor",
    "@xmath30 we obtain @xmath31    in terms of the angular velocity , @xmath32 and the specific angular momentum @xmath33 ( both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants of geodesic motion ) this equation reads    @xmath36    where    @xmath37    when @xmath38 equation ( [ eq-4 ] ) reduces to equation 7 in abramowicz et al . which describes equilibrium non - magnetic tori .",
    "thus , the lorentz force vanishes and we have a force - free magnetic torus provided @xmath39 far away from the black hole @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and this equation reduces to the familiar @xmath43",
    "for a barotropic equation of state , where @xmath44 equation ( [ eq-4 ] ) leads to @xmath45 in the case of a non - magnetic torus this equations implies that @xmath46 and thus the surfaces of equal @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath11 , and @xmath49 coincide @xcite .",
    "obviously , this does not have to be the case for magnetized tori .",
    "if , however , we still assume that @xmath50 then eq.([eq-6 ] ) can be written as    @xmath51    that implies that the expression of the right - hand side is a total differential .",
    "hence , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the magnetic pressure , and eq.([eq-7 ] ) integrates to give @xmath56    assuming that on the surface of the disc , and hence on its inner edge , @xmath57 one finds the constant of integration as @xmath58 following , abramowicz et al .",
    "we introduce the total potential , @xmath59 , via @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the angular momentum at infinity .",
    "provided that @xmath61 is finite we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 . using the total potential we can rewrite eq.([eq-8 ] ) as @xmath64 with exception for the last term this equation is the same as eq.9 in abramowicz et al . and",
    "eq.24 in kozlowski et al ..",
    "here we adopt particular relationships @xmath65 , @xmath50 , and @xmath66 that allow to express the integrals of equation ( [ eq-11a ] ) in terms of elementary functions .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 the last equation can also be written as @xmath70    then eq.([eq-11a ] ) reduces to @xmath71 where @xmath72    the obvious parameters of the model are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "two more parameters are needed .",
    "we chose these to be the enthalpy , @xmath77 , and the magnetization parameter @xmath78 at the disc centre , @xmath79 . following abramowicz et al .",
    "we define the disc centre as one of the two points in the equatorial plane where @xmath75 equals to the keplerian angular momentum    @xmath80    where the upper sign is used if @xmath81 and the lower sign otherwise @xcite .",
    "the second point is to the disc `` cusp '' , @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "there exist a number of obvious constraints on the values of these parameters .    in order to avoid divergence of the second and/or the fourth terms in ( [ eq-15 ] ) at the disc surface one should have @xmath83 under this condition the disc surface",
    "is fully determined by the choice of @xmath76 and does not depend on the disc magnetization .",
    "this property has already been noticed in okada et al ..    only if @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the radius of the marginally stable keplerian orbit @xcite , the disc is detached from the event horizon ( abramowicz et al . .",
    "solutions attached to the event horizon are improper because they diverge at the event horizon and can not be continued through it . )",
    "the value of @xmath75 determines the total potential which can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( see eq.[eq - a9 ] ) .    if @xmath89 then the disc has finite outer radius only for @xmath90    if @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the angular momentum of the marginally bound keplerian orbit @xcite , then the disc remains detached from the black hole only if @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the value of the total potential at the cusp @xcite .    from eq.([eq-15 ] )",
    "one finds the gas pressure @xmath95 and then the magnetic pressure    @xmath96    at the disc centre .",
    "using these one finds the constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 of the barotropics ( [ eq-13],[eq-14a ] ) .    now one can compute the solution at any location inside the disc .",
    "given the coordinates @xmath99 one computes the potential @xmath59 using equation ( [ eq-18 ] ) . if @xmath100 then this point is inside the disc .",
    "the next step is to find the enthalpy , @xmath10 , as a solution of eq.([eq-15 ] ) .",
    "once @xmath10 is found one can find @xmath11 and @xmath101 from eqs.([eq-13 ] ) and ( [ eq-14a ] ) .",
    "the 4-velocity vector , @xmath102 , is given by @xmath103 where @xmath47 can be found via @xmath104 ( see appendix . )",
    "the 4-vector of magnetic field , @xmath105 , is given by @xmath106 ( see eq.[eq - a13a ] ) .      in order to illustrate the usefulness of this solution for testing grmhd computer codes we constructed two equilibrium models and used them to setup the initial solution for 2d axisymmetric simulations using the code described in komissarov . in both models the black hole has specific angular momentum @xmath107 which gives @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . in both cases",
    ", we used the same value for the barotropic powers @xmath112 and the polytropic equation of state with the same ratio of specific heats , @xmath113 .",
    "the other parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "notice , that @xmath114 in model a , whereas in model b one has @xmath115 and this allows accretion through the torus cusp @xcite .",
    "initially , the space outside of the tori is filled with a rarefied non - magnetic plasma accreting into the black hole .",
    "its density and pressure are @xmath116 its velocity in the frame of local fiducial observer , fido , @xcite is radial and has the magnitude @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the radial component of velocity of the spacial grid relative to fido .",
    "this introduces inflow through the horizon with the local velocity of fidos and at the same time allows only small poloidal velocity jump at the torus surface .",
    "the latter property allows to avoid strong rarefactions that may originate at the torus surface right at the start of simulations .",
    "the initial distributions of @xmath49 , @xmath47 , and @xmath119 for the model a , that is a more extreme case , are shown in figure [ model - a ] .",
    "model b appears very similar .    in these simulations we utilized",
    "the kerr - schild coordinates @xmath99 .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath120\\times [ 0,\\pi]$ ] with 320 cells in each direction . at lower resolution",
    "the effects of numerical diffusion become rather noticeable .",
    "the grid is uniform in the @xmath121-direction and the cell size in the radial direction is such that in the equatorial plane @xmath122 .",
    "this ensures that computational cells have approximately equal lengths in both directions and throughout the whole grid .",
    ".parameters of the models used for test simulations [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the rotational period of the disc centre is rather long @xmath123 in model a and @xmath124 in model b. however , the dynamical timescale , @xmath125 , for the disc centre is significantly shorter .",
    "indeed , in both of these models the fast magnetosonic speed in the disc centre is @xmath126 , whereas the length scale of pressure distribution at this location is @xmath127 .",
    "this gives the dynamical timescale @xmath128 .",
    "since it is the dynamical timescale that determines how quickly the system reacts to perturbations of its equilibrium state , it is quite sufficient to carry out simulations for only @xmath129 in order to test the ability of our numerical code to correctly reproduce these equilibrium solutions . in order to demonstrate this",
    "we have carried out test simulations for model a not only with our `` proper code '' but also with its two corrupted versions . in the first version , it is only the electromagnetic pressure , @xmath130 , that was taken into account in the calculations of the maxwell stress tensor . in the second and more drastic version we omitted all the contributions of the electromagnetic field to the stress - energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ referee ] .",
    "one can see that already at @xmath131 the solutions obtained with the corrupted versions are significantly different from the initial equilibrium solution . with the second corrupted version the disc simply collapses towards the equator due to the lack of magnetic support against gravity .",
    "figure [ referee ] also presents the proper numerical solution at t=200 , which is @xmath132 times larger than @xmath125 .",
    "`` naked eye '' inspection shows that this solution is very similar to the initial equilibrium one that is presented in figure [ model - a ] .",
    "this is confirmed by the 1d density plots showing in details the distributions along and across the symmetry plane : figure [ comp - a ] for model a and figure [ comp - b ] for model b. other images also reveal what appears to be surface waves propagating away from the black hole and becoming noticeable in the more remote parts of the tori .",
    "in this paper we have generalized the relativistic theory of thick accretion discs around kerr black holes @xcite by including dynamically strong toroidal ( azimuthal ) magnetic field .",
    "as expected , this inclusion of magnetic field leads to a whole new class of equilibrium solutions that differ in strength and spacial distribution of the field .",
    "in particular , we have described the way of constructing barotropic tori with constant angular momentum  under such conditions the differential equations of magnetostatics are easily integrated and reduce to simple algebraic equations .    by",
    "now it has become clear that magnetic field plays many important roles in the dynamics of astrophysical black hole - accretion disc systems",
    ". however , the structure of this field may be more complex than just azimuthal loops and as the result the analytic solutions constructed in this paper may turned out not to be particularly suitable for modelling real astrophysical objects . even so they will be certainly helpful in testing computer codes for general relativistic mhd that are becoming invaluable tools in the astrophysics of black holes / accretion discs .",
    "this research was funded by pparc under the rolling grant `` theoretical astrophysics in leeds ''                                as to the third term in ( [ eq - a1 ] ) , @xmath144 during this reduction we twice used the symmetry conditions .",
    "substituting of results ( [ eq - a2]-[eq - a4 ] ) into eq.([eq - a1 ] ) leads to @xmath145 which is equation ( [ eq-1 ] ) of the main paper .",
    "these allow to write @xmath156 and @xmath157 now we reduce the terms @xmath158 and @xmath159 in equation ( [ eq - a5 ] ) . using the definitions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 one",
