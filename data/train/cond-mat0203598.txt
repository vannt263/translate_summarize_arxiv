    "the values of @xmath176 and @xmath177 may be expressed in terms of the normal pressure @xmath178 that acts between the bodies at @xmath167  @xcite : @xmath179 for simplicity we assume that the colliding particles are of the same material . the normal pressure @xmath180",
    "is related to the total normal force @xmath181 @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath90 are the semi  axes of the contact ellipse .",
    "the latter values as well as the compression @xmath172 may be found from the set of equations    @xmath184    from the above expressions follows that for all bodies in contact having smooth surfaces ( in the mathematical sense ) the total force and the deformation are related via the power law @xmath185 the constant @xmath186 depends on the elastic properties of the materials and on the local curvatures of the colliding bodies .",
    "for the case of the spherical particles one has the hertz s law @xmath187 using this relation between force and deformation and the equation of motion ( eq .  ( [ gn1 ] ) )",
    "one can describe the elastic collision completely .",
    "the duration of the collision is  ( @xcite ) @xmath188    in the solution of the elastic contact problem the displacement fields @xmath189 and @xmath190 are completely defined by the value of @xmath181 and thus by the value of the deformation @xmath42 .",
    "hence we write @xmath191 , i.e. the displacement field depends explicitly on the compression .",
    "therefore we obtain for the velocity of the displacement in the quasistatic approximation @xmath192 and correspondingly for the dissipative part of the stress tensor @xmath193 we emphasize that the expression in the curled brackets in the above equation coincides with the elastic stress , provided the viscous constants are substituted by the elastic ones . the latter expression for the dissipative stress tensor is written for the case when the memory effects in the viscous processes may be neglected .",
    "a more general case is discussed in appendix  [ appendixb ] .",
    "the @xmath194 component of the elastic stress is equal to the normal pressure @xmath180 at the plane @xmath167 , @xmath195 with the transformation of the coordinate axes    @xmath196    and    @xmath197    we obtain @xmath198 applying the operator @xmath199 to the previous expression we obtain the result for the viscous stress . integrating the viscous stress over the contact area we finally find for the dissipative component of the inter ",
    "particles force @xmath200 thus one obtains for the normal force which acts between the viscoelastic bodies in the quasistatic regime of collision @xmath201 the constant in eq .",
    "( [ 43 ] ) coincides with that for the elastic force . for colliding spherical particles",
    "we arrive at eq .",
    "( [ forcedis ] ) .",
    "the impact theory , sketched above , was developed for the bodies with the smooth surfaces .",
    "if the surface asperities are taken into account , one can consider the actual surface as a smooth one ( obtained by averaging over the asperities heights ) , with a small perturbation superimposed due to the presence of the asperities .",
    "one can also consider the actual normal displacements and normal pressure as a sum of the averaged ( over the asperities ) values and the small perturbation .",
    "then it is easy to show that the equations , obtained for the averaged values coincide ( due to linearity of the problem ) with the corresponding equations for the elastic collision of the smooth bodies . as a result",
    ", the relation between the force and deformation , @xmath42 is the same as in the hertz s theory , provided that @xmath42 is defined with a use of the averaged over the asperities radii of the colliders .",
    "considering the normal motion for the dissipative collisions , one need not to consider the plastic deformation of the asperities , since the size of the asperities is assumed to be very small compared with the radii of the spheres . for our calculations in fig .  2 .",
    "the asperity size is @xmath202 to @xmath203 times smaller than the effective radius of the particles .",
    "hence the dissipation in the bulk of the asperities is negligibly small compared to the total dissipation in the compressed part of the collider .",
    "moreover , the ratio of the normal to tangential stress , may be roughly estimated as , @xmath204 , so that the crushing of the asperities does not seem to be important for the normal motion , if @xmath205 and if the conditions of the quasistatic collision hold .",
    "thus one concludes , that the surface asperities may be ignored , when the normal motion is studied , provided they are small and the conditions of the quasistatic collision are satisfied .",
    "to analyze more rigorously the conditions when the quasistatic approximation is valid we write the equation of motion for the viscoelastic continuum @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the density of the material .",
    "the expression for the elastic part of the stress tensor is given by eq .",
    "( [ stresstensor ] ) . taking into account the memory effects of the dissipative processes in the material",
    "one can write for the dissipative part      where the ( dimensionless ) functions @xmath209 and @xmath210 are relaxation ( or `` memory '' ) functions for the distortion strain and the dilatation , respectively .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ dismem ] ) coincides with the corresponding expression for the viscous stress tensor in  @xcite for @xmath211 .",
    "the latter approximation means that one neglects the bulk dissipation due to the dilatation rate . for the normal motion of colliding particles , however , the dissipation of energy due to the dilatation rate and the dissipation due to the distortion strain rate are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus we keep both relaxation functions in our considerations . introducing transversal and longitudinal velocities of sound in the material            to estimate the relative importance of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ viscgeneral ] ) we introduce the characteristic velocity @xmath215 and the characteristic time @xmath216 , where @xmath69 is the duration of the collision , introduced above in eq .",
    "( [ duration ] ) .",
    "then the characteristic length is @xmath217 .",
    "( [ viscgeneral ] ) can be written in a dimensionless form        we use the following representation of the convolution @xmath220 with @xmath221 being a dimensionless time from the interval @xmath222 .",
    "the relation for the convolution ( [ convolution ] ) is valid if @xmath223 .    during the collision process",
    "@xmath224 is of the order of @xmath225 , i.e. @xmath226 is of the order of @xmath227 , while by the definition of @xmath228 these values are of the order of the relaxation times for the dissipative processes in the material .",
    "that means , that @xmath228 characterizes the time when the memory effects are important . if the duration of the collision is much greater than the relaxation times , i.e. if @xmath229 , one can write @xmath230 and consequently @xmath231 if the characteristic velocity @xmath232 is much less then the speed of sound in the material too , one can neglect the terms with vanishing factors @xmath233 and @xmath234 in eq .",
    "( [ viscgen1 ] ) and finally one arrives at the static eq .",
    "( [ static ] ) .",
    "that means the quasistatic approach is valid provided that the conditions      hold . from the above considerations",
    "follows that in the quasistatic approximation the memory effects in the dissipative processes are not important and the viscous part of the stress tensor may be written in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ stresstensor ] ) , with the viscous constants @xmath116 and @xmath236 given by @xmath237    it is worth to note that the quasistatic approximation is valid for many of the granular gases one encounters in nature , since usually the characteristic velocity in these systems is low .",
    "one should also note that the description of the collision in the quasistatic approximation is rigorous in a sense that no other additional approximations are used .    as it follows from the above considerations , it is not correct to use the time dependent relaxation functions for the dissipative part of the stress tensor together with hertz s quasistatic relations  @xcite , since this approach is not self  consistent and one has to assume a lot of additional hardly controllable approximations .      also at the james franck institute , the university of chicago , 5640 south ellis avenue , chicago , illinois 60637 .",
