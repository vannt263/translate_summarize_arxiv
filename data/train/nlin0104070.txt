    "the integrability aspects of generic asymptotic lattices were the subject of studies of nieszporski @xcite and doliwa @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the paper of doliwa , the theory of asymptotic lattices and their transformations was considered as a part of the theory of quadrilateral lattices ( the discrete analogues of conjugate nets ) ; for information about the quadrilateral lattices , their transformations and reductions see @xcite .",
    "more recently nieszporski , doliwa and santini introduced the integrable discrete analogue of the bianchi surfaces @xcite .",
    "also the integrable discrete analogue of the isothermally - asymptotic nets ( fubini - ragazzi nets ) , which includes the discrete affine spheres as a particular integrable subreduction , was introduced by nieszporski in @xcite .    in this paper",

    ". therefore they can be coined * integrable lattices*.      the asymptotic lattice is defined like in the continuous case and , roughly speaking , it is a two dimensional lattice such that osculating planes of the parametric curves coincide in the intersection point ( see figure [ fig : d - as2 ] ) .",

    "let @xmath56 be a transform of @xmath41 under the discrete moutard transformation ( we consider here the upper - sign transformation only ) .",
    "define @xmath79 , @xmath80 as coefficients of the decomposition of @xmath81 in the basis @xmath82 @xmath83 after substitution of the above expression into the discrete moutard transformation we obtain that the coefficients @xmath79 satisfy six equations , which can be splitted into two parts : the following linear system for @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 and the remaining equations @xmath87 the new normal @xmath56 satisfies the primed analogue of equations and , and the primed functions are related to the non - primed ones via @xmath88 in which @xmath89 the jonas formulation gives an alternative way to construct transformations of asymptotic lattices .",
