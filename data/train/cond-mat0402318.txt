    "interface instabilities in driven non - equilibrium systems are well - known from macroscopic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "examples include the classic rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite of a heavy liquid on top of another lighter liquid , the mullins - sekerka fingering instability @xcite in diffusive systems and the saffmann - taylor instability @xcite for compressed liquids of different viscosities .",
    "however , what is much less clear is the microscopic origin of these instabilities , i.e.  a view which resolves the microscopic discrete particle trajectories causing the instability .",
    "recently there has been progress in simulating large systems with 10000 - 10000000 of discrete particles forming an interface @xcite . in particular , the microscopic origin of the rayleigh - taylor instability was explored in huge molecular dynamics @xcite and direct numerical @xcite computer simulations .",
    "a natural question concerns the applicability of coarse - grained hydrodynamics towards microscopic spatial dimensions .",
    "the basic quantities entering in hydrodynamics auch as the viscosity or the surface tension are quantities which are only defined for large systems and exhibit finite - size corrections when applied to small inhomogeneities .",
    "another approach to interfacial instabilities is via mesoscopic colloidal suspensions which bear the fascinating possibility to study the particle trajectories in real - space by video microscopy in quasi - two - dimensional suspensions @xcite .",
    "well - characterized colloidal suspensions serve as model systems for many questions of many - body systems @xcite including interfaces @xcite .",
    "the strength of an external field is easily tunable for colloids in striking contrast to molecular liquids .",
    "the dynamics of the mesoscopic colloidal particles which are embedded in a microscopic solvent is brownian rather than newtonian @xcite such that dynamical quantities are different . to the best of our knowledge , for compressible brownian fluids nothing",
    "is known about the onset of the rayleigh - taylor instability on a length scale of interparticle distances . clearly , it will be different from molecular dynamics where heat will be generated and inertia effects can lead to turbulence @xcite .",
    "one promising investigation in the newtonian case is for a suspension of heavy granular grains where rayleigh - taylor instabilities have recently been observed by rehberg and coworkers @xcite but also in this work the individual particle trajectories were not resolved .",
    "mixtures of colloids and polymers with a real - space analysis of the colloids trajectories represent another valuable system to look at for interfacial instabilities in external driving fields @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study , by brownian dynamics computer simulations , the particle - resolved onset of the rayleigh - taylor instability . in our model ,",
    "an interface separating an @xmath0-rich from an @xmath0-poor fluid is exposed to an external field which acts differently on the different particles and is directed perpendicular to the interface . in order to keep the model simple @xcite and to link to two - dimensional colloidal suspensions",
    ", we take two spatial dimensions and a symmetric equimolar mixture interacting via a yukawa pair potential .",
    "most of our characteristics , however , will carry over to three - dimensional systems , to asymmetric mixtures , and to different interparticle interactions .",
    "the external field is so large that it will induce local density inhomogeneities such that the fluid is compressible in contrast to the ordinary case treated within the navier - stokes equations @xcite .",
    "we observe two different scenarios which occur either for high or for low interfacial free energies as compared to a typical thermal energy per average particle distance . in the first scenario for high interfacial tension",
    ", an interfacial instability is observed which is driven by the competition of the cost in interfacial tension versus gain in potential energy , similar in spirit to the classical rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the classical threshold value for the wavelength of unstable interface perturbations is confirmed provided the line tension is dynamically rescaled in terms of the actual local density at the interface .",
    "the critical wavelength separating stable from unstable density undulations increases with time .",
    "this can be interpreted as a `` self - healing effect '' of the interface caused by a local density increase near the interface . in the second scenario for small interfacial tensions , on the other hand ,",
    "the particle penetrate easily the interface by the driving field and form microscopic lanes similar to previous simulation studies @xcite . in this case",
    "the classical threshold for the unstable wavelength is smaller than a molecular correlation length such that a breakdown of macroscale hydrodynamics is expected .",
    "our results are of relevance for phase - separating colloidal mixtures in a gravitational or electric field where similar effects have recently been reported by aarts and coworkers @xcite and for settling granular grains @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we define the model used and describe briefly our simulation technique . as a prerequisite , a microscopic calculation of the density profile and the line tension is presented in section [ equilibrium ] .",
    "we further review the classical rayleigh - taylor instability briefly in section [ classic ] .",
    "results for the interface instability for high line tensions are presented in section [ hightension ] , while the case of small line tensions is described in section [ lowtension ] .",
    "conclusion are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss a possible verification of our predictions in experiments .",
    "in our model @xcite , we consider a symmetric binary colloidal mixture comprising @xmath4 brownian colloidal particles in @xmath5 spatial dimensions .",
    "the particles are in an area @xmath6 with a fixed total number density of @xmath7 .",
    "half of them are particles of type @xmath0 , the other half is of type @xmath1 with partial number density @xmath8 .",
    "the colloidal suspension is held at fixed temperature @xmath9 via the bath of microscopic solvent particles .",
    "the colloidal particles of species @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are interacting via an effective yukawa pair potential @xmath13}{r } , \\label{interaction}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the center - to - center separation , @xmath15 is the thermal energy , @xmath16 is a dimensionless amplitude , @xmath17 is the particle diameter as a length scale and @xmath18 is the inverse screening length .",
    "the set of diameters @xmath19 is taken as @xmath20 @xmath21 we chose @xmath22 corresponding to positive non - additivity .",
    "this implies that the cross - interaction @xmath23 is more repulsive than @xmath24 , which drives phase separation into an @xmath0-rich and a @xmath1-rich phase .",
    "the dynamics of the colloidal particles is overdamped brownian motion .",
    "the friction constant @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 denoting the shear viscosity of the solvent ) is assumed to be the same for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles .",
    "the constant external force for the @xmath27th particle of species @xmath10 , @xmath28 , is acting differently on the both constituents of the binary mixture .",
    "it is @xmath29 for @xmath0 particles and @xmath30 for @xmath1 particles .",
    "the stochastic langevin equations for the colloidal trajectories @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) read as @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 , and @xmath11 is the complementary index to @xmath10 ( @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 if @xmath40 ) .",
    "the right - hand - side includes all forces acting onto the colloidal particles , namely the force resulting from inter - particle interactions , the external constant force , and the random forces @xmath41 describing the collisions of the solvent molecules with the @xmath27th colloidal particle .",
    "the latter are gaussian random numbers with zero mean , @xmath42 , and variance @xmath43 the subscripts @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the two cartesian components . in the absence of an external field and for @xmath46 , the model reduces to a two - dimensional brownian yukawa fluid in equilibrium which has been extensively investigated as far as structural and dynamical equilibrium correlations and freezing transitions are concerned @xcite . for a positive @xmath47 and vanishing external drive , our system will lead to equilibrium fluid - fluid phase separation including a critical point which has been studied in non - additive hard - core models by theory and simulation , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we solve the langevin equations of motion by brownian dynamics simulations ( bd ) @xcite using a finite time - step @xmath48 and the technique of ermak @xcite .",
    "the typical size of the time - step was @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a suitable brownian timescale .",
    "as a reference , the field - free case @xmath51 is studied extensively first .",
    "this is an equilibrium situation . in the simulation set - up here",
    ", we put @xmath52 @xmath0 and @xmath53 @xmath1 particles into a rectangular cell of lengths @xmath54 in @xmath55-direction and @xmath56 in @xmath57-direction with @xmath58 such that the total colloidal number density is @xmath59 .",
    "then the system spontaneously exhibits a fluid - fluid interface along the @xmath55-direction separating an @xmath0-rich from a @xmath1-rich fluid provided the density is larger than the critical density . to have an single interface system , without disturbing effects due to external walls , periodic boundary conditions are used in the @xmath55-direction while antiperiodic boundary conditions are used in @xmath57-direction . with antiperiodic boundary conditions , the particle type is changed from @xmath0 to @xmath1 if an @xmath0 particle is crossing a boundary in @xmath57-direction and vice versa . in a finite slab around this boundary ,",
    "all interactions are set to be equal , i.e. the cross interaction is @xmath60 .",
    "this avoids a second interface and minimizes finite - size effects .",
    "similar boundary condition shave been employed to study interfaces of symmetric polymer mixtures by mller , binder and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we equillibrated @xmath61 time steps corresponds to an equilibration time of @xmath62 and gathered statistics again for a further simulation time of @xmath62 .",
    "we also checked that our data do not suffer from finite size effects by choosing a larger system with @xmath63 @xmath0 and @xmath64 @xmath1 particles with @xmath65 .",
    "the antiperiodic boundary conditions force the interface to be parallel to the @xmath55-axis .",
    "all our investigations in nonequilibrium are with this larger system size .    with an equilibrated interface as a starting configuration we suddenly turn on the external field which drives the particles against the interface . an interface instability was observed .",
    "300 different equilibrated starting configuration were then typically used in order to perform time - dependent averages . for our nonequilibrium simulations , the antiperiodic boundary conditions in @xmath57 direction",
    "has no consequences once the particles are driven against the interface .",
    "in equilibrium , a phase - separated binary fluid mixture is characterized by its @xmath57-dependent partial density profiles @xmath66 and @xmath67 as defined via @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denotes a canonical average .",
    "furthermore the associated fluid - fluid interfacial free energy @xmath71 is a key quantity . since",
    "our model is two - dimensional , this interfacial free energy @xmath71 corresponds to a line tension . in a symmetric binary mixture ,",
    "the partial density profiles and the line tension @xmath71 depend on the temperature and the total number density @xmath72 .",
    "obviously , due to the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry of our model , the density profiles are symmetric , i.e.  @xmath73 , if the interface position is at @xmath74 .",
    "computer simulation results of the density profiles for a strong positive nonadditivity @xmath75 and various bulk densities at a fixed temperature are presented in figure 1 . for high densities",
    "one clearly idenfifies a depletion zone in the interface as generated by the large non - additivity . for densities closer to the critical one , however , the density profiles are getting flatter and particles interpenetrate mutually . for large bulk densities ,",
    "a slight density oscillation shows up as typical for fluid interfaces when the fisher - widom line is exceeded @xcite .",
    "clearly , for the parameters chosen , the mixture is almost completely phase - separated , i.e.  the partial densities of the a particles is practically zero in the b - region and vice - versa .",
    "again this is different very close to the critical point .",
    "we have also calculated the equilibrium line tension as a function of density for fixed temperature by using  exact \" computer simulation techniques . the interfacial free energy can be gained by integration of the anisotropy of the pressure tensor @xcite . in two spatial dimensions",
    ", this expression reads @xmath76\\,dz \\label{linetension}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the diagonal components of the local pressure tensor .",
    "this local pressure tensor has the following form @xcite @xmath79    where the subscripts @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the two cartesian components ,",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the @xmath57-dependence of the anisotropy of the pressure tensor is plotted in figure 1 as well .",
    "as can be deduced from figure 1 , its main weight is centered in the interface position around @xmath74 .",
    "the oscillations of the density field for high densities correlate to that of the pressure tensor .",
    "simulation results for the density - dependent line tension @xmath83 for two different nonadditivities @xmath84 and @xmath75 are presented in figure 2 .",
    "most of our calculations were for parameter combinations well away from the critical point where the line tension is mainly governed by internal energy such that the anisotropy of the pressure tensor is significant resulting in a relative small statistical error for @xmath71 , see figure 2a .",
    "some further points are also for smaller densities closer to the critical point , see figure 2b . by crudely extrapolating the data one could estimate the critical density to be at @xmath85 for @xmath84 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 as indicated by arrows in figure 2b .",
    "this extrapolation was cross - checked by mapping our yukawa system onto that of effective non - additive hard disks using the prescription of barker - henderson for the effective hard - core diameter @xcite .",
    "the critical point can then be read off from that of a non - additive symmetric hard disk binary mixture which has been studied in detail via theory and simulation by giaquinta and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we find good agreement with our extrapolation as compared to the mapping procedure .",
    "as can be further deduced from figure 2 , the line tension @xmath83 is strongly increasing with density .",
    "this is expected as a density increase means a smaller spacing between a and b particles such that the energetic non - additivity is getting more pronounced . at fixed density and temperature ,",
    "the line tension increases with @xmath47 which is clearly due to the fact that a larger nonadditivity leads to a larger energy cost of different particle species meeting at the interface .",
    "the classical rayleigh - taylor instability is obtained for a heavy incompressible liquid on top of a lighter incompressible liquid @xcite . a small harmonic interfacial undulation with a wave length @xmath88 yields a favorable decrease in potential energy but at the same time a free energy penalty due to the increasing arc length of the interface which costs line tension .",
    "if the wave length is larger than a critical one @xmath89 , however , the penalty is smaller than the gain such that an unstable mode whose amplitude grows in time is present .",
    "the critical wave length can be calculated in our two - dimensional situation as @xmath90 where @xmath71 is the line tension as introduced in the previous section . since the concept of line tension is a macroscopic one , eq.([rtlength ] )",
    "is only justified as long as @xmath2 is much larger than any microscopic distance as e.g. the mean interparticle spacing @xmath91 .",
    "this requires that the line tension has to be much larger than the driving force difference @xmath92 in the opposite limit @xmath93 it is expected that the classical concept of the rayleigh - taylor instability will break down .",
    "we shall explore this case in detail in section vi .",
    "another question concerns the applicability of the rayleigh - taylor instability criterion when @xmath2 is of a similar order than the mean interparticle spacing @xmath10 . as we shall show below",
    ", the criterion works remarkable well even if @xmath2 is close to @xmath10 .",
    "typical snapshots of our nonequilibrium computer simulations are presented in figure 3 for 4 different times and for two different densities @xmath94 and two different strengths of the driving force @xmath95 .",
    "the parameter combinations investigated and the corresponding ratios of the line tension @xmath71 and the driving force @xmath96 are summarized in table i. they are of the order 1 ( for combination a - c ) or a bit smaller ( for combination d ) such that the rayleigh - taylor instability wavelength is larger than or of the order of the mean interparticle spacing @xmath10 , see again table i for the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "we call an interface tension `` high '' if @xmath98 and `` intermediate '' if @xmath99 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of low surface tensions ( combination e ) where @xmath97 is significantly smaller than 1 which is studied in chapter vi .",
    "the system was started with an equilibrated single interface situation .",
    "the initial interface is pretty smooth but carries capillary fluctuations on it .",
    "the density depletion shown in figure 1 , manifests itself as a clear void region in the interface reminiscent of a `` forest - aisle '' which is induced by the strong energy cost when two different particle species do meet .",
    "then instantaneously the external driving forces were turned on forcing the particles to drift against each other .",
    "this first causes a local density increase close to the interface .",
    "then interface undulations are getting more pronounced deforming the flat interface .",
    "this is the most efficient channel for different particle species to reverse their height .",
    "a typical characteristic undulation wave length can be identified from the simulation snapshot which we shall quantify later . furthermore nonlinear effects such as interfacial overhangs ( `` mushrooms '' ) can be seen ( e.g.  in figure 3a for the largest time ) until the mixture penetrates through eachother and the height reversal is complete .    in order to quantify the structural signatures of the interface instability further , we consider the fourier transform of the interface position as a function of time . in detail , let @xmath100 be the interface position of a given configuration at a time @xmath101 , and @xmath102 the corresponding fourier transform .",
    "we are interested in the time dependence of the averaged power spectral density which is defined as @xmath103 where @xmath70 now denotes an ensamble average over inital equilibrated configurations which dynamically evolved after a time @xmath101 .",
    "if , at a given @xmath101 , @xmath104 possesses a sharp maximum at @xmath105 , this implies that the interface will exhibit mainly undulations with a wave length of @xmath106 .    as an aside , let us remark that an alternative way of obtaining the line tension @xmath71 is via the equilibrium capillary wave spectrum @xmath107 which behaves as @xmath108 for small wave vectors @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "we have checked that values for the line tension @xmath71 as obtained from this formula are consistent with those obtained from eq.([linetension ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to define a differential growth rate @xmath110 via @xmath111 a positive sign of @xmath110 implies that a mode of wave number @xmath109 is growing at a time @xmath101 while a negative sign means that - at a given time @xmath101 - the mode is decreasing .    in detail , the following numerical procedure was used to obtain the actual interface position @xmath112 : for a given particle configuration at time @xmath101 , we construct voronoi cells around each particle and define the interface based on the associated voronoi polygons .",
    "the polygon vertices that belong to cells of particles of both species @xmath0 and @xmath1 define a set of @xmath113 non - equidistant co - ordinates @xmath114 .",
    "now we eliminate the protuberance in the interface profile to get an functional interrelation for @xmath115 . for further analysis",
    "we interpolate @xmath114 by a cubic spline and eliminate sharp bends by using a simple low - pass filter @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this procedure results in a unique @xmath57-position @xmath112 of the interface at a given time @xmath101 .",
    "results for the differential growth rate @xmath110 are shown in figure 4 as a contour plot in the plane spanned by the time @xmath101 and the wave vector @xmath109 . as in figure 3 , data for the four different parameters combinations a - d are presented .",
    "the white * zero line * summarizes points where @xmath110 vanishes and separates two regimes with growing ( stable ) modes and damped ( unstable ) wave numbers .",
    "although this line is noisy , it can be read off from figure 4 that there is a whole band of wave numbers which are growing after an induction time of roughly @xmath119",
    ". the lower limit of unstable wave numbers is significantly larger than the inverse simulation box length , while its upper limit is always smaller than a microscopic wave number of the order of @xmath120 . between these two boundaries ,",
    "roughly at the arithmetric mean of the two limits , there is a wave number with a * maximal * growth rate . ! !",
    "the first basic observation is that for parameter combinations a - c where @xmath97 is larger than 1 the upper limit of unstable wave numbers is _ decreasing _ with time . !",
    "this has to do with our equilibrated starting configuration .",
    "when the external field is turned on , there is a sedimentation - like process towards the interface which yields a local density increase at the interface .",
    "this behaviour can directly be seen in the simulation snapshots of figure 3 .",
    "thereby the interface is getting stiffer as a fuction of time .",
    "we call this important effect _ self - healing _ of the interface , i.e. as a function of time the interface is getting less vulnerable with respect to short wavelength undulations . a possible destruction of the interface is efficiently blocked by a density accumulation .",
    "it is tempting to correlate this to an effective interface tension with a scaled density as obtained e.g.  by the maximal total density @xmath121 close to the interface .",
    "this maximal density @xmath121 is a function of time . if one plugs this time - dependent density into the expression for @xmath122 , one obtains a dynamically rescaled rayleigh - taylor expression ( 9 ) .",
    "the corresponding wave number is also shown in figure 4 , see the open circles with error bars .",
    "clearly the basic effect is encaptured by the dynamical rescaling as the classical rayleigh - taylor unstable wave number coincides well with the upper unstable limit .",
    "the agreement is in particular encouraging for parameter combinations a - c where @xmath123 .",
    "a special remark is in order for parameter combination d where @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , we estimate a microscopic wave number by @xmath124 and data for this wave vector @xmath124 are included in figure 4 as crosses . even in this case , the comparison between the upper unstable wave number and the scaled rayleigh - taylor prediction is qualitative .",
    "this implies that the classic rayleigh - taylor criterion is astonishingly robust even close to molecular spacings .    on the other hand ,",
    "the * maximal * growth rate is seen as light region for small wave vectors .",
    "this wave number is slightly decreasing with time as well .",
    "we have further compared the wave number of maximal growth by calculating the second maximum of the height - height - correlation function which is defined as @xmath125 the position of the second maximum of @xmath126 is also included as a square - line in figure 4 .",
    "it is increasing as a function of time towards larger wave numbers , i.e.  smaller wave lengths .",
    "the increase is small and confined to a small `` induction time '' of the process .",
    "we attribute this to an initial process which has to do with the fact that due to the non - homogeneous capillary wave spectrum eq.([capillar ] ) , undulations with larger wave lengths have initially a larger amplitude and have therefore more weight in @xmath126 .",
    "this gives rise to the crossover to higher wave number after an induction time which is pretty sharp for the parameter combinations a and b.    finally we note that at higher @xmath109 the growth rate is getting positive for larger times .",
    "this is due to the fact that the interface position is no longer sinoidal but starts to exhibit sharp parts close to overhangs .",
    "this is turn will generate higher fourier modes to grow and this is what is indicated by the zero - line at higher @xmath109 and larger times .",
    "we finally think that the zero - line at high @xmath109 and smaller times ( in figure 4a and 4b ) is statistical noise .",
    "furthermore , a full comparison of the differential growth rates to a hydrodynamic approach @xcite requires a dynamically scaled viscosity and is left for future studies .",
    "similar computer simulations were done as in the previous section but now in the regime where the line tension was low in the sense of the criterion of eq.([limit2 ] ) such that @xmath2 was significantly smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "simulation snapshots are shown for @xmath127 close to the estimated critical density in figure 5 . in this case , the interface is penetrable by the strongly driven particles and @xmath128 and @xmath129 , see the parameter combination e in table i.    in penetrating the interface , the particles form lanes similar to the behaviour in additive mixtures in refs .",
    "the width of the lanes is comparable to the correlation length of the mixture meaning that single worms of particles are formed @xcite . at the head of the lanes",
    "both spikes and extrusions are visible .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for even smaller densities below the critical density where the system is mixed in equilibrium .",
    "hence the rayleigh - taylor criterion would predict a submolecular unstable wave length but the actual realized instability wavelength is a molecular correlation length of the system of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the onset of the rayleigh - taylor interface instability on length scales of interparticle distances for a compressible brownian fluid mixture . depending on the equilibrium interfacial tension , either a direct transition towards lane formation or the macroscopic rayleigh - taylor instability was found .",
    "an interesting dynamical effect is the self - healing mechanism for the interface which is produced by a density accumulation of particles driven against eachother which then causes an increase of the instability wavelength as a function of time .",
    "it would be interesting to study the dynamical process of phase separation by starting from a completely mixed system under the influence of the driving forces . here",
    "one would expect a subtle interplay between phase separation kinetics which typically results in fractals and lane formation @xcite .",
    "one should further investigate more extensively the dependence on the `` sedimentation height '' , i.e.  how the data are affected by a larger initial @xmath56 in @xmath57-direction perpendicular to the interface . moreover .",
    "it would be interesting to start the simulation by impressing a prescribed wave length as an interface undulation and checke its differential growth .",
    "a third set - up for another initial configuration which is typically used for the molecular dynmics simulations @xcite would be to equilibrate first with respect to the external field with a fixed interface as induced e.g.  by a thin hard platelet separating the two fluid phases .",
    "the effects of different starting configuration on the onset of the rayleigh - taylor instability will be left for future studies .    for simplicity ,",
    "all our simulations were done in two spatial dimensions . in three dimensions",
    ", similar effects should persist .",
    "however , the characteristic wavelength has now two components parallel to the interface .",
    "the self - stabilizing effect of the interface and the two extreme limits should be similar as in two dimensions .",
    "the lane formation , for instance , has also be shown to be present in three spatial dimensions .",
    "let us finally discuss some possible experimental verifications . strongly non - additive mixtures which phase - separate into two fluid phases are found in colloid / polymer mixtures which exhibit colloid - rich and colloid - poor fluid phases for size ratio of about 0.5 or larger between the polymer and the colloid @xcite .",
    "recently a phase - separating mixture of colloids and polymers was observed in sedimentation by aarts and coworkers @xcite . in particular , it was observed that large regions of phase - separated colloid - rich and colloid - poor phases exhibit a transition towards lane formation .",
    "the characteristic wavelength is of the order of that given by the rayleigh - taylor instability eq.([rtlength ] ) @xcite .",
    "a full quantitative comparison has still to be performed .",
    "another system were such lane formation has been seen and which could be a candidate for a quantitative comparison is a xanthan - colloid mixture @xcite .",

    "<S> the onset of the rayleigh - taylor instability is studied a compressible brownian yukawa fluid mixture on the `` molecular '' length and time scales of the individual particles . as a model , a two - dimensional phase - separated symmetric binary mixture of colloidal particles of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a fluid - fluid interface separating an @xmath0-rich phase from a @xmath1-rich phase is investigated by brownian computer simulations when brought into non - equilibrium via a constant external driving field which acts differently on the different particles and perpendicular to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> two different scenarios are observed which occur either for high or for low interfacial free energies as compared to the driving force . in the first scenario for high interfacial tension , </S>",
    "<S> the critical wavelength @xmath2 of the unstable interface modes is in good agreement with the classical rayleigh - taylor formula provided dynamically rescaled values for the interfacial tension are used . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength @xmath3 increases with time representing a self - healing effect of the interface due to a local density increase near the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the rayleigh - taylor formula is confirmed even if @xmath2 is of the order of a molecular correlation length . in the second scenario for very large driving forces as compared to the interfacial line tensions , on the other hand , the particle penetrate easily the interface by the driving field and form microscopic lanes with a width different from the predictions of the classical rayleigh - taylor formula . </S>",
    "<S> the results are of relevance for phase - separating colloidal mixtures in a gravitational or electric field . </S>"
