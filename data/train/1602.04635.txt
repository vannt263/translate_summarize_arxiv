    "the observed excess of matter over antimatter in the universe remains one of the most important puzzles in physics and unknown sources of fundamental cp symmetry violation are its necessary precondition .",
    "intensive searches for new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) concentrate on two main frontiers : ( i ) high energy experiments performed at collider accelerators and ( ii ) low energy precision experiments . while the first group looks for exotic particles produced on - shell in high energy collisions , the second ones seek for tiny deviations in low energy observables which can be attributed to nonexisting in the sm exotic interactions .",
    "nuclear and neutron beta decays are prominent examples of the second group .",
    "the persistent problem connected with this duality is to establish a common language in order to compare the results and allow for combined analyzes .",
    "presently , the best solution is offered by the effective field theory ( eft ) which can be safely applied to both experimental domains as long as the scale for exotic phenomena is sufficiently higher than the energy achievable in accelerators . in a number of seminal papers @xcite the eft projection was applied to the charged current ( cc ) weak interaction including yet not observed but allowed by lorentz invariance genuine scalar and tensor contributions .",
    "the eft parametrization of measured observables in nuclear , neutron and pion decay and of the cross section for @xmath13 process at high transverse mass led to the combined limits for exotic scalar and tensor interactions showing that , presently , the constraints obtained from both approaches are on a comparable accuracy level . moreover , the eft analysis describes prospects and defines challenges for future experiments in the low- and high - energy searches for bsm physics .",
    "the above described thorough parametrization and analysis is , however , applied to the observables measured in the past and addressed in ongoing and prepared experiments . in this paper , we recall the idea of an entirely new experiment devoted to a simultaneous measurement of 11 correlation coefficients in the neutron decay where 5 of them were never attempted before @xcite .",
    "7 of these correlation coefficients are related to the transverse polarization component of the electrons emitted in the decay .",
    "the proposed alternative offers a potential sensitivity comparable or better to that of `` classical '' correlation experiments and completely different systematics . as compared to ref .",
    "@xcite new experimental options are discussed .",
    "the transverse electron polarization is reflected in the distribution of the decay products via a number of the correlation coefficients relating it to other vectors characterizing the system , the most important being the electron and antineutrino momenta @xmath15 and the neutron spin @xmath16 .",

    "in order to bridge the above @xmath14-decay formalism with high - energy physics and permit sensitivity comparison of these processes with other low - energy charged - current observables and also with measurements carried out at high energy colliders , the model - independent eft framework is employed .",

    "the imaginary parts of the scalar and tensor couplings parametrize cp - violating contributions .",
    "the natural way to study the high energy bsm physics effects that can be compared with @xmath14-decay experiments is to search for electrons and missing transverse energy ( met ) in @xmath52 channel since it has the same underlaying partonic process as in @xmath14-decay ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the cross section expressed in eft approximation is a function of the same eft parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) as seen in @xmath14-decay observables .",
    "the analysis of 20 fb@xmath54 cms collaboration data collected at 8 tev @xcite lead to @xmath55 at 90% c.l .",
    "the planned measurements at 14 tev ( 50 fb@xmath54 ) will improve these limits by a factor of two .",
    "the coefficients @xmath4 through @xmath10 relating the transverse electron polarization to @xmath20 , @xmath56 and @xmath16 have several interesting features .",
    "they vanish in the sm and reveal variable size of the fsi contributions , from very small to easily measurable in the present experiments . and , last but not least , the dependence on real and imaginary parts of the scalar and tensor couplings alternates exclusively from one correlation coefficient to another with varying linear combination coefficients .",
    "this feature allows one to deduce a complete set of constraints for @xmath27 and @xmath28 from the neutron decay alone .",
    "however , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , there appears a serious technical problem leading to suppression or even to complete loss of linear sensitivity to the exotic couplings since , instead of @xmath26 , effectively , measurements deliver @xmath57 : @xmath58\\re(\\mathfrak{s } )    + \\left[c_{\\mathrm{re}t}^x - c_{\\mathrm{re}t}^b(x_{\\mathrm{sm } } + x_{\\mathrm{fsi}})\\right]\\re(\\mathfrak{t } ) \\nonumber \\\\    & + & c_{\\mathrm{im}s}^x\\im(\\mathfrak{s } ) + c_{\\mathrm{im}t}^x\\im(\\mathfrak{t } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fortunately , the transverse electron polatization related coefficients are safe with that respect : the cancellation term is proportional to @xmath59 which even in the extreme cases of large electromagnetic contribution ( @xmath4 , @xmath6 ) does not exceed 0.07 so that the potential loss of the linear sensitivity to the real part of the scalar and tensor couplings is significantly suppressed .",
    "this feature makes the transverse electron polarization related coefficients attractive for future searches of bsm physics .",
    "the proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite experiment ( identified meanwhile with the acronym brand ) will measure 11 correlation coefficients ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the transverse electron polarization will be measured using the mott scattering from a high @xmath60 target ( e.g. pb ) similarly as in the experiment of refs .",
    "@xcite . the measurement of momenta of electrons and protons in coincidence allows to reconstruct the antineutrino momentum and accesses the terms dependent on this quantity .",
    "the analysis strategy is to reconstruct event - by - event the decay kinematics together with the decay origin and , in this way , reduce the effects due to the large size of the decay source .",
    "in particular , fixing the three - body decay kinematics by the measured electron energy and relative @xmath61 angle one realizes that the proton energy and thus the proton time - of - flight must choose between two discrete ( and known ) values .",
    "the key ideas of the originally proposed setup were : ( i ) efficient cylindrical detector geometry , ( ii ) electron tracking in a multi - wire drift chamber ( mwdc ) with both wire ends readout , ( iii ) detection of both direct and mott - scattered electrons in a plastic scintillator hodoscope , ( iv ) conversion of protons ( accelerated to 20 - 30 kev ) into bunches of electrons ejected from a thin lif layer and ( v ) acceleration and subsequent detection of ejected electrons in a multi - wire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) with both wire ends readout .",
    "such a setup is challenging for several reasons the most important being the implementation in vacuum of large area and thin window gas detectors .",
    "meanwhile , it appeared an attractive alternative option for electron tracking which , potentially , can significantly simplify the experiment .",
    "it makes use of the impressive progress in technology of silicon pixel detectors , especially in so called maps ( monolithic active pixel sensors ) @xcite .",
    "such detectors are produced in commercially available hv - cmos process and can be as thin as 25 @xmath62 m @xcite .",
    "suitably configured maps can replace clumsy mwdc / mwpc and easily operate in vacuum .",
    "their superior position resolution , high rate tolerance and very good fill factor ( active - to - total area ratio ) allows for compact geometry which will significantly relax experimental condition .",

    "it has been estimated that with @xmath63 decays per second in the fiducial volume and six month long data taking period one can achieve the anticipated sensitivity of about @xmath64 for the transverse electron polarization related correlation coefficients .",
    "this , in turn , leads to significantly tighter bounds for the exotic coupling constants . in fig .",
