    "it has been shown by cunqueiro , deus and pajares @xcite that the difference between the multiplicity associated to high @xmath0 events and unbiased multiplicity is given by the normalised variance of the unbiased multiplicity indicating thereby the self - shadowing of the high @xmath0 events .",
    "we here reproduce some of the equations of ref.@xcite for the sake of clarity . in hadron - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the inelastic unbiased cross section is defined as : @xmath1 where @xmath2t(b ) , the collision probability , is further divided into two classes viz .",
    ", a collision giving rise to high @xmath0 particle termed as events of type c with cross - section @xmath3 and rest of the events without high @xmath0 particle i.e. , non - c type events with cross - section @xmath4 .",
    "thus :    @xmath5    the final cross section for events of type c must contain at least one elementary @xmath3 in the sum  @xcite i.e. , @xmath6    @xmath7    this equation shows that c - events are self - shadowed , in the sense that their cross section depends only on their cross section in nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "this is also true for nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath8 as the probability for an elementary collision to be of type c , n(@xmath9 ) total number of events , and n@xmath10(@xmath9 ) total number of events of type c , the probability distribution for c type events with @xmath9 collisions in the limit of small @xmath11 can be written as @xcite : @xmath12 it was proposed  @xcite that if the total multiplicity p(n ) is obtained by the convolution of the elementary multiplicity distributions p(n ) , the total dispersion d is related to the dispersion d and multiplicity @xmath13 , of the distribution of elementary interaction as @xmath14 as in nucleus - nucleus collision @xmath9 is very high so neglecting iind term one gets : @xmath15 hence , normalized dispersion of the total multiplicity is approximated by the normalized dispersion of the number of elementary interactions . this argument is used to extend eq . 5 to the multiplicity distribution  @xcite i.e. , @xmath16 which can be written as : @xmath17 therefore , the difference between the average multiplicity associated with high p@xmath18 events and unbiased average multiplicity is given by the normalized variance of the unbiased multiplicity distribution if high @xmath0 events are self - shadowed .",
    "we generated one million au+au minimum bias events at @xmath19 200 gev and 100k pb+pb minimum bias events at @xmath19 11 tev using hijing event generator with default setting .",
    "the analysis was done in the range -1.0 @xmath20 y @xmath20 1.0 and @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath22 @xmath24 for different @xmath0 cuts .",
    "the centrality bins were calculated using the number of participants in a collision .",
    "we used eight equal spacing centrality bins of @xmath25 i.e. , 0 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 150 - 200 , 200 - 250 , 250 - 300 , 300 - 350 , and 350 - 400 representing , respectively , as centralities 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 for au+au collisions . in case of pb+pb collisions we also used the centrality bin corresponding to 400 @xmath20 @xmath25 @xmath26 450 , representing the 9th centrality bin .",
    "events having at least one high p@xmath18 track are termed as `` events of type c '' .",
    "we have used different high @xmath0 cuts to check the self shadowing effects in these event samples .",
    "figure 1(left ) shows the plot of normalized variance ( @xmath27/@xmath20n@xmath28 ) of unbiased multiplicity distribution versus centrality bin for au+au collisions at @xmath19 200 gev .",
    "it is observed that normalized variance decreases monotonically with increasing centrality .",
    "similar trend is observed for pb+pb collisions at @xmath19 11 tev ( fig.1 ( right ) ) .",
    "non - monotonic decrease of normalized variance with increasing centrality is not observed for both au+au and pb+pb collisions .         from eq .",
    "9 , we expect the ratio(r )    @xmath29    in fig .",
    "2(left ) , the ratio , r , is plotted versus centrality bin for au+au data for different @xmath0 cuts i.e. , @xmath0 @xmath28 2 gev / c , @xmath0 @xmath28 3 gev / c , @xmath0 @xmath28 4 gev / c and @xmath0 @xmath28 5 gev / c .",
