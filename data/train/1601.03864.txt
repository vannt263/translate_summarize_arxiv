    "one of the most important cornerstones for our understanding of critical phenomena is the concept of self - similarity and scale invariance  @xcite .",
    "these terms describe a situation in which the physical state of a system is in some sense invariant under a change of scale of the supporting geometry .",
    "scale - invariant properties are often found to be universal , i.e. they depend only on the symmetries of the system but not on the specific microscopic realization .    on a lattice ,",
    "a scale transformation can be carried out by coarse - graining the elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the best known examples is wilson s block - spin renormalization of the ising model , where several spins are grouped into blocks  @xcite . if the hamiltonian in terms of these block variables has the same form as the original one ( possibly with different parameters ) , this procedure maps the system onto itself , forming a group of renormalization transformations .",
    "the analysis of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow and the corresponding fixed points reveals essential information that characterizes the critical behavior .    in most studies ,",
    "scale invariance is used as a mathematical tool for the analysis of critical phenomena .",
    "the aim of the present study is to view scale transformations from a different perspective , namely , as part of the physical process itself .",
    "more specifically , we will consider time - dependent processes in which infinitesimal scale transformations are continuously carried out as part of the dynamics .",
    "this would correspond to a self - inflating ( or self - deflating ) supporting geometry on which the process takes place .",
    "if the process itself is scale - invariant , it would be interesting to study how it responds to the ongoing change of scale of the underlying support . as a possible motivation",
    ", such self - inflating scale - free processes may be viewed as toy models for critical phenomena taking place in an expanding universe .",
    "[ fig : rw ]    as a simple example let us consider a random walk in two dimensions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rw ] .",
    "the left side of the figure shows an ordinary random walk on a static background consisting of @xmath4 statistically independent displacements in random directions .",
    "the right side shows the same random walk with an identical sequence of steps on a self - inflating background , dilating the underlying space during each step by the factor @xmath5 .",
    "illustratively stated , this could be the random path of an ant on an inflating balloon .",
    "it is important to note that the random walk on the right side consists of exactly the same sequence of microscopic displacements as the one shown on the left side .",
    "however , early moves are significantly stretched by the ongoing dilatation , leading in total to a completely different trajectory of the random walker . obviously , a random walker on a self - inflating support moves faster away from the origin than in the static case .",
    "are the resulting distances still normally distributed ?",
    "if so , how do they grow with time ?    the purpose of this paper is to investigate these questions in detail .",
    "to this end we first discuss the phenomenological scaling properties of a self - similar stochastic process on a homogeneously inflating background . in sect .  3 , we recall how random walks can be analyzed in terms of cumulants .",
    "we then analyze a random walk on an expanding background both numerically and by analytical arguments . here , we consider two particular types of inflation , namely , exponential and power - law driven expansion .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks .",
    "consider a physical euclidean space which is expanding homogeneously and isotropically by itself .",
    "choosing one of its points as the origin , any other point at location @xmath6 will move away from the origin . more specifically ,",
    "the corresponding position vector @xmath7 will grow according to the differential equation @xmath8 where the scalar quantity @xmath9 is the ( possibly time - dependent ) expansion rate . alluding to cosmology ,",
    "this function will be referred to as the hubble parameter . for a given hubble parameter",
    ", we can define the dimensionless scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "this scale factor evolves by the differential equation @xmath11 with the solution @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{eq : scalefactor}\\ ] ] the scale factor @xmath10 tells us by which factor the length scales have been inflated with respect to a certain reference time @xmath13 . since we want to start from a non - stretched system , we set @xmath14 .",
    "let us now consider a scale - free dynamical critical phenomenon on this self - inflating space .",
    "the scaling hypothesis states that the physical state of such a system is invariant under rescaling of space and time by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a scale factor and @xmath18 is the so - called dynamical exponent .",
    "in addition , for a random walk the probability density @xmath19 has to be rescaled by @xmath20 in order to preserve normalization .",
    "has to be rescaled by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the critical exponent associated with the order parameter . ]    assuming that the random walk is still self - similar even on a self - inflating support , we expect it to be invariant under the scale transformation @xmath23 as a result , the probability distribution of the random walker should still be given by a gaussian stretched by the ongoing expansion .",
    "this could be used to accelerate the buildup of the correlation length in such a process .",
    "however , it is intuitively clear that we can not accelerate this buildup as much as we like because the expansion does not only stretch the large - scale structure but also the small - scale deviations caused by lattice effects",
    ". it could even be that the underlying geometry expands faster than the correlation length of the random walk itself , freezing its current structure on large scales .",
    "in fact , as we see below , this will depend on the expansion characteristics , i.e. , on the choice of the function @xmath10 .",
    "does a random walk on a self - inflating background still obey the central limit theorem ? to answer this question we study the _ cumulants _ of the corresponding probability densities .",
    "these quantities were first introduced by thiele ( 1889 ) and have been given the name _",
    "cumulants _ by fisher and wishart ( 1932 ) . a comprehensive account of their derivation and properties can be found in many standard textbooks on statistics , such as e.g. , kendall ( 1969 ) and can be summarized as follows :    recall that for a random variable @xmath24 with real values @xmath25 distributed according to the probability density @xmath26 the cumulants are defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the so - called _ characteristic function_. the cumulants are combinations of moments which are chosen in such a way that for a normal distribution @xmath29 all cumulants except for the mean @xmath30 and the variance @xmath31 are equal to zero .",
    "this property is unique to the normal distribution .",
    "therefore , in order to check if a certain distribution is gaussian it is sufficient to show that all cumulants @xmath32 for @xmath33 vanish identically . to this end , it is convenient to study the dimensionless cumulant ratios @xmath34 as a measure for the non - gaussianity of a distribution .",
    "the latter are especially useful in cases where the bare cumulants of a sum of random variables diverge , since they are standardized by the width of the underlying distribution .",
    "the cumulants feature some useful properties . at first",
    ", it can easily be shown from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumulants ] ) that in the case of a sum of two statistically independent random variables @xmath35 , where the corresponding characteristic functions multiply according to the convolution theorem , the cumulants simply add up , i.e. @xmath36 = \\kappa_n[x_1 ] + \\kappa_n[x_2 ] \\qquad n \\in \\mathbb{n}.\\ ] ] secondly , the @xmath37-th cumulant is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath37 , meaning that @xmath38=c^n \\kappa_n[x]\\ ] ] for all @xmath39 .",
    "both relations will be used in what follows .      as mentioned before",
    ", a random walk will be asymptotically gaussian if all higher cumulants @xmath40 ( or cumulant ratios @xmath41 ) tend to zero as the number of steps increases .",
    "let us first verify this criterion in the case of an ordinary ( non - inflating ) symmetric one - dimensional random walk @xmath42 with the initial condition @xmath43 and statistically independent random displacements @xmath44 . for simplicity let us assume that all displacement are drawn from a flat distribution between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. their probability density is given by @xmath47 with the corresponding characteristic function @xmath48 it is straight - forward to calculate the cumulants  ( [ eq : cumulants ] ) of a single random walker step , the first few non - vanishing being @xmath49 or , as a general expression @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the @xmath37-th _ bernoulli number_. in order to prove the central limit theorem , we consider the sum over @xmath52 subsequent steps of the random walker @xmath53 where the random variables @xmath54 denote the single moves .",
    "since all @xmath55 are drawn from the same distribution , the index @xmath56 can be omitted and the cumulant ratio after @xmath52 steps , @xmath57 $ ] , reads @xmath58}{\\kappa_2[y]^{n/2 } } = \\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\\kappa_n[x_j]}{\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\\kappa_2[x_j]\\right)^{n/2 } } = \\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\\kappa_n}{\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\\kappa_2\\right)^{n/2}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{n\\kappa_n}{(n\\kappa_2)^{n/2 } } = \\frac{r_n}{n^{n/2 - 1 } } = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{cl } 1 & \\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad n=2 , \\\\ 0 & \\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad n>2\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad n\\rightarrow\\infty .",

    "let us now turn to a random walk on a self - inflating background . to this end",
    "we first rewrite the dynamical equation of an ordinary random walk ( [ eq : ordinaryrw ] ) in the form @xmath62 where the @xmath63 denote the time instances when the jumps take place . in this equation",
    "the effect of self - expansion can be incorporated by simply including the term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : selfinflation ] ) , i.e. @xmath64 introducing the rescaled position @xmath65 , one can easily show that the hubble parameter drops out , leading to @xmath66 hence , the rescaled position of the random walker at time @xmath67 will be given by the sum @xmath68 of statistically independent random numbers @xmath69 weighted by a factor @xmath70 on an inflating space , where @xmath10 increases with time , this means that the weights decrease from move to move . in fact , as we saw in fig .",

    "this corresponds to a choice of @xmath89 for the hubble parameter .",
    "we calculate the sum ( [ eq : nonstandardized_sum ] ) of @xmath52 subsequent random walker steps . for convenience ,",

    "the cumulants ( [ eq : cumulants(n ) ] ) then read @xmath92 which , as @xmath93 , results in @xmath94 consequently , also the cumulant ratio @xmath95 and the central limit theorem fails in this case , indicating that on an exponentially inflating support , the random walk loses its characteristic behavior .",
    "moreover , for large @xmath88 , the above expression becomes @xmath96 which is nothing else than the uniform distribution of the first step .",
    "this is a reasonable result , since for very large @xmath88 the footprint of the initial step dominates all remaining moves .      as exponential background growth",
    "is obviously too fast to conserve the normal distribution of a random walker , we study now the behavior in the case of an algebraical expansion , i.e. the expansion is directed by a power law . according to equation  ( [ eq : scalefactor ] )",
    ", the expansion rate @xmath97 leads to a scale factor @xmath98 .",
    "hence the cumulants  ( [ eq : cumulants(n ) ] ) are given by @xmath99 using time steps of @xmath100 and setting @xmath101 . in order to determine",
    "for which choices of @xmath102 the central limit theorem is still valid , we consider the cumulant ratio ( [ eq : cumulant_ratio(n ) ] ) .",
    "it reads @xmath103 by definition , @xmath104 holds for the second cumulant ratio , whereas for @xmath33 we have to consider three different cases :    * for @xmath105 the denominator diverges faster than the numerator so that the cumulant ratios @xmath106 vanish .",
    "this can be seen if one compares both series , since for each two corresponding summands the inequality @xmath107 is fulfilled .",
    "* in the range @xmath108 the numerator converges whereas the denominator diverges , thus @xmath109 still holds . * for @xmath110 one can write + @xmath111 + where @xmath112 denotes a representation of the riemann zeta function .",
    "it is monotonously decreasing for @xmath113 with @xmath114 therefore , it is easy to see that @xmath115 for @xmath33 and @xmath110 .    summing up",
    ", we have @xmath116 for this reason , we conclude that the central limit theorem still holds if @xmath117 , but fails for stronger background growth .",
    "apparently , the expansion process prevails over the random walk in the latter case , since the underlying support expands faster than the length scale @xmath118 of the random walk itself .",
