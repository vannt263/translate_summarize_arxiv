    "the onset of thermalization in an isolated quantum system with a finite number of interacting particles is an important issue in theoretical physics in recent days @xcite .",

    "these experiments reveal that the question of how entropy is produced in a quantum system is one of the basic outstanding problems of many - body physics @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for thermalization is statistical relaxation in various observables of a system to some kind of equilibrium @xcite . in isolated dynamical quantum systems of interacting particles ,",
    "statistical relaxation is related to chaos in the energy spectra @xcite and here the inter - particle interaction plays an important role .",
    "chaos in quantum systems is in turn defined by the statistics of eigenstates . for time reversal and rotationally invariant systems these follow the predictions of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices ( goe ) ,",

    "@xcite .    the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth , put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite ) was so far only tested using models that employ a fixed basis set related to noninteracting particles .",
    "for example , calculations have been done for one - dimensional spin-@xmath1 systems with nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor coupling as well as for gapped systems of hard - core bosons @xcite .",
    "statistical relaxation was found , for large enough interaction strength , in the shannon information entropy and the number of principal components .",
    "similarly , the manifestation of classical chaos in the statistics of quantum energy levels and the confirmation of random matrix fluctuations in molecular spectra has been established in refs .",

    ", we consider the quantum many - body dynamics of ten bosons confined in a one - dimensional harmonic trap that interact with a contact interaction potential .",
    "the one - dimensional regime is achieved experimentally in optical and magnetic traps with tight transverse confinement and frozen radial degrees of freedom .",
    "quantum many - body effects are more important in reduced dimensional and interacting systems , because the competition between statistical properties and quantum fluctuations is enhanced in them .",
    "experimentally , one - dimensional harmonically trapped quantum degenerate systems have been realized ; see , for instance , ref .",
    "it is hence of fundamental both theoretical and experimental interest to understand the time - evolution of entropy and onset of statistical relaxation in the quantum many - body dynamics of the ultracold bose gas in one dimension .",
    "we consider quench dynamics , where our @xmath2-boson system is perturbed by abruptly switching on the two - body part of the hamiltonian . increasing the positive prefactor , @xmath3 , of this two - body part of the hamiltonian moves the system further and further away from integrability .",
    "we refer to @xmath3 as strength of the inter - particle interactions .",
    "the process of statistical relaxation is then studied by analyzing the evolution of the shannon entropy , occupation entropy , and the number of principal components in the time - dependent many - body basis set encompassing the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb )  @xcite ( see below ) .",

    "let us emphasize that exploring the solutions of tdse for systems of interacting particles in an external trap potential is a fundamental problem in many - body physics .",
    "a key aspect of the present study with the mctdhb approach is to enable faithful tests of the properties of thermalization processes in quantum many - body systems by employing an exact and realistic set of many - body wavefunctions as a basis for the computation of entropies and other relevant quantities .",
    "let us add that the present work is restricted to the many - body dynamics of a pure state , i.e. the temperature of the system is absolute zero .",

    "importantly , we also demonstrate that @xmath4 and @xmath6 approach the value predicted by the goe random matrix ensemble @xcite for larger values of the interaction strength .    to complement the results for the entropies @xmath4 and @xmath6 we study the time - evolution of the correlation function @xcite that quantifies the coherence and fringe visibility in interference experiments . for a shannon entropy defined with a noninteracting basis set",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the interference fringes in ballistic expansion become less visible in the case of irregular dynamics , i.e. , when the entropies become large .",
    "we investigate the relation of the correlation function to the production of many - body entropy quantitatively : we compare the time - evolution of the spatial first - order correlation function or coherence @xmath7 and the many - body information entropy @xmath4 .",
    "our results demonstrate the close relation of the loss of coherence and increase in many - body entropy .",
    "since the spatial correlation functions can be measured @xcite , this relation can be scrutinized in experiments to test statistical relaxation directly .",

    "measuring the expectation values of general many - body operators is however a difficult if not impossible task .",

    "we initialize the system in the ground - state @xmath23 of the noninteracting hamiltonian ( eq .   for @xmath24 ) . in the mctdhb method which we use to solve the tdse , eq .  , with the hamiltonian",

    "it is important to emphasize that in the ansatz [ eq .  ]",
    "both the expansion coefficients @xmath32 _ and _ the orbitals @xmath33 that build up the permanents @xmath34 are time - dependent , fully variationally optimized quantities .",
    "mctdhb has been established as the currently most efficient way to solve the time - dependent many - body problem of interacting bosons accurately and for a wide set of problems @xcite . in mctdhb(m ) , the vectors @xmath35 represent the occupations of the orbitals in a single configuration and preserve the total number of particles , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the number of single - particle functions that make up the permanents @xmath38 .",
    "the efficiency of the method comes from the variationally optimized and time - adaptive basis that makes the sampled hilbert space dynamically follow the motion of the many - body dynamics .    in the limit of @xmath39",

    ", we have to limit the size of the hilbert space in our computations . because the permanents are time - dependent , a given degree of accuracy",

    "this leads to a significant computational advantage over , for instance , exact diagonalization techniques ( see explanation below ) . to solve the tdse , eq .",
    ", for the wave function @xmath41 one needs to determine the evolution of the coefficients @xmath42 and orbitals @xmath43 in time .",
    "their equations of motion are derived by requiring the stationarity of the action functional with respect to variations of the time - dependent coefficients and the set of time - dependent orbitals .",
    "the obtained equations form a coupled set of nonlinear integro - differential equations @xcite that we solve simultaneously with the recursive mctdhb ( r - mctdhb ) package @xcite . for reference , we also give the equations of motion in appendix  [ eom ] . in order to calculate eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath18 [ eq .  ] ,",
    "one uses the so - called improved relaxation method . by propagating the mctdhb equations of motion [ eqs .   and ] in imaginary time for a given initial guess , excitations are exponentially damped and the system relaxes to the ground state .",
    "it should be noted that in the widespread time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( tdgp ) theory , the many - body wave function is given by a single permanent @xmath44 ; all particles reside in the same single - particle state ( orbital ) and there is consequently only a single coefficient .",
    "mctdhb(@xmath37 ) contains the tdgp theory as the @xmath45 special case .",
    "we stress here that mctdhb is much more accurate than exact diagonalization methods at the same dimensionality of the considered space . in exact diagonalization a time - independent basis",
    "is employed . in most cases ,",
    "it is built from the eigenstates of a one - body problem .",
    "these states are not further optimized to take into account the dynamics and correlations in the considered system which necessarily arise due to the presence of inter - particle interactions .",
    "thus the space and basis considered in exact diagonalization is _ fixed _ and _ not optimized _",
    ", especially for the treatment of dynamics .",
    "mctdhb on the other hand uses a time - adaptive many - body basis set ( see eq .  , ref .",
    "@xcite , and also appendix [ eom ] ) .",
    "its evolution follows from the time - dependent variational principle @xcite and is such that the error resulting from the truncation of many - body hilbert space _ is minimized by the basis at any given point in time_. this advantage of time - adaptivity helped to solve _ numerically exactly _ the time - dependent many - body problem even for long - range time - dependent one - body and two - body potentials , see refs .",
    "these references show in a direct comparison of mctdhb and exact diagonalization that the accuracy of mctdhb for many - body _ dynamics _ of ultracold bosons can in many cases not be reached at all by exact diagonalization methods , even when a very large configuration space is used .",
    "the hamiltonian of bosons in one dimension is given by the lieb - liniger model when the two - body interaction is assumed to be mediated by a contact potential @xcite . in the limit of @xmath46 (",
    "here @xmath47 is the particle density , @xmath48 is the inter - atomic coupling strength ) fermionization occurs .",
    "this so - called tonks - girardeau regime is characterized by a single but strongly correlated configuration  @xcite , i.e. , the expansion eq .",
    "would include only a single term . on the other extreme",
    ", the @xmath49 limit can be captured by the tdgp mean - field approximation for weakly interacting bosons , i.e. , a single uncorrelated configuration .",
    "one could hence speculate that an entropy measure related to configuration space would decrease as the system enters the tonks - girardeau regime since the eigenstates are single configurations .",
    "however , in our study we did not encounter such a behavior .",
    "this means that the dynamics in our study is far from equilibrium and adiabaticity and the tonks - girardeau states do not play much of a role .",
    "moreover , we chose interaction strengths , for which @xmath49 is not fulfilled sufficiently well ; our investigations are therefore in the crossover between the two regions @xmath49 and @xmath50 where any mean - field approach ( gross - pitaevskii @xcite or multi - orbital @xcite ) breaks down , because many different configurations are contributing . in this regime , as we will see in the following , many - body entropies and correlations become important and their features are present in the quantum dynamics .",
    "to study statistical relaxation and thermalization , we employ the measures information entropy @xmath4 and number of principal components @xmath5 defined as follows @xmath51 @xmath4 and @xmath5 measure the effective number of basis states that contribute to a given many - body state at time @xmath17 .",
    "the many - body nature of these quantities for the mctdhb basis set [ eq .  ] can be made explicit by writing a coefficient @xmath52 as an expectation value , @xmath53 obviously , all @xmath37 creation / annihilation operators contribute to the value of every coefficient .",
    "for this reason , the coefficients and their distribution can also be used to directly assess the content of many - body entropies in the the system qualitatively .    in the multi - orbital @xcite and gross - pitaevskii",
    "@xcite mean - field approaches only a single configuration and coefficient is included and consequently @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are entropies that can not be produced in mean - field theories .",
    "the information entropy and number of principal components of the mctdhb basis therefore are a quantitative measure for how well or not a given many - body state is captured by mean - field theories .",
    "large @xmath5 or @xmath4 means a state contains many configurations and can not be captured by mean - field methods .",
    "small @xmath5 or @xmath4 means that the state contains few configurations and is close to a mean - field state .",
    "besides the two measures @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we consider also the occupation entropy @xcite defined by @xmath56 .\\label{socc}\\ ] ] @xmath6 is an entropy obtained from the natural occupations , i.e. , the eigenvalues of the reduced one - body density matrix @xmath57 ( see eq .   below and ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . for the tdgp mean - field one",
    "has @xmath58 always , since there is only one natural occupation @xmath59 in this case . for multi - orbital mean - field theories ,",
    "several occupation numbers can be different from @xmath60 ; however , these occupations are time - independent , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "hence , for multi - orbital mean - field theories the occupation entropy @xmath6 remains constant , i.e. , @xmath62 . in the time - evolution of a many - body state , the proximity of the value of @xmath6 to @xmath60 is a measure of how well the state can be described by the tdgp mean - field .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuations in @xmath6 indicates how well the state could be described by a multi - orbital mean - field approach .",
    "since there are non - mean - field states with many configurations that also fulfill @xmath62 , it has to be checked if additionally @xmath63 holds in order to conclude that a state with constant occupation entropy is indeed of single - configuration ( i.e. , mean - field ) type .    for a goe of random matrices , @xmath64 and @xmath65 holds , where @xmath66 is the dimension of the random matrices .",
    "to obtain the goe estimate for the information entropy @xmath4 , we set @xmath67 equal to the number @xmath68 of time - dependent many - body states in mctdhb . for the occupation entropy ,",
    "the goe analog is obtained by setting @xmath69 for all @xmath29 in eq .  .",
    "consequently , in the case of @xmath6 , @xmath67 is set equal to the number of orbitals @xmath37 in the mctdhb treatment .",
    "we obtain @xmath70 in this case .      in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the normalized first - order correlation function @xmath71 defined as @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the diagonal part of the one - body density matrix @xmath74 given by @xmath75    the normalized spatial first order correlation function @xmath7 quantifies the degree of first order coherence .",
    "note that @xmath76 means that the visibility of interference fringes in interference experiments will be less than @xmath77 ; this case is referred to as _ loss of coherence_. @xmath78 corresponds to maximal fringe visibility of the interference pattern in interference experiments and is referred to as _",

    "the dimensionless strength @xmath81 of the inter - particle repulsion is varied in our investigation .",
    "we restrict the number of orbitals to @xmath82 , yielding a total of @xmath83 permanents .",
    "a key aspect of many - body quantum chaos is how the many - body wave function spreads across the available basis functions with an increase in the inter - particle interaction strength .",
    "as mentioned , this spreading is counteracted by the time - adaptivity of the basis set in mctdhb .    for an assessment of the presence of statistical relaxation ,",
    "it is instructive to first visualize the time - evolution of the coefficients @xmath84 directly . in figs .  1 and 2 we plot @xmath85 as a function of the index @xmath47 of the basis states @xmath86 .",

    "however , every eigenstate of the interacting problem can be represented as a pattern of coefficients that contribute significantly .",

    "2 are for a larger value of the interaction strength ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2 that there is a substantially larger amount of non - zero coefficients as compared to the smaller interaction strength @xmath96 ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "delocalized_. delocalized states can not be captured by mean - field descriptions . from figs .  1 and 2",
    "we conclude that increasing the interaction strength makes the states emerging in the time - evolution change character from localized to delocalized .    to further quantify the average number of time - dependent basis states that make up the wave function , we plot @xmath97 and @xmath5 for the small interaction strength @xmath88 in fig .  3 , and for the large interaction strength @xmath95 in fig .  4 .",
    "for @xmath96 , the inter - atomic correlations are small and large fluctuations in both @xmath5 and @xmath97 are seen ( fig .",
    "these fluctuations are around comparatively small averages ( compare figs .  3 and 4 ) .",

    "we have studied many - body entropy production , statistical relaxation and coherence of parabolically trapped interacting bosons for an interaction quench by highly accurate mctdhb computations going beyond the scope of commonly applied mean - field approaches .",
    "the full time - dependent solution of the many - body problem with mctdhb allowed us to define and compute new many - body entropy measures .",
    "we analyzed the information entropy , number of principal components , and occupation entropy of the time - dependent mctdhb basis set as a function of time .",
    "we have shown that an increase in the many - body entropy measures is linked to a loss of coherence in the dynamics ( see figs .",
    "5 - 7 ) . for larger values of the interaction strength",
    ", we find irregular dynamics and statistical relaxation despite the tendency of the time - adaptive many - body basis set of mctdhb to minimize the number of contributing expansion coefficients and therewith the entropies related to them .",
    "all the entropy measures are in mutual agreement ( see figs .",
    "3 - 6 ) .    for larger inter - particle repulsion , the expansion coefficients @xmath52 delocalize more strongly ( fig .  2 )",
    "and we observe a quick initial saturation of many - body entropies ( see figs .  5 and 6 ) possibly related to prethermalization .",
    "a saturation of the many - body entropy to the goe value follows on a longer time scale .",
    "it is important to stress here that this saturation is not as trivial as one might be tempted to assume : the basis set in mctdhb is explicitly time - dependent and it is optimized such that it minimizes the portion of significant coefficients in the expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the many - body entropy of the coefficients _ and _ the eigenvalues of the reduced one - body density matrix approach the goe values and statistical relaxation prevails .    by studying the time - dependence of the first order correlation",
    "we demonstrate a strong link between the dynamics of entropy and the dynamics of coherence .",
    "our present work exemplifies that large production in many - body entropy causes an intensified loss of coherence ( figs .  5 - 7 ) .",
    "this loss of coherence constitutes an independent signature of the existence of statistical relaxation , allowing to study it from another perspective and , most importantly , to measure it in experiments .",
    "further investigations are needed to test the eth and to assess the generality of statistical relaxation as well as its relation to chaos , also for larger portions of many - body hilbert space . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to understand if the found emergence of statistical relaxation is a many - body analog of the wave chaos in the tdgp equation reported in ref .",
