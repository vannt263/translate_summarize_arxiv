    "intense and superintense laser beam interaction with dense matter is characterized by one prominent phenomenon , that is the generation of superthermal high energy electrons and ions .",
    "it leads to the spontaneous question as to the effects that generate them in the absorption process of intense monochromatic light beams .",
    "latest when the kinetic temperature reaches @xmath7 ev in the plasma , @xmath8 ion charge , collisional absorption is ineffective and other effects of non - collisional nature have to become active in order to ensure absorption .",
    "the best known non - collisional candidate so far was resonance absorption at oblique laser incidence @xcite .",
    "it consists in the direct conversion of laser light into an electron plasma wave resonantly excited at the critical electron density where the laser frequency @xmath9 equals the plasma frequency @xmath10 .",
    "high intensity laser pulses in the intensity domain @xmath11 with good contrast ratio are so fast rising that there is no time to form a preplasma in front of an irradiated solid sample that could couple to a resonantly excited plasma wave . therefore the search begun for new collisionless absorption processes .",
    "the first successful proposal was the so - called @xmath12 heating @xcite .",
    "the authors could show by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations that at normal incidence the lorentz force induces non - resonant electron oscillations at @xmath13 normal to the target surface which lead to appreciable absorption , target heating and production of superthermal electrons at any density above critical .",
    "however , no attempt was made to explain how the observed absorption , i.e. , irreversibility , comes into play .",
    "not long after a step forward was made by brunel @xcite in understanding high - power collisionless absorption . he could show after introducing a few modifications that the resonance absorption concept could be adapted to steep highly overdense plasma profiles and significant absorption could be achieved under oblique incidence despite total absence of plasma resonance at @xmath14 ( `` not - so - resonant , resonant absorption '' @xcite ) and no possibility for a plasma wave to propagate into a shallow preplasma in front of the target . instead ,",
    "now the energy imparted to the electrons is transported into the target and deposited there .",
    "the assumptions of cold ( i ) infinitely dense plasma ( ii ) with discontinuous interface to vacuum ( iii ) brunel could formulate the laser - matter interaction dynamics in the vacuum in front of the target in terms of three ordinary differential equations . perhaps for this reason brunel s mechanism of the electrons pulled out into the vacuum and then pushed back into the field - free target interior is frequently identified with the term `` vacuum heating '' , an expression coined later for the particles forming a kind of thermal cloud at the vacuum - ion interface in pic simulations @xcite .    to be more specific ,",
    "the reason why the term heating played an ominous role in the past and partially still does presently is because , often invoked as the leading collisionless absorption mechanism , it has never been defined properly . to introduce some rating in this respect",
    "it seems that two groups of authors can be distinguished . by the concept of vacuum heating the first group addresses the electrons in front of the sharp - edged target that circulate in the vacuum and do not cross the interface during one laser cycle @xcite .",
    "identification of vacuum heating with brunel s mechanism is made by the second group @xcite to contrast with anomalous skin layer absorption @xcite . by the latter all motion",
    "is strictly confined to the target inside .",
    "sometimes vacuum heating is interpreted as a consequence of unspecified wave breaking @xcite .",
    "meanwhile it has been clarified that brunel / vacuum heating prevails distinctly on skin layer absorption and that vacuum heating in the restricted sense , i.e. , the contribution to absorption of the electrons not entering the target with the periodicity of the laser , is almost insignificant @xcite .     from brunel s nonrelativistic model@xcite ; ( b ) @xmath15 .",
    "energy @xmath16 in units of mean oscillation energy in vacuum ; energy cut off is at @xmath17.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    only recently a detailed analysis and discussion of brunels s model has been given @xcite .",
    "with a view on the means of the present paper a compact summary of the results may be of interest .",
    "the laser field component perpendicular to the target is assumed to have the structure @xmath18 .",
    "it generates electron jets of periodicity @xmath19 .",
    "all of them are ejected during the first quarter period and all , except @xmath20 , return to the target during the second half period @xmath21 . during the remaining @xmath22 period no further electron ejection is possible as a consequence of partial screening by the outer layers and driver field inversion .",
    "contrary to a common believe that all electrons in one jet are pushed back by the inverted field , only half of them , lifted in the interval @xmath23 , are in phase with the driver , the other half experience a weakened driver due to screening and fall back to the target , attracted by the immobile ions , before the laser field has changed direction .",
    "this leads quite naturally to a classification into energetic and less energetic electrons .",
    "if not specified differently , throughout the paper we define , somehow arbitrarily , those electrons as hot whose return energy exceeds the quiver energy @xmath24 of the free electron .",
    "accordingly , 34 % of the brunel electrons are hot and carry 82 % of the energy in the single jet .",
    "in contrast to pic simulations the brunel spectrum is non - maxwellian with a pronounced maximum at @xmath17 followed by a sharp cut off ( see fig.[brun ] ) .",
    "absorption @xmath25 is considerably lower than measured at intermediate of incidence @xcite but reaches unity at @xmath26 of incidence .",
    "@xmath27 and the absorbed energy scale like @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "evidently this is the price brunel pays for oversimplification .",
    "we want to stress that in brunel s model crossing of layers among each other during the laser action is excluded , except a few front layers whose contribution to absorption is negligible . in other words ,",
    "the electron flow dynamics is laminar , no wave breaking or , more appropriate in the context , no breaking of flow occurs .",
    "brunel s model offered , within limits , the first physical explanation of @xmath12 heating at @xmath13 . and yet , brunel s model does not give a direct physical feeling for the absorption process .",
    "the numerous wrong , at least inexact interpretations of it that are still around are a direct indicator ( example : `` all electrons are pushed back by the laser field '' contrasts with the true `` free fall '' of half of them ) .",
    "+ from an early one - dimensional ( 1d ) pic simulation the energy scaling @xmath30 has been extracted for the hot electrons @xcite ; it has been re-confirmed by independent simulations @xcite and apparently by experiments @xcite",
    ". however , the scaling seems to be questionable for its too strong dependence on intensity ; it contrasts with other experiments @xcite and more sophisticated analysis @xcite . in turn",
    ", corrections to the latter have been given recently on the basis of a relativistic kinematic model @xcite .",
    "analogous scaling laws have been proposed by numerous other authors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there is no convergence towards a definite scaling@xcite . in order to achieve further progress",
    "the investigation has to start from a discussion of collisionless absorption , a flow analysis of the absorbed energy into the various plasma components , a definition of the hot electron component , and completed by analytical modeling in combination with concomitant simulations .",
    "in what follows we present our considerations on the degree of understanding collisionless laser beam absorption , the process of fast electron generation and their interaction with the low electron energy component in order to arrive at more firmly validated scaling relations in forthcoming work .",
    "the analysis will enable us also to get insight into shortcomings of the existing models for intense laser - dense matter interaction .",
    "let us consider the phenomenon of collisionless absorption of high - power laser beams from a more fundamental point of view .",
    "quasi - steady state conditions poynting s theorem averaged over one laser cycle reduces to @xmath31 the energy flux density is the poynting vector @xmath32 ; it relates to the laser intensity by @xmath33 .",
    "with @xmath34 the electron density and @xmath35 the mean electron flow velocity the current density is @xmath36 .",
    "equation ( [ poynting ] ) describes all kinds of absorption , collisional , noncollisional , classical or quantized ; in the latter case the current density and the electric field @xmath37 are to be substituted by their operators acting on the corresponding state vector @xmath38 . in the intense laser field , despite the high particle densities involved , the classical picture is an excellent approximation .",
    "if the laser field evolves in time as @xmath39 the current density follows as @xmath40 and @xmath41 dephasing between driver field and current determines the degree of absorption .",
    "thus , collisionless absorption reduces to the problem of finding out which effects lead to a finite phase shift in @xmath42 . in collisional absorption it is the friction originating from the collisions between electrons and ions ,    @xmath43    @xmath44 collision frequency . at @xmath45 the collisional phase shift vanishes and any finite @xmath46",
    "can only be of dynamic origin .",
    "up to @xmath47 this dynamic origin is found in the space charge induced by @xmath48 .",
    "the space charge generates an electrostatic field that , superposed to the laser field , determines the electron motion and leads to the desired finite phase shift @xmath46 .",
    "this can be seen most immediately with a constant electric field @xmath49 .",
    "it yields per electron    @xmath50    it is interesting to note and it can be formally shown , however it is also physically evident that @xmath51 ; all work is done by the driver field , the space charge field @xmath52 is inert , it provides for the phase shift only .",
    "some authors may attribute absorption to the brunel like abrupt reduction of the laser wave amplitude in the skin layer .",
    "due to this asymmetry the energy gained by an electron in the vacuum can not be given back anymore to the wave when entering the evanescent region .",
    "however , for this picture to work an electrostatic field component is needed , too ; transverse and longitudinal components can not be isolated from each other . in the standard resonance absorption at the critical density it is the space charge field of the electron plasma wave that provides for collisionless absorption up to @xmath53 through a phase shift @xmath54 @xcite . on the fundamental level of eqs .",
    "( [ poyntaver ] ) and ( [ phaseshift ] ) collisionless absorption of superintense ultrashort laser pulses may be classified as fully understood now for @xmath55 for optical wavelengths .",
    "+ all kinds of difficulties and complications arise when the degree of absorption has to be quantified",
    ". this step can only be done by introducing appropriate models .",
    "numerous attempts into this direction have been undertaken with the intention to explain ( i ) the origin of the hot and the warm electron components , ( ii ) when and how they are created , during one laser period by direct resonant and nonresonant acceleration , or by stochastic processes over several laser cycles , and ( iii ) where is absorption localized , in vacuum or in the skin layer .",
    "correspondingly , the existing absorption models may be characterized as statistic or as dynamic .",
    "examples of the first class are vacuum heating in the restricted sense @xcite , wave breaking@xcite , skin layer absorption , e.g.@xcite , linear and nonlinear landau damping@xcite .",
    "candidates of the second class are , first of all , sharp edge absorption@xcite , longitudinal@xcite and transverse@xcite ponderomotive heating , `` zero vector potential mechanism''@xcite , relativistic kinematic model@xcite , anharmonic resonance@xcite .",
    "let our pic simulations decide on questions ( i ) - ( iii ) and to what degree statistics is involved in the dynamics induced by the laser in dense targets .",
    "+ now , after three decades of intense studies on superintense laser - matter interaction one would expect that such basic questions ( i ) - ( iii ) as labeled above should have found a final answer .",
    "the numerous models presented on performed experiments tell the opposite and show that no convergence has been reached yet .",
    "it is instructive to have a look at over 100 experimental and theoretical results on the absorption degree collected up to 2009 in @xcite , ( fig .  1 in @xcite ) , in the irradiance regime from @xmath56 ,  to @xmath57 .",
    "the absorption degrees range from 5% to 95% and yet at the constant irradiance of @xmath58 absorption between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is reported .",
    "it drastically reflects the difficulties encountered in performing unambiguous experiments with all essential parameters well defined .",
    "it is this situation that justifies still basic 1d simulations in order to learn more about which are the essential parameters defining the underlying physical processes .",

    "although the scaling of @xmath24 and @xmath147 may be oversimplified ( see @xcite for @xmath147 scaling ) it is correct in its tendency .",
    "our current explanation attributes the very pronounced reduction of absorption to the limiting effect of the electrostatic field on the oscillation amplitude of the single electron : with increasing intensity @xmath148 the electrons are pushed more and more inward by the radiation pressure .",
    "the electron oscillating in the neighborhood of the vacuum - ion interface oscillates in a narrow anharmonic potential the half width of which towards the target interior is a small fraction of the wavelength ( `` profile steepening '' ) . a similar reduction of absorption has been reported for normal incidence , with an explanation that agrees qualitatively with ours @xcite .",

    "is that of the reflected wave .",

    "as such a goal seems to be beyond reach at present the high power laser community has limited its focus on the energetic electrons . there , the generation of a maxwellian tail is one of the characteristics of high power interaction .",
    "it is also the most interesting part of the spectrum because , as seen from table  ii it contains the main part of the absorbed energy and , last but not least , it is relevant to applications for collective ion acceleration , radiation sources , medical applications , and others .",

    "is not feasible . regarding the mean energy , or the hot temperature @xmath163 , respectively , despite the frequent attempts in experiment and theory",
    "no convergence has been achieved so far at all . in the light of our foregoing analysis",

    "+ , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the frequently invoked ponderomotive scaling ( `` wilks scaling'')@xcite of @xmath164 is based on the idea that each laser cycle energetic electrons with energy average in the range of about @xmath165 are generated .",
    "subsequently this scaling has been recognized as too strong and , in first place guided by experiments @xcite , has been replaced by the milder power law @xcite @xmath166 in the intensity range @xmath167 .",
    "it is intended as to be applied to the unidirectional maxwellian electrons reaching the analyzer at time @xmath168 .",
    "the search for the right mean energy scaling is equivalent to the search for the process of absorption . in the absence of the stochastic element inherent in collisions it is important to understand whether a maxwellian tail is one of the signatures of the interaction and ,",
    "if it is , why .",
    "to arrive at a maxwellian distribution in an ensemble it is sufficient to know that , given a certain amount of particles @xmath169 containing the amount of energy @xmath170 , all possible states in the relevant phase space are equally likely and that the hamiltonian is given by the sum @xmath171 which expresses the property that the single electrons are uncorrelated .",
    "if the relevant phase space is @xmath172 , as for example in statistical thermodynamics , the resulting distribution is the maxwellian momentum distribution @xmath173 , in disagreement with fig.[gauss ] .",
    "however , as outlined in the foregoing chapters , fast electron generation is by anharmonic resonance .",
    "this has the important properties : ( i ) resonance is an attractor for all electrons above a certain oscillation energy , in contrast to harmonic resonance ; the always present crossing of trajectories is a clear indicator of it .",
    "( ii ) all @xmath169 electrons have the same chance to resonate anharmonically regardless of their phase with respect to the laser driver .",
    "this makes it very likely that the relevant phase space is the energy acquired at resonance rather than the momentum .",
    "then from ( i ) and ( ii ) follows that collisionless absorption is accompanied by a maxwellian tail of energetic electrons ( consequence of anharmonic attractor ) and the spectrum scales like @xmath174 without a degeneracy factor @xmath175 this is what we also deduce from fig.[gauss ] .     with laser intensity @xmath176 , standard pulse .",
    "stars : @xmath177 ( `` hot electrons '' ) ; diamonds : @xmath178 ( `` warm electrons '' ) .",

    "the uncertainties on the mean energy ( slope of log scale ) in pictures a ) ( 30 cycles ) and c ) ( 40 cycles ) are considerable , nevertheless we can conclude with certainty that neither wilks original ponderomotive scaling@xcite ( @xmath184 ) nor its improved version are met to some extent .",
    "they are far too weak .",
    "however , the analysis shows that the assumption @xmath185 with the constant @xmath186 not far from unity works .",
    "this means that at these relatively low intensities ( from @xmath187 to @xmath75 ) the scaling is + @xmath188 in agreement with @xcite . from @xmath189 on @xmath24",
    "is well approximated by @xmath190 . in fig.[scal2 ] we extended the search for scaling from @xmath75 up to @xmath91 the latter is already in the runaway regime of absorption .",
    "satisfactory agreement with @xcite is obtained for @xmath148 from @xmath191 to @xmath57 . beyond the change in the absorption mechanism and the stiffer coupling to the ions",
    "is noticeable in the increase of slope relative to @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on the physics of collisionless absorption of intense laser beams in dense targets in the intensity domain @xmath192 for optical wavelengths , on the variation of the spectral composition of the energetic electrons with intensity and on their scaling with the latter .",
    "most remarkable results are the brunel like spectral hot electron distribution at the relativistic threshold , the minimum of absorption at @xmath193 , the drastic reduction of the number of hot electrons in this domain and their reappearance beyond , the strong coupling with the return current beyond expectation , and a strong hot electron scaling in @xmath194 , a scaling in vague accordance with current published estimates in @xmath195 and a strong increase beyond .    on a fundamental level understanding collisionless absorption",
    "is equivalent to the search for the non - orthogonality of induced current density to the laser field .",
    "the answer is found in the interplay of the laser field with the space charge field induced by it .",
    "the idealized model of brunel works already on this basis .",
    "it is capable of explaining important effects at the relativistic intensity threshold and below , like the generation of two groups of electrons , a hot and a cold component . the non - maxwellian spectrum predicted by the model is found in our simulations at the relativistic threshold and below ; with increasing @xmath99 it is washed out .",
    "by following test orbits we are able to localize absorption at the vacuum - target interface and skin layer for all intensities below the radiation reaction limit at @xmath196 in linear polarization , in agreement with brunel for non relativistic intensities .",
    "if therefore the ominous `` vacuum heating '' is invoked as responsible for absorption this is correct if it is identified with brunel s mechanism .",
    "what it does not explain , and brunel does not either , is the underlying physics , i.e. the phase shift and , in concomitance , orbits crossing .",
    "an explanation in terms of physics has to show that ( i ) such a breaking of flow is not by accidence and ( ii ) a hot maxwellian tail in the spectrum is a natural outcome from strong drivers .",
    "anharmonic resonance is currently the best model explaining both aspects .",
    "it rules stochastic heating and `` weave breaking '' out automatically .",
    "anharmonic resonance constitutes an attractor ( fix point ) .",
    "this kind of resonance always happens in presence of a sufficiently strong driver at any laser frequency and any target density , in contrast to harmonic resonance which is bound to @xmath197 .",
    "when crossing resonance the momentum of an electron undergoes a phase shift by @xmath198 or a fraction of it with respect to the bulk of the plasma .",
    "wave breaking , here more appropriately called breaking of flow owing to profile steepening on lengths of a small fraction of a laser wavelength , is a consequence of absorption and energetic electron generation , not its origin .    from @xmath199 anharmonic resonance",
    "is strengthened by the generation of runaway electrons due to trapping in both , the incident and the reflected laser wave .",
    "the reduction up to nearly disappearance of hot electrons @xmath117 is attributed to oscillation inhibition by the ponderomotive space charge field . in the whole intensity domain considered the major fraction of laser energy is deposited in the hot and moderately hot electrons .",
    "the next significant portion goes into cherenkov plasmons excited by the periodic plasma jets . from the analysis of the test trajectories their coupling to the neutralizing return current is apparent .",
    "we consider it as an important aspect when modeling anomalous transport of heat and fast electrons in compressed matter .",
    "finally , we reexamined the hot electron scaling in 1d , perhaps the most controversially discussed subject in the pertinent literature .",
    "acceptable coincidence with the leading approximations is only found in the intensity range @xmath200 .",
    "the deviations below @xmath201 are to be attributed mainly to the imprecise proportionality between @xmath24 and @xmath202 . in the runaway absorption regime",
    "the governing scaling law is still to be discovered .",
    "the main reason for the current misunderstandings and disagreements have to be attributed to the poor knowledge of the electron energy spectrum @xmath70 .",
    "what is missing most at present in the experiment and in the theory is a clear definition of what means `` hot '' and `` cold '' electrons . in order not to fall into this deficiency",
    "we define electrons as `` hot '' and `` moderately hot '' if their energy is higher than @xmath24 and @xmath203 .",
    "it is approximately the range of the maxwellian tail .",
    "the commonly used terminology `` maxwellian '' is misleading because it refers to the electron velocities @xmath35 or momenta with a distribution law @xmath204 .",

    "<S> among the various attempts to understand collisionless absorption of intense and superintense ultrashort laser pulses a whole variety of models and hypotheses has been invented to describe the laser beam target interaction . in terms of basic physics collisionless absorption is understood now as the interplay of the oscillating laser field with the space charge field produced by it in the plasma . a first approach to this idea </S>",
    "<S> is realized in brunel s model the essence of which consists in the formation of an oscillating charge cloud in the in front of the target , therefore frequently addressed by the vague term `` vacuum heating '' . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of statistical ensembles of orbits shows that the absorption process is localized at the ion - vacuum interface and in the skin layer : single electrons enter into resonance with the laser field thereby undergoing a phase shift which causes orbit crossing and braking of brunel s laminar flow . this anharmonic resonance acts like an attractor for the electrons and leads to the formation of a maxwellian tail in the electron energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> most remarkable results of our investigations are the brunel like spectral hot electron distribution at the relativistic threshold , the minimum of absorption at @xmath0 in the plasma target with the electron density of @xmath1@xmath2m@xmath3 the drastic reduction of the number of hot electrons in this domain and their reappearance in the highly relativistic domain , and strong coupling , beyond expectation , of the fast electron jets with the return current through cherenkov emission of plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> the hot electron energy scaling shows a strong dependence on intensity in the moderately relativistic domain @xmath4 , a scaling in vague accordance with current published estimates in the range @xmath5 , and again a distinct power increase beyond @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy electrons penetrate normally to the target surface , the energetic electrons propagate in laser beam direction . </S>"
