    "it is widely accepted that super - massive black holes ( smbh ) in the nuclei of galaxies grew over cosmological times mainly by accreting matter from their surroundings ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "decades of wide and deep surveys at different wavelengths have endowed us with a robust view of this growth process by constraining the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) over most of the age of the universe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , the results of these population - based ( ` snapshot ' ) surveys do not provide any information on the behaviour of accreting black holes on timescales smaller than those over which galaxies evolve ( @xmath5 billions of years ) .",
    "this is due to our uncertain knowledge of the fuelling mechanisms of agn : for every galaxy of given properties , we still do not know whether black hole growth is rare and long - lived , or frequent and short - lived .",
    "in fact , understanding how black holes get their fuel at rates sufficient to power the observed agn population , despite the huge angular momentum barriers present , is a long - standing goal in the field of galaxy dynamics ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "as summarized in the recent review by @xcite , the current consensus is that gas inflow from kpc scales down to the central @xmath5100pc region occurs in all gas - rich galaxies , with the main driving mechanisms being a variety of externally - excited ( mergers , fly - by ) or internally - triggered ( secular ) gravitational instabilities , which help to shed a large fraction of the angular momentum of the gas . on the other hand , on scales of order 110pc ( i.e. close to , or within , the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black hole ) , these large - scale instabilities are less and less effective .",
    "therefore , other dynamical mechanisms must be invoked , such as dynamical friction , tidal disruption of clouds or star clusters , bars - within - bars , self - gravitating discs , eccentric discs or singled - armed spiral modes , driven by the complex , time - varying potential of the black hole , stars and gas @xcite .",
    "such complexity defies any simple modelization , as is apparent in the implementations of black hole growth within theoretical models of structure formation .",
    "there , lacking enough spatial resolution to model _ ab initio _ gas and stellar dynamics within galaxies , a number of different mechanisms have been postulated as primary drivers of nuclear accretion , often with equally satisfactory results ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent treatments ) .",
    "some observational attempts to infer recurrence times and durations of agn accretion episodes have been made from indirect ( typically space - resolved ) tracers of past activity .",
    "a classic example is the light echo of sgra * that is apparently revealed by refection from the inner molecular zone of our own galaxy @xcite . still within the galaxy",
    ", excess h@xmath4 emission along the magellanic stream has been claimed to be the result of illumination from sgra * about @xmath6 years ago , when the black hole was active at a level of 0.030.3 times its eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "arguments for powerful past agn events in nearby galaxies have been based on studies of extended emission - line regions , which can be used to trace the history of agn emission over timescales of the order of the light travel time from the nucleus to the gas ( typically @xmath3-@xmath7 years , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radio galaxies offer alternative routes into agn variability , via the analysis of the morphology of the large - scale radio emission .",
    "various pieces of indirect evidence of intermittency have been presented , such as the ripples and shock waves detected in the x - ray emitting atmosphere around virgoa / m87 @xcite , or the number versus size counts of small radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , the decrease in the optical depth for ly@xmath4 photons due to intervening absorbers along lines of sight to high redshift quasars ( the so - called  proximity effect  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can also be used to set constraints on the duration of individual qso episodes .",
    "yet another complicating factor is that at least some part of the fuel supply for agn must come from stars , which abound within galactic nuclei , and will be tidally disrupted when dislodged into orbits passing close enough to the central black hole @xcite .",
    "the frequency of such events depends on the stellar dynamical properties of galactic nuclei , and is a non - trivial outcome of a series of complex processes @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is substantial uncertainty in the true rate of tidal stellar disruption in galactic nuclei . on the one hand ,",
    "recent theoretical models , which account for realistic stellar dynamical models in galactic nuclei of different sizes and masses , have converged towards rates as high as @xmath8 yr@xmath9 , with just a weak dependence on the black hole ( or host galaxy ) mass @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "observational studies have mostly reported constraints on the tde rate that are up to one order of magnitude lower ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this apparent contradiction should not be surprising , as , observationally , the field is still in its infancy ; only around two dozen tde candidates have been identified so far by means of x - ray @xcite , uv @xcite and optical @xcite observations ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent overview ) . in particular , the full extent of the various selection effects that may plague tde selection in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum",
    "have yet to be properly characterized .",
    "nevertheless , the rate of discovery is increasing dramatically with the advent of large wide - area optical time - domain surveys ( mostly driven by supernovae searches ) , such as the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and optical ( skymapper , @xcite , ztf , and lsst , @xcite ) surveys .    in this work , we focus on just one particular example : a @xmath1 galaxy within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ` stripe-82 ' area degree survey field that lies along the celestial equator within the southern galactic cap , which has been imaged multiple times by the sdss camera ] which has undergone a dramatic and rapid change in its nuclear emission , from type-1 ( broad line ) agn - like , to type-1.9 ( showing only a weak broad h@xmath4 emission line ) within a 10 year interval .",
    "@xcite , who first reported this serendipitous discovery , rightly point out that such a dramatic change is rare @xcite , and can provide important clues on the nature of black hole fuelling in galactic nuclei .",
    "here we perform an in - depth analysis of the available ( mostly public ) data on this source ( section  [ sec : data ] and [ sec : bol_lc ] ) , and we argue , based on the outcome of our analysis , that its overall light - curve in the last decades is consistent with the tidal disruption of a main - sequence star ( with mass @xmath10 ) by a @xmath11 black hole hosted in the nucleus of a massive , star - forming galaxy ( section  [ sec : tde ] ) .",
    "our conclusions are mainly based on the properties of the optical light - curve , and the overall energetics of the event .",
    "however , the full picture reveals the complexity of this galactic nucleus , as we demonstrate that ( i ) the material giving rise to the broad emission lines illuminated by the observed flare can not be a distant part of the stellar debris ( section  [ sec : blr ] ) , and ( ii ) the narrow emission lines could indicate that about @xmath3 years ago the central black hole was active at a level similar to that observed ( section  [ sec : nlr ] ) .",
    "this prompted us , in section  [ sec : rates ] , to develop a simple unified model for agn fuelling , in order to estimate the relative occurrence of gaseous accretion and tidal disruption flares in nearby galactic nuclei .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "more interestingly , we find that also all available data - points before 1998 are consistent with the optical emission of the source being dominated by its host galaxy , albeit with larger uncertainties due to the poorer sensitivity and calibration of photographic plates .",

    "uncertainties on those fluxes , however , are such that it is not possible to exclude that sdss  j0159 + 0033 was in a state of ( low - level ) agn activity even before the flare began .    in summary , the only period during the last @xmath530 years when sdss  j0159 + 0033 was significantly brighter than its late - time ( post-2005 ) constant level ( both in x - rays and optical bands ) was during the period between 1998 and 2005 , suggesting a one - off , high amplitude , flaring episode , rather than a more typical agn variability pattern , often modelled as red - noise or `` damped random walk '' ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "the normalization of this component corresponds to a total mass of formed stars of @xmath36 , which , taking into account stellar mass loss , would imply a stellar mass of the host galaxy of about @xmath37 .",

    ", we added a power - law continuum to represent any residual nuclear emission , which is required to fit the blue end of the observed spectrum .",
    "however , the slope of such a component is barely constrained by the boss 2010 spectrum , and so we decided to fix it to that expected for the ` canonical ' viscous accretion disc @xcite @xmath38 , where @xmath39 . changing the slope of the power - law component within the range observed from the flare emission during the outburst (",

    "for the  region in the boss 2010 spectrum ( see top left plot in fig .",

    "the narrow lines observed in the boss 2010 spectrum can be used to investigate the source of ionizing radiation that excited them .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] the bpt @xcite diagnostic diagram for our measurements of the narrow emission lines ( ,  and ) as well as those derived from the analysis of the three spectra presented by @xcite ( the 2000 sdss and 2010 boss spectra , as well as a later palomar dbsp spectrum taken in 2014 ) .",
