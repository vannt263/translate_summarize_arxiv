    "there has been considerable interest in the chemical composition studies of stars in various stages of evolution , as they provide diagnostic tools to examine the predictions made by theories of stellar evolution .",
    "of particular interest among evolved stars are the post - agb stars , where the abundance peculiarities resulting from evolutionary processes manifest on a relatively short time scale .",
    "a fairly large number of post - agb stars have been studied in the last two decades . within them",
    ", a few distinct subgroups have been identified .",
    "one group containing stars with c / o @xmath0 1 displays considerable enhancement of s - process elements .",
    "typical examples are hd 56126 , hd 187785 and iras06530 - 0213 ( see reddy et al . 2002 ; and van winckel 2003 for an overview ) .",
    "these objects show two peaks in their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and their metallicity ranges between [ fe / h]=@xmath10.3 and @xmath11.0 .",
    "the o - rich post - agb stars ( c / o @xmath2 1 ) do not display s - process enhancement but display a double humped sed and metallicity range similar to that seen in c - rich agb stars .",
    "the typical examples are 89 her , hd 161796 , hd 133656 , sao 239853 etc .",
    "yet another group of post - agb stars with c / o @xmath3 1 show abundance peculiarities caused by selective removal of condensable elements e.g. bd@xmath439@xmath54926 , hr 4049 , hd 44179 , hd 46703 , hd 52961 ( references to the individual objects can be found in a review paper by van winckel 2003 ) .",
    "although a large fraction of them are known to be binaries and the presence of ir fluxes lend further support to the idea of circumbinary disk as the site of dust - gas separation , lack of detected ir for bd@xmath439@xmath54926 is difficult to explain via a binary hypothesis . many rv tau stars like ad aql , ac her , ep lyr , ar pup , uy cma , hp lyr , dy ori , bz sct , ru cen and sx cen ( see giridhar et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2005 ; maas et al . 2002 and references therein ) also show very similar abundance patterns . although ac her , v vul , ru cen and sx cen are rv tauri stars with a detected binary companion , the frequency of binaries in rv tauri stars is yet to be determined .",
    "a fourth group contains hot post - agb stars which are metal - poor with remarkably high carbon deficiency ( mccausland et al .",
    "1992 , conlon et al .",
    "1991 , moehler & heber 1998 , mooney et al .",
    "these stars also show considerable deficiency of n , o , mg and si although these deficiencies are not as large as seen for carbon .",
    "examples of this group are pg 1323 - 086 , ls iv @xmath6 and lb 3139 .",
    "these objects are believed to be evolving on low mass post - agb evolutionary tracks .    within post - agb stars ,",
    "those evolving from relatively massive main sequence stars ( @xmath7 ) would have a shorter transition time before becoming ( planetary nebulae ) pne and would be surrounded by dense circumstellar shells .",
    "the very stringent criteria of low gravity , high galactic latitude , strong ir excess and photometric variabilities given in trams et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and their location in the iras two color diagram of van der veen & habing ( 1988 ) has been extremely useful in detecting the new c and o - rich post - agb stars described above . however , there are interesting stars like bd@xmath439@xmath54926 with no ir detection and other hot post - agb stars that do not exhibit large ir excess .",
    "it is likely that these stars have evolved from the low - mass end of post - agb domain ( 1.5 to 3m@xmath8 ) .",
    "these stars would have longer transition times and would have lost most of their circumstellar envelope before moving towards the pne region . with a longer transition period , their detection probability would be higher .    our sample ,",
    "therefore , contains high galactic latitude , low gravity stars without insistence on excess ir .",
    "although hd 10132 , hd 25291 and hd 27381 do have larger than stellar fluxes at 100@xmath9 wavelengths , in most cases the excess ir is smaller than the measurement errors . similarly for hd 12533 and hd 159251",
    "the observed sed indicates that the observed ir fluxes do not translate into ir excess larger than the measurement errors . a few high velocity and high galactic latitude supergiants like hd 10285 , hd 137569 and hd 172324 without ir detection",
    "are also included but these are known to show light variabilities . in a previous paper ( arellano ferro , giridhar & mathias 2001 ; paper i ) we have presented our detailed abundance analysis for the interesting post - agb stars hd 158616 and hd 172481 . in the same paper , we had reported metal and carbon deficiency for hd 172324 and suggested that a more comprehensive analysis was required . with extended spectral coverage",
    "we have now made a more complete analysis of this object .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ obs ] the observations and reduction techniques are briefly described and a discussion of photometric estimates of the initial values of the effective temperature and the uncertainties in the derived abundances is given .",
    "section [ specana ] contains the detailed discussion on the elemental abundances of each object in the sample .",
    "section [ conclusions ] summarizes our findings and derived conclusions .",
    "table 1 contains the list of stars studied in this work , their spectral types , magnitudes , galactic positions and , if available , the iras infrared fluxes .    the observational material for this work was obtained during october 5 - october 10 , 2000 with the 1.93 m telescope of the haute - provence observatory ( ohp ) , which is equipped with the high resolution ( 42000 ) echelle spectrograph elodie .",

    "we have therefore followed the standard procedure of estimating @xmath19 by requiring that the derived abundances are independent of line strengths .",

    "for the stars with 4500  k @xmath53 8000  k we could find clean unblended lines for a large number of elements and we believe that the measured equivalent widths have an accuracy of 5 - 8% .",

    "the last column of table 3 shows the errors corresponding to an 8% error in equivalent width measurements .",
    "it is representative of the basic precision that can be attained with the instrumental setup .",
    "we find that at @xmath54 of 5000  k , a change in temperature of 250  k causes the change in line strength which is larger than the measurement errors of line strengths .",
    "these changes have been presented as changes in abundances caused by @xmath55 @xmath17 in column 6 of table 3 .",
    "similarly , columns 7 and 8 are indicative of sensitivities of line strengths to changes in log @xmath18 by 0.5 and @xmath19 by 0.5  km  s@xmath56 .",
    "the spectra of hd 10132 , hd 12533 and hd 159251 had clean unblended lines for all representative atoms covering a good range in equivalent widths , excitation potential and two stages of ionizations for many elements ( sc , ti , v , cr , fe ) .",
    "hence for these three stars the atmospheric parameters can be measured with accuracies indicated in table 3 .",
    "hd 25291 , hd 10285 and hd 27381 have temperatures in 7000  k to 7500  k range . for these stars ,",
    "the spectra are much cleaner , but not as scanty as to prevent us from getting the required range in line strengths , excitation potentials and two stages of ionisation .",
    "we have used neutral and ionised lines of mg , si , cr and fe to derive the gravities . for these stars",
    "the temperatures are not large enough for the lines to develop strong wings making line strengths inaccurate . at the temperature of 7500  k , we find that the line strengths change by a larger amount if the temperature is changed by 250  k. these changes ( presented as changes in abundances ) are much larger than the measurement errors of the line strengths and therefore are easily discernible .",
    "we are limited by the coarseness of the grid of model atmospheres .",
    "a change of log @xmath18 by 0.5 causes changes in line strengths that are twice the error of line strength measurements and hence is easily discernible .",
    "we have used additional temperature and gravity constraints such as the strengths and profiles of h@xmath57 and h@xmath58 to further improve the accuracy of these parameters .",
    "we have shown in figure 1 the loci of temperatures and gravities derived using different criteria .",
    "the adopted value of temperature and gravity is indicated by the asterisk .",
    "the gravities are estimated with an accuracy of @xmath59 dex through profile fitting of h@xmath57 and h@xmath58 lines . at 7500  k , as one",
    "can see from table 3 , the calculated abundances are less sensitive to the changes in microturbulent velocities and hence our estimate of @xmath19 may have an uncertainty of 1 - 2 km  s@xmath56 .",
    "the errors in @xmath23 values vary from element to element .",
    "for fe i lines , experimental values of accuracies better than 5% do exist , for other fe - peak elements the range in errors could be within 10 to 20% .",
    "for heavier elements , particularly for @xmath60-process elements , the errors could be larger than 25% .",
    "hence for fe - peak elements with a large number of lines measured and good @xmath23 estimates available , abundances can be estimated with an accuracy of 0.15 to 0.2  dex .",
    "for the elements where fewer lines are available , like s - process elements , the uncertainty could be @xmath610.3  dex or more .",
    "we therefore believe that our abundance estimates for stars hd 10132 , hd 12533 , hd 159251 , hd 10285 , hd 25291 and hd 27381 have accuracies within 0.2   and 0.4  dex depending upon the number of lines measured and the quality of the @xmath23 values available .",
    "for stars hotter than 10000  k the lines are fewer and have shallower profiles with extended wings .",
    "hence the line strengths can not be measured as accurately .",
    "we have therefore estimated the errors in the calculated abundances caused by the errors of equivalent measurements using 16% as the typical accuracy of line strength measurements .",
    "since the spectrum synthesis code moog was primarily written for late type stars and does not incorporate the opacities necessary for the flux computation of hot stars , we chose to use the spectrum code which is described in gray & corbally ( 1994 ) for the analysis of hot stars hd 137569 and hd 172324 .",
    "we were concerned about the systematic differences that might be caused by the use of these two different codes .",
    "we have therefore computed the spectrum of vega using a stellar model with @xmath17 of 9400  k , log @xmath18 of 3.9 and @xmath19 of 2.0  km  s@xmath56 and the recent abundance estimates from the literature .",
    "the spectra computed using moog and spectrum codes were compared with the high resolution spectrum of vega ( qiu et al .",
    "1999a , b ) in selected spectral regions containing important lines for many elements of interest .",
    "we found very satisfactory agreement for all elements with the the abundances derived using the two codes up to temperature of 8000k .",
    "hence we believe there is no systematic difference in estimated abundances caused by the use of two different codes .",
    "however at temperatures hotter than 10000  k the departure from lte becomes important .",
    "we have applied the systematic corrections caused by the neglect of non - lte and they are discussed in the subsection of each star .",
    "these effects and the relative paucity of lines of representative atoms results in larger measurement errors for the abundances for hd 172324 and hd 137569 .",

    "our interest in this object has been aroused by its significantly large radial velocity ( @xmath63 km  s@xmath56 ) .",
    "as can be seen from table 4 our analysis covers a large number of elements based on a large number of lines for many elements . although the derived iron deficiency [ fe / h ] @xmath64 is not very large , it is a high precision estimate .",
    "the star also shows noticeable relative enhancement of na and s relative to fe .",
    "non - lte corrections for na abundances at the temperature of 7750  k for the lines employed by us is @xmath65 as tabulated by takeda & takada - hidai ( 1994 ) .",
    "hence the na enhancement reported in table 4 is not caused by the neglect of non - lte effects but is a real effect .",
    "the enhancement of na relative to fe is possibly caused by the mixing of the nena - cycle products from the hydrogen burning region .",
    "we do not have evidence of evolution beyond the red giant stage for this star .",
    "this star has been included in a number of investigations and the estimated temperatures lie in the 6700  k ( andrievsky et al .",
    "2002 ) to 7600  k ( venn 1995a , b ) range .",
    "venn carried out a comprehensive abundance analysis covering many elements .",
    "our analysis employs an even larger number of lines and extends to heavier elements .",
    "the carbon abundance derived by us is systematically smaller than the value derived by venn ( 1995b ) but the lines used by us are different . for silicon and oxygen",
    "we find good agreement with the values obtained by venn .",
    "we find a relative enrichment of na , si and s , similar to that found in hd 10285 .",
    "the abundance of s - process elements is essentially solar .",
    "we do not consider this object as a post - agb star .",
    "although the sed generated using observed optical and ir color bands shows larger than stellar component fluxes at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath9 , the error bars are too large to report ir excess . at 100@xmath9",
    "the excess ir flux is larger than the measurement errors .",
    "we have derived carbon abundance by synthesizing the the 4765 - 4780   spectral region containing ci lines as shown in figure 2 .",
    "nitrogen abundances were derived using n  i lines in the 7420 - 7470   region . as can be seen from the abundances presented in table 4 ,",
    "this is a metal - poor star .",
    "although [ fe / h ] of @xmath66 is not very large , it is quite significant .",
    "since the derived [ fe / h ] is very similar to the mean metallicity of thick disk population ( gilmore et al .",
    "1995 ) , we chose to compare elemental abundances for this star with those derived for thick disk stars by prochaska et al .",
    "these authors give the mean [ x / fe ] for a large number of elements in their table 19 .",
    "although hd 27381 shows enhancement of some @xmath67-elements like o , si and s seen in the thick disk stars , it does not show relative enrichment of mg and ti .",
    "the observed [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] are larger than their corresponding values in prochaska et al.s ( 2000 ) sample , and relative enhancement of al is not seen , although [ ca / fe ] agrees within the errors of the estimates . on the other hand ,",
    "we find an indication of evolutionary effects in the form of enhanced n and na abundances and carbon deficiency .",
    "a non - lte correction of @xmath68 is estimated by venn(1995b ) for the c  i lines at the temperature of 7500  k , although this estimate was made for lines in 7100   region .",
    "hence the non - lte [ c / fe ] would be even smaller than the [ c / fe ] of @xmath68 given in table 4 .",
    "for n  i lines used in the present work at 7500  k the non - lte corrections are estimated as @xmath69 indicating a non - lte corrected [ n / h ] of @xmath70 and [ n / fe ] of @xmath71 .",
    "hence we have a very distinct signature of cn processed material on the surface of this object .",
    "this star resembles hd 107369 as described by van winckel ( 1997 ) in some respects .",
    "its temperature and hydrogen lines profiles are similar , both objects are metal - poor with [ fe / h ] of @xmath72 and @xmath66 for hd 107369 and hd 27381 respectively , and show a relative carbon deficiency and nitrogen enhancement .",

    "the derived deficiency of c accompanied by n enhancement indicates that the cn processed material is brought to the surface via dredge - up .",
    "the carbon deficiency found for hd 137569 is not as large as in other hot post - agb stars .",
    "a more remarkable feature is the total absence of fe  ii lines .",
    "we could only get an upper estimate of @xmath80 for [ fe / h ] .",
    "the weak si  ii and mg  ii lines also led to [ si / h ] and [ mg / h ] of @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "on the other hand the s  ii and ne  i lines indicate near solar abundance .",
    "these abundances are derived using a sufficiently large number of lines and hence are quite robust . the selective depletion of easily condensable elements with higher condensation temperatures has been observed in a large number of post - agb stars .",
    "well known examples are hr 4049 ( lambert et al .",
    "1988 ) and hd 44179 ( van winckel 1995 ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon has also been found in many rv tau stars ( giridhar et al . 2005 , maas 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the elements s and zn have a lower condensation temperature and are generally unaffected by this effect . in fact",
    "these elements are considered better metallicity indicators .",
    "however , s and zn abundances are not available for many hot post - agb stars .",
    "although this phenomenon is well studied in post - agb stars of intermediate temperatures , its presence in hot post - agb stars is not yet established .",
    "we are only aware of ls iv @xmath6 and lb 3193 showing incomplete suggestions of selective depletion of refractory elements .",
    "we have compared the abundances of hd 137569 with other hot post - agb candidates and two pne given in table 5 .",
    "we have plotted in figure 5 the observed abundances of the stars included in table 5 as a function of the most recent condensation temperatures presented by lodders ( 2003 ) .",
    "it might have been more instructive to plot the abundances of these elements relative to s or zn but these abundances are not available for many post - agb stars .",
    "the depletion of refractory elements is an attractive but yet to be substantiated possibility for stars cooler than 13000  k. efforts are required to measure sulphur abundances in hot post - agb candidates .",
    "the large depletion only of refractive elements gives strong support to the post - agb candidature of hd 137569 .",
    "the explanation of these abundance peculiarities found in post - agb stars requires a site of dust - gas separation .",
    "the suggestion of dust - gas separation occurring in a circumbinary disk is gaining more support with the increase in detected binaries among post - agb stars .",
    "hd 137569 is known to be a single lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 529.8 days and a systemic velocity of @xmath83 km  s@xmath56 as reported by bolton & thomson(1980 ) .",
    "this might strengthen our suggestion that hd 137569 is a post - agb star .",
    "lack of iras fluxes might be caused by a longer transition time .",
    "the derived temperature and gravity places the star very near the post evolutionary track of schnberner ( 1983 ) for a mass of 0.546 m@xmath8 .",
    "the c , n , o abundances of hd 137569 resemble with those for pn ls iv @xmath84 ( conlon et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the uv spectra of this object would be extremely useful for the better coverage of fe - group elements .",
