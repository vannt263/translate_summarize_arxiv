    "largely forgotten during the early decades of nanoelectronics , the spin degree of freedom is becoming ever closer to the center of the research stage @xcite .",
    "indeed , generating and detecting spin - currents is now a fascinating field of research @xcite with applications in future electronics @xcite , quantum computing @xcite and information storage @xcite . among the many ways of harnessing the electron spin , spin orbit interaction ( soi ) in two - dimensional electron gases",
    "is a promising one since the spin transport properties can be controlled simply by applying an electric field @xcite .",
    "most of the proposals aiming at the control of the spin degree of freedom use static electric or magnetic fields @xcite . here",
    "we follow a different path and use alternating fields ( ac ) as in @xcite . the time - dependence introduced by the alternating fields",
    "@xcite provide an avenue for exploring new phenomena including the opening of a laser - induced bandgap @xcite or chiral edge states @xcite and , more generally , the tuning of its topological properties @xcite .",
    "another striking phenomena is the coherent generation of a current at zero bias voltage ( termed _ quantum charge pumping _ ) @xcite and , as shown below , the generation of a pure spin - currents through spin pumping .",
    "quantum pumping is usually achieved by driving a sample connected to electrodes through ac gate voltages . within the adiabatic approximation @xcite ,",
    "pumping a non - vanishing charge requires the presence of at least two time - dependent parameters ( typically constituted by gate voltages ) and has been widely studied in many systems including pristine @xcite and disordered graphene @xcite . but beyond the adiabatic approximation _ single - parameter pumping _ is also possible as predicted theoretically @xcite ( similar to the mesoscopic photovoltaic effect predicted earlier in @xcite ) and achieved in careful experiments @xcite . besides reducing the burden of adding more contacts in a nanoscale sample , a single parameter setup could also prove advantageous ( as a compared to a two - parameter one ) in reducing capacitive effects and crosstalk between time - dependent gates .",
    "here we address the effect of spin - orbit coupling and its interplay with a single time - dependent field in the generation of non - adiabatic spin current at zero bias voltage .",
    "to such end we consider a setup as the one represented in fig.[fig1 ] , where a nanoscale ring is connected to electrodes and has a quantum dot embeded in one of its arms .",
    "the time dependence is introduced as an alternating gate applied to the quantum dot and does not break neither time - reversal nor inversion symmetry ( parity ) .",
    "crucial to the generation of pumped current is the addition of a magnetic flux threading the ring as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is introduced as an additional spin - dependent flux . in this paper",
    "we show how this simple setup is able to provide a minimal model where a pure spin - current can be achieved .",
    "let us start our discussion by presenting our model hamiltonian for the situation represented in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath0 is written as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the left and right contacts and the lower arm of the ring ( represented by site @xmath3 in the notation below ) , @xmath4 the quantum dot in the upper arm of the ring ( which for simplicity is taken to be a single level ) , and @xmath5 the tunneling hamiltonian between the quantum - ring and the contacts , which are given by @xmath6 the time dependence is introduced as a modulation of the energy levels of the quantum dot . for a single - level quantum - dot , this is is achieved through @xmath7 .",
    "we consider a magnetic and electric fields in the system , their contributions to the hamiltonian are embedded in the hopping matrix elements @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the phases due to the aharonov - bohm effect and spin - orbit interaction respectively , @xmath11 is the spin index ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is the flux quantum .",
    "since we are interested in a single - parameter pumping configuration as in @xcite , the calculation of the electrical response requires going beyond the adiabatic theory .",
    "floquet theory offers a suitable framework @xcite .",
    "here we use it in combination with green s functions , then we have a floquet - green function denoted by @xmath15 defined from the floquet s hamiltonian @xmath16 as @xcite @xmath17^{-1}$ ] .",
    "if the spin - orbit coupling does not couple different spin channels , as in our case , the dc component of the current is given by :    @xmath18d\\varepsilon,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the probability for an electron on the left ( @xmath20 ) with spin @xmath11 and energy @xmath21 to be transmitted to the right ( @xmath22 ) reservoir while exchanging @xmath23 photons and @xmath24 .",
    "these probabilities are weighted by the usual fermi - dirac distribution functions @xmath25 for each electrode and are given , in terms of floquet - green function , by @xmath26 where the probability in opposite direction is described exchanging the index @xmath20 with @xmath22 , and @xmath27 is the matrix coupling with left ( right ) electrode , defined as the imaginary part of the electrode s self energies , i. e. @xmath28 .",
    "the associated spin - current is @xmath29 while the charge current is @xmath30 .",
    "using the model introduced before we now turn to our results for the pumped electric and spin currents . to start with we consider the system in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we consider the leads in thermodynamic equilibrium ( _ i . e. _",
    "@xmath31 ) as a semi - infinite 1d system with nearest neighbor coupling @xmath32 , which is used as energy parameter .",
    "the ac field frequency is set to @xmath33 such that @xmath34 , and the field magnitude is @xmath35 .",
    "the hopping between the contacts and qd is @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows a contour plot of the transmission probability as a function of the fermi level position and the magnetic flux .",
    "there we can observe the presence of a region where the transmission is very close to zero ( close to the intersection of the dashed lines ) .",
    "this is due to a destructive quantum interference known as fano resonance or antiresonance @xcite(for a recent review @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the pumped current shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b achieves a maximum intensity whenever the parameters are tuned close to the transmission zero . besides , we can see that the sign of the observed maxima is reversed when traversing the transmission zero .",
    "we note that a single - time dependent harmonic potential does not break time reversal symmetry ( being defined as the existence of a time @xmath37 such that the hamiltonian which is a function of the time @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is the magnetic field that breaks trs and allows for pumping to occur .",
    "note , however that this is true only whenever magnetic flux is different from the half integer multiples of the flux quantum . for a magnetic flux of @xmath40 for example ,",
    "the hamiltonian does not change upon time - reversal ( the phase in the hopping term @xmath41 changes from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and therefore there is no pumped current as observed in fig .",
    "2-b . on the other hand one should note that the magnetic field alone would not produce pumping .",
    "this is the point where the time - dependent field enters into the game .",
    "its role in this setup is to provide for additional effective channels for transport , thereby circumventing the constraint of phase - rigidity @xcite and allowing for the directional asymmetry in the transmission probabilities .",
    "the addition of spin - orbit interaction breaks the spin degeneracy and at zero bias both charge _ and _ spin currents are generated . by examining fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) one can imagine that the spin - orbit phase may be used to tune the working point of our pump for each spin _ independently_. indeed , the term @xmath44 enters as an effective spin - dependent flux @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , we could choose this spin - orbit phase so that it cancels out for one spin direction ( leading to a vanishing pumped charge for this spin ) and adds up for the other , or in such a way as to cancel the charge current while summing up towards the spin current .",
    ", dashed line ) and spin currents ( @xmath46 , solid line ) , dashed and solid for different values of the applied static flux and spin - orbit interaction : ( a ) @xmath47 , @xmath48 and b ) @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "one can see that in ( b ) the charge current vanishes but the spin current is enhanced .",
    "the spin - resolved contributions to the current for the same cases are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) . ]",
    "figures [ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the charge ( solid lines ) and spin ( dashed lines ) currents as a function of the fermi energy for different values of the spin - orbit and aharanov - bohm phases , while figures [ fig3 ] ( c ) and ( d ) show the pumped current for each spin , spin up ( black solid lines ) and down ( red dashed lines ) .",
    "as anticipated , the parameters can be chosen so that the currents for each spin direction have opposite signs ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( d ) ) , thereby leading to a pure spin - current as on fig.[fig3 ] ( b ) . in this situation ,",
    "the charge current cancels out whether the spin - current is maximal .",
    "a point that needs to be emphasized in this proposal is that the pumped current is intrinsically non - adiabatic ( this contrasts for example with ref .",
    "@xcite using a similar setup but with two time - dependent parameters ) .",
    "an adiabatic calculation would actually give a vanishing response .",
    "going beyond this adiabatic ( low - frequency ) limit is therefore mandatory justifying the use of floquet theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the pumped currents in this case emerges as an interplay between photon - assisted processes and the interference in the aharanov - bohm ring @xcite .",
    "a similar setup but without contacts to electrodes were considered in @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling allows to obtain spin polarized pumped currents and the key role of the time - dependent field is to provide for additional paths for interference breaking phase - rigidity @xcite , although it does not break time - reversal symmetry .    the setup discussed here can be realized by using the present technologies .",
    "a quantum dot inserted in a mesoscopic ring has been fabricated by several laboratories in the last decades@xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting case would be an @xmath51 quantum - dot inserted in a mesoscopic quantum - ring since @xmath51 has a strong spin - orbit coupling and this coupling can be controlled by an electric field @xcite .",
    "in summary , we study quantum spin - pumping with a single parameter in a configuration where the effect of the time - dependent field is reduced to the essential one : providing for additional channels for transport .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction breaks the spin degeneracy and we exploit it to generate a pure pumping spin - current through the independent tuning of the phases dues to aharonov - bohm effect and spin - orbit coupling .",
