    "the first surprising result that we got in the study of @xmath0  cen came from the wide field photometry that we performed in 1999 at the 2.2 m eso - mpi telescope ( la silla , chile ) , equipped with the wfi ( wide field imager ) mosaic camera .",
    "figure  1 shows the @xmath1 cmds for each of the 8 wfi chips separately .",
    "the cluster is roughly centered on chip # 2 .",
    "more than 230,000 stars have been plotted : to our knowledge , this is the largest stellar sample ever observed in @xmath0  cen .",
    "the most striking feature of this cmd is the existence of a _ complex _ structure in the brighter part of the red giant branch ( rgb ) : at least two main components are visible . particularly notable",
    "is the presence of a narrow sequence ( see also lee et al .",
    "1999 ) , significantly redder and more bent than the bulk of the `` main '' rgb stars , which we call the _ anomalous _ rgb ( hereafter rgb - a ) .",
    "note that the rgb - a is visible only in the cmd from chip # 2 ( where the cluster center is located ) and to a much lesser extent in the nearby chip # 1 and possibly chip # 3 .",
    "the morphology of the rgb - a and its position in the cmd strongly suggest that it is populated by stars much more metal rich than the @xmath0  cen bulk population . in order to get a first indication about the metal content of the rgb - a stars ,",
    "we have combined our catalog with the extensive low resolution spectroscopic survey carried on by norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , based on the infrared calcium triplet indicator : figure  2 shows the metallicity distribution of the red giants in @xmath0  cen , obtained by using the distance of each star from the mean ridge line of the dominant , metal poor population as a sort of metallicity indicator ( figure  2 , panel _ ( b ) _ ) .",
    "we can thus identify three different rgb components , or sub - populations :    * _ rgb - mp : _ the dominant , metal poor population , with [ ca / h]@xmath2 , which drives the average metallicity of the whole cluster . * _ rgb - mint : _ the intermediate metallicity population , with [ ca / h]@xmath3 and a long extended tail reaching up to [ ca / h]@xmath4 . * _ rgb - a : _ the anomalous , newly discovered population , with [ ca / h]@xmath5 , which represents the extreme metallicity end of the cluster distribution , and comprises @xmath6 of the whole rgb population .",
    "thus , we have photometrically isolated a distinct sub - population , the rgb - a , whose sharp and clear - cut shape in our cmd allows us to select a representative sample of stars for high - resolution spectroscopic follow up , in order to obtain their detailed abundance pattern .",
    "the discovery of the rgb - a poses a number of questions that need to be answered , in the light of what we already know about the chemical and dynamical properties of the rgb stars in @xmath0  cen , to put this new stellar population in the context of the star formation and/or merging history of the whole cluster .    in order to completely characterize the chemical properties of the rgb - a stars",
    ", we need to obtain high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra for a sufficient number of stars .",
    "the ideal tool is uves ( uv - visual echelle spectrograph ) mounted on the vlt ( very large telescope ) at paranal , in chile . with this instrument",
    "we can obtain a resolution of @xmath745000 , comparable to the latest studies ( like smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , and we can easily and fastly achieve s / n@xmath8100150 .    our observing programme",
    "was split in two different observing runs : a pilot study on six rgb stars , that was carried out in june 2000 ( _ run a _ ) and a more extensive survey of 23 additional stars , that was successfully carried out in april  may 2001 ( _ run b _ ) .",
    "the main goals of this project are the following : _ ( a ) _ to sample adequately the whole extension of the rgb - a and _ ( b ) _ to observe a few rgb - mp and rgb - mint stars in common with previous high resolution studies , both to have a feeling for the soundness of our results and , lately , to merge all the existing databases in a homogeneous way .",
    "figure  4 shows the position of the programme stars along the rgb .    in the following sections i will briefly describe the method used and report on some preliminary results for the six stars of the pilot survey , while the complete analysis of the whole sample ( 29 stars in total ) is still under way .",
    "we selected our programme stars for _ run a _ among the metal - richest stars in @xmath0  cen ( see table  1 ) .",
    "three of them , stars roa  300 , wfi  222068 and wfi  222679 , belong to the anomalous rgb - a , while the other three belong to the intermediate metallicity population , the rgb - mint .",
    "none of the six stars has been observed before with high - resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath9 ) , except for the rgb - mint star roa  371 ( see table  2 ) , that has been studied by paltoglou & norris ( 1989 ) , brown et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , vanture et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and norris & da costa ( 1995 ) , and for this reason is the ideal comparison object .",
    "roa  371 has always been considered to be a peculiar star , showing strong baii and srii lines ( dickens & bell 1976 ) , and a mild variability ( cannon & stobie 1973 ) .",
    ".programme stars parameters .",
    "the columns contain the following information : _ ( 1 ) _ the star name from woolley ( 1966 ) or from the wfi photometry of pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; _ ( 2)-(3 ) _ magnitudes and colors from pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 )  the unpublished @xmath10 magnitude comes from the same dataset ; _ ( 4 ) _ the photometric estimate of @xmath11 obtained with the calibration by alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; _ ( 5)-(8 ) _ the stellar parameters resulting from our abundance analysis ( see text ) and _ ( 9 ) _ the sub - population to which the star belongs , according to pancino et al .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results we obtained can be directly compared with previous studies , since star roa  371 has been observed before by four different groups , with the results reported in table  2 .",
    "the stellar parameters of the different studies are in good agreement with each other , and the [ fe / h ] abundance determinations are consistent within the uncertainties .    moreover , we observed star roa  300 with low and intermediate resolution spectroscopy in the infrared wavelength range with sofi ( see the contribution by ferraro , pancino & bellazzini , this volume ) and we obtained a preliminary abundance of [ fe / h]@xmath8 - 0.9 , again in good agreement , within the uncertainties , with the value obtained from the uves spectra .",
    "the values listed in table  1 are the first direct estimate of the chemical abundance for stars belonging to the rgb - a population ever obtained using high - resolution spectroscopy . by taking a straight average for the three rgb - a stars we find : [ fe / h]=@xmath12 and [ ca / h]=@xmath13 .",
    "this result confirms the conclusion by pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the rgb - a is the extreme metal rich component of the @xmath0  cen stellar mix .",
    "it is interesting to note that the abundances obtained here are lower than previous estimates based on calcium triplet measures ( see above ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that calcium triplet calibrations are usually quite uncertain at the high metallicity end : norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) explicitly warned the reader on the fact that their metal - rich stars results are based on an _ extrapolation _ of their calibration and should thus be treated with caution .",
    "however , the most interesting result that we got from the analysis of the six spectra presented here is the different @xmath14-enhancement measured for the two sub - populations .",
    "we found [ ca / fe]=@xmath15 and [ si / fe]=@xmath15 for the three rgb - mint stars , in perfect agreement with the expected @xmath14-enhancement for globular cluster stars , and only [ ca / fe]=@xmath16 and [ si / fe]=@xmath17 for the three rgb - a stars in our sample .",
    "this is the first evidence that stars with significant low @xmath18enhancement do exist in @xmath0  cen .",
    "note that both norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who analyzed red giants in @xmath0  cen with metallicities up to [ fe / h]@xmath19 and [ fe / h]@xmath20 respectively , found _ no evidence _ of decreasing calcium ( or any other @xmath14-element ) enhancement with increasing metallicity .",
    "the effect is also illustrated in figure  5 , where their studies ( empty symbols ) are compared with our results ( filled symbols ) .",
    "figure  5 clearly shows the tendency of decreasing [ ca / fe ] and [ si / fe ] with increasing metallicity for the 6 stars presented here .",
    "the solid line marks the galactic [ @xmath14/fe ] relation as can be desumed from edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and gratton ( 1999 ) .",
    "if the result shown in figure  5 is confirmed by larger samples of metal rich stars , _ we have found the first indication that the medium from which the rgb - a stars have formed has been previously enriched by type ia supernovae ejecta_.",
    "a detailed discussion of the chemical evolution of @xmath0  cen is beyond the purpose of this contribution , however some obvious implications of the results presented above deserve a short comment . how do the new results presented here on the rgb - a population compare with the most widely accepted scenarios for the formation of @xmath0  cen",
    "?    there are two main scenarios that have been proposed to explain the variety of stellar populations observed in @xmath0  cen , both based upon non - negligible observational evidences : _ case a ) _ the most popular scenario proposes that @xmath0  cen is a complex stellar system ( possibly a dwarf galaxy , or the remnant of a formerly larger galaxy ; see freeman 1993 ) that was able to self - enrich during its star formation history ; _ case b ) _ it has also been suggested ( icke & alcaino 1988 ; norris et al .",
    "1997 ; pancino et al .",
    "2000 ) that some of the present stellar components of the cluster may have formerly belonged to an external , smaller stellar system that merged with the main body of @xmath0  cen .",
    "let s discuss the two separately .",
    "previous abundance studies on the rgb - mp and rgb - mint stars in @xmath0  cen , like the ones by norris et al ( 1995 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , show that : _",
    "( i ) _ the @xmath14 enhancement is constant ( [ @xmath14/fe]@xmath8 + 0.3 ) with metallicity , implying that part of the sne  ii ejecta have been retained by the cluster ; _ ( ii ) _ there is no evidence for a contribution from sne  ia for any of the stars studied so far ( [ fe / h]@xmath21 - 0.8 ) and _ ( iii ) _ the overabundance of @xmath22-process elements is increasing with metallicity , probably because the rich ( and presumably younger stars ) have been enriched by the slow winds of agb intermediate mass stars .    while the [ @xmath23/fe ] overabundance indicates that a major interstellar medium enrichment by type ii supernovae took place over a relative short timescale ( @xmath24 1 gyr ) , the @xmath22-process element overabundance indicates that the enrichment by agb stars took place over timescales ranging from a few hundred million and a few billion years , depending on their actual progenitor mass .",
    "moreover , the metal poor and intermediate populations show _ no sign of enrichment by type ia supernovae ejecta_. this could be explained both with a star formation process short enough to end before the onset of type ia supernovae , or , in case of longer star formation timescales , by assuming that type ia supernovae winds efficiently removed most of their own products ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "hence , if we assume that indeed the detailed chemical composition of _ all _ of the giants in @xmath0  cen can be explained by pure self - enrichment , then the evidence we presented above tells us that the most metal rich ( and thus somewhat younger ) population of @xmath0  cen has been enriched by supernovae type ia ejecta . in this scenario",
    "we have detected the `` knee '' of the [ @xmath14/fe ] relation , a very valuable constraint to the chemical evolution of the whole stellar system ( mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "the canonical interpretation of this feature in the [ @xmath14/fe ] relation is that all the stars poorer than the knee should have formed in a relatively short timescale of the order of @xmath81  gyr .",
    "however , these timescales are still uncertain , see for example matteucci & recchi ( 2001 ) for a review of the sensitivity of the snia enrichement timescale on initial mass function and star formation rate .",
    "thus , within the framework of pure self - enrichment chemical evolution , our finding would also imply some age spread ( @xmath25few gyr ) between the rgb - a population and the previous , more metal poor ones .",
    "an age spread of @xmath26 seems infact needed to explain the morphology of the sgb - to region of recent strmgren photometries like the ones by hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) or hilker & richtler ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , a clear answer to the relative ages problem can only come from high - resolution spectroscopic studies of stars in the sgb - to of @xmath0  cen , that can break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "the merging hypothesis for the formation of @xmath0  cen was put forward by icke & alcaino ( 1988 ) , to explain both the ellipticity and the metallicity spread observed .",
    "admittely , the collected observational evidence make the merger of two ordinary globular cluster in the potential well of the milky way unlikely . for istance , accordingly with smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) the merging of two or more single metallicity clusters scenario can not account for the broad distribution of the rgb",
    ". however , evidence of correlation between the metallicity and the dynamical properties ( norris et al .",
    "1997 ) or the spatial distribution ( pancino et al",
    ". 2000 ) are still difficult to explain in the pure self - enrichment scenario .",
    "thus , the possibility still exists that at least the rgb - a stellar population was originally a satellite system of @xmath0  cen . within this framework",
    "the most promising scenarios seems to be the so - called _ merger within a fragment _ ( norris et al .",
    "1997 ) , in which the rgb - a stellar population was originally a satellite gas cloud in the potential well of the larger _",
    "cen galaxy_. the results presented here add the evidence that this cloud was also previously enriched by the ejecta of type ia supernovae .",
    "the results presented here represent a first step towards the understanding of the star formation history of @xmath0  cen .",
    "a comprehensive scenario of course requires a much more extensive sample of stars , together with accurate measures of the relative ages and detailed abundance patterns of stars near the turn - off and sub giant branch regions of the cmd .",
    "we are already planning to extend our study in this direction within the framework of the global project presented by ferraro , pancino & bellazzini , in this volume .",
