    "the weiss theory of ferromagnetism is  an exactly solvable model `` that allows one to study thermodynamic functions in detail , in particular their properties near the critical temperature''@xcite .",
    "the only element which hampers the possibility of calculating analytically any thermodynamic aspect is the fact that the equation of state , which is a transcendental equation involving the magnetization , the temperature and the external magnetic field , can not be solved analytically .",
    "recently , this obstacle has been removed , as , due to work of mez , baricz @xcite and mugnaini @xcite , the equation of state was in principle solved , using generalized lambert functions .    however , these solutions are quite cumbersome and difficult to handle , at least in the context of experimental magnetism .",
    "this is why it is still important to have , besides the exact solutions , some simpler analytical approximations , more convenient in practical situations . in the last decades",
    ", several analytical approximations have been obtained for the brillouin and langevin functions or their inverses , with applications in ferromagnetism @xcite , polymers ( strong polymer deformation and flow ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or solar energy conversion ( daily clearness index ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to give new and precise examples of such analytical approximations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall expose the main elements of the weiss theory and the attempts of solving - exactly or approximately - the equation of state .",
    "the exact solutions , in terms of generalized lambert functions , are presented . in section 3",
    ", we obtain an approximate but very precise expression of the magnetization as a function of temperature , in zero magnetic field , involving elementary functions only . in section 4 ,",
    "a similar result is obtained , for the case of a non - zero external magnetic field . in section 5",
    ", the experimental relevance of these results is discussed .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the main equation of this theory is the equation of state @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath0 describing the dependence of magnetization @xmath1 on temperature @xmath2  and on external magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "also , @xmath4",
    "so , @xmath5 is the maximum value of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is the molecular field parameter , introduced by pierre weiss in 1907 , and @xmath7 is the brillouin function : @xmath8 if @xmath9 @xmath10    so , if @xmath11 and the external field is zero , @xmath12 eq .",

    "( [ 10 ] ) is sometimes called weiss equation , we shall also adopt this terminology in the present paper .",
    "it is a transcendental equation , as its solution can not be written as a finite combination of elementary functions .",
    "there are several attempts of solving , exactly or approximately , this equation .",
    "an interesting approach is due to siewert and essing @xcite ; it is based on the theory of complex functions , mainly on the theory of singular integral equations @xcite .",
    "it has been systematically applied by siewert and his co - workers in order to solve a large number of transcendental equations , involving hyperbolic ( or trigonometric ) and algebraic functions .",
    "however , the results obtained in this way are not explicit and can be hardly used in practical calculations .",
    "another approach , invented and re - invented by several authors @xcite , @xcite , puts the transcendental equation in a differential form and writes its solution as a series expansion .",
    "if we define the function @xmath21  by @xmath22 the weiss equation ( [ 10 ] ) takes the form : @xmath23 we easily find that @xmath24  can be expressed in terms of the function @xmath21  and of @xmath25 : @xmath26    as any higher order derivative of @xmath21  has the same property , we can write down the series expansion of @xmath27  near an arbitrary point @xmath28 as : @xmath29    this approach has two inconconveniences : ( 1 ) the radius of convergence of the series is quite small , and the expansion must be repeated in the neighborhood of several points @xmath28 ; ( 2 ) we have to check that the series exists in the neighborhood of @xmath28 ( this is not the case , for instance , if @xmath28 is an essential singularity of @xmath21 ) .",
    "recently , a crucial progress was achieved in solving a large class of transcendental equations , namely using generalized lambert functions @xcite , @xcite , with applications to magnetism and other branches of physics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us mention that the lambert function @xmath30 is the solution in @xmath31  of the transcendental equation : @xmath32 in other words , the lambert function is the inverse of the function appearing in the left hand side of ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "similarily , the solution in @xmath33  of the transcendental equation : @xmath34 is the generalized lambert function@xmath35    one of the beneficiaries of the progress made in the study of generalized lambert functions is the weiss equation .",
    "actually , eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) takes the form : @xmath36 whose solution can be written as @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a particular case of ( [ 17 ] ) , namely of @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , the parameters @xmath40 in @xmath39 are particular cases of the parameters @xmath41 from ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 17 ] ) and have nothing to do with any physical quantity , like temperature or spin . at its turn",
    ", @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of a simpler , but similar function , the @xmath42lambert function , @xmath43 is defined as the solution of the equation : @xmath44 and can be expressed as a series expansion in terms of mez - baricz polynomials , @xmath45 @xcite .",

    "( [ 19 ] ) provides a direct and exact solution of the weiss equation for @xmath46 and @xmath11 ( e.g. the dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of a magnetic monodomain system with @xmath11 versus temperature ) , it is quite unconvenient for practical applications .",
    "this is why a simpler analytical approximation of ( [ 19 ] ) might still be useful .",
    "an interesting approach in finding approximate analytical solutions of transcendental equations is to approximate the non - algebraic functions involved in such equations with algebraic ones . in this way",

    "for instance , eq .",
    "( 45 ) of @xcite suggests the following approximation for the exponential function : @xmath47 even if such an approximation might give useful results when applied to certain quantum mechanical problems , it is inappropriate for the weiss equation , as it can not reproduce the critical behavior of the magnetization on a large enough interval .    in the following section , we shall propose a precise approximate analytical solution of the weiss equation , inspired from the standard ways of obtaining physically convenient solutions of the schroedinger equation",
    "in order to find a convenient solution of the weiss equation ( [ 10 ] ) on the interval @xmath48 , we shall find out firstly the behavior of @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51    so , for @xmath52 @xmath53 which can be written as : @xmath54    if we put : @xmath55 eq .",

    "this mathematical aspect is unimportant for the physicist , as the correct low temperature dependence of the magnetization is not exponential , but power - like ; it obeys the well - known `` @xmath68 bloch law '' ( see also the eqs . (",

    "( [ 10 ] ) , we applied actually an approach systematically used in order to find a physically acceptable solution of the scroedinger equation .",
    "a wellknown example of such an approach might be the following : when we are solving the schroedinger equation in a coulombian field , we are looking for a solution which `` behaves well '' near origin and at the infinity .",
    "it is , in fact , similar to what we have done here , isolating the behaviour of @xmath90 near @xmath67 and @xmath91    the plot of the reduced magnetization @xmath49 given by eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) is given in fig .",
    "1 .        if @xmath49 satifies ( with a good approximation ) the equation : @xmath92 it will satisfy ( with an equally good approximation ) the equation : @xmath93    the function @xmath94 with @xmath49given by eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) and the function @xmath95 are plotted in fig .",
    "2 , for comparison .",
    "it is easy to see that the approximation of @xmath96 by @xmath97  is excellent .",
    "the largest relative deviation , less than @xmath98 , corresponds to a region of little physical interest , being far away from the critical point of the transition temperature , where the superposition with experimental values should be the most relevant .    in applications to experimental physics involving temperatures of hundread of kelvins , the exponential factor in the expression of magnetization plays no role and instead of ( [ 34 ] ) we can look for a solution of the weiss equation ( [ 10 ] ) of the form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a polynomial ( of the same degree as @xmath101 ) .    applying the same approach , outlined after eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) , we get the following expression for @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104    the precision of this simpler expression is still higher then the previous one : the error is less than @xmath105 for @xmath106    even more interesting is the fact that this approach can be applied to any brillouin function @xmath7 defined in ( [ 3 ] ) , not only for @xmath107 for an arbitrary @xmath108 the weiss equation in zero magnetic field is given by the formula : @xmath109 and the reduced magnetization can be approximated by : @xmath110    for instance @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 with a maximum relative deviation smaller than @xmath119 also for @xmath120 for larger values of @xmath25 , the approximation is much better .",
    "the results of @xcite can be easily used in order to obtain an explicit solution of the more general equation of state ( [ 8 ] ) , written in reduced parameters . actually , according to @xcite ,",
    "this explicit solution is : @xmath121    for reasons explained in the previous section , this solution is quite inconvenient for practical purposes .",
    "the main goal of the present section is to obtain an alternative expression for @xmath122 , using simpler functions - actually , a series expansion in powers of @xmath123 , whose coefficients are known , being expressed as elementary functions of @xmath124    with : @xmath125 the equation of state ( [ 8 ] ) becomes : @xmath126    a closed form of @xmath127 was obtained in the previous section , eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) , so an accurate analytic approximation of the function @xmath128 is known , at least down to enough low @xmath25 . differentiating ( [ 52 ] ) with respect to @xmath129 and putting @xmath130 we get : @xmath131 and : @xmath132 consequently : @xmath133    so , the value of the previous expression is known , as the function @xmath128 is known , e.g. via @xmath134 provided by ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "this property of the derivative remains valid in any order ; consequently , we can write @xmath135 in this way , we obtain a series expansion for @xmath122 , according to ( [ 51 ] ) , valid for small values of @xmath136 it should have in mind , however , that we did not investigate the convergence of this series .",
    "from the experimental point of view , a direct expression of the magnetization versus temperature and field might be of high interest for getting material dependent parameters of ferromagnetic materials ( magnetic moment and spontaneous magnetization , curie temperature , molecular field constant and exchange integral , etc . ) through a suitable fitting of the experimental data .",
    "it is worth to mention that case of ferrimagnetic ( or even no completely compensated antiferomagnets , e.g. due to structural / interfacial / surfacial defects ) can be treated in a similar manner by a simple association of a finite magnetic moment to a formula unit .",
    "some real ( and very often defect ) magnetic systems could present an enough high magnetic disorder temperature , in order to be completely analyzed within the temperature range of sensitive magnetometers ( e.g. squids ) .",
    "mainly these are the cases where a complete estimation of the material parameters can become effective by fitting the experimental data obtained over a narrower range of field and temperature via the above discussed theoretical expressions .",
    "a proof of concept on how this procedure can be experimentally implemented for magnetization measurements versus temperature will be provided for one of the above analyzed cases , corresponding to a solid state system with @xmath11 ( a quenching of the orbital magnetic moment is assumed ) . to note that the local magnetic moment of the magnetic entity ( atom , molecule , formula unit ) can be verified from the saturation magnetization at very low temperatures which also approaches the spontaneous magnetization @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the experimental function @xmath137 can be obtained if @xmath138 and @xmath139 are known .",
    "the first two are experimental parameters , whereas the last one can be obtained via specific magnetization measurements versus temperature , e.g. as the temperature where the spontaneous magnetization drops to zero . very often , such measurements have to be done at temperatures much higher than the room temperature , involving therefore additional higher temperature options for usual magnetometers . instead , the curie temperature can be obtained by fitting the experimental dependence @xmath140 , as collected under a low enough applied magnetic field , over a much reduced range of temperatures . the aforementioned general relation ( [ 51 ] ) , written under the form @xmath141 should be used in this respect .",
    "however , in order to achieve this task , a series of experimental conditions should be fulfilled . as a first condition , the system might respect the overall brillouin dependence of magnetization versus temperature , that is , size or anisotropy related magnetization relaxation phenomena ( e.g. superparamagnetic behavior ) should be avoided .",
    "a second condition is related to the removal of magnetic domains in the system , condition which might be fulfilled by measuring the magnetization versus temperature under convenient constant applied magnetic fields . in the case of quite soft magnetic materials",
    "the measurements can be done in low enough magnetic fields ( e.g. of magnetic induction as low as @xmath142 ) , in order to keep only the term proportional to @xmath123 in relation ( [ 51 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the following experimental steps are proposed .",
    "the @xmath143 curve at the lowest temperature ( e.g. @xmath144 ) should be initially obtained for estimating the saturation field and the saturation magnetization @xmath5 .",
    "then , the dependence @xmath140 can be obtained under an applied field higher than the saturation field and up to the maximum temperature of the device ( e.g. 400k for a squid ) . according to figs .",
    "1 and 2 , the most reliable values for @xmath145 might be obtained if the maximum experimental temperature will overpass at least @xmath146 from @xmath145 .",
    "that is , for a maximum measuring temperature of @xmath147 , a curie temperature of about @xmath148 may be determined with acceptable accuracy .",
    "the procedure of determining the transition temperature is the following .",
    "the experimental ratio @xmath149 will be represented versus @xmath150 for a set of @xmath145 values ( e.g. @xmath151@xmath152 ) . in this way ,",
    "the experimental representations of @xmath137 versus t will be obtained for different values of @xmath145 .",
    "the theoretical representations of @xmath137 via the relation @xmath153 with @xmath154 given by eq .",
    "( [ 51 ] ) will be obtained for the same set of @xmath145 values . in a first approximation , @xmath139 is estimated as that temperature value in the considered set corresponding to the best superposition between the experimental and the theoretical @xmath137 curves .",
    "the procedure can be repeated for a new set of @xmath145 values ( with a better temperature discretization , e.g. of @xmath155 ) around the first approximation until the desired precision of @xmath145 is obtained .",
    "it is also to mention that actually there are experimental techniques providing parameters proportional to the spontaneous magnetization . among them ,",
    "the local techniques of @xmath156 mossbauer spectroscopy is extremely powerful in following the temperature variation of the @xmath157 magnetic moment on each @xmath157 phase ( the hyperfine magnetic field , @xmath158 as specific parameter is proportional in certain circumstances to the magnitude of the @xmath157 magnetic moment and hence with the spontaneous magnetization attributed to that @xmath157 phase ) .",
    "being a local techniques seeing directly the magnitude of the magnetic moment , it does not involve any applied magnetic field and therefore , the simplest equation ( [ 51 ] ) can be used as reflecting the experimental temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath159",
    "a proof of concept for direct series - expansion solutions of the weiss equation of ferromagnetism is provided .",
    "even the concept is exemplified in case of non - zero magnetic field for a magnetic system with @xmath11 , it works in principle also for systems with enhanced @xmath160 values , with the mention that in that case the brillouin function will replace the @xmath161 function , with direct implications on its derivatives . also the spontaneous magnetization and curie temperataure will depend specifically on @xmath160 , which might become an additional fitting parameter in the final expression of magnetization .",
    "the general solution of the reduced magnetization in applied field is always expressed as function of the temperature dependent solution of the spontaneous magnetization in the absence of the applied field .",
    "specific procedures to use the developed expressions in case of magnetization or mossbauer spectroscopy measurements are also mentioned .",
