    "the critical current density @xmath1 of a type ii superconductor usually decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "however , in weakly pinned superconductors , the interplay between the intervortex interaction and the flux pinning produces an anomalous peak in @xmath1 before it decreases to zero at the superconductor - normal phase boundary ( @xmath4 line ) @xcite .",
    "this effect is known as the peak effect ( pe ) and it signifies that the vortex phase undergoes a transition from an ordered phase to a disordered phase @xcite .",
    "the pe in weakly pinned superconductors is accompanied by metastable vortex states .",
    "each metastable vortex configuration is characterized by a different @xmath1 , which depends on the thermomagnetic history of the superconductor .",
    "bean s critical state model ( csm ) , which is usually used to describe the hysteritic magnetic response of the superconductors assumes a unique value of @xmath1 , independent of the thermomagnetic history @xcite .",
    "therefore , it fails to account for the magnetic properties of superconductors in the pe region .",
    "recently , ravikumar et al proposed a model to explain the history dependence of the critical current density @xcite .",
    "this model postulates a stable state of vortex lattice with a critical current density @xmath5 determined uniquely by the field and temperature , independent of the past magnetic history .",
    "this stable state can be reached from any metastable vortex state by cycling the applied field by small amplitude .",
    "we report here the results of an investigation of the stable state in the pe region in a single crystal sample of ceru@xmath0 .",
    "ravikumar _ et al _ have proposed a model for the history dependence of the critical current density @xcite .",
    "an important assumption of this model is the existence of a stable vortex state with a critical current density @xmath5 which is unique for a given temperature and field .",
    "they postulated the following equation to describe how the vortex state evolves from one configuration to other : @xmath6 @xmath7 is a macroscopic measure of the metastability and describes how strongly @xmath1 is history dependent .",
    "physically , we may imagine that in the absence of thermal fluctuations , it is the change in local field @xmath8 that can move the vortices from their metastable configuration to a nearby stable state . it can be seen from the above equation that a metastable vortex state with @xmath9 can be driven into the stable state by cycling the field by small amplitude .",
    "dc magnetization measurements have been carried out using a 12  tesla vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) [ oxford instruments , u.k . ] on a single crystal sample of ceru@xmath0 ( @xmath10 6.2  k ) .",
    "the sample was vibrated with an amplitude of 1.5 mm and a frequency of 55 hz .",
    "the dc field was swept at rate of 0.02 tesla / min . , while recording the magnetization hysteresis loops at 4.5  k. all the measurements were carried out by cooling the sample to 4.5  k and then applying the magnetic field ( zfc mode ) .",
    "1 shows the hysteresis loop , constituting @xmath11 curve in the increasing ( forward ) and decreasing ( reverse ) field cycles ( envelope curve ) .",
    "according to bean s critical state model , this hysteresis in magnetization @xmath12 provides a measure of the critical current density ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , an anomalous increase in the width of the hysteresis loop is a distinct indicator of the occurrence of the pe .",
    "we identify @xmath14 as the onset field of the pe on the forward leg , where @xmath15 begins to decrease sharply .",
    "the onset field for the pe on the reverse leg is marked as @xmath16 which is less than @xmath14 .",
    "the field where the magnetization hysteresis bubble is the widest identifies the peak field @xmath17 and the collapse of the hysteresis loop locates the irreversibility field @xmath18 , above which the critical current density falls below the measurable limit of the method used .",
    "[ mhl ] also shows the minor hysteresis loops ( mhl ) starting from both forward and reverse legs recorded at different fields within the pe region . as per csm",
    ", all the mhls are expected to lie within the envelope curve and saturate by reaching the envelope curve .",
    "however , it can be seen from the fig .",
    "[ mhl ] that the mhl starting from a point @xmath19 on the forward cycle saturate without meeting the reverse curve although they remain well within the envelope curve . on the other hand ,",
    "mhls starting from a point @xmath20 on the reverse curve overshoot the forward curve .",
    "these observations can not be understood within the csm and indicate that @xmath1 is magnetic history dependent over some part of the pe region .",
    "moreover , they also imply that the critical current density in the forward cycle ( @xmath21 ) is less than the critical current density in the reverse cycle ( @xmath22 ) . using the saturation points of the mhls ,",
    "magnetization hysteresis loops corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be generated .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 can be obtained from the width of the hysteresis loops .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ jc ] )    in fig .",
    "[ cycling ] , we show the mhls obtained by repeatedly cycling the field starting from 2 points ( @xmath20 ) on the reverse cycle . the cycling amplitude @xmath23 is chosen such that it is above the threshold field required to reverse the direction of shielding currents throughout the sample . from the fig .",
    "[ cycling ] , it is clear that the mhls show shrinkage with field cycling and after few field cycles , the mhls retrace each other indicating that @xmath1 does not change further with field cycling .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the vortex state is in a stable configuration . on the forward cycle ,",
    "the mhls ( @xmath24 ) show expansion with field cycling and finally the mhls retrace each other indicating the stable vortex state .",
    "fig  .[magn ] shows the stable magnetization hysteresis loop obtained from the stable mhls .",
    "the critical current density in the stable state ( @xmath5 ) can be obtained from the width of the stable state hysteresis loop .",
    "[ jc ] shows the critical current density in the forward and reverse cycles and in the stable state .",
    "it can be seen that they follow the relation : @xmath25 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied different metastable vortex configurations in the pe region of the weakly pinned ceru@xmath0 .",
    "these states have been characterized by different values of critical current densities , which were obtained by magnetization measurements . as an important part",
