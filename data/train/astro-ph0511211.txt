    "hydrodynamic instabilities of shocked accretion flows may explain quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) processes occurring in black hole candidates .",
    "the structure of stationary black hole accretion flows involving standing shocks was first described by fukue ( 1987 ) .",
    "subsequently , shock studies have been made extensively in both inviscid and viscous accretion flows ( chakrabarti & das 2004 ; gu & lu 2004 and references therein ) . however , even with the simple inviscid hypothesis , the stability of the shock is not fully understood . in the isothermal limit , nakayama ( 1992 ) introduced a global instability between a sonic point and a shock , and found the criterion that  post - shock acceleration causes instability \" , which was confirmed by the simulations of nobuta & hanawa ( 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , nakayama ( 1994 ) investigated this instability in an adiabatic flow and claimed that such a criterion is also correct unless the shock is extremely strong .",
    "all the above works , however , were only for axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the pioneering work of papaloizou & pringle ( 1984 ) found a non - axisymmetric instability based on the acoustic cycle between the corotation radius and the boundary .",
    "the papaloizou - pringle instability ( hereafter ppi ) is known to take place in discs or tori , in which the radial velocity is initially zero .",
    "the mechanism of such an instability has been discussed extensively by goldreich & narayan ( 1985 ) , goldreich , goodman & narayan ( 1986 ) , narayan , goldreich & goodman ( 1987 ) and kato ( 1987 ) .",
    "the effect of radial advection on the ppi was investigated by blaes ( 1987 ) , who found that the ppi is strongly stabilized by advection at the inner boundary .",
    "another type of non - axisymmetric instability was found in a spherical accretion flow by foglizzo & tagger ( 2000 ) and foglizzo ( 2001 , 2002 ) , which is based on the cycle of entropy / vorticity perturbations and acoustic waves in the subsonic region between a stationary shock and a sonic surface .",
    "recently , gu & foglizzo ( 2003 , hereafter paper i ) studied a shocked accretion disc in the isothermal limit and found that the shock is generally linearly unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations despite the post - shock deceleration .",
    "paper i pointed out that such an instability is a form of ppi modified by advection and the presence of the shock .",
    "apart from the above linear works , molteni , tth & kuznetsov ( 1999 , hereafter mtk ) performed 2-d simulations of a shocked adiabatic flow and found a non - axisymmetric instability .",
    "mtk simulations showed that the instability saturates at a low level , and a new asymmetric configuration develops , with a deformed shock rotating steadily .",
    "the mechanism of the instability , however , was not explained in mtk .",
    "they briefly mentioned a possible link with the non - axisymmetric disc instabilities studied by blaes & hawley ( 1988 ) .    in this paper , we investigate the stability of a shocked accretion flow in the adiabatic and inviscid limit .",
    "we compare our linear results with the non - linear simulation results of mtk and manage to explain the different behaviours in their simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a set of linearized equations and boundary conditions .",
    "subsequently , in section 3 , we present the linear results by numerically solving the equations .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we summarize our conclusions and present a discussion .",
    "an adiabatic flow around a black hole is considered in the pseudo - newtonian potential introduced by paczyski and wiita ( 1980 ) , @xmath0 .",
    "equations are made dimensionless by using the schwarzschild radius and the speed of light as reference units , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this paper ,",
    "the thickness of the flow is approximated as a constant for the sake of simplicity , as in nakayama ( 1994 ) , blaes ( 1987 ) , mtk and paper i.    the stationary flow is described by the conservation of mass and the bernoulli equation : & & r = const .  , [ mass ] + & & e = + + - = const .  , [ bernoulli ] where @xmath3 is the density",
    ", @xmath4 is the radial velocity , @xmath5 is the sound speed , @xmath6 is the specific angular momentum , and @xmath7 is the bernoulli constant . the structure of a stationary flow involving a standing shock can be obtained from the above equations by a given pair of @xmath8 ( see appendix a of mtk for details ) .    the continuity equation and the euler equation are written as follows : & & + ( ) = 0  , [ masscon ] + & & + w+ = ^2  , [ euler ] where @xmath9 is the vorticity , and @xmath10 is the entropy .    apart from vorticity perturbations and acoustic waves in an isothermal flow , entropy perturbations should appear in an adiabatic flow .",
    "thus the linearized equations here are a little more complicated than those in paper i. in order to write out the linearized equations in the simplest form , the two functions @xmath11 are defined as follows : & & f + +  , [ feq ] + & & g +  , [ geq ] where @xmath12 is the perturbation of the bernoulli constant and @xmath13 is the perturbation of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the frequency @xmath14 measured in the rotating frame is defined as : & & - m  , where @xmath15 is the complex frequency of the perturbation , @xmath16 is the azimuthal wave number , and @xmath17 is the angular velocity . with the standard method of linear stability analysis , i.e. , assuming perturbations to be proportional to @xmath18 , the following differential system is obtained : = & & -f + g + & & + i(+ ) ^_^rr + & & + ^_^rr  , [ dfdr ] + = & & f -g + & & - ^_^rr + & & -^_^rr  , [ dgdr ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the vorticity along the rotation axis , @xmath21 is the radial mach number , and the subscript ",
    "sh \" denotes the shock position .",
    "the boundary conditions corresponding to a perturbed shock velocity @xmath22 are obtained : & & = ( _ + - _ - )  , [ fsh ] + & & = ( - )  , [ gsh ] + & & = -  , [ dssh ] + & & = 0  , [ bsh ] where the subscripts  - \" and  + \" denote the pre - shock and post - shock values , respectively .",
    "+ in addition to the two boundary conditions eqs.([fsh]-[gsh ] ) at the shock , a third equation is obtained from the critical condition at the sonic point , & & - f_son + g_son + ^_^r = 0  , [ critic ] where the subscript  son \" denotes the sonic point .",
    "these three boundary conditions are used to numerically solve the differential system eqs .",
    "( [ dfdr]-[dgdr ] ) and to determine the eigenfrequencies @xmath15 .    the methods for obtaining the above linearized equations and boundary conditions are similar to those in paper i ( see appendices b and c of paper i for details ) .",

    "thus the lowest post - shock mach number ( corresponding to extremely strong shocks ) is : @xmath25^{1\\over 2 } = 0.354 $ ] . tab .",
    "[ case15 ] presents a sample of 15 shocked accretion flows , of which cases 1 - 11 were exactly taken from table 1 of mtk . as shown in tab .",
    "[ case15 ] , for cases 1 - 11 , the ranges of the post - shock mach number @xmath26 and the minimum mach number in the subsonic region between the sonic point and the shock @xmath27 are a little narrow compared with the theoretical ones , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "thus cases 12 - 15 are added into tab .  [ case15 ] to make the ranges wider , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "our linear results for @xmath32 and mtk simulation results are listed on the sixth and seventh columns of tab .",
    "[ case15 ] , respectively .",
    "[ figle ] shows the domain @xmath8 of angular momentum and bernoulli constant for which an adiabatic flow , subsonic far from the accretor , may be accreted onto a black - hole through a stationary shock .",
    "each point between the two solid lines represents an inner shock ( post - shock acceleration ) and an outer shock ( post - shock deceleration ) .",
    "since the inner shock was already found to be unstable to axisymmetric perturbations , we will concentrate on the stability of the outer shock against non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "indicated on the left .",
    "the thin solid lines correspond to the value of the minimum mach number @xmath33 indicated on the right .",

    "the filled triangle represents case 9 , which is stable in mtk simulations .",

    "the filled circle represents case 15 , which is linearly stable.,width=302 ]    as shown in tab .",
    "[ case15 ] , our linear numerical calculations find that cases 1 - 14 are unstable , and case 15 is stable , whereas the non - linear simulations of mtk found that cases 1 - 11 are unstable except for case 9 .",
    "the agreement of linear and non - linear results can be understood as follows . in their simulations ,",
    "@xmath34 of the stable flow ( case 9 ) is the largest one ( among cases 1 - 11 ) .",
    "similarly , in our linear calculations , @xmath34 of the stable flow ( case 15 ) is also the largest one ( among cases 1 - 15 ) . thus both linear and non - linear results indicate that the shock is generally unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations except for @xmath35 , i.e. very weak shock .",
    "we therefore argue that there is no essential difference between linear and non - linear results .",
    "this general instability is even clear from fig .",
    "[ figle ] , which shows that both the linearly stable shock ( case 15 , filled circle ) and the non - linearly stable shock ( case 9 , filled triangle ) locate very close to the right border , whereas the other unstable shocks stand everywhere except for a very narrow region close to the right @xmath36 border .",
    ".,width=302 ]    as a typical example , the eigenspectrum of case 5 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figm ] for perturbations @xmath37 .",
    "the shock is linearly stable to axisymmetric perturbations ( @xmath38 ) , which coincides with the criterion  post - shock acceleration causes instability \" . despite the post - shock deceleration",

    "the mtk simulations found that , for case 5 , the perturbed axisymmetric shock will finally change into an @xmath32 deformed shock .",
    "such a non - linear evolution can be well explained by our numerically obtained eigenmodes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figm ] , the fastest growth rate correponds to @xmath32 , @xmath40 , which indicates that the @xmath32 perturbations should dominate over the others .",
    ".,width=302 ]    to understand the different behaviours of perturbed shocks in mtk simulations , we focus on cases 1 - 7 since there exists continuous change from 1 to 4 and from 5 to 7 , respectively .",
    "[ figgrow ] shows that the fastest growth rate correponds to @xmath32 for cases 1 and 5 .",
    "for the other five cases , however , the fastest growth rate does not correpond to @xmath32 . in other words , among cases 1 - 7 , @xmath32 perturbations dominate for cases 1 and 5 . as shown in tab",
    ".  [ case15 ] , mtk simulations found that the perturbed shock will change into an @xmath32 deformed shock for cases 1,2 and 5 . comparing the linear results with simulations ,",
    "we therefore conclude that the non - linear behaviours are determined by the fastest growth rate .",
    "the @xmath32 deformed shock , i.e.  regular oscillation \" , should come into being when the fastest growth rate correponds to @xmath32 . on the contrary ,",
    "other types such as  beating \" should appear when the fastest growth rate does not correpond to @xmath32 .",
    "the only inconsistent solution is case 2 . as shown in tab .",
    "[ case15 ] and fig .",
    "[ figgrow ] , from case 1 to 4 , the transition direction of the instability is identical for linear and non - linear results , i.e. , from @xmath32 dominance to @xmath41 dominance .",
    "the transition point locates between case 1 and 2 in our linear calculations , however , between case 2 and 3 in mtk simulations .",
    "as mentioned in mtk , the average distance of the final deformed shock will be a little larger than before .",
    "thus the outmoving of the shock may account for the above quantitative difference .       and",
    "@xmath42.,width=302 ]    in the isothermal work of paper i , the mechanism of the instability was already found to be based on the cycle of acoustic waves between the corotation radius and the shock .",
    "such a mechanism can be confirmed by the new evidence of fig .",
    "[ figwia ] , which shows 10 unstable eigenmodes for @xmath32 of case 12 .",
    "we choose case 12 because the shock is far away from the sonic point and @xmath33 is low enough , thus the flow has a number of unstable eigenmodes .",
    "different from the rough timescales @xmath43 and @xmath42 in paper i , here we numerically calculate the exact values of the time of the purely acoustic cycle @xmath43 and the advective - acoustic cycle @xmath42 : & & = _ ^ ( + ) r  , [ tac ] + & & = _ ^ ( + ) r  , [ tadv ] where the corotation radius @xmath44 of the perturbation is defined by @xmath45 , with @xmath46 : & & ( ) ^12  .",
    "[ rco ] fig .",
    "[ figwia ] shows that the growth time is always around @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath47 , but can be much shorter than @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath48 , which strongly indicates that the mechanism is based on the purely acoustic cycle , not the advective - acoustic cycle .",
    "however , such an evidence was not noticed in paper i.     and @xmath42.,width=302 ]    to have a global view , for @xmath32 , the most unstable modes of all the 15 flows are included in fig .",
    "[ figwib ] , which shows that for low @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath49 , the most unstable mode well matches @xmath47 .",
    "this result again confirms the above mentioned mechanism in adiabatic flows .",
    "the value of @xmath50 , however , evidently decreases as @xmath51 , which implies that the instability is suppressed by advection .",
    "different from fig .  5 of paper i , in fig .",
    "[ figwib ] here we choose @xmath33 as abscissa instead of @xmath34 because an adiabatic flow with @xmath52 can not have very low @xmath34 , and more importantly , @xmath33 implies the strength of advection .",

    "[ case15 ] together with the 24 isothermal flows from paper i , which shows the relationship among @xmath44 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath34 .",

    "[ figcoro ] suggests the following good approximation : & & = 1-  .",

    "thus eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) should work well in normal adiabatic flows with @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , we define the linear period @xmath59 for @xmath32 as follows , & &  , [ pl ] where @xmath60 is the real part of the eigenfrequency corresponding to the most unstable mode .    , the linear @xmath59 and the mtk simulation results @xmath61 . the upper and the lower dotted lines correspond to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively.,width=302 ]    the different types of periods",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ figp ] . the lower and the upper dotted lines correspond to the rotation period at the sonic point @xmath64 and at the shock @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "this figure shows that both the linear @xmath59 and the non - linear @xmath61 always locate between @xmath63 and @xmath62 ( except for case 2 ) , which is in good agreement with the condition that the corotation radius should locate between the sonic point and the shock .",
    "[ figp ] demonstrates that the analytical period @xmath66 is a good approximation for the linear period @xmath59 and not far from the non - linear period @xmath61 .",
    "as mentioned in mtk , the average distance of the final deformed shock will be a little larger than before .",
    "for example , in case 5 , the final distance @xmath56 varies between 9 - 11 , which is larger than the original value of 7.8 .",
    "if this outmoving is taken into consideration , @xmath65 should therefore be even larger thus @xmath61 of case 2 should indeed locate between @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "futhermore , the outmoving well explains why @xmath61 is always larger than @xmath59 and @xmath66 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ figp ] ) .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the general non - axisymmetric instability of the outer shock , which was previously found by non - linear simulations for adiabatic flows and linear calculations for isothermal flows , is confirmed in the present paper by linear calculations for adiabatic flows .",
    "the simulation results of mtk are well explained by our numerically obtained linear eigenmodes .",
    "new evidence is shown to support the argument in paper i for the mechanism that the instability is based on the cycle of acoustic waves between the corotation radius and the shock .",
    "an analytical formula is obtained to calculate the oscillation period @xmath67 from the physical parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath6 and @xmath34 .",
    "the present work is for an inviscid accretion flow with a standing radial shock .",
    "realistic astrophysical accretion flows must have viscosity , and it remains controversial whether a standing shock can indeed form in a viscous accretion flow around a black hole . in an accretion flow , the gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic and thermal energy of the accreting gas .",
    "based on the energy consideration , narayan , mahadevan & quataert ( 1998 ) identified three regimes of accretion : the radiative cooling - dominated accretion flow , the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , and the low energy generated accretion flow . for cooling - dominated flows or adafs ,",
    "the released gravitational potential energy is mainly converted to thermal energy by viscous stresses and then radiated away or advected into the central black hole . except for the region very close to the black hole ( @xmath68 ) , the radial motion of these two kinds of accretion flows keeps subsonic because of the low kinetic energy .",
    "this is the physical reason why there are no shocks in the adaf - thin disc solutions ( e.g. narayan , kato & honma 1997 , hereafter nkh ) , and this result does not rely on the mathematical technology .",
    "in fact , lu , gu & yuan ( 1999 ) recovered the shock - free adaf - thin disc solutions using the runge - kutta method ( by adjusting the specific angular momentum @xmath69 accreted by the black hole and the sonic point @xmath55 of an adaf to match a thin disc at the outer boundary ) , which are identical with those in nkh using the relaxation method ( by assuming the value of the outer boundary @xmath70 and the conditions at @xmath70 , and then solving the set of euqations and calculating out @xmath69 and @xmath55 as eigenvalues ) . in our opinion , a standing shock may form if the original flow belongs to the third regime mentioned above , i.e. a low energy generated accretion flow . if the flow has very low angular momentum @xmath6 at large distance , i.e. close to bondi accretion ( in an adaf @xmath6 is not very low , see fig.2 of nkh ) , the gravitational force dominates over the centrifugal force .",
    "the flow is accelerated efficiently in the radial direction and becomes supersonic far from the central black hole ( yuan 1999 ) , then a shock is likely to develop .",
    "such a flow is a low energy generated one because the released gravitational potential energy is mainly converted to kinetic energy rather than thermal energy .",
    "nkh has also agreed that this is the situation in which a shock can indeed be physical .",
    "thus we believe that flows with low angular momentum and weak viscosity ( i.e. low energy generation ) will have shocks .",
    "it is well - known that the ppi occurs with either an inner or an outer reflecting boundary , or even more efficiently with both .",
    "the boundary in the present paper is a standing shock .",
    "however , a shock is not the only type of boundary which can reflect acoustic waves .",
    "for example , the transition from a shakura - sunyaev disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) to an adaf ought to be very sharp ( nkh , manmoto & kato 2000 , lu , lin & gu 2004 ) .",
    "such a sharp transition surface can also reflect acoustic waves , thus the ppi may occur and result in the qpo in this system .",
    "we therefore argue that the qpo should be a common phenomenon in accretion flows with angular momentum .",
    "in particular , the qpo frequencies in a 3:2 ratio in black hole x - ray binaries ( mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) may be explained by this instability for both m=2 and m=3 dominance , such as cases 2 and 7 ( as shown in fig .  [ figgrow ] ) .",
    "we thank thierry foglizzo for helpful discussions . this work is supported by the national science foundation of china under grant nos.10233030 , 10503003 and the natural science foundation of fujian province under grant no.z0514001 .",
