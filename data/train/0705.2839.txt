    "the development of high - power lasers has made it possible to study the relativistic regime of laser - plasma interactions .",
    "this is of fundamental importance for laser - induced heating and inertial confinement fusion @xcite and poses also the possibility to test fundamental physics .",
    "the first theoretical studies of relativistic waves in plasmas date back to the fifties @xcite , where it was recognized that the the quivering velocity of electrons may lead to relativistic mass increase in an ultra - intense electromagnetic wave .",
    "the relativistic effects can result in self - modulation and self - focusing of electromagnetic waves in plasmas @xcite .",
    "the instability of relativistically large amplitude electromagnetic waves has been studied for magnetized electron plasmas @xcite , electron - ion plasmas @xcite , electron beam plasma systems @xcite , hot electron - ion plasmas @xcite , and magnetized hot plasmas @xcite .",
    "the instability of relativistically strong laser light in an unmagnetized plasma has then been revisited @xcite .",
    "the presence of multiple laser beams in a plasma can give rise to a new set of interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "an important application of two interacting laser beams in plasmas is the excitation of large amplitude langmuir waves , which in turn accelerate electrons to ultra - relativistic speeds @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear coupling between two electromagnetic waves in plasmas can be described by a system of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations that model nonlinear interactions between localized light @xcite and langmuir or ion - acoustic waves . at strongly relativistic intensities ,",
    "laser beams can give rise to fast plasma waves via higher - order nonlinearities @xcite , or via the beat wave excitation at frequencies different from the electron plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "particle - in - cell simulations @xcite show that large - amplitude electron plasma waves can be excited by colliding laser pulses , or by two co - propagating electromagnetic pulses where a long trailing pulse is modulated efficiently by the periodic plasma wake behind the heading short laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the effects on parametric instabilities of a partially incoherent pump wave ( with a distribution of wave modes ) was investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , where it was found that the effect of finite bandwidth is , in general , to increase the instability thresholds and lower the growth rate .",
    "the nonlinear interaction between two electromagnetic waves in the earth s ionosphere has also been considered @xcite . in that case , it is , in addition , important to focus attention on the collisional coupling between the waves , e.g. @xcite .",
    "related phenomena occur also in semiconductor plasmas @xcite .",
    "our previous treatment of the instability of two coupled laser beams in an electron - ion plasma @xcite and a two - temperature electron plasma @xcite were limited to the investigation of the relativistic raman and brillouin scattering instabilities in one dimension , and two - dimensional effects were only partly included .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to include the multi - dimensional effects , which are particularly important for the cases where an electromagnetic wave decays into one low - frequency wave and one high - frequency electrostatic wave that are propagating obliquely to the pump wave .",
    "let us consider the propagation of intense laser light in an electron  ion plasma .",
    "the dynamics of the high frequency laser light is governed by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath2 is the equilibrium number density , @xmath3 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath4 is the electron mass , @xmath5 is the electron thermal speed , @xmath6 is the speed of light , and the normalized slow time - scale electron number density perturbation is @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is excited by the ponderomotive force of the high frequency waves .",
    "if the ions are considered as immobile , we have @xcite @xmath8 whereas if the electrons are treated as inertialess @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sound speed .",
    "we will here consider two large amplitude electromagnetic waves @xmath11 .",
    "we then have @xmath12 .",
    "using equations ( 1)(3 ) we can now derive a nonlinear dispersion relation .",
    "the calculations are straightforward but lengthy .",
    "following closely the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , it then turns out to be convenient to introduce a characteristic velocity @xmath13 that is defined by @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the pump frequency and wavevector of the pump wave @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , whereas @xmath21 and @xmath22 are associated with the electrostatic low - frequency fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we have here introduced the pump wave quiver velocity @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the sideband damping @xcite , and @xmath26 . for the pump frequencies , we use @xmath27 .    in the present paper",

    "this means that double resonance parametric phenomena @xcite , where the difference between the frequencies @xmath29 and @xmath30 is close to twice a natural frequency , will be neglected . choosing two transverse waves that propagate in the @xmath31 and @xmath32-directions , respectively with the pump velocities in the @xmath33 and @xmath34-directions , respectively",

    "( [ dispersion ] ) but neglected those with subscripts `` + '' . for large wavenumbers , we recover almost identically the stimulated raman and brillouin cases treated in ref .",
    "thus , we shall here concentrate on the regimes of smaller wavenumbers in which the two - plasmon decay and ion parametric decay instabilities become important , and where it is crucial to have a fully multi - dimensional treatment .",

    "we have here denoted the unit vectors in the @xmath34 and @xmath32 directions by @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "1 , the electron thermal effects are investigated .",
    "the dispersion of the langmuir waves due to the electron pressure causes the instability to restricted in a bounded domain in wavevector space , with a maximum growth rate in a direction perpendicular to the propagation direction of the laser beam . in fig .",
    "2 , we have investigated how the instability depends on the pump wavenumber of a single electromagnetic beam .",
    "we find that the instability is dominant for wavenumbers equal to or larger than @xmath69 , and that the instability vanishes for smaller wavenumbers of the pump wave .",
    "the maximum instability occurs for wavevectors almost perpendicular to the laser beam propagation direction .",
    "the instability maximum occurs for wavenumbers much larger than the pump wavenumber .",
    "eventually kinetic effects will become important and electron landau damping will decrease the growth rate .",
    "the case of two coupled electromagnetic beams is investigated in fig .",

    "we next investigate the parametric decay instability in which the electromagnetic wave decays into one electrostatic wave and one low - frequency ion acoustic wave , where @xmath64 in eq .",

    "we have here concentrated on the long wavelength limit where the main instability is the ion parametric decay instability , in which the electromagnetic wave decays into one slightly frequency - downshifted electrostatic wave and one low - frequency ion acoustic wave . in fig .",

    "we see that for higher electron thermal and ion acoustic speeds , the region of instability becomes smaller in wavenumber space , and that there is a well - defined maximum of the instability for propagation almost perpendicular to the wave propagation direction . in fig . 5 , we have considered different wavenumbers of the pump wave .",
    "we see that for large wavenumbers , the maximum instability occurs for larger wavevectors perpendicular to the pump wavevector .",
    "finally , we consider the interaction between two coupled electromagnetic beams in fig .",

    "3 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the instability of two coupled large - amplitude electromagnetic waves in a plasma .",
    "our investigation shows that two - plasmon decay plays an important role for pump frequencies approximately two times larger than the background electron plasma frequency , and that one has a maximum growth rate perpendicular to the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave . for two coupled electromagnetic beams",
    ", there is here a new and stronger instability in a direction between the two laser beams . the ion parametric decay instability , in which an electromagnetic wave decays into one langmuir wave and one ion acoustic wave , is important for long wavelengths of the electromagnetic pump wave , where the instability leads to ion acoustic waves that are propagating perpendicularly to the electromagnetic beam direction . here",
    ", the addition of a second electromagnetic beam leads to a superposition of the instabilities .",
