    "projectile fragmentation has traditionally been thought of as a two - step reaction with excitation via a peripheral collision with the target followed by fragmentation of the projectile . in this framework , the influence of the mass and charge of the target nucleus on projectile fragmentation is a question of interest both with regard to the formation of the excited quasiprojectile and its subsequent fragmentation .",
    "the target nucleus may affect fragmentation of the projectile in various ways .",
    "charity et al .",
    "report the influence of the repulsive coulomb field of the target on the motion of the emitted charged particles @xcite .",
    "additionally , the influence of isospin equilibration on reaction dynamics has been studied at lower energies @xcite .",
    "de souza et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the nucleon exchange is regulated by the potential energy surface if isospin equilibration is allowed to occur . at low energies below 10 mev / nucleon , the studies of nucleon transfer @xcite showed deviations from the predictions of the commonly used model of nucleon exchange @xcite in the description of a proton and neutron drift . at intermediate energies up to 50 mev / nucleon",
    ", the model of nucleon exchange successfully describes the production of the projectile - like nuclei at forward angles @xcite .",
    "the influence of isospin on the cooling of the interacting system by emission of fast nucleons was observed in the study of multifragmentation of the systems @xmath1sn + @xmath1sn and @xmath2sn   + @xmath2sn at a broad range of impact parameters @xcite .    in the current study we present a continuation of our previous work on projectile multifragmentation of a @xmath0si beam in the reaction with @xmath1sn and @xmath2sn targets at 30 and 50 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "we select the events consisting of isotopically identified fragments in order to reconstruct the mass and charge of the fragmenting projectile - like nucleus .",
    "the @xmath5 difference of the sn isotopes used as targets is significant enough to permit the study of the influence of neutron excess on production and deexcitation of the projectile - like nucleus .",
    "the study is divided into several sections .",
    "we present a short description of the experimental setup , a discussion of the nucleon exchange ( dissipation ) mechanism , divided into an analysis of the experimental observables of the reconstructed quasiprojectile and a comparison to the results of simulations , and a discussion of multifragmentation of excited quasiprojectiles . finally a short summary will be presented .",
    "the experiment was done with a beam of @xmath0si impinging on @xmath61 mg/@xmath7 self supporting @xmath8sn targets .",
    "the beam was delivered at 30 and 50 mev / nucleon by the k500 superconducting cyclotron at the cyclotron institute of texas a&m university .",
    "the detector array faust @xcite consisted of 68 silicon - csi(tl ) telescopes covering polar angles from 2.3@xmath9 to 33.6@xmath9 in the laboratory system .",
    "each element is composed of a 300@xmath10 m surface barrier silicon detector followed by a 3 cm csi(tl ) crystal .",
    "the detectors are arranged in five concentric rings .",
    "the geometrical efficiency is approximately 90@xmath11 for the angle range covered .",
    "these detectors allow isotopic identification of light charged particles and intermediate - mass fragments up to a charge of @xmath12 .",
    "the energy thresholds are determined by the energy needed to punch through the 300@xmath13 m silicon detector .",
    "these energy thresholds have little effect on the acceptance of particles from the fragmenting projectile due to the boost from the beam energy .",
    "details of the experimental procedure and detector calibration can be found in ref .",
    "additional silicon telescopes complemented the forward array in the setup . a telescope consisting of a 53@xmath14 m silicon detector , 147@xmath14 m silicon strip detector ( 16 strips ) and a 994@xmath14 m silicon detector was placed at 40@xmath15 in the laboratory .",
    "the 53@xmath14 m and 994@xmath14 m silicons had an active area of 5 cm @xmath16 5 cm and were divided in four quadrants .",
    "this telescope covered the polar angle from 42.5@xmath15 to 82.2@xmath15 degrees .",
    "another silicon telescope was placed at 135@xmath15 in the lab , covering polar angles from 123@xmath15 to 147@xmath15 .",
    "it was composed of two 5@xmath175 cm active area silicon detectors of thickness 135@xmath14 m and 993@xmath14 m respectively .",
    "a 2 cm thick csi(tl ) detector read out via a photo - diode was placed behind both silicon pairs .    in the present study",
    "we restrict ourselves to the events where all emitted fragments are isotopically identified ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we assume that such events detected in the faust detector array originate predominantly from the deexcitation of the quasiprojectile ( or projectile - like source ) .",
    "the total charge of the reconstructed quasiprojectile ( qp ) is restricted to the values near the projectile charge ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this very selective data contains information on fragmentation of highly excited projectile - like prefragments , and thus can be used for the study of the mechanism of dissipation of the kinetic energy of relative motion into thermal degrees of freedom .",
    "the high granularity of faust , the moderate beam current , and the high selectivity of the events allowed us to minimize the number of pile - up signals .",
    "nucleon exchange is supposed to be a highly effective mechanism of dissipation of the kinetic energy of relative motion of the projectile and target into their internal degrees of freedom . in this section",
    "we present an overview of experimental observables of the reconstructed quasiprojectile and a comparison to the results of simulations .      in order to identify an emitting source from which the detected fragments originate , we reconstructed the velocity distributions of the quasiprojectiles with total charge @xmath19 for the set of events where all emitted fragments are isotopically identified . resulting velocity distributions for projectile energies 30 and 50 mev / nucleon",
    "are given on fig .",
    "[ vqpex]a , b .",
    "solid squares represent the reaction with @xmath1sn target and open squares reaction with @xmath2sn . for a given projectile energy ,",
    "the mean velocities and widths of distributions are practically identical for both targets .",
    "the velocity distributions are close to gaussians over two orders of magnitude ( gaussian fits are given as solid lines ) .",
    "the observed velocity distributions are symmetric and have no significant low or high energy tails .",
    "thus , the reconstructed quasiprojectiles may indeed be identified with the projectile - like fragment source .",
    "the admixture of particles from the midvelocity sources such as preequilibrium or neck emission , if any , does not distort the gaussian shape of the quasiprojectile velocity distributions .",
    "the mean velocities of the sources are somewhat lower than the velocity of the beam ( indicated by arrows ) , which indicates the damping of the kinetic energy into internal degrees of freedom .",
    "useful experimental information about the nucleon exchange rate can be found in the events where the charge of the reconstructed quasiprojectile is equal to the charge of incident beam ( @xmath20 ) . in this case",
    ", isospin equilibration may only occur by the transfer of neutrons , as the number of transferred neutrons is the only available isospin degree of freedom of the system .",
    "since the neutron number of the reconstructed quasiprojectile is just the sum of neutrons bound in the fragments with non - zero charge , we define the principal neutron exchange observable as the mass change . subtracting the sum of the neutrons bound in detected fragments from the neutron number of the beam",
    "gives    @xmath21    where @xmath22 14 for @xmath23si beam .",
    "a positive value of this observable means that the neutron number of the reconstructed quasiprojectile is lower than the neutron number of the projectile and one or more projectile neutrons have been lost by transfer to the target nucleus and/or by emission in the fragmentation stage .",
    "a positive value of @xmath24 may also be obtained in a collision where the transfer of one or more neutrons from the target to the projectile occurs but a larger number of neutrons is emitted later . finally , a negative value of @xmath24 means that the neutron flow from target to projectile is stronger than emission .",
    "the resulting mass change distributions for both projectile energies and target isotopes are shown in fig .",
    "[ munpex ] ( @xmath1sn - solid circles , @xmath2sn - open circles ) .",
    "the mass change depends on the target nucleus and beam energy . for both projectile energies",
    "the mean value of the mass change is larger for the reaction with the @xmath1sn target by a little more than half a unit ( 0.60 for 30 mev / nucleon and 0.65 for 50 mev / nucleon , see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , there could be more neutrons transferred from the target to the projectile during the interaction with @xmath2sn target , or there could be more neutrons emitted from the quasiprojectile that interacted with the @xmath1sn target , or more neutrons could be transferred from the projectile to the @xmath1sn target .",
    "the relative importance of different processes may be deduced from the sign of the mean values of the @xmath25 distributions .",
    "as one can see in table [ table1 ] , they are positive in all cases . for the events with @xmath20 , where the proton degree of freedom is fixed ,",
    "the only possible way to achieve isospin equilibrium of the interacting dinuclear system is with neutron flow from the target to the projectile .",
    "thus , especially in the case of neutron rich @xmath2sn target , the positive values of @xmath26 provide evidence for the influence of the neutron emission on the final neutron content of the quasiprojectile .",
    "indeed , when comparing the mean values of the mass change for the reactions with the same target nucleus at different projectile energies , the mean mass change significantly increases with an increase of beam energy from 30 to 50 mev / nucleon for @xmath1sn and 0.68 for @xmath2sn ) .    .",
    "mean values and widths of experimental distributions of the mass change and of the apparent quasiprojectile excitation energy ( @xmath27 ) for the fully isotopically resolved quasiprojectiles . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     additional understanding of quasiprojectile deexcitation may be obtained from the study of isotopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the overall values of the @xmath5 of the quasiprojectile are similar for the experiment and the simulations ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the results of simulation are slightly higher in all cases but the difference is within the statistical errors .",
    "the situation is significantly different when investigating the fragments of different charges independently . in fig .",
    "[ nzfrag ] , we present average @xmath5 ratios for fragments with different charges .",
    "the data presented applies to isotopically resolved events with @xmath19 .",
    "the results for subsets of data with @xmath20 are practically identical .",
    "experimental @xmath5 ratios show an excess of neutron rich fragments with @xmath28 relative to the simulation , counterbalanced by stronger dominance of protons among the fragments with @xmath29 .",
    "this may point out a higher decay probability of the excited neutron deficient quasiprojectiles or hot fragments for the channels with emission of stable charged particles like protons and @xmath30-particles .",
    "alternatively , the relative excess of protons may be caused by preequilibrium emission , especially in the case of less neutron rich target @xmath1sn . when comparing the sensitivity of experimental @xmath5 ratios to the neutron content of the target at given projectile energy , the @xmath5 ratios of fragments with @xmath29 and @xmath31 show the highest sensitivity .",
    "this trend was reported in our previous study where a broader set of data was presented @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath32li , which could be influenced by an admixture of the two @xmath33-particle decay of short - lived @xmath32be , we compared the experimental and simulated values of the isotopic ratio y(@xmath32li)/y(@xmath34li ) for different bins of the isospin of the quasiprojectile .",
    "detection of @xmath32be was a priori excluded in the simulation .",
    "we found no significant deviations between experimental data and simulation , which allows us to conclude that the admixture of @xmath32be in the yield of @xmath32li does not dramatically influence the results of our analysis .    in summary , the overall description of the experimental data on charged particle multiplicity",
    ", charge distributions and isotopic ratios may be considered as reasonable in general .",
    "the remaining minor inconsistencies may be attributed to the limitations in the model description of quasiprojectile deexcitation and/or to the influence of preequilibrium emission .",
    "these inconsistencies , however , do not influence conclusions concerning the mechanism of nucleon exchange given in previous section .",
    "using the faust detector array we obtained a set of fully isotopically resolved projectile multifragmentation events ( @xmath35 ) from the reactions @xmath0si+@xmath8sn at projectile energies 30 and 50 mev / nucleon .",
    "we have been able to reconstruct the mass , charge and dynamic observables of the excited quasiprojectile and to study the nucleon exchange between projectile and target .",
    "the reconstructed velocity distributions of the emitting source have been fitted using one gaussian source .",
    "thus admixtures from a midvelocity source may be excluded . at a given projectile energy",
    ", we observed an influence of the target isospin on the mass change of the reconstructed quasiprojectiles that have the charge of the beam .",
    "however , we observed no significant influence of the target isospin on the apparent excitation energy distribution .",
    "reactions with a heavier target isotope result in lower average mass change . this may be seen as evidence for partial equilibration of isospin in the early stage of the reaction . in the reactions with the same target",
    "the mass change increases with increasing projectile energy .",
    "this corresponds to a shift in the distributions of apparent quasiprojectile excitation energies toward higher values .",
    "the influence of the target isospin and of the projectile energy on the neutron content of the reconstructed quasiprojectiles can be explained by a two stage model consisting of nucleon exchange in the early stage of collision followed by deexcitation of the quasiprojectile .",
    "the experimental observables for different subsets of data were reproduced using a simulation using the concept of deep inelastic transfer in the early stage followed by quasiprojectile multifragmentation and sequential decay of the hot fragments .",
    "the deexcitation of the excited quasitarget and the preequilibrium emission were not taken into account in our simulation .",
    "distributions of the mass change and apparent excitation energy of reconstructed quasiprojectiles have been reproduced with good overall agreement .",
    "the charged fragment multiplicities , charge distributions and @xmath5 ratios for different fragment charges imply lower experimental survival probability of neutron deficient fragments towards decay into stable light charged particles than predicted by the simulation .",
    "we observed a maximum of the sensitivity of the @xmath5 ratios to the target isospin for the fragment charges @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "the contributing range of impact parameters was estimated by backtracing the simulated data ( @xmath36 ) indicating that the collisions may be considered as nearly peripheral .",
    "observables related to target multifragmentation and preequilibrium emission imply that neither of the processes causes significant distortion of the physical picture used in the simulation .",
    "the backtracing of simulated data allowed an estimation of the multiplicity of neutrons emitted from the quasiprojectile in the deexcitation stage .",
    "the estimated neutron multiplicities allowed further determination of the corresponding level of isospin equilibration between projectile and target during the nucleon exchange stage , which strongly depends on target isospin .",
    "the present work shows that deep inelastic transfer is the dominant production mechanism of highly excited quasiprojectiles in peripheral collisions in the fermi energy domain and that such collisions are suitable for detailed studies of thermal multifragmentation .",
