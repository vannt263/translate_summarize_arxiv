    "recently , a series of experimental studies  @xcite with low - temperature stm ( scanning tunnelling microscope ) revealed that isolated adsorbates on a surface could exhibit a magnetic structure , i.e. that a local spin could be attributed to the adsorbate .",
    "interaction of this local spin with its environment results in several magnetic energy levels that correspond to different orientations of the local spin relative to the substrate . a magnetic field , b ,",
    "was also applied to the system : increasing the b field decouples the local spin from its environment and the system switches to a zeeman structure , thus helping to characterize the adsorbate magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the energy of the various magnetic levels were obtained via a low - t iets ( low - temperature inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy ) experiment , in which the tip - adsorbate junction conductivity as a function of the stm bias exhibits steps at the magnetic excitation thresholds .",
    "the magnetic excitation energies are small , typically in the few mev range .",
    "besides the spectroscopy properties , the iets experiments also revealed that the conductance steps at the magnetic inelastic thresholds are very high , i.e. that the efficiency of the tunneling electrons in inducing magnetic transitions in the adsorbate is extremely large . in metal - phthalocyanine adsorbates for example",
    "@xcite , the tunneling current is dominated by its inelastic component when the bias is above the magnetic excitation thresholds .",
    "this efficiency is at variance with the efficiency of tunneling electrons in exciting vibrational modes in a molecular adsorbate which was observed and shown to only reach the few % range  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical accounts of the magnetic excitation process have been reported based on perturbation theory  @xcite , or on a strong coupling approach  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the strong coupling approach quantitatively accounted for the very large efficiency of tunneling electrons in inducing magnetic transitions  @xcite",
    ".    the existence on a surface of nano - magnets , the orientation of which could be changed at will by tunneling electrons , opens fascinating perspectives for the miniaturization of electronics . however , to lead to easily manageable devices , the excitation of local spins must have , among other properties , a sufficiently long lifetime .",
    "it is thus of paramount importance to know the decay rate of the excited levels of the local spin and in particular to decipher the various parameters and effects that govern its magnitude .",
    "experimentally , the local spins were observed in systems in which a coating on the surface was separating the magnetic adsorbate carrying the local spin from the metal substrate .",
    "experiments on adsorbates directly deposited on a metallic substrate did not lead to sharp iets structures  @xcite as the others and this was attributed to a too short lifetime of the magnetic excitation on metals , stressing the importance of the decoupling layer between local spin and substrate in stabilizing the magnetic excitation .",
    "deexcitation of a local spin implies an energy transfer from the local spin to the substrate degrees of freedom , i.e. to the substrate electrons or to phonons .",
    "phonons are not directly coupled to spin variables , but only via spin - orbit couplings ( see e.g. a discussion in [ ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the adsorbate spin variables can be directly coupled to substrate electrons and electrons colliding on a magnetic adsorbate can easily induce magnetic transitions .",
    "actually , this is exactly what happens in the magnetic excitation induced by tunneling electrons in the iets experiments described above ; in the de - excitation process the tunneling electrons are simply replaced by substrate electrons .",
    "the decay of excited magnetic states in individual adsorbates thus proceeds via electron - hole pair creation .",
    "substrate electrons colliding on the adsorbate can be thought to be as efficient in inducing magnetic transitions as tunneling electrons injected from an stm tip . in this qualitative view",
    ", one can expect the magnetic excitation decay rate to be the product of the collision rate of substrate electrons on the adsorbate by a very high efficiency factor .",
    "recently , the decay rate of excited magnetic mn atoms adsorbed on cun / cu(100 ) has been measured by loth et al  @xcite via the analysis of the dependence of the adsorbate conductivity on the tunneling current .",
    "the decay of the magnetic excitations was interpreted in the above scheme as a decay induced by collision with substrate electrons .",
    "the lifetimes of magnetic excitations were typically found to be of the order of a fraction of ns . in the present paper ,",
    "we report on a theoretical ab initio study of the lifetime of magnetic excitations in the mn / cun / cu(100 ) system using both a dft - based ( density functional theory ) description of the system and the strong coupling formalism  @xcite developed to treat magnetic transitions induced by tunneling electrons ; the corresponding results are compared with loth et al data  @xcite .",
    "the present treatment of the decay of magnetic excitations closely parallels our earlier treatment of magnetic excitations in iets ( see details in ref . [ ] ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetic levels of the adsorbate can be described by the following magnetic anisotropy hamiltonian  @xcite ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the local spin of the adsorbate , @xmath2 the land factor and @xmath3 the bohr magneton .",

    "the decay rate , @xmath13 , of an excited state , @xmath7 , eigenstate of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonien ] ) with energy @xmath9 , is the inverse of its lifetime @xmath14 and it can then be written using matrix elements of the t transition matrix ( we assume the energy variation of the t matrix to be small on the energy scale of the @xmath15 transition and we assume a vanishing temperature of the substrate )  @xcite ,    @xmath16    where @xmath7 are the final states of the decay , associated to an energy transfer of @xmath17 , and the total energy is @xmath18 .",
    "the initial and final states of the substrate electrons are noted by their wave numbers , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and by their initial and final spin projections on the quantization axis , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the substrate is assumed to be non - magnetic .",
    "each term , @xmath23 , in the sum over @xmath24 is the partial decay rate of the initial state to a peculiar final state .",
    "the electron - adsorbate collisions being very fast , we can treat them without the magnetic anisotropy ( hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonien ] ) ) taken into account and later , include it in the sudden approximation .",
    "the electron - adsorbate collision is treated in a dft - based approach ( see section [ dft - model ] below ) whereas the spin transitions are treated in the sudden approximation in a way similar to our earlier study of magnetic excitation  @xcite .",
    "we thus define a collision amplitude for the substrate electrons independently of the magnetic anisotropy , it is a function of both the initial and final electron momenta , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and of the spin coupling between electron and adsorbate .",
    "the electron - adsorbate spin coupling scheme is defined via , @xmath25 , the total spin of the electron - adsorbate system : @xmath26 , where @xmath1 is the adsorbate spin and @xmath27 is the tunneling electron spin .",
    "the projection of @xmath25 on the quantization axis is noted @xmath28 . if the adsorbate spin is @xmath29 , there are two collision channels corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the decay rate is then expressed as a function of the two channel amplitudes , @xmath32 :    @xmath33    that can be re - expressed as : @xmath34    one can see that the contributions from the two @xmath35 terms are interfering .",
    "this corresponds to the _ a priori _ general case where no selection rule apply to the tunnelling process . in that case , the above expresion can be simplified by making an extra statistical approximation that neglects the interferences between the two @xmath35 channels . however , in our earlier studies on excitation processes  @xcite it was found that one of the two @xmath35 channels was dominating the tunneling process between tip and adsorbate . here for deexcitation in the mn on cun / cu(100 ) system , only one @xmath35 coupling scheme does contribute significantly to the collision between substrate electrons and adsorbate ( see section [ dft - model ] ) and is thus included in the present treatment .",
    "one can note though that the dominating channel for the deexcitation process ( collisions with electrons coming from the substrate ) is different from that dominating the excitation ( collision with tunnelling electrons ) ( see section [ dft - model ] ) .",
    "if one considers a single @xmath35 channel , the decay rate can be rewritten as :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a matrix element of spin variables only , corresponding to the @xmath35 coupling scheme for the @xmath38 transition .",
    "equation ( [ eq_av_chann ] ) then becomes :    @xmath39    the total and partial decay rates are then obtained via :    @xmath40    each partial decay rate thus appears as the product of a spin transition probability by the electron flux hitting the adsorbate in the energy range able to perform the studied transition .",
    "as we will see below , the dft - based calculation of the electron flux is not performed in the @xmath35 , @xmath28 spin coupling base , but by specifying the scattering electron spin state ( majority or minority ) .",
    "thus we can not perform a one to one identification .",
    "however , scattering through the adsorbate being dominated by a @xmath35 channel , we can identify the electron flux in the @xmath35 channel ( @xmath41 ) with its equivalent in the dft - approach , the total electron flux hitting the adsorbate @xmath42 . so that finally , the total decay rate is obtained as :    @xmath43    the decay rate is then equal to the total flux of substrate electrons hitting the adsorbate per second in the appropriate energy range , @xmath44 , times a spin transition probability .",
    "below , @xmath42 is identified with the equivalent quantity computed in the dft approach ( section [ dft - model ] ) .",
