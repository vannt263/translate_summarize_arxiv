    "<S> we construct one soliton solutions for the nonlinear schrdinger equation with variable quadratic hamiltonians in a unified form by taking advantage of a complete ( super ) integrability of generalized harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton wave evolution in external fields with variable quadratic potentials is totally determined by the linear problem , like motion of a classical particle with acceleration , and the ( self - similar ) soliton shape is due to a subtle balance between the linear hamiltonian ( dispersion and potential ) and nonlinearity in the schrdinger equation by the standards of soliton theory . </S>",
    "<S> most linear ( hypergeometric , bessel ) and a few nonlinear ( jacobian elliptic , second painlev transcendental ) classical special functions of mathematical physics are linked together through these solutions , thus providing a variety of nonlinear integrable cases . </S>",
    "<S> examples include bright and dark solitons , and jacobi elliptic and second painlev transcendental solutions for several variable hamiltonians that are important for current research in nonlinear optics and bose  einstein condensation . </S>",
