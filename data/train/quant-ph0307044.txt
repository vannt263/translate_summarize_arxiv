    "the most widespread interpretation of quantum mechanics follows a pragmatic approach , starting with the request not to attribute a deep meaning to the wave function but immediately go over to probabilities @xcite .",
    "the randomness exists as a postulate , the born rule defines the probability @xmath0 from the wave function @xmath1 , and the von neumann projection postulate for the wave function or density matrix tells us how to deal with repeated measurements and calculate correlators .",
    "schrdinger cats do not exist ( as no meaning is attributed to the wave function except for providing a tool to determine probabilities ) and the separation between the quantum and the classical worlds appears to be arbitrary .    within this pragmatic approach , the collapse of the wave function in the measurement process appears as a particularly mysterious step : consider an initial state @xmath2 describing the microscopic quantum system ( @xmath3 ) and the macroscopic measurement device ( @xmath4 , a reservoir in some metastable state ) .",
    "following standard arguments @xcite , the measurement process involves two related operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( with eigenstates @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) acting on the microscopic quantum system and the macroscopic meter , respectively .",
    "after the measurement process , the systems state can be expressed in the basis @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the measurement operators , where the eigenvalue @xmath9 describes the meter reading of the apparatus , @xmath10 and with the coefficients @xmath11 related to the initial state @xmath3 of the quantum system .",
    "it is the superposition of orthogonal macroscopic meter states ( allowing for a classical reading ) which is the problematic aspect of the cat state ( [ cat ] ) .",
    "its _ ad hoc _ resolution then invokes a collapse of the wave function by requiring a unique classical meter reading @xcite , resulting ( with probability @xmath12 ) in the collapsed wave function @xmath13 and the systems localization in the state @xmath14 after the measurement . hence , we conclude that the wave function collapse is not realized within the frame given by ordinary quantum mechanics and the question arises why this is so , is this only a technical problem due to the macroscopic nature and the complexity of the measurement apparatus or is some hidden new physics required for its resolution ?    here , we wish to pursue the idea that the wave function collapse could be explained within the framework of quantum mechanics alone , i.e. , based on a unitary evolution of the initial state ( [ init ] ) .",
    "we are immediately confronted with two problems : _",
    "i ) _ combining linearity with unitary evolution seemingly produces schrdinger cat states ( [ cat ] ) rather than localized states of the type ( [ coll ] ) ; and _ ii ) _ the unitary evolution to a localized state ( [ coll ] ) deprives us from the element of randomness in the theory and the question poses itself how the concept of probability ( with the correct born rule ) can be recovered .",
    "below , we will argue that the _ traditional _ derivation of the schrdinger cat state suffers from the problem of inappropriate initial conditions .",
    "we will show that the appearance of a schrdinger cat state requires the presence of a superposed macroscopic preparation device already to begin with ; the deliberate creation of a schrdinger cat state then becomes a non - trivial issue .",
    "in fact , as of now it is unclear whether a carefully prepared state indeed develops into a schrdinger cat state under unitary evolution : the confirmation of the appearance of a schrdinger cat state requires calculation of the unitary time evolution of the entangled ground state comprising the particle and a macroscopic preparation device ; in principle , this could be done using standard tools @xcite , but no answer has been given so far .",
    "a dramatic simplification of this task is expected when the environment states are averaged over , e.g. , at finite temperatures ; unfortunately , using standard tools , the information about the presence or absence of schrdinger cat states is lost in the averaging process .",
    "below , we introduce a new type of wave - function correlator allowing to decide on the appearance of schrdinger cat states even after averaging and we discuss first results obtained with the help of this technique . also , with respect to point _",
    "ii ) _ raised above , we will argue that the element of randomness appears naturally through the indeterminacy of the initial state of the macroscopic environment which appears in the preparation of the physically correct initial quantum state and in its measurement .",
    "let us discuss first the traditional argument leading to the appearance of schrdinger cat states . to fix ideas we consider a double - well potential with semiclassical states @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( particle in the left / right well , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : elec ] ) coupled to a macroscopic reservoir @xmath17 serving as a meter ( the macroscopic cat ) .",
    "the usual schrdinger cat argument assumes that the individual product states involving the quantum system and an unpolarized reservoir @xmath18 evolve into polarized states @xmath19 the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the macroscopic polarized states of the detector after the measurement .",
    "assuming linearity , it is concluded that the state @xmath22\\otimes |{\\bf m}_{\\rm up}\\rangle$ ] evolves into a schrdinger cat state , @xmath23\\otimes |{\\bf m}_{\\rm up}\\rangle \\rightarrow     |l\\rangle \\otimes |{\\bf m}_{l}\\rangle+     |r\\rangle \\otimes |{\\bf m}_{r}\\rangle ;     \\label{sup_evol}\\ ] ] it is the superposition of the macroscopic reservoir ( the cat ) which is the problematic aspect of the state ( [ sup_evol ] ) , cf .  also ( [ cat ] ) .",
    "the underlying mistake in the above schrdinger cat argument is the assumption that the whole procedure can be carried out with a single unitary evolution . on the contrary , in order to realize the evolution in ( [ sip_evol ] ) the well has to be externally biased ( e.g. , through a linear potential tilting the double - well ) in order to prevent the particle from leaving the left ( right ) well during the time evolution associated with the measurement ; hence ( [ sip_evol ] ) involves the biased unitary evolutions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", the evolution ( [ sup_evol ] ) _ has to _ proceed without any bias and hence involves a different unitary operator @xmath26 .",
    "we conclude that this simplistic manner to create a cat state can not work .     for state preparation",
    ": @xmath27 : biased state , @xmath28 : unbiased but polarized state , @xmath29 : unbiased state without polarization . ]",
    "we then consider a more sophisticated setup for the construction of a schrdinger cat state . in our second attempt",
    "we want to use the same unbiased unitary evolution in the measurement process ( i.e. , at times @xmath30 ) both for the individual wave functions ( @xmath31 ) and for the superposed state ( @xmath22 \\otimes\\dots$ ] ) .",
    "we then have to be careful how to prepare the superposed state at times @xmath32 . to be specific",
    ", we again consider the setup shown in fig.[fig : elec ] , with a charged particle trapped in a symmetric double - well potential set up electrostatically .",
    "in addition , we account for additional polarization charges @xmath33 and @xmath34 induced by a classical bias voltage @xmath35  the polarization charges plus switches define our preparation device .",
    "we then prepare the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 by an appropriate biasing of the double - well potential , e.g. , via closing the switches @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ( position @xmath27 ) . at the time @xmath40",
    "we remove the classical bias @xmath35 ( switches in position @xmath28 ) , hence at times @xmath41 the hamiltonian describing the setup is symmetric .",
    "different from before , where a classical external bias was entering the hamiltonian at @xmath42 , here , the macroscopic preparation device disconnected from the classical external bias is now a part of the system and its time evolution has to be accounted for in the overall evolution .",
    "next , we connect the system to the unpolarized measuring apparatus @xmath43 . assuming that large polarization charges remain on the left ( right ) well",
    ", the two states will propagate under the same unbiased unitary evolution according to @xmath44 and similar for @xmath45 . making use of linearity",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , the evolution is again towards a cat state ( involving the macroscopic meter states @xmath47 ) ; however , different from the traditional analysis , here , the original state at @xmath40 is already a cat state as it involves the superposition of the macroscopic preparation device @xmath48 , cf .",
    "[ fig : cat_sk ] . in the end",
    ", we could rescue the basic construction of a schrdinger cat state by moving the asymmetry hidden in the hamiltonian of the traditional argument into a preparator device which now is a part of the system .",
    "the history of this preparator then is imprinted in the initial condition of the system .",
    "the inclusion of this preparator can not be avoided : removing the macroscopic polarization clouds holding the particle in the left- or right well , e.g. , via switching into the position @xmath29 , the evolution ( [ mac_evol ] ) is no longer guaranteed ( as the particle can delocalize between the wells ) and the whole argument is spoiled .",
    "in fact , let us prepare the @xmath40 state @xmath49 and then turn the switch @xmath38 into the position @xmath29 such as to let the particle evolve into a delocalized state involving both semi - classical states @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( with amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) . at the time @xmath52 our prepared state takes the superposed ( @xmath53 ) form @xmath54 ,     \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the polarization states of the left / right cloud if the preparator was initially left - polarized at @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the particle is entangled with the reservoir that is still carrying the information of the initial state @xmath57 ; in the standard schrdinger cat argument , this state is approximated in terms of the product state @xmath58 \\otimes |{\\bf p}_{\\rm up}\\rangle$ ] .     and",

    "the ` strange ' preparator and cat in the last row are macroscopic superpositions of the happy and unhappy preparator / cat appearing in the first two rows .",
    "we argue , that in order to construct a cat state along the traditional argument involving linearity and unitarity , a superposition of the macroscopic preparator is required  a final cat state requires an initial cat state to begin with . ]",
    "let us measure the state of the system at the time @xmath60 ( without loss of generality , @xmath61 ) : given the initial state @xmath62 , we can not _ a priori _ predict the outcome of this measurement knowing only the evolution ( [ mac_cat_evol ] ) , as the partly polarized reservoir states @xmath63 and @xmath64 _ differ _ from the fully polarized states @xmath57 and @xmath65 .",
    "at the present moment the answer to this correctly posed problem is unknown  the answer may describe a wave function localized in one well , but also , we can not exclude an evolution towards a @xmath66 schrdinger cat state involving a superposition of macroscopic reservoir states .    summarizing",
    ", we have seen that the traditional method to ` create ' a schrdinger cat state can not work  on the contrary , the initialization of such a cat state is itself a non - trivial task involving the entanglement of the quantum system with a macroscopic preparation device .",
    "the time evolution of the macroscopic preparator then has to be accounted for in the further evolution of the system .",
    "this demanding task has been solved for some special cases @xcite : consider a particle in a double - well potential and coupled to an ohmic environment @xmath67 at zero temperature ( we use the general term ` environment ' for a reservoir which may act as a preparator , a measurement device , or both ) .",
    "starting from a polarized state @xmath68 ( i.e. , a particle prepared in the left well at @xmath40 ) it has been found @xcite that , depending on the coupling strength @xmath69 , the system evolves into a collapsed state ( the particle remains in the left well ) if the coupling @xmath70 is strong , while for weak coupling @xmath71 the particle is delocalized between the wells ( quantum coherent for @xmath72 and semi - classically for @xmath73 ) .",
    "hence , a strongly coupled reservoir ( @xmath70 ) defines a good preparator / meter ( leading to a wave function collapse ) , while a weakly coupled reservoir ( @xmath71 ) does neither produce a measurement nor does it lead to a cat state .",
    "the question whether and under which conditions a carefully prepared delocalized state @xmath74 ( @xmath53 for superposition ) of the type ( [ prep ] ) evolves into a schrdinger cat or into a collapsed state defines a demanding problem which has not been pursued so far ; we note , however , that such a calculation could be carried out using standard tools , e.g. , via the determination of the occupational asymmetry @xmath75_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}$ ] at asymptotically large times ( here , @xmath76 denotes the probability to find the particle in the left ( right ) well at time @xmath77 ) .",
    "the task of identifying a schrdinger cat state in a properly defined setup may be simplified dramatically if the environmental degrees of freedom could be averaged over some ensemble , e.g. , a finite temperature gibbs ensemble .",
    "the standard route involves the calculation of the density matrix with an averaging over the reservoir degrees of freedom .",
    "the diagonal elements are referred to as the probabilities to find the particle in some specific state  they do not tell whether the wave function has collapsed or not . usually , it is the vanishing of the off - diagonal matrix elements due to decoherence which is taken as a signal for the collapse of the wave function , a conclusion which has lead to some dispute recently @xcite . here , analyzing a simple counterexample @xcite , we argue that the vanishing of the off - diagonal elements in the density matrix can not be taken as a proof for the collapse of the particle s wave function .",
    "consider the wave function ( we switch to coordinate representation for convenience ) @xmath78 describing a particle delocalized between the left and right states of a double - well potential , @xmath79 .",
    "let the reservoir states assume the properties of normalization , @xmath80 , and orthogonality @xmath81 .",
    "calculating the off - diagonal density matrix element by taking the average over the reservoir coordinates , @xmath82 \\psi^*(x_l,{\\bf y})\\psi(x_r,{\\bf y } )      \\label{od - dm}\\\\      & = & \\nu_l^ * \\nu_r \\int d[{\\bf y}]\\phi_l^*({\\bf y } )     \\phi_r({\\bf y } ) = 0,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain a zero result even for coefficients @xmath83 , i.e. , while the wave function is delocalized , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are zero . in a more complex example",
    "@xcite where the reservoir is modelled as a fluctuating classical force , again , the particle wave function remains delocalized while the off - diagonal elements in the density matrix are shown to vanish .",
    "this inability to discuss the collapse of the wave function within a density matrix description is related to the loss of information in the averaging procedure over the initial states of the reservoir .",
    "in fact , at finite temperatures , the asymmetry @xmath84 introduced above has to be averaged over the thermal distribution of reservoir states .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath66 case , the finite temperature version @xmath85 vanishes identically for all values of the coupling @xmath69 ( we start from a @xmath40 polarized equilibrium state ) .",
    "this zero result can appear in two different ways : _",
    "i ) _ depending on the initial state @xmath86 of the reservoir the probabilities @xmath87 to find the particle in the left ( right ) well are either 0 or 1 and the final probability @xmath88 vanishes only after averaging over initial states @xmath86 ; in this case the particle becomes localized for every given state @xmath86 of the reservoir . _",
    "ii ) _ for all initial states @xmath86 of the reservoir , the particle remains delocalized and @xmath89 ; the asymmetry @xmath90 already vanishes for each reservoir state @xmath86 alone .",
    "hence , studying the occupational asymmetry @xmath91 or the diagonal density matrix elements @xmath92 we can not decide whether the particle becomes localized or not .",
    "from the above discussion , we conclude that the density matrix is insufficient to discuss a possible localization of the particle by the reservoir at finite temperatures . this density matrix can be considered as the most general second - order ( equal time ) correlator for the wave function @xmath1 .",
    "an analytic tool providing an answer on the issue of the collapse of the wave function then has to involve higher - order correlators of the @xmath1-function .",
    "as we are going to show now , the calculation of a fourth - order correlator allows to separate extended from localized wave functions .",
    "hence , in order to decide on the appearance of schrdinger cat states we propose to calculate the correlator @xmath93 with @xmath94 the gibbs weights .",
    "the vanishing of ( [ correlator ] ) then tells us that the particle becomes localized ; in this case , the number of ensemble states producing delocalized cat states is of measure zero . on the other hand , a finite value @xmath95 points to the presence of schrdinger cat states @xcite .",
    "we note that the correlator ( [ correlator ] ) used here for the identification of cat states is reminiscent of the participation ratio @xcite used in the problem of anderson localization where it serves a similar task , the separation from extended and localized wave functions , in another context .    using the property @xmath96",
    ", we can equivalently study the second moment @xmath97 ; the calculation of higher moments @xmath98 then allows for the determination of the full distribution function @xmath99 $ ] of the random variable @xmath100 , given a distribution @xmath94 of initial states of the reservoir .",
    "such a calculation has been carried out @xcite for the model describing a particle trapped in a double - well potential and subject to a classical fluctuating field @xmath101 ( producing a fluctuating energy difference between the wells ) with gaussian correlations @xmath102 .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) then is replaced by the expression @xmath103 { p}[\\eta(\\tau ) ]     { \\cal p}^k_{l\\rightarrow l}([\\eta],t ) ,     \\label{correlator_phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 $ ] denotes the weight of the particular realization @xmath105 .",
    "the result turns out quite non - trivial with moments @xmath106 , resulting in a homogeneous distribution of the random variable @xmath107 . interpreting the two - level system @xmath108 in terms of a spin variable @xmath109",
    ", we find that after sufficiently long times an initial state @xmath110 points into an arbitrary direction with equal probability  for a given realization @xmath105 the particle is delocalized and remains coherent , while its density matrix ( after averaging over @xmath111 ) has zero off - diagonal elements .",
    "let us return to the question whether the wave function collapse could be explained within quantum mechanics itself : a scheme fulfilling this task should describe _ a ) _ the crossover from quantum to classical behavior , e.g. , as a function of size or coupling , _",
    "b ) _ it should describe the collapse of the wave function ( reduction of the wave packet ) , _ c ) _ it should explain the appearance of probability , and _",
    "d ) _ it should produce the correct probability as given by the born rule . in our approach",
    "it is the reservoir which plays a central role  we have argued that it appears unavoidably already in the preparation stage of an experiment and it introduces the element of randomness into the theory . on the one hand ,",
    "the scheme takes the form of a deterministic theory , with the microscopic state of the reservoir uniquely determining the outcome of the measurement . on the other hand",
    ", the microscopic state of the reservoir is not known in practice ( this is implied by the definition of the term ` reservoir ' ) and this is the basic element responsible for the appearance of randomness .",
    "we call our scheme describing the wave function collapse ( reduction ) within the framework defined by the rules of quantum mechanics ( unitary evolution ) and with the reservoir providing the element of randomness as the ` r from u scheme ' ( reduction from unitary evolution ) .",
    "the scheme is reminiscent of von neumann s hidden variable theory , against which he constructed two powerful arguments @xcite ; we briefly discuss their implication for our r from u scheme .",
    "the first argument is about ` dispersionless ensembles ' : an ensemble @xmath112 is called ` dispersionless ' if for all hermitian operators @xmath113 , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "there are no dispersionless ensembles @xcite , hence even an ensemble made from a single state @xmath116 exhibits dispersion .",
    "thus randomness is an intrinsic property of quantum mechanics and there are no hidden variables .  in the r from u theory , the intrinsic randomness is replaced by the indeterminacy of the initial state of the macroscopic reservoir and hence the degrees of freedom of the reservoir play the role of hidden variables .",
    "while in the von neumann argument observables are abstract operators acting within the hilbert space of the quantum system , in the r from u theory , the measurement of each such observable requires the introduction of its own measuring device and its associated hilbert space .",
    "contrary to the situation studied by von neumann where all operators act on the same ensemble , here , the ensemble is specified by the measurement apparatus .    the second argument deals with the born rule : given an initial density matrix in the product form @xmath117 with the particle in a pure state @xmath118 , the unitary evolution describing the measurement process produces the result @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "assuming that the reservoir state @xmath121 uniquely determines the outcome of the measurement , i.e. , @xmath122 , we arrive at the result @xmath123 and the probability to measure the @xmath124-th meter state is given by the probability @xmath94 , independent of the initial state @xmath116 of the particle ( note that here , all of the weight in @xmath125 collapses to @xmath126 and not only a fraction @xmath127\\phi_n({\\bf y})$ ] involving a superposition of the quantum system can not be prepared without a preparation device , see ( [ prep ] ) ; the latter has to be accounted for in the evolution of the measurement process . as argued above",
    ", the true wave function is not a simple direct product state but takes the form ( [ prep ] ) ; the partially polarized reservoir states @xmath128 have encoded into them the amplitudes @xmath129 of the initial superposed state and , in order for the r from u scheme to work out , the outcome of the measurement should depend on these amplitudes such as to produce the correct born rule .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the construction of a schrdinger cat state and its identification in a measurement is a highly non - trivial issue involving the determination of the unitary evolution of the quantum system entangled with its macroscopic environment .",
    "averaging over the environmental degrees of freedom in order to render this task manageable implies the loss of information on the presence of cat states if standard tools ( e.g. , density matrices ) are used .",
    "however , going over to higher - order wave function correlators the question on the appearance of cat states can be decided ; the possibility to investigate the reservoir - induced collapse paves the way for the further analysis of the consistency of the r from u scheme .",
