    "on the other hand , consider that the system is in the isotropic phase in the absence of a magnetic field , but close to the nematic instability [ see e.g. points ( h ) and ( j ) in fig . [ fig : phasediagram2d_1h ] ] .",
    "as the magnetic field is turned on , parallel nematic order develops in either the up or the down spin species , while the fermi surface of the other spin species stays isotropic .",
    "then the longitudinal conductivity and the magnetization show clear indications of the isotropic - parallel nematic transition . while the preferred direction of the fermi surface elongation in the presence of the symmetry breaking field",
    "depends on the details of the band structure and the chemical potential , a difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is clearly visible in ( h ) and ( j ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : conmagsusc_hconmagsusc_iconmagsusc_j ] . considering the in - plane field along the @xmath4 direction , we find that the conductivity perpendicular to the field ( @xmath76 ) is higher near half - filling as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conmagsusc_hconmagsusc_iconmagsusc_j ] ( h ) .",
    "since the hall conductivity @xmath77 is much smaller than the longitudinal components , the resistivity is almost inversely proportional to the conductivity .",
    "thus the resistivity parallel to the field direction is higher than that perpendicular to the field direction in panel ( h ) , which is consistent with the observed anisotropy in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite",
    "motivated by the recent experiment on the bilayer ruthenate@xcite , we address the following question : can one explain the magnetoresistive anisotropy within the nematic order scenario which successfully describes both the metamagnetic transitions and the large residual resistivity @xcite ? to understand the motivation of our study , one needs to recognize that the formation of nematic order in a single layer is insensitive to the direction of the magnetic field , and thus at first glance , the nematic theory can not account for all the existing phenomena .",
    "however , here we show that the recently discovered magnetoresistive anisotropy can be explained within the picture of nematic order when the bilayer coupling is taken into account .",
    "it is essential to note that the in - plane magnetic field leads to a relative momentum mismatch between the layers through bilayer coupling .",
    "when the field is along one of the in - plane crystal axes , it breaks the @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry .",

    "while the nematic phase always breaks the @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry in the single layer system , we find that there is another route to form a different nematic phase called the hidden nematic phase where the @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry is preserved .",
    "the hidden nematic and the isotropic phase are separated by a second order phase transition . while the @xmath4-@xmath5 anisotropy is absent in both phases ,",
    "the relative rotational symmetry between the layers is broken in the hidden nematic phase .",
    "the effect of the in - plane field is rather straightforward when one recognizes the importance of the bilayer structure in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 . as discussed above ,",
    "since the in - plane field is an @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry breaking field , there is no spontaneously broken @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that the two - fold degeneracy is no longer present , and domains can not be formed under the same mechanism as described in ref . :",
    "one of the fermi surface elongations is energetically preferred over the other for any small amount of in - plane field .",
    "thus the system recovers the intrinsic anisotropy , unless it is in the hidden nematic phase .",
    "based on the analysis of longitudinal conductivities and magnetic susceptibilities , we propose that sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is close to the parallel nematic instability in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "one may question the validity of the mean field theory adopted in the current paper , since it is widely accepted that sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is a strongly correlated material with a putative quantum critical point .",
    "it is true that a mean field theory breaks down close to a quantum critical point due to large fluctuations , and it is plausible that large fluctuations are important to determine an effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , one should note that we attempt to describe the ordered state and its first order transition to the isotropic phase .",
    "since a mean field theory works quite well deep inside an ordered state due to negligible fluctuations , and the effects of fluctuation on a first order transition are not as important as for a second order transition , we argue that the mean field theory with nematic order qualitatively captures the phenomena discussed above .",
    "there are strong indications that a magnetic field tuned nematic phase bounded by isotropic regions exists in the bilayer ruthenate .",
    "in addition to the phenomena discussed above , a recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment under a @xmath3 axis field revealed the splitting of singularities in the local dos across the metamagnetic transition.@xcite however , further experiments to detect a direct fermi surface anisotropy , such as scanning tunneling microscopy under in - plane magnetic fields , are highly desirable.@xcite a microscopic mechanism for the formation of a nematic phase beyond the effective model hamiltonian@xcite , and the effects of disorder in relation to a putative quantum critical point are also important subjects for theoretical studies which we will address in the future .",
