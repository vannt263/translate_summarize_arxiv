    "it is often considered that the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the consequent accretion of gas by the central protostar are driven by turbulent viscosity due to a magneto - rotational - instability ( mri ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite carried out fluid dynamical simulations of mri and found that the random torques due to the turbulent density fluctuations give rise to a random walk in semimajor axes of planetesimals .",
    "@xcite pointed out through model calculations that the random walk expands the effective feeding zone of protoplanets , and may lead to rapid formation of large cores for gas giants . through a fokker - planck treatment , @xcite also pointed out the importance of the random walk in planet accretion . adopting the semi - analytical formula for the random torque derived by @xcite , @xcite performed n - body simulations for the late stages of terrestrial planet accretion with a disk significantly depleted in gas , starting from mars - mass protoplanets .",
    "they found that the mri turbulence indeed helps to reduce the number of accreted terrestrial planets which is otherwise too large compared to our solar system .",

    "@xcite also found a similar feature in a self - gravitating disk .",
    "while the random walk itself is favorable to the growth of protoplanets by avoiding isolation , the excitation of their eccentricities , which had been neglected in @xcite and @xcite , is a threat for planetesimal accretion processes because of increased collision velocity .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite s orbital integrations were limited to 100150 keplerian times and neglected collision processes , so that it is not possible to conclude from that work whether planetesimals should grow or be eroded in the presence of turbulence .    in the present article",
    ", we explore by which paths planetesimals may have grown to planet - sized bodies in turbulent disks . because the level of density fluctuations due to the mri turbulence is not well determined , we choose to study the qualitative effects of the turbulence on the accretion of planetesimals and their dependence on the key parameters of the problem , in particular the progressive removal of the gas disk . in  2 , we summarize the conditions for the accretion and destruction of planetesimals in terms of their orbital eccentricities . in  3 , we analytically derive the equilibrium eccentricity for which the excitation due to turbulence is balanced by damping due to tidal interactions with the disk gas , aerodynamic gas drag , and collisions . comparing the equilibrium eccentricities with critical eccentricities for accretion and destruction",

    "we now put these various critical physical radii in the context of the evolution of the protoplanetary disk . in order to investigate the effect of departures from power - law relations of the surface density and temperature profiles in real disks , we also present in this section results obtained from a 1d disk model that includes an @xmath88-viscosity and photoevaporation ( see * ? ? ?",

    "however , after some point , the disk becomes too light to provide a sufficient amount of gas to form jupiter - mass gas giants .",

    "these are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical expressions derived in the previous section , with small differences arising from the simplifications inherent to the analytical approach .",
    "larger differences are found between the power - law disk and the @xmath88-disk models mostly because of the difference in slopes ( @xmath155 for the former , @xmath156 for the @xmath88-disk ) which implies that a given disk mass does not correspond to the same surface density with two models , the difference being larger at smaller orbital distances .",
    "however , the qualitative features of accretive and erosive regions are similar to each other . it should be noted that the models also differ in their temperature profiles , but this is found to be less important .    in the highly turbulent regime presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : accrete_gam1d-2 ] , a self - sustained regime of accretion becomes possible only when planetesimals have become very large / massive , with sizes generally well over 100 km .",
    "this case also yields a sustained area of high erosion where the average kinetic energies of planetesimals are above their internal energies .",
    "it is difficult to imagine how planetary cores can form in this context especially if they have to grow large enough to form giant planets .    with smaller perturbations from the turbulent disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : accrete ] ) , planetesimals have more possibilities to accrete : with time , as the disk mass decreases , the inner disk rapidly moves out of the highly erosive regime , while erosion still remains important at large orbital distances . with a turbulence strength parameter @xmath157 , corresponding to a very weak turbulence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : accrete_gam1d-4 ] ) , the presence of a highly erosive regime centered around @xmath0 m planetesimals is limited only to the outer regions ( @xmath158 au ) , and the zone rapidly shrinks as the circumstellar gaseous disk disappears .    in order to put these findings into context , we also show the mass of the disk when jupiter is believed to have started accreting its gaseous envelope .",
    "these values are calculated by assuming that the planet growth has been limited mostly by viscous diffusion in the disk , with the protoplanet capturing between 10% and 70% of the mass flux at its orbital distance in the disk evolution model by @xcite ( for details , see * ? ? ?",

    "such large planetesimals may be consistent with the size distribution of asteroids ( morbidelli et al .",
    "even if the first - born planetesimals are not as large , a small fraction of them could continue to grow larger than @xmath143 by accreting smaller bodies , because accretion is not completely cut off as soon as @xmath167 ( there is always a small possibility for accretion ) and the large planetesimals would not be disrupted by smaller ones .",
    "this possibility , however , must be examined by a more detailed growth model taking into account the effect of fragmentation and the size distribution of planetesimals , which we neglected in this paper .    concerning point 2 ,",
    "we have shown that planetesimals are most fragile at early times , in massive disks , and at large orbital distances .",
    "we therefore suggest that the growth towards planet sizes may be delayed due to mri turbulence , and then proceed from inside out : planetesimals should start accretion first close to the star , then progressively at larger orbital distances , as the gas surface density declines .",
    "the possibility to delay planet formation while keeping non - migrating km - size planetesimals is noteworthy because it would help planetary systems resisting to type - i migration : they would grow in a gas disk that is less dense , and for which migration timescales may be considerably increased .",

    "this `` late formation '' scenario is consistent with the noble gas enrichment in jupiter @xcite .",
    "however , in order to form gas giants , core accretion and gas accretion onto the cores must proceed fast enough to capture jupiter - mass amount of gas from the decaying gas disk .",
    "once the size of the largest planetesimals exceeds @xmath1 km , their eccentricities are damped by tidal drag and dynamical friction from small bodies .",
    "most of the other small bodies may be ground into sizes smaller than 1 km and their eccentricities could be kept very small by gas drag and collision damping . this could facilitate the runaway accretion of cores to become large enough ( @xmath168 ) for the onset of runaway gas accretion .",
    "this issue also has to be addressed by a detailed planetesimal growth model taking into account a size distribution .",
    "the likelihood of relatively rapid gas accretion without long `` phase 2 '' is discussed by @xcite .",
    "if planetesimal sizes are relatively small , gas drag damping opens up a gap in the planetesimal disk around the orbit of a core and truncates planetesimal accretion onto the core .",
    "the truncation of heating due to planetesimal bombardment enables the core to efficiently accrete disk gas .",
    "concerning point 3 , the mri inactive region ( `` dead zones '' ) may exist in inner disk regions in which the surface density is large enough to prevent cosmic and x rays from penetrating the disk @xcite .",
    "the preservation of a dead zone can also contribute to stall type - i migration by converting it to type - ii migration @xcite or by creating a local region with a positive radial gradient of disk pressure near the ice line @xcite .",

    "the last effect comes form the fact that small dust grains are the most efficient agents for charge recombination . according to grain growth ,",
    "the ionization of the disk and its coupling with the magnetic field become stronger to activate mri turbulence .",
    "we remark that if mri turbulence is activated , collisions are disruptive and they re - produces small grains to decrease the ionization degree .",
    "this self - regulation process might maintain a marginally dead state and keep producing small dust grains .",
    "this might be related with relative chronological age difference ( @xmath96myr ) between chondrules and cais ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . whether dead zones exist or not is one of the biggest issues in evolution of protoplanetary disks and planet formation",
    "a more detailed analysis of planetesimal accretion in turbulent disks could impose a constraint on this issue .    at large orbital distances ( 10 s of au )",

    "it shows that the entire mass of solids is highly reprocessed by collisions , in qualitative agreement with the paucity of presolar grains ( intact remnants from the molecular cloud core ) found in meteorites .",
    "it also prevents the growth of large planetesimals and helps to maintain a large population of small grains in the disks .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with observations that do not indicate a significant depletion of micron - sized grains with time , contrary to what would be predicted in the absence of turbulence @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the existence of mri turbulence may be a threat to planetesimal accretion .",
    "given the uncertainties related to these explanations , we can not provide a definitive scenario for the formation of protoplanetary cores .",
    "however , it offers several promising hints to explain important features of planet formation as constrained by today s observations of protoplanetary disks , exoplanets and meteoritic samples in the solar system .",
