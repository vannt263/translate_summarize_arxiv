    "the world wide power grid can be considered one of the greatest masterpiece of engineering that human being has ever made . moreover , starting from the first industrial revolution , smart grids ( sgs ) are one of the most important breakthrough that science and engineering fields are carrying out .",
    "currently , the smart grid concept is founded on a paradigmatic revolution that will permeate many aspects of human life . from the power system point of view",
    ", sgs can be considered as a way to transform the electric energy infrastructures from a centralized , producer - controlled network , into a distributed and consumer - interactive system , leveraging the same concepts and technologies that enabled the emergence and spread of the internet .",
    "sgs vision promises a power grid infrastructure with increased automation of the grid operations and  self - healing  capabilities .",
    "sgs integrate the renewable energy production , seamlessly balancing energy supply and demand , and can be considered as a key technology for facilitating the spread of electric mobility . to achieve that vision",
    ", the current power grid has to be thought as a _ technological ecosystem _ that needs a strong _ injection _ of distributed intelligence @xcite .",
    "g. k. venayagamoorthy argues that the current power grid can be considered a spatially and temporally complex , nonlinear and non - stationary system with a lot of uncertainties @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the sg can be examined for all intents and purposes as a complex system , and computational intelligence ( ci ) and soft computing ( sc ) techniques @xcite , are widely adopted to face a plethora of applications and problems arising in the sg context .",
    "the main ci paradigms for sg related problem solutions are : neuro - fuzzy , neuro - swarm , fuzzy - pso , fuzzy - ga , neuro - genetic @xcite .",
    "in fact , in mg related tasks , such as control and flow management , the presence of uncertainty and non - linearity , for example in the power demand profile of a large amount of users or in the power produced by solar or wind sources , makes related problems extremely challenging .",
    "hence , sc techniques can help managing the complexity of problems offering reliable solutions , especially in presence of non - linearity @xcite and in presence of storage devices that increase the solution space of the unit commitment problem @xcite .",
    "consequently , since linear techniques can not be considered adequate in solving problems whose nature is nonlinear and even stochastic , sc techniques offer a suitable framework introducing learning capabilities in the design of the mg controllers , especially in presence of renewable energy sources and storage .",
    "the current research follows our previous work @xcite about an application of what we call classic fuzzy - ga paradigm to the problem of flow control optimization in a microgrid ( mg ) .",
    "the mg can be thought as a sub - network of the sg characterized by the presence of autonomous ( often renewable ) energy sources buffered by some type of battery energy storage system ( bess ) and locally controlled in order to achieve smart energy flows management .",
    "the flow control task is carried out by a flc with two fuzzy inference systems ( fiss ) of mamdani type .",
    "fiss , relaying on approximated reasoning based on fuzzy logic ( fl ) , are in charge to optimize energy flows and the overall accounting profit in energy trading operations with the main - grid .",
    "the choice of mamdani type fis is related to its simplicity in incorporating human knowledge in the rb .",
    "specifically , in the application at hand the computational overhead introduced by the defuzzification process ( absent in a sugeno type fis ) is not a real problem .",
    "furthermore , the hga paradigm with its suitable coding scheme is well suited to optimize the structure of a mandani fis .",
    "the current work is focused on two main objectives : @xmath0 improve the mg model , in particular the bess model , @xmath1 optimize the rule base ( rb ) of the flc adopted to control power flows in the mg . as concerns the first goal we move on from an ideal battery adopted in @xcite designing an energy storage device based on a real - world model with suitable efficiency parameters . for the second objective",
    ", we designed an optimization method based on a suited genetic algorithm ( ga ) that is in charge of learning the fis parameters , optimizing at the same time both the economic return in energy trading and the cardinality of the fuzzy rb .",
    "the adopted optimization algorithm is known as hierarchical genetic algorithm ( hga ) aiming to perform at the same time a fine tuning of the fuzzy membership functions ( mfs ) and the structural optimization of the fiss  in the following we will refer on this paradigm as `` fuzzy - hga paradigm '' .",
    "in fact , while in our previous work the fis structure is constrained to be fixed , with a predefined number of antecedent and consequent terms and , thereby , with an immutable number of fuzzy rules , the adopted hga scheme allows to relax these constraints . moreover , the standard ga approach deals with a chromosome of fixed length whose encoding scheme leads to a lower flexibility in the rb tuning .",
    "a ga algorithm able to emulate a variable length chromosome with a suitable encoding scheme of the fis is ideal for optimizing the number of rules in the given rb .",
    "finally , the fuzzy rule optimization can lead to an improved performance of the fis , discarding pre - defined low performing rules .",
    "the idea behind hgas is based on the biological inspired gene structure of a chromosome formed in a hierarchical fashion , emulating the encoding approach of the deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) . in nature",
    "the genes can be classified into two different types : regulatory sequences and structural genes .",
    "one of the regulatory sequences found in dna is called the  promoter \" with the task of activating or deactivating structural genes",
    ". therefore the presence of active and inactive genes in the structural genes leads to the idea of a hierarchical structure formulation of the chromosome that consists of _ control genes _ and _ parametric genes_. the activation of the parametric genes is governed by the value of the control genes .",
    "accordingly , the strategy suggested by nature can be modeled for solving a number of engineering problems , such as those involving mix integer programming methods @xcite or fuzzy control applications demanding the joint optimization of both fiss parameters and rbs @xcite . in the last case",
    "the novelty of a hierarchical coding scheme is based on the definition of suitable genetic operators moving from standard ga algorithms to more advanced ones .",
    "the hierarchical encoding scheme allows to code the fiss parameters , more precisely mf parameters , as parametric genes and , at the same time , control genes can be used to activate and deactivate mfs composing a given fuzzy rb , thus tuning the overall number of fuzzy rules .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",

    "in the sc field , fl is a well consolidated discipline able to integrate approximate reasoning methodologies in engineering systems .",
    "sc techniques are commonly adopted in applications dealing with uncertainties @xcite .",
    "an interesting review on fuzzy logic and its hybrid approaches employed in the smart grids and microgrids context can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a small - scale mg designed to provide power to local communities , able to connect or disconnect from the main - grid , is studied .",
    "the control scheme is based on a non optimized flc considering as input the electricity prices , the renewable production , and the load demand .",
    "the rb is developed in order to ensure reliable grid operations taking into account the financial aspect to decide the load modification s level .",
    "flcs can be designed to control the amount of power that should be taken from the battery system in case of power deficiency to cover the load demand in a scheduling process @xcite .",
    "the latter problem is faced in @xcite , optimizing distribution system operations in a sg , from cost and system stability points of view . in",
    "the adopted mg model the flc was used only in the case when the instantaneous load demanded is higher than the instantaneous available power from renewable energy sources and the system is not at the peak period ( the battery is operated in discharge mode ) .",
    "however the flc does not foresee any further optimization . in @xcite",
    "is exploited a flc in a mg energy management system ( ems ) equipped by a bess in order to apply peak shaving and valley filling and to limit the oscillation of energy exchanged with the network buffering the ess .",
    "the flc aims to reduce the variation of the energy exchanged with the grid .",
    "moreover , it exploits a low bandwidth filter set before the flc .",
    "the flc is also optimized , but the adopted algorithm is not specified .",
    "in @xcite it has been considered a mg grid - connected equipped with a battery and a fuel cell .",
    "the mg consists of a wind turbine , a pv plant and a micro - turbine ; the ems must satisfy the load demand . in this work ,",
    "the considered objective functions to be minimized are the energy expenses and the emissions of a mg , through multi - objective optimization .",
    "the proposed ems approach consists in the joint formulation of multi - objective optimization approach based on linear programming and battery scheduling ( working both on - line ) .",
    "the battery scheduling , as a part of an optimal online energy management , is made through a flc designed by an expert operator for the on - line scheduling of the bess .",
    "it defines whether the battery should be charged or discharged and at which convenient rates .",
    "one of the flc input is the predicted energy in the day ahead both for the load and the generation .",
    "after the scheduling of the bess , the remainder of the power flows are optimized with a multi objective linear programming algorithm . in the mg modeling field",
    "a fl - based framework is proposed in @xcite aimed at controlling a bess to achieve an high efficient management .",
    "authors propose a mg model able to operate synchronously with the main - grid ( grid connected mode ) or independently ( islanded mode ) aiming to control the amount of power delivered to / taken from the storage unit in order to improve a cost function based on purchasing / selling power to the main - grid .",
    "predetermined human reasoning - based fuzzy rules are adopted to define a flc with inputs variables such as consumer s load demand , electricity price rate and renewable energy generation rate .",
    "specifically , data are sampled every 15 minutes and the evaluated figure of merit consists of the summation of payments / revenues ( similarly to the current work ) along with system losses . however , the fuzzy rb is kept fixed , thereby any subsequent learning and optimization procedure is not considered .",
    "it is well known that fl , especially in flc of mamdani type , is well - suited in incorporating human knowledge in artificial systems .",
    "however , the synthesis of the fuzzy rules in a complex control problem can be a challenging task and in presence of many free parameters in the rb the human expertise is not sufficient to assure satisfying performances .",
    "thereby , the fuzzy - ga modeling can help to improve the inherent human approximation level in generating fuzzy rules .",
    "furthermore , an evolutionary strategy can fill the gap between a fixed rb and a flexible one introducing a suitable learning scheme .",
    "thereby , an hga is able to tackle the problem of managing many free parameters of a mamdani fis , optimizing at the same time the number of rules and selecting the ones that perform better in terms of the considered objective function . in @xcite ,",
    "the fuzzy - ga approach is adopted for controlling energy flows and for managing the mg , in presence of an electric storage unit and distributed renewable energy generation .",
    "the main goal consists in optimizing a cost function defined as the net expense in electric energy purchasing from the main - grid . in @xcite authors",
    "propose , within the fuzzy - ga paradigm , an algorithm for optimizing the mg operations .",
    "in particular given the load demand , the wind power generation and day - ahead electricity prices , the algorithm is able to set up a mg generation schedule and to synthesize a suitable fuzzy expert system for allocating the energy from the storage system .",
    "moreover , two gas are used alternatively , one to determine both the microgrid scheduling and the fuzzy rules , the other to tune the mfs .",
    "the proposed expert system , responsible for setting the power withdrawn from the battery , is provided with learning capabilities so that it can optimize its knowledge base ( fuzzy rules and mfs ) according to the given scenario .",
    "a fl - based energy management , adopting a fixed mamdani fis , is studied in @xcite for house consumption applications in presence of a solar source .",
    "the main aim here is maximizing the use of solar energy and reducing the impact on the power grid , while satisfying the energy demand of house appliances , giving a fixed level of comfort .",
    "the proposed approach concerns a control scheme relating to energy flows of a mg belonging to an energy district  see fig [ fig : energy_district ]  and connected to the main - grid or even other mgs .",
    "the mg can perform its operations in a  grid connected mode \" and in  islanded mode \" . in the proposed model the energy production is typically provided by renewable distributed resources ( drs ) such as solar , wind , and micro - hydro generators .",
    "in addition , the mg can be equipped with a traditional energy source , such as a turbogas generator . moreover ,",
    "the mg is provided by a li - ion bess ; the model is compliant with technical specifications of a specific toshiba device .",
    "the bess is controlled through a battery management system ( bms ) and can be used to compensate the lack of energy production when drs are unable to meet domestic demand or to accumulate energy in case of overproduction .",
    "the bms can be programmed also to store energy that can be resold to the main - grid when favorable economic conditions apply ( based , for example , on energy price signals ) .",
    "the main scenarios , in which the proposed controller can act , are :    * the energy production within the mg meets ( or exceed ) the energy demand ; * the energy production within the mg does not meet the demand .    in the former case the mg operates in  islanded mode \" and",
    "the bess can be used to store a fraction of the surplus of energy , selling the remainder to the main - grid . in the latter case",
    "the mg can operate in  grid connected mode \" and can satisfy the loads by drawing a fraction of the negative energy balance from the bess , while buying the remainder from the main - grid .",
    "the two main operations introduced above depend strictly on the mg internal state that includes the state of charge ( soc ) of the bess and thus the available stored energy , the current price of energy and the generated and demanded power .",
    "it is noted that the two main objectives of the proposed controller are :    * to guarantee the continuous to power supplies of energy availability without interruptions .",
    "thus the mg must guarantee an high quality of service . * to maximize the accounting profit for possible energy trading with the main - grid or other mgs , given the collected information about the energy price and the mg internal state .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_c_scheme ] is depicted the simplified control scheme for a given mg .",
    "the controller is immersed in an external environment where information is assumed to be originated from a centralized data - center or directly from other connected mgs , in an automatic cooperative / competitive trading scenario .",
    "input information to the controller are the aggregated energy time profile requested from the mg loads , the aggregated energy time profile produced by the drs , the energy price signal coming from the main - grid and the soc of the bess .",
    "the output of the controller is a pair of signals towards the main - grid or the bess .",
    "the decision making module adopts a fuzzy inference scheme , implementing two distinct fiss for deciding the best actions trying to maximize the accounting profit of the mg in a given time span .",
    "a hierarchical genetic algorithm is adopted to tune the set of fuzzy rules and their parameters and thus to learn their best combination exploiting a given suitable objective function .",
    "the entire control chain in a general microgrid can be considered as organized as a three level system : the field level ( data acquisition and decentralized control ) , the scada level ( supervision and control functions ) , and the planning and management level , which can be a decentralized ems @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the third level .",
    "thereby , the model that we will discuss is based on a number of hypothesis that define the level of abstraction useful to correctly place the problem under analysis .",
    "the main assumptions are reported below .    *",
    "the considered timestamps are discretized and monospaced .",
    "* the present study does not consider low level operations such as voltage and reactive power control .",
    "* only high level operations are evaluated , such as the control of energy flow within a mg . * in the simulation several energy prosumers are contemplated , each one has its own characteristic energy profile with a timing defined each quarter of an hour . * for each time sample the flow control system takes into account the aggregate energy production and demand .",
    "* in each time sample the control system is able to fulfill a decision making request . *",
    "the demanded energy is actually consumed . *",
    "the main - grid has an unlimited energy capacity . * the current version of the mg flow control system deals with a single bess , as an overall model of the total storage capacity within the mg ( possibly due to more than one distinct devices ) . *",
    "the current work does not cover data exchange models within the main - grid and it is supposed that the mg is equipped with a suitable data network infrastructure with low delay and high qos in exchanging data packets .    hence , the adopted controller focus on the energy exchanges between portions of the mg and the main - grid considered fairly of unlimited capacity given the powers involved in small - scale mgs , as the one herein considered .",
    "furthermore a discrete data model for the measured power consumed and demanded is used with a sample time of 15 minutes , as adopted in most high level control schemes .",
    "the last assumption , about the low delay in data exchange , is reliable considering both the low delays characterizing communication protocols used in modern sgs and the small extension of the adopted mg model .",
    "for instance , cellular wireless networks such as gprs , umts , or 4 g technologies like 802.16 m and lte could be used for the interface between smart meters and the central system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , multiple communication technologies and standards could coexist in different parts of the smart grid , especially in a multi - microgrid context , and their impact deserves a deep investigation of communication devices and channel networks .      in general , given a mg like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_district ] , thus consisting of several energy generators and loads , the aggregate electricity production can be defined as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electrical power produced by the @xmath4-the producer within a set of @xmath5 producers , at time sample @xmath6 .",
    "+ similarly , we can define the aggregate electrical power demand within the given mg : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the amount of the demanded electricity effectively consumed by the @xmath9-th user within a set of @xmath10 consumers , at time sample @xmath6 .",
    "the mg is equipped with a bess , whose detailed model will be provided in sec . [",
    "sec : bm ] below .",
    "hence , at the abstraction level of the controller , the electricity storage can be characterized by the soc variable , defined as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the lower and the maximum threshold values for the soc , respectively . in other words ,",
    "these values constitute the interval of admissibility for the charge level of the battery unit . + considering both the aggregate demand time profile ( [ eq : prod_agg ] ) and the aggregate production time profile ( [ eq : cons_agg ] ) within the given mg",
    ", the power balance can be defined as : @xmath14 finally , we will denote with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the price signals in buying and selling energy from / to the main - grid , respectively .",
    "the mg state at time sample @xmath6 , from the point of view of the controller , depends on the energy balance , the energy price signals and the state of charge ( soc ) of the storage unit . therefore , it is possible to define a generic mg state as : @xmath17 the energy balance value ( [ eq : bal ] ) defines three distinct sub - states in which the mg can be found , namely :    1 .   if @xmath18 , the mg has a deficit of energy ( underproduction state ) ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath19 , the produced energy fulfills the internal demand ( equilibrium state ) ; 3 .   if @xmath20 , the mg has a surplus of energy ( overproduction state ) .",
    "for each given sub - state we can have the following contingencies for the storage unit :    1 .   if @xmath21 , the available charge has a null value ; 2 .   if @xmath22 , the charge has a maximum value ; 3 .",
    "if @xmath23 , the available charge has an intermediate value .",
    "the above reported fine grained classification leads to define a set of control actions taking into account also the energy price signals .",
    "the inference process underlying the controller is performed by a set of control actions dispatched to actuators .",
    "the control actions depend on the mg state @xmath24 .",
    "it is noted that , in the following , the term  _ crisp _ \"",
    "@xcite relies to the distinction made in fl among _ crisp _ sets , that are ordinary sets and fuzzy sets defined by a mf , as it will discussed in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : fuzzy_c_mg ] .",
    "the set of control actions is defined as : @xmath25 hence , for the generic action we have : @xmath26 in addition , the set of actions just defined can be split in two disjoint subsets :    1 .   ",

    "the disambiguation task about these cases is performed by a suitable module ",
    "[ fig : fd ]  able to evaluate the mg state @xmath24 , in charge of selecting the activation of the crisp decision making procedure or the fuzzy one .",

    "it is noted that the unitary value for both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 control parameters leads to actions that overlaps with the set of  crisp \" actions . however",

    "the second subset of control actions refers to the energy exchanges with the energy storage device , that at the abstraction level of the controller , is governed with the following dynamical equation regarding the soc @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the signed quantity of charge exchanged with the mg , as required at each time step by the flc .",
    "given the purchasing and selling price signals and the energy exchanged with the main grid [ eq : pout ] , it follows that the economical balance of the mg is : @xmath35 the last equation is the accounting profit ( or the accounting loss , depending on the sign of the first term of ( [ eq : profit ] ) for each time sample and it is the difference between the revenues and the expenses arising from the energy trading . in eq .",

    "the bess model is enriched with physical real - world characteristics regarding battery devices currently used in battery - to - grid applications .",

    "as concerns the constraints for the weights of the fuzzy rules , @xmath80 , each one is allowed to range in @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "once we define the constraints , the initial values for each allele can be generated through the extraction of a uniformly distributed random variable within the interval constraints .",
    "for the control genes , as binary strings , the domain of the random variables is the binary valued set @xmath81 and the random extraction process assigns equal probability to the two possible values .",
    "the chromosome representation given in ( [ pbin - preal ] ) is based on the distinction between the control genes and the parametric genes .",
    "this separation leads to an heavy simplification of the design process for the genetic operators .",
    "it is well - known that the crossover operator is an important genetic operator that can effectively exchange and recombine genetic material from two selected parents .",
    "the hierarchical scheme allows to a semantic separation of the genetic material leading to design a mixed crossover operator consisting of a specific simple operator for control genes and a suitable operator for the parametric genes .",

    "the mutation operator is crucial for the exploration capability of the overall optimization algorithm , allowing a suitable variability in the population .",
    "more specifically , the mutation operator is designed to change one or more genes depending on a suitable mutation rate used as threshold for a given probability value for the mutation of each allele . even for the mutation operator",
    "it is adopted a mixed scheme : +    * for the binary section @xmath82 of the chromosome it is applied a single point mutation operator in which the mutation point is chosen randomly .",
    "+ * for the real - valued section @xmath83 of the chromosome the  non - uniform \" mutation operator is performed .",
    "the genetic operator takes into account the age of the given population in a way that the mutation effect vanishes with the progression of the generations .",
    "more specifically , given a chromosome @xmath83 for a selected gene @xmath91 , the resulting offspring gene is generated choosing randomly among the following relations @xcite : + + @xmath92 + where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are , respectively , the upper and lower bounds for @xmath91 , @xmath95 $ ] is a random uniformly distributed real value , _ g _ is the current generation index and _ g _ the predefined maximum number of generations .",
    "finally , @xmath96 is a parameter determining the decay speed .",
    "we remark that the main difference between the two evolutionary approaches , namely classic fuzzy - ga and fuzzy - hga , lies in a higher number of degrees of freedom available for the fis optimization .",
    "in fact , a composite encoding scheme capable of turning off / on each fuzzy set allows a more effective exploration of the search space . if we call @xmath97 the set of all fis@xmath98 depending on a set of structural parameters @xmath99 , where the subscript @xmath100 refer to the membership function parameters , the rule weights and the fuzzy rules , respectively , the fuzzy - hga scheme is able to explore a subset @xmath101 .",
    "borrowing the linear algebra jargon , the fuzzy - hga scheme can explore a subspace of the overall space which hosts the fiss .",
    "@xmath97 can contain fiss with poorly performing fuzzy rules that the ga could evaluate in order to optimize the objective function , lowering in this way the overall search efficiency .",
    "in fact , among a huge set of fuzzy rules , many of them can be useless ( for example because are centered onto input space regions corresponding to infrequent system states ) , or even harmful for the overall performances ( for example , if the parameters of the related membership functions are not well tuned ) .",
    "thus , according to the occam s razor criterion , a tuning procedure able to perform a reduction of the structural complexity of the rule base ( and thus of the fis ) is fundamental to improve the overall performances of the ems",

    "the control section , encoded as a binary string , controls the activation of the parametric section representing the mf parameters and the weights of fuzzy rules .",
    "the specific encoding scheme of the hga offers a higher flexibility in tuning the flc in comparison with the classic scheme which foresees a fixed and maximal number of rules due to the rigidity of the chromosome length .",
    "the proposed method for ems synthesis incorporates a learning step .",
    "in fact , once fis rules are optimized by considering training set data through an off - line procedure running on a plain workstation , the trained rules can be uploaded into an embedded system ( a microcontroller ) ready to work in real - time . from this point of view",
    ", the added complexity of the hga scheme can be well managed off - line by an inexpensive workstation ( such as an intel i7 6thh generation with 32 gb of ram ) , exploiting its power in evolving suitable rules without affecting the real time operations .",
    "note that the final aim of the hga algorithm is the reduction of the structural complexity of the rule base in the fis , dropping the number of rules and the number of antecedents in each rule .",
    "consequently , with respect to a fis resulting from a learning procedure based on a plain version of a genetic algorithm , the microcontroller is in charge to handle a lower number of rules in performing decision making , in a given time interval .",
    "moreover , note that the typical dynamics characterizing a microgrid ( at the considered abstraction level ) are slow enough to set the length of the time interval in the order of minutes ( 15 minutes , in the considered case ) .",
    "consequently , even an entry level and inexpensive microcontroller ( such as an `` arduino due '' board , based on the atmel sam3x8e arm cortex - m3 cpu ) has sufficient computational power to handle a great number of fuzzy rules in such time intervals .",
    "the fuzzy - hga paradigm is thereby evaluated for some configuration of the mg parameters , battery model parameters and genetic operator parameters with the aim to study the overall behavior of the fuzzy control system .",
    "a further comparison is performed between a classic optimization scheme within the fuzzy - ga paradigm and the adopted fuzzy - hga .",
    "the classic ga scheme foresees the optimization of the mf parameters together with the fuzzy rule weights in a fixed rule base ( rb ) whose cardinality is maximal ( grid partition ) .",
    "the fuzzy - hga algorithm outperforms the classic fuzzy - ga scheme by 67% .",
    "the hierarchical encoding method of the fis parameters and the definition of suited genetic operators explain the improvement in performance reached at the cost of a more complex design of the ga and of the encoding scheme .",
    "however , this additional computational cost at design and training stages is balanced with the possibility to obtain simpler flcs in terms of number of rules , allowing the real time implementation of the complete control system on low cost embedded electronic devices .",
    "results are encouraging and suggest to work in future developments on both mg modeling and learning .",
    "future developments foresee the definition of suitable measures , such as i ) the stress of the battery in charging and discharging processes , ii ) the stress of the main - grid in terms of undesired fast changes of power flow between the mg and the main - grid .",
    "these measures can be considered as additional objectives ( that are likely conflicting with the main one based on prosumer profit ) aiming at controlling both the stress of the storage system and that of the main - grid . a mono - objective or a muti - objective ga scheme",
    "can be adopted taking into account the possibility of tuning the fuzzy controller allowing different behaviors , such as promoting the auto - consumption , lowering the battery stress or the workload on the main - grid .",
    "furthermore , an interesting future scenario consists in performing a spatial granulation of the whole considered distribution network , where each territorial granule acts as a mg , each one able to exchange energy with other spatially close mgs and/or with the main - grid , with different pricing programs .",
    "the mgs can have different characteristics in terms of aggregate demand , production , energy source type and storage systems .",
    "moreover , to increase the model reliability , it is interesting to consider power losses in energy exchange between mgs .",
    "the intrinsic heterogeneity of mgs together with the loss factors and the learning features fulfilled within the fuzzy - hga paradigm allow to study the behavior of the mg acting as agents , with possible emerging cooperative behavior in satisfying objective functions defined by a higher level controller .",
    "hence , in this augmented scenario some of the initial assumption adopted through the model can be relaxed and the mgs can be equipped with a suitable model of telecommunication network , taking into account also the capacity constraints in data delivery .",
    "moreover the mg can foresee a demand composed of schedulable loads such as smart appliances and electric vehicles , allowing to design suitable demand response ( dr ) programs able to act together with the flc aiming to optimize predefined objectives . from the learning side , it is really interesting to apply other nature inspired methods such as autoimmune or bacterial optimization algorithms for the optimization of the flcs .",

    "<S> bio - inspired algorithms like genetic algorithms and fuzzy inference systems ( fis ) are nowadays widely adopted as hybrid techniques in commercial and industrial environment . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present an interesting application of the fuzzy - ga paradigm to smart grids . </S>",
    "<S> the main aim consists in performing decision making for power flow management tasks in the proposed microgrid model equipped by renewable sources and an energy storage system , taking into account the economical profit in energy trading with the main - grid . </S>",
    "<S> in particular this study focuses on the application of a hierarchical genetic algorithm ( hga ) for tuning the rule base ( rb ) of a fuzzy inference system ( fis ) , trying to discover a minimal fuzzy rules set in a fuzzy logic controller ( flc ) adopted to perform decision making in the microgrid . </S>",
    "<S> the hga rationale focuses on a particular encoding scheme , based on control genes and parametric genes applied to the optimization of the fis parameters , allowing to perform a reduction in the structural complexity of the rb . </S>",
    "<S> this approach will be referred in the following as fuzzy - hga . </S>",
    "<S> results are compared with a simpler approach based on a classic fuzzy - ga scheme , where both fis parameters and rule weights are tuned , while the number of fuzzy rules is fixed in advance . </S>",
    "<S> experiments shows how the fuzzy - hga approach adopted for the synthesis of the proposed controller outperforms the classic fuzzy - ga scheme , increasing the accounting profit by 67% in the considered energy trading problem yielding at the same time a simpler rb .    * </S>",
