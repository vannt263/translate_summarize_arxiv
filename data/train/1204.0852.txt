    "recent years have seen an increasing interest on networked strategic scenarios where agents may cooperate or compete with each other towards the achievement of some objective , interact across different layers , have access to limited information , and are subject to evolving interaction topologies .",
    "this paper is a contribution to this body of work .",
    "specifically , we consider a class of strategic scenarios in which two networks of agents are involved in a zero - sum game .",
    "we assume that the objective function can be decomposed as a sum of concave - convex functions and that the networks have opposing objectives regarding its optimization .",
    "agents collaborate with the neighbors in their own network and have partial information about the state of the agents in the other network .",
    "such scenarios are challenging because information is spread across the agents and possibly multiple layers , and networks , by themselves , are not the decision makers .",
    "our aim is to design a distributed coordination algorithm that can be used by the agents to converge to the nash equilibrium .",
    "note that , for a 2-player zero - sum game of the type considered here , a pure nash equilibrium corresponds to a saddle point of the objective function .",
    "_ literature review .",
    "_ multiple scenarios involving networked systems and intelligent adversaries in sensor networks , filtering , finance , and wireless communications  @xcite can be cast into the strategic framework described above . in such scenarios ,",
    "the network objective arises as a result of the aggregation of agent - to - agent adversarial interactions regarding a common goal , and information is naturally distributed among the agents .",
    "the present work has connections with the literature on distributed optimization and zero - sum games .",
    "the distributed optimization of a sum of convex functions has been intensively studied in recent years , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these works build on consensus - based dynamics  @xcite to find the solutions of the optimization problem in a variety of scenarios and are designed in discrete time .",
    "exceptions include  @xcite on continuous - time distributed optimization on undirected networks and  @xcite on directed networks .    regarding zero - sum games , the works  @xcite study the convergence of discrete - time subgradient dynamics to a saddle point .",
    "continuous - time best - response dynamics for zero - sum games converges to the set of nash equilibria for both convex - concave  @xcite and quasiconvex - quasiconcave  @xcite functions . under strict convexity - concavity assumptions ,",
    "continuous - time subgradient flow dynamics converges to a saddle point  @xcite .",
    "asymptotic convergence is also guaranteed when the hessian of the objective function is positive definite in one argument and the function is linear in the other  @xcite .",
    "the distributed computation of nash equilibria in noncooperative games , where all players are adversarial , has been investigated under different assumptions .",
    "the algorithm in  @xcite relies on all - to - all communication and does not require players to know each other s payoff functions ( which must be strongly convex ) . in  @xcite , players are unaware of their own payoff functions but have access to the payoff value of an action once it has been executed .",
    "these works design distributed strategies based on extremum seeking techniques to seek the set of nash equilibria .    _ statement of contributions .",
    "_ we introduce the problem of distributed convergence to nash equilibria for two networks engaged in a strategic scenario .",
    "the networks aim to either maximize or minimize a common objective function which can be written as a sum of concave - convex functions .",
    "individual agents collaborate with neighbors in their respective network and have partial knowledge of the state of the agents in the other one .",
    "our first contribution is the introduction of an aggregate objective function for each network which depends on the interaction topology through its laplacian and the characterization of a family of points with a saddle property for the pair of functions .",
    "we show the correspondence between these points and the nash equilibria of the overall game . when the graphs describing the interaction topologies within each network are undirected , the gradients of these aggregate objective functions are distributed . building on this observation ,",
    "our second contribution is the synthesis of a consensus - based saddle - point strategy for adversarial networks with undirected topologies .",
    "we show that the proposed dynamics is guaranteed to asymptotically converge to the nash equilibrium for the class of strictly concave - convex and locally lipschitz objective functions .",
    "our third contribution focuses on the directed case .",
    "we show that the transcription of the saddle - point dynamics to directed topologies fails to converge in general .",
    "this leads us to propose a generalization of the dynamics , for strongly connected weight - balanced topologies , that incorporates a design parameter .",
    "we show that , by appropriately choosing this parameter , the new dynamics asymptotically converges to the nash equilibrium for the class of strictly concave - convex differentiable objective functions with globally lipschitz gradients .",
    "the technical approach employs notions and results from algebraic graph theory , nonsmooth and convex analysis , set - valued dynamical systems , and game theory . as an intermediate result in our proof strategy for the directed case",
    ", we provide a generalization of the known characterization of cocoercivity of concave functions to concave - convex functions .",
    "the results of this paper can be understood as a generalization to competing networks of the results we obtained in  @xcite for distributed optimization .",
    "this generalization is nontrivial because the payoff functions associated to individual agents now also depend on information obtained from the opposing network .",
    "this feature gives rise to a hierarchy of saddle - point dynamics whose analysis is technically challenging and requires , among other things , a reformulation of the problem as a constrained zero - sum game , a careful understanding of the coupling between the dynamics of both networks , and the generalization of the notion of cocoercivity to concave - convex functions .",
