    "nucleus - nucleus collisions at relativistic energies have been intensely studied over the last two decades .",
    "the main goal of these efforts is to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of high energy and baryon densities when the creation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected @xcite .",
    "in fact , various collision characteristics and their collision energy dependence suggest that a transient state of deconfinement matter may be created at collision energies as low as 30 a gev @xcite",
    ". fluctuations in physical observables in heavy ion collisions have been a topic of interest for some years as they may provide important signals regarding the formation of qgp . with the large number of particles produced in heavy ion collisions at cern sps and bnl rhic energies",
    "it has now become feasible to study fluctuations on an event - by - event basis @xcite . in a thermodynamical picture of the strongly interacting system formed in the collision ,",
    "the fluctuations in particle multiplicities @xcite , mean transverse momenta @xcite , and other global observables , are related to the fundamental properties of the system , such the specific heat @xcite , chemical potential , and matter compressibility @xcite .",
    "these , in turn , may reveal information on the properties of the equation of state near the qcd phase boundary @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this work is to study how the multiplicity fluctuations change with increasing number of nucleons participating in the collision , i.e. with the system size . in view of this , centrality selected pb+pb collisions , central c+c and si+si collisions as well as inelastic p+p interactions at @xmath0  gev registered by na49 at the cern sps were analyzed and the results are presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : method ] the method of measuring multiplicity fluctuations is introduced and shortly discussed .",
    "the na49 set - up is presented in sec .",
    "[ s : experiment ] .",
    "experimental procedures , in particular event and particle selection , detector acceptance and centrality determination are discussed in sec .",

    "the results on the system size dependence of the multiplicity fluctuations are presented in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] . a final discussion and summary close the paper .",
    "let @xmath1 be the multiplicity distribution , then : @xmath2 is the mean value of the distribution .",
    "the variance of the multiplicity distribution is defined as : @xmath3 note , that for the poisonnian distribution the variance equals mean value , @xmath4 .",
    "mean value and variance of the multiplicity distributions are the only observables used for this analysis .",
    "in description of nuclear collision the concepts of participant and spectator nucleons are very useful .",
    "participant nucleons are nucleons which are removed by the interaction process from the fermi spheres of the target and projectile nuclei .",
    "the remaining nucleons are called spectators . in case of central nucleus - nucleus collisions , where the impact parameter @xmath5 is relatively small ,",
    "almost all nucleons participate in the collision . in particular",
    ", the number of projectile participants , @xmath6 approximately equals the total number of projectile nucleons : @xmath7 .",
    "if the collision is peripheral ( with large impact parameter @xmath5 ) almost all nucleons are spectators , @xmath8 . in general",
    ", the number of projectile spectators @xmath9 is given by : @xmath10 .",
    "widely used models of nuclear collisions are superposition models which assume that secondary particles are emitted by independent sources .",
    "the simplest example is the wounded nucleon model @xcite , in which the sources are wounded nucleons , i.e. the nucleons that have interacted within a glauber model approach . in this model",
    "the number of participants is equal to the number of wounded nucleons . in superposition models",
    "the total multiplicity is then given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes number of sources and @xmath13 describes the multiplicity from a single source .",
    "the mean total multiplicity in an event may be calculated as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean number of sources and @xmath16 is the mean multiplicity from a single source .",
    "the variance of the multiplicity distribution is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the variances of the distribution of multiplicity from a single source and the distribution of the number of sources , respectively .",
    "the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution @xmath20 is a useful measure of multiplicity fluctuations . from eqs .",
    "[ nsr ]  and  [ var ] one gets @xmath21 thus in superposition models the measured scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution is a sum of two components .",
    "the first one describes the multiplicity fluctuations from a single source while the second one accounts for the fluctuations of the number of sources . in most considerations , fluctuations of the geometry of the collision process , which in superposition models are given by the second term in eq .",
    "[ var ] , are uninteresting .",
    "the relevant fluctuations are fluctuations determined by the physics of the collision process , in superposition models given by the first component of eq .",
    "therefore , in this paper we try to remove the influence of the second component by the procedure described in sec .",

    "the experimental set - up of the na49 experiment with different beam definitions and target arrangements.,width=529 ]",
    "the na49 experiment is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer at the cern - sps used to study the hadronic final states produced in collisions of beam particles ( p , pb from the sps directly and c , si from the fragmentation of the primary pb beam ) with a variety of fixed targets .",
    "the main tracking devices are four large volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) ( fig .  [ setup ] ) which are capable of detecting 80% of some 1500 charged particles created in a central pb+pb collision at @xmath0  gev .",
    "two of them , the vertex tpcs ( vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 ) , are located in the magnetic field of two super - conducting dipole magnets ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 t , respectively ) and two others ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically to the beam line .",
    "the results presented here are analysed with a global tracking scheme @xcite , which combines track segments that belong to the same physical particle but were detected in different tpcs .",
    "the na49 tpcs allow precise measurements of particle momenta @xmath24 with a resolution of @xmath25 ( gev / c)@xmath26 .",
    "up is supplemented by two time of flight ( tof ) detector arrays and a set of calorimeters .",
    "the targets : c ( 561 mg/@xmath27 ) , si ( 1170 mg/@xmath27 ) discs and pb ( 224 mg/@xmath27 ) foils for ion collisions and a liquid hydrogen cylinder ( length 20 cm ) for elementary interactions are positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "pb beam particles are identified by means of their charge as seen by a helium gas - cherenkov counter ( s2 ) and p beam particles by a 2 mm scintillator ( s2 ) .",
    "both of them are situated in front of the target .",
    "the study of c+c and si+si reactions is possible through the generation of a secondary fragmentation beam which is produced by a primary target ( 1 cm carbon ) in the extracted pb - beam . with the beam line momentum set to @xmath28",

    "off - line clean - up is achieved by using in addition the energy loss measured by beam position detectors ( bpd-1/2/3 in fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "these detectors consist of pairs of proportional chambers and are placed along the beam line for a precise measurement of the transverse positions of the incoming pb nuclei .    for p ,",
    "c and si beams interactions in the target are selected by anti - coincidence of the incoming beam particle with a small scintillation counter ( s4 ) placed on the beam line between the two vertex magnets . for p+p interactions at @xmath0  gev",
    "this counter selects a ( trigger ) cross section of 28.5 mb out of 31.6 mb of the total inelastic cross section . for pb - ion beams ,",
    "an interaction trigger is provided by anti - coincidence with a helium gas - cherenkov counter ( s3 ) directly behind the target .",
    "the s3 counter is used to select minimum bias collisions by requiring a reduction of the cherenkov signal by a factor of about 6 .",
    "since the cherenkov signal is proportional to @xmath32 , this requirement ensures that the pb projectile has interacted with a minimal constraint on the type of interaction .",
    "this setup limits the triggers on non - target interactions to rare beam - gas collisions , the fraction of which proved to be small after cuts , even in the case of peripheral pb+pb collisions .",
    "centrality of the collisions is selected by using information from a veto calorimeter ( vcal ) , which measures the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the veto calorimeter is adjusted in order to cover the projectile spectator region by a proper setting of the collimator ( coll ) .",
