    "supernovae ( sne ) play a central role in galaxy evolution and cosmic metal production . measuring the rates at which sne explode is thus an important step for understanding the chemical evolution of the universe . in recent years",
    ", efforts have intensified to measure the low - redshift type ia sn rate both in field environments ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ; hardin et al . 2000 ; madgwick et al . 2003 ; blanc et al .",
    "2004 , botticella et al .",
    "2008 , dilday et al . 2008 ) and in galaxy clusters ( gal - yam et al . 2002 ; maoz & gal - yam 2004 ; sharon et al . 2007 ;",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "2008 ; graham et al . 2008 ; sand et al .",
    "however , due to small sn numbers , there are still significant uncertainties in low - redshift sn rates .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that a large archival repository of sne , one that is potentially useful for a low - redshift rate measurement using a large number of sne , exists in the data from the first phase of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "we use a small fraction of these data to detect and compile a sample of sne ia and to derive the sn ia rate at low - redshift .",
    "the techniques we use in this paper are also of relevance for future projects such as the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; kaiser 2004 ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; tyson 2002 ) .",
    "these projects will survey huge areas in a relatively short time , and will produce large samples of sne for which spectral classification will not be possible , due to their large numbers .    in  2",
    "we describe the sdss data we use .",
    "the pipeline used to process these data and detect sne is presented in  3 .",
    "detection efficiency and photometric calibration are discussed in sections @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    " @xmath8 presents our preliminary results , including a first sn sample , its classification , and a calculation of the sn ia rate .",
    "we compare our results to previous measurements in  7 , and summarize in  8 .",
    "the sdss imaged about one quarter of the sky in five bands ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , centered at 3551 , 4686  , 6165  , 7481  , 8931  ; fukugita et al .",
    "images were photometrically ( tucker et al .",
    "2006 ) and astrometrically ( pier 2003 ) calibrated by the sdss pipeline ( lupton et al .",
    "the data products of the sdss ( images and object catalogs ) were made available in a series of data releases ( see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 for a description of the latest data release , dr6 ) .    with the objective of covering the survey area once ,",
    "imaging was performed by scanning the sky in great circles .",
    "each scan was along a @xmath14-degree - wide strip , where each strip was divided into numerous `` fields '' .",
    "however , dividing the celestial sphere on to rectangular planes causes the rectangles to overlap , especially close to the poles of the survey scan coordinate system ( see e.g. fig .",
    "1 ) . in addition",
    ", adjacent strips have an intentional overlap for the purpose of photometric and astrometric quality checks .",
    "the fact that different strips were imaged at different times raises the possibility of using the overlap regions to detect transient events .",
    "each final sdss field is an image of @xmath15 pixels .",
    "the image pixel scale is @xmath16 with a median point spread function ( psf ) of @xmath17 in the @xmath11 band .",
    "an exposure time of @xmath18 sec was used to image all fields , resulting in point source ab magnitude @xmath19 repeatability limits of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in the @xmath22 bands , respectively .",
    "to deal with the vast amounts of data in the sdss database , we developed a largely automatic pipeline for downloading individual subsets of overlapping field images , and processing them one at a time .",
    "our pipeline consists of three independent modules for download , registration , and detection , executed in that order .    as a first step",
    ", we compiled a list of overlapping sdss fields .",
    "to do so , we downloaded the coordinates of all the fields in the sdss dr4 database . by applying a polygon intersection algorithm , which assumes planar geometry , to the list of coordinates",
    ", we constructed a list of the overlapping regions of each sdss field .",
    "each image set , consisting of a first - epoch image ( the `` reference '' epoch ) and its overlapping second epoch images , was individually downloaded for further processing by our pipeline . in the present paper ,",
    "we search for sne in the region @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this region is not far from the pole of the sdss coordinate system ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , resulting in a large overlap area of @xmath27 , obtained from @xmath28 of sdss images .",
    "our survey search method is based on image subtraction .",
    "we note that an alternative method is to search for sne in the sdss catalog using different criteria , e.g. , sn colors ( see poznanski et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , a sdss catalog sn search has some disadvantages .",
    "for example , a blind color search will be affected by color contamination originating from sn host galaxies .",
    "in addition , lacking a direct access to the sdss pipeline makes it difficult to estimate the survey detection efficiency function .",
    "we chose to limit our sn search to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands since they are the deepest bands in the sdss .",
    "furthermore , the scanning order of each field in the sdss is @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath11- and @xmath10-band exposures of the same field in a given scan have the largest time separation , i.e. , there is a @xmath30 minute difference between exposures of the same field in these bands .",
    "this time difference is critical for identifying and excluding solar - system objects from among the sn candidates .",
    "two computers were used for running our pipeline .",
    "one computer was used for continuous downloading of images from the sdss database . in parallel , the registration and detection modules ( see below ) were run on a computer with a pentium iv 3.4 ghz processor and 2 gb of memory .",
    "the download rate and the processing rate both dictated a net data flow rate of about 1 deg@xmath31 per day . in practice , software , hardware , and",
    "communications problems resulted in a lower rate , and guided our decision to stop the current search after about 90 deg@xmath31 .",
    "the registration module aligns the overlapping images in each set to their reference image and produces a difference image in which sn candidates are searched for by the detection module .",
    "both the @xmath10 and @xmath11 image sets , once downloaded , are registered separately by the registration module .",
    "an overlapping image is first registered to its reference image , based on their world coordinate system ( wcs ) coordinates , using the @xmath32 iraf ( tody 1986 ) task .",
    "the overlapping areas are then cut out from both the reference and registered images . using each field s photometric parameters , extracted from the sdss database , we next linearly",
    "match the background level and the zeropoint of the registered image to those of the reference image . at this point",
    ", we try to achieve a better image registration , which is crucial for image subtraction , by matching the positions of objects which appear in both images .",
    "we first detect objects in the overlapping image segments by applying the source extractor ( sextractor ) program ( bertin & arnout 1996 ) to both segments .",
    "next , by cross correlating the object positions , a more precise registration between the two segments is obtained using the @xmath33 and @xmath34 iraf tasks , allowing for offsets in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 axes and a rotation angle between the two images . in order to avoid poor statistics in the matching process",
    ", this latter alignment is performed only if there are at least seven matching objects . otherwise this stage is skipped .",
    "next , the image with the smaller psf full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is degraded by convolving it with a @xmath37 gaussian kernel , @xmath38 $ ] , in order to match the psf of the second image .",
    "the kernel is found from the parameters of the two image psfs , listed as `` psfwidth '' in the sdss catalogue `` field '' table .",
    "this simplistic psf matching approach is dictated by the small number of objects ( generally not point sources ) in the overlapping regions , which prevents the application of more sophisticated psf - matching algorithms ( e.g. alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) .",
    "following subtraction of two registered images , the absolute values of the difference image is formed , so that all residuals are positive . in order to smooth out residuals due to imperfect alignment",
    ", the difference image is smoothed by convolving it with a 2d gaussian , three pixels wide @xmath39 .",
    "the residuals are detected in the difference image by applying sextractor to the image .",
    "since the final difference image is positive definite ( see @xmath40 ) , it has a one sided noise distribution .",
    "we chose to apply a @xmath41 detection threshold in the detection process .",
    "the value of the detection threshold is calculated using the poisson fluctuations of the background counts in both the reference and registered images .",
    "the residuals detected by sextractor are automatically examined in more detail to screen for various non - sn detection contaminations , as described next .",
    "we first search for variable stars within our candidate list . using sextractor",
    ", we obtain a list of objects in both the registered and reference images .",
    "if an object is detected in both images at the same position where a residual was detected in the difference image , we query the sdss catalogue for objects at that position .",
    "if an object , catalogued as a star , exists at that position , the candidate is considered a variable star and is rejected from our candidate list .",
    "similarly , we reject candidates spectroscopically identified as quasars .",
    "we next explore the possibility that a residual is the result of poor image registration .",
    "we search , using sextractor , for positive residuals in two new difference images : the reference minus registered image , and vice versa .",
    "if in each of the two images a residual is detected near the position of a candidate , we compare the difference between the photon counts of the two residuals to our detection threshold .",
    "in contrast to our original detection in the absolute value of the difference image , we now require the photon count difference to have at least @xmath42 significance . in a final test for improper alignment ,",
    "a stamp of @xmath43 pixels around the position of each residual is cut out of the registered and reference images .",
    "the two image stamps are re - registered using the @xmath44 task in iraf , based on cross correlation . a new difference image is produced using the new re - registered images . if no residuals are detected in the new subtracted stamp image , the candidate is discarded .",
    "the remaining candidates are subjected to another test , aimed at determining whether or not they are moving objects .",
    "we first query the sdss catalogue to check if the target has been flagged as a moving object .",
    "we also compare the position of each candidate in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , assuming that it was detected in both bands .",
    "if the candidate position has changed by more than @xmath45 pixels , it is also considered a moving object and is excluded from the candidate list .",
    "all stages up to this point are performed automatically , with no human intervention .",
    "the remaining candidates are saved , together with their subtraction images , for visual inspection , performed by a single person ( ah ) .",
    "the inspection helps reject false positives of various types , such as artifacts and residuals due to poor psf matching , poor image alignment , cosmic rays , and saturated objects ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . about 99% of the candidates found by the automatic pipeline",
    "are discarded as false positives in the visual inspection stage .",
    "estimating the efficiency of our sn detection process is critical for deriving a reliable sn rate . we have planted a sample of fake sne in the sdss images , whose recovery fraction provides an estimate of the detection efficiency as a function of sn magnitude .    the first step in producing the fake sn sample was choosing the sn hosts .",
    "we compiled the @xmath10 magnitude and the photometric redshift ( csabai et al .",
    "2003 ; oyaizu et al .",
    "2008 ) of each galaxy in the overlapping sets of images from the sdss catalog . under a simplifying assumption that the sn rate is proportional to stellar @xmath10-band luminosity",
    ", we selected a random subset of galaxies weighted by luminosity .",
    "to each of these selected hosts we then assigned a fake sn .",
    "the sn was assigned a random @xmath10-band absolute magnitude in the range of @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes were converted to observed magnitudes using a distance modulus based on the sn host photometric redshift ( assuming a hubble parameter of @xmath48 , a mass density in units of the critical density @xmath49 , and cosmological constant @xmath50 ) .",
    "the sn @xmath11-band magnitude was randomly chosen to be in the range of @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the @xmath10 band magnitude , a range motivated by calculating synthetic @xmath10 and @xmath11 magnitudes from a set of observed spectra of sne ia ( nugent 2002 ; poznanski et al .",
    "2002 ; poznanski , maoz , & gal - yam 2007 ) .",
    "the fake sne were added to the real images as part of the data processing , prior to image registration , as follows .",
    "first , we randomly chose the image in which the sn was to be planted , i.e. , either the reference image or the registered one .",
    "we then cut out a region around the fake sn host of size @xmath53 times the host s @xmath54 light radius .",
    "sextractor was applied to the host stamp image , producing a list of @xmath55 light radii of the host .",
    "the radial distance of the fake sn from its host center was chosen randomly from among these annuli , assuring that the locations of the artificial sne roughly follow their galaxy host light .",
    "the final position of the fake sn with respect to the host was at a randomly chosen position angle .",
    "the sn was then planted in the selected image using the iraf task @xmath56 .",
    "the fake sn sample underwent the same processing as the real data , including the visual inspection stage , ensuring it reflected faithfully the actual detection efficiency . by spreading the fake sne among all the overlapping fields",
    ", we also took into account the fact that the efficiency may vary from field to field .",
    "our detection efficiency functions in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands are shown in figure @xmath57 .",
    "we find that our efficiency level is @xmath58 , at best .",
    "this is probably due to the poor quality of image subtraction when the psf matching and/or the registration are not perfect .",
    "for example , bright hosts often leave large residuals at their centers in the difference images",
    ". therefore , a real sn that is close to its host center , may be mistaken for an artificial residual due to poor registration , by either the pipeline or the human inspector .",
    "this effect seems to be independent of magnitude , even for bright sne , due to the fact that such sne will tend to be hosted by nearby , and hence bright , galaxies .",
    "it is also evident that the detection efficiency in the @xmath11 band starts declining at brighter magnitudes , compared to the @xmath10 band , probably due to the relative faintness of galaxies in the @xmath10-band .",
    "the sn candidates which pass the visual inspection are further explored . in order to obtain the magnitudes of these candidates , we download the images , in which a candidate resides , in the remaining ( @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) sdss bands .",
    "since the images of a field in different bands do not fully overlap , we first align them according to the image in which the candidate was detected ( in either the @xmath10 or the @xmath11 band ) .",
    "we perform this alignment for the reference field images and for the registered field images separately .",
    "then , the reference and registered field images in each band are processed by the same registration module used to originally process the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands ( see @xmath59 ) . after a final difference image",
    "is obtained in all five bands , @xmath60-pixel images are cut out around the candidate .",
    "these images are used to perform aperture photometry of the candidates .",
    "the counts are summed in an aperture of radius @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is @xmath63 of the fwhm of the average psf of a field ( taken from the sdss catalog `` field '' table ) . with the zeropoint , airmass , and extinction parameters ,",
    "also listed in the sdss catalog , we convert the candidate counts to magnitudes . to each magnitude",
    "we then apply an aperture correction , that accounts for the flux outside the aperture . from aperture photometry on bright and isolated sdss stars ,",
    "we find mean aperture corrections of @xmath64 in the @xmath22 bands , respectively . with these corrections ,",
    "our final magnitudes for bright stars also match those in the sdss catalogue .",
    "we corrected the candidate magnitudes for galactic extinction according to schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    to obtain realistic error estimates for our magnitude measurements",
    ", we have performed the same analysis on a large sample of artificial sne .",
    "the artificial sne were blindly planted in several images in the same manner as done for obtaining our detection efficiency functions ( see @xmath65 ) .",
    "we expect the photometric errors to be larger than the usual poisson errors due to inaccurate registration , varying backgrounds , and residuals from the host galaxy subtraction .",
    "we planted @xmath66 artificial sne in each of eight magnitude bins ( see table 1 ) . in each bin , and for each band , we calculate the root - mean square ( rms ) of the difference between the measured magnitudes and the original magnitudes assigned to the artificial sne , and adopt it as the systematic photometric error . the results are listed in table  1 .",

    "i.e. , can not be unambiguously associated with any detected galaxy .",
    "our criterion for hostlessness is being separated by both @xmath104 and more than two times the @xmath54 light radius from any galaxy .",
    "we first turn our attention to estimate the sample contamination by sn `` impostors '' . based on the sdss limiting magnitudes ( see section @xmath105 )",
    ", we estimate that a true sn ia , at maximum light , will be undetectable at redshifts @xmath106 . although there are exceptions , most core - collapse sne are less luminous than sne - ia . candidates with spectroscopic or photometric host redshifts with a @xmath107 lower limit above @xmath106",
    "are therefore excluded .",
    "six of the seven candidates excluded by this criteria are at their host centers , and are thus likely to be active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , rather than sne .",
    "the seventh candidate , sisn@xmath101 , which is not at the center of its host , might be a valid sn candidate falsely rejected due to an error in the photometric redshift of its host .",
    "however , if it were included in our final sample it would have no effect on the total number of type ia sne , being classified as a likely core - collapse sn ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the hostless candidates could be either real sne which reside in galaxies below the sdss limiting magnitude , or they can be impostors such as quasars , slow - moving asteroids , and variable stars . to estimate the expected fraction of sne hosted by galaxies fainter than the sdss limiting magnitude , we use the blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) galaxy luminosity function in the @xmath11 band .",
    "the fraction of the stellar luminosity in galaxies with a luminosity @xmath108 is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the luminosity function . at @xmath0 , the mean redshift of sne probed by our search ( see @xmath111 , below ) , the sdss @xmath11-band flux limit correspond to an absolute magnitude of @xmath112 mag , and @xmath113 . again assuming that sne track the stellar luminosity",
    ", we therefore expect @xmath114 candidates in galaxies below the sdss limiting magnitude , consistent with the @xmath103 hostless candidates we find .",
    "conversely , this also argues that most of the hostless candidates are likely real sne , as otherwise a large deficit of sne in low - luminosity galaxies would be implied .",
    "nonetheless , due to the lack of redshifts for the hostless candidates , we are unable to determine with great confidence which of those candidates are real sne and what are their types .",
    "we therefore exclude the @xmath103 hostless candidates from our sample for the purpose of the sn rate calculation .",
    "the exclusion of the hostless candidates is accounted for in the luminosity - normalized sn rate calculation by using the luminosity density which originates from galaxies above the sdss limiting magnitude ( see @xmath115 ) .",
    "kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) might also play a role as sn impostors .",
    "however , they are normally found near the ecliptic , while all our sn candidate have ecliptic latitude @xmath116 . moreover , according to their magnitude distribution ( bernstein et al .",

    "we note that while type ia s and iin s are observable up to a redshift of @xmath120 , given the sdss limiting magnitude , types ib / c and iip are observable only out to @xmath121 . we find that , in our redshift range , the value of @xmath122 is not indicative of the actual probability of an object being a sn ia .",
    "this is due to the fact that while sne ia usually are assigned very high values ( @xmath123 get @xmath124 ) for core - collapse sne the results are less obvious .",
    "about half the type iin and ib / c sne , and a fifth of the type iip sne get misclassified , with values of @xmath125 . as a consequence we use @xmath122 as a quality indicator , rather than a probability , cutting the sample at @xmath126 where the contamination by core - collapse sne is minimal .",
    "the fractions of simulated sne that are classified or misclassified as type ia by the sn - abc routine using the above threshold are @xmath127 , and @xmath81 for types ia , iip , iin , and ib / c , respectively . applying sn - abc together with a @xmath124 threshold on the @xmath2 candidates in our sample results in @xmath128 candidates which are classified as ia s , with @xmath129 values in the range @xmath130 .",
    "table @xmath45 lists the candidate properties , including sn types and host redshifts .    since we do not know the real fraction of type ia sne at low redshift , we create a sample of possible fractions of the different types , e.g. , @xmath131 , using steps of @xmath132 . for each set of fractions , we calculate the binomial probability of finding the observed @xmath128 sne ia out of @xmath2 , using the fractions of sne classified as type ia that we calculated for the four sn types . each of the combinations is given a weight according to the number of permutations with the same fraction of sne ia .",
