    "the starting point of all representation formulae of submanifolds is the celebrated _ weierstrass  enneper formula _ for minimal surfaces in @xmath0 : any minimal immersion @xmath3 is given locally in conformal coordinates @xmath4 by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is meromorphic and corresponds to the ( stereographic ) projection of the gauss map , @xmath7 is holomorphic , and @xmath8 is neither @xmath9 nor @xmath10 .",
    "this allows to describe locally ( and sometimes globally ) all minimal surfaces , and plays a key role in understanding and classifying them .",
    "however , this formula turns out to characterize many more surfaces than just the minimal ones : namely , and up to a cosmetic change , all surfaces , provided they are given in conformal coordinates .    indeed , in 1979 , kenmotsu @xcite generalized the formula to any two - dimensional conformal immersion in @xmath0 , with prescribed ( nonzero ) mean curvature @xmath11 , by proving that the gauss map and mean curvature actually determine the surface ( in the minimal case , an extra function @xmath7 is required ) . to that effect",

    "kusner & schmitt @xcite , following an idea of sullivan , proposed a similar albeit simpler expression , called the _ spinor representation formula _ , which gives locally all conformal immersions in @xmath0 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a @xmath14-valued map satisfying the following ( nonlinear ) `` dirac equation with potential '' @xmath15 where @xmath16 is called the potential , and the metric is @xmath17 . in the minimal case ,",

    "+ a few years later , konopelchenko @xcite and taimanov @xcite extended that formulation to conformally parametrized surfaces in @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 are complex valued functions , obviously defined up to a global sign change , satisfying the following dirac type equation , with complex potential  @xmath7 @xmath28 ( @xmath29 stands for the mean curvature vector and @xmath30 is again the conformal factor ) .",
    "the phase of @xmath7 will be understood later .",
    "a particular case of this equation was obtained independently by hlein & romon in their study of lagrangian immersions in euclidean space @xcite .",

    "finally , taimanov @xcite expanded the formula to three dimensional homogeneous manifolds .",
    "the formula itself barely changes ( see below ) , as well as the dirac equation , except for the potential .",
    "for example , if the ambient space is @xmath35 endowed with a left - invariant metric , then @xmath36    however , these representation formulae were purely local and computational in nature , and it was not clear what the relationship they had with the spin bundle until friedrich bridged the gap in @xcite .",
    "he showed that any surface @xmath37 immersed in @xmath0 inherits a spinor @xmath38 ( given an arbitrary choice of a parallel spinor ) , which satisfies dirac s equation with a potential , and can be used to reconstruct the immersion .",
    "this property was extended by morel to @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite , by roth to homogeneous spaces @xmath41 @xcite , and most recently by bayard , lawn & roth to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these abstract approaches all follow br s remark @xcite that an ambient spinor , restricted to an immersed submanifold @xmath37 , can be identified with an intrinsic spinor ( or , in some cases , with a section of a twisted spin bundle ) .",
    "if the ambient spinor field @xmath42 satisfies some particular pde , e.g. is parallel or killing , then the induced spinor @xmath38 also satisfies a pde , typically a dirac equation with a potential linked to the extrinsic geometric of @xmath37 .",
    "conversely ( and non trivially ) , the dirac equation with potential is shown to imply gauss and codazzi s equations ( and ricci s when needed ) , thus guaranteeing the ( local ) existence of an immersion with prescribed extrinsic data .",
    "+ our goal in this paper is to clarify and explicit the relationship between these two point of view , which has not been done before .",
    "in particular , we show how the concrete representation formulae and dirac equations are actually specific gauge choices of the general abstract formulae , explaining their simpler appearance .",
    "we give new and more direct proofs of theorems [ thm : fr ] and [ thm : blr ] below , avoiding the cumbersome gauss , codazzi and ricci equations ( although they are present implicitly ) , including their formulation in @xmath41 written in @xcite .",

    "we know from the beginning that @xmath88 satisfies the dirac equation , which in intrinsic coordinates yields for the induced metric and spinor coefficients @xmath507 . so that @xmath507 satisfy two differential systems , and we can identify the right hand side term by term , using the fact that @xmath184 is a vector space ( so quaternions split along the basis @xmath508 ) .",
