    "proteins are well - tailored chain molecules employed by life to store and replicate information , to carry out a dizzying array of functionalities and to provide a molecular basis for natural selection .",
    "a protein molecule is a large and complex physical system with many atoms .",
    "in addition , the water molecules surrounding the protein play a crucial role in its behavior . at the microscopic level , the laws of quantum mechanics can be used to deduce the interactions but the number of degrees of freedom are far too many for the system to be studied in all its detail .",
    "when one attempts to look at the problem in a coarse - grained manner@xcite with what one hopes are the essential degrees of freedom , it is very hard to determine what the effective potential energies of interaction are .",
    "this situation makes the protein problem particularly daunting and no solution has yet been found .",
    "nevertheless , proteins fold into a limited number@xcite of evolutionarily conserved structures@xcite .",
    "the same fold is able to house many different sequences which have that conformation as their native state and is also employed by nature to perform different biological functions , pointing towards the existence of an underlying simplicity and of a limited number of key principles at work in proteins .",
    "we have recently shown that a simple model which encapsulates a few general attributes common to all polypeptide chains , such as steric constraints@xcite , hydrogen bonding@xcite and hydrophobicity@xcite , gives rise to the emergent free energy landscape of globular proteins @xcite .",
    "the relatively few minima in the resulting landscape correspond to distinct putative marginally - compact native - state structures of proteins , which are tertiary assemblies of helices , hairpins and planar sheets .",
    "a superior fit@xcite of a given protein or sequence of amino acids to one of these pre - determined folds dictates the choice of the topology of its native - state structure . instead of each sequence shaping its own free energy landscape , we find that the overarching principles of geometry and symmetry determine the menu of possible folds that the sequence can choose from",
    ".    sequence design would favor the appropriate native state structure over the other putative ground states leading to a energy landscape conducive for rapid and reproducible folding of that particular protein .",
    "nature has a choice of 20 amino acids for the design of protein sequences .",
    "a pre - sculpted landscape greatly facilitates the design process .",
    "indeed we will show in detail that , within our model , a crude design scheme , which takes into account the hydrophobic ( propensity to be buried ) and polar ( desire to be exposed to the water ) character of the amino acids , is sufficient to carry out a successful design of sequences with one of the structures shown in fig .",
    "we model a protein as a chain of _ identical _ amino acids , represented by their @xmath0 atoms , lying along the axis of a self - avoiding flexible tube .",
    "the preferential parallel placement of nearby tube segments approximately mimics the effects of the anisotropic interaction of hydrogen bonds , while the space needed for the clash - free packing of side chains is approximately captured by the non - zero tube thickness@xcite .",
    "a tube description places constraints on the radii of circles drawn through both local and non - local triplets of @xmath0 positions of a protein native structure@xcite .",
    "unlike unconstrained matter for which pairwise interactions suffice , for a chain molecule , it is necessary to define the context of the object that is part of the chain .",
    "this is most easily carried out by defining a local cartesian coordinate system whose three axes are defined by the tangent to the chain at that point , the normal , and the binormal which is perpendicular to both the other two vectors .",
    "a study@xcite of the experimentally determined native state structures of proteins from the protein data bank reveals that there are clear amino acid aspecific geometrical constraints on the relative orientation of the local coordinate systems due to sterics and also associated with amino acids which form hydrogen bonds with each other .",
    "similar geometrical constraints had already been introduced in off - lattice polymer models @xcite in order to model hydrogen bond formation .",
    "the geometrical constraints associated with the formation of hydrogen bonds and with the tube description within the @xmath0 representation of our model are described in detail elsewhere@xcite . in our representation of the protein backbone ,",
    "local hydrogen bonds form between @xmath0 atoms separated by three along the sequence with an energy defined to be @xmath1 unit , whereas non - local hydrogen bonds are those that form between @xmath0 atoms separated by more than @xmath2 along the sequence with an energy of @xmath3 .",
    "this energy difference is based on experimental findings that the local bonds provide more stability to a protein than do the non - local hydrogen bonds@xcite .",
    "cooperativity effects@xcite are taken into account by adding an energy of @xmath4 units when consecutive hydrogen bonds along the sequence are formed .",
    "there are two other ingredients in the model : a local bending penalty @xmath5 which is related to the steric hindrance of the amino acid side chains and a pair - wise interaction @xmath6 of the standard type mediated by the water@xcite .",
    "note that whereas the geometrical constraints associated with the tube and hydrogen bonds are representative of the typical _ aspecific _ behavior of the interacting amino acids , the latter properties clearly depend on the _ specific _ amino acids involved in the interaction .",
    "monte carlo simulations have been carried out with pivot and crankshaft moves commonly used in stochastic chain dynamics @xcite .",
    "a metropolis procedure is employed with a thermal weight @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy of the conformation and @xmath9 is the effective temperature .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the ground state phase diagram obtained from monte - carlo computer simulations using the simulated annealing technique@xcite , along with the corresponding conformations , for a @xmath10 beads homopolymer @xcite .",
    "the solvent - mediated energy , @xmath6 , and the local bending penalty , @xmath5 , are measured in units of the local hydrogen bond energy .",
    "when @xmath6 is sufficiently repulsive ( hydrophilic ) ( and @xmath11 in the phase diagram ) , one obtains a swollen phase with very few contacts between the @xmath0 atoms .",
    "when @xmath6 is sufficiently attractive , one finds a very compact , globular phase with featureless ground states with a high number of contacts .    between these two phases ( and in the vicinity of the swollen phase ) , a marginally compact phase emerges ( the interactions barely stabilize the ordered phase ) with distinct structures including a single helix , a bundle of two helices , a helix formed by @xmath12-strands , a @xmath12-hairpin , three - stranded @xmath12-sheets with two distinct topologies and a @xmath12-barrel like conformation .",
    "these structures are the stable ground states in different parts of the phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , other conformations , closely resembling distinct super - secondary arrangements observed in proteins@xcite , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are found to be competitive local minima , whose stability can be enhanced , as we will see , by sequence design after heterogeneity is introduced by means of , for example , non - uniform values of curvature energy penalties for single amino acids and hydrophobic interactions for amino acid pairs . note that while there is a remarkable similarity between the structures that we obtain and protein folds , our simplified coarse - grained model is not as accurate as an all - atom representation of the poly - peptide chain in capturing features such as the packing of amino acid side chains .",
    "the common belief in the field of proteins is that given a sequence of amino acids , with all the attendant details of the side chains and the surrounding water , one obtains a funnel - like landscape with the minimum corresponding to its native state structure .",
    "each protein is characterized by its own landscape . in this scenario ,",
    "the protein sequence is all - important and the protein folding problem , besides becoming tremendously complex , needs to be attacked on a protein - by - protein basis .",
    "in contrast , our model calculations show that the large number of common attributes of globular proteins@xcite reflect a deeper underlying unity in their behavior . at odds with conventional belief",
    ", the gross features of the energy landscape of proteins result from the amino acid aspecific common features of all proteins , as is clearly established by the fact that different putative native structures are found to be competing minima for the same homopolymeric chain .",
    "the protein energy landscape is _",
    "( pre)sculpted _ by general considerations of geometry and symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , which are the essential ingredients in our model .",
    "our unified framework suggests that the protein energy landscape ought to have around a thousand of broad minima corresponding to putative native state structures .",
    "the key point is that for each of these minima the desirable funnel - like behavior is already achieved at the homopolymer level _ in the marginally compact part of the phase diagram_. the self - tuning of two key length scales , the thickness of the tube and the interaction range , to be comparable to each other and the interplay of the three energy scales , hydrophobic , hydrogen bond , and bending energy , in such a way as to stabilize marginally compact structures , also provide the close cooperation between energy gain and entropy loss needed for the sculpting of a funneled energy landscape . at the same time ,",
    "relatively small changes in the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 lead to significant differences in the emergent ground state structure , underscoring the sensitive role played by chemical heterogeneity in selecting from the menu of native state folds .",
    "the introduction of sequence heterogeneity at the level of differantiating hydropohobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues and a crude designe scheme based on a common sense choice of the hydrophobicity profile for the sequence suffices to ensure that the designed sequence would fold into a desired fold selected from the predetermined menu .",
    "for example , the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath12 motif shown as ( j ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( which is a local energy minimum for a homopolymer ) can be stabilized into a global energy minimum for the sequence hphhhpppphhpphhpppphhhpp , with @xmath14 for hh contacts and @xmath15 for other contacts , and @xmath16 for all residues .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamic properties of the folding transition for this case .",
    "the contour plots at different temperatures ( above and at the folding transition temperature ) of the effective free energy are shown in fig . [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) as a function of the total energy of the chain and its root mean squared deviation ( rmsd ) from the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath12 conformation obtained as a local minimum in the homopolymer case .",
    "the folding transition temperature was identified at @xmath17 from the peak of the specific heat curve ( data not shown ) .",
    "the free energy landscape is not too smooth at low temperatures , but it can be roughly be described as a three state landscape . above the folding transition",
    "there is one broad minimum , corresponding to the denatured state ensemble .",
    "the two clearly distinct minima which dominate the free energy landscape below the folding transition correspond to the designed conformation ( in the case of the lower rmsd ) and to a different conformation ( with higher rmsd ) .",
    "both structures share the same number of hh contacts as well as local , non - local , and cooperative hydrogen bonds , differing just in the way the two strands are connected with the helix ( see figure [ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "note that both minima are consistently characterized by roughly the same energy .",
    "this degeneracy is due to the lack of detail of the model and to the crudeness of the design scheme utilized here , since the hydrophobic core is well formed in both cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](d ) ) . indeed , if one groups both conformations within the same fold classification , this is a clear example of how , in the presence of a presculpted energy landscape , it is relatively easy to design a sequence with the ability to fold cooperatively into a given fold , as real small globular proteins do .",
    "in summary , within a simple , yet realistic , framework , we have shown @xcite that protein native - state structures can arise from considerations of symmetry and geometry associated with the polypeptide chain .",
    "the sculpting of the free energy landscape with relatively few broad minima is consistent with the fact that proteins can be designed to enable rapid folding to their native states .",
    "here we have shown that by introducing heterogeneity within the simplest hydrophobic - polar scheme , it is straightforward to design a sequence that is able to fold cooperatively into one of the presculpted minima in the energy landscape .",
