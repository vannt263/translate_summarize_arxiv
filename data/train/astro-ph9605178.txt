    "supernovae of type ia have been considered for decades and are still considered by some to be almost perfect distance indicators .",
    "actually , some scatter in their photometric properties was suggested as early as the late sixties @xcite , but it has been mostly attributed to photometric errors ( e.g. sandage & tammann 1993 ) .    however , in recent years the discovery of two extreme snia , 1991 t and 1991bg , challenged the standard candle scenario for snia , 1991 t being brighter than the average snia @xcite and 1991bg significantly fainter @xcite .",
    "the two sne also showed distinctive spectral peculiarities which , however , might have gone unnoticed if only sparse observations had been gathered .",
    "therefore , a question arises : are the samples of snia used as standard candles heavily contaminated by such extreme objects and how much such contamination affects the derived values of h@xmath7 and q@xmath8 ?",
    "the question has been further complicated by the recognition that even snia with very similar spectra can show a significant spread in absolute magnitude @xcite , which may correlate with the photometric evolution and even with the morphological type of the parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "supernovae of different intrinsic brightness have different probabilities of being detected , hence it is expected that the intrinsic fraction of faint sne is higher than the actual percentage of discoveries .",
    "this has implications for the chemical evolution of the galaxies , since snia are thought to be a primary source of fe - peak elements .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present and discuss new photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn  1991bg describing the evolution of this object until the late nebular stages and to highlight peculiarities and similarities compared with other snia .",
    "some quantitative indications on the precursor star and the total amount of synthesized material will also be given .",
    "sn  1991bg was discovered on 1991 dec .",
    "9.8 by r. kushida @xcite about 1 arcmin south of the nucleus of the elliptical galaxy ngc  4374 , which is located near the center of the virgo cluster .    the observations at the eso ",
    "la silla and asiago observatories started soon after the discovery and continued for the next seven months , until the virgo cluster disappeared behind the sun .",
    "eventually the sn was detected 530 days after maximum .",
    "the broad band b , v and r photometry ( together with two i - band observations ) are listed in tab .",
    "[ phot ] . depending on the brightness of the object and on instrument schedule ,",
    "several different telescopes were used .",
    "on photometric nights sequences of standard stars @xcite were observed which allowed the determination of the color equations of the photometric systems .",
    "these were in good agreement with the determinations by other authors . for calibrating the non  photometric nights",
    ", a local sequence was established around the galaxy .",
    "for the stars in common with the sequence of leibundgut et al . and filippenko et al .",
    ", our measurements agree to within a few hundredths of a magnitude with those of the above authors .    until 200d",
    "the photometric measurements were performed with the romafot package , whose utilization in the context of sne has already been discussed ( cfr .",
    "turatto et al .",
    "the errors in the sn magnitudes depend on the contrast of the star against the galaxy background and were estimated to range from 0.05 at early epochs up to 0.2 mag at seven months . in fig .",
    "[ lc ] our measurements are plotted together with those by filippenko et al . and leibundgut et al .",
    "it is evident that while at early epochs the agreement between the different sources is good , it becomes poor as the sn fades .",
    "in particular , at about 150 days our estimates appears 0.5 mag fainter than those of leibundgut et al . .",
    "since the zero point is the same ( the local sequences coincide ) , the inconsistency has to be attributed to the measuring technique . both leibundgut et al . and filippenko et al . derived the sn magnitudes by means of aperture photometry but , while the former authors measured the background in an annulus around the sn , the latter ones , exploiting the symmetric surface brightness profile of the elliptical parent galaxy , subtracted the image of the galaxy rotated by @xmath9 around the major axis .",
    "we have tested the measurements of the sn magnitude with both these methods : already at epochs earlier than @xmath10 days the subtraction of annuli produced results dependent on the radii of the annuli , while the subtraction of the rotated galaxy gave results within a few hundredths of magnitude of our romafot determination .",
    "based on the first , unsuccessful attempt to recover the sn , in january 1993 , upper limits for the sn magnitude were derived by placing increasingly fainter artificial stars at the precise position of the sn relative to nearby stars .",
    "the result was @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a somewhat fainter upper limit was obtained using an image taken with the wfc of hst on 6 march , 1993 in the f555w passband ( very close to the standard v ) and retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "the exposure was not very deep ( 300 s ) and the frame was processed with the routine science data processing pipeline . using both the internal calibration of the frame and a faint comparison sequence calibrated with our deep ground ",
    "based observations , we found v@xmath13 for the sn at this epoch .    finally , a series of 17 exposures ( total observing time 170 min ) was obtained on may 26 , 1993 , i.e. 530 days after b maximum .",
    "the frames were flat fielded , aligned and co - added into a single exposure in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "although the seeing was not exceptional ( 1.15 arcsec ) a stellar image was found within 0.1 arcsec from the expected position ( fig  [ may93 ] ) . in this case , the sn magnitude was also measured using snoopy , a new software especially designed for sn photometry by one of us ( f.p . ) . as for romafot , in snoopy",
    "the magnitude is derived by means of the point - spread - function - fitting technique , but background fitting was improved and interactivity enhanced ( patat , in preparation ) .",
    "the resulting magnitude was v=24.95 .",
    "the error of the measurement was estimated by means of artificial star tests .",
    "the dispersion of the recovered magnitudes of 50 artificial stars positioned near the sn was r.m.s.=0.40 mag .

    "1992 ) ; ( e ) the expansion velocity of siii in sn  1991 t was a poor indicator of the photospheric velocity .",
    "velocities measured from other lines were significantly larger than in normal snia ( phillips et al . 1992 ) .    a number of possible explosion scenarios have been proposed to explain the peculiar characteristics of sn  1991bg , and in general the faint snia .",
    "hoflich et al .",
    "used delayed detonation models to explain snia light curves .",
    "they argued that , depending on the density at which the transition from deflagration to detonation occurs , different @xmath18ni masses and , therefore , snia of different luminosity can be produced by the same explosion mechanism in a chandrasekhar mass c - o wd . in particular , their pdd5 model , which produces 0.12 m@xmath19 of @xmath18ni , gives the best fit to the sn 1991bg observations .",
    "in this model the @xmath18ni is strongly concentrated in the center , as indicated also by our observations , and a major fraction of the mass is in intermediate mass elements , with only about 0.05 m@xmath19 of unburned c / o left after the explosion .",
    "however , this model requires a large reddening , e(b - v)=0.30 , in order to reconcile the predicted luminosity with the observed value , while observations indicate a much smaller value , e(b - v)@xmath20 ( cfr .",
    "[ abma ] ) . also , the decline rates of the pdd5 model are similar to those of their standard ia model ( n32 ) , while we found sn 1991bg to be faster ( cfr . sect . [ licu ] ) .    an alternative scenario for faint snia",
    "was proposed by livne and woosley & weaver . in their models a c",
    " o white dwarf with mass below the chandrasekhar limit accretes he at a rate of the order of a few @xmath21 m@xmath19 yr@xmath22 until he ignites at the bottom of the layer .",
    "the in - going shock wave induces a detonation of the c - o which disrupts the star . according to woosley &",
    "weaver less massive white dwarfs produce smaller @xmath18ni masses and less energy , in qualitative agreement with our findings . the lower mass wd results in a larger fraction of intermediate mass elements and an overproduction of other isotopes ( including ti@xmath23 ) in the he detonation layer , while a large fraction of he is left unburned .",
    "we already noted , however , that an overproduction of @xmath23ti is not required by the spectral synthesis models .",
    "the visibility of he in the ejecta is not expected because of the observed low temperatures . moreover , the models of mazzali et al .",
    "seem to exclude the short rise times to maximum light ( of the order of 13d ) which are obtained by woosley & weaver .",
    "these sub  chandrasekhar models produce in the interior a nearly constant velocity as a function of mass and , therefore , they do not the reproduce the low velocities observed in sn  1991bg at late stages .    in another explosion mechanism , proposed by nomoto et al .",
    ", a low mass of @xmath18ni is produced by the collapse of a o  ne  mg wd formed after the merging of a double c  o wd system . in order to reproduce the observed luminosity the collapsing core has to be embedded in a c  o envelope of 0.6 m@xmath19 and the shock wave propagating through it produces 0.15 m@xmath19 of @xmath18ni , compatible with the estimates found above .",
    "the resulting light curve reproduces satisfactorily the observed one in the early 100 days but si seems to be located at velocities too high to reproduce the observed lines .",
    "unfortunately the observations alone do not suggest unambiguously a preferred model for the progenitor .",
    "all suffer from the various difficulties discussed above .",
    "mazzali et al .",
    "show through modelling that even in the most promising models one has to resort to ad hoc adjustments of abundances and their stratification to approximate the observed spectra .",
    "thus sn 1991bg has provided an additional challenge to our understanding the type ia supernova phenomena .",
    "the new observations presented in this paper confirm the peculiar characteristics of sn  1991bg and give new insights into its late time behaviour .",
    "in particular , sn  1991bg was fainter than normal snia by about 2.5 magnitudes in the b band , but by less than 2 mags in the v band , thus giving a particularly red colour at maximum , ( b - v)@xmath0 .",
    "however , because of a different colour evolution , the sn turned to the colour curve of normal snia already 4050 days later .",
    "the rates of decline in all optical bands ( bvri ) are at all epochs the most rapid ever observed in snia ( tab .  [ data ] ) .",
    "the constructed _ uvoir _ bolometric light curve is consequently steeper than in the normal sn  ia sn  1992a .",
    "a very deep v band observation obtained 530 days past maximum showed that before this epoch the fading rate had decreased to about 1.2 100 , and we stress that , on the basis of the available data , energy sources other than co decay are not required .",
    "the low luminosity at maximum is an indication that the sn produced a small mass of ni ( @xmath24 m@xmath19 ) , whereas the fast photometric evolution was related to a small mass of the envelope .",
    "the small explosion energy also causes the photosphere at maximum light to be cooler than in typical snia , as is evident when comparing the early time spectra .",
    "this also explains the broad absorption feature between 4200 - 4500   identified with tiii , which has been attributed to an ionization effect by mazzali et al . .",
    "a peculiarity of the spectrum of sn  1991bg at epochs subsequent to maximum is the presence of the two narrow features at about 5700  ( in absorption ) and 5900  ( in emission ) .",
    "the absorption lacks at the moment a convincing explanation mainly because there is no significant evolution redwards , while the emission , which appeared already on day 34 , is plausibly an early emergence of [ coiii ] in accordance with the fast evolution to the nebular stage shown by sn  1991bg .",
    "it has been noted that the spectrum of sn  1991bg evolved to the nebular stage earlier than usual .",
    "contrary to previous claims , the overall appearance of the spectrum maintained a general resemblance to those of other snia at least until 200 days after maximum light ( fig .",
    "[ late ] ) , indicating that the ionization conditions of the fe core were similar to those of other snia at this phase .",
    "in particular , there has been no sudden change in the nature of the spectrum during the interval day 143 to day 203 . nevertheless , the emission lines were exceptionally narrow , and allowed the identification of the main emissions with lines of [ feii ] , [ feiii ] and [ coiii ] .",
    "the presence of hydrogen at late times seems unlikely .    the small photospheric expansion velocity and envelope mass , combined with the the small expansion velocity and mass of the fe  group core , as seen from the late - time spectra and luminosity , point to a kinetic energy smaller than in typical snia .",
    "we pointed out that the correlation between the luminosity at maximum and the early rate of decline can be extended also to the expansion velocities of the photosphere at maximum and to the innermost layers emitting the nebular spectrum ( tab .",
    "[ explate ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the luminosity at maximum correlates to the kinetic energy of the snia .",
    "one important question is whether the lower energy sn  1991bg can be considered an extreme case of a continuous distribution of snia or whether it is a representative of a separate subclass of faint sne  ia .",
    "we reviewed the literature and found that while a handful of other snia shared some of the observed characteristics of sn  1991bg , none was quite so extreme .",
    "this may support the concept of a continuum transition from faint snia ( sn  1991bg  like ) to _ normal _ ones .",
    "obviously , a continuum of sn  ia properties might jeopardize their use as standard candles , at least until one understands better the inter - relation between light curves and spectral characteristics .",
