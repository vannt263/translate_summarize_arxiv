    "the basic physics of the burst onset is that of the well - known thin - shell thermal instability @xcite , which operates as follows . in equilibrium , the energy that is generated by nuclear burning",
    "is exactly balanced by the outward diffusion of photons coupled with radiation from the stellar surface .",
    "if the nuclear reaction rates are sufficiently temperature - sensitive , a positive temperature perturbation causes the nuclear energy generation rate to increase faster than the rate at which the stellar surface can cool , causing a thermonuclear runaway and hence a type i x - ray burst .",
    "the physics of this instability can be described quite well with a simple one - zone model @xcite .",
    "if the amount of accreted matter needed to ignite a burst were roughly independent of the accretion rate @xmath1 , as suggested by simple models , one would expect the recurrence time @xmath9 to vary as @xmath10 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with observations for a range of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the mass accretion rate at which the accretion luminosity is equal to the eddington limit .",

    "unlike thin - shell thermal instability models , for which one assumes that purely thermal perturbations trigger bursts , nh03 s analysis was quite general and made no assumptions as to the trigger mechanism . apart from confirming the standard thermal instability for @xmath16",
    ", nh03 discovered a new regime of unstable nuclear burning for @xmath13 that they referred to as `` delayed mixed bursts . ''",
    "this regime reproduced the increase in @xmath9 with increasing @xmath1 seen in observations , as well as the occurrence of considerable stable burning between successive bursts .",
    "it also predicted the absence of bursts for @xmath17 , again in agreement with observations .",

    ".    it is perhaps not surprising that a global linear stability analysis is able to reproduce type i x - ray burst observations better than simple thin - shell thermal instability models .",
    "however , the fact that the results of all time - dependent multi - zone models with large reaction networks conflict with observations as well @xcite is much more problematic . like the global linear stability analysis",
    ", these latter models include no preconceived instability criteria .",
    "therefore , they should in principle be able to reproduce the regime of delayed mixed bursts and the absence of bursts for @xmath18 , as observed in nature .",
    "the disagreement between the predictions of time - dependent multi - zone burst models and the global linear stability analysis of nh03 suggests that some crucial aspect of the physics is different between the two .",
    "understanding this discrepancy is of fundamental importance in the study of type i x - ray bursts .",
    "while the global linear stability analysis of nh03 , with its identification of the delayed mixed burst regime , succeeded in reproducing several puzzling observations of bursts , unfortunately , the complexity of the model and the absence of a specific stability criterion make it difficult to understand the basic physics of delayed mixed bursts .",
    "to rectify this situation , we construct here a simple two - zone model that reproduces all of the basic features of the global analysis .",
    "we begin in  [ themodel ] with a derivation of our model . in  [ eqandstab ] , we discuss the equilibria of the model and analyze their stability as a function of accretion rate .",
    "we then integrate the equations that govern the model and use the results in  [ tevolve ] to explain the physics of the onset of delayed mixed bursts .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ discussion ] , and we conclude in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we assume that matter accretes spherically onto a neutron star of gravitational mass @xmath19 and areal radius @xmath20 at an accretion rate per unit area @xmath21 as measured in the local frame of the accreted plasma .",
    "we consider all physical quantities to be functions of the column depth @xmath22 , which we define as the rest mass of the accreted matter as measured from the stellar surface divided by @xmath23 .",

    "several authors have introduced more elaborate two - zone models of type i x - ray bursts @xcite , but these models usually include only helium burning , and all of the nuclear burning is confined to a single zone . @xcite present a two - zone model of thermonuclear burning on accreting white dwarfs that includes both hydrogen and helium burning , but the two fuels are forced to burn in separate zones by construction .",
    "this approximation is too severe for realistic modeling of type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the global linear stability analysis of nh03 clearly shows that the interaction between hydrogen and helium burning plays a key role in delayed mixed bursts .",
    "motivated by this , we describe in this paper a new model with the following two zones : ( i ) a zone that begins at the surface of the star , where @xmath31 , and extends to the depth @xmath55 at which hydrogen is depleted via nuclear burning , and ( ii ) a zone that begins at @xmath55 and extends to the depth @xmath56 at which helium is depleted via nuclear burning .",
    "hydrogen , helium , and cno are all present in zone ( i ) , while only helium and cno are present in zone ( ii ) .",

    "we make the simplification that all thermonuclear processes within a zone take place at the bottom of that zone .",
    "equation ( [ entropyeqn ] ) thus implies that the flux @xmath59 in a particular zone is a constant with respect to @xmath22 , and so @xmath60 varies linearly with @xmath22 within each zone ( see equation [ transfereqn ] ) .    in the simplest one - zone models ,",

    "to better understand the physics of the overstability preceding a delayed mixed burst , we consider a positive @xmath69 perturbation .",
    "since the thermal diffusion time from @xmath55 to @xmath56 is very short , @xmath70 follows the time dependence of @xmath69 throughout the integration .",
    "an increase in @xmath69 causes the helium in zone ( i ) to burn at a higher rate , which increases @xmath68 , and the simultaneous increase in @xmath70 causes the helium in zone ( ii ) to burn at a higher rate also , which decreases @xmath56 .",
    "the larger @xmath68 causes hydrogen to burn at a higher rate , which decreases @xmath55 .",
    "this raises the effective cooling rate of the accreted layer , which is proportional to @xmath185 . when nuclear burning has nearly depleted the hydrogen in zone ( i ) , both of the zones cool as freshly accreted matter advects down to larger column depths . @xmath69 and @xmath70 consequently decrease until enough nuclear fuel has accumulated to restart nuclear burning .",
    "once this happens , @xmath69 and @xmath70 will increase and the cycle continues .",
    "if the amplitudes of the oscillations increase in time , the temperature @xmath70 at @xmath56 may raise the helium nuclear energy generation rate high enough to trigger a thin - shell thermal instability and hence a type i x - ray burst .",
    "to understand when the burst will occur , we follow the basic one - zone , single - parameter linear stability analysis of @xcite and consider the effective radiative cooling rate at @xmath56 @xmath186 a thin - shell thermal instability develops when @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath188 in the bottom panel of figure [ overstab ] .",
    "a comparison between the lightcurve shown in the middle panel and the ratio @xmath189 in the bottom panel shows that a short type i x - ray burst , characterized by a sudden increase in the outward flux , occurs when the thin - shell thermal instability criterion @xmath190 is satisfied .",
    "note that the low peak flux of the burst is due to the restriction in our model that hydrogen burns only via the temperature - independent hot cno cycle . in our two - zone model ,",
    "this delayed mixed burst calculation evolves to a limit cycle of short bursts with a recurrence time @xmath191 . in reality",
    ", hydrogen burning will proceed via the rp - process of @xcite during the burst , and this will burn nearly all of the fuel and produce an eddington - limited flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the system will then restart near @xmath192 in figure [ overstab ] and undergo several oscillations before having its next burst .",
    "our two - zone model , which includes no rp - process reactions , is too simple to reproduce this behavior .",
    "note also that , while equation ( [ epscooleqn ] ) is the exact cooling rate for a suitably constructed one - zone model , it is only approximate for our two - zone model .",
    "however , it is accurate enough to illustrate that , much like prompt bursts , helium burning ultimately induces a thin - shell thermal instability that triggers a delayed mixed burst .",
    "while the above calculation illustrates the physics of the onset of delayed mixed bursts , it does not unambiguously demonstrate that the bursts are in fact `` delayed . ''",
    "specifically , we have not yet demonstrated that a significant period of stable burning will precede a type i x - ray burst .",
    "although we began the integration by perturbing the equilibrium solution , a system that is dynamically unstable need not come anywhere close to its equilibrium .",
    "unfortunately , we can not set the initial conditions to that of a bare neutron star , for which @xmath193 \\{@xmath194 } = \\{@xmath195 } , because the time steps required to begin the integration from these initial conditions are too small to maintain numerical accuracy .",
    "instead , we set @xmath193 \\{@xmath196 , @xmath124 } , i.e.  we start the system with the hydrogen - burning layer in place but without any helium - burning layer .",
    "we then integrate until a type i x - ray burst occurs .",
    "this calculation gives a recurrence time @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the integration time . from the recurrence time",
    ", we derive an estimate for the dimensionless quantity @xmath3 , which is defined as the accretion energy released between successive bursts divided by the nuclear energy released during a burst .",
    "thus , @xmath199{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}}+ ( 1-{z_{\\mathrm{h}}}){e^{*}_{\\mathrm{he}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{he}}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath200 is the gravitational redshift , and the values of @xmath55 , @xmath68 , and @xmath56 are determined from the numerical integration just prior to the burst .",
    "both the accretion energy and nuclear energy of the burst in equation ( [ alphaeqn ] ) are those measured locally at the stellar surface . in our expression for @xmath3 , we implicitly assume that all of the hydrogen and helium burns to cno during a burst . figure [ alphas ] shows that @xmath201 in the regime of prompt bursts , which is consistent with more sophisticated calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and that @xmath3 rises dramatically to values @xmath202 for @xmath203 , which illustrates that the systems in the delayed mixed burst regime undergo long periods of stable nuclear burning prior to type i x - ray bursts . this is consistent with both the results of nh03 ( see their figures 15 and 18 ) and observations @xcite .",
    "in this section , we compare and contrast the results of the two - zone model presented in this work with the results of both the global linear stability analysis of nh03 and other theoretical models .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to construct a simple model of nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars that elucidates the essential physics behind the more complicated and abstruse global linear stability analysis of nh03 .",
    "we assess how well we have accomplished this goal below .",
    "we begin by discussing the various bursting regimes and the ranges of accretion rates @xmath135 in which these regimes lie .",
    "a comparison between the results of  [ eqandstab ] and table 3 of nh03 demonstrates that the two - zone model reproduces all of the bursting regimes of nh03 for the relatively high @xmath135 considered in this work , and that the ranges of @xmath135 coincide very well with the results of nh03 s `` canonical '' neutron star , for which @xmath204 , @xmath205 km , and @xmath206 k .",
    "however , the two - zone model can not reproduce the hydrogen bursts that occur for @xmath207 because unstable thermonuclear hydrogen burning triggers these burst , but our expression for @xmath89 is temperature - independent .",
    "we note that the @xmath135 ranges of the various regimes in the two - zone model depend somewhat on the values of @xmath208 and @xmath209 , assumed constant in our model .    the methods used to determine the equilibrium solution in each model differ somewhat , although this difference should not affect the eigenvalue .",
    "nh03 started with an assumed column depth of accreted plasma @xmath210 and determined the equilibrium solution of the physical quantities @xmath76 , @xmath47 , @xmath59 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 as functions of @xmath22 .",
    "next , they carried out a linear perturbation analysis to determine the stability of the equilibrium solution .",
    "if @xmath211 , where in this case @xmath212 , then the configuration was unstable and a type i x - ray burst was assumed to occur . if @xmath213 , the configuration was stable , and the process was repeated for a larger value of @xmath210 . if @xmath214 for all trial values of @xmath210 , then the system was stable , and no type i x - ray bursts occurred .",
    "it is important to understand that the method of nh03 will find all systems that have positive eigenvalues to be unstable because @xmath162 increases as @xmath210 increases . in the two - zone model ,",
    "we assume complete burning of the accreted matter , and we say that type i x - ray bursts occur if @xmath215 and that no bursts occur otherwise .",
    "if a system is stable to bursts , the accreted matter steadily burns to completion , and both methods agree that this equilibrium is stable . if a system is unstable to bursts , the two - zone model determines that the complete steady - burning equilibrium solution is unstable .",
    "the method of nh03 may find that the identical system is unstable either before all of the fuel burns to completion ( in a prompt burst , for example ) or after all the fuel burns to completion ( in , say , a delayed burst ) , but it will always determine that the system is indeed unstable . therefore ,",
    "although the two stability analyses differ to some extent , these differences are unimportant with respect to the determination of the eigenvalue of a system .",
    "the eigenvalues derived using the two models agree quite well .",
    "we have shown already that the real parts of the eigenvalues agree quite well , for they delineate between the prompt and delayed bursting regimes .",
    "we now compare the imaginary parts .",
    "we have shown in  [ eqandstab ] that @xmath157 in the delayed mixed burst regime , which means that oscillations occur with a period equal to the hydrogen - burning timescale . to explicitly show that @xmath157 in the global linear stability analysis , we consider the calculation presented in  4.2 of nh03 . in that calculation , nh03 consider a system with @xmath216 , which implies that @xmath217 @xmath218 , since @xmath219 @xmath218 for that system .",
    "figures 8 and 9 of nh03 imply that @xmath220 @xmath221 , and so @xmath222 @xmath223 from equations ( [ oheqn ] ) and ( [ theqn ] ) .",
    "this value of @xmath158 is very close to the @xmath224 @xmath223 nh03 quote for the imaginary part of the eigenvalue they obtained in their calculation .",
    "@xcite discovered a class of low - frequency oscillations that precede type i x - ray bursts in the systems 4u 1608@xmath225522 , 4u 1636@xmath225536 , and aql x-1 .",
    "these oscillations have periods @xmath226 seconds and have been observed when the accretion rate @xmath227 . while the modes resulting from the global stability analysis of nh03 are complex in this regime , the oscillation periods of these modes are roughly a factor of @xmath228 larger than the observed periods .",
    "it is now clear why nh03 were unsuccessful in explaining these observations .",
    "we have shown in  [ eqandstab ] that the oscillation periods of overstable modes in this regime are approximately equal to the hydrogen - burning timescale @xmath179 . from equations ( [ eqeqn1 ] ) and ( [ theqn ] ) , @xmath229 thus the oscillations preceding a delayed mixed burst have too long of a period and can not be associated with the oscillations observed by @xcite if hydrogen burns predominantly via the hot cno cycle .    we have shown in  4 that , in the delayed mixed burst regime , a considerable amount of stable burning occurs prior to a type i x - ray burst . consequently , @xmath3 , the ratio of the gravitational energy released via accretion to the nuclear energy released during a burst , rises dramatically near the critical @xmath135 above which bursts do not occur .",
    "a comparison between figure [ alphas ] of this work and figure 15 of nh03 demonstrates that the @xmath3-values derived using the two different models agree quite well .    using an improved version of the model of nh03 , @xcite found that increasing @xmath110 , the cno abundance of the accreted plasma , diminishes the range of @xmath135 over which delayed mixed bursts occur .",
    "in fact , for large enough values of @xmath110 , @xcite found that the ranges of @xmath135 in which prompt mixed bursts and delayed mixed bursts occur are separated by a regime of stable burning .",
    "figure [ zgraphs]@xmath230 shows the normalized eigenvalues of the two - zone model for systems in which @xmath231 .",
    "the critical @xmath135 above which bursts do not occur decreases with increasing @xmath110 , in agreement with figure 5 of @xcite , but the two - zone model does not reproduce the regime of stable burning that separates the prompt mixed bursts from the delayed mixed bursts for our choices of @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "however , we are able to reproduce this regime with certain combinations of @xmath110 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 .",

    "a stable burning regime separating prompt mixed bursts from the delayed mixed bursts is clearly evident for this calculation , showing that the two - zone model has the right qualitative behavior .",
    "however , our choice of @xmath110 for this calculation is more than twice that required in the more accurate model of @xcite , showing that ( not surprisingly ) there are quantitative discrepancies .      for accretion rates",
    "@xmath235 , type i x - ray bursts are well - understood theoretically , and the results of theoretical models are generally in accord with observations .",
    "this is not true for @xmath236 .",
    "nearly all theoretical models predict that accreting neutron stars should exhibit type i x - ray bursts for all @xmath237 @xcite , whereas the model of nh03 and the two - zone model presented in this work suggest that bursts should cease for @xmath238 , in agreement with observations @xcite . furthermore , our model and that of nh03 are the only models able to explain the dramatic increase in @xmath3 with increasing @xmath135 observed by @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we compare and contrast the two - zone model presented in this work with previous one - zone burst models .",
    "additionally , we discuss the results of this work in relation to those of detailed time - dependent multi - zone models that utilize sophisticated nuclear reaction networks .",
    "we begin by discussing the stability criterion of one - zone models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models presume that helium burning ( or hydrogen burning for very low @xmath135 ) initiates a thermonuclear instability and produces a type i x - ray burst . as mentioned in ",
    "[ themodel ] , the hydrogen burning rate is temperature - independent for @xmath239 k and so hydrogen burning can not be thermally unstable for @xmath240 .",
    "since all of the one - zone models give very similar results , we focus on the model of @xcite , which is an extension of the model of @xcite , for a comparison . written in our notation ,",
    "the differential equations ( 1 - 2 ) of @xcite that govern their model are @xmath241 @xmath242,\\ ] ] where @xmath243 .",
    "they presume that @xmath244 and that no stable helium burning occurs prior to the burst .",
    "the equilibrium solution to equations ( [ hcweq1]-[hcweq2 ] ) is @xmath245 or equivalently , @xmath246 where @xmath247 is given by equation ( [ epscooleqn ] ) . using the thin - shell thermal instability criterion of equation ( [ thinshelleqn ] )",
    ", one finds that the transition from stability to instability occurs when @xmath248 , since @xmath249 .",
    "one finds nearly the same condition by performing a standard linear stability analysis on equations ( [ hcweq1 ] ) and ( [ hcweq2 ] ) .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ epsheeqn ] ) , the equilibria are stable to bursts when @xmath250 k. however , figures [ equilibria ] and [ subseteval ] illustrate that many of the equilibria in our two - zone model are stable to thermal perturbations for temperatures much less than @xmath251 k. to understand this , note that equation ( [ he = cool ] ) implies that helium burning is the only source of nuclear energy generation . in our two - zone model , both hydrogen burning and helium burning",
    "are sources of nuclear energy generation , and so qualitatively @xmath252 .",
    "hydrogen burning is temperature - independent , so equation ( [ thinshelleqn ] ) still gives the right criterion for a thin - shell thermal instability .",
    "however , because @xmath253 , the critical value of @xmath254 for instability is larger than @xmath255 .",
    "roughly , on expects something like @xmath256 .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have included the effect of hydrogen burning on the stability criterion in their one - zone models .",
    "these models assume that no helium burning takes place prior to ignition , so @xmath257 throughout the accreted layer .",
    "consequently , they find that the effect of hydrogen burning on the stability of the system is minor .",
    "in contrast , stable helium burning prior to ignition is substantial for @xmath236 in both our two - zone model and that of nh03 , and so the effect of hydrogen burning on the stability of the system is considerable .",
    "thus , hydrogen burning via the temperature - independent hot cno cycle , augmented by the extra cno produced from stable helium burning , helps stabilize nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars even at temperatures @xmath258 k , which is much less than the @xmath259 k needed to stabilize pure helium burning .    in the limit @xmath260 and @xmath261 , equations ( [ dshdteqn]-[dthedteqn ] ) of our two - zone model",
    "reduce to the following set of two coupled differential equations : @xmath262,\\ ] ] @xmath263 + \\frac{{t_{\\mathrm{he}}}}{4 { \\sigma_{\\mathrm{he } } } } { \\frac{d { \\sigma_{\\mathrm{he}}}}{d t}},\\ ] ] where again @xmath264 from equation ( [ fheeqn ] ) , and the equilibrium is given by equation ( [ hcweq ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ limiteqn1 ] ) and ( [ limiteqn2 ] ) are effectively the same as equations ( [ hcweq1 ] ) and ( [ hcweq2 ] ) . with the system of equations ( [ limiteqn1]-[limiteqn2 ] )",
    ", we are able to reproduce the results of the one - zone models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as expected , the critical temperature for stability is @xmath259 k in this case .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that one - zone models that focus only on helium burning are not able to reproduce all of the bursting regimes found using global linear stability analyses or observed in nature .",
    "as we have shown in this paper , one needs at least two zones , one in which only helium burns and another in which both hydrogen and helium burn together , to incorporate all of the key physics included in the model of nh03 .",
    "one - zone models simply do not include enough physics .",
    "more troubling is the fact that the results of detailed multi - zone calculations of type i x - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not reproduce the regime of delayed mixed bursts and are also inconsistent with observations for @xmath236 . since we do not have access to such models , we are unable to conduct a direct comparison between our model and these numerical calculations . however , we attempt to better understand this discrepancy by considering the work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite study the effects of the relatively unconstrained @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne reaction rate on type i x - ray bursts from neutron stars accreting at @xmath265 .",
    "this reaction is one of the two hot cno cycle breakout reactions @xcite . for the lowest of the three trial reaction rates they consider , they find that , after an initial type i x - ray burst , hydrogen and helium burn stably via the hot cno cycle and triple-@xmath3 reactions , respectively , and the nuclear burning generates a slowly oscillating luminosity with a period approximately equal to the hydrogen - burning timescale .",
    "the nuclear burning behavior in this calculation is nearly identical to that of the nuclear burning preceding a delayed mixed burst found in  [ tevolve ] .",
    "this similarity is perhaps to be expected , for the limited reaction networks employed in the model of nh03 and the present model omit hot cno cycle breakout reactions entirely .",
    "for the two higher trial reaction rates investigated by @xcite , the breakout sequence @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne(@xmath266,@xmath7)@xmath267na diminishes the cno abundance and thus reduces the rate of hydrogen burning .",
    "hence , when helium ignition commences , the helium energy generation rate dominates the total nuclear energy generation rate , and a prompt type i x - ray burst occurs via a thin - shell thermal instability .",
    "we tentatively suggest that the discrepancies between the results of the global linear stability analysis of nh03 and the results of multi - zone calculations arise from differences in the treatment of hot cno cycle breakout reactions . in the nh03 model and our two - zone model , hydrogen burning via",
    "the temperature - independent hot cno cycle helps stabilize nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars .",
    "breakout reactions would reduce the degree to which hydrogen burns via the hot cno cycle and thereby increase the temperature - sensitivity of the total effective nuclear energy generation rate .",
    "thus , breakout reactions would presumably extend the range of accretion rates in which nuclear burning is thermally unstable , but we do not include these reactions . that observations agree much better with the results of nh03 and our two - zone model may imply that the true cross sections of reactions such as the hot cno cycle breakout reactions @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne and @xmath268ne(@xmath3,@xmath266)@xmath269na are much smaller than the cross sections employed in the reaction networks of multi - zone models , i.e. , the true @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne reaction rate is closer to the lowest reaction rate considered by @xcite . by omitting hot cno cycle breakout reactions altogether ,",
    "the model of nh03 is perhaps a better representation of the nuclear burning that precedes type i x - ray bursts than time - dependent multi - zone models as presently implemented .",
    "the model we present in  [ themodel ] is valid only when @xmath270 , which restricts the range of accretion rates we can study to @xmath271 .",
    "we have constructed a similar model to determine the stability of nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars for which @xmath272 , allowing us to study the stability of nuclear burning at higher @xmath135 .",
    "although we find that all equilibria for @xmath273 are stable , which is consistent with the results of nh03 , we can not state with confidence that either the two - zone model or the model of nh03 is an accurate representation of nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars for such high accretion rates . for @xmath274 , nuclear reactions other than the hot cno cycle and triple-@xmath3 reaction almost certainly play a significant role in the nuclear burning prior to a type i x - ray burst .",
    "it is possible that there exists another unstable burning regime near @xmath275 , and the range of @xmath135 in which this regime might exist would probably depend upon the @xmath135 at which the effective hydrogen - burning rate becomes predominantly temperature - dependent rather than composition - dependent .",
    "while most low - mass x - ray binaries with @xmath273 do not have type i x - ray bursts , gx 17 + 2 and cyg x-2 are notable exceptions @xcite , although these sources may exhibit type i x - ray bursts for other reasons .",
    "for example , bursts could occur at @xmath275 if the accreted plasma is hydrogen - deficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have constructed a simple two - zone model of type i x - ray bursts on accreting neutron stars .",
    "this model reproduces the delayed mixed burst regime of nh03 as well as the helium and prompt mixed burst regimes of previous studies ( fujimoto et  al .",
    "1981 ; fushiki & lamb 1987 ; cumming & bildsten 2000 ; nh03 ) , and it agrees well with observations of type i x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the model illustrates the physics of the onset of instability as a function of the local accretion rate @xmath21 , and it facilitates comparisons between global linear stability analyses ( which are more accurate but difficult to understand physically ) and other burst models .",
    "a pure , rapidly growing thermal instability in the helium - burning zone triggers bursts at relatively low @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath21 increases above @xmath276 , the trigger mechanism evolves from that of a thermal instability to that of a slowly growing overstability involving all parameters , particularly the cno mass fraction @xmath68 of the hydrogen - burning zone . the competition between nuclear heating via the @xmath2-limited cno cycle as well as the triple-@xmath3 process and radiative cooling via outward diffusion of photons coupled with radiation from the stellar surface drives oscillations with a period approximately equal to the hydrogen - burning timescale @xmath277 .",
    "if these oscillations grow in time , the temperature @xmath70 at the base of the helium layer will rise , eventually triggering a thin - shell thermal instability and hence a delayed mixed burst . for @xmath278 radiative",
    "cooling from the stellar surface dampens the overstability , and no bursts occur .",
    "we consider our two - zone model to be `` minimal , '' by which we mean that no model consisting of only a proper subset of the five time - dependent variables @xmath55 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath56 , and @xmath70 is able to reproduce the phenomenon of delayed mixed bursts .",
    "nearly all other theoretical models predict that bursts should occur for all @xmath279 , in disagreement with the results of both nh03 and the two - zone model , as well as with observations .",
    "we suggest that this discrepancy arises from the assumed strength of the hot cno cycle breakout reaction @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne @xcite in time - dependent multi - zone burst models . that observations agree much better with the results of both nh03 and",
    "this work may imply that the true @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne cross section is much smaller than the cross sections employed in the reaction networks of these models .",
    "further calculations such as those presented by @xcite in which the @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne reaction rate in the networks of time - dependent multi - zone models is varied should be performed .",
    "we have considered only two forms of nuclear burning in our model : hydrogen burning via the hot cno cycle and helium burning via the triple-@xmath3 process . while this simplification is almost surely reasonable for studying the onset of helium bursts",
    ", certain additional reactions may be important in the delayed mixed burst regime or at yet higher @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , hot cno cycle breakout reactions such as @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne could significantly affect the cno metallicity @xmath68 of the hydrogen burning zone and consequently have some effect on delayed mixed bursts .",
    "additional hydrogen burning processes that could circumvent the hot cno cycle such as the @xmath6o(@xmath266,@xmath7)(@xmath280)@xmath281o(@xmath266,@xmath7)@xmath282f(@xmath266,@xmath7)@xmath268ne(@xmath280)@xmath268f(@xmath266,@xmath3)@xmath6o reaction sequence @xcite could affect delayed mixed bursts as well .",

    "<S> we suggest that this discrepancy arises from the assumed strength of the hot cno cycle breakout reaction @xmath6o(@xmath3,@xmath7)@xmath8ne in these other models . that observations agree much better with the results of narayan & heyl and our two - zone model , both of which neglect breakout reactions , </S>",
