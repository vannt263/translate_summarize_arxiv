    "in the present paradigm of galaxy evolution , most galaxies which form a bulge also form a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in their nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the central smbh seems to play a fundamental role in the galaxy evolution and cosmological simulations without considering the presence of a smbh and its associated feedback predict masses for the galaxies much higher than those observed @xcite . in a scenario of co - evolution of the smbh and its host galaxy , mass accretion to the central region of the galaxy",
    "leads to the growth of the galaxy bulge , while the feeding of the smbh triggers episodes of nuclear activity which results in feedback in the form of radiation pressure and mass ejections from the accretion disk surrounding the smbh .",
    "this episodic feedback may halt the mass accretion to the galaxy preventing its growth in the active phase @xcite .",
    "this co - evolution may be the mechanism which leads to the empirical relation between the mass of the smbh and the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge @xmath11 , [ @xcite ; but see also @xcite ] .",
    "the @xmath11 relation has been extensively used to estimate the mass of smbhs from the stellar kinematics , as direct determinations for the smbh masses only are possible for the closest galaxies for which the radius of influence of the smbh can be resolved ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "although allowing to estimate the masses of the smbhs for a large number of galaxies , the use of the @xmath11 relation requires the measurement of @xmath0 , which is not always easy to obtain , particularly in active galaxies , where the agn continuum dilutes the stellar absorption lines . in order to overcome this difficulty , a number of scaling relations using the width and luminosities of emission lines to determine @xmath16 have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . nevertheless , most of these relations are for the optical domain of the electromagnetic spectrum . with the improvement of infrared ( ir ) detectors , ir spectra of many agns",
    "have become recently available , and have the advantage of being less affected by reddening than optical spectra . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of using the widths of emission lines in the near - ir as proxies for @xmath0 .",
    "recent studies by our group , using near - infrared ( hereafter near - ir ) integral field spectroscopy of active galaxies , have allowed the mapping of the flux distributions and kinematics of the molecular ( h@xmath6 ) and ionized gas .",
    "we have found , in particular , that the h@xmath6 usually shows small velocity dispersions and a velocity field dominated by rotation , while the ionized gas shows higher velocity dispersions and is not dominated by rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematics and flux distributions are also consistent with a location for the h@xmath6 gas in the galaxy plane , while the ionized gas , and , in particular [ feii ] extends to high galactic latitudes . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the correlation between the gas and stellar kinematics derived from near - ir spectroscopy , with the goal of looking for a  proxy  for @xmath0 among the brightest emission lines in this wavelength range .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 , we describe the sample and the observational data ; in section  3 we describe the methods used to measure the stellar and gaseous velocity dispersion .",
    "the results are presented in section  4 and discussed in section  5 , while the conclusions are shown in section  6 .",
    "the spectroscopic data used in this work are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sample comprises 47 active galaxies with a range of activity types , and the spectra cover , on average , the inner 300pc radius of the galaxies .",
    "the near - infrared spectra were obtained with the nasa 3 m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) , using the spex spectrograph in the short cross - dispersed mode ( sxd , 0.8 - 2.4@xmath17 m ) .",
    "the detector employed was a 1024@xmath181024 aladdin 3 insb array with a spatial scale of 0.15\" / pixel . a 0.8@xmath1815  slit was used and the spectral resolution is 300  kms@xmath19 , obtained from the measurement of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of arc lamp lines , or 127  kms@xmath19 in @xmath1 .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures . for more details on the instrumental configuration , data reduction , calibration processes and details of the extraction of the spectra",
    "see @xcite .    the above sample was chosen for this work because it is an unique dataset of near - ir spectroscopy of active galaxies , observed with the same instrumental setup ( thus with no instrumental bias ) , covering the near - ir z , j , h and k bands , and including several emission and absorption features allowing the comparison of the stellar and gas kinematics .",
    "in order to obtain the gaseous velocity dispersion @xmath1 , we fitted the emission - line profiles of [ siii]@xmath2 m , [ feii]@xmath3 m , [ feii]@xmath4 m and h@xmath5 m by single gaussian curves and adopted as the measured velocity dispersion the @xmath1 of the gaussian .",
    "these emission lines have been chosen because they are the strongest in the near - ir spectra of active galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we excluded the h and he recombination lines due to uncertainties in the fit for type 1 objects , for which is not always easy to separate the narrow from the broad components .",
    "the fitting of the emission - line profiles was done by adapting the profit routine @xcite , which outputs the emission - line flux , the centroid velocity , the velocity dispersion and the uncertainties for each of these parameters .",
    "the velocity dispersion was then corrected for the instrumental @xmath20127  kms@xmath19 , which was subtracted in quadrature from the @xmath1 obtained from the fit of the gaussians to the line profiles .",
    "we measured the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) using the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite in order to fit the co absorptions bands at @xmath21 m in the k - band .",
    "the ppxf method requires the use of stellar spectra as templates .",
    "we used for this the spectra of 60 late - type stars , 40 of them from the gemini near - ir late - type stellar library @xcite and the remaining 20 spectra are from stars with public nifs observations in the gemini data archive ( diniz et al .",
    ", 2012 in preparation ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the measurements of @xmath0 were estimated using 100 monte - carlo iterations as in @xcite .    in order to illustrate our procedures ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fit ] sample fits of the co absorption band heads at 2.3@xmath17 m using the ppxf method , as well as fits of the emission - line profiles using profit for the spectrum of the galaxy ngc5929 .",
    "the resulting measurements for the stellar and gas velocity dispersions for the galaxies of our sample are shown in table  [ table ] .",
    "the dashes in the table are due to the fact that for a few objects we were not able to measure one or more values due to the absence of the absorption / emission lines or due to a low signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "a cautionary note is the observation of recent spatially resolved studies ( e.g. our previous studies already mentioned ) that the [ feii ] emission originates at least in part in outflowing gas .",

    "this will be possible only when more near - ir agn spectra become available , and the equations  [ msigfe ] and [ msigfe_ub ] could be better calibrated using large non - biased samples of galaxies .    on the other hand , when applying the @xmath53}$ ] relation to distant galaxies , it will be hard to ascertain a hubble type to such galaxies , and it will probably better to just use the relation for the whole sample ( equation  [ msigfe ] ) , in spite of the fact that a relation for restricted hubble types ( e.g. , for galaxies without bars ) shows less scatter .    many present / future missions are discovering / will discover large numbers of obscured agn , such as the wise mission + ( @xmath54 ) or the vista variables in the via lactea survey + ( @xmath55 ) , which are potential samples to benefit from the relation we have found in order to obtain the smbh masses , if [ feii ] emission lines are present in the spectra .",
