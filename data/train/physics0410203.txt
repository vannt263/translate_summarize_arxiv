    "when fully relativistic effects are considered in the particle motion , the dispersion relation exhibits unique features which , to our knowledge , have not been discussed before .",
    "we then outline the numerical strategies we are currently considering to examine the consequences of such features .",
    "we assume that the electron - positron plasma is described by the following set of equations : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density of each fluid , @xmath9 is the bulk velocity of each fluid , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electric and magnetic fields , respectively , @xmath12 is the total current , @xmath13 is the particle mass , and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",

    "we want to numerically solve the dispersion relation , which is equivalent to simultaneously solving the set of equations , and . for an electron positron plasma , @xmath28 .",
    "we define @xmath29 normalized equations , and , are @xmath30 where the upper ( lower ) sign in is for positrons ( electrons ) .",

    "fig .  [ fig_disprel ] shows that , for a given frequency @xmath51 , the existence of alfvn waves and the number of wave modes depend on the physical parameters of the plasma .",
    "this poses a number of new questions .",
    "for instance , we could consider the problem of normal incidence of a plane wave on a density interface . in the usual problem of a light wave in a dielectric medium",
    ", only one mode exists for a given frequency .",
    "given only the boundary conditions that the fields must satisfy , it is possible to completely solve the problem and obtain explicit solutions for the field amplitude at both sides of the interface .",
    "however , now several modes exist for a given frequency . moreover , if an alfvn wave exists with a given frequency in one side of the interface , then if the density is small enough on the other side it could not exist .",
    "does it become an evanescent wave ?",
    "is it converted to other modes ?    in order to investigate this",
    "we are studying the system by means of a fluid simulation , and by direct time integration of the evolution equations .    for the fluid simulation",
    ", we notice that the system equations lead to the following wave equations for the electromagnetic field : @xmath52    the wave equations for the fields and , and the momentum equation , are discretized using time - centered and space - centered finite differences .",
    "the second approach we are developing is time integration of the evolution equations - by means of the rationalized runge - kutta method .",
    "both procedures are under development / testing .",
    "a particularly simple problem is that of a pure alfvn mode propagating in a relativistic plasma . since in a pair plasma",
    "there is no harmonic generation , all oscillatory fields and velocities are purely transverse .",
    "we are currently working to obtain satisfactory results for this problem , in order to later consider incidence on a normal interface , where longitudinal oscillations may not be neglected .",
    "propagation of a finite amplitude alfvn wave in an electron - positron plasma has been studied .",
    "full relativistic effects on the particle velocities in the wave field have been considered .",
    "the dispersion relation for propagation along a constant magnetic field has been obtained and numerically solved .",
    "several features are different to the usual nonrelativistic result [ fig .",
    "[ fig_disprel](a ) ] . in the nonrelativistic case ,",
    "there are two branches , an alfvn wave and a light wave .",
    "the light wave has a low frequency cutoff at the frequency @xmath41 , and the alfvn wave has a high frequency cutoff at the positron gyrofrequency , @xmath53 .",
    "however , in the relativistic case the light wave branch does not have a low frequency cutoff .",
    "as to the other branch , there are two alfvn wave modes for any given frequency , and there is a high wavenumber cutoff at @xmath54 . besides , the high frequency cutoff for the alfvn wave depends on the plasma parameters . for large amplitude wave or small plasma density , the alfvn branch is constrained to a small region of frequencies and wavenumbers [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_disprel](c ) ] .",
    "we intend to investigate the behavior of the system when a relativistic alfvn wave of frequency @xmath51 propagates through a pair plasma , and then finds a region where plasma parameters are such that such wave can not propagate .",
    "the existence of more normal modes than in the usual nonrelativistic problem make this a nontrivial matter . as a first example",
    ", we are considering the simple problem of normal incidence of an alfvn wave on a planar density discontinuity .",
    "two approaches are being developed , namely a fluid simulation , and time integration of the evolution equations .",
    "work on this is in progress , and we expect to present results elsewhere .",
    "it is worth noting that for waves in the high - wavenumber end of the alfvn branch in fig .",
    "[ fig_disprel ] , particles have large lorentz factors , and therefore synchrotron radiation emission will be important . thus , the results presented here may be further modified when additional effects such like synchrotron loss are taken into account ."
