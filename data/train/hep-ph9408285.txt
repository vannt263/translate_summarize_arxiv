    "a dynamical system exhibits _ ergodic _ behavior , if the time average of an observable @xmath4 can be replaced by the phase space average @xmath5 @xmath6 here denotes the _ microcanonical _ average , @xmath7 is the microcanonical partition function , and @xmath8 is the phase space measure at constant energy . for systems with very many degrees of freedom",
    "it is equivalent to take the _ canonical _ average @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] is the canonical partition function and the inverse temperature @xmath11 is determined by the condition @xmath12 .    for practical applications",
    "it is crucial to know the time scale on which ergodicity is attained .",
    "it can be shown that this time scale is related to the rate @xmath13 of exponential divergence of neighboring trajectories in phase space ; this rate is called the ( maximal ) lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "the complete spectrum of lyapunov exponents is defined as follows .",
    "consider a given trajectory in phase space , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 enumerates the degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath14 is a solution of the classical equations of motion of the system .",
    "now take a set of neighboring trajectories ( see figure 1 ) : @xmath16    # 1#20.8#1    for infinitesimal @xmath17 they are solutions of a second - order linear differential equation of the form @xmath18",
    "\\delta x_{\\alpha}^{(i)}(t ) = 0.\\ ] ] one can then obtain a complete orthogonal set of solutions of this equation ; they define @xmath19 lyapunov exponents @xmath20 according to @xmath21 in other words , for long times one has the norm of @xmath22 growing ( or shrinking ) as @xmath23 .",
    "one usually assumes the lyapunov exponents to the ordered in size : @xmath24 for conservative ( hamiltonian ) systems the lyapunov exponents occur in pairs of equal size , but opposite sign : @xmath25 .",
    "this is in accordance with liouville s theorem which states that the volumes in phase space filled by an ensemble remains unchanged with time , implying that there must be a direction of contraction for every direction in which the phase space volume expands . for each conservation law",
    "there occur two vanishing lyapunov exponents ; the conservation of energy always ensures the existence of one such pair for a hamiltonian system . since the extent of the ensemble rapidly shrinks below any practially achievable resolution in the exponentially contracting directions , the _",
    "observable _ volume in phase space grows as @xmath26 where the sum only includes the positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "the exponential growth rate of the observable phase space volume implies a _ linear _ rate of growth of the observable `` coarse - grained '' entropy associated with the ensemble .",
    "this rate , @xmath27 , is called the kolmogorov - sinai entropy , or short , ks - entropy .",
    "dynamical systems that have a positive ks - entropy everywhere in phase space are called k - systems ; they exhibit all the properties required for a statistical description on time scales that are long compared with the ratio between the equilibrium entropy @xmath28 and the ks - entropy , i.e. for times @xmath29 an illustration of these properties is provided by the simple dynamical system @xmath30 which occurs as part of the extreme infrared limit of yang - mills fields @xcite .",
    "the system described by the hamiltonian ( 8) has a positive lyapunov exponent @xmath31 .",
    "almost all its trajectories are unstable against small perturbations @xcite and the analogous quantum system has been shown to exhibit a wigner distribution of its level spacings @xcite . the remarkable ability of this system to randomize an initially localized phase space distribution is shown in figure 2 .",
    "after a rather limited time the phase space distribution is indistinguishable from a microcanonical ensemble .    #",
    "1#21.15#1    -.5truein",
    "if we want to apply these concepts to nonabelian gauge theories , we must consider these as classical hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom , and we need a gauge invariant distance measure in the space of field configurations .",
    "the first part is easy ; the hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory by kogut and susskind can form the basis for a study for the gauge group su(@xmath32 ) of nonabelian gauge theories as dynamical systems .",
    "the lattice hamiltonian is expressed as ( @xmath33 denotes the lattice spacing ) @xmath34 where electric field strength @xmath35 and the link variables @xmath36 are defined on the lattice links , and @xmath37 denotes the ordered product of the @xmath36 around an elementary plaquette @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath36 are elements of the gauge group ( su(3 ) in the case of qcd ) and the @xmath35 are elements of the associated lie algebra . in the classical limit ,",
    "the link variables @xmath36 are functions of time , and the electric field variables are given by @xmath39 the hamiltonian equations then provide a set of coupled equations for the time evolution of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which can be integrated numerically .",
    "we have taken great care to ensure a numerically exact solution .",
    "the energy and gauss law remain conserved to better than @xmath42 over the whole course of the numerical integration .",
    "an appropriate measure for the distance between two field configurations is @xcite @xmath43 = { 1\\over 2n_p } \\left ( a^2 \\sum_{\\ell}\\left\\vert { \\rm tr } ( e_{\\ell}e_{\\ell}^{\\dagger } ) - { \\rm tr } ( e_{\\ell}^{\\prime}e_{\\ell}^{\\prime\\dagger})\\right\\vert + \\sum_p \\left\\vert { \\rm tr}\\ ; u_p- { \\rm tr}\\ ; u'_p\\right\\vert\\right).\\ ] ] it is gauge invariant , gives a vanishing distance between gauge equivalent field configurations , and goes over into @xmath44 \\propto { 1\\over 2v } \\int d^3x \\left ( \\vert e^2-e'^2\\vert + \\vert b^2-b'^2\\vert\\right)\\ ] ] in the continuum limit , measuring the local differences in the electric and magnetic field energy.$ ] . ]",
    "if one starts from two randomly chosen neighboring field configurations and integrates these in time , one finds that the distance quickly grows exponentially , until it saturates due to the compactness of the space of gauge fields .",
    "the growth rate @xmath13 quickly reaches a constant limit as function of the lattice size @xmath45 , if the energy density is kept fixed by choosing the same average energy per plaquette @xmath46 in each case .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 3 for lattices of size @xmath47 up to @xmath48 and the gauge group su(2 ) .    #",
    "1#20.4#1    it is easy to see@xcite that the hamiltonian ( 9 ) exhibits a scaling behavior such that the lyapunov exponents , if they are universal functions of the average energy density , as expressed by @xmath46 , can only depend on the dimensionless scaling variable @xmath49 .",
    "the nontrivial surprise is that , as shown in figs .",
    "4a , b , the dependence is linear @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the linear relationship means that the lattice spacing drops out , yielding @xmath53 independent of @xmath33 .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent hence has a well - defined continuum limit .    #",
    "1#20.85#1    what about the other lyapunov exponents ?",
    "their calculation for large lattices is prohibitively expensive , as there are in total @xmath54 degrees of freedom for su(@xmath32 ) gauge theory on a @xmath45 lattice , but gong @xcite has evaluated the complete spectrum for su(2 ) on lattices of size @xmath55 , and 3 .",
    "the result again is a surprise : when the lyapunov exponents are scaled by the maximal one , and are plotted on the interval @xmath56 $ ] , the spectra for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are indistinguishable , and there is only a small difference between @xmath59 and @xmath57 ( see figure 5 ) .    # 1#20.4#1    the lyapunov spectrum for su(2 ) shows three separate components : there are @xmath60 positive and negative exponents each , and there are @xmath61 exponents that converge to zero in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "their vanishing reflects the existence of @xmath63 conservation laws : gauss law at every lattice point and the overall energy conservation .",
    "since the density of points on the line over the fixed interval [ 0,1 ] grows as @xmath45 , this implies that the sum over positive lyapunov exponents increases like the volume of the lattice , yielding a constant _ ks - entropy density _ @xmath64 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "gong finds @xmath65 which together with ( 14 ) and the lattice volume @xmath66 yields @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the average energy density on the lattice .",
    "( note that there are @xmath69 plaquettes . )",
    "no one has yet calculated the complete lyapunov spectrum for su(3 ) , but i expect a similar relationship as ( 15 ) to hold in that case , too .",
    "the coefficient @xmath70 is not completely independent of the scaling variable @xmath49 , but has a value around 2 .",
    "we will return below to the question how the physically relevant value of @xmath49 can be chosen .",
    "the instability of all degrees of freedom of the nonabelian gauge field ( in the classical limit ) leads to a very rapid `` thermalization '' of the energy density on the lattice .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 6 showing the distribution of magnetic energy on the lattice plaquettes @xcite .",
    "the initial state was chosen according to a random ( not thermal ) distribution of lattice link variables with vanishing electric field everywhere . within two lattice units ( @xmath71 )",
    "the energy has been equilibrated between electric and magnetic fields and , as the exponentially falling distribution shows , has assumed the form of a gibbs distribution .",
    "the time scale for this `` thermalization '' is in good agreement from the time scale estimated from the inverse of the maximal lyapunov exponent which is @xmath72 in lattice units in su(3 ) at this energy density .    #",
    "1#20.4#1    the fact that the energy density thermalizes on a time scale much shorter than that required for the numerical determination of the lyapunov exponents ( typically @xmath73 ) allows us to relate the lyapunov exponents to quantities in the presence of a thermal environment .",
    "first , we can replace the average energy per plaquette @xmath46 in ( 13 ) by the `` temperature '' @xmath74 , because @xmath75 for the classical , equilibrated su(@xmath32 ) gauge field .",
    "this implies that @xmath76 we can use this result to obtain a model independent , nonperturbative estimate of the thermalization time solely due to gauge field dynamics in qcd . to compensate for the lack of `` running '' of the gauge coupling constant in the context of our classical gauge field calculation",
    ", we may use the one - loop result for @xmath77 in ( 17 ) to evaluate @xmath78 , as shown in figure 7 .",
    "clearly , this time is much smaller than 0.5 fm / c for all relevant temperatures , indicating a very rapid thermalization of the available energy .",
    "one should note that the lyapunov exponents usually approach their asymptotic values from _ above _ , i.e. the dynamical instabilities are actually greater before the energy has been completely thermalized .",
    "this indicates that thermalization of field configurations far away from equilibrium may proceed even more rapidly .    #",
    "1#20.55#1    it first appeared as a remarkable coincidence that the maximal lyapunov exponents for su(2 ) and su(3 ) agree within numerical errors with the analytically calculated damping rate of a nonabelian plasmon at rest @xcite : @xmath79 [ the reason for the factor 2 is that the plasmon pole is usally parametrized as @xmath80 , so that the energy density of the soft plasmon mode falls off as exp ( @xmath81 ) . ]",
    "the observation that the lyapunov exponent is numerically evaluated in the vicinity of a `` thermalized '' field configuration over time scales that are much longer than those of thermal fluctuations allows us to establish a connection between these two quantities . according to ( 4 ) the lyapunov exponents are determined from the long time behavior of solutions of the linearized equation for the fluctuation @xmath82 around an exact solution @xmath83 of the yang - mills equations . in the continuum limit",
    "this equation reads : @xmath84 = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath85 denotes the gauge covariant derivative and @xmath86 $ ] denotes the lie algebra commutator .",
    "equation ( 19 ) is the usual starting point for quantization in a background field , but we will _ not _ impose here the background gauge constraint @xmath87 . the initial value problem for ( 19 ) can be solved by means of the retarded propagator schwinger function in the background field .",
    "@xmath88 @xmath89 has the formal representation as difference between the causal and the anticausal propagator : @xmath90\\ ] ] now recall that the maximal lyapunov exponent is obtained from the long time average of the growth rate of @xmath91 . assuming ergodicity , we may therefore replace the long - time average of the propagators by the canonical , i.e. thermal , average : @xmath92\\ ] ] where @xmath93 denotes the _ exact _ finite temperature feynman propagator of the gauge field .",
    "note that the causal feynman propagator describes damped fluctuations , the anti - causal propagator @xmath94 describes exponentially growing perturbations .",
    "the only remaining obstacle before establishing the equivalence of @xmath13 and @xmath95 is that the thermal average in ( 22 ) should be calculated for a _ classical _ emsemble of gauge fields , whereas the usual perturbative approach to @xmath93 is based on the quantum mechanical ensemble .",
    "however , this difference turns out to be irrelevant for the plasmon damping rate @xmath96 , although it has a large effect on the effective plasmon mass @xmath97 .",
    "this is not entirely fortuitous , because the damping rate is given by tree diagrams , such as compton scattering and bremsstrahlung , that have an exact low - energy classical limit @xcite .",
    "we can therefore identify the maximal lyapunov exponent with ( twice ) the damping rate of the most unstable mode in a thermal nonabelianplasma , which turns out to be a plasmon at rest @xcite .",
    "the short thermalization time scales of less than 1 fm / c found in our studies of the time evolution of classical nonabelian gauge fields show why hagedorn was right thirty years ago with his assumption that final states in `` soft '' strong interaction physics are populated statistically .",
    "the reason for the success of these classical studies is that the dynamical instabilities in thermal gauge theories are of order @xmath98 , which is a classical inverse length or time scale that does not involve @xmath99",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether other quantities of order @xmath98 , such as the thermal magnetic screening mass on the `` spatial '' string tension , can also be calculated in the framework of classical yang - mills theory .",
    "this immediately leads to the problem of deriving an effective quasi - classical theory for thermal yang - mills theories at the length scale @xmath100 that consistently incorporates quantum effects from shorter distances in the form of transport coefficients .",
    "presumably such an effective theory will contain a gauge invariant mass term of order @xmath101 ( as in the taylor - wong action ) and a langevin noise term describing the fluctuations due to interactions with hard thermal modes .",
    "another interesting problem concerns the application of real - time evolution of gauge fields to processes far off equilibrium as they occur in the earliest stage of hadron - hadron or nucleus - nucleus interactions .",
    "we have recently studied the instability of the superposition of two counter - propagating plane waves , i.e. of a standing abelian plane wave , in su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite . here",
    "one finds that the lyapunov exponent is proportional to the _ amplitude _ of the wave , not to the energy as it is the case in random fields .",
    "once the coherent wave is only slightly perturbed it decays rapidly , exciting modes of all wavelengths , and quickly generates a thermal energy spectrum ( see figure 8) .",
    "the evolution of more realistic initial configurations , such as the interaction between nonabelian wave packets , is presently under investigation .    #",
    "i thank t. s. bir , c. gong , s. g. matinyan and a. trayanov for their enthusiastic help in unraveling the intricacies of chaotic dynamics in gauge theories .",
    "i would also like to thank d. egolf , h. b. nielsen , s. e. pugh , and g. k. savvidy for illuminating discussions .",
