    "phase mixing and violent relaxation are important dynamical phenomena , relevant in the astrophysical contest ( [ lynden - bell , 1967 ] , [ binney & tremaine , 2008 ] ) .",
    "in fact @xmath3-body simulations revealed that the final states of gravitating systems experiencing a collapse from _ cold _ and _ clumpy _ initial conditions are structurally very similar to real elliptical galaxies ( [ van albada , 1982 ] , [ bertin _ et al . _ , 2005 ] , [ nipoti _ et al . _ , 2006 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the phase - space properties of the numerical end - products are remarkably interesting , with a differential energy distribution described very well by an exponential law , over a large value of energy values ( [ binney , 1982 ] , [ bertin & stiavelli , 1984 ] , [ ciotti , 1991 ] ) .",
    "finally , recent investigations of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) showed that relaxation processes are much slower in mond than in newtonian gravity ( [ ciotti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ] , [ nipoti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ] ) .",
    "this fact is relevant here , because in the weak limit mond forces behave qualitatively as @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , mond is a non - linear theory , so that numerical simulations are more difficult than for systems with forces obeying the superposition principle . with this paper",
    "we begin an exploration aimed at understanding how the properties mentioned above depend on the specific nature of long - range ( power - law ) interactions . in particular , we study the relaxation of systems governed by additive @xmath1 forces , focusing on the simplified case of spherical systems .",
    "following previous studies ( [ hnon , 1962 ] , [ takizawa & inagaki , 1997 ] , [ sanders , 2008 ] , [ malekjiani _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ] ) , we numerically integrate the motion of @xmath5 massive spherical shells .",
    "we assume that a surface element of each shell , of mass @xmath6 and at vector position @xmath7 , produces an acceleration at the point @xmath8 given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the `` gravitational '' constant , and the force index @xmath2 , for reasons of convergence , is restricted to @xmath11 ; the case of newtonian gravity is obtained for @xmath12 , while @xmath13 corresponds to the case of harmonic force .",
    "the equations of motion for the shell @xmath14 , of mass @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 , are @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the radial velocity and the ( constant ) angular momentum per unit mass of the shell , and @xmath20 is its effective radial acceleration .",
    "the field per unit mass acting on each surface element of the shell @xmath14 due to the shell @xmath21 at @xmath22 is @xmath23 while @xmath24 is the self - field per unit mass acting on each surface element of the shell @xmath14 ; for @xmath12 the celebrated newton theorems are recovered .",
    "note that @xmath25 can be obtained from @xmath26 by imposing @xmath27 and taking the limit @xmath28 ; the same limit is required to obtain the force in case of shell superposition .",
    "we performed experiments with different values of the exponent @xmath2 , considering both radial collapses ( @xmath29 ) and collapses with @xmath30 .",
    "numerically , when a shell collapses to the origin , the sign of the velocity @xmath18 reverses to positive . as indicators of dynamical relaxation we consider the virial ratio @xmath31 , the differential energy distribution @xmath32 , and the phase - space evolution of the pairs @xmath33 .",
    "we evolved the systems up to 50 dynamical times ( @xmath34 ) , where on dimensional grounds @xmath35 @xmath36 is the total mass of the system , and @xmath37 is the half - mass radius at @xmath38 .",
    "we explored different radial distributions for the initial density profile , noticing that the final products are not strongly dependent on it .",
    "the initial conditions are characterized by a vanishing virial ratio , typical of cold collapses .",
    "the integration scheme ( [ di cintio , 2009 ] ) uses a standard 2@xmath39 order leapfrog algorithm with constant timestep ( e.g. , see [ grubmller _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ] ) .",
    "we first consider the time evolution of the virial ratio @xmath31 . as the density distribution of the system",
    "can be written as @xmath40 the virial function @xmath41 , as here for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the potential energy .",
    "for @xmath45 instead @xmath46 is constant , as for deep - mond forces [ nipoti _ et al . _ ,",
    "( [ binney & tremaine , 2008 ] ) reduces to @xmath47 while the total kinetic energy of the system is @xmath48     for systems with @xmath29 , and different values of the force index @xmath2 ( only bound shells have been considered in the plot ) .",
    "low values of @xmath2 correspond to larger and more long - lasting virial oscillations .",
    "middle and bottom panel : kinetic energy and virial @xmath41 in units of the initial binding energy @xmath49 .",
    "virial theorem and energy conservation show that for cold collapses in absence of escapers , @xmath50 at virialization . ]    as apparent from fig .  1 ,",
    "in purely radial collapses ( and in collapses with @xmath30 , not shown ) , the evolution of the virial ratio shows a violent jump followed by an oscillatory phase , around the equilibrium value 1 .",
    "the violent phase lasts @xmath51 , while the subsequent virial oscillations last considerably longer .",
    "a certain trend with @xmath2 is apparent : as the exponent @xmath2 increases towards 2 ( the force range shortens ) , the peak of the first and of the successive jumps lowers .",
    "remarkably , for the lowest value of @xmath2 explored , ( i.e. , for the forces with the slowest decline with distance ) , the virial oscillations continue for several tens of dynamical times , similarly to what found in numerical simulations in mond collapses .",
    "we interpret this result as a clear trend of the system behavior towards the harmonic oscillator case @xmath13 , when from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) it follows that @xmath52 , so that each shell oscillates independently of the others and no energy exchanges between shells can take place .",
    "it is important to note that the somewhat arbitrary definition of @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is found to be a quite accurate measure of the true dynamical time , as the first peak of the virial ratio occur at @xmath53 for all the explored values of @xmath2 .",
    "the same behavior is also shown by phase - space evolution of the pairs @xmath33 , represented in fig .  2 for systems with @xmath54 and @xmath12 .",
    "in the former case ( top panels ) , the phase - space still presents an ordered structure after @xmath55 , symptom of a less efficient mixing than in the newtonian case ( bottom panels ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of mond systems , and the plots are strikingly similar to those in fig .  2 in [ ciotti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ] .",
    "this finding is also confirmed by experiments with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( not shown ) . from fig .",
    "2 ( bottom panels ) is apparent how shells are lost from the system with @xmath12 ; note that ejection is energetically impossible when @xmath58 .",
    ", @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , for a system with @xmath54 ( top panels ) and @xmath12 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the scale velocity is @xmath61 , while @xmath37 and @xmath34 are defined in sect .  2 .",
    "note how phase mixing and shell ejection are more efficient in the case of newtonian forces . ]    , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath62 is the minimum energy value attained by the shell distribution . ]",
    "we finally present the differential energy distribution at virialization , @xmath32 . the quantity @xmath63 is defined as the number of shells with energy in the range @xmath64 .",
    "the total energy of each shell is @xmath65 where an integration gives the expressions for the potential @xmath66 at @xmath16 due to the shell @xmath21 , and the self - potential , while @xmath67 .",
    "note also that @xmath68 is not the total energy of the system . ]",
    "for @xmath42 @xmath70 while for @xmath71 @xmath72,\\quad { \\phi_{ii}}=g{m_i}\\left ( \\ln{r_i}+\\ln 2 -{1\\over 2}\\right).\\ ] ] the formulae for the self - potential can be obtained by direct integration or by taking @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the expression of @xmath66 .",
    "the final @xmath32 for systems with @xmath73 is shown in fig .",
    "the distributions ( albeit quite noisy , due to the limited number of shells used in the simulations ) roughly reproduce the expected decline with increasing ( absolute ) energy predicted by an exponential function @xmath74 ( [ binney , 1982 ] , [ ciotti , 1991 ] ) . however , the agreement of our results with eq .",
    "( 12 ) , known to provide an excellent fit over a large energy range of the virialized end - products of @xmath3-body simulations of _ cold _ and _ clumpy _ systems , is quite poor .",
    "this is not surprising , as the imposed spherical symmetry of the shells does not allow the additional mixing effects due to non - radial density inhomogeneities .",
    "we conclude by noticing that the case @xmath75 presents a curious , non - monothonic trend with energy ; we verified that this feature is not a numerical artifact .",
    "we stress that also in mond numerical simulations ( that should correspond , in a broad sense , to the low-@xmath2 cases ) the final @xmath32 is very different to that of newtonian simulations starting from the same initial conditions ( see fig .  5 in nipoti _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) .",
    "with the aid of a simplified model of @xmath3 massive , spherically symmetric and concentric shells , moving under the action of long - range , power - law additive forces , we studied the relaxation process leading to the final virialized states .",
    "we find that for all the explored values of @xmath2 the relaxation process involves first a rapid violent relaxation phase , followed by a longer and gentle relaxation due to phase mixing .",
    "for @xmath2 increasing from values @xmath76 to @xmath77 , the relaxation time ( in units of dynamical time ) decreases steadily . in general , systems involving force laws with low @xmath2 have longer mixing times compared to those of systems with high @xmath2 , that are by contrast characterized by faster evaporation , resulting in a well marked core - halo segregation .",
    "this finding can be useful to improve our understanding of mond , where the relaxation mechanisms ( due to the nonlinearity of the theory ) are still quite poorly understood ; in fact , the cases of low @xmath2 present an evolution similar to that of @xmath3-body mond systems .",
    "finally , the @xmath32 distribution of the final virialized states are qualitatively similar ( with one exception ) , increasing for increasing energies , but are not described particulary well by an exponential law ( especially for low @xmath2 ) .",
    "the next step in our study will be the investigation of the relaxation of @xmath3-body systems with interparticle additive forces as in eq .",
    ". one of the main reasons for the successive analysis is to abandon the assumption of spherical symmetry , as it is expected that the increasing number of degrees of freedom will produce a faster relaxation , and a better agreement with an exponential @xmath32 .",
    "also , it will be interesting to investigate how radial orbit instability , characteristic of self - gravitating systems with most particles on radial orbits , depends on the specific nature of the force law .",
    "unfortunately , for generic values of @xmath2 , a field equation for the potential ( such as poisson equation for newtonian gravity , or the @xmath78-laplace equation for mond systems ) does not exists , so that particle - mesh methods can not be used , and only the more time - expensive direct @xmath3-body numerical schemes are available .",
