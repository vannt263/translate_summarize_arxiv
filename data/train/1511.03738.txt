    "given a degree sequence , a fundamental question to ask is whether it is graphic ; that is , does there exist a graph for which the degrees of the nodes are exactly the elements of the sequence ?",
    "a more refined view goes beyond simply considering graphicality as a yes - or - no property and recognizes that there may be very different numbers of graphs that realize different graphic degree sequences .",
    "our main goal in this work is to develop formulas that approximate the numbers of graphs that realize degree sequences with certain properties , which are valid asymptotically as the number of nodes in the degree sequence and in the corresponding graphs goes to infinity .",
    "the problem of counting graphs that realize a given degree sequence can be recast as a problem of counting @xmath14 binary matrices .",
    "specifically , counting the number of rectangular @xmath14 binary matrices with fixed row and column sums is equivalent to counting the number of bipartite graphs with a fixed bidegree sequence . alternatively ,",
    "counting the number of square @xmath14 binary matrices with fixed row and column sums is equivalent to counting the number of directed graphs with loops that realize a given bidegree sequence .",
    "furthermore , since any rectangular @xmath14 binary matrix can be arbitrarily extended to a square @xmath14 binary matrix by adding either rows or columns of @xmath15 , we focus here on square binary matrices .    in terms of applications ,",
    "the aforementioned counting problem is an important step for uniformly generating @xmath14 matrices ( contingency tables ) with fixed row and column sums .",
    "uniform generation of @xmath14 binary matrices has many applications , from detecting statistically significant subgraphs ( motifs ) in a network in data mining @xcite to determining the impact of the degree sequence on emergent dynamics in a network of nodes with temporally varying states @xcite . while the methods proposed for ( almost ) uniformly generating graphs are quite diverse , many ( if not most ) of the methods can be classified into two categories , markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods and sequential importance sampling ( sis ) .",
    "the traditional mcmc method involves swapping edges many times to generate an approximately uniformly random sample .",
    "the main drawback of this method is that there is an unknown mixing time .",
    "naturally , by knowing precise asymptotics for the number of graphs with a prescribed degree sequence , we can deduce asymptotic probabilities for the likelihood two nodes share an edge .",
    "consequently , we could use these asymptotic probabilities as a criteria to empirically help us determine the mixing time .",
    "there are quite a few interesting technical issues for implementing this method and we refer the reader to the literature for details @xcite .",
    "we also mention that there are mcmc methods that have probable bounds for almost uniformly sampling graphs with a prescribed degree sequence , but they are also computationally expensive @xcite .    alternatively , sis methods sample the number of graphs with a prescribed degree sequence in a biased way . a large sample of graphs is taken from a biased distribution and a law of large numbers argument is used to construct a new ( approximately ) uniform distribution based on the output of the biased sampling procedure @xcite .",
    "the biggest drawback of sis is that we often do not know how large a sample of graphs we need from our biased distribution to reliably construct the approximately uniform distribution . indeed ,",
    "past work has shown that certain constraints on degree sequences may be required to ensure the computational efficiency of sis methods @xcite ; without such constraints , an exponentially large sample size may be required to attain meaningful estimates for approximating the uniform distribution @xcite .",
    "statistical arguments show that to increase the speed of convergence , we want an initial biased distribution that is quite close to the uniform distribution @xcite . incorporating asymptotically accurate graph enumeration formulas in constructing a biased distribution",
    "could conceivably improve the performance of such methods .",
    "the derivation of asymptotic formulas for the number of @xmath14 binary matrices with fixed row and column sums has a rich history spanning at least as far back as 1958 with read @xcite .",
    "progress in this area has been made by restricting to matrices that are sparse @xcite , in the sense that row and column sums grow at most as a fractional power of the norm of the matrix or by restricting to matrices that are dense but have limited variation among the row and column sums @xcite .",
    "we focus on the sparse case . in this",
    "setting , mckay @xcite developed a formula to count such matrices that is valid in an asymptotic sense in the limit as the number of edges @xmath3 becomes arbitrarily large , assuming that the maximum row sum or column sum grows as @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , greenhill et al .",
    "@xcite generalized mckay s formula , obtaining a result that holds if the maximum row sum or column sum is @xmath13 .",
    "our motivation for considering this counting problem comes from the construction of directed graphs representing neuronal networks in the analysis of the spread of neural activity in certain brain regions . given that such networks can consist of many thousands of neurons , commonly with connectivities of up to 10 @xmath17",
    ", we aim to count matrices with row and column sums , corresponding to in- and out - degrees , that exceed @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , since we are asymptotically guaranteed graphicality provided that the maximum degree ( row sum or column sum ) is @xmath19 , as demonstrated in @xcite , we expect that we should be able to generalize the above asymptotic formulas to allow for a maximum degree of @xmath19 .    to attain this generality , we initially estimate @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of directed graphs with loops that realize the bidegree sequence @xmath22 , @xmath23 , we stress that while in the statements of the theorems that we will establish , the taxicab norm of the difference of the bidegree sequences , @xmath24 , equals 2 , we can apply the theorems in this work to then estimate @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , by considering a product @xmath27 , where for all @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "( for a rigorous proof that we can construct a sequence of @xmath30 s in this fashion , we refer the reader to a result by muirhead that can be found in @xcite . )",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * in theorem 1 , we derive an expansion for @xmath31 that holds in general for all degree sequences . * in corollary 3 , we exploit the sparsity constraints to prove that the terms in the expansion of @xmath32 based on theorem 1 decrease geometrically . * in corollary 4 , theorem 3 , theorem 4 and theorem 5 , we establish successively finer asymptotic approximations for @xmath20 , allowing errors of size @xmath33 , @xmath34,@xmath35 , and @xmath36 respectively , where @xmath3 is the number of edges in the graph and @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "as we demonstrate in the proofs of theorems 3 and 4 , with more care , the same technique can yield even more refined approximations ; however , such approximations become increasingly cumbersome and are not explicitly presented in this work . * after theorem 3 , we provide a general method that we conjecture can be used to derive higher order approximations up to arbitrary order .",
    "* in section 5 , we show how to construct asymptotics on @xmath31 from the asymptotics computed for @xmath20 . * in appendix a",
    ", we explain how to generalize our results to the case where the product of the maximum in - degree and maximum out - degree is of @xmath38 . * in appendix b , we illustrate how to extend our results to undirected and directed graphs , including the case where loops are prohibited , as well as graphs where we prohibit edges between certain nodes .",
    "we now detail our proof strategy .",
    "first , in section 2 , we use _ matrix partitioning _ , inspired by @xcite , to construct novel expansions for the number of graphs that realize a bidegree sequence .",
    "that is , for a particular realization of a bidegree sequence , we can partition our adjacency matrix into two submatrices , one submatrix containing just the @xmath28th and @xmath39th rows ( or columns ) , and another submatrix containing the remaining @xmath40 rows . in turn , we obtain two  smaller \" bidegree sequences for both of our submatrices . once we demonstrate how to count the number of graphs that realize the smaller bidegree sequence corresponding to the two - row submatrix , we obtain the following expression for @xmath31 in terms of the number of graphs where two arbitrarily chosen nodes @xmath28 and @xmath39 ( with degrees @xmath41,@xmath42 ) have @xmath43 common neighbors : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a ( residual ) bidegree sequence of the @xmath40 remaining rows and @xmath46 is a set of ( residual ) bidegree sequences corresponding to graphs where the @xmath28th and @xmath39th nodes have exactly @xmath43 common neighbors .    next ,",
    "in section 3 , we introduce the idea of _ degree preserving switches _ , as discussed in @xcite in which we make a single edge replacement to eliminate a common neighbor of two nodes without changing any nodes degrees .",
    "counting graphs with common images or pre - images under degree preserving switches allows us to prove that for sparse graphs , the dominant term in the expansion only involves instances where there are no common neighbors between the two nodes @xmath28 and @xmath39 .",
    "that is , in the notation of ( [ eq : prelim ] ) , @xmath47 moreover , it turns out that the set @xmath48 in the prior expression does not change if we consider @xmath49 where @xmath50 except that node @xmath28 in @xmath49 has degree @xmath51 and node @xmath39 has degree @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , we find that @xmath53    a subtlety of the proof is that we first establish the above statement where node @xmath28 or @xmath39 has bounded ( in)-degree .",
    "we then show that the above relationship still holds even for degree sequences that lack a node of bounded degree by using the fact that such degree sequences are very close in taxicab norm to a degree sequence that contains a node of bounded degree .",
    "we then proceed in section 4 by analyzing more refined approximations of @xmath54 , both by considering instances where nodes @xmath28 and @xmath39 can have a nonzero number of common neighbors and also using our previously derived results to construct finer approximations for expressions of the form @xmath55 next , in section 5 , we show how asymptotics for @xmath56 follow from those obtained for the ratio @xmath57 , where @xmath49 is a degree sequence designed such that both this ratio and @xmath58 itself can be estimated .",
    "more precisely , we achieve this result by working with a sequence of intermediary degree sequences , starting from a sequence for which it is easy to compute the number of graphs that realize it and , from there , progressing successively closer to @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we will consider _ bidegree sequences _ , each denoted by @xmath59 , where for concreteness we specify that @xmath8 lists the in - degrees of the nodes in the sequence and @xmath9 the out - degrees .",
    "we are interested in graphs that realize such sequences , where we allow either 0 or 1 connection between each pair of nodes as well as single self - loops within each graph . throughout the paper",
    ", we use @xmath3 to denote the number of edges in the graphs that realize @xmath4 . since we do not need to distinguish between degree sequences and bidegree sequences in this work",
    ", we will henceforth simply refer to these as degree sequences .",
    "in one special case , it is particularly easy to count the number of graphs that realize a specified degree sequence .",
    "[ lem : prelim ] suppose that @xmath60 let @xmath61 denote the number of times @xmath43 appears in @xmath9 and let @xmath62 . if @xmath63 , then there does not exist a graph that realizes this bidegree sequence . if @xmath64 then there are @xmath65 graphs that realize the bidegree sequence .",
    "similarly , if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , with corresponding definitions of @xmath68 and @xmath61 , then there are @xmath69 graphs that realize the bidegree sequence .",
    "we present the proof for the first case , since the second is completely analogous .",
    "we first note that the @xmath61 nodes in @xmath9 with out - degrees equal to @xmath43 must connect to all of the nodes with nonzero degree in @xmath8 . of the @xmath70 remaining outward edges ,",
    "start with the node that corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "there are @xmath70 choices for outward edges that can supply the @xmath72 unconnected inward edges to this node , such that there are @xmath73 possible ways to link this node into the graph .",
    "once these @xmath72 edges have been connected , there are @xmath74 ways to link the node that corresponds to @xmath75 into the graph .",
    "notice that @xmath76 multiplying inductively , the @xmath77 term disappears and we obtain the desired result .",
    "lemma [ lem : prelim ] generalizes immediately to arbitrary permutations of the given @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    with the above lemma in hand",
    ", we can construct an inductive characterization for the number of graphs that realize a specified degree sequence .",
    "first , though , we must define some notation .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the number of graphs that realize a degree sequence @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , for a set @xmath78 of degree sequences , let @xmath79 be the number of graphs that realize any degree sequence in @xmath78 .",
    "now , consider an arbitrary adjacency matrix @xmath80 .",
    "we can write @xmath81 as @xmath82 where for each @xmath28 , @xmath83 .",
    "of course , letting @xmath84 denote a column vector of @xmath85 zeros , we have    @xmath86    call the first and second matrices in this equation @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "now , if @xmath81 realizes a given degree sequence , @xmath89 , then there is a vector @xmath90 such that the degree sequence of ( the graph corresponding to ) @xmath88 is @xmath91 and the degree sequence of @xmath87 is @xmath92 , with the constraint that none of the @xmath93 ( i.e. , the column sums of @xmath88 ) can exceed 2 and the @xmath94 must sum to @xmath95 .",
    "if we know the number of @xmath93 that equal 2 , we can invoke lemma 1 to count the number of realizations of the degree sequence of @xmath91 .",
    "this idea , extended to a partition of the @xmath28th and @xmath39th rows rather than specifically the @xmath96st and @xmath97th rows motivates a useful theorem . to state the theorem",
    ", we define the set of degree sequences @xmath98 note that in equation ( [ eq : xk ] ) , we explicitly represent the positions @xmath99 from which edges will be partitioned out as well as the base degree sequence @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 is a set of degree sequences , even with @xmath4 fixed , because different choices of @xmath102 can be made that fit the definition in ( [ eq : xk ] ) .",
    "the notation @xmath101 is cumbersome and the arguments of @xmath103 will be dropped when possible , but this notation will be needed to make results precise later in the paper .",

    "then @xmath109    any adjacency matrix that realizes @xmath4 can be partitioned into two adjacency matrices as we have discussed . picking any two nodes , with in - degrees denoted by @xmath106",
    ", we note that any realization of our degree sequence @xmath4 must also be a realization of some degree sequence @xmath110 for some @xmath111 , combined with a realization of the degree sequence @xmath112 . in order for @xmath113 to be graphic , we require that @xmath114 ( see lemma 1 ) , hence only graphs that realize degree sequences in @xmath46 for @xmath115 can correspond to our adjacency matrix partition . if @xmath110 for @xmath116 , then lemma 1 implies that the number of graphs that realize @xmath113 is precisely @xmath117 . by multiplying this quantity by the number of graphs that can be generated by the residual degree sequence @xmath118 , namely @xmath119 , and summing over all @xmath46 for @xmath120",
    ", we obtain the desired result .    at this point",
    ", we introduce some additional notation .",
    "the rationale is that we will want to compare numbers of graphs realizing two different degree sequences that are identical except that the in - degrees of two particular nodes in the sequences differ by 1 .",
    "a succint way to think of this relation is to start with a degree sequence @xmath100 for which @xmath121 . now , for any entry @xmath122 in @xmath8 , let @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",

    "to do so , we will need to work with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "but note that since @xmath128 are both defined from the same base sequence @xmath4 and have the same in - degree sum , these two @xmath103 are identical ; hence , we will simply refer to this set as @xmath103 in the proof below , and we will similarly drop the arguments of @xmath103 in most subsequent parts of the paper .",

    "this reasoning implies that there are @xmath495 choices for wirings . in this procedure , however , suppose that all of the choices are the same except for the first two steps . in the first step in one example , node 1 wires with node 2 and node 3 wires with node 4 . alternatively in the other example , node 3 wires up with node 4 in the first step , but node 1 wires up with node 2 in the second step .",
    "the output is the same graph , but we counted both of these instances as two distinct events ( graphs ) .",
    "we readily note that there are @xmath496 possible ways of wiring up the same graph with this procedure , as there are @xmath497 edge pairs in the graph .",
    "the technique for counting the number of undirected graphs with loops for the degree sequence @xmath491 is similar and left as an exercise to the reader . at this juncture",
    "we inform the reader that the idea of prohibiting loops is a special case of prohibiting edges between ( two ) nodes .",
    "though it is outside the scope of this work , the ideas can be extended to attain asymptotics for the ratio of the number of graphs of two distinct degree sequences distance 2 apart where we prohibit edges between certain nodes . as long as generating a prohibited edge is unlikely for any node in the graph , the ideas of our work should carry over ; that is , the dominating term in the ratio will consist of realizations of graphs where the two partitioned nodes do not share a common neighbor and no prohibited edges appear ."
