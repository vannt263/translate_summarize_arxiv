    "neutrino oscillation physics has entered the era of precision measurements with the results from the super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , and kamland @xcite experiments .",
    "especially , impressiver results have recently come from measurements of solar neutrinos ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and the solar neutrino problem has successfully been solved in terms of solar neutrino oscillations .    the solar neutrino day - night effect , which measures the relative difference of the electron neutrinos coming from the sun at nighttime and daytime , is so far the best long baseline experiment that can measure the matter effects on the neutrinos , the so - called mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite . in all accelerator",
    "long baseline experiments , the neutrinos can not be made to travel through vacuum .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino experiments , on the other hand , use different baseline lengths for neutrinos traversing the earth and those that pass through vacuum . with the advent of the precision era in neutrino oscillation physics",
    ", we can gradually hope to obtain better measurements of the day - night effect .",
    "recently , both super - kamiokande and sno have presented new measurements @xcite of this effect that have errors approaching a few standard deviations in significance .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the day - night effect in the three neutrino flavor case .",
    "earlier analyses of this effect , with a few exceptions , have been performed for the two neutrino flavor case .",
    "furthermore , the present data also permit a new treatment of the effect due to the particular values of leptonic mixing angles and neutrino mass squared differences obtained from other experiments",
    ". there are six parameters that describe the neutrinos in the minimal extension of the standard model : three leptonic mixing angles @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath4 , one _",
    "cp_-phase @xmath5 , and two neutrino mass squared differences @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the solar neutrino day - night effect is mainly sensitive to the angles @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and the mass squared difference @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to obtain a relatively simple analytic expression for the day - night asymmetry that reproduces the main features of the situation .",
    "it turns out that one can come a long way towards this goal .",
    "earlier treatments of the day - night effect can be found in refs .",

    "[ sec:3flav ] we study the case of three neutrino flavors , including production and propagation in the sun as well as propagation in the earth . at the end of this section , we present the analytical expression for the day - night asymmetry .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : detectors ]",
    "we discuss the day - night effect at detectors . especially , we calculate the elastic scattering day - night asymmetry at the super - kamiokande experiment and the charged - current day - night asymmetry at the sno experiment .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the possibility of determining the leptonic mixing angle @xmath0 using the day - night asymmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s&c ] we present our summary as well as our conclusions .",
    "finally , in the appendix we shortly review for completeness the day - night asymmetry in the case of two neutrino flavors .",
    "assuming an incoherent neutrino flux @xcite , the @xmath1 survival probability for solar neutrinos is @xmath11 where @xmath9 is the number of neutrino flavors and @xmath12 is the fraction of the mass eigenstate @xmath13 in the flux of solar neutrinos .",
    "from unitarity it follows that @xmath14 in the case of even mixing , i.e. , @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , we obtain @xmath17 .    for neutrinos reaching the earth during daytime ( at the detector site ) ,",
    "@xmath18 is the @xmath1 survival probability at the detector .",
    "however , during nighttime this survival probability may be altered by the influence of the effective earth matter density potential .",
    "thus , in this case , the survival probability becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the length of the neutrino path through the earth .",
    "here , the components of @xmath22 satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath23 with the initial condition @xmath24 and where @xmath25 denotes the mass eigenstate basis .    the hamiltonian @xmath26 is given by ( assuming @xmath27 sterile neutrino flavors ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 , the effective charged - current earth matter density potential is @xmath30 , and the effective neutral - current eath matter density potential is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the fermi coupling constant and where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the electron and nucleon number densities , respectively .",
    "the number densities are functions of @xmath35 depending on the earth matter density profile , which is normally given by the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite . the term @xmath36 is interpreted as the probability of a neutrino reaching the earth in the mass eigenstate @xmath13 to be detected as an electron neutrino after traversing the distance @xmath21 in the earth . for notational convenience",
    "we denote @xmath37 clearly , @xmath38 again , in the case of even mixing , we obtain @xmath39 , and the @xmath1 survival probability is unaffected by the passage through the earth .",
    "until now most analyses of the day - night effect have been done in the framework of two neutrino flavors .",
    "however , we know that there are ( at least ) three neutrino flavors .",
    "the reason for using two flavor analyses has been that the leptonic mixing angle @xmath0 is known to be small @xcite , leading to an approximate two neutrino case .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to find the effects on the day - night asymmetry induced by using a non - zero mixing angle @xmath0 . in what follows",
    ", we assume that there are three active neutrino flavors and no sterile neutrinos .",
    "we will use the standard parametrization of the @xmath40 leptonic mixing matrix @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are leptonic mixing angles , and the elements denoted by @xmath45 do not affect the neutrino oscillation probabilities , which we are calculating in this paper .      in the three flavor framework",
    ", there are a number of issues of the neutrino production and propagation in the sun , which are not present in the two flavor framework .",
    "first of all , the three energy levels of neutrino matter eigenstates in general allow two msw resonances . furthermore , the matter dependence of the mixing parameters are far from as simple as in the two flavor case .",
    "the result of this is that we have to make certain approximations .    repeating the approach made in the two flavor case ( see the appendix ) , we obtain the following expression for @xmath12 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mixing matrix in matter",
    ", @xmath48 is the probability of a neutrino created in the matter eigenstate @xmath49 to exit the sun in the mass eigenstate @xmath13 , and @xmath50 is the normalized spatial production distribution in the sun .",
    "the second resonance in the three flavor case occurs at @xmath51 , assuming that the resonances are fairly separated .",
    "the maximal electron number density in the sun , according to the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite , is about @xmath52 @xmath53/@xmath54 , yielding a maximal effective potential @xmath55 mev . assuming the large mass squared difference @xmath56 to be of the order of the atmospheric mass squared difference ( @xmath57 ev@xmath58 @xcite ) , the neutrino energy @xmath59 to be of the order of @xmath60 mev , and @xmath0 to be small",
    ", we find @xmath61 mev .",
    "thus , the solar neutrinos never pass through the second resonance , independent of the sign of the large mass squared difference .",
    "since the neutrinos never pass through the second resonance , it is a good approximation to assume that the matter eigenstate @xmath62 evolves adiabatically , and thus , we have @xmath63 unitarity then implies that @xmath64 furthermore , if we assume that @xmath65 , the neutrino evolution is well approximated by the energy eigenstate @xmath62 evolving as the mass eigenstate @xmath66 and the remaining neutrino states oscillating according to the two flavor case with the effective potential @xmath67 .",
    "this does not change the probability @xmath68 as calculated with a linear approximation of the potential in the two flavor case .",
    "this means that we may use the same expression as that obtained in the two flavor case , see the appendix , even if the resonance point , where @xmath69 is to be evaluated , does change .",
    "however , in the sun , @xmath33 is approximately exponentially decaying with the radius of the sun , leading to @xmath70 being approximately constant , and thus , independent of the point of evaluation . for the large mixing angle ( lma ) region , the probability @xmath68 of a transition from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , or vice versa , is negligibly small ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , we keep it in our formulas for completeness .    to make one further approximation , as long as the sun s effective potential is much less than the large mass squared difference @xmath74 , the mixing angle @xmath75 giving @xmath76    a general parametrization for @xmath77 and @xmath78 is then given by @xmath79 in the above approximation , the oscillations between the matter eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath72 are well approximated by a two flavor oscillation , using the small mass difference squared @xmath3 , the mixing angle @xmath2 , and the effective potential @xmath67 .",

    "this turns out to be an excellent approximation .    inserting the above approximation into eq .",
    "( [ eq : psn ] ) with @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 when @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 , and thus , we recover the two flavor survival probability in this limit .      as in the case of propagation in the sun , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and",
    "the remaining two neutrino eigenstates evolve according to the two flavor case with an effective potential of @xmath67 . for the msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem along with the assumption that @xmath56 is of the same order of magnitude as the atmospheric mass squared difference",
    ", this condition is well fulfilled for solar neutrinos propagating through the earth . as a direct result",
    ", we obtain the probability @xmath88 as @xmath89 it also follows that @xmath90 where @xmath91 @xmath92 is the electron neutrino potential in the earth , and @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath94 or @xmath95 , @xmath96 just as expected .      now , we insert the analytical expressions obtained in the previous two sections into eq .",
    "( [ eq : psen ] ) with @xmath98 and subtract @xmath18 from this in order to obtain an expression for @xmath99 in the three flavor framework .",
    "after some simplifications , we find @xmath100 for the msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem , @xmath101 , and thus , @xmath102 . this yields @xmath103 apparently , the effect of using three flavors instead of two is , up to the approximations made , a multiplication by @xmath104 as well as a correction in changing @xmath105 to @xmath106 . when @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 , and we regain the two flavor expression in this limit ( see the appendix ) .",
    "an important observation is that the regenerative term , for @xmath109 , is linearly dependent on @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the choice of which value of @xmath92 to use is crucial for the quantitative result .",
    "as is argued in the appendix , the potential to use is the potential corresponding to the electron number density of the earth s crust .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior of the effect of a non - zero @xmath0 is not greatly affected .",
    "from the calculations made in the previous parts of this paper , we obtain the day - night asymmetry of the electron neutrino flux at the neutrino energy @xmath59 as @xmath110 however , this is _ not _ the event rate asymmetry measured at detectors .",

    "the value of @xmath228 is calculated as @xmath229 ^ 2 + k^2 \\sin^2(2\\theta)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath230 is the effective matter density potential .",
    "now , the survival probability @xmath18 takes the simple form @xmath231    for the propagation inside the earth , we make the approximation that the neutrinos traverse a sphere of constant electron number density .",
    "this approximation is motivated by the fact that for current detectors , most neutrinos do not pass through the earth s core .",
    "as long as neutrinos do not pass through the core , the only major non - adiabatic point of the neutrino evolution is the entry into the earth s crust .",
    "as we will see , the regenerative term @xmath232 will oscillate quickly with @xmath21 and give an effective averaging .",
    "it follows that the exact nature of the adiabatic process inside the earth does not matter as it only affects the frequency of the oscillations .",
    "thus , we may use any adiabatic electron number density profile as long as we keep the electron number density at entry into the earth s crust and at detection fixed to the correct values . in this case , the electron number density at entry into the crust and at detection are the same , namely the electron number density in the crust .    keeping the electron number density constant ,",
    "also the effective electron neutrino potential is kept constant at @xmath233 , where @xmath32 is the fermi coupling constant and @xmath33 is the electron number density . exponentiating the hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain the time evolution operator and may calculate the probability @xmath215 .",
    "the result of this calculation is @xmath234 where @xmath235    using the above results , we calculate @xmath145 and obtain the result @xmath236 for the allowed parameter space , the oscillation length in matter is given by @xmath237 m , which is much shorter than the diameter of the earth .",
    "thus , we will have an effective averaging of the term @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2pnd ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath145 contains many expected features .",
    "for example , when @xmath238 then @xmath239 , the oscillation frequency is just the one that we expect , and @xmath239 for @xmath240 reflecting the fact that this corresponds to @xmath241 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2pnd ] ) , we observe that the sign of @xmath145 depends on the sign of @xmath105 , which depends on the point of production . if we suppose that @xmath242 , then from eq .",
    "( [ eq : matangle ] ) we find that @xmath105 is negative if @xmath230 is larger than the resonance potential and positive if @xmath230 is smaller than the resonance potential .",
    "if the production occurs near the resonance , then @xmath105 will be small , since @xmath243 in this case .",
    "for the allowed parameter space , the region of production for @xmath155b neutrinos is such that @xmath230 is larger than the resonance potential , and thus , @xmath105 will be negative .",
    "the same is true for @xmath106 ."
