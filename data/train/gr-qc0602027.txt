    "the computational study of the inspiral of binary black holes is important for the understanding of gravitational wave signals , and is of inherent interest as a question in general relativity that can be answered only with computation .",
    "it has therefore become the focus of supercomputer codes that evolve einstein s field equations forward in time from initial conditions chosen to represent a starting configuration of the inspiralling objects .",
    "the evolution codes , however , typically become unstable on a timescale ( set by the size of the hole ) short compared to a full orbit .",
    "reliable calculations of the final plunge are now feasible@xcite , the merger and ringdown of the final black hole fate of the system are handled well with perturbation theory@xcite , and the early inspiral is well approximated with post - newtonian computations@xcite .",
    "what can not be handled well is the intermediate phase of the inspiral , the late epoch during which nonlinear effects are too strong for a post - newtonian approximation , but for which too many orbits remain for stable numerical evolution .",
    "it has long been recognized that the basis of an approximation scheme should be the slow rate of inspiral , the small ratio of the orbital time to the radiation damping time@xcite . through an adiabatic treatment of the slow inspiral",
    ", such an approximation could give answers about the radiation and rate of inspiral in the intermediate epoch .",
    "in addition , when the rate of inspiral becomes too rapid , the intermediate approximation could hand the problem off to numerical evolution codes to do the final orbit or two and the plunge .",
    "along with the problem being handed off , would be the ideal initial data for the subsequent evolution . the need for and the concept of an intermediate approximation have been clear , but such an approximation has not been easy to implement .",
    "along with several others@xcite we have based an approximation for _ slow _ inspiral on a numerical computation of _ no _ inspiral .",
    "that is , we seek a numerical solution of einstein s equations for binary objects that are in circular periodic motion , and whose `` helically symmetric '' fields rotate rigidly with the source objects .",

    "@xcite . )",
    "the universality of gravitation suggests that the unchanging motion of such a system is not compatible with outgoing radiation , and this intuitive suggestion is confirmed by the mathematics of the theory .",
    "we therefore seek a helically symmetric solution for the sources coupled to standing waves , not to outgoing waves . in a linear theory , standing waves , in the sense that we use the term , are a superposition of half - ingoing and half - outgoing solutions . from the fact that the solution , in linear theory , is half the superposition of the ingoing and outgoing solutions",
    ", one could extract the outgoing solution .",
    "the crux of our periodic standing wave ( psw ) method is that even for highly nonlinear binary inspiral fields there is an `` effective linearity . ''",
    "the standing wave solution , to good accuracy , is half the sum of the outgoing plus ingoing solutions despite the nonlinearities . in general relativity",
    ", therefore , our goal is to solve the standing wave numerical problem and from that solution to extract an approximation to the outgoing solution .",
    "it is important to understand why effective linearity can be correct for inspiral . in the strong - field regions very close to the sources ,",
    "the solution is very insensitive to the choice of distant radiative boundary conditions ( ingoing , outgoing , standing wave ) . in this near - source region",
    "a superposition of half the ingoing and half the outgoing solution gives a good approximation solution , because it amounts to averaging two samples of the same thing .",
    "in the wave zone where the outgoing and the ingoing solutions are very different , the fields are weak enough that nonlinear effects are negligible , and once again we can superpose .",
    "the strong - field region and the boundary - influenced region should be widely separated unless the sources are rotating very close to @xmath0 , in which case the wave zone will start just outside the sources .",
    "it is , however , not expected that ultrarelativistic source motion can occur during the slow inspiral epoch of motion .",
    "we have recently@xcite been able to confirm effective linearity .",
    "this confirmation has been achieved with a model problem , since the validity of effective linearity can only be carried out in a model problem . in general relativity , there can be no `` true outgoing '' solution available for confirmation until numerical evolution codes are fully developed .",
    "in addition , the numerical features of the helically symmetric standing wave calculation pose new challenges very different from those of evolution codes , and are best resolved in the simplest context possible .    the model problem in ref .",
    "@xcite used a nonlinear scalar field theory with a pair of diametrically opposite point - like scalar charges .",
    "the imposition of helical symmetry on the problem leads to a boundary value problem for a system of mixed ( hyperbolic and elliptical ) partial differential equations . to solve that boundary value problem efficiently , a set of numerical techniques",
    "was developed that we called the `` eigenspectral '' method . in the present paper",
    "we report two important steps toward using the psw method for full general relativity : first , we develop the infrastructure for describing gravitational fields . in previous work with scalar toy models helical",
    "symmetry was imposed by simply requiring that the scalar field is a function only of three corotating coordinates ( labels on the killing trajectories ) .",
    "we find it useful to use the expression `` helical scalars '' for such functions that depend only on corotating coordinates .",
    "our computation is done on a grid of corotating coordinates , so straightforward computations can only be carried out for helical scalars . but",
    "complications arise with tensor fields .",
    "the components of a helically symmetric tensor field are generally not helical scalars .",
    "a resolution of this difficulty is to compute only with projections of the tensor on a helically symmetric basis , that is , on a basis that is lie dragged by the helical symmetry .",
    "these projections would be helical scalars . a helically symmetric basis , however , has its own dynamics , and complicates the time dependence of the projected fields . in the infrastructure developed here",
    "we show that the use of a corotating `` pure - spin '' basis leads to a remarkably simple description of helically symmetric tensorial fields . that infrastructure is presented in the explicit context of linearized general relativity .",
    "the second step taken in this paper is to present numerical results showing that no new computational problems are encountered in dealing with the helical scalars of the linearized gravity problem .",
    "since no new problems were anticipated this numerical work simply constitutes a confirmation that the `` eigenspectral method , '' the set of techniques developed for scalar models , appear to work equally well for linearized gravity .",
    "those techniques include the use of ( i )  `` adapted coordinates , '' a corotating coordinate system that conforms well to the source regions and to the radiation field , ( ii )  `` multipole filtering , '' the elimination of numerical noise associated with angular differencing , by keeping only a few multipoles of the adapted coordinates , and ( iii )  the modification of the multipoles so that they are computationally orthogonal at the level of machine precision . in this paper",
    "we provide numerical solutions using this set of techniques . since these solutions differ very little from the numerical problems studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite the presentation of linearized results is brief .",
    "the solutions to nonlinear problems are much more difficult than those for linearized problems .",
    "newton - raphson iteration must be used , and convergence of the iterative process has been the major challenge in numerical work .",
    "again , there is no apparent reason the problem should be more difficult for the tensor - based helical scalars than for the nonlinear scalar models of ref .",
    "nevertheless , it is an issue worth checking , and initial results are briefly reported showing that the scalar techniques work well for a model tensorial problem with a simple toy nonlinearity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : scalar ] gives a brief review of the scalar psw problem in order to introduce adapted coordinates and the application of multipole filtering and the eigenspectral method in those coordinates .",

    "in particular , it is argued that almost all the infrastructure for solving the psw problems in the post - minkowski approximation and in full general relativity problem is probably established in the work with the linearized problem .",
    "the appendix gives some detailed expressions needed for computations in adapted coordinates .    throughout the paper we use units in which @xmath1 and we follow the conventions of misner , thorne and wheeler@xcite",
    "here we review the model problem and numerical techniques of ref .",
    "our model problem was a nonlinear scalar field coupled to point - like sources in minkowski space , and satisfying the field equation @xmath2 in principle , the source was taken to be two points of unit scalar charge in orbit around each other at angular frequency @xmath3 , and at radius @xmath4 . in practice ,",
    "the computational problem used inner boundary conditions on small , approximately spherical surfaces to represent the effect of a point source ; no source term was included in the field equation that was computationally solved .",
    "the velocity parameter for the system @xmath5 was taken to be of order unity , representing the strong - field tight binary for which post - newtonian approximations are inadequate .",

    "the @xmath7 multiplier allowed us to vary the strength of the nonlinear term , and the @xmath11 parameter allowed us to vary the profile of the nonlinearity in the strong field region .",

    "the principal part of this quasilinear equation is elliptic inside a cylinder at @xmath20 , and hyperbolic outside that cylinder .",
    "the problem is to be solved with radiative conditions ( ingoing , outgoing , or standing wave as described below ) on a spherical surface at large distances from the sources .",
    "well posed problems in physics typically supply cauchy data on open surfaces to hyperbolic equations , and dirichlet or neumann data on closed surfaces to elliptic equations .",
    "our model is unusual in that it leads to a boundary value problem with `` radiation '' conditions on a closed surface surrounding a mixed problem .",
    "though unusual , our problem is intuitively well posed , and passes a computational test : we have found no fundamental difficulty in solving models of this type numerically .",
    "furthermore , a careful analysis@xcite proves that solutions exist and are stable for a closely related problem .",
    "`` standing wave '' solutions  half ingoing and half outgoing  are at the heart of our method , but there is not an unambiguous definition of standing wave solutions in a nonlinear theory .",

    "the standing wave solution @xmath27 is fundamentally different from @xmath28 , but if effective linearity is correct , the two are very nearly equal .",
    "( note : in practice , for strong nonlinearities , the direct iteration described above must be replaced by newton - raphson iteration . )    a central idea of the psw approximation is that the `` exact '' ( i.e. , numerical ) solution to the standing wave problem is an excellent approximation to half the sum of the outgoing and ingoing solutions .",
    "if this is so , it means that from the standing wave solution we should be able to extract an excellent approximation to the outgoing and the ingoing solutions .",
    "( it should be noted that this statement is meaningful for nonlinear model field theories in which there is meaning to an outgoing helically symmetric or ingoing helically symmetric solution to the field theory . for general relativity , a helically symmetric spacetime with outgoing radiation",

    "the extraction of the approximate nonlinear outgoing solution from the computed standing wave solution is a direct application of the concepts underlying the argument for effective linearity . in the weak wave zone ,",
    "far from the sources , the field theory is very nearly linear and the solution must be very nearly a standing wave solution to that linear theory .",
    "it is , therefore , straightforward to deconstruct it into outgoing and ingoing solutions .",
    "the extracted outgoing solution can be continued inward through the induction zone into the near - field zone .",
    "if the theory were completely linear , this continuation would be valid up to the source points .",
    "due to the nonlinearity , however , this procedure is no longer valid at distances so close to the source points that the nonlinearity of the theory is important .    in the near field region close to the source points , at a distance small compared to a wavelength , the solution is highly insensitive to the nature of the boundary conditions ( i.e. , whether they are outgoing or ingoing ) . here",
    ", we can use the standing wave solution itself as the outgoing solution .",
    "this near field solution should extend out to the weak field region and overlap with the extracted outgoing solution described above .",
    "these two solutions , the weak field outgoing solution outside the strong field region , and the standing wave solution in the strong field region , are then patched together , with some blending in the region of overlap , and the result is the psw extracted approximation to the nonlinear outgoing solution .      ]",

    "this paper has laid out the infrastructure for describing helically symmetric linearized gravity , and more generally for describing helically symmetric second - rank tensors in a flat background .",
    "the fields have been written in terms of `` helical scalars , ''",
    "i.e. , functions only of corotating coordinates ( equivalently , labels on the curves of the killing congruence ) .",
    "the paper has , furthermore , shown how to formulate computational problems in linearized general relativity in terms of these helical scalars .",
    "the field equations , sources , and inner and outer boundary conditions have been written in this format in sec .  [",
    "sec : descrip ] .",
    "a welcome feature of the formulation in sec .  [ sec : descrip ] is the extent of the separation of `` components '' of the field . in the starting point ,",
    "the lorentz - gauge field equations @xmath305 , a separate equation is satisfied by each component @xmath79 with respect to an inertial minkowski basis . that attractive feature can not be taken over directly to the helically symmetric problem since the components with respect to the inertial basis are not helical scalars .",
    "it turns out , however , that the formulation of the linear problem in helical scalars leads to four real fields @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 , and three complex fields @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 , and that these four real and three complex fields are not mixed by the field equations or the inner or outer boundary conditions .",
    "the only mixing in the problem is between the real and imaginary parts of the complex fields .",
    "since the three corotating coordinates are general , this paper has also presented the explicit formulation of the computational problem in the adapted coordinates that were found in ref .",
    "@xcite to be extremely useful .",
    "the numerical results in sec .",
    "[ sec : numresults ] of the present paper demonstrate that the numerical challenges presented by linearized gravity are the same as those for the linear scalar model in ref .",
    "indeed , the numerical problem for the four real fields is _ exactly _ the same as that for the linear scalar field . for the complex fields , the new features are minor modifications of the boundary conditions and mixing of the real part and of the imaginary part of each of the complex fields .",
    "these new features do not appear to present any new numerical difficulty , and in fact no difficulty was found .",
    "furthermore , a trial with a toy nonlinearity suggests that there are also no new problems in dealing with nonlinear terms , except those of complexity .    although the present paper deals almost exclusively with linearized gravity , the infrastructure developed here is more widely applicable .",
    "our next step in the psw program is to solve the post - minkowskian problem for the orbiting point masses .",
    "the equations to be solved in this method have the same operator @xmath313 on the left hand side , but have `` sources '' quadratic in @xmath314 on the right .",
    "( there is also a second derivative on the right multiplied by an undifferentiated @xmath79 ; this term can be treated , like the others , as a perturbation , or it can be moved to the left to modify the principal part . ) in the usual spirit of a post - minkowski approximation , we could solve first for the first - order fields and treat them as known sources .",
    "alternatively , in a numerical approach , we could treat the equations as a given nonlinear problem .",
    "either way , the formalism developed in the present paper goes over directly to the post - minkowskian problem .",
    "again , the fields can be described with four real and three complex helical scalars , and the equations and boundary conditions follow from the simple relations between the helical scalars and their inertial equivalents , i.e. , relations like those in eqs .",
    "( [ tildepsifirst ] )  ( [ tildepsilast ] ) .",
    "the full einstein equations can also be viewed as a higher order extension of the post - minkowski equations . in principle , the only change from the post - minkowski problem is the inclusion of terms of all orders on the nonlinear right - hand side of the field equations . again",
    "the formalism developed in the present paper should suffice for the description of the problem , and should be convenient .",
    "in particular , helical scalars of the background minkowski space will be helical scalars of the full metric . in practice",
    ", new problems will arise .",
    "one is the question of the relativistic kepler s law : what is the appropriate relationship relating the source strength ( encoded in inner boundary conditions ) , the coordinate separation of the sources , and the parameter @xmath315 ?",
    "the post - minkowskian approximation , for which the answer is known , will help clarify how this is to be handled in full general relativity .",
    "a more subtle question is whether it is justified to use a formalism based on weak - field structures to describe strong gravitational fields .",
    "for highly curved spacetimes do minkowksi - like coordinates exist with which we can use the formalism of the present paper ? possibly relevant to this is the fact that in our computations we can impose inner boundary condistions at some distance from the sources , so that the effects of strong fields can be somewhat controlled .    in any case",
    ", the relative simplicity of the description presented here , along with the absence of any new computational difficulties ( that is , difficulties not present in the scalar problem ) is a reason for optimism that the next steps can be taken reasonably quickly .",
