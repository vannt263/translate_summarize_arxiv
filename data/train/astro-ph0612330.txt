    "one of the fundamental questions of solar system formation is the origin of planetary spins .",
    "the spin axes of three of the four giant planets in our solar system are tilted significantly , with the present values of the obliquities ( the angle between the spin axis and the orbit normal ) of jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune equal to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "@xcite has recently proposed a unified mechanism for the origin of the obliquities of the giant planets .",
    "the starting point of brunini s model is the so - called nice model @xcite for the establishment of the orbital architecture of the giant planets . in the nice model ,",
    "the outer solar system was initially compact , with jupiter and saturn closer than their mutual 2:1 mean - motion resonance and all of the giant planets within @xmath4 of the sun .",
    "the scattering of planetesimals initially in a disk starting just beyond the orbits of the planets caused jupiter to migrate inward and saturn , uranus , and neptune outward .",
    "when jupiter and saturn crossed the 2:1 mean - motion resonance , their orbital eccentricities were excited and the orbits of uranus and neptune were destabilized .",
    "a phase of close encounters among the giant planets followed , and uranus and neptune were scattered outward .",
    "the orbital eccentricities and inclinations of the giant planets were eventually damped to their present values by the interactions with planetesimals .",
    "@xcite has performed numerical simulations of the nice model that follow the evolution of the planetary spin axes .",
    "he found that large obliquities are generated during the encounter phase and that the final obliquities are similar to the present values , including the @xmath2 obliquity of uranus .",
    "@xcite has subsequently retracted his paper on the basis that simulations performed with another numerical code do not reproduce the previous results and show changes in the obliquities of only a few degrees in most runs .",
    "however , he did not provide any physical explanation as to why the later numerical results are more likely to be correct .",
    "given the wide publicity of the first results , we thought it important to show in this paper a simple analytic argument ( section 2 ) that explains why significant obliquities of the outer planets can not result from close encounters between these planets in the nice model .",
    "the analytic argument is verified by numerical simulations ( section 3 ) .",
    "we note that a summary of our results was presented by @xcite prior to the retraction by @xcite .",
    "while our focus is on the nice model , our analysis of the obliquity changes in encounters can also be adapted to any scenario involving close encounters among the planets , such as the scenario proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , in which several ice giants were formed in the outer solar system and all but two were ejected by encounters .",
    "let us consider the change in the spin direction of a planet of mass @xmath5 , radius @xmath6 , and spin frequency @xmath7 , due to an encounter with a perturbing planet of mass @xmath8 .",
    "if we assume principle axis rotation , the spin angular momentum of the planet is @xmath9 and the torque from the perturber at a distance @xmath10 in the direction @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unit vector of the spin direction , @xmath14 is the moment of inertia of the planet normalized to @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the quadrupole coefficient of the planet .",
    "the torque from the planet s oblate figure on a satellite locks the satellite to the planet s equator plane if the nodal precession period of the satellite is short compared to the timescale on which the spin direction of the planet is changed @xcite . in the above equations , @xmath17 is the orbital angular momentum ( normalized to @xmath18 ) of the satellites whose orbits are coupled to the planet s equator , and @xmath19 is the ratio of the torque from the perturber on the satellites to that directly exerted on the planet ( see @xcite for explicit definitions of @xmath17 and @xmath20 ) . from @xmath21 , the rate of change of the spin direction is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the sun and @xmath24 is the precession constant of the planet ( plus its satellites ) at the _ current _ orbital semimajor axis , @xmath25 , of the planet .",
    "because the torque decreases rapidly with the distance @xmath10 , we expect the total change in the spin direction in an encounter , @xmath26 , to be roughly equal to the rate of change at closest approach , @xmath27 , times the duration of closest approach , @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the relative separation and speed at closest approach and the proportionality constant is a function of the encounter geometry .",
    "a more accurate expression for @xmath32 can be obtained by neglecting solar gravity and using the two - body approximation during the encounter .",
    "then @xmath33 where @xmath34(@xmath35 ) and @xmath36 are , respectively , the eccentricity and true anomaly of the relative orbit . in the coordinate system where the relative orbit is in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane and",

    "@xmath50 , which is independent of @xmath41 and maximum at @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "the plot of the maximum @xmath26 for a given @xmath34 as a function of @xmath34 shows that it decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "thus @xmath26 , as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , is maximum for @xmath49 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 : @xmath51    since uranus has the largest current obliquity and the largest changes in its spin direction come from encounters with saturn , we consider first the change in the spin direction of uranus due to an encounter with saturn . as we shall see in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , saturn s orbit ( of semimajor axis @xmath52 ) remains nearly circular , and an encounter between saturn and uranus must have uranus on an eccentric orbit ( of eccentricity @xmath53 ) , with uranus usually near its perihelion .",
    "thus the relative encounter speed at large separation is @xmath54 \\la 0.22 ( g m_0/a_{\\rm s})^{1/2}$ ] if @xmath55 .",
    "since the encounter phase occurs long after the formation of the regular satellites in the nice model , the regular satellite systems must survive the encounter , and a reasonable lower limit to the separation @xmath30 at closest approach is the semimajor axis @xmath56 of the orbit of titan around saturn . for @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the masses of saturn and uranus , respectively ) , and @xmath61^{1/2 } \\approx [ 2 g ( m_{\\rm s } + m_{\\rm u})/r_p]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "so the maximum change in the spin direction of uranus from an encounter with saturn is @xmath62 if we adopt @xmath63 from @xcite .    for the same encounter between uranus and saturn , the maximum change in the spin direction of saturn",
    "is @xmath64 if @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "if we also adopt @xmath66 from @xcite , the changes from an encounter between neptune and saturn are nearly identical to those from an encounter between uranus and saturn , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , because uranus and neptune have similar masses and @xmath69 ( see eq .",
    "( [ deltasmax ] ) ) . for an encounter between uranus and neptune , @xmath70 .",
    "we do not consider encounters with jupiter , since such encounters usually result in systems that do not resemble the solar system by , e.g. , ejecting the planet encountering jupiter @xcite .",
    "the precession constants adopted above include the contributions from the satellites of the planets . in the case of uranus ,",
    "the contributions are mainly from titania and oberon",
    ". however , the nodal precession periods of titania and oberon ( @xmath71 due to the oblateness of uranus alone and @xmath72 with the inclusion of the secular interactions among the satellites ; @xcite ) are much longer than the encounter timescale with either saturn ( @xmath73days for @xmath74 ) or neptune ( @xmath75day for @xmath76 ) , and their orbits would not be able to follow the equator of uranus during the encounter @xcite .",
    "this would reduce @xmath77 and hence the already small maximum change in the spin direction of uranus by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , without the contributions from the satellites to the precession constants , the maximum changes in the spin directions of neptune and saturn are reduced by a factor of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "then the maximum change in the spin direction is @xmath81 for any pair - wise encounter among saturn , uranus , and neptune , even if we consider an extremely close encounter with @xmath30 equal to twice the sum of the planetary radii , which the regular satellite systems are unlikely to survive .",
    "we have just shown that the change in the spin direction in _ inertial space _ during an encounter between the planets is very small .",
    "thus any change in the obliquity ( which is defined as the angle between the spin axis and the orbit normal ) must be due to a change in the orbital inclination . as we shall see in , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the orbital inclinations of the ice giants can reach maximum values of @xmath82@xmath83 during the encounter phase .",
    "however , because the timescale on which the inclination is changed by encounters and damped by planetesimals ( @xmath84 ) is much less than the precession period of the spin axis about the orbit normal due to solar torque ( @xmath85 for uranus ) , there is not enough time for the spin axis to precess much due to solar torque , and the spin axis does not stray far from its initial position nearly perpendicular to the initial orbital planes of the planets .",
    "therefore , we expect the obliquities to return to small values as the inclinations are damped to their present values .",
    "to verify the analytic argument in section 2 and to eliminate the possibility of unexpected secular spin - orbit effects , we have performed numerical simulations of the sun and the four giant planets using the symplectic @xmath86-body code symba @xcite , which we have modified to include spin evolution . for the orbital evolution ,",
    "we ignore the negligible effects of the oblateness of the planets , and we use imposed migration and damping of eccentricity and inclination to model the effects of the planetesimals . @xcite",
    "have described how symba can be modified to include forced migration and damping of eccentricity and inclination .",
    "the unit vector @xmath87 of the spin direction of planet @xmath88 is evolved according to @xmath89 where the symbols are as in eq .",
    "( [ dsdt ] ) , but with the subscript 0 for the sun and @xmath90 for the planets . in eq .",
    "( [ dskdt ] ) , the first term is due to the torque from the sun and the second term is due to the torques from the other planets . the recursively subdivided time step used by symba to handle close encounters between the planets is also implemented for the spin evolution due to the planetary torques . in the appendix",
    ", we describe in more details how symba is modified to include spin evolution and the tests that were performed .",
    "we present the results from 4 series of runs , each with 30 simulations .",
    "the simulations were performed with a time step of @xmath91 . for the precession constants at the current orbital semimajor axes , we adopt @xmath92 for jupiter , @xmath93 for saturn , @xmath94 for the initially inner ice giant , and @xmath95 for the initially outer ice giant .",
    "these values include the contributions from the satellites @xcite .",
    "although the inner and outer ice giants can switch positions ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the fact that we adopt the parameters of uranus ( neptune ) for the initially inner ( outer ) ice giant is not important , because uranus and neptune have similar masses and @xmath69 .",
    "the four series of runs have the following initial conditions in common : the orbital eccentricities are @xmath96 ; both the orbit normals and the spin axes are tilted by @xmath96 radians ( or @xmath97 ) from the @xmath98-axis of the inertial frame ; the mean anomalies , the arguments of perihelion , and the longitudes of the ascending nodes on the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane of both the orbits and the equators are random variables .    in series i ,",

    "series ii is similar to series i , but with @xmath117 .",
    "series iii and iv have initial orbital semimajor axes closer to those adopted by @xcite and use a different prescription for migration and damping .",

    "this form of damping has been used to model planet - disk interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it has the reasonable property of tying the damping rates to the migration rate ( i.e. , less damping when the migration slows down ) .",

    "the changes in the directions of the spin axes relative to inertial space during the encounters are minuscule ( panel c ) . as the inclinations",
    "are damped to small values , the spin axes keep their orientations in inertial space , and the obliquities are similarly decreased .",
    "these behaviors are exactly what we expect from the analytic argument in section 2 .    for jupiter",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "this could be due to secular spin - orbit coupling , because the spin precession due to solar torque is quite fast for jupiter ( @xmath92 ) , but a detailed examination of this process is beyond the scope of the present paper .    among the cases with all four giant planets surviving on reasonable orbits ( @xmath142 out of @xmath143 simulations in all four series )",
    ", there are only four cases where one or both of the ice giants have final obliquities greater than @xmath144 , including one case where one of the ice giants ( neptune ) has a final obliquity greater than @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "however , these cases involve one or two extremely close encounters between the planets ( usually between saturn and the initially inner ice giant ) , for which the regular satellite systems are unlikely to survive .",
    "even if the regular satellites could survive these encounters , their orbits would not be able to follow the equators of the planets during the encounters , and the final obliquities obtained in our simulations ( which include the contributions from the satellites ) should be reduced by a factor of @xmath147@xmath148 ( see section 2 ) and @xmath149 even in the most extreme case .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution of the obliquities of the giant planets in the nice model @xcite , where the jupiter - saturn 2:1 resonance crossing led to close encounters among the giant planets and the orbital eccentricities and inclinations were eventually damped to their present values by the interactions with planetesimals .",
    "we presented a simple analytic argument which shows that the change in the spin direction of a planet in inertial space during an encounter between the planets is very small and that the change in the obliquity ( which is measured from the orbit normal ) is due to the change in the orbital inclination .",
    "since the inclinations are changed by encounters and damped by planetesimal interactions on timescales much shorter than the timescales on which the spins precess due to solar torques , especially for uranus and neptune , the obliquities return to small values if they are small before the encounters .",
    "we have performed simulations using the symplectic integrator symba modified to include spin evolution .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with the analytic argument leading to no significant remnant obliquities .",
    "the analytic argument provides a physical explanation as to why the numerical results reported by @xcite , which are not confirmed by later simulations by him using another numerical code @xcite or the simulations in this paper , are indeed incorrect .",
    "giant impacts in the late stages of the formation of uranus and neptune remain a plausible explanation for the obliquities of the ice giants , but a giant impact origin for saturn s obliquity is problematic because of its large mass and spin angular momentum @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the obliquities of the giant planets could be generated by any process that twists the total angular momentum vector of the solar system on a timescale of @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "however , the similarity between saturn s spin - axis precession rate and the nodal regression rate of neptune s orbit , and the near match of saturn s @xmath1 obliquity to that of the cassini state 2 of the secular spin - orbit resonance , strongly argue for the capture of saturn into the cassini state whose obliquity increases during the dispersal of the planetesimal disk @xcite .",

    "a single step of overall time step @xmath171 of the symba algorithm can be represented by the following sequence of substeps : @xmath172 in the substep @xmath173 , each planet takes a linear drift in its heliocentric position ( corresponding to a linear drift in the position of the sun from the barycenter ) for time @xmath174 . in the substep @xmath175 , each planet receives a kick to its linear momentum due to the @xmath176 level forces from the other planets for time @xmath174 . in the recursive substep @xmath177 , a planet that is not having close encounters ( i.e. , a planet whose separation from any other planet is greater than @xmath155 ) evolves along a kepler orbit for time @xmath171 , while a pair of planets having an encounter have their time steps recursively subdivided to a maximum level of @xmath178  with the force at level @xmath17 , @xmath167 , applied with a time step @xmath168  if their separation @xmath179 during the overall step ( see @xcite for details ) .    in eq .",

    "we found that the numerical precession rates agreed with the analytic results to within 0.0008 and 0.0022 fractionally for planets 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the small discrepancies were not sensitive to the time step ( we used @xmath195 and smaller ) , and they are likely real and due to solar perturbations .",
    "solar perturbations also caused the eccentricity of the relative orbit to vary between @xmath211 and @xmath217 and the obliquities to show small variations on the same timescale .",

    "<S> we present a simple analytic argument which shows that the change in the spin direction of a planet relative to an inertial frame during an encounter between the planets is very small and that the change in the obliquity ( which is measured from the orbit normal ) is due to the change in the orbital inclination . </S>",
    "<S> since the inclinations are damped by planetesimal interactions on timescales much shorter than the timescales on which the spins precess due to the torques from the sun , especially for uranus and neptune , the obliquities should return to small values if they are small before the encounters . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations using the symplectic integrator symba , modified to include spin evolution due to the torques from the sun and mutual planetary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results are consistent with the analytic argument for no significant remnant obliquities . </S>"
