    "considerable attention has recently been devoted to the study of genuinely  quantum \" correlations or entanglement in the ground states of many - body systems among theorists @xcite and experimentalists @xcite , an exciting field that profits from the interplay of quantum information and condensed matter .",
    "the measure of entanglement most extensively studied so far is the von neumann entropy @xmath0 , which quantifies the entanglement between two complementary parts of a system , the common state of which is pure .",
    "this measure is known to display a universal divergence at criticality @xcite . however , the scenario of  complementary parts \" is rather restrictive by demanding that the two parts span the whole of a many - body system .",
    "much more natural is the case where a portion of the system does not belong to either of the parts under consideration ; that is , it forms an environment .",
    "moreover , such a general setting is of relevance for a situation where two parties have access to limited groups of constituents and attempt to exploit the entanglement between these groups for quantum information tasks .    in general",
    ", the state of two noncomplementary parts @xmath1 is a statistical mixture and @xmath0 is no longer suitable to quantify their entanglement . to this end",
    ", one must invoke the logarithmic negativity @xmath2 @xcite , which is the only adequate measure for this task which is , at the same time , straightforwardly computable .",
    "in addition , it has operational meaning ( in terms of bounds ) in teleportation and distillation .",
    "it is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the partial transposition that amounts to @xmath5 with respect to a complete set of basis states @xmath6 on the bipartite system .",
    "though , for the special case of pure states @xmath2 and @xmath0 can both be computed from the so - called schmidt coefficients @xcite , whether the former is universal and whether its behavior can be related to scaling exponents are open questions .",
    "indeed @xmath2 is defined purely from quantum information considerations , and its manifestation of the elegant scaling features from many - body physics will be a true surprise .",
    "unfortunately , it is notoriously difficult to compute @xmath2 even for the simplest of one - dimensional ( 1d ) models for which some numerical results have been obtained @xcite . in this article",
    ", we present an analytic study of entanglement , as measured by @xmath2 , between two macroscopic groups of spins , in a tripartite splitting of a many - body system displaying a quantum phase transition .",
    "we mainly focus on the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model for which we find that @xmath2 is always finite in stark contrast with other macroscopic correlation measures such as mutual information @xmath7 which diverges .",
    "remarkably , @xmath2 does not depend on the anisotropy parameter at the transition point and may , in this sense , be considered as universal .",
    "however , we also found that this is not a generic feature since the same analysis in the dicke model @xcite shows a different behavior .",
    "most importantly , we show that _ in the limiting case of a bipartition , @xmath2 diverges at the critical point as @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the system size ) , exactly as the entanglement entropy_. this property which is also found in other models leads us to conjecture that it should be valid for all systems .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath9 spins @xmath10 which are mutually coupled through an anisotropic @xmath11-type interaction and subjected to a magnetic field of strength @xmath12 pointing in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the ground - state entanglement of this model introduced by lipkin , meshkov , and glick ( lmg ) in 1965 @xcite to describe nuclei , has been the subject of many recent studies @xcite .",
    "the lmg hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the pauli operators acting on the state space of the @xmath17th spin .",
    "here , we only consider the case of ferromagnetic interactions and , without loss of generality , we restrict , in a first step , the anisotropy parameter to @xmath18 and the field to @xmath19 .",
    "this system undergoes a second - order quantum phase transition at @xmath20 , between a symmetric ( @xmath21 ) and a broken ( @xmath22 ) phase , which is well described by a mean - field approach .",
    "the corresponding classical ground state is fully polarized in the field direction ( @xmath23 ) for @xmath21 , and twofold degenerate with @xmath24 for @xmath22 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "in order to compute entanglement of the ground state in a tripartite setting , we divide the @xmath9 spins into three groups 1 , 2 , and 3 with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 spins , respectively , satisfying @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , we partition the spin operators into @xmath29 . to diagonalize the hamiltonian and",
    "hence obtain the ground state in the thermodynamical limit , it is convenient to express the @xmath30 s in terms of bosonic operators using the so - called holstein - primakoff representation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "note that we focus here on maximum spin sectors to which the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ eq : spinham ] ) is known to belong .",
    "in addition , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the single - mode case , substituting the expressions ( [ eq : hp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hp2 ] ) in ( [ eq : spinham ] ) requires a prior rotation of spin operators to bring the @xmath13 axis along the classical magnetization of the ground state .",
    "using this bosonic representation and expanding @xmath33 at order @xmath34 , one obtains @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes constant terms which will be irrelevant in the following and where we introduced the @xmath37 real symmetric matrices @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes the identity matrix . in the symmetric ( @xmath41 ) and broken ( @xmath42 ) phases the prefactors read @xmath43 and we further note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 . since the hamiltonian ( [ bosonham ] ) is quadratic , it is straightforwardly diagonalized via a bogoliubov transform .",
    "as discussed in @xcite within a single - mode description , the gap for @xmath41 is given by @xmath46 , whereas it vanishes as @xmath47 in the broken phase @xcite .",
    "without loss of generality , we compute the entanglement of the ground state @xmath48 between group 1 and group 3 by computing the logarithmic negativity @xmath2 between the corresponding bosonic modes . to capture the entanglement properties of the arising mixed state",
    "the only available measure is @xmath2 except for the limit of two spins for which concurrence can also be used @xcite . in the present context a convenient definition for @xmath49 may be invoked .",
    "indeed , the ground state is a gaussian state for which an elegant framework is available that has allowed for a multitude of significant analytical results in the past ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "entanglement between any two of the groups may be inferred from the covariance matrix @xmath50 which collects the second moments @xmath51 of canonical coordinates @xmath52 and momenta @xmath53 , which we group together in the vector @xmath54 . in this representation",
    "@xmath50 adopts an explicit expression in terms of matrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite which , by virtue of @xmath57=0 $ ] , reads @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , the reduced density operator @xmath60 ( @xmath61 denotes the partial trace over group @xmath62 ) has a representation in terms of a gaussian state with covariance matrix @xmath63 obtained from @xmath50 upon canceling rows and columns that correspond to mode @xmath62 , namely , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "then , upon partial transposition @xmath4 , the covariance matrix is subjected to partial time reversal @xmath67 @xcite and is transformed into @xmath68 obtained from @xmath69 by changing the sign in the off - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ covp ] ) . the logarithmic negativity can then be computed in terms of the symplectic ( degenerate ) eigenvalues of @xmath68 , @xmath70 where @xmath71\\,\\big(\\alpha+\\alpha^{-1}-2\\big)/2\\geq 0 $ ] and where the @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) sign corresponds to @xmath74 @xmath75 . indeed , noting that @xmath76 , the logarithmic negativity reads as @xcite @xmath77 equation ( [ logneg ] ) is the central result of this article and we now discuss it in detail .",
    "first , let us note that for an arbitrary tripartition of the system ( @xmath78 , for @xmath79 ) @xmath2 is _ finite _ across the whole phase diagram @xmath80 including the transition point @xmath20 , where one has @xmath81 remarkably , this expression does not depend on the anisotropy parameter @xmath82 revealing the _ universal character _ of the logarithmic negativity at the critical point of the lmg model . the fact that a measure of quantum correlations between macroscopic groups of particles is finite at a quantum critical point is also entirely nontrivial . for example",
    ", the mutual information @xmath83 diverges as , indeed , for the simple case of an equal tripartition , one has @xmath84 .",
    "thus mutual information diverges as the entropy , that is , as @xmath85 @xcite , while it was found to be finite in 1d and for short - ranged interactions @xcite .",
    "as @xmath86 measures all correlations , one may conclude that it is the classical part of correlations that is responsible for the divergence , whereas the quantum part ( as measured by @xmath2 ) remains finite .",
    "we depict the behavior of @xmath2 for such a tripartition and compare it with data from exact diagonalization in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .     as a function of magnetic field @xmath12 for an equal tripartition @xmath87 and for two different values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath82 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "corresponding to the red ( gray ) lines , at the critical point , @xmath2 is universal ( independent of @xmath82 ) .",
    "black lines correspond to numerical data for @xmath88 which match the analytical prediction @xmath89 increasingly well .",
    "note also that @xmath2 vanishes for @xmath90 where the ground state is separable @xcite .",
    "[ fig.1],scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "most importantly , when @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which corresponds to the limiting bipartite case @xmath93 , @xmath2 diverges at the critical point .",
    "such a behavior is in agreement with the fact that , for a bipartite pure state , @xmath2 is lower bounded by @xmath0 @xcite which is divergent at @xmath20 . to analyze this divergence ,",
    "one expands @xmath2 in the vicinity of the critical point by imposing this bipartition condition from the beginning and one obtains  : @xmath94 it is interesting to note that this singular behavior is exactly the same ( up to constant terms ) as the one obtained for other entanglement measures computed in this model @xcite .",
    "this correspondence allows us to straightforwardly extract the finite - size behavior at the critical point by using the same line of reasoning .",
    "indeed , the scaling argument introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath95 in order to check this behavior , we perform exact diagonalization for increasing system sizes at @xmath20 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , numerical data perfectly match the analytical predictions of the thermodynamical limit .",
    "note that , in the broken phase , there is an offset of @xmath96 which is due to the fact that the ground state is twofold degenerate . as can be easily understood in the limit @xmath97 for which the finite - size numerical ground state is given by a cat - state",
    ", this offset is only present for a bipartition but does not occur for a tripartition , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] . the expression ( [ eq : divergence ] )",
    "allows us to add one more equivalence of critical scaling laws in the lmg model since , at the critical point , we have now @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the geometric entanglement , @xmath100 the single - copy entanglement , @xmath0 the entanglement entropy , and @xmath2 the logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "of course , it would be very valuable to establish the same kind of equivalence in 1d spin systems for which one already knows that @xcite @xmath101     as a function of the magnetic field @xmath12 for a bipartition @xmath102 , and @xmath103 shown as red ( gray ) line . in the broken phase @xmath22 we plot @xmath104 for a reason detailed in the text .",
    "black lines corresponds to exact diagonalization data for @xmath105 .",
    "inset : scaling of @xmath2 with system size @xmath106 from exact diagonalization ( black circles ) approaching a linear dependence on @xmath107 with slope @xmath108 ( dashed line ) for large @xmath9.[fig.2],scaledwidth=38.0% ]    although a rigorous proof is still missing , our result together with recent numerical studies@xcite leads us to conjecture that in 1d critical systems and for a bipartition , one has @xmath109 .",
    "if confirmed , this result may even be valid in any dimensions .",
    "finally , let us discuss the case @xmath110 which is trivially solved since commutes with @xmath111 and @xmath112 so that the eigenstates are the ( permutation - symmetric ) dicke states @xmath113 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the ground state is fully polarized in the @xmath13 direction ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) and , consequently , @xmath116 for any tripartition . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the nondegenerate ground state is still in the maximum spin sector @xmath114 but @xmath117 decreases with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the isotropic case is thus in a different universality class as compared to @xmath118 and it is interesting to compute @xmath2 in the limit @xmath119 . there",
    ", the ground state is given by @xmath120 whose logarithmic negativity between groups @xmath121 and @xmath122 reads @xmath123 this expression strongly differs from eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_ani_crit ] ) ( different universality class ) while agreeing with the universal character of @xmath124 in the lmg model at criticality .",
    "the present study reveals two main properties of the logarithmic negativity at a critical point  : ( _ i _ ) for a tripartition @xmath125 is universal and finite  ; ( _ ii _ ) for a bipartition @xmath125 is universal and diverges as @xmath126 . to check the generality of these results",
    ", we computed @xmath125 in the dicke model @xcite for which the ground - state entropy has been already computed @xcite .",
    "this model describes a set of @xmath9 spins @xmath10 interacting with a single - mode bosonic field via the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , if one divides the spins in two parts , one can consider two different negativities ( spin - spin or field - spin ) .",
    "we computed both quantities and we found that , contrary to the lmg model , for a tripartition , @xmath125 is not universal ( but still finite ) at the critical point .",
    "however , in the bipartition limit , we found that @xmath125 behaves also as @xmath126 at the transition point .    these complementary studies of the dicke and lmg models",
    "together with 1d spin chain analysis @xcite lead us to conjecture that _ for a tripartition @xmath125 is finite but not universal _",
