    "at the beginning of the 90 s , a series of papers was started on the properties of the sculptor group galaxies ( puche & carignan 1988 ; carignan & puche 1990a , b ; puche , carignan & bosma 1990 ; puche & carignan 1991 ; puche , carignan & van gorkom 1991 ; puche , carignan & wainscoat 1991 ) . since the sculptor galaxies are all late - type spirals with very little or no bulge , they are ideal candidates for determining the basic dark halo parameters ( carignan & freeman 1985 ) .",
    "their simple disk + halo stucture makes it easier to identify the contribution of each component to the rotation curve . also , since the distribution of late - type spirals is usually extended ( huchtmeier , seiradakis & materne 1980 ) , it is possible to measure their rotation curve out to many disk scale lengths , an essential condition to tie down the halo parameters ( lake & feinswog 1989 ) .",
    "as described in puche & carignan ( 1988 ) , the sculptor group , the nearest group of galaxies from the local group , covers an area of @xmath2 on the sky . in this area , besides the five main members studied so far ( ngc 55 , 247 , 253 , 300 and 7793 ) , two more galaxies , ngc 24 and ngc 45 ( figure  [ dssimages ] ) , fall in the same region and have similar sizes and degree of resolution as well as @xmath3 20 known dwarf galaxies ( ct , freeman & carignan 1997 ; ct , carignan & freeman 2000 ) .",
    "however , when looking at the estimated distances , a mean distance of @xmath4 mpc is found for the main members ( de vaucouleurs 1978 ) but 6.8 mpc ( 7@xmath5 ) and 5.9 mpc ( 6@xmath5 ) for ngc 24 and ngc 45 , respectively ( based on a hubble constant of 75 kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , tully 1988 ) .",
    "moreover , when doing dynamical mass estimates of the group , any combination of the main members gives consistently @xmath7 m@xmath8 for the group , while including ngc 24 and ngc 45 makes the estimate jump to @xmath9 m@xmath8 , clearly too large for a loose group like sculptor .",
    "all this suggests strongly that ngc 24 and ngc 45 are not members of the group but background objects .",
    "even if they were not members of the sculptor group , it was decided to study them because they belong to a very interesting subgroup of galaxies called the low surface brightness ( lsb ) spiral galaxies , especially ngc 45 .",
    "the kinematical study of lsb galaxies currently feeds the `` cusp - core controversy '' , ( e.g. swaters et al .",
    "2003 ; hayashi et al . 2004 ; de blok 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "one of the many important questions which is brought to the forefront from the numerous studies of this type of object and which motivates part of the present work , is whether or not lsbs ( and more generally low mass late - type spirals ) can possibly form a distinct class in the hubble sequence .",
    "the hypothesis emanating from studies on lsbs is : morphologically they belong to the spiral class , but dynamically they look more like the dwarf irregular class since they are dominated at all radii by their dark halo ( jobin & carignan 1990 ; ct , carignan & sancisi 1991 ; martimbeau , carignan & roy 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , a study of optical rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( buchhorn 1992 ) showed convincingly that the optical rotation curves in the inner parts of these galaxies give @xmath10 ratios which are very high .",
    "the most likely explanation for this effect is that the dark matter component contributes a large fraction of the gravitational field even in the inner regions of lsbs galaxies ( de blok & bosma 2002 ) .",
    "verheijen ( 1999 ) and verheijen & tully ( 1999 ) have shown convincingly the clear dichotomy between the rotation curves of hsb ( high surface brightness ) galaxies , which are most of the time close to the maximum disk situation , and those of lsb galaxies which are dominated at all radii by the dark matter component .",
    "thus , in terms of their mass distribution , lsbs appear to be more closely related to dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. ddo 154 : carignan & freeman 1988 ; carignan & beaulieu 1989 ) where the luminous component is known to make a negligible contribution to the gravitational field everywhere in the disk , than to massive spirals ( e.g. ngc 6946 : carignan et al 1990 ) where the luminous disk is the main contributor in the inner regions and the dark component only contributes significantly in the outer parts .        in order to get a better understanding of the mass distribution in ngc 24 and ngc 45 ,",
    "both optical and 21  cm radio observations were obtained and are presented in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section",
    "[ sec : photometry ] , the luminosity profiles and the optical properties are discussed . after studying the content and its distribution in section  [ sec : neutrgas ] , section  [ sec : kinematics ]",
    "concentrates on the velocity field of these systems and presents their rotation curves . in section  [ sec : mass ]",
    "the data are analyzed in terms of a two component model : a luminous ( stellar@xmath11gaseous ) disk and a dark halo represented by an isothermal sphere potential . finally , the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is followed by a summary of the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the surface photometry of ngc 24 was obtained from a set of observations in the @xmath12band using a 1024@xmath131024 thompson ccd , with the f/1 focal reducer at the prime focus of the aat 3.9 m. the 19@xmath14 m pixels resulted in a resolution of 0.98@xmath15/pixel for a total field of 16.7@xmath16 .",
    "the adopted mean extinction was 0.085 per airmass in the @xmath17-band .",
    "the data were obtained in 1990 september , with integration times of 20s and 5s .",
    "after the images were bias subtracted and flat - fielded using dark sky flats , the foreground overexposed stars were removed .",
    "pixels within a circular region were deleted and replaced by a two dimensional surface function evaluated from the pixels lying in a surrounding background annulus .",
    "afterwards , the sky previously evaluated by averaging the signal of many regions depleted of stars was subtracted from the galaxy image .          in order to get the kinematical information needed ,",
    "high sensitivity low resolution line observations were obtained with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "they consist of 6h observations for each galaxy ( 5h on source , 1h on calibrators ) , made in 1992 june . in order to get a",
    "better _ uv _ plane coverage , the hybrid dnc configuration , with larger antenna spacings in the north arm was selected , since ngc 24 ( @xmath18 ) and ngc 45 ( @xmath19 ) are at low declinations .",
    "the candidates have been observed with a total bandwidth of 1.56  mhz divided in 128 channels and using on - line hanning smoothing .",
    "this gives a channel separation of 12.2  khz , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters of the synthesis observations can be found in tables  [ vla - n24 ] and  [ vla - n45 ] .",
    "no attempt to correct for the beam - smearing effect is done in this article .",
    "first , the _ uv _ datasets were carefully examined to detect and reject bad points due to interference or crosstalk between antennae .",
    "antennae which were shadowed by another antenna during the observations were flagged bad for the shadowing period .",
    "the data were then calibrated using the standard vla calibration procedure .",
    "the flux scale was obtained using the continuum source 0134 + 329 .",
    "a bandpass calibration was also applied .",
    "the reduction was done using the nrao software package aips at the vla and at the universit de montral .",
    "first , by creating and inspecting a preliminary series of channel maps , the channels containing only continuum radiation were identified .",
    "next , those channels , free of emission line , were averaged in the _ uv _ plane , to represent the continuum radiation , and subtracted from all the channels . finally , the channel maps were produced and cleaned simultaneously via a fourier transform with natural weighting and no taper .",
    "the pixel size was 10@xmath15 for both systems and the original beam were convolved by circular beams of 40@xmath21 for ngc 24 and 42@xmath22 for ngc 45 .",
    "this was done to make sure that all the structures that are observed are not due to the original slightly elongated beam shape .",
    "the resulting maps had a rms noise of 2.4  mjy / beam and 1.6  mjy / beam for ngc 24 and ngc 45 respectively .",
    "a study of the @xmath12band isophotes shows that the intrinsic axis ratio varies from 0.5 near the center to 0.26 at the last measured isophote .",
    "the mean photometric parameters computed within the radius range @xmath23 are @xmath24 ( b / a = 0.26 ) and @xmath25 .",
    "the elliptically averaged luminosity profile in the @xmath12band , illustrated in figure  [ lp ] and listed in table  [ iprof - n24 ] , was obtained using the _ ellipse _ task in iraf . in the very inner parts ( @xmath26 ) the profile shows a decrease , probably due to internal absorption , while in the outer parts , it reveals a typical exponential decline .",
    "an exponential fit to the @xmath12luminosity profile ( 80@xmath27 ) yields an extrapolated central surface brightness of 19.12  magarcsec@xmath28 which , when corrected for @xmath12galactic extinction and inclination , gives @xmath29 mag arcsec@xmath28 .",
    "a galactic extinction @xmath30 ( draine 1989 ) was used , where @xmath31 according to de vaucouleurs et al ( 1991 ) ( hereafter referred to as rc3 ) .",
    "the derived exponential scale length is @xmath32 43 , which corresponds to @xmath3 1.42 kpc at 6.8 mpc .    when transformed to the @xmath33band ( @xmath34 for the sc morphological type , from carignan 1983 filter responses ( bessell 1979 ) . ] ) , this finally gives @xmath35 , which is faint relative to the freeman canonical value of @xmath36 for normal spiral galaxies ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "the central surface brightness of ngc 24 lies in the range of 22.07 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath37 23.70 mag , as defined by romanishin , strom & strom ( 1983 ) for their lsb sample , but is at the limit ( within the errors ) between low surface brightness objects and normal galaxies .",
    "one notices here that contrary to ngc 45 , which is a genuine lsb ( romanishin et al .",
    "1983 , see  [ photn45 ] ) with anemic spiral",
    "arms and no evident bulge ( fig .",
    "[ dssimages ] ) , the morphological properties of ngc 24 ( presence of distinct spiral arms and a small bulge ) are comparable with those of high surface brightness late - type spirals .    integrating the @xmath33luminosity profile",
    "gives a total apparent magnitude @xmath39 = 12.13 , which is in good agreement with the value of 12.10 given by sandage & tammann ( 1987 ) and the value of 12.19 in rc3 .",
    "when corrected for internal absorption ( @xmath40 ( draine 1989 ) where @xmath41 from rc3 ) , it gives @xmath42 = 11.75 . at the distance of 6.8 mpc , the corrected absolute magnitude is @xmath43 = @xmath4417.41 .",
    "the corrected absolute magnitude corresponds to a total blue luminosity of @xmath45 .",
    "table  [ opar - n24 ] summarizes the optical parameters of ngc 24 .",
    "the photometric inclination is @xmath46 and the position angle of the major axis is @xmath47 ( puche & carignan 1988 ) .",
    "a @xmath33band surface brightness profile is used for ngc 45 , as derived in romanishin et al .",
    "we refer the reader to this article for the observational information on these data .",
    "the @xmath33band profile is shown in figure  [ lp ] and listed in table  [ bprof - n45 ] .",

    "this value translates into 2.20  kpc at our adopted distance of 5.9 mpc .",
    "integration of the @xmath49-band profile gives a total apparent magnitude of @xmath50 , which is comparable with the value of 11.10 given by sandage & tammann ( 1987 ) or the rc3 value of 11.32 .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute magnitude @xmath43 = @xmath4417.45 and a total blue luminosity of @xmath51 , at the distance of 5.9  mpc .",
    "the optical parameters are summarized in table  [ opar - n45 ] .",
    "once the correction for the primary beam attenuation had been applied , the flux in each individual channel was summed to give the global profile of figure  [ global ] ( left panel ) .",
    "an intensity - weighted systemic velocity of @xmath52 kms@xmath6and a midpoint heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath53 kms@xmath6were derived .",

    "it implies a total mass of @xmath60 @xmath61 , somewhat higher than the value of @xmath62 @xmath61given by huchtmeier & seiradakis ( 1985 ) for a distance of 6.8 mpc .",
    "it appears that no flux was missed by our synthesis observations .",

    "concentric elliptical averaging corrected by a factor @xmath65 gave the radial profile illustrated in figure  [ hiprof ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the surface density peaks at the center of the galaxy and then decreases as a function of radius . as compared with other morphological types of galaxies ( see fig .  10 in swaters et al .",
    "2002 ) , this profile is more typical of sd spirals ( in shape and amplitude ) than lsbs .",
    "both the morphological , optical and properties of ngc 24 point out that this spiral can be considered at the transition between normal and lsb galaxies . this distribution will be used in sec .",

    "the properties of ngc  45 were derived in a similar way as for ngc  24 .",

    "the total flux density of @xmath66 jy kms@xmath6 ( to be compared with @xmath67 jy kms@xmath6 in hipass ; koribalski et al .",
    "2004 ) corresponds to an mass of @xmath68 @xmath61 , which is to be compared with @xmath69 @xmath61 ( huchtmeier & seiradakis 1985 ) for a distance of 5.9 mpc .",
    "this seems to indicate that @xmath3 20% of the flux is missing , probably due to missing short spacings in the vla observations .",
    "also derived from the profile is the midpoint systemic velocity of @xmath70 kms@xmath6and the intensity - weighted systemic velocity of @xmath71 kms@xmath6 .",
    "the measured profile widths are @xmath72 kms@xmath6and @xmath73 kms@xmath6 .",

    "figures  [ contoptgreyhi_n45 ] ( right panel , in greyscale ) and  [ momn45 ] ( left panel , in contours superimposed on a dss photograph of the galaxy ) show the distribution of surface densities obtained by the moment analysis .",
    "the disk is regular and extends to @xmath3 20  in diameter @xmath76 at a level of @xmath64 .    the shape and amplitude of the radial distribution of the surface density ( fig .",
    "[ hiprof ] , right panel ) is typical of what is seen in low surface brightness spirals , showing a depression in the central regions with a low gas surface density level ( see fig .",
    "10 in swaters et al . 2002 for comparison ) .",
    "both morphological , photometric and gaseous properties of ngc 45 make this spiral a genuine low surface brightness galaxy .",
    "this profile will be used in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] to evaluate the dynamical importance of the ngc 45 component .",
    "figure  [ momn24 ] ( right panel ) shows the velocity field obtained by the moment analysis where the radial velocities were calculated by taking the intensity weighted mean of each line profile for pixels above the 1.8@xmath5 level , in the 40@xmath1340  resolution data cube .",
    "this velocity field is regular , with no sign of large - scale deviation from axial symmetry . from the shape of the isovelocity contours",
    ", one can already infer that this galaxy does not have a solid - body rotation curve ( the contours are not parallel ) but rather tends to be flat in the outer parts .        in order to extract the rotation curve ( rc ) , the _ rotcur _ task ( begeman 1989 ) of the gipsy program ( van der hulst et al .",
    "1992 ) was used .",
    "the task makes a least - square fitting of a tilted - ring model to the velocity field .",
    "a solution has to be found for the following five kinematical parameters : the coordinates of the rotation center , the systemic velocity ( @xmath77 ) , the inclination ( @xmath78 ) and the position angle ( @xmath79 ) of the major axis in order to obtain the circular velocity as a function of radius . to diminish the importance of deprojection errors at such an inclination , radial velocities in an opening angle of 80@xmath80 about the minor axis",
    "were rejected for the least - square fitting and a cosine weighting function giving more importance to points near the major axis was used .",
    "the fitting procedure is described in chemin et al .",
    "briefly , the rotation center and systemic velocity are first searched for , then the inclination and the position angle .",
    "the derived systemic velocity is @xmath81 kms@xmath6 , which is comparable to the value obtained with the global profile .",
    "the kinematical inclination is @xmath82 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the optical inclination of @xmath83 and the value found by an ellipse fitting to the isophotes ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the low spatial resolution of the data combined with the high inclination of the disk probably explains such a difference .",
    "the choice of either the photometric or the kinematical value does not influence the main result of this work ( see sections  [ sec : mass ] and  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "hence , the kinematical inclination is chosen for ngc 24 throughout the article and all derived quantities ( rotation curve , mass - to - light ratio , ... ) are given adopting this value , except where explicitely mentionned .",
    "the kinematical position angle is @xmath85 .",
    "this value remains comparable with the one derived from the photometry ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "a rotation curve is finally obtained ( figure  [ rc ] and table  [ rc - n24 ] ) by fixing all the other parameters at constant values because no warp is found in ngc 24 . at each radius",
    ", the quoted error - bar of the velocity point given in table  [ rc - n24 ] corresponds to the maximum value between the formal error calculated by _ rotcur _",
    "( @xmath87 dispersion of the fitted velocity parameter ) and the largest velocity difference between the solution for both sides and the separate solutions for the approaching and receding halves ( carignan & puche 1990a ) .",
    "the velocity field of ngc 45 , obtained from the analysis of the 42@xmath1342  resolution data cube by discarding pixels under a 1.6@xmath5 level , is shown in figure  [ momn45 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the same procedure as for ngc 24 is used to derive the rc of ngc 45 . to lessen the errors due to the deprojection",
    ", all points in a sector of 60@xmath80 around the minor axis were discarded from the fitting .",
    "a systemic velocity of 467@xmath882kms@xmath6is found , which agrees within the errors with the value obtained using the global profile and with the one given by adler & liszt ( 1989 ) .",
    "the inclination is found to be constant as a function of radius ( @xmath89 ) , and is in relative agreement with the photometric value within the error ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "a study of the isophotes shows that the outermost contour is slightly twisted with respect to the inner isophotes .",
    "the outer isovelocity contours are also twisted as a function of radius . a kinematical twist of the plane is indeed detected with the tilted - ring model ( figure  [ rc ] ) .",
    "the @xmath79 decreases by @xmath1 from the inner to the outer regions whereas @xmath78 remains constant . a kinematical warp or a simple twist of the kinematical major axis is very common in the sculptor group disks ( e.g. carignan & puche 1990a ) , and more generally in spiral galaxies ( garca - ruiz , sancisi & kuijken 2002 ) .",
    "the final rotation curve is thus derived by fixing the center coordinates , systemic velocity and inclination at constant values and by leaving the position angle free as a function of radius .",
    "the rc is given in table  [ rc - n45 ] and displayed in figure  [ rc ] . here",
    "again , no significant asymmetry is detected between the rcs of the approaching and receding sides of the disk .",
    "table  [ rc - n45 ] also gives the radial variation of the @xmath79 with its errors computed as the maximum value between the formal error calculated by _ rotcur _ ( @xmath87 dispersion of the fitted angle ) and the largest angle difference between the fitted value for both sides and the separate fitted values for the approaching and receding halves .",
    "a preliminary study of the mass distribution is presented here using the present low resolution data .",
    "this should give a first good estimate of the dark - to - luminous mass ratio in those two galaxies and allow us to get a good idea whether the dark matter component dominates at all radii , as seen in dwarf irregulars ( e.g. carignan & beaulieu 1989 ) , in some late - type spirals ( e.g. ct et al .",
    "1991 ) or in other lsb galaxies ( e.g. de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) . as for the other papers from this series ,",
    "only the best - fit mass models are presented for the two galaxies .",
    "these models are very close to the maximum disk case .",
    "notice that for ngc 45 another model that uses the mass - to - light ratio expected from stellar populations synthesis ( sps ) models is presented ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "one can refer to carignan ( 1985 ) , carignan & freeman ( 1985 ) and the other papers in this series for a detailed discussion of the two components ( dark and luminous ) model . because ngc 24 has a very small bulge and ngc 45 has no bulge , as seen in fig .",
    "[ dssimages ] , no attempt to include a bulge component in the models was made .",
    "for ngc 24 , the @xmath12profile derived in sec .",

    "the contribution of the gaseous component was derived assuming that all the gas is confined in an infinitely thin disk and using the radial surface densities ( fig .",
    "[ hiprof ] ) , which were multiplied by 4/3 to take into account primordial helium .",
    "the dark halo is modeled by an isothermal sphere which is described by two basic parameters : the core radius @xmath90 and the one - dimensionnal velocity dispersion @xmath5 . a third quantity , the central density of the halo , is related to the two others by @xmath91 . essentially , the mass model depends on three parameters : the amplitude scaling of the luminous disk @xmath10 ( the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk ) , the radial scaling @xmath90 and the velocity scaling @xmath5 of the halo . to determine the combination of the three parameters which best reproduces the observed rotation curve ,",
    "a best - fitting method was used , without any constraints on the parameter values . by exploring a grid of values in the three parameter space , a set [ @xmath10 , @xmath90 , @xmath5 ) ]",
    "is found leading to the smallest @xmath92 for the fit .",
    "once an approximate minimum has been identified , the solution is refined by improving the step resolution for the three parameters .",
    "this routine is reiterated until a final set of parameters is obtained",
    ". the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk is supposed to be constant as a function of radius and the errors on the derived model parameters are established from the 90% confidence level for both galaxies .",
    "notice that no attempt to explore different functional forms for the halo was made with these data . a comparison between a cuspy halo , like e.g. the nfw one ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) , and a core - dominated halo , like the one presented here , indeed requires high spatial resolution data for accurately mapping the inner rising part of a rotation curve ( swaters , madore & trewhella 2000 ) .",
    "such mass models will be presented elsewhere when three - dimensional optical fabry - perot data will become available ( chemin et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the results from the best - fit mass model for ngc 24 are illustrated in figure  [ mm ] ( left panel ) and given in table  [ mod - n24 ] .",
    "the model gives a @xmath10 of 2.5 @xmath88 0.3 for a total disk mass of @xmath93 @xmath61 .",
    "the + he gas , with a total mass of @xmath94 @xmath61 , provides only @xmath320% of the luminous mass and is therefore not very important dynamically .",
    "the parameters for the dark halo are @xmath95 kpc and @xmath96 kms@xmath6 .",
    "this gives a central density for the dark halo of 0.022 @xmath61@xmath97 .",
    "notice here that the use of a rotation curve derived by a tilted - ring model with an inclination fixed to the photometric value of 78  would slightly reduce the @xmath10 to 2.0 without changing the other parameters .",
    "the results from the best - fit mass model for ngc 45 are illustrated in figure  [ mm ] ( middle panel ) and given in table  [ mod - n45 ] .",
    "the parameters are @xmath10 @xmath98 , @xmath99 kpc and @xmath100 kms@xmath6 , which correspond to a central density for the halo of @xmath101 @xmath61@xmath102 .",

    "again , this suggests that ngc 24 is very similar to normal late - type spiral galaxies , as also claimed in  [ sec : neutrgasn24 ] .",
    "the best - fit mass model of ngc 24 gives a @xmath10 for the stellar disk of 2.5 @xmath88 0.3 . from the observed colors of 0.56 @xmath108 0.60 for ngc 24 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , sps models predict a mass - to - light ratio for the stellar disk of 1 @xmath109 @xmath10 @xmath109 1.2 ( bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is thus twice the one expected from sps models .",
    "this result remains unchanged when using @xmath10 @xmath110 , as found when using the photometric inclination instead of the kinematical value .",
    "the case of ngc 45 is even more problematic since the derived @xmath10 from the best - fit model is nearly 3 times greater than the value expected from sps models : 5.2 versus 1.7 @xmath109 @xmath10 @xmath109 2.2 ( bell & de jong 2001 ) , based on the observed @xmath111 color of 0.71 @xmath88 0.03 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "similar high @xmath10 values are often found in lsbs when fitting maximum disk models ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; swaters et al .",
    "an interpretation of these results is that the maximum disk hypothesis must not hold for lsb galaxies ( de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) . as a consequence , these galaxies appear to be dominated by dark matter at all radii when mass models preferentially use a mass - to - light ratio consistent with sps models ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; de blok et al . 2001",
    "; de blok & bosma 2002 ) .    such a model is illustrated for ngc 45 in figure  [ mm ] ( right panel ) , using a @xmath10 of 2.0 .",
    "this value is chosen to be representative of the expected @xmath10 range given by the sps models ( see above ) .",
    "indeed , it can be seen that the dark component is dominant over almost the whole stellar disk , though with the noticeable exception of the very innermost regions .",
    "this new model nevertheless highly underestimates the first two points of the rc , thus giving a worse fit ( @xmath112 ) than the best - fit model ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the quality of the fit also decreases as one goes towards the minimum disk hypothesis ( @xmath10 @xmath114 / @xmath115 ) .",
    "such a result is in agreement with what is found for other lsbs , as illustrated in de blok & bosma ( 2002 ) . for several galaxies from their sample ,",
    "the minimum disk hypothesis , or a model using a low @xmath10 , does not always provide a better fit than the maximum disk hypothesis .",
    "one finally notices that higher @xmath10 values should be expected if a correction for beam - smearing was applied or if a higher angular resolution was used for the innermost velocity points of the curves .",
    "indeed , it should give more steeply rising rotation curves in their inner parts than the ones presented here ( see e.g. swaters et al .",
    "this would worsen the discrepancy found between the low @xmath10 values from sps models and the maximum disk hypothesis . therefore , if one finally admits that the maximum disk hypothesis is ruled out for lsbs ( as favored in de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) , a more cuspy halo than the pseudo isothermal sphere should perhaps be used to better fit the inner velocity points of ngc 45 with a low @xmath10 .",
    "this claim will be tested in a forthcoming article .",
    "an optical and study of ngc 24 and ngc 45 has been presented .",
    "the main results are as follows :    \\(1 ) from the surface photometry of ngc 24 and ngc 45 , it is found that while ngc 24 is on the faint side for normal galaxies , ngc 45 can be considered as a bona fide lsb galaxy . however , both galaxies have very similar absolute magnitudes @xmath116 .",
    "\\(2 ) the distribution for ngc  24 and ngc  45 extends to @xmath117 and 2.1@xmath107 ( respectively ) at a level of @xmath118 .",
    "the extent of ngc  24 is very similar to the extent of the sculptor late - type spiral galaxies ngc 247 , ngc 300 and ngc 7793 ( 1.2 , 1.5 and 1.4@xmath107 , respectively ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the overall velocity fields of the two galaxies are very regular .",
    "ngc 45 exhibits a twist of the kinematical major axis , showing a @xmath325  variation of its major axis position angle as a function of radius .",
    "however , its disk does not have a classical warp since the inclination remains constant .",
    "\\(4 ) the rotation curves derived from the velocity fields rise slowly and flatten at a velocity of @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "it extends out to @xmath311  kpc for ngc 24 and to @xmath317  kpc for ngc 45 , which corresponds to @xmath121 scale lengths in both cases .",
    "\\(2 ) in both galaxies , the dark halo is the main contributor to the total mass of the galaxies with a contribution of more than @xmath380% at the last measured point . since the best - fit models are close to the maximum disk case , this can be considered a lower limit .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath10 of 5.2 found for ngc 45 and 2.5 for ngc 24 are high when compared with the values predicted by stellar population synthesis models for galactic disks of same colors as ngc 24 and ngc 45 .",
    "this result is similar to what is seen in other lsb galaxies .",
    "when a model for ngc 45 uses a @xmath10 of 2.0 , which value is adopted from sps models , it allows the galaxy mass to be entirely dominated by the dark component , but it also severely underestimates the velocity of the innermost points of the rotation curve .",
    "this article is the first from a series that aims at measuring the shape of the mass density profile for the dark component of ngc 24 and ngc 45 .",
    "when higher resolution optical kinematical h@xmath126  data obtained with fabry - perot interferometry become available , more accurate mass models of those galaxies will be presented .",
