    "significant rashba spin - orbit interaction results in @xmath85ev anticrossing gap between @xmath39 and @xmath40 levels which form dws @xcite .",
    "thus , there should be no conduction in the qhfm transition regime at low temperatures , consistent with vanishing resistance in wide samples .",

    "the @xmath86 gap is smaller than the cyclotron gap @xmath87  t away from the transition ( @xmath88  mev / t , or 50 - 150  @xmath30ev ) and in - gap states are extended enough to hybridize and provide a conduction path at low temperatures .",
    "these in - gap states seems to be primarily defined by weakly localized charges in the tails of the landau levels since large @xmath9 change alters the interference pattern , also pattern slowly changes over several hours even if the field is kept close to the qhfm transition .    in order to calculate transport through such channels of in - gap states we model a single qhfm dw numerically ,",
    "see supplemental material for details @xcite . in the model",
    "we assume that the primary source of localized states are potential fluctuations due to remote doping and used zero - field mobility to calculate the strength and the density of the fluctuations . in the model",
    "we also include surface roughness , which leads to the deviation of magnetic field orientation and orientation of mn spins from the @xmath89direction at high fields , effectively a magnetic disorder .",

    "@xmath93 if we use the model in fig.[dwmod]c to convert the channel conductance into measured resistance .",
    "most importantly , theoretical modeling shows that wavefunctions of the in - gap states retain the helical character of the dws , similarly to the helical properties of spin - orbit states in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "such feature provides a necessary ingredient for the formation of a spinless p - wave superconducting order in the presence of s - wave superconducting proximity effect .",
    "in this work we demonstrated gate control of qhfm transition at @xmath0 in high mobility 2d gases in cdte : mn heterostructures and investigated conducting channels formed along domain walls at the boundary between ferromagnetic domains .",
    "we show that for long channels conduction is suppressed at low temperatures , consistent with spin - orbit - induced anticrossing of landau levels , but for short ( @xmath1 m ) channels conduction saturates at low temperatures .",
    "conduction through these channels does not depend on the direction of magnetic field , unlike conduction through chiral channels formed at the boundary of different qhe states .",
    "we expect that the in - gap states , which dominate the conduction , retain the helical character of domain walls and , thus , should have large overlap with s - wave superconductors forming a building block for an electrostatically reconfigurable network of topological superconductors .",
