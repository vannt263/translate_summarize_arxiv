    "the recent claim that the spectra of quasars ( qsos ) indicates the variation of the fine structure constant , @xmath0 , on cosmologically recent times @xcite has raised considerable interest in examining putative sources of this variation . in most models a possible variation of the fine structure constant is studied by arbitrarily coupling fields to electromagnetism , as suggested by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "thus the proposals put forward sofar consider a scalar field @xcite ( with an additional coupling to dark matter and to a cosmological constant in the former case ) and quintessence @xcite .",
    "in fact , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the couplings of gravito - scalar fields , such as the axion or the dilaton , to electromagnetism naturally arise in @xmath1 supergravity in four dimensions , making this model particularly interesting .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in the latter model , the mass of these scalars can drive the accelerated expansion of the universe , transient or eternal @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider the implications for the variation of @xmath0 of a two - field quintessence model @xcite , with the quintessence fields coupled to electromagnetism , as proposed by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "there are several motivations for studying potentials with coupled scalar fields .",
    "firstly , if one envisages to describe the universe dynamics from fundamental theories , it is most likely that an ensemble of scalar fields ( moduli , axions , chiral superfields , etc ) will emerge , for instance , from the compactification process in string or braneworld scenarios .",
    "furthermore , coupled scalar fields are invoked for various desirable features they exhibit , as in the so - called hybrid inflationary and reheating models @xcite .",
    "the model of . ref .",
    "@xcite has the additional bonus of leading to transient as well as permanent solutions for the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the former solutions are desirable given that it has been recently pointed out that an eternally accelerating universe poses a challenge for string theory , at least in its present formulation , since asymptotic states are inconsistent with spacetimes that exhibit event horizons @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is argued that theories with a stable supersymmetric vacuum can not relax into a zero - energy ground state if the accelerating dynamics is guided by a single scalar field @xcite , a problem that can be circumvented in the two - field model we are considering @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the available observational bounds on the variation of @xmath0 .",
    "observations of the spectra of 128 qsos with @xmath2 suggest that , for @xmath3 , @xmath0 was smaller than at present @xcite    = ( -0.54 0.12 ) 10 ^ -5  , [ murphy ] at @xmath4 .    the most recent data is from chand _",
    "@xcite obtained via a new sample of mg  ii systems from distant quasars with redshifts in the range @xmath5 yield more stringent bounds ( @xmath6 ) , namely :    = ( -0.06 0.06 ) 10 ^ -5  , [ chand1 ] where terrestrial isotopic abundances have been assumed . if , instead , low - metalicity isotopic abundances are assumed , chand _ et al .",

    "et al . _ , eq .  ( [ murphy ] ) , is clearly smaller .",
    "notice that , in contrast with webb _",
    "et al . _ , who use different lines from different multiplets and elements , chand _ et al . _",
    "use mostly mg ii data yielding a smaller but better quality dataset .    on the other hand , the oklo natural reactor provides a bound , at @xmath7 cl ,    -0.9 10 ^ -7 < < 1.2 10 ^ -7  , for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that the use of an equilibrium neutron spectrum has been criticized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a lower bound on the variation of @xmath0 over the last two billion years is given by    + 4.5 10 ^ -8  .",
    "estimates of the age of iron meteorites ( @xmath9 ) , combined with a measurement of the os / re ratio resulting from the radioactive decay @xmath10re",
    "@xmath11os , gives @xcite    = (-8 8) 10 ^ -7  , at @xmath12 , and -24 10 ^ -7 < < 8 10 ^ -7  , at @xmath13 .",
    "notice that , if the variation of the fine structure constant is linear , the murphy _",
    "_ observations of qso absorption spectra and of geochemical tests from meteorites are incompatible given that the former yields @xmath14 at @xmath15 , while the latter leads to @xmath16 at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , this problem may not exist if one uses the chand _ et al . _",
    "dataset .",
    "moreover , observations of the hyperfine frequencies of the @xmath17cs and @xmath18rb atoms in their electronic ground state , using several laser cooled atomic fountain clocks , give , at present ( @xmath19 ) @xcite ( see also @xcite )    < 4.2 10 ^ -15  ^-1  , where the dot represents differentiation with respect to cosmic time .",
    "tigher bounds arise from the remeasurement of the @xmath20 transition of the atomic hydrogen and comparison with a previous measurement with respect to the ground state hyperfine splitting in @xmath17cs and combination with the drift of an optical transition frequency in @xmath21hg@xmath22 , that is @xcite :    = ( -0.9 4.2 ) 10 ^ -15  ^-1  .",
    "there are also constraints coming from cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , where    10 ^ -2  , at @xmath23 @xcite , and from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ,    - 6 10 ^ -4 < / < 1.5 10 ^ -4  , at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we should take into account the equivalence principle experiments , which imply @xcite    10 ^ -3  , [ zetaf ] where @xmath25 is the coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic fields and @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the reduced planck mass @xmath28 and @xmath29 the corresponding analogue in the scalar sector .",
    "notice that not all models put forward sofar satisfy the abovementioned bounds .",
    "for instance , quintessence models like the last one in @xcite and the @xmath1 supergravity models in four dimensions are not consistent with webb _ et al . _ data . in the following",
    ", we shall present our model and show that it is consistent with all the available data for a suitable choice of the model parameters .",
    "we shall study the time evolution of @xmath0 in a model where two homogeneous scalar fields are minimally coupled to electromagnetism .",
    "this evolution follows from the effective action , in natural units ( @xmath30 ) ,    s = d^4x   , [ action ] where @xmath31 is the lagrangian density for the background matter ( cdm , baryons and radiation ) , which we consider homogeneous , corresponding to a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state @xmath32 , with @xmath33 constant ( @xmath34 ; @xmath35 for radiation and @xmath36 for dust ) ; @xmath37 is the lagrangian density for the scalar fields    _ q = 12 ^_+ 12 ^_- v ( , ) .",
    "we consider the two - field quintessence model with potential @xcite    v ( , ) = e^- p ( , )  , [ pot ] where p ( , ) & = & a  + ( -_*)^2+b  ( -_*)^2 + & &  + c  ( -_*)^2 + d  ( -_*)^2  . [ pot1 ] potentials of the type exponential times a polynomial , involving one single scalar field , have been considered before , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "for a transient acceleration model with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the upper panel , the boxes represent the qso bounds given in eqs .",
    "( [ chand1 ] ) ( top box ) , ( [ chand2 ] ) ( middle box ) and ( [ murphy ] ) ( lower box ) . also shown is the qso absorption systems dataset of chand _",
    "( table 3 of ref .",
    "the lower panel details the behaviour of @xmath0 for small values of @xmath43 .",
    "the lower left plot shows the oklo bound ( dash - dotted lines ) and the right one the meteorite bounds ( dash - dotted and dotted lines correspond to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively).,width=302 ]     but for a permanent acceleration model with @xmath44 and @xmath45.,width=302 ]    integrating eqs .",
    "( [ fried ] ) , one finds that there are essentially two realistic types of solutions , corresponding to either transient or permanent acceleration , as illustrated in figure [ fig : fields ] .",
    "it is possible to obtain permanent or transient vacuum domination , satisfying present bounds on observable cosmological parameters , for a rather broad range of parameters of the potential , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "permanent vacuum domination takes place when at least the @xmath46 field settles at the minimum of the potential ; soon after , @xmath47 monotonically increases until it reaches its asymptotic value . for transient vacuum domination ( which occurs either when the potential has no local minimum or when @xmath46 arrives at the minimum with enough kinetic energy to roll over the potential barrier ) the @xmath46 field increases monotonically and @xmath47 slightly decreases . the contribution of @xmath48 , which controls the presence and location of the minimum , is only important at recent times , since at early epochs the exponential factor dominates and the model behavior depends essentially on parameter @xmath49 .",
    "notice that , as @xmath49 increases , the model becomes more similar to @xmath50cdm at early times .",
    "the interaction term between the scalar fields and the electromagnetic field is , as suggested in ref .",

    "therefore , the variation of the fine structure constant , @xmath54 , is given by    = _ 1 ( - _ 0 ) + _ 2 ( - _ 0 ) . [ delalpha ]    notice that the upper bound on @xmath55 , see eq .",
    "( [ zetaf ] ) , implies that @xmath56 because of the different definition for @xmath57 used in @xcite , namely , @xmath58 .",
    "the rate of variation of @xmath0 , at present , can be written as    = - ( _ 1 d dy  + _ 2 d dy ) h_0 , [ dotalpha ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the value of the hubble constant at present , @xmath61 .",
    "we adopt the method of choosing the model parameters so as to satisfy a set of priors for the cosmological parameters ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) and then adjust the coupling parameters , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in order to satisfy the bounds on the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the priors chosen above are consistent with a combination of wmap data and other cmb experiments ( acbar and cbi ) , 2dfgrs measurements and lyman @xmath0 forest data , which gives @xcite : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 cl ) , corresponding to the best fit for the observed universe .    for large @xmath43 ,",
    "the tightest bound on dark energy arises from nucleosynthesis , @xmath73 , implying that @xmath74 @xcite . considering a possible underestimation of systematic errors ,",
    "one gets a more conservative bound , @xmath75 at @xmath76 , which corresponds to @xmath77 . for the model parameters chosen in this work ( see below ) , we get @xmath78 .",
    "the model is also consistent with cmbr observations .",
    "recent cmbr data imply that @xmath79 at last scattering @xcite , which is less stringent than the nucleosynthesis bound and is clearly obeyed by our model .",
    "we have also computed the angle subtended by the sound horizon at last scattering , obtaining @xmath80 , clearly within wmap bounds on this quantity @xcite : @xmath81 .     for a transient acceleration model with @xmath41 and @xmath82 ( full line ) ,",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 ( dashed line ) , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "line and box conventions are those of figs .",
    "[ fig : transient1 ] and [ fig : permanent1].,width=302 ]     but for a permanent acceleration model with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( full line ) , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( dashed line ) , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( dash - dotted line).,width=302 ]    as an example of transient acceleration models , we consider the following set of parameters : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , with @xmath41 and @xmath82 . in this case , the variation of @xmath0 is in agreement with both the oklo and meteorite bounds , as can be seen in the lower panel of figure [ fig : transient1 ] . in the upper panel ,",
    "we see that the fit to chand _ et al .",
    "_ qso data ( where terrestrial isotopic abundances have been assumed ) is acceptable : we get @xmath100 ( notice that , in the computation of the @xmath101 , only 8 free variables should be taken into account since one potential parameter is tuned in order to have the observed dark energy density at the present ) .",
    "also the constraint from atomic clock measurements is verified as we obtain    = -4.5 10 ^ -17  ^-1  .",
    "moreover , the model gives variations in @xmath0 during bbn and at the last scattering surface well within the bounds stated earlier , e.g. we get    & & ( cmbr ) = -2.7 10 ^ -6  , + & & ( bbn ) = -1.1 10 ^ -6  .    for models with permanent acceleration",
    ", however , consistency with qso spectra and oklo data is problematic .",
    "our results are illustrated in figure [ fig : permanent1 ] , where we have chosen @xmath93 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , for @xmath44 and @xmath88 .",
    "we get & & = 5.2 10 ^ -17  ^-1 + & & ( cmbr ) = 4.5 10 ^ -5 + & & ( bbn ) = 2.9 10 ^ -4 and @xmath108 .",
    "notice that the bbn bound is not respected in this case .",
    "it is clear that the evolution of @xmath0 , past and future , is a reflection of the dynamics of the fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which depends crucially on whether acceleration is permanent or transient . in the example of figure [ fig : transient1 ]",
    ", @xmath0 is increasing monotonically and will continue to do so .",
    "however if @xmath109 , it is the @xmath47 field that determines the evolution ; hence , in that case , @xmath0 may decrease in the future . for permanent acceleration solutions",
    ", the sign of @xmath67 determines the future evolution of @xmath0 , since @xmath47 has more dynamics than @xmath46 . hence ,",
    "for the example of figure [ fig : permanent1 ] , @xmath0 will increase in the future since @xmath110 ; the oscillating behavior of @xmath0 reflects the oscillations of @xmath46 before it settles at the minimum of the potential .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : transient2 ] and [ fig : permanent2 ] we show that , increasing the couplings to the electromagnetic field , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , it is also possible to fit murphy _",
    "_ qso data @xcite , both in the transient and permanent acceleration regimes",
    ". however , as should be expected , it is more difficult to respect the oklo and meteorites bounds in both cases .",
    "in this work , we have studied the variation of the fine structure constant in the context of a quintessence model with two coupled scalar fields .",
    "we find that transient acceleration models can fit the latest qso data and comply with the upper bounds on @xmath111 from the oklo reactor , meteorite analysis and the atomic clock measurements . for permanent acceleration models , however , it is more difficult to fit the qso data and satisfy the oklo , meteorite and bbn bounds simultaneously .",
    "we have studied the sensitivity of our results to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the couplings of quintessence fields with electromagnetism , and we have found that , in order to be consistent with the data , these parameters must be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the upper bound implied by the equivalence principle .    on a more general ground , we could say that establishing whether there is a variation of the fine structure constant and , in the affirmative case , identifying its origin , remains a difficult task before a deeper analysis of the systematic errors of the observations and studies of the degeneracies with the various cosmological parameters .",
