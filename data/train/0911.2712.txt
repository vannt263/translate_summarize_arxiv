    "the study of magnetic activity in fully convective low mass stars and brown dwarfs",
    "( spectral types late - m , l , and t ) has progressed in recent years from the question of whether these objects produce stable fields to a quantitative investigation of how the fields are produced and dissipated . unlike the solar - type @xmath17 dynamo , which operates in the transition region between the radiative and convective zones ( the tachocline ; @xcite ) ,",
    "objects later than spectral type m3 can only support a convective dynamo .",
    "numerical simulations of such a mechanism are still at an early stage , but they suggest that large - scale axisymmetric fields can indeed be generated in fully convective objects , at least for conditions that roughly correspond to mid - m dwarfs ( @xmath18 m@xmath19 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , observational constraints on the scale , geometry , and dissipation of the fields are essential .",
    "several observational techniques are now being used to address these questions , including zeeman measurements in stokes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which probe the strength of the integrated surface fields and their large - scale topology , respectively @xcite , and activity indicators such as radio , x - ray , and h@xmath0 emission , which trace the dissipation of the field and hence its strength and geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the activity indicators also provide insight into magnetic heating , and their temporal variability can potentially trace the field properties on small scales that are inaccessible to the zeeman measurements .",
    "the current results from zeeman measurements point to a transition from mainly toroidal and non - axisymmetric fields in m0m3 dwarfs to predominantly poloidal axisymmetric fields in mid - m dwarfs @xcite , with field strength of @xmath22 kg @xcite .",
    "studies of activity indicators point to a rapid decline in x - ray and h@xmath0 activity ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) at about spectral type m7 , and uniform radio luminosity ( i.e. , increasing @xmath24 ) at least to spectral type l3 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the disparate trends may be due to a decoupling of the magnetic fields from the increasingly neutral atmospheres , or to a shift in the magnetic field configuration .    while x - ray and radio observations provide powerful insight into the nature of the magnetic fields , h@xmath0 chromospheric emission , which traces gas at temperatures of @xmath25 k ,",
    "is more easily accessible for large samples as a by - product of standard optical spectroscopic observations . in recent years ,",
    "large spectroscopic samples of m dwarfs have become available through dedicated studies and large - scale surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "these extensive samples have led to several important results concerning chromospheric activity .",
    "first , the fraction of objects that exhibit h@xmath0 emission increases rapidly from @xmath26 in the k5m3 dwarfs to a peak of @xmath27 around spectral type m7 , followed by a subsequent decline to a few percent in the l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "second , while the level of activity increases with both rotation and youth in f  k stars , it reaches a saturated value of @xmath8 in m0m6 dwarfs , followed by a rapid decline to @xmath28 by spectral type l0 @xcite , and a breakdown of the rotation - activity relation @xcite . finally , a small fraction ( @xmath29 ) of late - m and l dwarfs",
    "have been serendipitously observed to exhibit h@xmath0 flares that reach the saturated emission levels found in the early - m dwarfs @xcite .    to uniformly address the latter point",
    " h@xmath0 variability  we recently carried out spectroscopic monitoring observations of about 40 m4m8 dwarfs with known h@xmath0 emission @xcite . with observations of about 1 hr per source and a time resolution of @xmath30 min , we found that about @xmath31 of these objects exhibit h@xmath0 variability on a wide range of timescales , ranging in amplitude from tens of percent up to a factor of about 5 .",
    "indeed , the timescale distribution for variability `` events '' is nearly flat from 10 min to 1 hr , with fewer events on timescales below 10 min .",
    "the variability amplitudes follow an exponential distribution with a characteristic scale of @xmath32 . finally , we found tentative evidence for increased variability with later spectral type .    here , we extend our study of h@xmath0 variability by three orders of magnitude using sdss time - resolved spectroscopic data for a sample of 52,392 m0m9 dwarfs ( knapp et al .",
    "2009 in preparation ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "for the first time we take advantage of the individual 15 min exposures , with a typical number of 3 exposures per source . using these data",
    "we can thus probe h@xmath0 variability on timescale of @xmath33 min to @xmath34 hr .",
    "in this paper we focus on the h@xmath0 variability amplitudes and their relation to the h@xmath0 activity level ( @xmath7 ) and spectral type .",
    "we also re - investigate the relation between h@xmath0 activity and spectral type using the individual 15 min spectra , rather than the sdss pipeline - combined spectra , which were used in previous work @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we define our sample selection and describe the analysis method for measuring h@xmath0 equivalent widths .",
    "the results for h@xmath0 variability and activity are described in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "future papers will focus on the variability timescales , the highest amplitude events , the variability of other chromospheric emission lines ( e.g. , higher - order balmer lines , h&k , lines ) , and the relation between chromospheric variability and various source properties , such as age .",
    "the details of the sample selection are described in paper i , where preliminary characteristics of the sample are also described . here",
    "we provide a summary of our selection technique .",
    "we examined the combined spectra of all point sources in the sdss dr7 database with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 mag ( uncorrected for interstellar extinction ) . using a set of spectral templates , including the cool star templates from @xcite",
    ", we determined the best - fit spectral type for each object and removed all objects with stellar spectra earlier than k , or with the spectra of galaxies or quasars .",
    "we further removed spectra determined to be deficient according to the following criteria : inadequate signal - to - noise ratio ; poor sky subtraction ; large wavelength regions with missing data ; and contamination by light from a nearby object or by emission from diffuse interstellar ionized gas .",
    "the resulting list contains 59,427 stars .",
    "after removal of stars of spectral type k , l and t , and removal of stars with subdwarf spectra , we find a total of 52,392 m dwarf stars .",
    "using the coordinates of these objects , and their plate and fiber identifications , we obtained the individual 15-min processed spectroscopic exposures .",
    "the total number of exposures is 205,823 with a range of @xmath38 exposures per source .",
    "the distribution of the number of exposures is shown in figure  [ fig : number ] .      to measure the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) in each individual spectrum",
    "we follow a three - step process . first , we determine whether h@xmath0 emission is significantly detected .",
    "we define the minimum required h@xmath0 emission line significance as @xmath39 relative to the continuum level root - mean - square ( rms ) noise .",
    "this condition ensures that the h@xmath0 emission line is significantly detected regardless of the signal - to - noise ratio , and hence the apparent brightness of the source ( a combination of its spectral type and distance ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : threshold ] we plot the median @xmath39 threshold as a function of spectral type . for spectral types m0m4 the threshold is about 1  , but it then climbs rapidly to about 3   for m6 and about 6   for m9 .",
    "this spectral type dependent threshold inevitably leads to different h@xmath0 detection statistics as a function of spectral type compared to previous analyses , which used a fixed threshold of 1   equivalent width from m0 to l0 @xcite ; see  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we note that since the continuum flux in the h@xmath0 region declines with later spectral type , the use of a fixed equivalent width threshold allows weaker , and less significant `` lines '' to be counted as genuine detections .",
    "our spectral type dependent threshold therefore provides more robust statistics on the h@xmath0 properties at a fixed statistical significance .",
    "a total of 21,200 spectra exhibit h@xmath0 emission at @xmath40 significance ( @xmath41 of all the available exposures ) .",
    "second , we identify exposures with possible cosmic ray hits in the h@xmath0 line region using the standard sdss pipeline flags .",
    "we find @xmath42 exposures with such flags , or about @xmath43 of all spectra . from visual inspection",
    ", however , we find that in about half of the cases apparently genuine bright h@xmath0 emission lines are flagged as cosmic rays . as a result",
    ", we perform a more robust cosmic ray rejection using one of the two following criteria in addition to the pipeline flag : ( i ) the flux of a flagged pixel within @xmath44 of the h@xmath0 line center is more than twice the maximum unflagged pixel flux , or ( ii ) more than half of the pixels in the h@xmath0 line and continuum region ( @xmath45  ) are flagged by the pipeline .",
    "the former criterion allows us to distinguish cosmic rays with a narrow width from genuine h@xmath0 emission lines whose width is set by the spectral resolution .",
    "the latter criterion eliminates exposures with questionable flux measurements in the h@xmath0 line region . using these additional criteria we reduce the number of rejected exposures to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 of all exposures ) .    to evaluate the statistical efficacy of this procedure in removing cosmic rays and in avoiding the removal of genuine h@xmath0 emission lines",
    ", we estimate the cosmic ray hit fraction in @xmath48   windows located in regions of the spectra that are devoid of emission features . using a random set of about @xmath49 objects that cover the full spectral type range of our study , we find that the expected cosmic ray hit fraction in the h@xmath0 line region is about @xmath50 , in good agreement with the fraction determined by our cosmic ray rejection criteria .",
    "this indicates that our sample is not biased by cosmic rays , and furthermore that we are not missing a substantial fraction of the large amplitude variability events due to cosmic ray rejection .    finally , to measure the h@xmath0 line equivalent width ( ew ) we simultaneously fit the h@xmath0 line with a gaussian profile and the continuum region with a third - order legendre polynomial . the uncertainty in the equivalent width ( @xmath51 ) is determined over the same spectral region using the error spectrum associated with each exposure . for spectra that do not pass the @xmath39 threshold",
    ", we use this value as an upper limit .",
    "these upper limits are crucial for assessing the range of activity for m dwarfs that exhibit a mix of active and inactive spectra .",
    "example spectra with no h@xmath0 emission , constant h@xmath0 emission , and variable h@xmath0 emission are shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] .",
    "in our sample of 52,392 m dwarfs we find 8,223 objects ( @xmath52 ) with at least one spectroscopic exposure that exhibits h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this is verified by the independent analysis presented in paper i , which used the combined spectra .",
    "the detection fraction as a function of spectral type is shown in figure  [ fig : specdetections ] .",
    "for comparison , we also show the detection fractions from @xcite who used the pipeline - combined sdss spectra and a fixed 1 detection threshold . as in previous studies ,",
    "we find a rapid rise in the h@xmath0 detection fraction from a level of a few percent in the range m0m3 to about @xmath53 in m4 .",
    "however , beyond spectral type m4 our results diverge from previous studies .",
    "namely , we find that the detection fraction rises to a peak of about @xmath54 in m5m6 , and subsequently declines steadily to about @xmath55 in m9 .",
    "this is in contrast to the continued rise from m4 to m8 ( with a peak fraction of nearly @xmath56 ) found by @xcite .",
    "this divergence is largely due to our spectral type dependent detection threshold ( figure  [ fig : threshold ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that this is the case by applying our threshold to the distributions of @xmath57 from @xcite , using their equivalent width conversion factors .",
    "we find that the resulting reduction in active fraction is about @xmath58 , and it explains the difference for spectral types m5m7 .",
    "we still find a difference of about @xmath53 in the m8 and m9 bins .",
    "it is possible that the continued rise found by @xcite and @xcite was due to further contamination caused by their use of a fixed equivalent width threshold .    of the 8,223 objects with at least one active spectrum , @xmath6 exhibit h@xmath0 emission in all of the available exposures .",
    "the fraction of active objects as a function of the h@xmath0 detection fraction is shown in figure  [ fig : detectionpercent ] .",
    "this distribution does not take into account the fraction of objects in the sample with various numbers of exposures ( figure  [ fig : number ] ) .",
    "for example , the peaks at h@xmath0 detection fractions of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 reflect the large number of objects with 3 exposures .",
    "conversely , the low fraction of objects with h@xmath0 detection fractions of @xmath62 simply reflects the small number of objects with a sufficiently large number of exposures to populate these bins ( i.e. , more than 5 exposures ) .    even without correcting for this effect",
    "we find that for the objects with a small number of exposures ( @xmath63 ) , which occupy well defined bins , there is a systematic decline in the fraction of objects as a function of increased h@xmath0 detection fraction .",
    "for example , the bins corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath60 h@xmath0 detection fractions ( dominated by objects with 3 exposures ) exhibit a decline in the fraction of active objects from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , there is a systematic decline in the fraction of stars with h@xmath0 detections fractions of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( with values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath70 , respectively ) , and a decline for objects with detection fractions of @xmath71 to @xmath72 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the rise at @xmath56 detection fraction partly reflects the combined contribution from sources with a wide range of exposure numbers , but also appears to be a genuine effect ( some of the objects in this bin have steady h@xmath0 emission ; see figure  [ fig : examples ] ) .",
    "the decrease in the fraction of objects as a function of increased h@xmath0 detection fraction may reflect a typical timescale for the variability , such that variability on a @xmath75 min timescale is more common than on @xmath76 hr timescale .    to appropriately normalize the distribution for the fraction of objects with different numbers of exposures ,",
    "we divide each h@xmath0 detection fraction bin by the number of sources that can potentially populate this bin .",
    "for example , the bin at an h@xmath0 detection fraction of 0.5 is normalized by the total number of sources with an even number of exposures , while the bin centered at 0.35 is normalized by the number of objects with exposure numbers divisible by 3 .",
    "the resulting normalized distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : wdetectionpercent ] .",
    "we find a relatively uniform distribution below an h@xmath0 detection fraction of about 1/3 at a level of about @xmath77 , followed by a decline to about @xmath78 for detection fractions of @xmath79 ; the number of objects with an h@xmath0 detection fraction of 1 remains unchanged by definition .",
    "these detection statistics alone already point to a significant level of variability in m dwarfs .",
    "even if we make the most conservative assumption that all of the objects with a @xmath56 h@xmath0 detection fraction are non - variable , the fraction of all m dwarfs with variable h@xmath0 emission is at least @xmath80 .",
    "before we turn to a discussion of the h@xmath0 _ variability _ , we investigate the h@xmath0 _ activity _ trends . a comprehensive analysis of m dwarf h@xmath0 activity as a function of spectral type based on sdss pipeline - combined spectra was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ fig : logbol ] we plot @xmath81 as a function of spectral type for each object .",
    "we use both the median and the maximum values , and find similar trends .",
    "the median @xmath7 value for spectral types m0m4 is roughly constant at @xmath82 , followed by a decline to a value of about @xmath9 in m7m9 .",
    "these values are similar to those found by @xcite . for the distribution of maximum @xmath7",
    "we find a nearly constant value @xmath83 for m0m4 , followed by a decline to @xmath84 in m7m9 .",
    "thus , the maximum @xmath7 values follow the same trend as the median values , but the difference between the median and maximum values appears to increase with later spectral type , indicative of an increase in the h@xmath0 variability .    in figure",
    "[ fig : logbolspectral ] we plot the distribution of the median @xmath7 values in separate spectral type bins .",
    "the shift in the peak of the distribution to lower values as a function of later spectral type is apparent , and follows the same trend found by @xcite .",
    "however , unlike these authors we find a wider dispersion in the early spectral types , primarily as a result of the significantly larger number of objects in our sample .",
    "the standard deviation values range from about 0.2 to 0.28 with no clear trend .",
    "we now turn to the primary focus of our study  h@xmath0 variability .",
    "we quantify the variability of each object using the ratio of maximum to minimum h@xmath0 equivalent width , @xmath85 , as well as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean equivalent width , @xmath86 . in the case of @xmath12",
    "we calculate a lower limit on the variability when at least one equivalent width upper limit is available , while for @xmath87 we treat the upper limits as @xmath39 detections ; the resulting values are thus lower limits on the variability . within the sample of objects with h@xmath0 emission in at least one spectrum ( 8,223 objects ) we find that about @xmath88 are consistent with steady h@xmath0 emission within the uncertainties on the individual h@xmath0 equivalent width measurements .",
    "this fraction is relatively uniform across the full spectral type range of m0m9 , with a possible mild decline in the later spectral types .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12 values as a function of spectral type is shown in figure  [ fig : maxminlinear ] .",
    "for each spectral type bin we separate objects with a @xmath56 detection fraction from those with at least one upper limit . in both cases",
    "we find a clear rise in @xmath12 as a function of spectral type , from a maximum value of about 5 for m0m3 to about @xmath89 for m5m8 , followed by a possible decline in spectral type m9 .",
    "indeed , the objects that exhibit an h@xmath0 variability of @xmath90 are nearly all m5m9 dwarfs . for the objects with a @xmath56 detection fraction",
    "we find that @xmath91 have @xmath92 , while @xmath93 have @xmath94 .",
    "for the objects with partial detections the fractions are @xmath95 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "these fractions , and the overall wider distribution of @xmath12 values for objects with partial detections , indicate that objects with intermittent h@xmath0 emission produce higher variability ratios than those with persistent h@xmath0 emission . to investigate this point in more detail ,",
    "we plot the distributions of @xmath12 values binned by detection fraction for all objects with 3 and 4 exposures ( figures  [ fig:3exposures ] and [ fig:4exposures ] ) . in both cases",
    "we find that the distributions for objects with partial detections are significantly broader than for objects with @xmath61 and @xmath96 detections .",
    "we further find that the @xmath12 values follows an exponential distribution ( figure  [ fig : maxminlinear ] ) .",
    "for the objects with a @xmath56 detection fraction we find @xmath97 $ ] for @xmath98 .",
    "this result is identical to what we previously found for a sample of about 40 objects , which reached a maximum value of @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sample was too small to provide constraints on larger variability ratios .",
    "here we find that for higher ratios ( @xmath100 ) , the distribution appears to flatten to an exponential profile with @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12 lower limits is generally flatter , and appears to follow a single exponential profile with @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "since these are lower limits , we conclude that the overall distribution of @xmath12 values for m dwarfs is an exponential with a characteristic scale of @xmath103 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12 values for each spectral type is shown in figure  [ fig : maxminspectral ] .",
    "the more pronounced tail of large @xmath12 values for spectral types @xmath104 is evident .",
    "in addition , we also find a systematic increase in the median of the distribution , from about 1.8 for m0m4 to about 2.5 for m6m9 . in figure  [ fig : rew_m04_m59 ] we show the same distributions , but combined for spectral types m0m4 and m5m9 . in both cases",
    "the distributions are well fit by an exponential profile with a characteristic scale of @xmath105 for m0m4 and @xmath106 for m5m9 .",
    "this indicates that high amplitude variability is more common in late - m dwarfs .",
    "finally , similar variability trends are found using @xmath87 , with a steady increase from a maximum value of about 0.4 for m0 to about 1 for m5m7 , followed by a decline to about 0.7 for m8m9 ( figure  [ fig : std ] ) . as in the case of @xmath12 ,",
    "the distribution for partial detections is broader than for objects with @xmath56 detections , which follows an exponential with @xmath107 .",
    "the distributions for each spectral sub - type are shown in figure  [ fig : stdspectral ] and exhibit an increase in @xmath87 from a median value of about 0.28 for m0m3 to about 0.4 for m6m9 .",
    "we study the variability of the h@xmath0 chromospheric emission line in m dwarfs using the individual 15 min spectroscopic exposures from sdss for an unprecedentedly large sample of 52,392 stars .",
    "the typical timescale probed by these data is 15 min to 1 hr . about @xmath5 of the sources exhibit h@xmath0 emission in at least one exposure , and of those about @xmath6 have h@xmath0 emission in all of the available exposures .",
    "only @xmath88 of all the objects with h@xmath0 emission are consistent with steady emission , spread relatively uniformly from m0 to m9 . the detection fraction as a function of spectral type exhibits the known trend of a sharp increase from a few percent in m0m3 to tens of percent in later objects . however , unlike the results of previous studies based on sdss pipeline - combined spectra and a fixed equivalent width threshold of 1   @xcite , we find a peak detection fraction of @xmath108 , with a steady decline beyond m6 .",
    "we attribute this trend to our use of a spectral type dependent detection threshold of @xmath109   ( @xmath39 ) in m5m9 objects .",
    "the h@xmath0 variability , quantified in terms of @xmath12 , exhibits a substantial increase with later spectral type . for m dwarfs as a whole",
    ", the distribution of @xmath12 values appears to follow an exponential with @xmath102 $ ] ; the characteristic scale is about 2.7 for m5m9 .",
    "we also find that objects with partial detections exhibit a wider distribution of @xmath12 values than those with persistent h@xmath0 emission .",
    "these results indicate that h@xmath0 variability increases with later spectral type , even as h@xmath0 activity declines , and that m dwarfs with intermittent h@xmath0 activity are more variable than those with persistent h@xmath0 emission .    in the context of chromospheric heating",
    ", these trends suggest that the magnetic energy input typically varies by a factor of about 2 on timescales of @xmath75 min to @xmath34 hr . moreover , the increased variability as a function of later spectral type , with a particularly large increase beyond spectral types m3m4 , hints at an overall shift in the magnetic field , leading to less uniform field dissipation .",
    "taken at face value , this conclusion suggests that the relative contribution from small scales , which are likely to dissipate on short timescales , increases for later m dwarfs .",
    "this possible trend is in conflict with preliminary results from zeeman measurements of a few objects in the range m0m5 , which point to an increase in the relative contribution from large - scale fields @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the increase in h@xmath0 variability , particularly for sources with intermittent emission , may be due to an increase in the stochastic dissipation of the field in the presence of increasingly neutral atmospheres . in this scenario ,",
    "heating of the bulk chromospheric plasma is suppressed by the decoupling of the field from the atmosphere ( leading to a decline in @xmath7 ) , but small - scale stochastic heating still takes place ( leading to an increase in the h@xmath0 variability ) . the role of these two scenarios may become clearer as samples of late - m dwarfs with zeeman measurements become available .",
