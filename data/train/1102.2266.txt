    "in 1969 boris chirikov @xcite proposed what became one of the most important and extensively studied systems in nonlinear dynamics and in the theory of hamiltonian systems and area - preserving maps @xcite , namely the chirikov standard map .",
    "the model describes the motion of a kicked rotator .",
    "applications of the model can be made in different fields of science including solid state physics @xcite , statistical mechanics @xcite and accelerator physics @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied in relation to problems of quantum mechanics and quantum chaos @xcite , plasma physics @xcite and many others .",
    "the standard map is a dynamical system in which the nonlinearity given by a sine function is controlled by a parameter @xmath0 . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "if @xmath0 is small enough the structure of the phase space is mixed in the sense that kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) invariant tori and islands are observed coexisting with chaotic seas @xcite .",
    "as the parameter @xmath0 increases and becomes larger than @xmath1 , the last invariant spanning curve disappears and the system presents a global chaotic component where a chaotic orbit spreads over the phase space .",
    "however , the introduction of dissipation in the model changes the mixed structure and the system exhibits attractors @xcite .",
    "we consider two different ranges of dissipation namely : ( i ) strong dissipation  the situation where the variable action loses more than @xmath2 of its value upon a kick  where period doubling bifurcation cascade is observed and the feigenbaum coefficient is numerically obtained and ; ( ii ) weak dissipation where the average action exhibits scaling features @xcite . here",
    "we propose a new universal function that describes the scaling behavior of the average action by the knowledge of a single critical exponent , the so called acceleration exponent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe all the necessary details to obtain the two - dimensional map that describes the dynamics of the system and also we present and discuss our numerical results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the standard map has the following form ( see e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the amplitude of the delta - function kicks ( pulses ) with period @xmath4 .",
    "the equation of motion is given by @xmath5 assuming that @xmath6 be the values of the variable immediately after the @xmath7 kick , @xmath8 represent their values after the @xmath9 kick , and introducing the dissipation parameter @xmath10 @xcite , the dissipative standard map is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 $ ] is the dissipation parameter . if @xmath13 all the results for the hamiltonian area - preserving standard map are recovered .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath14 the results for the one - dimensional sine - circle map are obtained @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall consider @xmath15 .",
    "the system is area preserving only when @xmath13 since the determinant of the jacobian matrix is @xmath16 .",
    "another consequence of the dissipation is that the map ( [ eq3 ] ) is periodic only in @xmath17 , while the action @xmath18 ranges between @xmath19 .     and",
    "( b ) @xmath17 both plotted against the parameter @xmath0 . in",
    "( c ) it is shown the lyapunov exponent associated to ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the damping coefficients used for the construction of the figures ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) were @xmath20 . ]    in this paper we will consider two situations for @xmath10 , namely , strong dissipation and weak dissipation .",
    "the strong dissipation refers to the situation in which the action variable @xmath18 loses more than @xmath2 of its value upon a kick .",
    "we have considered the case @xmath20 . to explore some typical behavior we have used as initial conditions @xmath21 and @xmath22 and investigated its attraction to periodic orbits , and looked at the bifurcations as @xmath0 varies in the range where we have global chaos if @xmath13 .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows the behavior of the asymptotic action plotted against the control parameter @xmath0 , where a sequence of period doubling bifurcations is evident .",
    "a similar sequence is also observed for the asymptotic variable @xmath17 , as it is shown in fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "there are three small sequences of bifurcations , however we are not interested in their behavior here , but the same procedure can also be applied to them .",
    "observe that , of course , the bifurcations of the same period in ( a ) and ( b ) happen for the same value of the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) , as the parameter @xmath0 approaches the point of bifurcation , the lyapunov exponent approaches zero . as discussed in @xcite",
    "the lyapunov exponents are defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the jacobian matrix evaluated over the orbit @xmath27 .",
    "if at least one of the @xmath28 is positive then the orbit is classified as chaotic .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ( c ) the behavior of the lyapunov exponents corresponding to both figs .",
    "( [ fig1])(a , b ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that when the bifurcations happen , the exponent @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "such a behavior occurs because the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix become complex numbers on unit circle .",
    "the lyapunov exponents between @xmath30 correspond to the small sequence of bifurcation observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a , b ) for the same range of the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in some regions the lyapunov exponent assumes a constant and negative value .     with @xmath31 .",
    "( b ) basin of attraction for the attracting fixed points ( sinks ) of period 1 ( red and black ) , 2 ( cyan ) , 3 ( maroon ) and 4 ( green ) .",
    "the control parameters used to construct the basin of attraction were @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ]     as function of @xmath33 for different values of the control parameter @xmath10 .",
    "( b ) their collapse onto a single universal plot . ]     as function of the control parameter @xmath10 .",
    "( b ) behavior of the crossover number @xmath34 vs. @xmath10 . ]",
    "the period doubling cascade was discovered by may @xcite in 1976 and by grossmann and thomae in 1977 @xcite and later it was discovered by feigenbaum @xcite that there is a universal feature along the bifurcations . the period doubling bifurcations converge geometrically to the chaos border .",
    "the procedure used to obtain the feigenbaum constant @xmath35 is as follows : let @xmath36 represent the control parameter value at which period-1 gives birth to a period-2 orbit , @xmath37 is the value where period-2 changes to period-4 and so on . in general",
    "the parameter @xmath38 corresponds to the control parameter value at which a period-@xmath39 orbit is born .",
    "thus , the feigenbaum s @xmath35 is written as @xmath40 the theoretical value for the feigenbaum constant @xmath35 is @xmath41 . considering the numerical data obtained through the lyapunov exponents calculation",
    ", the feigenbaum s @xmath35 obtained for the dissipative standard map is @xmath42 .",
    "since the numerical results are very hard to be obtained for bifurcations of higher orders , we have considered in our simulations only the bifurcations up to eleventh order , but still our result is in a good agreement with the feigenbaum s universal @xmath35 .     as a function of @xmath33 for different values of the control parameter @xmath10 .",
    "( b ) their collapse onto a single universal plot . ]     as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "( b ) behavior of the crossover number @xmath34 vs. @xmath10 . ]",
    "as we have shown for strong dissipation the system exhibits a sequence of period doubling bifurcations and for one of them we have found the feigenbaum s @xmath35 .",
    "now , consider the parameter @xmath0 such that the conservative dynamics has the mixed phase space . when dissipation is taken into account the mixed structure",
    "is changed .",
    "then , an elliptical fixed point ( generally surrounded by kam islands ) turns into a sink .",
    "regions of the chaotic sea might be replaced by chaotic attractors . in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) the behavior of the phase space for the conservative dynamics @xmath43 with @xmath31 is shown . as it is well known for such a value of",
    "the parameter @xmath0 the last invariant torus is destroyed and the phase space has only kam islands and a large chaotic sea .",
    "figure [ fig11](b ) shows the basin of attraction where the main fixed points are of period 1 ( red and black ) , 2 ( cyan ) , 3 ( maroon ) and 4 ( green ) . the dissipation parameter is @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure used to construct the basin of attraction was to divide both @xmath18 and @xmath17 into grids of @xmath44 parts each , thus leading to a total of @xmath45 different initial conditions .",
    "each initial condition was iterated up to @xmath46 .",
    "apart from the mentioned periodic attractors there are many others , which , however , are difficult to find and display , because their basins of attraction are very small . a more systematic overview of the dynamical phase diagram in the parameter - space @xmath47 , is given in reference @xcite .",
    "when the control parameter @xmath0 is sufficiently large , all the regular regions are destroyed and the phase space for the conservative case is fully chaotic . in this sense we will study some dynamical properties in the regime of @xmath48 but taking into account weak dissipation .",
    "our numerical results concern basically the behavior of the @xmath49 which is also the average energy @xmath50 .",
    "two steps were applied in order to obtain @xmath49 .",
    "firstly , we evaluate @xmath49 over the orbit for a single initial condition @xmath51 where the index @xmath52 corresponds to a sample of an ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "hence @xmath49 is written as @xmath53 we have iterated eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) up to @xmath54 for an ensemble of @xmath55 different initial conditions .",
    "the variable @xmath56 is fixed at @xmath57 , @xmath58 is uniformly distributed on @xmath59 $ ] and the control parameter was fixed as @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the behavior of the @xmath49 as a function of @xmath33 for five different values of the dissipation parameter @xmath10 , as labelled in the figure .",
    "it is easy to see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) two different kinds of behavior . for short @xmath33 , @xmath61 grows according to a power law and suddenly it bends towards a regime of saturation for large enough values of @xmath33 .",
    "the crossover from growth to the saturation is marked by a crossover iteration number @xmath34 .",
    "this crossover number @xmath34 is actually quite well defined by the crossing of the two straight lines : the acceleration line and the saturation line in the log - log plot .",
    "based on the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) , the following scaling hypotheses are assumed :    1 .    when @xmath62 , @xmath61 grows according to @xmath63 where the exponent @xmath64 is the acceleration exponent ; 2 .",
    "when @xmath65 , @xmath61 approaches a regime of saturation , which is described by @xmath66 where the exponent @xmath67 is the saturation exponent ; 3 .",
    "the crossover iteration number @xmath34 that marks the change from growth to the saturation is written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the crossover exponent .",
    "after considering these three initial suppositions , @xmath61 can be described in terms of a scaling function of the type @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the scaling factor , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are scaling exponents that in principle must be related to @xmath67 , @xmath64 and @xmath69 . since @xmath71 is a scaling factor we can choose @xmath74 , or @xmath75 .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath76 where the function @xmath77 is assumed to be constant for @xmath62 .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) , allows one to conclude that @xmath78 .",
    "choosing now @xmath79 and eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "it is also assumed as constant for @xmath65 .",
    "comparison of eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) gives us @xmath82 .",
    "given the two different expressions of the scaling factor @xmath71 in the crossover region @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 and one must conclude that the crossover exponent @xmath69 is given by @xmath85 . observe that the scaling exponents are determined if the critical exponents @xmath64 and @xmath67 were numerically obtained .",
    "the exponent @xmath64 is obtained from a power law fitting for @xmath61 curves for the parameter @xmath86 $ ] for short iteration number , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the average of these values give us @xmath88 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the behavior of ( a ) @xmath89 and ( b ) @xmath90 .",
    "applying power law fitting in the figure , it was found that @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "given @xmath67 and @xmath64 the crossover exponent can also be obtained by solving @xmath85 , yielding @xmath93 .",
    "such result indeed agrees with our numerical result .",
    "finally , with the values of the critical exponents , the scaling hypothesis can be verified .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) shows the collapse onto a single universal plot of five different curves of the @xmath49 for different values of the dissipation parameter .",
    "we have also considered the behavior of the average standard deviation of @xmath18 , which is defined as @xmath94 we have considered an ensemble of @xmath55 different initial conditions iterated up to @xmath95 .",
    "the variable @xmath56 has been fixed as @xmath57 and @xmath58 were uniformly distributed along @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) shows the behavior of the @xmath96 as a function of the number of collisions @xmath33 for different values of the dissipation parameter and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) their collapse onto an universal plot .",
    "the acceleration exponent is @xmath97 .",
    "in such a case @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 as can be seen in fig . [ fig5 ] . a similar scaling analysis shows a relationship @xmath102 , well in agreement with the numerical result for @xmath103 .",
    "this set of critical exponents is the same as observed in a dissipative bouncer model @xcite where a classical particle collides inelastically with a time periodically moving wall under the effect of gravity .",
    "it also is the same set as observed for the oval - like billiard moving under the effect of a quadratic frictional force @xcite .",
    "although both , the systems and the kind of dissipation , are different , the phase transition they are experiencing , namely , suppressing the unlimited growth of the dynamical observable ( energy for the oval - like billiard , deviation of the average velocity for the dissipative bouncer and deviation of the average action on the standard ) , belongs to the same class of universality .     as a function of @xmath104 for @xmath105",
    "]    the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) and fig [ fig4 ] ( b ) together with the scaling discussion leads to an universal plot .",

    "( i ) oval billiard @xcite ; ( ii ) lorentz gas @xcite and ; ( iii ) elliptical billiard @xcite . for these cases , the transformation @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 or @xmath108 ) and @xmath109 all the curves for all these systems collapse onto a single universal plot as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( for @xmath110 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( for @xmath111 ) . based on this , we propose the following empirical function    @xmath112    where the only parameter that remains is the acceleration exponent @xmath64 .",

    "as the concluding remark , some results for a dissipative standard map have been addressed . for the regime of strong dissipation , the model exhibits a period doubling bifurcation cascade , where the so called feigenbaum s @xmath42 was numerically obtained . when weak dissipation is taken into account , for small values of @xmath0 , the mixed structure of the phase space",
    "is changed , the elliptic fixed points are replaced by attracting fixed points .",
    "no large chaotic attractors are observed in such a regime . for large @xmath0 ,",
