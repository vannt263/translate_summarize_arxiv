    "stoichiometric ( pure ) euo is a ferromagnetic semiconductor . in the sixties and seventies it became famous for the redshift of its optical absorption edge below the curie temperature @xmath0 ( 69 k ) @xcite .",
    "eu - rich euo , whose eu richness is realized by oxygen vacancies , behaves like a metal at low temperatures and shows a tremendous metal - insulator transition near the curie temperature @xcite .",
    "a jump in resistivity of 13 orders of magnitude was measured by penney et al .",
    "@xcite but , since leakage currents limited the measurement , it was probably even greater .",
    "it is a remarkable feature that the size of the jump in resistivity varies greatly amongst different experimental samples @xcite .",
    "another intriguing feature is a low - temperature resistance minimum in high - resistivity samples .",
    "furthermore , eu - rich euo has a huge colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) @xcite .",
    "recently interest in euo was renewed by measurements of the resistance and of the spin - split conduction band of a euo film by steeneken et al .",
    "the authors emphasize the extraordinary properties of eu - rich euo and their importance for basic research in the field of spintronics due to the almost perfect spin polarization of the conduction electrons at low temperatures .",
    "the first physical picture ( he model ) for the metal - insulator transition in eu - rich euo was developed by oliver et al .",
    "they postulated a temperature - independent electronic trap ( impurity ) level created by the oxygen vacancies .",
    "it is below the conduction band for high temperatures , where eu - rich euo is an insulator .",
    "on decreasing the temperature below @xmath0 , the spin - up conduction band is shifted towards lower energies ( redshift ) and therefore crosses the impurity level at some point .",
    "the electrons of the trap level are emptied into the conduction band giving rise to euo becoming a metal .",
    "later the model was refined by introducing a coulomb repulsion between the two electrons at an oxygen vacancy and ascribing a temperature - dependent shift to the trap levels @xcite .",
    "however , the shift of the impurity levels is unphysical as will be explained below .",
    "there is a second physical picture ( the bound magnetic polaron ( bmp ) ) , which was introduced by torrance et al .",
    "@xcite . they assumed an exchange interaction of the surplus electrons of each vacancy site with the eu spins .",
    "theoretical attempts to quantify the metal - insulator transition of eu - rich euo were made by laks et al .",
    "@xcite , mauger @xcite and steeneken @xcite .",
    "the conductivity in all three cases was obtained by the simple drude formula @xmath1 ( @xmath2- conduction - electron density , @xmath3-elementary charge , @xmath4-mobility ) .    in this paper",
    "we formulate an extended kondo - lattice hamiltonian as a microscopic model for the metal - insulator transition in eu - rich euo .",
    "it contains qualitatively the idea of the he model through the assumption of impurity trap levels , and it contains the physics of the bmp since an exchange between the impurity - electron spins and the eu spins is included .",
    "however , our formulation goes beyond the former two approaches because of the detailed modelling of the impurity orbital energies and their hybridization with the conduction band .",
    "the disorder of the oxygen vacancies is treated within an extension of the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "our calculations should be more accurate than the ones in refs .   since we are using a more complex conductivity formula @xcite , which is derived directly from the fundamental current - current correlation kubo formula .",
    "in order to model the situation in eu - rich euo , first one has to consider a conduction band @xmath5 .",
    "the spins of the conduction electrons @xmath6 are coupled to the eu spins @xmath7 via a coupling constant @xmath8 . these terms represent the kondo lattice model .",
    "then , there are impurity levels @xmath9 , a coulomb repulsion @xmath10 in case of two electrons at an oxygen vacancy , and an exchange between the impurity - electron spins @xmath11 and the eu spins with coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , there should be a hybridization @xmath13 between impurity electrons ( @xmath14 ) and conduction electrons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the superexchange between the eu spins is not modeled explicitly .",
    "instead we are considering @xmath16 as a parameter , whose temperature dependence is given by a brillouin function , which is fulfilled to very high accuracy in eu - rich euo @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian which captures all the features discussed is the following : @xmath17 the sums over @xmath18 and @xmath19 mean a sum over all lattice sites and a sum over the randomly distributed oxygen - vacancy ( impurity ) sites , respectively . as the actual value of @xmath12 is not known , @xmath20 is assumed for simplicity .",
    "the current operator is given by @xmath21\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the density operator @xcite @xmath22 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ham])-([eq : dens_op ] ) yield a surprisingly simple result for the current operator in a cubic system : @xmath23 eq .",
    "( [ eq : curr_op ] ) has to be put into the current - current correlation kubo formula for the conductivity @xcite .",
    "if the self - energy is local , which is exact in infinite dimensions , e.g.  if applying dynamical - mean field theory ( dmft ) , there is a substantial simplification to the kubo formula .",
    "all vertex corrections to the current - current correlation function vanish and one is left with an expression that only contains the one - particle spectral density @xcite .",
    "we apply the local approximation to the self - energy and use the same conductivity formula for the three - dimensional case : @xmath24 where @xmath13 is the volume , @xmath25 is the derivative of the fermi function and @xmath26 is the spectral density of the conduction electrons .",

    "( [ eq : self - energy_c ] ) and ( [ eq : self - energy_p ] ) are so far exact relations .",
    "the main approximation of our approach consists in making independent ansatzes for the conduction - electron and impurity selfenergies .",
    "this is justified if the effect of the hybridization , which to the lowest order is proportional to @xmath33 , is small . in our calculations",
    "it turns out that the hybridization @xmath13 itself has to be small to give a reasonable order of magnitude of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to neglect in the selfenergies effects of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "the conduction - electron self - energy is taken from an interpolating ansatz @xcite for the conduction electron part of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 & a_\\sigma = s(s+1)-z_\\sigma \\langle s^z \\rangle ( z_\\sigma \\langle s^z \\rangle + 1)\\;,\\;\\ ; b_\\sigma=\\frac{1}{2 } j \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the free conduction electron green s function .",
    "the ansatz ( [ eq : cond_el_self - energy ] ) fulfills all known limiting cases for @xmath38 ( ferromagnetic saturation , atomic limit , second - order perturbation theory in @xmath8 and high - energy - expansion up to the fourth moment ) .",
    "it is therefore especially appropriate in the present case of very small conduction - electron densities ( @xmath39 - @xmath40 per unit cell ) .    for the impurity self - energy @xmath41",
    "we take the self - energy of the atomic limit of the correlated kondo - lattice model @xcite ( impurity part of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) ) ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "if @xmath10 is large enough in comparison with @xmath8 , this leads to a 4-peak structure in the impurity quasiparticle density of states with the highest peak at @xmath43 .",
    "the peak positions are fixed , i.e.  do not depend on the magnetization @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the above - mentioned picture by oliver et al .",
    "@xcite , which asigns a temperature - dependent shift to the impurity levels , is wrong .",
    "however , the weights of the peaks depend on @xmath44 as well as on the impurity occupation . for any parameters",
    "only 3 peaks have a finite weight .",
    "the peak at @xmath45 will act as the impurity level which donates electrons to the conduction band .",
    "we have made ansatzes for the selfenergies @xmath41 and @xmath46 which are correct for all known limiting cases of @xmath38 and up to the first order in the hybridization @xmath13 .    to treat the randomness of the oxygen vacancies we use the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) , which originally was invented to deal with a non - interacting alloy @xcite .",
    "here we are dealing with strongly interacting electrons in a two - component alloy .",
    "one component corresponds to the impurity sites @xmath47 , the other to the non - impurity sites @xmath48 .",
    "first , because of our effective medium approach and the locality of the impurity self - energy , local effective one - particle energies for the impurity sites are retained .",
    "the second problem is how to treat the non - impurity sites in a consistent way . to solve this , for non - impurity sites we also introduce one - particle levels @xmath49 and hybridization terms with the conduction band @xmath50 .",
    "the one - particle energies @xmath51 must diverge to infinity at non - impurity sites to assure that these levels are never really occupied . with these virtual levels and a non - random hybridization on the lattice the usual cpa equation can be formulated : @xmath52 @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 the concentrations of impurity and non - impurity sites , respectively .",
    "@xmath56 is the local impurity green s function and @xmath57 the cpa self - energy .",

    "[ eq : green ] the spectral density @xmath26 can be obtained . since @xmath60 enters the conductivity formula ( [ eq : sigma_dmft ] ) ,",

    "the width of the conduction band @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) can be taken from the absorption spectrum of ref .   or from band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a semielliptical shape of the conduction band , which approximates well the actual situation at the lower band edge @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 determines the shift of the conduction band ( @xmath63 ) , which is about 0.3 ev ( half band - splitting ) at low temperatures @xcite . for eu spins of @xmath64",
    "this implies a coupling constant @xmath65 .",
    "the position of @xmath45 is in general not known . only for the highest - resistivity curves an activation energy of 0.3 ev",
    "was observed @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 is assumed to be fixed at 1ev , the impurity energy @xmath9 remains the parameter to be adjusted .",
    "the hybridization @xmath13 , which is also not known , should not be too large in order not to destroy the effect of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we have chosen @xmath66 .",
    "of all parameters , @xmath61 and @xmath8 are taken from the experiment .",
    "the precise values of @xmath10 and @xmath13 are not important apart from the fact that the hybridization should be small .",
    "the decisive free parameter is the impurity level @xmath45 since it determines the position of the chemical potential . for the vacancy ( impurity ) concentration @xmath58 medium values are of the order of 0.1% @xcite .",

    "note the different orders of magnitude ( 7 , 6 and 5 ) of the jump in resistivity of the three experimental samples , which together with the absolute values of the resistivity are reproduced fairly well by the calculated curves .",
    "this demonstrates that the variation in the resistivity behaviour can be explained by different impurity concentrations .",

    "a _ qualitative _ explanation of the metal - insulator transition is possible in terms of quasiparticle densities of states along the lines of the he model ( with the difference that there are three instead of one impurity level , so the number of electrons which can be emptied into the conduction band is not so big ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdosi_2 ] for low temperatures the uppermost impurity level @xmath45 lies within the spin - up part of the conduction band , which is down - shifted due to the exchange with the eu spins .",

    "the high values of the resistivity indicate that the impurity peak at @xmath45 must be rather distant from the conduction band at @xmath0 . on lowering the temperature , the resistivity first decreases since the spin - up conduction band moves down towards the impurity level @xmath45 .",

    "in summary , a model has been presented which , in connection with a conductivity formula that is derived from the fundamental kubo formula in the local - self - energy approximation , allows to accurately reproduce the spectacular metal - insulator transition and the huge cmr in eu - rich euo .",
