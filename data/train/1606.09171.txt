    "mathisson @xcite and papapetrou @xcite provided the equations of motion for a spinning particle in a curved spacetime .",
    "the equations of motion of a spinning test particle are interesting from the astrophysical point of view , because they approximate the motion of a stellar compact object in the spacetime background of a supermassive black hole .",
    "such a binary system is called an extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) .",
    "emris are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves expected to be detected by space interferometer antennas like lisa ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , in this work we focus rather on the dynamics of a spinning particle system than on astrophysical aspects .",
    "the number of mathisson - papapetrou ( mp ) equations is smaller than the number of variables which the mp equations intend to evolve .",
    "the above fact can be interpreted as a freedom of choosing different worldlines for evolving the equation of motion of the same extended object described by the pole - dipole approximation @xcite . to choose a worldline we use a supplementary condition that is known in the literature as the spin supplementary condition ( ssc ) .",
    "there is a variety of sscs ( for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but all are physically acceptable .",
    "the most renown are the pirani ( p ) @xcite and the tulczyjew ( t ) @xcite sscs .",
    "for many years the p ssc was considered unphysical , because the test particle exhibited helical motion in the flat spacetime limit . however , in @xcite it has been shown that this helical motion results from a hidden momentum and the p ssc is physically valid as well .",
    "the aspect of the spinning particle dynamics we are interested in is the issue of the integrability of the corresponding system .",
    "it has been shown that for the schwarzschild background the mp equations with t ssc give chaotic orbits @xcite , and the same holds for the kerr background , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "hence , one can claim that the mp equations with t ssc correspond to a non - integrable system .",
    "however , in the linear in spin approximation of the mp equations , it has been proved that for the t ssc a killing - yano tensor provides a carter - like constant of motion for the kerr background @xcite .",
    "the existence of a carter - like constant and the fact that the t and p sscs are the same in the linear regime led to the impression that in the linear in spin approximation the spinning particle dynamics corresponds to an integrable system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for geodesic orbits in a kerr spacetime the existence of the carter constant ensures integrability , since it is the fourth constant of motion ( the others being the energy , the angular momentum along the symmetry axis and the contraction of the four - momentum ) in a hamiltonian system of four degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , when the particle is spinning we have extra degrees of freedom , and it is questionable even if the existence of a carter - like constant can ensure the integrability of the system .    when examining whether a system is integrable or not , it is useful to have a canonical hamiltonian formalism which provides symplecticity . in a non - symplectic system",
    "we need as many constants of motion as the dimensionality of the phase space .",
    "on the other hand , in a canonical hamiltonian system two dimensions of the phase space correspond to one degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , we need half the number of constants of motion in order to have integrability with respect to a non - canonical system of the same phase space dimensionality . moreover , by having a canonical hamiltonian system , tools like poincar sections can be properly used .",
    "when a system is not symplectic , then a surface of section is ambiguous .",
    "a canonical hamiltonian formalism has not been found yet for the mp equations with the t ssc .",
    "however , such canonical hamiltonian formalism has been provided in @xcite for the newton - wigner ( nw ) ssc @xcite in the linearized in spin approximation .",
    "a hamiltonian for a spinning particle moving in a kerr spacetime background has been first provided in @xcite . however , due to the approximative procedure which leads from the mp equations to the linearized in spin hamiltonian function , the resulting hamiltonian equations are not equivalent to the corresponding mp equations , e.g. , starting the hamiltonian equations and the mp equations with the same initial conditions lead to two diferrent orbits @xcite .",
    "it might even occur that the final linearized hamiltonian system may not even respect some symmetries that the corresponding mp equations respect .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian function provided in @xcite for the kerr spacetime in boyer - lindquist coordinates did not respect in the schwarzschild limit @xmath3 the spherical background symmetry .",
    "namely , the total angular momentum was not preserved as it should be .",
    "absence of integrals of motions could lead to the misleading impression that for the schwarzschild background the hamiltonian corresponds to a non - integrable system ( see , e.g. , figure  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with the hamiltonian in @xcite was the specific tetrad field choice on which the hamiltonian function was built on .",
    "even in @xcite , it was found that the resulting hamiltonian would evolve the spin in the flat spacetime limit @xcite .",
    "however , since the helical motion in the case of the mp equations with p ssc could result from a hidden momentum , the same could hold for the hamiltonian approximation coming from the nw ssc .",
    "thus , a more solid reasoning was needed to show the drawbacks of the tetrad field chosen in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that if the resulting hamiltonian should respect the symmetries of the schwarzschild background , then the corresponding tetrad filed should obey a certain prescription ( equation  ( 44 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the tetrad field of @xcite is not complying with this prescription .    on the other hand",
    ", a different tetrad field choise provided in @xcite led to a revised hamiltonian for the kerr background .",
    "this tetrad field is obeying the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the schwarzschild limit the revised hamiltonian @xcite was conserving not only the total angular momentum as it should be , but it was shown in @xcite that the magnitude of the orbital momentum was preserved as well .",
    "the latter implies that in the schwarzschild limit the revised hamiltonian of @xcite corresponds to an integrable system , since for a five degrees of freedom system we have five constants of motion @xcite .",
    "the revised hamiltonian ceases to be integrable when the spin of the central black hole is nonzero @xcite , i.e. , in the kerr spacetime background .",
    "a thorough study of the non - integrability of the revised hamiltonian is the subject of our article .",
    "the study of chaotic motion around black holes probably starts with @xcite , where a method based on cantor sets was applied to prove the chaotic nature of the system . since then many methods have been applied to detect chaos in the vicinity of black holes , but the most common is the 2d poincar section .",
    "it is a fact that in order to study the non - integrability of a two degrees of freedom hamiltonian system a 2d poincar section is a standard tool .",
    "however , since the hamiltonian provided in @xcite corresponds to a system with three degrees of freedom , we have to deal with 4d poincar sections @xcite . in order to detect order and chaos in the 4d poincar spaces of section",
    ", we must first of all have a way to visualize them . in the past",
    ", several methods have been proposed for the visualization of the 4d surfaces of section in a 6d phase space of a 3d autonomus hamiltonian system : ordinary 2d projections @xcite , 3d projections @xcite , stereoscopic projections @xcite , or 2d slices of 3d subspaces ( @xcite , and recently a more sophisticated version in @xcite ( see appendix ) .    in the present work we use the method of color and rotation , introduced by patsis and zachilas @xcite .",
    "this method is extensively described for the case of 3d rotating galactic potentials in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "these papers investigate portraits of the 4d spaces of section in the neighborhood of periodic orbits exhibiting all kinds of instabilities encountered in 3d hamiltonian systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the method has also been applied in the study of the structure of the phase space close to fixed points in a 4d symplectic map @xcite , and to design spacecraft orbits @xcite .",
    "the method consists in plotting the points ( the consequents ) of an orbit in a 3d subspace as they cross the space of section in a given direction , rotate them by means of standard 3d graphic tools to get a good insight of their distribution in the 3d subspace , and finally color them according to their value in the fourth dimension ( the one not used in the 3d spatial representation of the orbit ) .",
    "color allows the estimation of the smoothness in the 4th dimension of geometrical structures appearing in the 3d projections and the distinction of pseudo- from true intersections in the 4d space .",
    "thus , one can establish criteria for the regular , weak chaotic or strong chaotic character of a given orbit @xcite . in the latter papers , specific patterns in phase space",
    "are associated with the various kinds of instability or with stability . in our paper",
    "this method is used in the study of the dynamics of a spinning particle in the hamiltonian approach in an effort to trace regular and chaotic motion in the phase space of our system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "greek letters denote the indices corresponding to spacetime ( running from 0 to 3 ) , while latin letters denote indices corresponding only to space ( running from 1 to 3 ) .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian formalism of a spinning particle in @xcite has been achieved by linearizing the mp equations of motion for the nw ssc . in this formalism",
    "the mass of the test particle @xmath0 is considered a constant of motion @xcite , and the spin of the particle is given by a three vector @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian function @xmath6 splits in two main parts , the non - spinning @xmath7 , which describes basically the geodesic motion , and the spinning part @xmath8 , which incorporates the spinning of the particle , i.e. , @xmath9    the non - spinning part of the hamiltonian @xmath7 reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the canonical momenta conjugate to the coordinates @xmath12 of the hamiltonian   @xcite , and @xmath13 @xmath14 is the contravariant form of the metric tensor of the background spacetime in which the test particle moves .",

    "the equations of motion for the canonical variables as a function of the coordinate time @xmath16 read @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian approximation provided in @xcite has five degrees of freedom .",
    "three degrees of freedom come from the coordinates , and two degrees from the spin vector @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that for the schwarzschild spacetime background the hamiltonian approximation possesses five integrals of motion .",
    "the spherically symmetric background corresponds to the preservation of the total angular momentum , thus , two independent and in involution integrals come from the spherical symmetry ; since the hamiltonian is autonomous , the hamiltonian function is a constant of motion , representing the energy ; the measure of the particle s spin is conserved , and the measure of the orbital angular momentum is a constant as well .",
    "hence , since we have five independent and in involution integrals for five degrees of freedom , the hamiltonian of a spinning particle for a schwarzschild background is integrable @xcite .    for nonzero spin of the central black hole , however , chaotic motion appears ( see figure  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this means that for the kerr background the revised hamiltonian of @xcite is non - integrable . actually , figure  3 of @xcite is a projection of a 4d poincar map on a 2d surface of section .",
    "the 2d projections of a 4d poincar map is an old technique to visualize the dynamics of a chaotic system ( method [ item:2dpr ] in appendix  [ sec : v4d ] ) .",
    "similar techniques have been employed in previous studies @xcite when the question of chaos was examined for spinning particles using mp equations . however , since the mp equations are not symplectic , the use of surface of sections for studying their dynamics is ambiguous . on the other hand , the canonical hamiltonian formalism of @xcite is symplectic ( see , e.g. , appendix a in @xcite ) , and , hence , the subsequent study of poincar sections stands on solid ground from this point of view .      to evolve the hamiltonian equation of motion we need to set up the initial conditions of our system .",
    "we have nine variables , i.e. , three variables for the position , three for the momentum , and three for the spin . in the case of the kerr background",
    "we have two integrals of motion apart from the hamiltonian function @xmath6 .",
    "namely , the azimuthal component of the total angular momentum @xcite @xmath31 and the measure of the particle s spin @xcite @xmath32 are preserved . for a group of orbits to belong to the same surface of section they have to share the same values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we are going to use the above three constants to fix the initial conditions .    since the kerr background is axisymmetric , the initial value of the azimuthal angle @xmath17 can be set to @xmath35 without loss of generality .",
    "the equatorial plane @xmath36 seems to define the appropriate surface of section , due to reflection symmetry along the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetime .",
    "the equatorial plane was also chosen as the surface of section by previous studies of the spinning particle dynamics @xcite .",
    "on the equatorial plane we choose initial conditions along the radial direction @xmath19 and for each orbit we set the initial radial momentum to @xmath37 .",
    "the spin components @xmath38 are chosen to be set to @xmath35 , and , thus , the measure of the component @xmath39 is defined by the spin s magnitude .",
    "the sign of @xmath39 shows if the particle s spin is initially aligned with the spin of the central object ( positive sign ) or anti - aligned ( negative sign ) . from , with given @xmath39",
    ", we can get @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is found through a newton iteration for a given value of the hamiltonian function @xmath6 . alone which drastically reduces the complexity of the newton iteration .",
    "] obviously the above initial condition setting is not unique , but we found it convenient for our investigation .",
    "the equations of motion   are evolved by a gauss runge ",
    "kutta integration scheme which has very good conservation properties for symplectic systems ( see , e.g. ,  appendix a in  @xcite ) . on the surface of section",
    "we record crossings with @xmath42 . in order to calculate the phase space points on the sections very precisely , we take use of the integration scheme s interpolation property as described in appendix a of  @xcite .    in our visualization",
    "we are going to use only the variables @xmath43 , since by using the constants of motion  - we can reduce our phase space to the positions , and the momenta .",
    "above we have chosen @xmath36 for our surface of section due to the reflection symmetry . moreover , even if @xmath17 evolves in time , we do not to use it for the @xmath44 poincar sections , because the kerr spacetime is axially symmetric and , therefore , the variable @xmath17 should not carry any useful information .",
    "thus , in our 4d  poincar sections we are using @xmath45 for the 3d projection , while @xmath40 is represented by the color . however , note that due to the constant  @xmath33  , the use of @xmath40 to color the consequents is equivalent to the use of @xmath39 , i.e. , the maxima of the one quantity correspond to the minima of the other one .",
    "the spin is measured in @xmath46 units , namely @xmath47 is dimensionless . by setting @xmath48",
    "the spin is dimensionless , and all the other quantities as well . in some of our numerical examples",
    "we are using unrealistic high values for the particle s spin measure , e.g. @xmath49 .",
    "however , these values are dynamically valid even for the linearized in spin hamiltonian formulation we are using , because once the hamiltonian function is explicitly written the hamiltonian system is selfconsistent .",
    "namely , the hamiltonian function itself depends just linearly on the spin components , and the hamiltonian equations   are just linearly depended on the spin as well .",
    "the only limitation is the astrophysical .",
    "the dimensionless spin value becomes astrophysically relevant for emri when @xmath50 ( for more details see section ii.b in @xcite ) .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the aim of this work is basically a dynamical investigation of the system , not an astrophysical one .",
    "as far as the kerr parameter is concerned , we have chosen the value @xmath51 in our study .",
    "the reason is the following . in order to have integrability",
    "we can go either to the geodesic limit @xmath52 , or to the schwarzschild limit @xmath53 .",
    "thus , in order to have the most pronounced non - integrability effects , we have to go away from both above limits , which is the case with @xmath51 .",
    "this does not mean that for smaller kerr parameters we can not find signs of chaos .",
    "actually , the non - integrability of the linear in spin hamiltonian approximation for the kerr background was found for @xmath54 ( figure  3 in @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig:2ds1 ] shows a two dimensional projection of a poincar section . we can observe a chaotic region ( scattered points ) encircling an island of stability",
    "the chaotic sea is confined between two surfaces .",
    "the inner one , which defines the limit of the island of stability , is a kam torus , while the outer one is the boundary of the allowed motion .",
    "the outer boundary is indicated by the outer limit of the chaotic orbit .",
    "the boundary of the allowed motion has an opening around @xmath58 from which the chaotic orbits are plunging towards the central black hole @xmath59 .",

    "we encountered three types of orbits in our study , which , though studied in detail in a 3d galactic system @xcite , have never been investigated in other 3d systems in the framework of general relativity .",

    "they are represented by 4d filamentary structures on the 4d poincar sections as in @xcite .",
    "these structures are in the neighborhood of unstable periodic orbits with high multiplicity .",
    "such orbits are sticky chaotic orbits since their consequents leave the 4d filamentary structures after a longer time of integration .",
    "in general we did not encounter strong chaos in the system , which would be manifested by color mixing on the 4d poincar sections .",
    "we encountered only weakly chaotic and sticky orbits .",
    "moreover , we observe that chaotic motion seems to be insignificant , and its contribution to the overall dynamics can be probably be neglected , when the dimensionless spin becomes smaller than @xmath80 , i.e. when the value of the spin is in the astrophysical relevant interval for extreme mass ratio inspirals . however , from a dynamical point of view the inclusion of the particle s spin in the motion of a small compact object is just one way to go from the integrable case of geodesic motion on a kerr black hole background to a non - integrable system .",
    "for example , it is well known that rings and halos around black holes can induce chaotic motion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the same effect takes place when the spacetime around the central supermassive object is described by a non - kerr black hole ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "non - integrability can also originate from the self - force or from the inclusion of the quadrupole momentum to the mathisson - papapetrou equations . in few words , there are many reasons for a extreme mass ratio binary to be described by a non - integrable system .",

    "however , in many cases , thin structures resembling invariant curves in the 2d case indicate the presence of tori .",
    "* stereoscopic views * : stereoscopic views of a 3d subspace of the 4d poincar space of section are used in order to understand the topology of the 3d projections @xcite of the figures . for this reason ,",
    "two figures are needed , one for each eye of the observer . however",
    ", this method can not give any information about the behavior of the orbit in the 4th dimension .",
    "* the method of slices * : in this method @xcite 2d slices for different values of the third dimension of a 4d poincar space of section are produced .",
    "the successive 2d figures help one to see the distribution of the points of an orbit in the 3d subspace of the 4d space of section . by using this method",
    "many figures are needed in order to understand the third dimension and the fourth dimension in the 4d space of section is absolutely lost .",
    "an improved version of this method has been demonstrated recently in @xcite . in this case 3d",
    "are used , instead of 2d , slices of the space of section and they can be rotated by using standard 3d graphics software . by doing so , one can better see the third dimension and `` visualize '' the fourth dimension of the 4d poincar space of section as well .",
    "the disadvantage of this version of the slices method is that the 3d slices can be very complicated and sometimes it is difficult to see directly the topology of the orbits in the 4d poincar space of section .",
    "the method of color and rotation * : this method was introduced in @xcite and is applied in the present paper ( see also our introduction ) .",
    "the method has the advantage that we can observe the 4d distribution of the points of an orbit without any change of the 3d geometry or the 3d topology of the orbit in the 4d poincar space of section .",
