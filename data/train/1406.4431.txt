    "singular integral equations have played a significant role in the study of crack propagation in elastic media since their introduction by @xcite and have garnered much scientific attention @xcite .",
    "they have been used in the analysis of crack problems in complex domains containing an arbitrary number of wedges and layers separated by imperfect interfaces @xcite ; the resulting singular integral equations with fixed point singularities have been analysed by @xcite , based on the theory of linear singular operators @xcite .",
    "more recently , singular integral equations have been applied to problems involving interfacial cracks in both isotropic @xcite and anisotropic bimaterials @xcite .",
    "this paper extends the singular integral equation approach to an anisotropic bimaterial containing an imperfect interface .",
    "interfacial problems concerning a semi - infinite crack along a perfect interface in an anisotropic bimaterial have been considered in @xcite through the use of the formalisms proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "expressions were found for the stress intensity factors at the crack tip under the restriction of symmetric loading on the crack faces . using weight function techniques introduced by @xcite and developed further by @xcite",
    ", an approach was developed to find stress intensity factors for an interfacial crack along a perfect interface under asymmetric loading for both the static and dynamic cases , see @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "more widely , weight functions are well developed in the literature for a wide range of fractured body geometries and allow for the evaluation of important constants that may act as fracture criteria .",
    "for instance , weight functions have been obtained for a corner crack in a plate of finite thickness @xcite , a 3d semi - infinite crack in an infinite body @xcite and a crack lying perpendicular to the interface in a thin surface layer @xcite .",
    "imperfect interfaces provide a more physically realistic interpretation of a bimaterial than a perfect one , accounting for the fact that the interface between two materials is rarely sharp .",
    "@xcite took this into account by suggesting the interface be replaced with a thin strip of finite thickness , which provided the bonding material occupying the strip is sufficiently soft may be replaced by so - called imperfect interface transmission conditions .",
    "these allow for an interfacial displacement jump in direct proportion to the traction , which is itself continuous across the interface @xcite .",
    "such transmission conditions alter physical fields near the crack tip significantly ; for instance the usual perfect interface square root stress singularity is no longer present and is instead replaced by a logarithmic singularity @xcite , although tractions remain bounded along the interface .",
    "more general imperfect interface transmission conditions were derived by @xcite which considered a thin curved isotropic layer of constant thickness , while @xcite presented a general interface model for a 3d arbitrarily curved thin anisotropic interphase between two anisotropic solids .",
    "weight function techniques have adapted to imperfect interface settings to quantify crack tip asymptotics in thin domains @xcite , analyse problems of waves in thin waveguides @xcite and conduct perturbation analysis for large imperfectly bound bimaterials containing small defects ; the absence of the square root singularity means that the weight functions are not used to find stress intensity factors , but instead yield asymptotic constants which describe the crack tip opening displacement .",
    "this quantity was proposed for use in fracture criteria by @xcite and @xcite and later justified rigorously by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . despite their great utility ,",
    "the derivation of such weight functions is often not straightforward and so the approach deployed in the remainder of this paper efficiently utilises existing relationships between known weight functions without the need to derive further expressions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 2 introduces the problem geometry and model for the imperfect interface . in section 3 , previously found results used in the derivation of the singular integral equations are discussed .",
    "these include the weight functions derived using the method of @xcite and the betti formula which can be used to relate the weight functions to the physical fields along both the crack and imperfect interface .",
    "section 4 concentrates on solving the out - of - plane ( mode iii ) problem .",
    "singular integral equations are derived and used to obtain the displacement jump across both the crack and interface for a number of orthotropic bimaterials with varying levels of interface imperfection .",
    "finite element methods for the same physical problems are also used to obtain the same results and then a comparison is made between the results obtained from the two opposing methods .",
    "the in - plane problem is considered in section 5 , where singular integral equations are obtained for the mode i and mode ii tractions and displacements and some computations are performed .",
    "we consider an infinite anisotropic bimaterial with an imperfect interface and a semi - infinite interfacial crack respectively lying along the positive and negative @xmath0 semi - axes .",

    "applying fourier transforms then gives @xmath46    note that the exact nature of the weight functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 used in this analysis have not been specified at this stage and so identity ( [ finalbetti ] ) is valid for a large class of weight functions . in particular , this allows for the use of perfect interface weight functions for the imperfect interface physical setting . in the case of perfect interface physical solution and weight functions ,",
    "the corresponding analysis has been done in @xcite , for isotropic and anisotropic materials respectively , while for imperfect interfaces joining isotropic bodies , details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now seek boundary integral equations relating the mode iii interfacial traction and displacement jump over the crack in the anisotropic bimaterial .",
