    "with the accumulation of high - quality cosmological data from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations , anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and measurements of the large - scale properties of the universe ( lss ) , the need for an acceleration mechanism governing the late - time cosmic evolution has been confirmed @xcite . from the observational viewpoint , the standard @xmath2cdm model ,",
    "whose cosmic dynamics is driven by a cosmological constant @xmath2 and a component of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , remains as the most consistent cosmological setting .",
    "however , despite its observational successes , the standard model suffers from fundamental theoretical issues ( see , e.g.@xcite ) , which motivate the investigation of various alternative scenarios such as quintessence @xcite , modified gravity theories @xcite , decaying vacuum models @xcite , among others ( see  @xcite and refereces therein ) .",
    "the implementation of observational tests that are able to distinguish between such scenarios and the standard one has become one of the most important tasks nowadays in cosmology since they not only test the observational viability of these alternative models but also discuss the standard cosmology in a more general perspective .",
    "however , many of these models behave very similarly to the standard @xmath2cdm paradigm at the level of background evolution , making it difficult to distinguish them through observational data such as sne ia measurements .",
    "this forces us to go beyond the background expansion , i.e. , towards perturbations and the non - linear regime of structure formation . in this",
    "regard , observation of cluster number counts as function of the cluster mass and redshift have been accounted as a potential candidate for probing both the expansion rate and the growth of perturbations , thereby providing independent constraints on cosmological parameters , such as the present - day matter density parameter @xmath3 and the rms density fluctuation @xmath4 .",
    "this kind of data can , therefore , provide a new window for cosmological modelling , with the ability of distinguishing between the various dark energy models or among the various alternative scenarios by their effects on structure formation .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there are a number of surveys , either on going or being planned for the near future , that are expected to release a large number of cluster counts data .",
    "this certainly will improve the complementarity of cluster observations with other cosmological probes , such as cmb , sne ia and lss observations .",
    "in this paper we study the non - linear evolution of density perturbations in a spatially flat cosmological model in which vacuum decays linearly with the hubble parameter , leading to the production of cold dark matter at a constant rate @xcite .",
    "this is a particular case of models with interaction in the dark sector @xcite that has been shown competitive , with good concordance in both background and linear perturbation levels @xcite .",
    "further , we analyze how such an interacting process affects the predicted halo abundance . for this purpose",
    "we calculate all relevant expressions for the mass function and the cluster number density following the sheth - torman formalism @xcite and compare our results with that of the standard @xmath2cdm scenario .",
    "we also test the robustness of our results by considering a mass function different from the one introduced by sheth - torman .",
