    "to model the phase behaviour of polymer gelation requires the consideration of systems of multiple polymers @xcite .",
    "the study of two polymers with interpolymer interactions and interacting with a surface has received much recent attention because of connections to modelling the unzipping of dna .",
    "typically these have been modelled via either self - avoiding or directed walk systems on lattices in two and three dimensions with various types of contact interactions @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of directed friendly walkers on the square lattice with such interactions @xcite has led to the extension of a key combinatorial technique for lattice paths , the obstinate kernel method @xcite .    to extend these integrable models to the problem of polymer gelation we solve a system of three polymer strands with contact interactions .",
    "we model this system by an ensemble of three directed friendly walkers with shared - vertex interactions on the square lattice .",
    "we introduce two different types of contact interactions that differentiate between situations in which two walks share the same site or all three walks share the same site .",
    "we begin in by constructing our model , first defining the combinatorial class of allowed configurations and subsequently introducing interaction parameters to assign our configurations with corresponding boltzmann weights . in particular , we incorporate two distinct interaction parameters to differentiate between the zipping of only two or all three walks .    in , we introduce two further variables that mark the final vertical distances between our three walks for any given configuration . these auxiliary variables , known as _ catalytic _ variables , are integral to solving our model .",
    "we then establish a mapping between our class of allowed triple - walks onto itself which leads to a functional equation for the model s corresponding generating function that incorporates our added parameters .",
    "we then proceed in to determine an exact solution to the model s generating function by means of the _ obstinate kernel method _ @xcite . while the beginnings of outline the precise steps undertaken , we briefly mention that this technique consists of generating a finite system of distinct functional equations by applying a set of different transformations to our original relation determined in .",
    "we then subsequently collapse our system to construct a new refined functional equation which provides us ( after some further work ) with a solution to our generating function .",
    "equipped with our exact solution of the generating function , we proceed to analyse our model in .",
    "specifically , first considers the dominant singularity behaviour of the generating function for the simplified model where we ignore triple contact effects .",
    "we find that such a model exhibits a single critical point , arising in two distinct phases of our system  namely , a _",
    "free _ and _ gelated _ phase . in we determine that the free to gelated phase transition is a second - order , with a finite jump discontinuity in the second - derivative of free energy .    in",
    "we extend our analysis to the full symmetric model that incorporates both double and triple interaction effects , specifying the regions of the phases and plotting the phase diagram .",
    "while the full phase space is similarly partitioned into two distinct phases , we find the existence of an additional _ first - order _ phase boundary for relatively low double and high triple interaction boltzmann weights .",
    "finally , in , by a simple re - parameterisation , we consider the model that purely isolates double and triple walker interaction effects .",
    "we plot the new phase diagram and use low and high - temperature arguments to explain the limiting behaviour of our phase boundaries .",
    "as one might expect , the order of all phase transitions across the entire phase space remain unchanged .",
    "consider three directed walks along the square integer lattice consisting of an equal number of steps .",
    "all walks begin at the origin and end at the _ same _ site .",
    "moreover , walks only can take steps in either the north - east @xmath0 or south - east @xmath1 direction .",
    "finally , all three walks may share common steps , however none of the walks are able to cross one another .",
    "such walks are typically referred to as ( infinitely ) _ friendly _ walks .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the class of allowed triple walks of _ any _ length .",
    "an example of an allowable configuration is given in .",
    "double shared contact steps and @xmath3 triple shared contact sites .",
    "thus , the overall boltzmann weight for this configuration is @xmath4 , width=300 ]    for any configuration @xmath5 , we assign a weight @xmath6 to the @xmath7 _ shared contact sites _ between the top - to - middle or middle - to - bottom walks respectively . note , that when all three walks share the same site we consider the walk as consisting of _ two _ shared contacts sites with corresponding weight @xmath8 and further the trivial triplet of walks of zero length has weight 1 .",
    "finally , we assign a weight @xmath9 to the @xmath10 _ triple shared contact sites _ where all three walks coincide , hence contributing a total factor of @xmath11 to the overall configuration weight . the partition function for our model consisting of @xmath12 paired steps",
    "is @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the length of the configuration @xmath15 .",
    "the reduced free energy @xmath16 @xmath17 and generating function @xmath18 @xmath19 are defined in the usual manner , where @xmath20 is conjugate to the length of the configuration .",
    "let @xmath21 be the subclass of allowed configurations where _ all _ three walks share a common site only at the very beginning and end of the configuration .",
    "an example of such a configuration is seen in .",
    "we can then define the corresponding _ primitive _ generating function @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath20 is conjugate to the length @xmath14 of a configuration @xmath24 .",
    "note that we can append any two configurations , @xmath25 together to construct a new configuration @xmath26 that now lies in our original class @xmath2 .",
    "more generally any @xmath5 can be uniquely decomposed into a sequence of primitive walks appended to each other as highlighted in .",
    "using the symbolic enumeration formalism described by flajolet and sedgewick @xcite we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the trivial configuration consisting of no steps and @xmath29 at the level of generating functions , this construction translates to the following equation @xmath30 letting @xmath31 we can express our primitive generating function in terms of @xmath32 @xmath33 which further gives us the relation @xmath34 + g(c,1;z)}.\\ ] ] hence to solve for our full model it suffices to solve for the model that ignores triple shared contact effects with corresponding generating function @xmath32 which we will indeed proceed to do in and .",
    "we can establish a functional equation for @xmath32 by considering the effect of appending a triplet of steps to the end of any given configuration @xmath5 .",
    "to begin , we define @xmath35 to be the class of triple walks that consists of configurations with final top to middle walk distance @xmath36 and middle to bottom distance @xmath37 , that still obey friendly constraints . we define our larger combinatorial class @xmath38 as @xmath39 note that our original class of walks in our model @xmath40 . equipped with our larger combinatorial class we can introduce its corresponding generating function @xmath41 that encodes information about the number of steps and shared contacts for each configuration @xmath42 .",
    "however , determining whether appending a triple - step onto a given configuration @xmath15 results in a new and _ allowable _ configuration ( i.e. @xmath15 remains in @xmath43 ) further requires knowledge of the _ final _ step distances between the three walks .",
    "hence , solely for the purpose of establishing our functional equation for @xmath41 , we additionally introduce two catalytic variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 to construct the expanded generating function @xmath46 where @xmath47 and again @xmath20 is conjugate to the length @xmath14 of a configuration @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are conjugate to _ half _ the distance @xmath48 and @xmath49 between the final vertices of the top to middle and middle to bottom walks respectively . for each @xmath42 , powers of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in @xmath50",
    "track the final step distances between the three walks .",
    "due to the allowed step directions , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 must always be even , ensuring that @xmath50 contains only integer powers of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath50 as an element of @xmath51[[z]]$ ] : the ring of formal power series in @xmath20 with coefficients in @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "we aim to solve @xmath52 by establishing a functional equation for @xmath50 .",
    "specifically , we construct a suitable mapping from @xmath43 onto itself by considering the effect of appending an _ allowable _ triple - step onto a configuration , translating this map into its action on the generating function . at the end of",
    "any given walk we can append a step @xmath53 . hence , for a triplet of walks , there are a total of eight possible combinations of triple steps that can be appended onto a configuration .",
    "let @xmath54 be the set of allowable steps , with    @xmath55 that alter the corresponding configuration weight by factors of @xmath20 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "note , in we have used the shorthand @xmath62 to denote the triple - step @xmath63 .",
    "given the non - crossing constraint between the three walks , not all eight combinations of appended steps will necessarily result in allowable configurations and furthermore shared contact interaction effects also need to be considered when attaching new steps .",
    "thus , we identify 22 distinct cases that capture all possible changes in weight that can arise from appending a triplet of steps as seen in , and ; allowing us to construct a functional equation for @xmath50 , highlighting the underlying decomposition for @xmath43 .",
    "+   +    we denote @xmath64 as the trivial zero - length configuration and introduce the following shorthand notation    @xmath65 while @xmath66 represents the class of configurations formed by appending the triple - step @xmath67 to the _ end _ of each triplet of walks @xmath68 .",
    "we can build up our functional equation @xmath46 by firstly establishing a relation for the non - interacting case @xmath69 and subsequently incorporating the effects of shared contacts . to do this we consider the effect of appending a triple - step onto a given configuration , making sure to eliminate newly formed walks that are no longer part of our allowable class @xmath43 .",
