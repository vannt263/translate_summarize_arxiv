    "if @xmath22 happens to lie on the edge of the aperture , then we denote @xmath21 by @xmath23 also , we denote @xmath24 to be the unit vector in the direction of propagation of the incident field , as shown in figure ( 1 ) .",

    "this decomposition realized young s interpretation for the diffraction phenomena : young had once proposed that part of the incident field , which is called the reflected field , undergone a kind of _ reflection _ at the edge of the aperture , and the rest of the incident field , called geometrical field , just _ went through _ the aperture without any perturbation , and , the final diffraction wave was the interference of the two fields @xcite .",
    "but as mentioned earlier , equation ( [ psi kirchhoff ] ) was derived based on inconsistent boundary conditions . now , with the b.c.s proposed by sommerfeld ( equation ( [ bc consistent ] ) )",
    ", we are able to modify equation ( [ psi rubinowicz ] ) and obtain another similar expression which is not only mathematically - consistent , but also preserves young s `` field - splitting '' interpretation .    furthermore , equation ( [ psi rubinowicz ] )",
    "is not entirely satisfactory in the sense that the two separated fields are not continuous at the boundary of the illuminated region .",
    "this problem had been discussed by john .",
    "s asvestas , and he also gave an elegant `` solid - angle '' representation of @xmath1 which successfully avoided such discontinuity .",
    "however , asvestas work was also based on kirchhoff s formula , and therefore the mathematical inconsistency still exists .",
    "besides that , the solid - angle representation derived by asvestas does not reduce to electrostatic case in the long wavelength limit @xmath34 in this paper , we will give a slightly different decomposition formula with consistent boundary conditions and generalize the electrostatic result to the diffraction problem .",
    "another unsatisfactory feature of rubinowicz decomposition formula equation ( [ psi rubinowicz ] ) is that the functional form of the line integral is not what one would expect an ordinary reflection wave should be , due to some confusing factors in the integrand . and",
    "therefore in this paper , we will also derive a neater representation of the line integral that mimics the behavior of ordinary reflection in geometrical optics .    in the last section",
    ", we ll explain why the boundary conditions ( equation ( [ bc consistent ] ) ) is more suitable by compare the result of our work with sommerfeld s 2-d straight - edge diffraction problem , which is the one of the few examples where the helmholtz equation has an exact solution .",
    "we ll see that kirchhoff s solution has a relative deviation from the exact solution .",
    "with the boundary conditions equation ( [ bc consistent ] ) , we begin from sommerfeld s integral formula equation ( [ psi sommerfeld ] ) . since @xmath35 on the aperture , we add it back into the integrand and rearrange a little:@xmath36 and in the last line we identify the first integral is nothing but equation ( [ psi kirchhoff ] ) and thus equal to equation ( [ psi rubinowicz ] ) .",

    "in ordinary geometrical optics , the reflection phenomena can be comprehended this way : given a source distribution , one draw the `` image source '' behind the `` mirror , '' as shown in figure ( 3 ) , where there is a point real source labeled by @xmath42 , and the reflected field is equal to the incident field from the image point @xmath43 .",
    "so , if what young really meant ( in the early days when he saw the diffraction phenomena ) by `` reflection at the edge '' was the reflection in geometrical optics , then we _ expect _ the line integral should take the form@xmath44    namely , as shown in figure ( 4 ) , we imagine that the screen has a finite thickness , and as the incident field @xmath12 comes in , it is reflected by the `` cut '' around the aperture , and thus when the reflected field reaches the field point @xmath45 the incident field @xmath12 has propagated for a total optical length @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47 should take the form as equation ( [ expected reflective plane ] ) or ( [ expected reflective point ] ) .",
    "these expectations actually can be accomplished by some deformations of equation ( [ psi complete ] ) , but let s do it another way : to derive the @xmath48 from the beginning equation ( [ psi sommerfeld ] ) , and this will make derivation more neater .",
    "simplify equation ( [ psi sommerfeld ] ) a little , and we get@xmath49 where @xmath50 and let @xmath51 be the inward unit normal to the screen ( @xmath52 ) . to simplify the result , we consider the following two cases :    * case 1 .",

    "<S> however , this decomposition is not entirely satisfactory in the sense that the two separated fields are discontinuous at the boundary of the illuminated region . </S>",
    "<S> also , the functional form of the line - integral is not what one would expect an ordinary reflection wave should be due to some confusing factors in the integrand . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the boundary conditions on the screen imposed by kirchhoff s approximation are mathematically inconsistent , and therefore , rigorously , this decomposition formulation must be slightly modified by taking into account the correct b.c.s . </S>",
    "<S> + in this thesis , we use the consistent boundary conditions to derive a slightly different decomposition formula which shows that the behavior of the diffracted wave at the edge is exactly just like an ordinary reflection  realizing the conjecture of thomas young in the 18@xmath0 century . </S>",
    "<S> we also derived another decomposition formula which avoids mathematical discontinuity encountered by rubinowicz . in the last section </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that our solution is consistent with that obtained by sommerfeld in the rigorous 2-d plane - wave diffraction problem , so our formulation in this sense may describe more accurately the behavior of diffracted wave near the edge of the aperture than kirchhoff s formula . </S>"
