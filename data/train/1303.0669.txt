    "the random number generation is one of the most basic problems in the information theory .",
    "the purpose of the random number generation is to approximate a sequence of target probability distributions @xmath2 by transforming a sequence of another probability distributions @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath2 or @xmath3 is a uniform distribution , each problem corresponds to the uniform random number generation problem or the resolvability problem respectively , and has been well studied .",
    "for example , when @xmath3 and @xmath2 are the i.i.d .",
    "probability distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the uniform distribution with the support size @xmath7 , the optimal first order generation rate @xmath8 from @xmath4 is the entropy @xmath9 under the condition that the error goes to @xmath10 .",
    "those problems are analyzed not only in the context of the first order asymptotic theory but also that in the second asymptotic theory . in the most general case",
    ", it is known that the first and the second order optimal rates in those problems can be described by the information spectrum methods @xcite . in particular , for transformation between @xmath4 and @xmath11 , the results in the information spectrum gives optimal rates @xmath8 and @xmath12 . on the other hand , when both @xmath3 and @xmath2 are not a uniform , the problem has not been treated sufficiently . in this paper",
    ", we do not restrict both @xmath3 and @xmath2 to a uniform distribution and focus on the second order asymptotics of a random number generation for arbitrary i.i.d .",
    "probability distributions on a finite set .",
    "in particular , we derive the optimal second order generation rate under an arbitrary permissible confident coefficient .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize the notion of the majorization .",
    "it is a pre - order between two probability distributions which can be defined on different finite sets . if a probability distribution @xmath3 is transformed to @xmath13 by a deterministic transformation @xmath14 , the transformed probability distribution @xmath13 `` majorizes '' the original probability distribution @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", @xmath13 is larger than @xmath3 in the sense of the majorization relation . therefore , when we want to approximate a target probability distribution @xmath2 from an original probability distribution @xmath3 , for an arbitrary deterministic transformation @xmath14 , there is a probability distribution @xmath15 which majorizes @xmath3 and is close to @xmath2 than @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the performance of the optimization under the majorization condition gives a bound of that under deterministic transformations .",
    "the majorization is used in a transformation theory of quantum entangled states and corresponds to a operation called locc in the quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "our results can be extended to the quantum settings but we do not mention it in this paper .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a notion of majorization , and consider approximation problems under a majorization condition and by a deterministic transformation . in section iii , we treat the first order asymptotics for the approximation problem and derive the first order optimal rate under the i.i.d . setting . in section iv , we review the existing studies about the second order asymptotics of the approximation problem when the source distribution or the target distribution is a uniform distribution . in section",
    "v , we treat the second order asymptotics of the approximation problem when both the source distribution and the target distribution are not a uniform distribution .",
    "we note that the results itself in section v do not contain that in section iv .",
    "but , in the end of section v , we show that the result in section iv can be regarded as the limit case of the sesult in section v. in section vi , we state the conclusion of the paper .",
    "in this section , we introduce some notation and definition , and formulate our problem . for a probability distribution @xmath0 on finite set @xmath16 and a map @xmath17",
    ", the probability distribution @xmath18 on @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce a value @xmath21 called the bhattacharyya coefficient or the fidelity between probability distributions over the same discrete set @xmath19 as @xmath22 this value @xmath21 represents how close two probability distributions are and relates to the hellinger distance @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "then our main purpose is to analyze the following value .",
    "@xmath25 this means the maximal number @xmath26 of @xmath27 which can be approximated from @xmath0 under a confidence coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "when we define the maximal fidelity @xmath29 from @xmath0 on @xmath16 to @xmath1 on @xmath19 by @xmath30 then @xmath31 is rewritten as @xmath32    next , we will introduce the notion of the majorization to evaluate @xmath29 . for",
    "a probability distribution @xmath0 on a finite set , let @xmath33 be a sequence @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the element of @xmath36 sorted in decreasing order for @xmath37 and @xmath35 is @xmath10 for @xmath38 .",
    "we set as @xmath39 . when probability distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy @xmath40 for any @xmath41 , it is said that @xmath0 is majorized by @xmath1 and written as @xmath42 . here , note that the sets where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined do not necessarily coincide with each other .",
    "the majorization relation is a pre - order on a set of probability distributions in which each distribution is defined on a finite set@xcite .",
    "we introduce the maximal fidelity under the majorization condition .",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are probability distribution on @xmath16 and @xmath19 , respectively .",

    ", @xmath46 is easily treatable than @xmath29 . in particular",
    ", the value of @xmath46 can be explicitly described in one - shot situation @xcite .",
    "we proceed to the asymptotics of random number generation . here",
    ", we assume the form @xmath4 and @xmath47 as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the last section . then , we call @xmath48 the first order rate . in this section ,",
    "we derive the dependency of @xmath49 for the first order rate @xmath8 when @xmath50 goes to the infinity . the following theorem",
    "say that the threshold value of the first order rate is the ratio of the entropy of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "therefore , we fix the first order rate @xmath8 to @xmath52 and analyze the second order rate in the next section .",

    "+ these problems are essentially equivalent . to derive the second order asymptotic expansion under a confidence coefficient @xmath28 ,",
    "we focus on the following value which means the optimal second order rate . @xmath61",
    "if the above value is finite , the second order asymptotic expansion of @xmath54 is represented as @xmath62    we review the results for the uniform random number generation and the resolvability in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the uniform distribution with the support size @xmath7 .",

    "[ 2-order error ] let @xmath0 be any probability distribution on a finite set except for a uniform distribution .",
    "then @xmath63 where @xmath9 is the entropy of @xmath0 and @xmath64    from theorem [ 2-order error ] , it turned out that the limit of the maximal fidelity depend on the second order rate @xmath12 when @xmath56 . note that the limit value does not depend on the second order rate @xmath12 when @xmath65 is given by theorem [ first order error ] .",
