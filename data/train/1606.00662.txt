    "<S> the compromise hypothesis assumes people tend to agree when they interact . under the bounded confidence it is possible only in the case when their opinions are close enough . </S>",
    "<S> the last assumption has some mathematical reason beneath : the master equation could be derived for the case of local interactions only ( i.e. , when two opinions are close enough , @xmath2 ) . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we will show that it can be extended even for of long - range interactions .    </S>",

    "<S> another class of theories holds that merely knowing one is different from others is unimportant . </S>",

    "<S> let us mention that this equation can not be solved numerically due to high amplifications of numerical errors , given that it is not well - posed@xcite .    if we remove the bounded confidence hypothesis , we can not longer take the continuous limit as before , and a new equation appears . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to solve the equation explicitly using a method developed by li and toscani @xcite , which permits to find the exact solutions of the continuous approximation of the master equations that govern the evolution of the system , and then compare them with numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we get a non - local porous media equation ( different from the one obtained in @xcite , which can be thought also as a first order hyperbolic equation with a nonlinear non - local flux ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the distribution of agent s opinions converges to a dirac s delta function concentrated at the mean opinion of the initial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> let us observe that this partial differential equation develops a shock at the median of the distribution , and the median value moves toward the mean .    </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that in the model of deffuant et al @xcite the step of the dynamics is a weighted average of the agent s opinions , and thus , it is always proportional to the difference between the two opinions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present case it is always of the same order , and each agent moves his opinion by a fixed amount towards the other agent s opinion . </S>",
    "<S> although the equations obtained are similar , we can further relax the bounded confidence hypothesis obtaining a better description of social processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in the first section </S>",
    "<S> we derive the analytical solutions for the bounded confidence dynamics , and we obtain an equation similar to the one of deffuant et al @xcite . in the second section , we show that it is possible to derive the master equation when the hypothesis of bounded confidence is relaxed and long range interactions are included . in the last section </S>",
