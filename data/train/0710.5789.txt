    "there is mounting observational evidence for the association between long - soft @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) and broad - lined type ic supernovae ( sne ; see woosley & bloom 2006 for a review ) .",

    "the engine that converts energy from long - term accretion of disk material onto the black - hole ( bh ) may power a relativistic jet in the excavated polar regions .",

    "the numerical procedure we follow is identical to that of b07 in every respect , except the choice of progenitor .",
    "wh06 s model is evolved from a 35 zero - age main sequence star endowed with a total angular momentum of 1.4@xmath410@xmath5erg@xmath6s , a metallicity of 1% the solar value , and a reduction by a factor of 10 in the prescribed mass loss rates during the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "our simulations extend out to a maximum radius of 5000 km ( which contains @xmath33 ) and cover a 90@xmath7 quadrant , bounded by the rotation axis and the equator .",
    "we adopt wh06 s initial rotational , density , temperature , and electron - fraction profiles for that progenitor . for the magnetic field distribution , we start with magnitudes and morphology that are consistent with the 35oc model of wh06 .",
    "we use a field uniform within 3000 km , and dipolar beyond . in our reference model ,",
    "m0 , we employ initial poloidal and toroidal field magnitudes of 2@xmath410@xmath8 g and 8@xmath410@xmath9 g , respectively , in close quantitative agreement with the 35oc model of wh06 .",
    "however , we also study a model , m1 , with an initial poloidal field that is five times stronger .",
    "this leads to a magnetic field energy at @xmath3100ms after core bounce that is closer to the value expected at the pns surface , were we to adequately resolve the mri ( b07 ) . in table  1 ,",
    "we give important quantities characterizing the two simulations performed .",
    "note that if magnetic fields are ignored in the pre - collapse evolutionary calculations of wh06 , core angular velocities reach 5 - 22rads@xmath10 , much larger than the 1.98rads@xmath10 achieved in the 35oc model .",
    "a bounce at sub - nuclear densities may ensue and lead to bh formation ( akiyama & wheeler 2005 ) .",
    "ignoring magnetic torques in the models most prone to magnetic - field generation during the pre - collapse phase seems inconsistent .",
    "thus , we focus on the more slowly rotating progenitors , evolved with magnetic fields , which inevitably bounce at nuclear densities .",
    "after an initial collapse phase that lasts @xmath3245ms , the central density reaches @xmath33@xmath410@xmath11g@xmath12 , the eos stiffens , a shock is born , and propagates outward , but is debilitated by the photo - dissociation of the infalling outer iron - core and the burst of electron neutrinos .",
    "the shock stalls at @xmath3150 km , and within a few tens of ms after bounce , it becomes increasingly aspherical .",
    "the net gain from neutrino emission and absorption processes , the entropy , and the material accretion rates get progressively larger at larger latitudes as the degree of oblateness of the fast - rotating pns increases .",
    "subsequent to the amplification due to compression by a factor of @xmath32500 in both magnetic field components , the toroidal magnetic field increases after bounce due to the winding of the poloidal field component . at the same time , accretion of",
    "the outer magnetized core continues and enhances the total magnetic field energy . by 150ms ( 300ms ) after bounce , the magnetic pressure at the surface of the pns along the pole in the m1 ( m0 ) model is comparable to the gas pressure , and a bipolar , magnetically - driven , baryon - loaded , and non - relativistic jet is initiated , reversing accretion into ejection along the polar direction . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_prop ] , the initial jet mass - loss rate is only @xmath30.01m@xmath13s@xmath10 , but in the m1 model and by @xmath3350ms after bounce it _ exceeds _ the accretion rate . at this time",
    ", the accumulated baryonic pns mass is only 1.93 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_prop ] ) , and , thus , well below the 2.17 baryonic mass transition to bh formation that we derive with our shen eos ( shen et al .",
    "note that for a solid - body rotator this limit may increase by up to 10 - 20% ( cook et al .",
    "1994 ) , but for a differentially - rotating neutron star this limit may be considerably larger ( baumgarte et al .",
    "hence , rotation , and in particular differential rotation , enhances the potential for explosion during a pns phase . by 650ms after bounce , the explosion energy in the m1 model reaches @xmath33.3b ( 10@xmath14erg @xmath15 1bethe [ 1b ] ) ( see right panel of fig .  [ fig_prop ] ) , although due to the continued accretion along near - equatorial latitudes a quasi - steady - state is reached with an explosion power sustained at @xmath310bs@xmath10 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_still ] , the jet resembles a magnetic tower ( lynden - bell 2003 ; uzdenski & macfadyen 2001 ) , but is confined primarily by the ram pressure of the infalling dense envelope ( b07 ) .",
    "as time progresses , its base broadens and , given the quasi - steady jet conditions , the mass ejection rate grows and the accretion is limited to progressively smaller latitudes . both cause and effect , the increase in ejecta volume enhances the neutrino contribution to the explosion energy , although it remains a subdominant part of the total by the end of the simulation .",
    "extraction of core rotational energy by magnetic torques is also in evidence in the m1 model from the increase in the average pns rotation periodg@xmath12 isodensity contour.[footnote_period ] ] from 8 to 12ms between 200ms and 600ms after bounce , while over half this interval the average period decreases from 5 to 4ms in the weakly exploding m0 model .",
    "the decrease in the free energy of rotation in the m1 model is on the order of 3b , and is comparable to the magnitude of the explosion energy .",
    "this supports the idea that core rotation energy fuels the magnetically - driven ejecta .",
    "hence , the m1 model , modified slightly to yield fields at saturation that agree roughly with what would obtain in the presence of the mri , boasts a clear and powerful explosion . in this model , and once the explosion is well established , the pns loses mass at a steady rate , and has a mass of only @xmath31.7 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the broadening of the base of the jet suggests that the explosion will not choke ( nor induce any significant fallback ) , and encompassing a larger solid angle , will instead lead to explosion in all directions .",
    "hence , such an object is unlikely ever to transition to a bh and to lead to a collapsar .",
    "by contrast , in the m0 model , the explosion emerges later , when the neutron star baryonic mass has already accumulated @xmath32.1 , and thence may be susceptible to collapse to a bh",
    ". the free - energy of core rotation has been partially tapped , but the potential subsequent powering of a grb may not be compromised .",
    "this model , by mimicking more slowly rotating cores or an inefficient mri , offers a limiting case for the formation or non - formation of a bh , and a possible collapsar .",
    "the potential for exponential growth on a rotational timescale of initial seed magnetic fields by the mri ( shibata et al .",
    "2006 ; etienne et al . 2006 ) , fueled by the free energy of core rotation , makes the initial angular momentum budget of the progenitor star the key parameter in determining the outcome during the immediate post - bounce phase ( b07 ) .",
    "a magnetically - driven , baryon - loaded , and non - relativistic , explosion is obtained for wh06 s 35oc collapsar candidate model , evolved at low metallicity from a 35 fast - rotating main - sequence star .",
    "the explosion occurs @xmath3200ms after bounce and reaches @xmath33b @xmath3400ms later . after an initial accretion phase ,",
    "the steadily decreasing pns mass reaches only @xmath31.7 at the end of the simulation , and , thus , the quasi - steady explosion we observe suggests that bh formation is unlikely to occur .",
    "moreover , baryon contamination prevents the ejecta from becoming relativistic .",
    "note that the production of a grb in the collapsar context is contingent on the gravitational collapse of the pns to a bh .",
    "the recent stellar evolutionary calculations of yoon & langer ( 2005 ) , wh06 , and meynet & maeder ( 2007 ) of fast - rotating main - sequence objects at low metallicity systematically predict such fast - rotating cores at collapse . starting from similar conditions for a 35 - 40 star , but using different mass - loss `` recipes ,",
    "'' they obtain very similar rotational profiles in the inner core . allowing for anisotropic mass loss ( meynet & maeder 2007 ) , a model of c. georgy ( 2007 , priv .",
    "comm . ) suggests an even larger ( by a factor of two ) specific angular momentum in the inner 3 at the end of silicon core burning . despite the agreement between these different evolutionary computations , the magnetically - driven explosion and the `` failed '' bh formation described here are conditional on the uncertain treatment of mass loss , angular momentum transport , and magnetic processes ( spruit 2002 ) during the pre - collapse evolution .    at very low metallicities ,",
    "radiatively - driven winds of massive stars are inhibited by the lack of metals ( kudritzki 2002 ; vink et al .",
    "2001 ; vink & de koter 2005 ) , whose optically - thick lines intercept radiation momentum ( castor et al . 1975 ) .",
    "recent revisions downward of mass - loss rates due to clumping ( owocki et al .",
    "1988 ; bouret et al . 2005 ; fullerton et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest , however , the potential importance of episodic outbursts , akin to the 1843 giant eruption of eta carina ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence of such phenomena is entirely unknown , mostly because the fundamental cause of the outburst remains a mystery .",
    "while line driving seems excluded , continuum driving of a porous medium at super - eddington luminosities has been proposed by owocki et al .",
    "( 2004 ) as an alternative .",
    "finally , mass loss in fast - rotating , and sometimes critically - rotating ( townsend et al .",
    "2004 ) , envelopes is complicated by the effects associated with centrifugal support , surface oblateness , and gravity - darkening ( cranmer & owocki 1995 ; owocki et al .",
    "1996 ) , so that the mass - loss `` recipes '' used in stellar evolutionary models are not always substantiated by observational and theoretical evidence . at present , and in light of our simulations , it appears that chemically - homogeneous evolution of fast - rotating main - sequence massive stars at low metallicity systematically yields iron cores at collapse that may have _ too much _ angular momentum , a property that prevents the formation of a collapsar .",
    "uncertainties in the modeling of the pre - collapse evolution may result , however , in slower - rotating iron cores is a stiff function of angular velocity @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 . ] and , thus , might inhibit an early magnetically - driven explosion in favor of black hole , and perhaps collapsar , formation .",
    "we conclude that variations in the angular momentum distribution of pre - collapse massive stars may lead to different post - bounce scenarios .",
    "non- or slowly - rotating progenitors may explode with weak / moderate energy ( @xmath181b ) through a neutrino or an acoustic mechanism @xmath181s after bounce , or may collapse to a bh .",
    "objects with large angular momentum in the envelope , but little in the core , may proceed through the pns phase , transition to a bh and form a collapsar with a grb signature . owing to the modest magnetic - field amplification above the pns , a weak precursor polar jet",
    "may be launched , soon overtaken by a baryon - free , collimated relativistic jet . at the same time , the progenitor envelope is exploded by a disk wind , resulting in a hypernova - like sn with a large luminosity ( large @xmath1ni mass ) .",
    "finally , and this is what we conclude here , objects with large angular momentum in the core may not transition to a bh . instead , and fueled by core - rotation energy ,",
    "a magnetically - driven baryon - loaded non - relativistic jet is obtained without any grb signature .",
    "the explosion has the potential of reaching energies of a few b to 10b , and for viewers along the poles of looking like a type ic hypernova - like sn with broad lines . for a viewer at lower latitudes , the delayed and less energetic explosion nearer",
    "the equator may look more like a standard type ic sn ( hflich et al .",
    "this volume - restricted jet - like explosion is dimmer , as the amount of processed @xmath1ni may be significantly less than the @xmath30.5 obtained in the collapsar context ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "hence , magnetic processes during the post - bounce phase of fast - rotating iron cores offer a potential alternative to collapsar formation and long - soft grbs by producing non - relativistic non - poynting - flux - dominated baryon - loaded hypernova - like explosions without any grb signature .",
    "importantly , while our study narrows the range over which the collapsar model may exist , it also offers additional routes to explain the existence of grb / sn - hypernova events like sn 1998bw ( woosley et al .",
    "1999 ) , and hypernova events like sn 2002ap without a grb signature ( mazzali et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "more generally , magnetic effects should naturally arise in the context of gravitational collapse and fast rotation .",
    "the resulting angular momentum of newly - formed bhs and magnetars , for example , would be reduced , perhaps considerably , by any prior magnetically - driven explosion , and , thus , may decrease the power of subsequent mass ejections from compact objects ( see , e.g. , thompson et al 2004 ) .",
