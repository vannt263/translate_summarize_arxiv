    "understanding the nature of dark matter ( dm ) remains one of the most important outstanding problems in cosmology . if dm is a new fundamental particle , it may experience new non - gravitational interactions that would manifest as a violation of the weak equivalence principle .",
    "such dm forces should be observationally constrained on all scales where dm influences structure , from the subgalactic out to the hubble radius . in important early work , frieman and gradwohl @xcite recognized that dm forces would violate the equivalence principle , and considered cosmological constraints on dm forces of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is newton s constant , @xmath2 is the mass of a dm particle , @xmath3 is the separation between particles , @xmath4 is a `` screening length '' beyond which the force is suppressed , and @xmath5 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the relative strength of this force compared to gravity . is identical to that in @xcite and @xcite but differs from that in my earlier papers @xcite . in my earlier papers",
    "@xmath5 was the charge - to - mass ratio for the dm particles instead of the ratio between the dm force itself and gravity .",
    "the dm force is proportional to the square of the charge as in electromagnetism .",
    "the @xmath5 in this paper is therefore equal to @xmath6 in my previous papers @xcite .",
    "] observations at the time of frieman and gradwohl s work excluded dm forces with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "dm forces received renewed attention after it was realized that they were generically produced by a coupling to dark energy @xcite and could arise naturally in string theory @xcite .",
    "they also might agree better with observations than the standard cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) scenario of structure formation @xcite .",
    "kesden and kamionkowski ( @xcite , hereafter kk06 ) examined the effects of dm forces on tidally disrupting satellite galaxies , where the large difference between the mass @xmath10 of the satellite galaxy and that of the host galaxy @xmath11 establishes a hierarchy in the relevant energy scales of the problem . assuming that the screening length @xmath12 , an attractive dm force increases the satellite s orbital energy per unit mass @xmath13 by a factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the distance between the satellite and host galaxies and @xmath16 is the dm mass fraction in the satellite or host .",
    "a tidally disrupted star will end up in the leading ( trailing ) stream if its binding energy per unit mass is less ( greater ) than the typical energy @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the radius of the satellite galaxy . equating the change in orbital energy induced by dm forces to the binding energy at the tidal radius @xmath18 we find that dm forces will produce an order unity change in the ratio of the number of stars in the leading to those in the trailing tidal streams when @xmath19    kk06 applied their constraints to the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy , a milky way satellite approximately @xmath20 kpc from the galactic center discovered in 1994 @xcite after the publication of frieman and gradwohl s work .",
    "the sgr dwarf has leading and trailing stellar tidal streams stretching hundreds of degrees across the sky that have been observed extensively by the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the proposed mass - to - light ratio @xmath21 of the sgr dwarf suggests that it is dm dominated , as is the milky way at the perigalactic and apogalactic distances of the sgr orbit , about 15 and 60 kpc respectively @xcite .",
    "the current bound mass of the sgr dwarf is @xmath22 , implying @xmath23 . inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ e : beta_lim ] ) along with @xmath24 , we find that dm forces several percent the strength of gravity should induce order unity changes in the leading - to - trailing ratio of stars in the sgr tidal streams .",
    "n - body simulations confirmed that @xmath25 completely eliminated the leading tidal stream for a wide range of models of the satellite galaxy , host galaxy , and satellite orbit .",
    "kk06 thus conservatively excluded @xmath26 , as the sgr tidal streams are observed to be roughly symmetric .",
    "keselman , nusser , and peebles ( @xcite , hereafter knp09 ) have proposed an alternative scenario in which observations of the sgr dwarf could be consistent with @xmath27 dm forces . in this proposal ,",
    "the differential acceleration experienced by stars and dm segregate them from each other well before the first simulated pericentric passage .",
    "the self - bound stellar remnant of sgr is free of dm and thus immune to dm forces .",
    "it proceeds to develop symmetric tidal streams in the galactic gravitational potential well .",
    "the absence of a sgr dm halo leaves the remaining stars more vulnerable to tidal heating during pericentric passages .",
    "the resulting heightened velocity dispersion could be misinterpreted as evidence for dm if the virial theorem was misapplied to this highly nonvirialized system .",
    "knp09 argues that just such a misinterpretation could explain the high observed mass - to - light ratio @xmath21 of sgr , which would otherwise be incompatible with the complete segregation of stars and dm required by @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , the initial conditions used in the simulations presented in knp09 are not appropriate for describing this alternative scenario for the formation of the sgr tidal streams .",
    "these simulations begin with the satellite galaxy s stellar and dm distributions moving with the same velocity and centered about the same point in the host galaxy s halo . in the absence of dm forces , two distributions with the same location and velocity",
    "are guaranteed to be gravitationally bound to each other .",
    "however , dm forces change the orbital energy of the dm particles by an amount @xmath28 that for @xmath29 exceeds the energy @xmath30 binding these particles to the satellite .",
    "knp09 notes that dm forces induce `` a nearly complete segregation of the stars and dm well before the first pericentric passage . '' for these initial conditions , the stars and dm are already widely separated in orbital energy before the simulations even begin , though they initially coincide in phase space .",
    "this point is dramatized by noting that if these simulations were run backwards in time , by symmetry the stars and dm would be segregated just as efficiently .",
    "these simulations actually describe the temporary coincidental convergence of two different satellites , one purely stellar and the other pure dm , moving independently on very different orbits in the host galaxy s halo .",
    "proper initial conditions would show that this scenario can not produce a purely stellar satellite with symmetric tidal streams like the sgr dwarf .",
    "the segregation of stars and dm seen in these simulations will happen on the very first approach of the satellite galaxy to the galactic center , long before dynamical friction can put the satellite onto an orbit resembling that of the current sgr dwarf .",
    "the satellite will have fallen in from distances greater than the host galaxy s virial radius , and having been accelerated by a @xmath29 dm force will be moving at a velocity well above the gravitational escape velocity of the system .",
    "once segregated from their dm halo , the satellite stars will be moving on a hyperbolic orbit and will be ejected from the host galaxy after a single pericentric passage .",
    "we have identified three conditions that must be satisfied for the knp09 scenario for the formation of the sgr tidal streams to be viable :    1 .",
    "the dm force must be strong enough that differential acceleration in the galactic halo fully segregates the stars and dm prior to the formation of the tidal streams .",

    "this assumption is difficult to reconcile with theoretical arguments suggesting that feedback and reionization suppress star formation in low - mass halos @xcite , but we will consider it as a starting point .",
    "the satellite and host galaxies described in sec .  [ s : gal ] must satisfy three distinct constraints if their interaction is to produce a tidally disrupting system with symmetric tidal streams in the presence of a @xmath29 dm force .",
    "we will identify and describe these three constraints in the three subsections below .",
    "kk06 showed that dm - dominated satellite galaxies will develop asymmetric tidal streams in the presence of dm forces .",
    "knp09 argues that this can be avoided if nearly all of the dm is removed from the satellite galaxy before its stellar tidal streams begin to form .",
    "as the satellite galaxy descends deeper into the potential well of the host galaxy , both stars and dm will be stripped away by conventional gravitational tidal forces .",
    "this occurs because parts of the satellite at different distances from the center of the host galaxy experience different gravitational accelerations .",
    "the weak equivalence principle implies that at the _ same _ position , all objects experience the _ same _ gravitational acceleration .",
    "however , dm forces violate the equivalence principle and individual stars , individual dm particles , and the partly stellar , partly dm satellite galaxy will experience three different accelerations towards the host galaxy s dm halo . in a reference frame freely falling with the satellite as a whole , the individual stars will experience a relative acceleration @xmath61 while the dm particles experience a relative acceleration @xmath62 in the absence of dm forces ( @xmath63 ) , these relative accelerations vanish as required by the equivalence principle .",

    "we have @xmath89 which demonstrates one of the concerns with this simulation .",
    "although the satellite begins the simulation with its dm halo intact out to the virial radius @xmath59 , this extended halo should have been disrupted at much greater distances from the host galaxy . since @xmath90 , the satellite should not have _ any _ dm halo at all .",
    "these initial conditions represent a temporary association of stars and dm moving independently in the galactic halo , like ships passing in the night . to properly simulate this scenario ,",
    "the satellite s orbit must evolve from that on which the dm was fully segregated ( @xmath91 ) to the current orbit needed to produce the observed stellar tidal streams .",
    "dynamical friction drives this orbital evolution , but was neglected in knp09 since the streams develop on a few orbital times @xmath92 and according to @xcite the dynamical - friction time @xmath93 is much longer than this for the sgr - milky way system .",
    "in response to this paper , knp09 performed a new simulation with a `` live '' dm halo for the host galaxy that allowed for dynamical friction and a more massive satellite @xmath94 that would reduce the dynamical - friction time @xmath95 .",
    "the satellite also began on an orbit with a greater apocentric distance @xmath96 kpc to allow for orbital evolution .",
    "a detailed analysis of this new simulation is beyond the scope of this paper , but it should be examined whether this live halo can adequately describe the dynamical friction given that the final satellite mass is @xmath97 and the individual n - body particles of the host galaxy s dm halo have masses of @xmath98 .",
    "the segregation distance @xmath72 kpc for the sgr dwarf is comparable to the current distances of the newly discovered ultrafaint sdss dwarf galaxies segue 1 , ursa major ii , willman 1 , and coma , all of which lie within 50 kpc of the galactic center .",
    "these new ultrafaint dwarf galaxies have a wide range of luminosities @xmath99 , yet share a common central density @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "simulations show that tidal heating can not inflate the velocity dispersions of these satellites enough to eliminate the need for massive dm halos @xcite .",
    "the satellites less luminous than sgr will thus have higher dm fractions @xmath83 and correspondingly higher relative accelerations @xmath84 for stars according to eq .",
    "( [ e : astarhost ] ) .",
    "the common central density however implies that the restoring acceleration @xmath68 for the stars will remain largely independent of satellite luminosity .",
    "the stars should therefore be fully stripped from their dm halos at greater distances than @xmath101 kpc for the more massive sgr dwarf .",
    "this is not observed for segue 1 , the closest of the new dwarf satellites , whose galactocentric distance of 28 kpc @xcite is well within its predicted @xmath102 for @xmath29 .",
    "although the ultrafaint dwarf satellites appear to place even tighter constraints on dm forces , if we restrict our attention to sgr we see that a @xmath29 dm force is strong enough to segregate stars and dm in sgr at distances @xmath103 before the stellar tidal streams begin to form .",
    "the first of our three criteria for sgr to form symmetric tidal streams as proposed in knp09 is thus satisfied .",
    "even if dm forces are strong enough to fully segregate a satellite galaxy s stars from their dm halo , the segregated stars may not survive as a self - bound object after being pulled free .",
    "the survival of an intact stellar core is essential to the scenario proposed in knp09 , as it is this remnant that subsequently develops the symmetric tidal streams observed today .",
    "the stellar core is threatened with destruction at three distinct stages :    1 .",
    "the satellite galaxy may be stripped of all its stars before the stars and dm are fully segregated .",
    "the stellar component of the satellite may never have been self - bound , but merely held together by the gravity of the satellite s dm halo .",
    "3 .   even if the stars are initially self - bound , they may be tidally disrupted by the satellite s dm halo as it is segregated .",
    "we will explore each of these threats in turn in the remainder of this subsection .",
    "we saw in the previous subsection that stars will be stripped from the satellite when the sum of the gravitational tidal acceleration and the relative acceleration @xmath84 exceed the restoring acceleration @xmath68 , while dm particles will be stripped when the same inequality is reached between @xmath71 and @xmath69 .",
    "this establishes a competition between stars and dm : if the dm profile is sufficiently cuspy or the satellite is sufficiently dm - dominated , there may not be a stellar remnant left when the satellite finally reaches @xmath102 .",
    "returning to the accelerations plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : acc ] , we see that at large @xmath15 the total relative acceleration for stars shown by the solid red curve in the right - hand panel was above the total relative acceleration for dm shown by the solid blue curve .",
    "if the satellite s dm halo had been more massive or less extended compared to the stellar component , @xmath83 would have remained close to unity and the total relative acceleration for stars could have exceeded the maximum of the lower black curve in the left - hand panel before this happened for the dm at @xmath102 . in this case , all of the stars exterior to this maximum located at @xmath104 would have been disrupted into asymmetric tidal streams .",
    "a small stellar remnant would remain because all of the stars interior to @xmath105 would have been stripped _",

    "the stars would slide out of their dm halo like `` an egg sliding off a frying pan '' @xcite , and the stars would be more likely to remain self - bound . in the competition to remain bound to the satellite galaxy , stars are more likely to defeat dm if stellar densities are high and centrally concentrated , while the dm density profile s logarithmic slope scales as @xmath108 over a wide range .      after being segregated from its dm halo , the stellar remnant may no longer have enough self - gravity to remain bound .",
    "unbound stars in the host galaxy s halo would develop into an orphan stream lacking a clear progenitor .",

    "the tidal interactions between comparable - mass systems like the satellite stellar and dm distributions are extremely difficult to model analytically , necessitating the n - body simulations used by both kk06 and knp09 .",

    "this is a significant concern , as even in the absence of dm forces the energy @xmath149 gained during tidal disruption can sometimes unbind stars in the trailing tidal stream from the host galaxy .",

    ". an n - body simulation will be required to determine which of these effects dominates for a particular model .",
    "just such a simulation was performed in the latest version of knp09 in response to the concerns expressed in this paper .",
    "this simulation has precisely the features necessary to avoid ejecting the stellar remnant of sgr from the galactic halo .",
    "the extraordinarily massive sgr dwarf @xmath167 experiences strong dynamical friction according to eq .",
    "( [ e : df ] ) , and its large tangential velocity @xmath168 km / s allows time for this dynamical friction to remove orbital energy before the first close approach to the galactic center .",
    "this simulation demonstrates a possible scenario in which the sgr dwarf could arrive on its present orbit in the presence of @xmath169 dm forces , however several questions remain .",
    "the sgr dwarf loses more than 99% of its stellar mass during the course of the simulation .",
    "is this large a contribution to the galactic stellar halo consistent with observations ?",
    "although the galactic dm halo has now been made of `` live '' particles to allow for dynamical friction , the galactic disk is still modeled by a static potential .",
    "can the galactic disk ( @xmath170 @xcite ) survive an encounter with such a massive satellite , particularly in the presence of dm forces ?",
    "the simulated galactic dm halo consists of @xmath171 particles , each of mass @xmath98 .",
    "is this sufficient to resolve the dynamical friction on the sgr stellar core , which also has a mass @xmath172 after losing 99% of its mass to tidal disruption ? while this new simulation is intriguing , further simulations and comparisons to observations are needed to confirm the validity of the knp09 scenario .",
    "an alternative possibility to avoid ejecting the stellar remnant of the satellite is if it was accreted by the host galaxy as part of a larger group of satellites .",
    "many of the milky way s brightest satellites appear to lie in a disk , as would naturally occur if these satellites were initially members of a group that was subsequently tidally disrupted in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "lake and donghia @xcite specifically proposed that the magellanic clouds formed the core of such a group that also included seven other milky way satellite galaxies including the sgr dwarf .",
    "however , others have argued that this hypothesized group would have to be more tightly bound than observed dwarf - galaxy associations , and that independent accretion from a common filamentary structure could also explain the observed disk of satellites @xcite .",
    "if the sgr dwarf was accreted as the more massive member of a satellite - galaxy binary , it could lose energy to its lighter companion as the binary was tidally disrupted in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "such a `` cosmic mnage  trois '' might conceivably leave the sgr dwarf with a small enough orbital energy that its stellar remnant might remain bound to the milky way despite the additional acceleration due to @xmath29 dm forces .",
    "knp09 performed a series of simulations that suggested that the symmetric tidal streams of the sgr dwarf galaxy might be consistent with dm forces comparable in strength to gravity , in contradiction with the claims of kk06 .",
    "these simulations used static potentials for the galactic bulge , disk , and dm halo .",
    "such static potentials save computational resources and avoid artificial heating of the tidal streams , making them essential to attempts like those in @xcite to compare the observed and simulated velocity dispersions in the tidal streams .",
    "however , static potentials do not allow for dynamical friction and therefore the satellite galaxy must begin on its current orbit to reproduce the observed tidal streams .",
    "such a cheat was acceptable in @xcite and kk06 , but fails in the scenario of knp09 where the segregation of stars and dm should occur on the satellite s _ first _ approach within a distance @xmath102 of the host galaxy .",
    "this first approach will likely occur on a very different orbit from the current one with apocentric distance @xmath173 kpc needed to produce the observed sgr tidal streams .",
    "the initial conditions used in the first series of simulations in knp09 , with the satellite stars and dm coincident at @xmath174 with the same velocity , actually correspond to already unbound stellar and dm distributions moving on widely separated orbits in the galactic halo that happened to converge at @xmath175 when the simulations begin .",
    "we have considered the first approach of a satellite galaxy to the galactic center in the presence of large dm forces , and have identified three preconditions for the creation of a purely stellar satellite that can go on to form symmetric tidal streams :    1 .",
    "the dm force must be strong enough that differential acceleration in the galactic halo fully segregates the stars and dm prior to the formation of the stellar tidal streams .",
    "the stellar density in the satellite core must be high enough for it to remain a bound object after being pulled free from its dm halo .",
    "3 .   the dm force must not accelerate the satellite beyond the gravitational escape velocity of the host galaxy before the satellite stars are pulled from their dm halo .",
    "the extremely large mass - to - light ratios observed even in the cores of milky way satellites are difficult to reconcile with condition 2 , and such efficient star formation contradicts our theoretical understanding of the vulnerability of these satellites to reionization and stellar feedback .",
    "dm forces strong enough to satisfy condition 1 are likely to be too strong to satisfy condition 3 unless a further epicycle is added to give the sgr dwarf an initial orbital energy much less than that expected for a newly accreted satellite galaxy . while the scenario proposed in knp09 for symmetric sgr tidal streams is perhaps possible for certain initial orbits and galactic models , it requires that several restrictive assumptions be satisfied .",
    "further simulations are needed that self - consistently capture both the segregation of stars and dm and the subsequent development of tidal streams .",
    "future observations of other milky way satellites will also severely constrain the existence of @xmath27 dm forces . once their proper motions have been measured ,",
    "the pericenters of their orbits can be determined .",
    "if these pericenters are too close to the galactic center , the dm forces they will experience during pericentric passages will be inconsistent with retaining their dm halos in seeming contradiction to the high observed mass - to - light ratios .",
    "more sophisticated simulations and observations by upcoming astrometry missions like sim lite thus provide a clear path towards closing remaining loopholes in constraints on dm forces .",
