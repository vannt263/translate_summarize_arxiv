    "in @xcite , dawson and perkins introduced a population dynamic model of two populations that live on a countable site space @xmath2 .",
    "the individuals migrate between sites and , at any given site , perform a critical branching process with a branching rate proportional to the local size of the population of the respective other type .",
    "more precisely , dawson and perkins considered the system of coupled stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) ( taking nonnegative values ) @xmath3    here , @xmath4 is the @xmath5-matrix of a markov chain on @xmath2 with symmetric jump kernel @xmath6 , @xmath7 is an independent family of brownian motions and @xmath8 is a parameter .",
    "dawson and perkins showed that there exists a unique weak solution of this sde taking values in a suitable subspace of @xmath9 with some growth condition .",
    "furthermore , this process is a strong markov process .",
    "while existence of a weak solution is rather standard due to the procedure proposed by shiga and shimizu  @xcite , weak uniqueness was shown using a certain self - duality of the process established in @xcite .",
    "we will describe the duality in detail below , in ( [ e2.4 ] ) .",
    "a main result of dawson and perkins is a dichotomy in the long - time behavior of the solutions depending on whether @xmath10 is recurrent or transient ( assuming some mild regularity condition on @xmath11 ) . for recurrent @xmath10 ( fulfilling the regularity assumption ) ,",
    "the types segregate , while for transient @xmath10 , there is coexistence of types .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath12 denote the total mass processes ( @xmath13 ) and assume that @xmath14 .",

    ", the distribution of @xmath36 converges weakly to @xmath37 , that is , to a spatially homogeneous point @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is sampled according to the distribution @xmath23 .",
    "hence , in the recurrent case , the two types segregate locally and form clusters . the assumption that the initial point is constant can be weakened to an ergodic random initial condition ( see @xcite ) .    the starting point for this work",
    "was the wish to obtain a quantitative description of the cluster growth in the recurrent case .",
    "we will only briefly describe the heuristics .",
    "dawson and perkins also constructed a version of their process in continuous space @xmath40 instead of @xmath2 as the solution of a stochastic partial differential equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent space ",
    "time white noises and @xmath44 is the laplace operator . as @xmath44 on @xmath45 is recurrent , types also segregate here .",
    "now , due to brownian scaling , if we denote by @xmath46 the solution of ( [ e1.3 ] ) with that given value of @xmath0 , then we obtain @xmath47 = \\mathbf{p}_{\\underline x } [ ( y^{\\gamma t}_1(r ) ) _ { r\\in { \\mathbb{r}}}\\in \\bolds{\\cdot } ] .\\ ] ] equation ( [ e1.4 ] ) shows that clusters of @xmath48 grow like @xmath49 and that a better understanding of the precise cluster formation can be obtained by letting @xmath1 for fixed time .",
    "hence , we aim to construct a model @xmath50 , that is , in some sense , the limit of @xmath51 as @xmath1 .    in this paper , we construct @xmath50 in the simple case where @xmath2 is a singleton and where the migration between colonies is replaced by an interaction with a time - invariant mean field .",
    "this is a first step toward the investigation of the model involving infinitely many sites .",
    "we give characterizations of the process @xmath50 via an infinitesimal generator , as the solution of a well - posed martingale problem and as the limit of @xmath46 as @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we give a strong construction of the process via a time - changed planar brownian motion .",
    "this will also serve to derive path properties .    in two forthcoming papers ,",
    "we construct the infinite rate process on a countable site space @xmath2 via a stochastic differential equation with jump - type noise and give a characterization via a martingale problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will investigate the long - time behaviour and give conditions for segregation and for coexistence of types @xcite .",
    "an alternative construction via a trotter product approach is carried out in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we will , in fact , be able to describe this infinitesimal dynamics both in terms of a martingale problem and in terms of a generator of markov transition kernels .",
