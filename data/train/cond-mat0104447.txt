    "the ground state of the quasi - two dimensional organic conductor   has emerged as one of the more important fundamental problems in the area of synthetic metals .",
    "this is due to the highly unusual magnetic field dependent behavior of the low temperature ground state which appears below a transition temperature @xmath5 = 8 k. the band calculation and the fermi surface study@xcite suggest a two dimensional fermi surface consisting of a quasi - one dimensional electron section and a closed hole pocket as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the density wave formation is believed to originate from the instability of the open orbit at low temperatures , which is followed by fermi surface reconstruction@xcite .",
    "this in turn leads to the unusual behavior of this compound at low temperatures and high magnetic field@xcite .",
    "this ground state is now thought to be related to a charge density wave state where both spin and orbital mechanisms compete , as evidenced by recent studies in tilted magnetic fields@xcite . above 22.5 t an anomaly ( called the `` kink field '' or @xmath6 after its discovery by osada et al .",
    ", @xcite which appears in various transport - related measurements ) occurs , and a new high field electronic state emerges .",
    "recently the observation of critical state - like behavior in the magnetization@xcite and susceptibility @xcite above @xmath6 has been reported , which indicates an unusual , highly conductive state which is associated with the landau level filling fraction .",
    "additional thermodynamic evidence for unusual , hysteretic behavior above @xmath6 , which is related to the landau level filling , has also been reported in high field magnetocaloric measurements @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work has been to probe this novel ground state by thermoelectric power ( tep ) , which involves measuring the potential difference across a sample in the presence of a thermal gradient , as shown in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "in general , the resulting signal ( in v / k ) has the form@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density of the states , @xmath9 is an average charge velocity , and @xmath10 is the carrier scattering relaxation time .",
    "in addition , we have also measured the nernst effect for specific sample configurations .",
    "this involves the transverse thermopower which is given in the simple approximation by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the nernst coefficient , @xmath13 is the magnetic field , and @xmath14 is the ratio of the distance between the nernst leads and the sample thickness .",
    "we note that ideally , for closed orbits , @xmath15 is not sensitive to electron / hole compensation effects , and that it increases linearly with magnetic field .",
    "( see discussion below ) .",
    "clearly the tep and nernst signals can be a complex mixture of phenomena which can be difficult to interpret , unless specific aspects of the system under consideration dominate and/or change dramatically@xcite .",
    "examples include the case of a conventional metal ( @xmath16 ) , a superconductor ( @xmath17 ) , and the quantum hall effect ( @xmath18 0 or a finite value depending on the landau level filling ) .",
    "as we will show in the present case , the tep probe for   is particularly sensitive to the landau level spectrum , to the gap in the electronic structure , and to the in - plane electronic anisotropy .    in light of the discussion above , we state here",
    "the main findings of the present work before the full presentation . , where comparisons can be made with previous studies ( all of which are in - plane , and almost exclusively at low or zero magnetic fields ) , we find that our results agree in the details of the sensitivity of the thermopower to the anisotropic fermi surface topology , and with absolute value of the thermopower signals previously reported .",
    "in addition , we extend these measurements below @xmath5 , where the tep reveals details of the transition into the density wave state . , we observe , in the oscillatory metp , quantum oscillations associated with the main closed fermi surface orbit frequency , and also oscillations associated with fermi surface reconstruction and anomalous second harmonic signals which result from the density wave ground state .",
    "we believe that this is the first detailed study of quantum oscillations in a quasi - two dimensional organic conductor by thermopower methods . , the background ( non - oscillatory ) metp is sensitive to changes in the density wave ground state with magnetic field .",
    "this includes the signatures for three changes in the fermi surface topology , one near 3.75 t , a second above 10 t , and a third above 22.5 t. the first two are associated with magnetic breakdown effects , and the latter is the first order phase transition to the high field state .",
    "the temperature - magnetic field phase diagram , based on the metp results , is presented .",
    ", we study in detail for the first time the inter - plane thermopower , which gives additional information about the role of the inter - plane transport mechanism of this material .",
    ", in the high field state , we describe the phase relationship between the nernst signal and the metp signal , which is consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "to our knowledge , no thermopower measurements have been carried out on the   material in very high magnetic fields . in 1950",
    "s , a series of calculations were done for high field dependence of magnetotransport properties .",
    "it was found that , in the limit of @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath21 is the scattering time ) , asymptotic magnetotranport properties ( electrical conductivity@xcite , thermal conductivity@xcite and thermopower@xcite ) are highly dependent on the fermi surface topology and carrier compensation , while they weakly depend on the scattering time and the energy dispersion relations .",
    "it was therefore suggested that those measurements would be useful to reveal the fermi surface topologies .    due to the complex nature of thermopower signals in anisotropic materials , it is useful to briefly consider previous studies in organic materials , including those at high magnetic fields where field induced phase transitions occur . for consistency in the anisotropic thermopower parameters reported below , we use the following notation : the measured values can be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 , signify that the heat current is applied along a geometrical direction @xmath26 and the thermal emf is measured along a direction @xmath27 , and @xmath0 is one of the crystallographic axes along which the heat current is applied .",
    "for zero magnetic field , @xmath22 can be written in the reduced form such as @xmath28 , or simply @xmath29 .",

    "this assignment is supported by a simulation of the thermopower , based on boltzmann transport theory , with the bandwidth parameters as input@xcite .",
    "another experiment involving in - plane thermopower has been performed on the 10.4 k organic superconductor@xcite @xmath32 - ( bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br ( see also gartner et al .",
    "@xcite and buravov et al .",
    "this system also has open and closed orbit fermi surface bands , and again , the sign of the tep in the normal state above @xmath34 follows the general rule that it is positive when the thermal gradient is parallel to the electron sheets , and negative when perpendicular .",
    "below @xmath34 , the tep vanished , as expected for a superconductor in zero magnetic field .    in studies of quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) systems based on the tcnq charge transfer salts @xcite and the perylene based compounds@xcite ,",
    "various features of tep were exhibited .",
    "depending on the species of cations and the temperature range , they show linear temperature dependence , 1/@xmath35 behavior , or temperature independence .",

    "a fisdw transition occurs from a q1d metallic state to a sequence of sdw states .",
    "both the mtep and nernst signals , which bear some relation to the corresponding transport measurements ( i.e. longitudinal resistivity @xmath47 and the hall effect @xmath48 respectively ) , are sensitive to these transitions .",
    "as the final fisdw sub - phase is entered at constant field with lower temperatures , the thermopower first rises with an activated ( gap - like ) behavior , followed by a decrease at lower temperatures deeper in the sdw phase .",

    "notably , quantum oscillations ( the so - called `` rapid oscillations '' which are periodic in inverse field ) are observed in the thermopower for both materials .",

    "the negative ( positive ) sign of thermopower along the @xmath59-axis indicates that the fermi surface is electron ( hole)-like along the @xmath59-axis , which corresponds to the fermi surface as shown in fig . 1 : here , for a thermal gradient along the @xmath41-axis direction , the hole pockets should contribute , whereas for the @xmath50-axis direction , the electron - like open orbits should contribute as well .",
    "we note however , that the temperature dependence of the tep shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is non - monotonic .",
    "there is a minimum in @xmath60 and @xmath61 around t = 120 to 150 k .this behavior can be explained by applying the two - dimensional tight binding parameters for this material to the boltzmann transport equation@xcite,@xcite .",

    "ii above , as has the peak in @xmath60 near 25 k .",
    "the peak in @xmath60 may arise from the energy - dependent scattering term of eq .",

    "the tep associated with phonon drag results from the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the temperature dependence changes from a @xmath63 to a @xmath64 behavior @xcite with increasing temperature .",
    "especially , peak structures at low temperature ( typically between @xmath65/10 and @xmath65/5 , where @xmath65 is the debye temperature ) are usually attributed to the phonon drag effect , whose temperature dependence in noble metals is quite similar to that of @xmath60 .",
    "thermopower measurements on the other members of this compound ( @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1mhg(scn)@xmath2 , where m = tl , rb , nh@xmath2 ) also showed peak structures at lower temperatures ( 15 @xmath66 k ) , which were attributed to the phonon drag effect@xcite . of note",

    "when the heat current is applied perpendicular to the most conducting planes , the 2d band model will not be appropriate without considering the energy dispersion between conducting planes .",
    "since simple mixing of two contributions of @xmath61 and @xmath60 can not produce temperature dependence and magnitude of @xmath62 , it is necessary to find a proper model for inter - plane transport .",
    "a straight - forward application of the @xmath69 relationship produces unrealistic values of the @xmath51-axis bandwidth ( of order 250 mev ) , which is known from fermiology studies to be at least 100 times smaller . at present",
    "there is no satisfactory treatment of either the magnetoresistance or the thermopower for the @xmath51-axis transport behavior .",
    "the behavior of the thermopower through the density wave transition ( @xmath5= 8 k ) has also not been previously reported . from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , jumps of thermopower for @xmath61 and @xmath60 are observed near the metal - density wave transition temperature ( @xmath5 ) . in the resistance measurements , the change of slope near",
    "@xmath5 may be attributed to the vanishing conductivity of the open orbit band ( @xmath70 ) in parallel with the remaining finite conductivity of closed orbit band ( @xmath71)@xcite .",
    "in addition , for thermopower measurements , metallic carriers give a linear @xmath35-dependence while activation over a band gap gives a 1/@xmath35 dependence .",
    "therefore for one type of carrier ( either from open orbit or closed orbit ) exclusively , @xmath61 will diverge below @xmath5 .",
    "experimentally , there is always the possibility of random diffusion of heat along the sample due to misalignment between heat currents and crystal axes , and also , the total thermopower may involve a mixing of contributions from several bands ( especially below @xmath5 where the fermi surface is reconstructed ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that dominant behavior of thermopower in the present case reflects the influence of the heat currents with respect to the topology and orientation of the specific orbits .",
    "when two types of carriers are involved , the total thermopower can be written as@xcite , @xmath72 above @xmath5 , both orbits have metallic conductivity and thermopower ; hence the total thermopower shows a linear temperature dependence . but below @xmath5 , a band gap opens for @xmath73 band , therefore @xmath70 goes to zero exponentially as the temperature decreases , and @xmath74 diverges as 1/@xmath35 .",
    "however , below this temperature , a modified closed orbit band remains , which still gives a metallic thermopower contribution .",
    "consequently , just below the transition temperature , there will be a jump of thermopower , @xmath75 , from the divergence of @xmath74 , but this contribution quickly disappears as @xmath70 goes to zero .",
    "we may further compare the magnitude of jump of thermopower ( @xmath75 ) and that of electronic heat capacity ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "since thermopower measures heat carried by a carrier divided by the carrier charge and temperature , @xmath75 equals @xmath76/@xmath77 . adding both contributions from @xmath61 and @xmath60 , @xmath75 is about 1 @xmath78v / k , which corresponds to @xmath79 @xmath80 j/ k@xmath81carrier .",
    "the reported @xmath76 is about 0.1 j / mol@xmath81k@xcite and 0.25 j / mol@xmath81k@xcite , which are in fair agreement with @xmath75 .",
    "a corresponding change in @xmath82 at @xmath5 is unclear , if it exists at all ( in fig .",
    "this indicates that the phase transition around @xmath5 = 8 k occurs predominantly within the in - plane electronic structure .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the magnetic field dependence of the tep ( i.e. mtep ) for all three crystallographic directions at different , fixed temperatures . to show the field dependence more clearly , some traces are offset from zero as indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "the mtep signal contains two components , the background mtep which is sensitive to the fermi surface topology , and the oscillatory mtep which is a manifestation of the landau quantization of the closed orbit fermi surface . to separate the two signals , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the background mtep data where the oscillatory mtep has been removed by filtering the total mtep signal .",

    "the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath51-axis , perpendicular to the @xmath83 conducting plane .",
    "a similarity between the magnetic field dependence of the thermopower and the resistance can be expected from the boltzmann transport equations .",
    "indeed we find that the general field - dependence of the mtep is similar in some respects to that of the magnetoresistance@xcite : ( 1 ) below @xmath5 , the in - plane mtep shows a broad peak at @xmath84 10 t. ( 2 ) above the `` kink field '' @xmath6 at 22.5 t , the field dependence is weak .",
    "( 3 ) quantum oscillations are observed in the mtep signal associated with the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) and shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effects ( i.e. , from eqn .",

    "in particular , the oscillation frequency obtained from the fast fourier transform ( fft ) analysis of @xmath85 and @xmath92 at 0.7 k ( see fig . [ fig8 ] ) is about 667 t , which agrees with results obtained from other measurements@xcite .",
    "this comparison also includes the observation of higher harmonics of the fundamental @xmath0 orbit , and even the @xmath117 orbit ( 180 t ) which is expected to be a manifestation of the magnetic breakdown topology below @xmath6 .",
    "( see for instance uji et al.@xcite ) .",
    "an important feature of our results , most evident above @xmath6 , is a phase difference between the metp and nernst quantum oscillations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for two different cases , the @xmath50- , and @xmath41-axes . indeed , zilberman",
    "s model@xcite predicts a phase difference of @xmath56 between the mtep and nernst oscillations .",
    "we show this more explicitly for @xmath85 and@xmath92 at @xmath35=0.7 k in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , with the angle ( @xmath123 ) defined as the ratio of the electric fields due to transverse and longitudinal thermopower ( @xmath123=arctan ( @xmath124)= arctan(@xmath125 ) .",
    "the phase difference is @xmath56 , which supports zilberman s model@xcite .",
    "zilberman s model also predicts similar field and temperature dependence of oscillation amplitude with that of the lifschitz - kosevich formula for de haas - van alphen oscillations .",
    "the amplitude of thermopower oscillation increases when @xmath126 , but it is almost field independent above @xmath6 .",
    "we note that in this range of temperature , the quantum oscillation amplitude is complicated due to the anomalous high field state , where the dhva and sdh behave in a significantly different manner , and a comparison based on standard lk theory is not applicable",
    ". a more systematic study of the mtep and nernst effects above @xmath6 vs temperature , and also vs. field orientation , will be necessary to provide a complete picture .",
    "we have applied the method of magnetothermopower to investigate the low temperature , magnetic field dependent phase of the anisotropic organic conductor .",
    "our results show that the sensitivity of thermopower to anisotropic fermi surface topologies may be extended to the study of systems where temperature and magnetic field alter these topologies .",
    "the most significant results of the present investigation include the determination of the low temperature phase diagram of , based purely on thermopower measurements , the study of the onset of magnetic breakdown effects via the magnetothermopower , and the measurement of quantum oscillations in the magnetothermopower and nernst effect , which are in accord with theoretical expectations .",
