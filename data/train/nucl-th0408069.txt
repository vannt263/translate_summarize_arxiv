    "it is well known that the relativistic field theory based on the hadrons referred to as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) has been of great success in describing the ground states of finite nuclei@xcite .",
    "when the energy functional of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) is fitted to nuclear saturation , the rmf model automatically produces an appropriate order of the spin - orbit splitting of nuclei , the spin - observables of the proton - nucleus scattering and energy dependence of the proton - nucleus optical potential . in rmf , however , only positive - energy nucleons are taken into account in the calculation in spite of the existence of solutions with negative energy , which is one of the interesting characters of the relativistic picture .",
    "the negative - energy states are observables in antinucleonic atom .",
    "the bound levels of antinucleonic atom are predicted to be much deeper than those of ordinary nucleon since the magnitudes of nucleon - scalar and -vector self energies , which are very large , cancel each other to provide the usual binding energy in the nucleon sector , while they add each other in the antinucleon sector ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is important to study if this feature remains to be the case , when we treat the negative - energy states explicitly in the qhd framework . in particular , to know how deep the antinucleons are bound in the nucleus provides valuable information for the search of the exotic collective antimatter production proposed by greiner@xcite .",
    "recently , the gauge invariant nuclear - polarization calculation was carried out in the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rrpa ) based on the rmf theory .",
    "it was found that the rrpa eigenstates with negative energy have a significant role because the transverse form factors to these states become considerably large@xcite .",
    "if antinucleons are deeply bound , the transverse response function has a contribution from the antinucleon states with lower energy than twice the nucleon mass .",
    "then , electron - scattering or photo - absorption may confirm the large binding of antinucleon . in order to investigate the antinucleon state in the qhd model ,",
    "however , it is required to take into account the effect of vacuum polarization of nucleon - antinucleon field to the mean field because of consistency .",
    "namely , the rmf model without the vacuum contribution has to be extended to the full one - nucleon - loop approximation , which we refer to as the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) .",
    "the vacuum contributions and their effects on the bound states of positive energy were investigated by several authors within the local - density approximation and the derivative - expansion method @xcite .",
    "after refitting the parameters of the model to the properties of spherical nuclei , it was found that the rha calculation can reproduce the experimental data of the binding energies and the rms radii of nuclei as well as the rmf can . on the other hand , due to the decrease of the scalar and vector potentials by the feedback from the vacuum in the rha calculation ,",
    "the effective mass of nucleon becomes large and the binding energy of antinucleon becomes small compared with the rmf .    despite the finding of the importance of the vacuum effect",
    ", however , the exact evaluation of one - loop corrections in a finite nuclear system has never been performed .",
    "this is an exceedingly difficult task , since the exact treatment of vacuum polarization in finite nuclei requires the computation of not only the valence nucleon with positive energy but also infinite number of the negative - energy states . in this context",
    ", there is an excellent method developed in the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite ; the summation of the eigenstates is replaced by the energy integral of the dirac green function along the imaginary axis in which the green functions do not oscillate and therefore , it is possible to calculate it much faster .",
    "blunden carried out the exact rha calculation of qhd with 1 + 1 dimensions and the calculation of quantum solitons model with 3 + 1 dimensions@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will apply this method developed in atomic physics to the rha calculation of qhd .",

    "iv , the numerical results of the rha calculation including vacuum corrections for baryon and scalar densities are presented for @xmath1o and @xmath2ca and the role of vacuum in the properties of nucleus is discussed . in sec .",
    "v , we will also compare our rigorous method with the local - density approximation and the derivative expansion .",
    "finally we give summary of the present calculation in sec .  vi .",
    "the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons which interact in a relativistic covariant manner through the exchange of several mesons ; scalar meson ( @xmath3 ) produces a strong attraction while isoscalar vector meson ( @xmath4 ) produces a strong repulsion for the nucleon sector . in the present work ,",
    "we employ the lagrangian density including photon ( @xmath5 ) as well as @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes counterterms to renormalize the nucleon density which has the divergence from the vacuum .",
    "since this lagrangian density includes the nonlinear coupling terms for @xmath3 meson , the one-@xmath3-meson loop also can contribute to the nucleon density@xcite . in the present paper , however , we neglect this contribution for simplification .",
    "assuming that the nuclear ground state is spherically symmetric , the hartree basis consists of eigenfunctions of the following dirac equation ; @xmath8\\psi_n(\\vec{r})=0 . \\label{dirac}\\ ] ] the meson fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy the klein - gordon equations ,    @xmath11    respectively .",

    "although the second terms of right - hand side of ( [ rhow ] ) and ( [ rhos ] ) have divergence , an expansion of the total vacuum correction in the coupling constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 of meson fields verifies that all divergences are contained in the first order of @xmath20 for baryon density , and are contained up to the third order of @xmath21 for scalar density . in the following subsections ,",

    "@xcite , where a tensor - coupling of @xmath4 meson is introduced in order to provide the spin - orbit splittings .",
    "however , the omega meson coupling with the nucleon is known to be dominated by the vector coupling in the nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "another candidate to solve this problem may be the possibility of the finite pion mean field in the relativistic hartree framework , which was suggested to provide the spin up and spin down partners to have large energy separations@xcite .",

    "the both of scalar and baryon density - profiles obtained by the present calculation are in a surprisingly good agreement with those of the derivative expansion",
    ".    however , this can not be always the case@xcite and it is possible to attribute the excellent agreement between our method and the leading - order derivative expansion to the character of @xmath0 model .",

    "we have obtained numerical results that the vacuum corrections for baryon and scalar densities are non - negligible in the rha calculation . in particular , we have seen that the vector and scalar potentials in the rha are largely suppressed by the feedback of the vacuum polarization to the mean fields .",
    "such suppressed potentials of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 fields affect the theoretical calculations for binding energies of antinucleon and the various sum rules .",
    "our results with the walecka model have reproduced the experimental binding energies and rms radii of @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nicely after adjusting the parameters .",
    "however , it was impossible to find a qhd parameter set to reproduce spin - orbit splittings in accordance with the observed data and required by nuclear shell model . in the @xmath0 model ,",
    "the main attraction is caused by the large @xmath3 mean field , which provides small nucleon effective mass in the finite nuclei .",
    "however , the negative - energy nucleons do not like to change its mass from the free value .",
    "hence , the negative - energy nucleons try to keep the nucleon mass at the free value . for the net effect ,",
    "the effective nucleon mass remains to be quite large .",
    "once the effective nucleon mass becomes large , the spin - orbit splittings in the single particle spectra come out to be very small .",
    "the qhd type effective theory based on the @xmath0 mesons need to include new type of interaction terms and/or to go beyond the rha approximation to solve this problem .",
    "we have found that our result of rha calculation is very similar to that in refs .",
    "@xcite where the derivative - expansion method was used to estimate the vacuum polarization . in particular , it has been shown that the agreement of density - profiles of the vacuum correction is quite good .",
    "thus , the validity of this approximation has been confirmed by the present calculation .    this work has been supported by matsuo foundation , suginami , tokyo .",
