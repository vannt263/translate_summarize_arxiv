    "while originally observed in optics , a similar diffraction limit occurs for acoustic waves .",
    "various mechanisms have been pursued over the years to sidestep this limitation , through either signal processing mechanisms or near - field imaging techniques to enhance the resolution .",
    "one of the most promising advances in recent years has been in the use of acoustic metamaterials , which has enabled the realization of exotic macroscopic effective properties , including negative mass density , negative bulk modulus and negative phase speed @xcite . with effective material properties that are double - negative ( superlens ) or possess hyperbolic dispersion ( hyperlens ) , acoustic metamaterials create negative refraction , enabling amplification of evanescent waves and subdiffraction - limit focusing @xcite .",
    "however , such techniques require a negative refraction lens in the near - field , to either amplify the evanescent wave or convert it to a propagating wave .",
    "alternatively , helicoidal ( vortex ) waves can provide a method for creating stable propagating vortices well into the far - field and the creation of features smaller than the resolution limit without the need for an additional near - field focusing aperture . while previous success has been achieved with superresolved optical microscopy@xcite , this potential for superresolution using acoustic vortex waves",
    "has thus far not been realized . in this paper",

    "this has enabled the creation of arbitrarily shaped non - axisymmetric optical structures with sharp features , including corners , triangles , and multi - point stars @xcite .",
    "acoustic vortex waves , like their optical counterpart , also carry orbital angular momentum , but do not exhibit spin angular momentum due to the scalar nature of longitudinal acoustic waves @xcite . while comprising a somewhat less extensive body of work ,",
    "there has also been sustained interest in acoustic vortex waves , focused on particle manipulation , acoustic communications and precision alignment of acoustic systems .",
    "acoustic vortex waves have previously been generated with either single - mode resonators @xcite , or more often using a phased array , which enables a wide range of topological modes to be realized with a single aperture @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper , we demonstrate far - field acoustic superresolution using shaped acoustic vortices . compared with previously proposed near - field methods of acoustic superresolution , in this work we describe how far - field superresolution can be obtained using an acoustic vortex wave antenna . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by leveraging the recent advances in optical vortices in conjunction with the topological diversity of a leaky wave antenna design . in particular , the use of an acoustic vortex wave antenna eliminates the need for a complicated phased array consisting of multiple active elements , and enables a superresolving aperture to be achieved with a single simple acoustic source and total aperture size less than a wavelength in diameter . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical formulation is presented for the design of an acoustic vortex wave antenna with arbitrary planar arrangement , and explicit expressions are developed for the radiated acoustic pressure field . </S>",
    "<S> this geometric versatility enables variously - shaped acoustic vortex patterns to be achieved , which propagate from the near - field into the far - field through an arrangement of stable integer mode vortices . </S>",
    "<S> two examples are presented and discussed in detail , illustrating the generation and transmission of an  x \" and  y \" shape into the far - field . despite the total aperture size being less than a wavelength in diameter </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed acoustic vortex wave antenna is shown to achieve far - field superresolution with feature sizes 4 - 9 times smaller than the resolution limit . </S>"
