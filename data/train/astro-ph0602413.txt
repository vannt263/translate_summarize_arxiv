    "the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been measured with high signal to noise on scales from degrees to several arcminutes ( e.g. , hinshaw et al .  2003 , kuo et al .  2004 , mason et al .",
    "however , observations of cmb anisotropy on arcminute scales , where secondary anisotropies such as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) are expected to dominate the primary cmb anisotropy ( e.g. , gnedin & jaffe 2001 ) , have not yet achieved comparable precision . at these finer angular scales , observations",
    "distant sz clusters have the potential to be a powerful probe of the growth of structure in the universe ( carlstrom , holder , & reese 2002 ) .",
    "however , the power spectrum of the arcminute fluctuations reveals little information about the nature of the sources responsible for the anisotropy . as suggested by rubino - martin & sunyaev ( 2003 ) , higher order statistics of images can , in principle , be used to identify the unique signature of the sz effect .",
    "beginning in the summer of 1998 , we began a program to search for arcminute - scale cmb anisotropy using the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometer .",

    "the bima anisotropy survey consists of 18 fields that had not been previously observed for sz galaxy clusters or cmb anisotropy at arcminute angular scales . each field",
    "was observed with the bima array at a frequency of @xmath14 ghz and the vla at a frequency of @xmath15 ghz .",
    "analysis of ten fields observed with the bima array during the summers of 1998 , 2000 , and 2001 revealed evidence for a detection of power in excess of the instrument noise . a description of the analysis and results for the first ten fields in the survey can be found in d2002 .",
    "eight new fields were added to the survey in the summer of 2002 .",
    "all anisotropy observations were made using the bima array at hat creek .",
    "nine @xmath16 meter telescopes of the array were equipped for operation at @xmath14 ghz , providing a @xmath17 fwhm field of view .",
    "the first ten fields , bdf4-bdf13 , were chosen to lie in regions expected to have minimal radio point source and dust contamination .",
    "the eight fields added in 2002 , bdf14-bdf21 , were chosen to lie two minutes east in right ascension of existing fields in the survey .",
    "observations of these fields added another 489 hours of observations to the previously published data , for a total of 1096 hours for the complete bima survey .",
    "each of these new fields was observed using the same phase calibrator as its previously observed nearest neighbor and analyzed following the data reduction as described in d2002 .",
    "these fields were chosen to check for possible contamination of the signal correlated with telescope position .",
    "this makes for a total of 18 independent fields in the survey , covering approximately @xmath18 square degrees .",
    "the pointing center , dates of observation , and observation time for each of the fields are given in table [ tab : obstimes ] .",
    "we dedicated @xmath19 hours of observation with the bima array to each of the new fields in order to achieve a uniform rms noise level of @xmath20jy / beam on short baselines ( @xmath21-@xmath22 ) for the entire sample .",
    "this noise level corresponds to an rms of @xmath23k for a @xmath1 synthesized beam .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as was described in the introduction , the most likely astrophysical source of the excess power observed in the survey is expected to be cmb anisotropy arising from the sz effect in clusters of galaxies .",
    "assuming that the observed excess power is entirely due to the sz effect , we use a publicly available archive of n - body simulations ( schulz & white , 2003 ) to add the expected signal from the sz effect to monte carlo noise realizations .",
    "these simulations predict the evolution of mass from @xmath25 to present in a cosmological model described by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . only dark matter is included in these simulations , and the baryons contributing to the sz signal are added assuming that the gas closely traces the dark matter .",
    "independent regions of the n - body simulations are multiplied by the @xmath17 fwhm primary beam and transformed into the @xmath21-@xmath32 plane with the same @xmath21-@xmath32 sampling as the real bima data .",
    "noise is added to each @xmath21-@xmath32 point with a variance determined from the observed visibilities .",
    "therefore , each simulated observation has @xmath21-@xmath32 coverage and noise characteristics identical to the real bima observation of each field .",
    "the analysis of one hundred realizations of the bima survey with unique instrumental noise and simulated sz sky resulted in an excess power of @xmath33k@xmath5 at @xmath6 confidence ; this is remarkably close to the level of excess power found in the bima survey .",
    "komatsu and seljak ( 2002 ) demonstrate that the amplitude of the sz power spectrum has a strong dependence on @xmath24 , with @xmath34 for @xmath24 near unity .",
    "we scale the simulated sz images by @xmath35 to produce skies corresponding to different values of @xmath24 .",
    "these images are transformed to the @xmath36 plane , combined with the simulated instrumental noise , and used to compute the likelihood of each value of @xmath24 resulting in the observed excess power , which we approximate as @xmath37k@xmath5 .",
    "the relative likelihood that simulations with a given value of @xmath24 will reproduce the observed excess power is determined from 10,000 realizations of the bima survey with @xmath24 ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 the resulting relative likelihood shown in figure  [ fig : sig8_like ] includes contributions to the uncertainty from both noise in the measurement and sample variance due the non gaussian nature of the sz signal and the small patch of sky surveyed . assuming an additional @xmath40 uncertainty in the simulations ( komatsu & seljak , 2002 , goldstein et al .  , 2003 )",
    ", we find @xmath13 at @xmath6 confidence and @xmath41 at @xmath12 confidence .",
    "analysis of the complete bima survey results in a detection of excess power with nearly @xmath12 confidence . however , with the power spectrum analysis , we are unable to determine if the excess power is caused by sources with negative flux as would be expected from the sz effect in galaxy clusters at 30 ghz",

    "we compute asymmetry , skewness , and extrema in the observed data set .",
    "these results are compared to both simulations of instrumental noise and to simulations of sz galaxy clusters added to instrumental noise in order to determine the significance of the observed distribution of flux .",
    "the fourier transform of the visibilities measured by the interferometer into the image plane introduces correlations between pixels which complicate the noise properties . in order to better understand this",
    ", we generated monte carlo simulations of the visibility data and transformed them into images .",
    "we created two sets of simulations , each containing 100 realizations of the full set of 18 images .",
    "these simulations are used to quantify the significance of applying the statistical tests to the bima images .",
    "the first set of simulations uses random complex visibilities with variances consistent with the observed noise for each image . at each point in @xmath21-@xmath32 space in the observed data , a simulated visibility is created with a real and imaginary component from a random sampling of a gaussian distribution with variance determined from the weight of that visibility .",
    "therefore , each simulated observation has @xmath21-@xmath32 coverage and noise characteristics identical to the real bima observation of each field .    in the second case , we add the expected contribution from the sz sky to the mc noise realizations using the same simulated sz sky images described in section  [ subsec : sig8 ] with @xmath24 fixed to @xmath99 .",
    "independent regions of the n - body simulations are attenuated with the @xmath17 fwhm primary beam and transformed into the @xmath21-@xmath32 plane using the exact same @xmath21-@xmath32 sampling as that in the real bima data .",
    "noise is then added to the visibility data in the same way as for the noise - only simulations and the data is then transformed into the image plane for analysis .",

    ", one can produce a probability distribution for each observable statistic .",
    "the most likely value and integrated confidence intervals can be taken from this distribution and compared to the results of the real observations . due to the modest number of 100 simulations of the survey , the shape of the pixel distribution is strongly dependent on bin size and bin spacing , leaving the most likely value as a poorly determined quantity . instead",
    ", the median value in the 100 simulations is taken to be the most likely estimate .",
    "the terms defining the @xmath101th and @xmath102th percentile in the distribution are taken to be the lower and upper bounds to the @xmath6 confidence intervals , respectively .",
    "the 4 nearest neighbors to the median , lower bound , and upper bound in the distribution are averaged to reduce the noise in the estimates .",
    "we use a histogram of pixels binned in intervals of significance , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the value at pixel i and @xmath105 is the estimated image rms ( approximately @xmath106jy / beam ) .",
    "this is equivalent to weighting the pixels by the sensitivity of the observation .",
    "we can compare the pixel distributions for observed data and simulations by comparing the histogram of the images as shown in figure [ fig : distribution_survey ] .",
    "for a given image , we can characterize the pixel flux distribution by selecting a flux interval @xmath107 , and computing a histogram of the number of pixels with a flux between @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "the asymmetry of this histogram can be estimated directly as the difference in area between the positive and negative regions .",
    "a comparison of this statistic for the bima images and simulations is shown in figure [ fig : asym_survey ] .",
    "it should be noted that the cluster simulations produce an excess of positive pixels compared to simulations of instrumental noise only .",
    "there are no sources with positive flux included in the cluster simulations , however pixels with positive flux are expected due to the sidelobes of the synthesized beam .",
    "a gaussian taper was applied to the @xmath21-@xmath32 data to minimize the sidelobes and this effect .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : asym_survey ] that the observed data is consistent with the asymmetry in the simulations that include galaxy clusters and inconsistent with simulations that include only noise .",
    "for example , the excess of pixels with @xmath110 in the observed data exceeds that in the simulations of instrumental noise at @xmath111 confidence .",
    "the number of pixels with @xmath112 exceeds that found in the simulations of only instrumental noise at @xmath113 confidence .",
    "therefore , the application of this statistic results in a detection of signal with the morphology of the sz effect with a significance comparable to the significance of the detection of excess power reported in section  [ sec : power ] .",
    "in fact , the observed asymmetry in the bima data exceeds the mean value from the noise & sz simulations .    as a simple exercise",
    ", a similar analysis is used to rule out positive flux ( such as point sources ) as the cause of excess power with slightly less confidence ; we simply repeat the analysis described , but with the sign of the flux from clusters reversed .",
    "the excess of pixels with @xmath110 in the observed data exceeds that in the simulations using positive flux at @xmath114 confidence .",
    "the excess of pixels with @xmath112 exceeds that in simulations of instrumental noise at @xmath115 confidence . a more rigorous analysis for point sources would include a more realistic distribution of point sources and take into account the details of their removal using the full , equally weighted , set of visibilities .",
    "this expanded analysis is considered unnecessary given the results of the vla observations , constraints on point sources , and lack of power at finer angular scales .",
    "nonetheless , this method would be useful in cases where rejection of point sources was less certain .",
    "we again conclude that it is very unlikely that point sources are responsible for the asymmetry observed in the bima image pixel fluxes .",
    "a measure of skewness conveys information about the sign of the features producing the deviation from gaussianity .",
    "this quantity can be estimated using the third moment of the data : @xmath116 the skewness of the data derived from the bima images is compared to the skewness determined from the monte carlo simulations in figure [ fig : skewness_survey ] .",
    "analysis of the simulations of instrumental noise alone results in a skewness of @xmath117 at @xmath6 confidence , while the simulations of clusters plus instrumental noise give a mean skewness of @xmath118 .",
    "the skewness in the bima observations was found to be @xmath119 , a value that is inconsistent with the noise only simulations at @xmath120 confidence . repeating the simple analysis described at the end of  [ subsec : ass ] ,",
    "the skewness is inconsistent with positive flux sources as the cause of the observed excess power at @xmath121 confidence .",
    "in addition to the two tests described above , we performed simulations to characterize the significance of outliers in pixel flux distributions of the individual fields .",
    "we identified the most negative pixels in each of the 18 bima fields and compared these with the results of the simulations .",
    "seven bima fields were observed to have decrements with @xmath122 , more than occurred in @xmath123 of the survey simulations with noise only .",
    "two bima fields were observed to have decrements with @xmath124 , more than occurred @xmath125 of the survey simulations including only noise .",
    "none of the observed bima fields had a pixel with positive flux @xmath126 .      in each of the statistical tests described above",
    ", the bima images were found to be inconsistent with those produced by instrumental noise alone at approximately the @xmath127 level , comparable to the significance of the detection of excess power .",
    "although the analysis does not conclusively determine the source of the excess power , the results are consistent with the signal expected from sz galaxy clusters .",
    "the results are also inconsistent with radio point sources being the source of the observed excess power . despite the lack of a definitive conclusion from these tests",
    ", the results are encouraging . in order to investigate what observations",
    "would be required to make a definitive measurement , we performed simulations of the 18 field survey with four times the observation time , or equivalently four times the correlation bandwidth .",
    "these simulations resulted in a detection of excess power and skewness at the @xmath128 level in more than @xmath129 of the simulations .",
    "such a detection would provide convincing evidence for sz clusters as the source of excess power .",
    "to date , all known galaxy clusters have been discovered through optical or x - ray observations .",
    "a negative correlation of the observed fine scale cmb anisotropy with x - ray or optical emission would be a smoking gun for the discovery of a cluster through the sz effect . to search for this correlation , we observed ten of the bima fields using ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "we selected the five fields with significant levels of excess power assuming that they are the most likely candidates for identifying galaxy clusters .",
    "in addition to those five fields , we observed five bima fields that lie at convenient ra during the nights we were awarded time .",
    "imaging was performed using i and r filters on the lris instrument ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the 10 m keck i telescope .",
    "imaging in z was done with the mosaic instrument ( wolfe et al .",
    "1998 ) on the 4 m kitt peak national observatory telescope .",
    "we performed an analysis of the optical images using a method similar to that used in the red cluster survey ( rcs ) survey ( gladders & yee , 2000 ) .",
    "we first categorized objects into two redshift bins determined by color @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the first bin contains only high redshift galaxy candidates .",
    "these candidates have color @xmath132 and @xmath133 , implying a red sequence redshift @xmath134 .",
    "the second bin contains low redshift galaxy candidates .",
    "these candidates have color @xmath135 and @xmath136 implying a redshift @xmath137 . all objects",
    "not satisfying these criteria are considered foreground contamination and are discarded .",
    "an exponential kernel is used to smooth the maps of detected objects in each redshift bin with scale radius of @xmath138 to create a surface density map .",
    "we then create a product map by simply multiplying each surface density map with the corresponding bima map described in ",
    "[ sec : images ] .",
    "the product maps are searched for peaks and asymmetry in the distribution .",
    "statistics are quantified with monte carlo simulations of random bima fields .",
    "the resulting analysis ( described in full detail in dawson , 2004 ) showed no significant correlation between overdensities of galaxies in the optical maps and decrements of flux in the bima @xmath14 ghz maps .    while the follow - up optical observations",
    "do not confirm the hypothesis that the observed anisotropy is caused by the sz effect in galaxy clusters , the method of combining optical and sz observations should prove to be a powerful technique for identifying galaxy clusters in future sz surveys . in this first attempt at doing so , we have not modeled the expected optical cluster signature sufficiently to say what constraints this null result places on the role of sz clusters in producing the observed excess power .",
    "there also remains the possibility that anisotropy from galaxy clusters at redshifts beyond the sensitivity of the optical data , @xmath139 , could be contributing significantly to the observed signal in the bima survey .",
    "in this paper , we report the final results from our search for arcminute scale cmb anisotropy using the bima array . modeling the observed power spectrum with a single flat band power with average multipole of @xmath140 , we find @xmath141k@xmath5 at @xmath6 confidence and a detection of @xmath142 at @xmath143 confidence .",
    "dividing the data into two bins corresponding to different spatial resolutions in the power spectrum , we find @xmath144k@xmath5 at @xmath6 confidence for cmb flat band power described by an average multipole of @xmath3 and @xmath145k@xmath5 at @xmath12 confidence for @xmath9 .",
    "we have used vla observations and various cuts to test for contamination from radio point sources and systematic effects and conclude that it is unlikely that these sources are responsible for the observed signal . if we assume that the measured excess power is due to a background of distant sz clusters , we can compare its value with that from simulations of large scale structure to place a constraint on the normalization of matter fluctuations , @xmath146 at @xmath6 confidence .    in order to try to determine the source of the observed anisotropy power ,",
    "we have performed an analysis of the bima image statistics .",
    "we compared the skewness , asymmetry , and outliers of the measured pixel flux distribution with simulations including noise only and noise plus sz clusters .",
    "a statistical analysis of the bima survey images found that they were consistent with simulations including a background of sz clusters , and inconsistent with simulations of instrumental noise alone or noise plus radio point sources at @xmath147 .",
    "additional monte carlo simulations indicate that with approximately four times the time dedicated to the survey , or equivalently four times the correlated bandwidth , the bima instrument would achieve the sensitivity to test the hypothesis of sz clusters as the source of the observed excess power at greater than @xmath125 confidence",
    ". therefore , future dedicated interferometers , such as the sunyaev - zeldovich array , should be able to effectively use image statistics to determine if any observed anisotropy is due to sz clusters .",
    "finally , we performed a preliminary search for a correlation between red galaxy density and cmb temperature fluctuations .",
