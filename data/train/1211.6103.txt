    "our current knowledge of the intrinsic properties of classical cepheid variables relies heavily on the observational parameters derived for them . in the case of the nearest cepheid , polaris ( @xmath6 umi",

    "* ) , the distance and reddening are of paramount importance for understanding its pulsation mode and evolutionary status . a well - defined space reddening of @xmath5 is implied by studies of its optical companion and other stars lying in the immediate vicinity of the cepheid @xcite , but the distance remains a point of contention .",
    "a photometric parallax can be inferred for polaris using its @xmath8-distant f3  v companion @xcite , which is recognized to be physically associated with the cepheid on the basis of common proper motions and radial velocities @xcite .",
    "the distance derived from zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) fitting for polaris b is @xmath9 pc @xcite , or 109.5 pc from a spectroscopic investigation @xcite .",
    "an investigation of spatially - adjacent a , f , and g - type dwarfs within @xmath10 of polaris observed by hipparcos @xcite reveals two distinct groups lying along the line of sight @xcite , of which only the closer contains stars of comparable proper motion and radial velocity to the cepheid .",
    "the stars also concentrate spatially towards polaris , and appear to constitute the remains of a sparse cluster in the final stages of dissolution into the galactic disk .",
    "the implied distance from zams fitting is @xmath11 pc @xcite , and the corresponding photometric parallax is @xmath0 mas .    with the above reddening",
    ", the photometric distance implies @xmath12 @xcite , consistent with fundamental mode pulsation for a 3.969-day cepheid , along with a location near the center of the instability strip @xcite . a potential conflict with the cepheid s small light amplitude , more typical of stars on the hot and cool edges of the strip ,",
    "was resolved by @xcite using the observation that polaris appears to be in the first crossing of the instability strip .",
    "the cepheid s implied location near strip center , despite an extremely low amplitude , can be attributed to a narrow and blueward - skewed instability strip for first crossers , in which surface convection damps pulsation at significantly warmer effective temperatures than for other crossings ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the redwards evolution of polaris towards the cool edge of the instability strip for first crossers implied by its steady period increase @xcite is also consistent with its apparently decreasing light amplitude @xcite .",
    "results for the trigonometric parallax of polaris differ from those implied by its photometric parallax .",
    "refractor parallaxes summarized by @xcite yield a parallax of @xmath13 mas for polaris , but that does not appear to account for a magnitude dependence in the original allegheny parallaxes , attributed to use of a rotating sector to diminish the flux from bright stars @xcite . if the magnitude - dependent correction found by @xcite is applied , the older parallaxes summarized by @xcite , calibrated relative to allegheny parallaxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yield a best value of @xmath14 mas for the trigonometric parallax of polaris , in agreement with the photometric result .    in contrast , the hipparcos parallax of @xmath15 mas @xcite , or @xmath16 mas from the new reduction @xcite , implies a distance of @xmath17 pc to polaris . at that distance with",
    "the reddening cited previously , the luminosity of the cepheid is @xmath18 , which implies overtone pulsation , consistent with its sinusoidal light curve and small amplitude .",
    "but the intrinsic color of @xmath4 still leaves polaris well inside the hot edge of the instability strip , and its rapid rate of period increase implies either a first or higher than third crossing of the instability strip , with an expected increasing light amplitude . that conflicts with the results for other small amplitude cepheids as well as the long - term decreasing light amplitude observed prior to the 1965 `` glitch '' @xcite . in addition , the a , f , and g - type dwarfs in the vicinity of polaris lying at distances comparable to that inferred from the hipparcos parallax do not share the proper motion or radial velocity of the cepheid @xcite , producing further inconsistencies .",
    "such contradictions were overlooked when @xcite and @xcite used polaris as an overtone pulsator to calibrate the cepheid period - luminosity relation using hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the hipparcos parallax was also adopted by @xcite and @xcite in their analyses of the orbit of the f6  v radial velocity companion , polaris ab , as well as by @xcite with the star s measured angular diameter to estimate its radius .",
    "the process can be inverted for the angular diameter , however , and in combination with the well - established period - radius relation for classical cepheids @xcite yields distance estimates of @xmath19 pc ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 pc ( @xmath22 ) for fundamental mode pulsation , and @xmath23 pc ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath24 pc ( @xmath22 ) for overtone pulsation , where @xmath20 and @xmath22 apply to the limb - darkened and uniform disk solutions , respectively .",
    "agreement with the results from the parallax solutions is less than ideal .",
    "orbital radial velocity residuals @xcite and tests of possible parameters for close orbital companions to polaris @xcite also suggest the possibility of an extra star in the polaris a subsystem , so an independent test of the distance , luminosity , and pulsation mode of the cepheid would be useful .",
    "spectroscopic parallaxes can be derived for cepheids using line ratios , the basis of temperature and luminosity ( @xmath25 ) discrimination in morgan and keenan ( mk ) spectral classification @xcite .",
    "kovtyukh and his collaborators @xcite have taken the technique to its natural limits by using high dispersion spectra and all possible line ratios , in conjunction with calibrations on t@xmath26 and @xmath27 , to establish the luminosities and effective temperatures of yellow supergiants and cepheids with very high precision .",
    "deatils of the calibration philosophy using line ratios involving primarily iron peak elements in the spectra of supergiants of well established luminosity are provided by @xcite .",
    "typically the precision averages @xmath28 in absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath27 ) for a single line ratio in cepheids , but with so many line ratios available per spectrum , of order 4070 @xcite , the precision reached per spectrum reaches a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "the method , although calibrated using yellow supergiants , was established with the aim of studying cepheid variables , and was used recently by @xcite to examine the pulsation modes of three s - cepheids , with fairly robust results : v1334 cyg ( first overtone ) , v440 per ( fundamental mode ) , and v636 cas ( fundamental mode ) .",
    "it is ideal for learning more about polaris , another s - cepheid of extremely small amplitude and an object that is bright and readily accessible from northern hemisphere sites .",
    "the present study addresses the ongoing problem of the distance and pulsation mode of polaris using its spectroscopic parallax .",

    "* ) , and @xcite has noted that most b - type stars in late main - sequence hydrogen burning stages prior to evolution towards the cepheid instability strip already display cno - processed material in their atmospheres .",
    "rapid rotation during main - sequence stages in conjunction with meridional mixing of core material to the stellar surface is sufficient to explain the abundance patterns in cepheids ( see * ? ? ?",

    "a potential problem with the spectroscopic parallax concerns the conclusion reached previously that polaris is in the first crossing of the instability strip , as inferred from its observed rate of period increase of @xmath32 s yr@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the value appears smaller than what is predicted by stellar evolutionary models @xcite , and propose a higher strip crossing mode for polaris that includes a component of the cepheid s period increase arising from mass loss .",
    "there is an alternate solution . in their comparison of observed rates of period change in cepheids with those predicted from stellar evolutionary models",

    "an independent test of the phase - dependent variations in luminosity and effective temperature of polaris is made using line ratios in high dispersion spectra for the star , calibrated using stars of similar metallicity to the cepheid .",
    "the observational results are relevant to the star s distance and pulsation mode . the derived absolute magnitudes @xmath27 and effective temperatures t@xmath26 coincide exactly with similar parameters predicted from the star s photometric parallax @xcite .",
