    "over the past decade , the spectral and spatial properties of non - thermal x - ray emission , presumably synchrotron radiation by multi - tev electrons , in young shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been extensively studied with x - ray satellites , especially with asca and chandra , providing observational support for the general picture that galactic cosmic rays are sustained by strong shocks in snrs @xcite .",
    "an excellent example comes from chandra observations of the tycho s snr , where the remnant is delineated by a thin ( @xmath7 or less ) layer of x - ray synchrotron emission that exhibits spectral steepening behind the shock @xcite .",
    "this strongly indicates that tev - scale electrons are indeed accelerated at the outer blast wave .",
    "the well developed theory of diffusive shock acceleration ( for reviews , see @xcite ) provides a basic framework for our understanding of cosmic - ray acceleration in collisionless snr shocks , though some key ingredients in the theory , especially the generation of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves and their interactions with cosmic - ray particles @xcite , are yet to be understood .",
    "x - ray observations of shell - type snrs can in principle probe the  microphysics \" of the shock acceleration process ; the development of mhd waves can be explored by measuring the energy of the spectral cutoff that is regulated by the acceleration rate , which , in turn , is determined by the shock velocity and the energy density of stochastic magnetic fields relative to ordered fields . in previous work",
    ", it has been presumed that the nonthermal x - ray spectrum is formed by a gradually steepening synchrotron spectrum extending from the radio band , as first outlined by @xcite .",
    "experience shows that it is difficult to establish the presence of a cutoff ( or roll off ) in x - ray spectra that cover only a decade or so in energy , like data typically obtained by asca or chandra .",
    "secure detection of the expected spectral steepening requires a wider bandpass x - ray spectrum .",
    "in contrast , radio observations of snrs sample the energy distribution of accelerated electrons at considerably lower values ( typically gev energies ) where the spectral form is more nearly power - law like , and where the power - law index in the framework of shock acceleration theory is closely related to the shock compression ratio .    the snr rx j1713.7@xmath03946 is a promising candidate to search for a spectral cutoff or steepening using measurements over as wide a wavelength coverage as possible in the x - ray domain .",
    "rx j1713.7@xmath03946 ( also known as g347.3@xmath00.5 ) exhibits the brightest nonthermal x - rays among shell - type snrs ; the total nonthermal x - ray flux ( 210 kev ) integrated over the entire snr amounts to @xmath8 , which is not exceeded by any other shell - type snr .",
    "this was the first snr to be confirmed as a tev @xmath6-ray source using ground - based cherenkov telescopes by two groups , cangaroo @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "detections of tev @xmath6-rays distributed over the entire remnant made with h.e.s.s . with a 110 tev flux of @xmath9 , make this object well suited for exploring cosmic - ray acceleration in shell - type snrs . the spectacular h.e.s.s .",
    "@xmath6-ray image with spatial resolution of a few arc - minutes appears generally quite similar to the x - ray image , suggesting an intimate physical connection between the nonthermal x - rays and tev @xmath6-rays .",
    "due to its faintness in the radio band , the remnant eluded detection in early radio surveys and was only discovered thanks to x - ray observations during the rosat all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "asca revealed intense synchrotron x - ray emission in the northwestern ( nw ) part of the remnant @xcite .",
    "the spectrum here is best - fitted by a power law of photon index @xmath10 with interstellar absorption @xmath11 , and is widely presumed to be synchrotron in nature .",
    "diffuse synchrotron x - ray emission appears to be distributed over the entire face of the snr with similar index ( @xmath12 ) and without measurable thermal x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "faint synchrotron radio emission was detected in rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , especially toward the western shell @xcite . with chandra observations",
    ", it was found that the brightest part of the northwest x - ray shell consists of a complex network of bright filaments and knots embedded in more diffuse emission @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectra of various components in the nw rim are similar to each other and well fit by a power - law function with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "similar spatial and spectral characteristics were found in the southwestern ( sw ) rim as well based on _ xmm - newton _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "a nearby molecular cloud at @xmath14 kpc is likely associated with rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , based on high sensitivity co observations made with the nanten telescope @xcite .",
    "the association between the molecular cloud at @xmath15 kpc and the x - ray remnant is suggested by their close morphological match as well as by the detection of broad - line co emission @xcite .",
    "this is further strengthened by a detailed comparison between the x - ray and molecular emissions @xcite .",
    "the atomic and molecular hydrogen column density as a function of distance along the line - of - sight to the snr reaches a value matching the x - ray absorbing column density at a distance of @xmath16 @xcite , thus providing independent support for an association with the nearby ( 1 kpc ) molecular cloud . with this distance , the guest star that appeared in a.d .",
    "393 possibly corresponds to the supernova explosion from which snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 originated @xcite .",
    "this association would make the remnant 1600 yr old . with this assumption , an x - ray point source ( without an optical / radio counterpart ) near the center of the remnant , 1wga j1713.4@xmath03949 ,",
    "is thought to be an associated neutron star @xcite , indicating a core - collapse supernova .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the supernova explosion occurred within the wind - blown bubble created by the massive progenitor star .",
    "we take the distance to snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 to be 1 kpc in this paper .    here",
    "we report on a wide band x - ray observation from 0.4 to 40 kev of the sw part of rx j1713.7@xmath03946 made with the suzaku satellite .",
    "the high sensitivity in the 1250 kev band offered by the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) on board suzaku together with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) in the 0.412 kev band , allow us to measure for the first time the detailed spectral shape of the nonthermal x - ray emission from a supernova remnant .",
    "since this is the first clear example of detecting extended hard x - ray emission with the hxd , we performed an in - depth analysis of the hard x - ray measurements . in section",
    "[ sec : observation ] , we describe the observations and methods of obtaining the data sets . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we explain the analysis procedures to extract spectra and present spectral fitting for each of the hxd and xis in turn",

    "we discuss the broadband x - ray spectrum in terms of the theory of diffusive shock acceleration in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we observed the southwestern ( sw ) part of rx j1713.7@xmath03946 with suzaku on 2005 september 26 ( in the performance verification phase ) for a total on - source duration of about 60  ks .",
    "the brightest portion of the remnant is its northwest shell , which lies nearly on the galactic plane , where we were concerned that an unexpected transient source could appear and contaminate the hxd field of view .",
    "we therefore chose the second brightest part , i.e. , the sw , to attempt a secure measurement of hard x - ray emission with the hxd .",
    "the x - ray observatory suzaku @xcite , developed jointly by japan and the us , has a scientific payload consisting of two kinds of co - aligned instruments , the xis @xcite and hxd @xcite .",
    "the non - imaging hxd covers the hard x - ray bandpass of 10600 kev with pin silicon diodes ( 1060 kev ) and gso scintillator ( 40600 kev ) , both located inside an active bgo shield .",
    "we here make use of spectral data from the pin diodes .",
    "the low background of the hxd pin enables us to study high energy emission from rx j1713.7@xmath03946 up to several tens of kev .",
    "additionally , a narrow fov of @xmath18 ( fwhm ) , which is defined by passive shields inserted in the bgo well - type collimator above the pin diodes , is better suited to the study of extended emission in comparison with previous missions having larger fovs .",
    "the xis consists of four x - ray imaging ccd cameras covering a fov of @xmath19 ; three are front - illuminated ( fi : 0.412 kev ) , one is back side illuminated ( bi : 0.212 kev ) , and all have good energy resolution of @xmath20 ev at 6 kev .    the observation log for our observations is shown in table [ tab : rxj1713_obs ] . in order to estimate possible contributions from diffuse emission along the milky way in the hard 1060 kev band , we observed two nearby regions in which no apparent hard x - ray point sources exist ( off - pointings , off1 and off2 ) .",
    "the three fields of view are depicted in figure  [ fig : rxj1713_obs_fov ] , overlaid on the asca 15 kev image @xcite .",
    "more recently , one year after the pv phase observations discussed here , we have covered almost the entire remnant using 10 separate pointings during the suzaku ao-1 period .",
    "these results will be published elsewhere ( tanaka et al .",

    "we used data products made with version 1.2 of the pipeline processing . for the xis analysis , we retrieved `` cleaned event files '' which were screened with standard event selections .",

    "also a rather narrow fov defined by a passive collimator suppresses contamination from nearby discrete sources and diffuse emission such as the galactic ridge emission @xcite and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "however , even for a bright object like this target , the pin spectrum is still exceeded by the background  time - variable instrumental background induced in one way or another by cosmic - rays and trapped charged particles in orbit .",
    "the hxd instrument team has developed an effective method @xcite of modeling the time - dependent non - x - ray background ( nxb ) by making use of the pin upper discriminator ( ud ) signal that monitors passing charged particles through the silicon pin diode .",

    "above 1 kev , the upper limit has only a weak dependence of temperature @xcite . here , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 , and @xmath108 are the number density of electrons and hydrogen , the volume of the hot gas , and the distance to the remnant , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : temp_vs_em ] shows the 3@xmath102 upper limits as a function of temperature .",
    "the upper limits grow quite large for @xmath109 .",
    "the emission measure can be as large as @xmath110 if we assume a temperature as low as @xmath111  kev . from the emission measure",
    ", we can estimate the number density of shocked gas . by assuming @xmath112 , uniform distribution of gas inside the remnant , and that the spectral region covers 8% of the whole volume of the remnant ( a sphere of @xmath113 radius ) , we relate the gas density ( @xmath114 ) to the emission measure as @xmath115 for a distance of @xmath116 , the upper limit on the gas density ranges from @xmath117 to @xmath118 when we vary the temperature from 1  kev to 0.05  kev .",
    "this is broadly consistent with previous estimates based on asca @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "( 8cm,8cm)figure / figure10.eps",
    "as established in previous studies ( @xcite ) , the x - ray spectrum extracted from any portion of rx j1713.7@xmath03946 shows a featureless continuum , for which an absorbed power law offers a reasonable fit .",
    "the asca spectrum of the sw part was characterized by a photon index @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the suzaku broadband spectrum for the sw part of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946  reported here clearly indicates the presence of a spectral cutoff as it shows a spectral transition from a relatively flat power law ( @xmath119 ) in the soft x - rays to a steep power law ( @xmath120 ) at harder photon energies .",
    "in fact , the nonthermal featureless x - ray spectrum of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , as well as other nonthermal remnants such as sn  1006 @xcite and vela jr .",
    "@xcite , are widely thought to arise from the gradually steepening high - energy part of the synchrotron radiation spectrum produced by tev - scale electrons , which are accelerated through the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "the cutoff in the suzaku spectrum provides firm observational support for this widely - accepted presumption .",
    "we found that the cutoff energy , presumably set by synchrotron cooling , appears different from one spectral model to another , in a range of @xmath121 kev .",
    "the higher cutoff , @xmath122 kev , is based on the power law with @xmath123-type cutoff model , while the lower bound is derived with @xmath124-type cutoff .",
    "given this fact , we need to be careful in discussing the physical meanings of the position of the spectral cutoff .",
    "we briefly explore the implications of the suzaku broadband spectrum in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "more detailed discussions on this issue will be given elsewhere ( t. tanaka et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "if the magnetic field exceeds @xmath125 in the shell ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , the tev @xmath6-rays detected from the remnant should be explained by protons producing @xmath126-decay @xmath6-rays , rather than by electrons emitting @xmath6-rays via inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "the hadronic model requires the total energy content of protons to amount to @xmath127 in order to explain the observed tev @xmath6-ray flux @xcite .",
    "therefore , a matter density of @xmath128 is needed , assuming the typical kinetic energy released by a supernova of @xmath129  erg and a conversion efficiency to high energy protons of 50% . to reconcile this density value with the upper limit on thermal x - ray emission (  [ sec : thermal ] ) , the electron temperature must be of order 0.1@xmath130kev ( or lower ) , otherwise thermal emission ( @xmath131 ) would have been detected with the suzaku xis .",
    "the low - temperature of thermal electrons may indicate that efficient particle acceleration drains the energy of the shock , thus suppressing gas heating at the shock @xcite .",
    "strong ( high mach number ) shocks in young shell - type snrs do accelerate high - energy particles with remarkably high efficiency , thus providing an ideal laboratory to study high - energy particle acceleration in the universe .",
    "suzaku has excellent capability for determining the spectral form of x - ray synchrotron emission thanks to its broadband spectral coverage from 0.4 to 40 kev .",
    "the observed cutoff energy in the synchrotron x - ray spectrum suggests that shock acceleration proceeds at nearly the maximum possible rate .",
    "combined with the broad tev @xmath6-ray spectrum ( in the 0.3100 tev band ) measured recently with hess , our suzaku observations of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946  provide stringent constraints on shock - acceleration of the highest energy particles in our galaxy .",
