    "nuclear fission is a complex process where a number of different properties of the nucleus influence the characteristics of the resulting splitting . in general , experimental observations",
    "are limited to few observables , making it difficult to isolate the impact of specific nuclear properties on the whole process . as an illustration",
    ", the fission - fragment mass yields have been measured intensively during the last decades , being in fact the result of the proton and neutron sharing between the two fragments .",
    "isotopic yields have been accessible only for the light fragments  @xcite whereas techniques of delayed gamma - spectroscopy led to measures limited in range and in precision  @xcite .",
    "few years back , the measure of the complete distribution of the fragment atomic number was feasible when based on techniques involving inverse kinematics  @xcite , leading to new observations that were not expected from the study of mass distributions  @xcite .",
    "recently , the use of inverse kinematics using transfer- and fusion - induced fission  @xcite has given access to the isotopic distributions of fragments issued from well - defined fissioning systems . in this scenario ,",
    "the neutron excess ( defined as the neutron - to - proton ratio ) of each fragment over the whole distribution is a new observable that allows the investigation of the neutron and proton sharing between fragments during their emergence , the effect of shell structure at scission deformation , and the way both fragments share the total excitation energy . in order to reproduce the data ,",
    "fission models need to make assumptions on the scission configuration ( deformation and nucleon sharing ) and the partition of excitation energy between both fragments .",
    "however , scission - point properties are very difficult to derive experimentally because the fragment detection occurs after neutron evaporation , hiding the exact neutron numbers of the fragments . in general",
    ", the elongation at scission of the fissioning system is revealed by the measure of the total kinetic energy  @xcite while the deformation of fragments and the sharing of the excitation energy is derived from neutron multiplicities measured either directly  @xcite or indirectly from the velocity and energy of both fragments measured in coincidence  @xcite .        in the present paper ,",
    "the kinematic properties of the fission fragments are used to trace back information on the original split at scission . due to the advantages of inverse kinematics ,",
    "the average neutron excess of the fragments can be derived experimentally for the first time , in addition to the total kinetic energy and the neutron multiplicities .",
    "these results put forward unique information on the resulting equilibrium of neutron and proton sharing in the elongation process up to the scission point .",
    "the distance between the fragments and their total excitation energy at scission are also determined and discussed .",
    "the characteristics of the fragment distributions from fission of two different compound nuclei , @xmath0pu and @xmath1cf , have been recently investigated  @xcite .",
    "both fissioning systems were produced using a @xmath2u beam impinging onto a @xmath3c target at 6.1  amev , an energy 10% above the coulomb barrier .",
    "the @xmath0pu fissioning system was populated in ( @xmath3c,@xmath4be ) transfer reactions .",
    "the detection of the target - like nuclei allowed the selection of the different reaction channels and , with the measurement of the energy and angle of the target - like nuclei , the excitation energy produced in the transfer reaction is reconstructed event by event  @xcite . in this work , it is assumed that all the excitation energy produced in the reaction is carried by the beam - like fissioning system .",
    "this approximation has been validated in a recent investigation of the transfer process between @xmath2u and @xmath3c  @xcite . following this assumption ,",
    "@xmath0pu was produced with an excitation energy distribution centered on @xmath5  mev and a width of 6  mev . in the case of @xmath1cf ,",
    "the fissioning system was the result of fusion reactions between the @xmath2u beam and the @xmath3c target .",
    "the detection of the target - like nuclei allowed the selection of the different reaction channels .",
    "the vamos spectrometer  @xcite was used for the identification of the fission fragments and permitted a measure of the complete isotopic distribution of the fission fragments for these well - defined fissioning systems .        at the focal plane of the spectrometer ,",
    "the trajectory of the transmitted fission fragments was determined using two position measurements , giving access to the focal plane vertical and horizontal angles .",
    "the measurement of the time of flight and a trajectory - reconstruction procedure , based on the diagonalization of the spectrometer transport matrix  @xcite , were used to reconstruct the fragment velocity vectors . from this knowledge and the information on the kinematics of the compound nucleus ,",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the fission - fragment velocity vectors in the reference frame of the fissioning nucleus , which defines the fission velocity vector . in the present work",
    ", the fission velocity determination is improved with respect to the previous work  @xcite : the slowing down of the fission fragments in the target has been taken into account , whereas it was considered as negligible previously .",
    "for each fragment , the velocity measured in the laboratory is then corrected for the energy loss following the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the different parameters are adjusted by means of lise++ simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the velocity distributions of each fragment have been corrected for transmission cuts ( angle and ionic charge states ) that modified the mean value of the velocity distribution by few percents .",
    "the resolution of the resulting fission velocities in the reference frame of the fissioning system depends on the resolution of the velocity and angle in the laboratory reference frame , the beam - energy straggling , and the angle and energy of the target - like product in the case of transfer - induced fission .",
    "considering a resolution of 0.4% on the velocity measurement and an angular resolution of 5 mrad  @xcite , the resolution on the resulting fission velocity is better than 2% . at the limits of the vamos acceptance ,",
    "heavier fragments are less transmitted and mass distributions suffer from cuts in their heavier part .",
    "these cuts also impact the velocity determination .",

    "[ vel_z_pu](a ) shows clear deviations of the measured velocities from fission of @xmath0pu with respect to those calculated with fixed deformation and neck parameters around @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these are the signature of smaller deformation in the scission configuration appearing for specific proton and neutron numbers , as will be discussed later . in the case of @xmath1cf ,",
    "the deviations show that for asymmetric splits , the measured velocities are larger than those calculated with fixed @xmath12 and @xmath14  fm .",
    "the fission - fragment velocities contain information on important properties of the scission configuration such as deformation and masses of the nascent fragments . in the reference frame of the fissioning system and due to momentum conservation",
    ", the ratio of the two fragment velocities is equal to the inverse ratio of the initial masses @xmath17 on each fission event : @xmath18 with @xmath19^{-1/2}$ ] .        in the present experiment ,",
    "the velocity of one fragment per fission event is measured .",
    "this is done over the complete fragment production , as shown in the preceding section . in both investigated cases ,",
    "the excitation energy of the fissioning systems is not enough to allow proton evaporation along the fission process , therefore , for a fissioning system of atomic number @xmath20 , the average characteristics , including momentum , of fragments with atomic number @xmath21 are associated to the complementary atomic number @xmath22 . under these conditions , the momentum conservation can relate both fragments as : @xmath23 where the observables with subscript 1 correspond to the fragments with atomic number @xmath21 and those with subscript 2 correspond to its complementary fragment @xmath22 .",
    "the analysis of the measured fragments shows that @xmath24 can be approximated to @xmath25 with a relative error smaller than 0.4% .",
    "the average values of mass excess permit to express @xmath26 as the product of the number of nucleons and the unified atomic mass unit , @xmath27 , with a deviation smaller than 0.01% in @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , a detailed simulation of the isotropic neutron evaporation by fragments , within ranges of velocity , mass , and @xmath9 as the ones measured , confirms that its effect on the fragment velocity is smaller than 0.15% . these approximations allows the use of the relation of eq .",
    "[ eqva ] with the measured velocities averaged for each fragment : @xmath29 assuming that no neutron evaporation occurs from saddle to scission nor from the neck at scission , and knowing the mass of the fissioning system @xmath30 , the average masses at scission can be deduced : @xmath31    in the case of @xmath0pu fissioning system , with an average excitation energy of 9  mev , no pre - scission neutron evaporation is considered ; however , a contamination of 20% from @xmath32pu @xcite renders the final fissioning mass @xmath33 for transfer - induced fission . in the case of @xmath1cf ,",
    "the excitation energy is sufficient to produce neutron evaporation before fission with a multiplicity that depends on the excitation energy and angular momentum induced in the reaction . in a similar reaction with @xmath34o beam on @xmath2u , angular anisotropy has been used to determine the root - mean - squared angular momentum induced in the reaction at an energy close to the coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "a value of 24@xmath35 was determined for this reaction .",
    "calculations based on the bass modelisation  @xcite , adjusted to reproduce the angular reaction of @xmath34o@xmath36u data , give an estimation of 20@xmath35 in the case of the present experiment . this angular momentum and an initial excitation energy of 45  mev lead to an average fissioning system of mass @xmath37 , considering the different fission probabilities obtained from gef  @xcite predictions , where first - chance fission happens in more than 68% of the events .",
    "this result is confirmed by the measurement of pre - scission neutrons emitted from a slightly lighter compound nuclei with similar excitation energy and larger angular momentum , for which a multiplicity of @xmath38 is found  @xcite . the uncertainty estimated on the fissioning - nucleus average mass",
    "is restricted to 0.3 mass units , considering possible small variations on angular momentum and the validity of the model .",
    "the pre - scission neutron evaporation also modifies the average excitation energy of the fissioning system , estimated with the same code in @xmath39  mev .",
    "the experimental neutron excess of the fission fragments is known to vary with the asymmetry of the fission split  @xcite . in the framework of unchanged charge density ,",
    "both fragments keep the same neutron excess as the fissioning nucleus .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed that the light fragments are less neutron rich than this prediction , while the heavy fragments are more neutron rich .",

    "it is also important to note the different nature of the calculation of both post- and pre - neutron neutron excess : the former is evaluated with the direct identification in ( @xmath9 , @xmath46 ) of the fission fragments , while the latter is derived from a continuous observable such as the velocity .",
    "+     the resulting @xmath47 for fission of @xmath0pu shows a step behaviour with a sudden increase that peaks around @xmath48 , paired with a minimum around @xmath49 .",

    "[ nz_pre ] ) . in the case of fission of @xmath1cf",
    ", @xmath47 shows a smooth behaviour and a steady increase with @xmath9 , while neutron evaporation modifies significantly the trend .",
    "the fragments observed after neutron evaporation show a rather constant neutron excess , with no charge polarization .",
    "the smaller error bars observed in the fragments of @xmath1cf reflect the larger statistics in the population of this fissioning system compared to that of @xmath0pu , due to the cross sections of fusion - fission reactions being about a factor 50 larger than that of transfer reactions  @xcite .",
    "the deduced @xmath47 can be compared with a simple calculation based on the scission - point model introduced by wilkins _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the most probable combination of neutron excess of both fragments is defined as the one that minimizes the total energy of the system . in the model used in the present work , only macroscopic energies of the deformed fragments are considered , following the liquid - drop energy prescription of myers and swiatecki  @xcite , including coulomb interaction and neglecting nuclear interaction between the two touching fragments .",
    "the results of this liquid - drop scission - point ( ld - sp ) calculation are displayed in fig .",
    "[ nz_pre ] .",
    "they show a steady increase of the neutron excess of scission fragments with their atomic number , reflecting the need to increase the number of neutrons for counterbalancing the increasing coulomb repulsion inside the heavier fragments . this behavior is observed in experimental data from @xmath1cf , where the compound nucleus fissions at @xmath39  mev of excitation energy .",
    "still , the experimental neutron excess deviates from this smooth behaviour with a sort of `` s '' shape that renders the heavier fragments slightly more neutron rich , and thus lighter fragments less neutron rich , than expected from equilibration of macroscopic strengths .",
    "stronger deviations are observed in the case of @xmath0pu , which is produced with an average excitation energy of 9  mev , due to the influence of the nuclear structure on the sharing of neutrons and protons between the fragments .",
    "apart from these deviations , the deduced @xmath47 and the calculation of the ld - sp model coincide for very asymmetric splits in both systems .",
    "a more realistic calculation , including the effect of nuclear structure and neutron evaporation , can be done with the gef code .",
    "figure  [ nz_pre ] shows the neutron excess calculated with gef at scission and after neutron evaporation for @xmath0pu and @xmath1cf respectively .",
    "the structures appearing in the neutron excess of the @xmath0pu scission and final fragments are well reproduced by gef , with a certain underestimation of the neutron excess for heavier fragments and therefore an overestimation for lighter ones .",
    "these structures are attributed to the effect of shells of protons and/or neutrons that tend to minimize the system energy around certain nucleon numbers in the nascent fragments , modifying their production when compared to pure macroscopic ( or liquid - drop ) behavior . at higher excitation energy",
    ", these effects are expected to be very much reduced  @xcite and the calculations with the gef code are consistent with this expectation .",
    "however , a clear deviation of the experimental data with respect to the code appears in the case of @xmath1cf fission at @xmath39  mev : while the calculations with gef show a steady increase of the neutron excess with the @xmath9 , as observed in the data , a significant deviation of this slope is found between @xmath49 and @xmath51 , rendering light fragments less neutron rich and heavy ones more neutron rich than those obtained with the code . despite this difference , the gef code reproduces the experimental constant value of the measured @xmath50 of the final fragments as a function of their atomic number .",
    "the features of @xmath47 and @xmath50 suggest the need to improve the description of the potential at scission , as well as the sharing of excitation energy , that modifies the neutron excess of fragments between scission and final fragments .",

    "the saw - tooth shape of the neutron multiplicity in low - energy fission is understood as the result of the deformation energy released when the scission fragments separate and recover their ground - state deformation  @xcite . for higher - energy fission ,",
    "the additional excitation energy is shared among the two fragments , while part of it might be evaporated during the saddle - to - scission path .",
    "this additional energy will be also released in part with evaporated neutrons , thus making the neutron multiplicity a probe of the energy sharing between the two fragments . in order to reproduce the observed multiplicities ,",

    "gef calculations show a similar increase , though with a less steep slope . this difference may arise from the treatment on the evolution from constant - density to a fermi - gas description and/or the description of the polarization at scission .",
    "it is worth noting that the comparison of the calculations performed with gef with the experimental data is more sensitive when studying the average multiplicity as a function of the fragment @xmath52 than in the case of the post - scission total multiplicity per fission , defined as the sum of the multiplicities of fragment @xmath21 and its complementary @xmath22 , or the mass difference between the fissioning system and the fragments detected after neutron evaporation : @xmath57    the total multiplicity @xmath58 from fragments of @xmath0pu and @xmath1cf are shown in figs .",

    "the main differences between the systems used in the ldm calculations and those of this work correspond to the excitation energies and angular momenta produced in the reactions inducing fission . in the case of @xmath0pu , thermal - neutron induced reactions yield an excitation energy of @xmath109  mev and negligible angular momentum , while the transfer - induced fission of this work produces a distribution of excitation energy centered at @xmath5  mev and a distribution of angular momentum of the order of @xmath110 ( see  @xcite for a similar reaction ) . the spontaneous fission of @xmath107cf induces neither excitation energy or angular momentum , while the fusion - induced fission measured in this work produces @xmath1cf with @xmath39  mev and an average @xmath111 .",
    "the presented values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 as functions of @xmath9 ( figs .",
    "[ dd0 ] and [ potsurf ] ) can be interpreted as the shape of the potential landscape that the fissioning system experiences at scission . in both systems ,",
    "symmetric splits are characterized by elongated shapes and maxima of potential . in the case of @xmath0pu , signatures of the most produced asymmetric yields , around @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are well correlated with shorter distances between the fragments and features in @xmath116 around @xmath49 and @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ tke](a ) ) , that can be interpreted as the effect of nuclear structure . however ,",
    "the deduced @xmath113 for the same system does not show any distinct behaviour around these atomic numbers . the maxima in @xmath62 and @xmath117 compensate when both are subtracted to calculate @xmath113 , leaving no clear signature in the depth of the potential at scission .",
    "the total excitation energy gained at scission is released by the fragments via post - scission neutron and gamma evaporation until their ground state is reached .",
    "the energy needed to evaporate these neutrons is the sum of their binding energies and their kinetic energy , which is a distribution between 0 and some mev ( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "therefore , the sum of the separation energies of the evaporated neutrons is a lower limit for the energy released by neutron evaporation . from the total neutron multiplicity @xmath58 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_nevap ] ) and the post- and pre - evaporation masses , this limit for the average energy released by neutron evaporation @xmath118 can be estimated as a function of the fragment split as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the ground - state masses post- and pre - evaporation of fragment @xmath91 , and @xmath122 is the neutron mass . the neutron multiplicity evaporated after scission contains information on the excitation energy , including deformation energy , stored by the fragments at scission . in order to access this information from multiplicity measurements , is important to know the fraction of excitation energy carried by neutron evaporation .",
    "figure  [ fenmtot](a ) shows the ratio between @xmath118 and the deduced @xmath123 for the two systems studied .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath118 is similar to the ones observed in the neutron multiplicity in fig .",
    "[ nu ] , as expected .",
    "in both systems , the fraction of @xmath123 evaporated with neutrons is smaller at symmetry , with @xmath0pu reaching some 50% and @xmath1cf showing a flat behaviour between @xmath49 and @xmath124 with more than 60% of @xmath123 .",
    "the two systems take more @xmath123 to evaporate neutrons , reaching up to 80% , as the split becomes more asymmetric , although a flatter behaviour would be within the error bars .",
    "the minimum energy released in neutron evaporation can be also calculated as a function of the fragment @xmath9 : @xmath125 figure  [ fenmtot](b ) shows @xmath126 as a function of @xmath9 for both systems . as in the case of @xmath118 ,",
    "the behaviour is similar to the ones observed in the neutron multiplicity in fig .",
    "[ nu ] , with the heavy fragments , particularly in @xmath1cf , releasing more excitation energy in the form of neutron evaporation .",
    "this energy @xmath126 is a fraction of the excitation energy that each fragment stores up to scission , the rest being released as gamma emission . for fission with high @xmath127 , where structure effects vanish , it is expected that the total @xmath128 is shared between the fragments according with their mass ratio at scission  @xcite : @xmath129 being @xmath130 the excitation energy of the fragment , following this prescription .",
    "it is important to note that , in any case , structure effects would not modify the @xmath131 partition for symmetric or very asymmetric splits ( see  @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "for lower energy fission , this behaviour is less valid , even at very asymmetric splits , for reasons different from pure structure effects .",
    "direct measurements of neutron multiplicity show that the heavy fragment keeps more excitation energy than eq .",
    "[ eq_exeq ] or structure effects predict  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the level density and the temperature with the mass of the fragment prevents them to reach equal temperatures , with the heavier fragment always cooler than the lighter one , and thus dragging more energy , resulting in an excitation energy of the hevier fragments larger than the predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq_exeq ]  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fenmtot](b ) compares the deduced @xmath126 with @xmath132 . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath126 of heavier fragments reaches similar values as their corresponding @xmath132 , while light fragments take less than the half of it .",
    "this behaviour suggests that , in both systems , the actual @xmath131 of the heavy fragments should be larger than @xmath132 in order to allow for the kinetic energy of the neutrons and gamma evaporation .",
    "this observation favors the description of a continuous flow of @xmath131 from the light to the heavy fragments due to their unbalanced temperatures .",
    "with the new generation of high - quality fission data obtained in inverse kinematics , new observables of the fission process are available . from the reconstructed fission kinematics ,",
    "the total kinetic energy @xmath62 and average masses of the two fragments can be reconstructed at scission as a function of the fragment atomic number . in this work ,",
    "the neutron excess of fragments is determined at scission for two different fissioning systems , @xmath0pu and @xmath1cf , with different excitation energies . for the first time ,",
    "an experimental insight on the proton and neutron sharing during the elongation process is put forward . in addition",
    ", the measurement of the total kinetic energy at scission allows the determination of the distance between fragments and the total excitation energy available . in the low - energy fission of @xmath0pu , @xmath62 and",
    "the mass difference @xmath117 show similar structures that may be a signature for the formation of little - deformed , closed - shell nuclei .",
    "these structures compensate when subtracted to estimate the total excitation energy @xmath133 released in fission .",
    "this leads to an almost constant energy release of about @xmath134  mev over the complete fragment distribution .",
    "the symmetric fission is observed to be associated with a slightly more energetic release of almost 30  mev . in the higher - energy fusion - induced fission of @xmath1cf , with no neutron evaporation considered between saddle and scission",
    ", the neutron excess of the scission fragments shows a steeper change around symmetry when compared to ld - sp and gef models , resulting in more neutron - rich heavy fragments .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath62 points to a smooth evolution of the scission configuration with the fragment split , with a flat behaviour around symmetry .",
    "this behaviour , together with the estimation of the distance between the fragments , indicates an almost constant elongation , though different from simple liquid - drop model considerations .",
    "also in @xmath1cf higher - energy fission , a strong evolution of @xmath133 is observed , with 25  mev more excitation energy in the symmetric splits than in the very asymmetric splits .",
    "a lower limit for the fraction of @xmath135 released by neutron evaporation was found to evolve with the fragment split and to be above 50% of the total in both systems .",
    "the calculation of a lower limit of excitation energy released by neutron evaporation as a function of @xmath9 suggests that the partition of @xmath135 between the fragments according to their masses is not valid for these systems with @xmath136 and @xmath137  mev ; being more suitable the description with unbalanced temperatures and continuous flow of energy from the light to the heavy fragment .",
