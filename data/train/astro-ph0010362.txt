    "x - ray observations have revealed that the radiative cooling time of the intra - cluster - medium ( icm ) around the central galaxy of many clusters is much less than the cluster age ( e.g. edge , stewart , and fabian @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that cooling of the icm could strongly affect the cluster thermal structure ( e.g. fabian @xcite ) .",
    "although pre - chandra / xmm observations established the presence of plasma near the cluster center considerably cooler than that found further out in the cluster ( e.g. allen et al .",
    "@xcite ; makishima et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the detailed spatial and thermal structure of this cool component , and hence its nature , has not yet been fully understood .",
    "in addition the measurement of the elemental abundances in this cooler gas provides critical information concerning its formation and evolution .    here",
    "we report the first results from the xmm ( jansen et al .",
    "@xcite ) observations of a rich cluster of galaxies , abell 1795 ( a1795 for short ) .",
    "this cluster , at a redshift of 0.0631 , is one of the best targets for spectral study of the cluster center with xmm .",
    "this is because of its peaked x - ray emission and a cool ( 24 kev ) component at the cluster center ( briel and henry @xcite ; fabian et al .",
    "@xcite ; fabian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . based on the the deprojection of the x - ray image a strong cooling flow with a mass deposition rate , @xmath4 , of @xmath5  @xmath6yr was reported ( edge et al .",
    "@xcite ; allen et al .",
    "the asca spectra showed a smaller level of the cooling flow with @xmath4 of @xmath7  @xmath6yr ( allen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have measured the temperature structure and metal abundances of the central region based on x - ray spectra with high spectral resolution . throughout this @xmath8 , we assume the hubble constant to be @xmath9 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 and use the 90% confidence level unless stated otherwise .",
    "one arc - minute corresponds to 110 kpc .",
    "xmm observations of a1795 were performed on 2000 june 26 during the performance verification phase . the three epics ( turner et al .",
    "@xcite ) were operated in the full window mode with the thin filter .",
    "the rgs ( den herder et al .",
    "@xcite ) were operated in the spectroscopy mode .",
    "the rgs dispersion axis is oriented along an axis of about @xmath11 degrees ( north to east ) .",
    "we report on simultaneous uv / optical observations with the optical monitor in another @xmath8 ( mittaz et al .",
    "using the epic spatially - resolved spectra we have measured large - scale properties of the cluster .",
    "then , utilizing the high resolution rgs spectra we constrain the temperature structure in the cluster core .    for basic data processing , we used the development version of the science analysis system ( sas ) for all data .",
    "the epic and rgs events were screened by rejecting the high background periods .",
    "useful exposure times for epic / pn , epic / mos and rgs are 25 ksec , 34 ksec , and 41 ksec , respectively .",
    "the background spectra for these instruments were taken from lockman - hole observations and subtracted before the spectral fitting below .",
    "the epic data were corrected for telescope vignetting . for spectral fitting",
    ", we utilize the spex ( kaastra et al .",
    "@xcite ) and xspec ( arnaud @xcite ) packages .",
    "we model the plasma emission using the mekal emission code ( mewe et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but with updated wavelengths according to phillips et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we extracted the spectra from the three epic detectors separately in annuli around the emission center with outer radius ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the emission from the strongest point sources was subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the mos spectra were fitted with an isothermal model .",
    "the column density @xmath14 was assumed to be the galactic value of @xmath15  @xmath16 .",
    "we obtained statistically acceptable fits for all annuli .",
    "the obtained temperature , metallicity , and hydrogen density are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - ta ] .",
    "the pn spectra were also fitted with the same model . in this case , the @xmath14 was left free , in order to constrain absorption due to possible cold gas in the cluster .",
    "the fits are statistically acceptable for all annuli and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - ta ] .",
    "these results are consistent among the two instruments , except for temperatures measurements beyond 4 .",
    "the difference in the temperature between pn and mos may be caused by residual uncertainty in the background subtraction .",
    "the obtained column density from the pn indicates no excess absorption above the galactic value . within @xmath172  in radius from the center ,",
    "the temperature decreases and the metallicity increases towards the center . with the large effective area and moderate spatial resolution of the instrument , we could resolve the icm structure in sub - arcmin scale .    for further examination of the central temperature structure",
    ", we have fit the epic spectra within a radius of 2  using two thermal components .",
    "the temperature of the hotter component was consistent with the value obtained for the outer regions .",
    "for the cooler component we have obtained reasonable fits ( @xmath18 of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for pn and mos , respectively ) using an isothermal component with a temperature of 24  kev .",
    "alternatively , we attempted to model the cool component by an isobaric cooling flow model ( johnstone et al .",
    "@xcite ) , however in order to obtain a good fit to this model the temperature distribution had to be cut - off at @xmath21  kev . essentially no cooler gas is seen directly in the epic data .",
    "the mass deposition rate of the cooling flow was poorly constrained ( 3003000  @xmath6year ) due to a strong correlation with the emission measure of the hot component .",
    "this is due to the relative high cut - off temperature only a factor of 23 below the temperature of the hot component .",
    "fits with a very small cut - off temperature did not produce acceptable fits with @xmath18 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for pn and mos when @xmath24  kev .",
    "the rgs spectra ( rgs1 and rgs2 ) were extracted from the central @xmath25 in full - width . because of the principle of the instrument , each spectrum contains emission from a range of different projected positions .",
    "based on the mos image in the rgs energy band , we estimate that in the central rgs spectrum , more than about 50 - 60% and 80% of the flux comes from projected radii of @xmath26  and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "based on these spectra , we examine the nature of the central region of the cluster . we have detected the lyman  @xmath3 line clearly with an intensity of @xmath28 photons / s .",
    "the measured line wavelength is @xmath29    and consistent with a redshift of 0.0631 within the statistical errors .",
    "the wavelength uncertainty corresponds to a velocity shift of @xmath5 km  sec@xmath10 .",
    "the observed fwhm of the line is about 150 m , which corresponds to a source extent of @xmath171  in width .",
    "in addition to the line , also some line blends in the wavelength range of 1114    are observed . these are mainly due to ( around 10.6    and 11.2   ) , ( 12.1   ) , and ( 12.2   ) . these line measurements should constrain the presence of material with a temperature of 0.53 kev .",
    "the epic data showed that the cluster core region is close to being isothermal with a temperature of 34 kev .",
    "for further examination of this isothermality , we fitted the central rgs spectra with an isothermal model .",
    "the effects of a finite source extent were taken into account as follows .",
    "we calculated the line spread function based upon the source surface brightness profile and convolved this with the rgs response for a point source .",
    "a @xmath30 model was assumed for the brightness profile .",
    "the core radius was a free parameter in the spectral fitting procedure .",
    "we limited the wavelength band to 10 - 23    and 10 - 20    for rgs1 and rgs2 , respectively , where most of the interesting emission lines are expected , and the estimated background is less than 10% of the source flux .",

    "this could be due to line blends from .",
    "however , this structure is not seen in the rgs2 spectrum .",
    "in addition , the maximum allowed emission measure from these blends , for a temperature of @xmath43  kev is on the order of 1% of the total emission measure obtained above .",
    "therefore , we conclude this residual is not significant .",
    "non - statistical noise in background may be the origin of this structure .",
    "the line profiles can be described using a core radius of 20@xmath4430  for the assumed brightness profile .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the observed x - ray brightness ( xu et al .",

    "the @xmath14 value obtained is above the galactic value as well as the value obtained with the epic above .",
    "the excess [ @xmath45  @xmath16 ] is within the systematic uncertainty due to the rgs response and the estimated background .",
    "thus , the rgs spectra do not require an additional cool component with a temperature lower than 3 kev in addition to the isothermal model .",
    "nevertheless , within the central region ( @xmath47 ) , the cooling time inferred from x - ray observations is much smaller than the possible cluster age ( edge et al .",
    "this suggests the presence of cool material with a range of temperatures .",
    "in fact , a recent chandra observation revealed cool emission ( @xmath48  kev ) around the cd galaxy ( fabian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to constrain the possible cool component",
    ", we fitted the data by adding a cooler plasma component in addition to the isothermal model .",
    "firstly , we considered an additional isothermal component . since the rgs is not so sensitive to hot plasma ( @xmath49 kev ) we fixed the hot component temperature @xmath50 to 6.4 kev , the icm value obtained with the epic .",
    "the abundances of both components were fixed to 0.4 solar , except for the ne abundance .",
    "the ne abundance was fixed to 0.64 times solar based on the isothermal fits .",
    "the @xmath14 value was also fixed to @xmath51  @xmath16 , which is the best - fit value for the isothermal model .",
    "we measured the upper limits to the volume emission measure of the cool component , @xmath52 , for a given temperature of the cool component , @xmath53 .",
    "the emission measure of the hot component , @xmath54 , was left free .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ei - t ] .",
    "when @xmath53 is below 1.5  kev , @xmath52 is less than 10% of @xmath54 .",
    "secondly , we considered a continuous distribution in temperature based on an isobaric cooling flow model ( cf ; johnstone et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model , @xmath52",
    "was assumed to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the mass deposition rate , mean molecular weight , and the proton mass , respectively .",
    "@xmath58 is the cooling function .",
    "the temperature of the hot component , @xmath50 , the abundances of both components , and @xmath14 were fixed to the same values as above .",
    "the maximum temperature of the cf , @xmath59 , was fixed to the same value as @xmath50 .",
    "this cf component was added to the isothermal component .",
    "we found a 90% upper limit to @xmath4 of 150 @xmath6yr .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the result based on the deprojection analysis ( edge et al .",
    "@xcite ) where a cooling flow age of a hubble time was assumed . when we assume a cooling flow with @xmath60 @xmath6yr based on edge et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the lower temperature should be larger than @xmath17 1.4 kev in order to produce the observed rgs spectra .",
    "the cumulative @xmath52 of the cf model with this upper limit @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ei - cf ] .",
    "similar to the two temperature model fitting , the emission measure of the cool component is very small compared to that of the hot component .",
    "these tight upper limits were obtained through the lack of emission lines such as ( 12.8    in the rest frame ) and ( around 15    and 17   ) in the observed spectra . in order to constrain the limit more directly and confidently , we focused on particular ionization stages of ions and their line emissions .    the line at a rest wavelength of 15.0    is a sensitive indicator of plasma with a temperature of 0.20.8 kev . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs - spe ] , the rgs spectrum indicates no significant residual at this wavelength . by adding this line to the isothermal model we derived an upper limit to the line intensity of @xmath61 photons@xmath6s .",
    "a further constraint can be derived from the blends at a rest frame wavelength of 12.8   .",
    "this is sensitive to a temperature of 0.52.0 kev .",
    "the upper limit to the blends is @xmath62 photons@xmath6s .",
    "these line measurements place limits on the presence of cool component(s ) without the assumptions used above on the temperature structure and the detailed emission model .",
    "we calculate @xmath52 based on the line intensities measured for a given @xmath53 and metallicity , following canizares et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ei - t ] . the predicted emission measure based on the line intensity of the line",
    "is also shown , for reference .",
    "here we assumed an o and fe abundance of 0.3 and 0.5 solar , respectively , based on our measurement .",
    "the emission measure of the possible cool component is less than 10% of that of the hot component within the central volume when @xmath53 is below 1 kev .    when we assumed the isobaric cooling flow model for @xmath52 , the limits for correspond to @xmath4 = 120  @xmath6yr .",
    "this is similar to the value obtained above based on the spectral fitting , indicating that @xmath4 is strongly constrained by a lack of the lines in the spectra .",
    "the abundance of o and its ratio to other elements in the icm strongly depends on its origin . nevertheless , previous measurements of the o abundance had a large uncertainty ( e.g. canizares et al .",
    "@xcite ) , except for a few cases ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",
    "this is not only because of the limited sensitivity to o lines but also because of uncertainty in the temperature structure of the icm .",
    "we detected the lyman @xmath3 line clearly for the first time in this cluster and we constrained the temperature structure tightly .",
    "this provides a good opportunity to measure the o abundance .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl : rgs - fits ] , the isothermal fits to the rgs data yielded an o abundance of 0.20.5 with respect to solar .",
    "when we used the central icm temperature of 4.5 kev determined by epic , the o abundance is 0.270.47 .",
    "based on the xmm observations of abell 1795 , we have obtained the following results .",
    "the temperature and metallicity of the icm are radially uniform at radii from 28  ( @xmath63 kpc ) , with an observed temperature of 67 kev and metallicity of 0.20.3 solar .",
    "this confirms the previous idea that the cluster is close to being dynamically relaxed ( e.g. , briel and henry @xcite ) .    below a radius of @xmath64 the effective temperature of",
    "the icm starts to decrease towards the center from 67 kev to 34 kev . except inside the central 1",
    "the observed temperature profile agrees well with that obtained from a deprojection analysis based on the cooling flow model ( edge et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the contrary",
    ", we found lack of emission from cool ( @xmath65  kev ) gas in the cluster center , compared to the prediction from the strong cooling flow ( @xmath66  @xmath6yr ) .",
    "the epic and rgs spectra extracted from the cluster center ( @xmath67@xmath68 ) can be described by an isothermal model with a temperature of @xmath1 kev .",
    "furthermore , through the absence of clear and line emission in the rgs spectra , the emission measure of any cool component with a temperature in the range @xmath69  kev is found to be at least a factor of 3 lower than that would be expected from the strong cooling flow .",
    "the absence of the predicted amount of cool emission is also supported by the cut - off temperature of @xmath172.4  kev found by fitting cooling flow models to the epic data .",
    "the absence of these emission lines is difficult to model with a uniformly covering absorber , both covering the hot and cool components , and we derive a covering fraction of @xmath70% for gas of sufficient column density ( @xmath71  @xmath16 ) necessary to `` hide '' the iron lines .",
    "we derived an upper - limit to @xmath4 , of @xmath72 @xmath6yr , which is smaller than found by allen et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xmath73  @xmath6yr ) based on the asca spectral analysis .",
    "the present observation indicates that at temperatures greater than 3 kev the icm is cooling as predicted by the cooling flow picture . nevertheless , we have no direct spectral evidence that the gas continues cooling below 2 kev .",
    "this result for a  1795 is similar to what has been found in a  1835 ( peterson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and srsic 159 - 03 ( kaastra et al .",
    "@xcite ) . a full discussion of possible explanations for the lack of observed cool gas is given by peterson et al . ( @xcite ) in their analysis of the a  1835 cluster .",
    "we detected the ly  @xmath3 line from the cluster center with the rgs .",
    "the o abundance was found to be 0.20.5 solar value .",
    "this is similar to the value obtained in the center of the virgo cluster ( matsumoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) based on asca spectra , and in the centers of a  1835 ( peterson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and srsic 159 - 03 ( kaastra et al .",
    "@xcite ) based on xmm / rgs spectra .",
    "the o to fe ratio at the cluster center is @xmath74 times the solar ratio . since oxygen and iron",
    "are mainly produced in type ii and type ia supernovae , respectively , the observed ratio suggests significant contributions from both type ia and type ii to the metal enrichment at the cluster center . in the core",
    "the fe abundance is a factor of 2 larger than in the outer parts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : r - ta ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the general idea that the iron abundance is higher around the cd galaxy ( fukazawa @xcite ; fukazawa et al .",
