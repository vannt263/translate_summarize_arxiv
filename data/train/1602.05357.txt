    "energy transport in one - dimensional systems is a fundamental problem in non - equilibrium physics .",
    "its understanding , besides the clear importance for technological applications  @xcite , is tightly bound to a number of fundamental issues in statistical mechanics .",
    "the existence of an anomalous transport regime in opposition to the failure of fourier s law , and its connection to the underlying chaotic dynamics were extensively studied in classical interacting systems  @xcite . in quantum systems , the long standing interest in heat transport in nanowires and one - dimensional edge modes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) has been recently reinforced by corresponding studies in cold atomic systems  @xcite .    in the spirit of quantum quenches  @xcite , which are typically implemented in cold - atom setups  @xcite , energy transport in one - dimensional quantum many - body systems",
    "can be addressed by means of the following _ partitioning _ protocol  @xcite .",
    "two ( ideally semi - infinite ) chains are prepared in thermal equilibrium with different temperatures ( see the sketch in fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the two chains are then connected and the system evolves unitarily to a steady state which depends on the initial state and on the total hamiltonian of the two half - chains and the connecting link .",
    "a transient regime first appears in which an energy current develops between the two halves .",
    "then , in the thermodynamic limit , a steady state will be reached and this long - time behaviour may be characterized by a finite or zero energy current .",
    "notice that this situation is quite different from the setups usually employed for solid - state devices , where a finite - length wire is connected at both ends to two thermal reservoirs .    in the case of homogeneous interacting chains approximated at low - energy by a conformal field theory ( cft ) ,",
    "the low - temperature energy current was predicted to be finite and universal in the steady state  @xcite .",
    "the result was further confirmed numerically in spin chains  @xcite and analytically for free fermions  @xcite .",
    "while it is clear that this description must apply in some time regimes , in the stationary state the non - universal features of the specific model under consideration might play a major role .",
    "in particular , it is not yet clear whether the energy current can be different from zero in the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) of general interacting spin - chain models .",
    "earlier works addressing transport in one - dimensional interacting quantum systems within the framework of linear - response theory have pointed out that integrability and in particular the existence of conserved quantities is crucial for the presence of a persistent energy current  @xcite . there , the persistence of the current was related to an equilibrium drude weight ; afterwards the relation between integrability and transport properties fully emerged and it was intensively scrutinized in numerous important works ( see  @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "these results call for the understanding of the intimate relation , if any , between the properties of the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) and the universal features of the evolution , such as integrability , also in the partitioning protocol .    in an early work",
    ", it was suggested that the crucial property is not mere integrability but the presence of a conserved quantity which has non - zero overlap with the energy current  @xcite .",
    "following the ideas presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analytical ansatz for the steady state of the spin-1/2 xxz model , where the total energy current commutes with the hamiltonian , was proposed and found in good agreement with numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "more recently , under reasonable hypotheses it was demonstrated that when the energy current is a conserved quantity , the energy flow must be ballistic and a non - vanishing stationary current is expected  @xcite . for a review of several other peculiar features of the partitioning protocol , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in its simplicity",
    ", the quench protocol considered here poses a number of very interesting questions , some of them still to be answered .",
    "what are the conditions for the steady - state current to be finite ? on the other hand , when is the overall system going to equilibrate to a thermal state ?",
    "moreover , in one - dimensional spin-1/2 chains bosonization highlights the differences between low - lying bosonic modes and the high - energy fermionic quasi - particles . how do the different scattering properties of these excitations affect the universal low - temperature results for the energy current derived in ref .",
    "how do these results extend to higher temperatures ?    in order to contribute to some of these issues , we consider the energy transport between two half - infinite xxz chains with different ( and possibly space - dependent ) couplings . in this setup , we can explore how , at low energies , different interaction parameters and different velocities of propagation for the bosonic modes affect the value of the steady - state current .",
    "moreover , in this way we are able to study the effect of local integrability - breaking on the dynamics of the energy current . in most of the paper",
    "we will consider the case in which the couplings are uniform in each half - chain ( but with a difference between left and right ) .",
    "we also consider a smooth crossover between the two halves which extends over a finite region . in this way we can also investigate the impact of an adiabatic junction on the scattering of the low - lying modes and hence on the energy transport .",
    "what we found is that a pre - equilibration behaviour may set in : the energy current reaches a finite value and then slowly decays toward zero . at low - temperature ,",
    "this can be justified analytically and is peculiar of the setup we consider . in particular , when the sound velocities of the two halves are matched , the energy current becomes almost stationary and its value is not universal .",
    "such pre - thermal regime is still observable at intermediate temperatures by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the asymptotic long - time regime is characterized by the absence of any energy flow .",
    "the onset of an effective temperature occurs on longer time - scales not observable with our methods .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we define in detail the model that we consider , the partitioning protocol anticipated in this introduction , and the observables under exam . in section  [ sec : low_energy ] we discuss the low - temperature regime , where bosonisation leads to an analytic form of the steady - state current .",
    "numerical results confirming the previous predictions ( but also addressing higher temperatures ) are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "these calculations are performed with algorithms exploiting the matrix product states ( mps ) formalism . on the basis of these results , in section  [ sec : scenario ] we present a general scenario for energy transport in inhomogeneous quasi - integrable models .",

    "\\label{eq : current0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to point out the existence of a stationary energy current in one - dimensional systems , it is customary to employ arguments based on the linear - response theory .",
    "these arguments are not applicable here , so that we do not expect any ballistic transport of energy at large times , @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , we provide evidence that the system is non - integrable and that no conserved quantity prevents the current from decaying to zero .",
    "we first observe that @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe two xxz models with different parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "they are integrable , as confirmed by the poissonian level - spacing statistics and the existence of an infinite number of conserved local operators .",
    "in particular , the energy current operator @xmath23   \\label{eq : energy : current : density}\\ ] ] is a conserved density because of the following continuity equation : @xmath24 = \\hat k_{\\lambda , n-1}-\\hat   k_{\\lambda , n}.\\ ] ] thus , the integrated energy current from site @xmath25 to site @xmath26 @xmath27 changes in time only because of the boundary terms @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "operators @xmath30 are usually interpreted as _ longitudinal pressures _",
    "additionally , the two hamiltonians are exactly solvable with bethe ansatz even in presence of a hard - wall boundary , as in this case . even if the hamiltonian @xmath15 in eq .",
    "is obtained by joining two integrable models , whenever @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) the integrability is broken .",
    "this can be directly observed by inspection of the level - spacing statistics , which already at finite size suggests an abrupt change to a wigner - dyson distribution ( see appendix  [ app : levstat ] for more details ) .",
    "we note that defining integrability is a subtle problem in quantum mechanics  @xcite . here",
    ", we refer to the notion of integrability associated to bethe ansatz solvability , for which the level spacing statistics has been shown to be poissonian  @xcite . at the same time , this model is not known to display any non - trivial local conserved quantity beyond the total energy and magnetization .",
    "thus , there seems to be no element in the dynamics that supports a stationary current  @xcite .    however , the original properties of the two halves translate into just a _ local _ source of integrability breaking .",
    "let us consider for example the energy - current operator : @xmath35 the cases where @xmath36 or @xmath37 can be easily deduced but are not considered explicitly here .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath38 reads : @xmath39 = \\hat k_{l , a } - \\hat k_{r , b } + \\hat \\theta   \\label{eq : theta}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a local operator with support on a few sites around @xmath16 ( see appendix  [ app : theta ] for the explicit formula ) .",
    "when @xmath41 , the fact that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are localized on a few sites which are far from the junction allows for the derivation of a lower bound on @xmath44 which is valid beyond linear response theory .",
    "this has been explicitly carried out in a general situation which includes the case when @xmath45 and @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the argument links the local energy current @xmath44 to @xmath38 for @xmath47 assuming a sufficiently regular transient behaviour of @xmath48 along the chain .",
    "even if this argument can not be applied to our case of interest , the locality of the @xmath40 operator may allow the persistence of a quasi - stationary current in the long - time regime . in the following",
    "we will see that a pre - equilibration behavior emerges with non - zero energy current , which in some regimes can be quantitatively predicted .",
    "thermalisation and in particular the absence of energy flows ( @xmath49 ) occur only at later stages which are not numerically accessible .",
    "we will characterize them by general arguments .",
    "this does not happen in the special case @xmath50 and @xmath46 , which has been the subject of extensive numerical and analytical studies  @xcite . in this case",
    "there is no occurrence of thermalisation even at very large times , and , in particular , the stationary state depends strongly on the initial condition in the two halves .",
    "we begin by presenting an analytical formula for @xmath51 in the pre - equilibration limit . in the low - temperature regime",
    ", one can exploit the low - energy ( le ) field - theory and bosonisation to derive a transmission coefficient which originates from the inhomogeneity of the hamiltonian @xmath15 in eq .",
    "and generalises the formula obtained for the homogeneous case in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start rewriting the hamiltonian density @xmath52 in eq .   in terms of canonical local fermionic operators by standard jordan - wigner transformation as @xmath53",
    "since the inhomogeneous model preserves the total magnetization and for @xmath54 its ground state @xmath55 is still in the zero magnetization sector ( @xmath56 ) , we have @xmath57 .",

    "although nobody has yet identified the minimal conditions for thermalisation , the expectation is that generic systems ( e.g. exhibiting wigner - dyson level spacing statistics ) should thermalize .",
    "we have argued that at long times the current at the junction @xmath51 decays to zero ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] ) . whereas this steady - state property is a direct consequence of the assumption of thermalisation , it is possible to further elaborate on how the system approaches this situation .",
    "in particular , we will now elaborate on the existence of two domains of growing size which ( i ) are characterized by a non - zero energy current and ( ii ) propagate from the junction towards the two extremities of the chain ( see the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch:3 ] ) .",
    "we begin by showing that @xmath178 must grow linearly in time for @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",

    "[ subsec : effbeta ] , here it suffices to assume the reasonable inequality @xmath186 . recalling that @xmath25 is still outside the light cone and",
    "thus @xmath187 is a thermal expectation value with inverse temperature @xmath188 , the following holds : @xmath189 and the integrated current @xmath178 increases linearly in time as long as the wavefront has not reached @xmath25 .",
    "a simple analysis shows that this happens also on the right half of the system in a similarly defined @xmath190-@xmath26 region .",
    "how is it possible to make this result compatible with the fact that for long times @xmath191 ?",
    "the simplest scenario entails two domains which propagate in opposite directions , respectively in the right and in the left half .",
    "the size of each domain naturally grows because its two edges propagate due to different physical phenomena .",
    "the most external edge moves with the wavefront velocity at which energy is spreading in the chain .",
    "the most internal one is related to the spread of thermalisation originating from the junction .",
    "thus , even if at short times the quenched dynamics resembles that of the homogeneous case , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : preequilibration ] , the integrability - breaking induces thermalisation and accordingly a slow decay to zero of @xmath51 .",
    "this feature first appears at the junction and then affects all the other sites of chain .",
    "a last comment is in order .",
    "since @xmath192 , using the previous results we obtain that @xmath193 also grows linearly in time .",
    "indeed , @xmath194 is a bounded operator that can not compensate the linear growth in time of the other two terms .",
    "since it has been shown that @xmath193 grows linearly in time also for the homogeneous chain , where @xmath195 , this indicates that there is no general connection between @xmath44 and @xmath196 in the asymptotic long - time limit .",
    "the discussion related to eq .   is valid only for intermediate times where quasi - stationarity appears and @xmath51 is still different from zero .",
    "we now consider the problem of identifying @xmath185 . in highly inhomogeneous scenarios , such as the one considered in this article , different regions of the system may experience thermalisation both ( i ) at different times and ( ii ) at different effective temperatures .",
    "here , for example , the asymptotic extrema of the chain are always thermal at their initial temperatures ; additionally , we expect thermalisation at @xmath185 to occur first at the junction and then propagate towards the edges . in similar situations with well - defined initial temperatures and unitary dynamics ,",
    "the problem has been approached within the framework on onsager kinetic equation  @xcite . in order to link these methods to our microscopic model",
    ", it would be necessary to derive , at a coarse - grained level , a hydrodynamical equation governing the temperature dynamics in our system . here",
    "we limit ourselves to some general considerations related to some fundamental constraints for a microscopic theory of thermalisation in a inhomogeneous system .    in typical quench problems ,",
    "the conservation of energy ( the time evolution is unitary ) makes it natural to define @xmath185 through the following implicit equation : @xmath197}{\\text{tr}[e^{- \\beta_l \\hat h_l } ] } +    \\frac{\\text{tr}[\\hat h_r e^{- \\beta_r \\hat h_r}]}{\\text{tr}[e^{- \\beta_r \\hat h_r } ] }    =   \\frac{\\text{tr}[\\hat h e^{- \\beta^ * \\hat h}]}{\\text{tr}[e^{- \\beta^ *",
    "\\hat h}]}.   \\label{eq : beta : star}\\ ] ] however , if one considers a situation where the ratio between the lengths of the left and right halves is not @xmath125 , as assumed until now , but a different fraction , one realizes that the estimation of @xmath185 from eq .   changes .",
    "this is absurd as the local dynamics does not involve the boundary and thus is not affected by this rescaling .",
    "intuitively , this equation assumes that the stationary state inside the light cone is affected by the total amount of energy , and thus also by the fraction which lies outside it .",
    "however , this latter fraction could not play any role in the equilibration dynamics and can not affect the value of the stationary temperature .",
    "this discussion highlights the fact that thermalisation is a local process which only in fine - tuned situations ( e.g. completely homogeneous systems ) can be addressed via global conserved quantities like eq .  .",
    "from a practical point of view , one can envision to define @xmath185 through the long - time dynamics of a local observable sitting at the junction .",
    "if the stationary state is thermal - like , all local observables should agree with the thermal expectation value in the long - time regime .",
    "in this work we studied energy transport between two ( ideally ) semi - infinite xxz chains characterised by different coupling constants .",
    "the _ partitioning _ protocol considered here is identical to the one discussed in several papers recently appeared in the literature : the two half - chains are initially prepared in two separate thermal states and kept at different temperature .",
    "the chains are then connected , the system is let unitarily evolve and the energy current flowing through the system is analysed as a function of time .",
    "most of the paper is devoted to the case where each half - chain has uniform couplings ; there is , however , a difference in their value between the left and right halves .",
    "each half - chain is integrable , the whole system is not .",
    "this setup allowed us to study in details the scattering mechanisms regulating the energy flow in the system , as well as their relation to the integrability of the underlying model and to its conservation laws . in order to dwell more into the scattering of bosonic modes and quasi - particles at the junction",
    ", we also considered a situation in which the couplings are ( adiabatically ) varied through a finite region .",
    "the results that we presented are obtained both with a bosonisation approach and with numerical simulations based on time - dependent matrix product states .",
    "the general scenario that emerges is quite rich including a pre - thermalisation regime and a final thermalisation .",
    "since integrability is only locally broken in this model , a pre - equilibration behaviour may appear .",
    "in particular , when the sound velocities of the bosonic modes of the two halves match , the low - temperature energy current is almost stationary and is described by a formula with a non - universal prefactor interpreted as a transmission coefficient .",
    "thermalisation , characterised by the absence of any energy flow , occurs only on longer time - scales which are not accessible with our numerics .",
    "quite interesting in this respect would be the investigation of the transition between the pre - equilibration and the asymptotic long - time regime : what is the typical time - scale of the thermalisation onset ?",
    "how does it depend on the system parameters and on the initial temperatures ?",
    "another attractive direction would be the development of an analytical approach to this problem at high temperatures where the results obtained exploiting the low - energy field - theory are not reliable .",

    ". in principle one has the freedom to choose the hamiltonian @xmath282 under which the ancilla evolves , but it turns out that the careful choice @xmath283 is fundamental to reach sufficiently long times  @xcite .    in all the data that we show , the bond link is @xmath284 and the system size is such that , for the times explored , the dynamics does is not affected by the boundaries ( we always simulate finite systems with open boundary conditions ) .    as mentioned in the main text , the bond link @xmath130 needed to faithfully represent the state of the system increases exponentially in time because of the spreading of the correlations . since a larger bond link means a larger computational time to evolve of a time - step , in order to reach sufficiently long times we have to fix an upper bound @xmath261 to the bond link value .",
    "this means that , after a certain time @xmath262 , we start to approximate the _ real _ state of the system by _ truncating _ the bond link dimension to @xmath261 ( note that the tebd procedure already introduces an error in the representation of the time - evolved wavefunction ) .    the operative way that we use in order to keep such approximation under control is to check the expectation value of the observables in which we are interested .",
    "for example , given @xmath261 , if for @xmath285 the expectation value of the energy current operator   ( approximately ) does not change as the bond link dimension is increased beyond @xmath261 , we can conclude that the correlations we are neglecting with our approximate representation are not relevant to describe the observable .",
    "this heuristic method is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_approx ] . the energy current as a function of time ( for typical values of the parameters ) is plotted for different values of @xmath261 , as indicated in the legend . at a first glance",
    ", we note that the data in the main panel almost overlap .",
    "this is confirmed by the magnification shown in the inset . to be more quantitative , at @xmath286 ( the common largest time explored ) , the relative difference between the data with @xmath287 and @xmath288 is about @xmath289 , while it is @xmath290 between the data with @xmath291 and @xmath288 .",
