    "the gluon distribution in the proton is relatively well - constrained at small  ( @xmath40.1 ) by deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) data , but less so at larger  @xcite .",
    "consequently , direct - photon data from fixed - target experiments that have been incorporated in several modern global parton distribution function analyses can , in principle , provide a major constraint on the gluon content at moderate to large   @xcite .    however , a pattern of deviations between the measured direct - photon cross sections and nlo calculations has been observed @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is particularly striking in the recently published higher - statistics data from e706 experiment @xcite .",
    "e706 observed large deviations between nlo calculations and data , for both direct - photon and @xmath5 inclusive cross sections .",
    "the final direct - photon results from ua6 @xcite also exhibit evidence of similar , although smaller , discrepancies .",
    "the suspected origin of the disagreements is from effects of initial - state soft - gluon radiation .",
    "such radiation generates transverse components of initial - state parton momenta , referred to in this discussion as @xmath6 . to be precise , as in @xcite ,  denotes the magnitude of the effective transverse momentum vector , @xmath7 , of each of the two colliding partons .",

    "( from these data , one can infer that the average @xmath6 per parton is about 1 gev/@xmath12 at fixed - target energies , increasing to 34 gev/@xmath12 at the tevatron collider .",

    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) corrections at nlo level are also insufficient to explain the size of the observed effects , and full resummation calculations are required to describe dy and w / z @xcite , and diphoton @xcite distributions .",
    "values of  for dy and diphoton data exhibit similar trends versus energy ; for dy data , pion - beam values are somewhat larger than those for proton beams at the same @xmath8 . the dijet data hint at somewhat larger values of than dy results at the same energy , a difference that may be related to different color - flow between initial and final states in dy and in dijet events , as well as to a larger contribution from gluon - induced subprocesses for dijet production",
    ". similar soft - gluon ( or ) effects are expected to be present in all hard - scattering processes , such as the inclusive production of jets or direct photons @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a phenomenological model for @xmath13 effects in direct - photon production and , by extension , in all hard - scattering processes .",
    "quantitative comparisons of this model with data from e706 have been reported previously @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the successes and uncertainties of this prescription , as well as the implications for determining the gluon distribution .",
    "we now briefly describe the theoretical underpinnings of  effects using the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) formalism @xcite . in this formalism , the  spectrum in hard - scattering processes is written as the convolution of the parton distributions @xmath14 , the @xmath15 functions ( representing the finite pieces of the virtual corrections ) , and two sudakov form factors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath16 can be regarded as being perturbative in character and @xmath17 as non - perturbative .",

    "the non - perturbative sudakov form factor is determined from a fit to the data , is expected to be universal ( for a given parton flavor and hadron type ) , and is usually parameterized as a gaussian distribution .",
    "the dividing line between the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions is somewhat arbitrary ( similar to the better known cases of parton distributions and fragmentation functions ) , and it is quantified by a theoretical scale in the resummation formalism . the @xmath18 distribution ( e.g. , of the drell - yan pair ) can be written symbolically as @xmath19        + y.    \\label { }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath20 function is added to ensure a smooth matching between the low and the high-@xmath21 regions , where the resummed and the fixed - order descriptions work better , respectively .    at collider energies ,",
    "most of the @xmath13 can be attributed to perturbative soft - gluon emission . however , for fixed - target kinematics , almost all of the @xmath13 is due to the non - perturbative mechanisms .",
    "a proper treatment requires both the appropriate data to determine the non - perturbative input , and an implementation of the soft - gluon resummation formalism for the particular process .",
    "the resummation calculation for multiple soft - gluon emission in direct - photon production is quite challenging .",
    "the production rate and kinematic distributions of photon pairs produced in hadron interactions have already been calculated @xcite , and a similar calculation of the transverse momentum distribution of a photon - jet system is also plausible , but more involved , since the final - state parton takes part in soft - gluon emission and in color exchange with the initial - state partons . a recent work on this subject @xcite addressed only the effects of multiple soft - gluon radiation in the initial state .",
    "incorporating jet definition in the formalism is also not a fully resolved issue . finally , the calculation of individual transverse momenta of the photon and the jet is further complicated by the fact that several overlapping power - suppressed corrections can contribute . in the absence of the full resummed calculation ,",
    "approximations are made in order to compare theory with data .    in lieu of a rigorous calculation of the resummed @xmath21 distribution , effects of soft - gluon radiation",
    "can be approximated by a convolution of the leading - order cross section with a @xmath6-smearing function @xcite . in the formalism described above ,",
    "this is equivalent to absorbing all of the perturbative gluon emissions into the non - perturbative sudakov form factor .",
    "since no explicit resummation of soft - gluon emissions is performed , the average value of @xmath6 used in the smearing should be representative of the value observed ( or expected ) in the kinematic regime of the experiment .",
    "the expression for the leading - order ( lo ) cross section for direct - photon production at large  has the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the hard - scattering matrix element , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) for the colliding partons @xmath26 and @xmath27 in hadrons @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . to introduce @xmath13 degrees of freedom ,",

    "is usually taken to be a gaussian , @xmath32 where  is the square of the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) rms width of the @xmath6 distribution for one parton ( @xmath33 ) , and is related to the square of the 2d average of the absolute value of @xmath7 of one parton through  = 4@xmath34 .",
    "we emphasize that  represents the average effective 2d transverse momentum per parton .",
    "( the average transverse momentum of the parton pair is , of course , a factor of @xmath10 larger than the average transverse momentum per parton . )",

    "it is straightforward to evaluate the invariant cross sections , including @xmath6 effects , according to the above prescription . in general , because the unmodified pqcd cross sections fall rapidly with increasing , the net effect of the  smearing is to increase the yield .",
    "we denote the enhancement factor as @xmath39 .",
    "since the invariant cross section for direct - photon production is now a six - dimensional integral , it is convenient to employ monte carlo techniques in the evaluation of @xmath39 .",
    "an exact treatment of the kinematics can be implemented in a monte carlo framework , but it is more difficult in an analytic approach .    a monte carlo program that includes such a treatment of @xmath6 smearing , and the leading - order cross section for high-  particle production , has long been available @xcite .",
    "the program provides calculations of many experimental observables , in addition to inclusive cross sections .",
    "the program can be used for direct photons , jets , and for single high-  particles resulting from jet fragmentation ( such as inclusive @xmath11 production ) .",
    "unfortunately , no such program is available for nlo calculations , but one can approximate the effect of  smearing by multiplying the nlo cross sections by the lo @xmath6-enhancement factor . admittedly , this procedure involves a risk of double - counting since some of the @xmath6-enhancement may already be contained in the nlo calculation .",
    "however , such double - counting effects are expected to be small , and consequently this uncertainty on @xmath39 should also be small .",
    "( for example , the nlo estimate for  of the diphoton pairs produced in @xmath40 at @xmath8 = 31.5 gev is on the order of a few hundred mev/@xmath12 , while the resummed prediction is well over 1 gev/@xmath12 @xcite . )",
    "it is clear that this type of treatment of @xmath13 effects is model dependent . in particular",
    ", different functional forms can lead to quantitatively different answers .",
    "for example , adding substantial non - gaussian tails in  smearing can affect the output distributions .",
    "one of the strengths of the approach we follow in this paper is that the @xmath6 distribution used in the smearing is based on experimental information , and the gaussian character of the @xmath6 effects is consistent with the data observed by e706 @xcite .",
    "moreover , any non - gaussian tails may result primarily from single hard - gluon emission , and such contributions should therefore already be contained in the nlo cross sections used in this analysis .",
    "a complete treatment of soft - gluon radiation in high - production , including the appropriate non - perturbative input , should eventually predict the effective @xmath6 values expected for each process and . we will employ  values representative of the kinematic distributions in the data , and based on comparisons with the same model as used to modify the nlo inclusive cross sections .",
    "the effects of soft - gluon radiation are also included in qcd monte carlo programs such as pythia @xcite , isajet @xcite , and herwig @xcite .",
    "however , in these programs the emission is normally cut off at a relatively high parton virtuality , with the remaining @xmath6 effect supplied by a gaussian smearing similar to that discussed above . for fixed - target energies ,",
    "essentially all of the @xmath6 effects are provided by this phenomenological gaussian term .",
    "the above programs differ in the details of the way parton energy and momentum are rescaled after @xmath6 is inserted , which can also produce quantitative differences in results .",
    "the experimental consequences of  smearing are expected to depend on the collision energy . at the tevatron collider ,",
    "the smallest photon @xmath21 values probed by the cdf and  experiments are rather large ( 1015 gev/@xmath12 ) , and the -enhancement factors modify only the very lowest end of the  spectrum , where @xmath21 is not significantly larger than . in the energy range of the e706 measurements",
    ", large -effects can modify both the normalizations and the shapes of the cross sections as functions of .",
    "consequently , e706 data provide a particularly sensitive test of the  model . at lower fixed - target energies ,",
    "the  enhancements are expected to have less  dependence over the range of available measurements , and can therefore be masked more easily by uncertainties in experimental normalizations and/or choices of theoretical scales .",
    "nonetheless , the ua6 and wa70 data generally support the expectations from  smearing .      at the tevatron collider ,",
    "the above model of soft - gluon radiation leads to a relatively simple modification of the nlo cross section . in fig .",

    "consider the production of a photon and a jet with equal and opposite @xmath18 values ( for example , 4 gev/@xmath12 ) close to 90 degrees in the center of mass .",
    "compare this to the situation when the colliding partons impart some amount of @xmath6 , say 1 gev/@xmath12 , in the direction of the photon .",
    "the photon @xmath21 is now 4.5 gev/@xmath12 , and the jet @xmath21 becomes 3.5 gev/@xmath12 ( in the opposite direction ) , resulting from a total of 1 gev/@xmath12 of @xmath6 imparted to the photon+jet system .",
    "thus , the photon itself only receives half of the partonic total .",
    "this factor of two is critical , and can be easily overlooked , in calculating @xmath13 smearing using analytic methods .",
    "the above conclusions have been verified within the explicit monte carlo treatment of event kinematics .",
    "( the convolution formulae for @xmath13 smearing are discussed more fully in the appendix . )    recently , the mrst group has produced a new set of parton distributions , incorporating @xmath6 effects in their analysis of the wa70 and e706 direct - photon data @xcite ; they used an analytic smearing technique rather than a monte carlo approach .",
    "the correction algorithm differs in detail with the one discussed above , and seems to require a significantly smaller  to describe the data ( about 0.65 gev/@xmath12 per incoming parton as compared to 1.2 gev/@xmath12 that was used for e706 at @xmath8 = 31.6 gev ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to a difference in the interpretation of that is related to the factor of two present in eq .",
    "[ eq : inclsmear ] .",
    "if we reinterpret the @xmath68 of 0.65 gev/@xmath12 as our 1.3 gev/@xmath12 per parton , then agreement is restored . nevertheless , the @xmath6-enhancement factors differ somewhat in the two techniques , leading to different conclusions about the gluon distribution , especially at large @xmath69 ( see next section ) . for comparison ,",
    "the mrst @xmath6 factor for e706 ( at @xmath8 = 31.6 gev ) has also been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : propagator ] ; it is similar in size to our calculations for  values in the range of 1.21.4 gev/@xmath12 , but has a different shape in . until these differences are understood",
    ", we must assume that there is a significant shape - dependent uncertainty associated with the particular assumptions used for modeling  effects .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the uncertainty in the gluon distribution at large  is still quite large .",
    "thus , it would appear important to incorporate further constraints on the gluon , especially from direct - photon data . in the following ,",
    "we describe a global pdf fit that employs our  model in the analysis of e706 direct - photon measurements .",
    "since jet production at the tevatron collider is another available constraint for the gluon content at large , we discuss the consistency between the e706 direct - photon results and the cteq4hj gluon distribution ( derived using high-@xmath21 jet data from cdf ) @xcite .      to investigate the impact of  effects on determinations of the gluon distribution , we have included the e706 direct - photon cross sections for incident protons , along with the dis and dy data that were used in determining the cteq4 m pdfs , in a global fit to the parton distribution functions .",
    "the cteq fitting program was employed to obtain these results @xcite , using the nlo pqcd calculations for direct - photon cross sections , adjusted by the @xmath6-enhancement factors .",
    "however , the wa70 , ua6 , cdf , and  data were excluded from this particular fit . the resulting gluon distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluons ] , is similar to cteq4 m , as might have been expected , since the @xmath6-enhanced nlo cross sections using cteq4 m provide a reasonable description of the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xs530 ] and  [ fig : xs800 ] .",
    "the data sets used in determining cteq4 m did not include the e706 direct - photon cross sections , but did use earlier direct - photon data from ua6 and from wa70 ( without @xmath13 corrections ) , along with the inclusive jet cross sections from cdf and  @xcite .",
    "the jet cross sections were particularly useful for defining the gluon distribution in cteq4 m at moderate values of .",
    "-1.cm    the new mrst gluon distribution ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluons ] ) is significantly lower than cteq4 m ( and mrsr2 ) at large . while the mrst fit employs  enhancements , it attempts to accommodate the wa70 incident - proton direct - photon data , which does not exhibit an obvious  effect .",
    "in addition , the mrst -enhancement factors are larger at large  than our corresponding results , resulting in a smaller gluon at large .",
    "this further serves to illustrate the extent to which the extracted gluon distribution is affected by the specific procedures applied in the fit . in contrast",
    ", the cteq4hj specialized gluon distribution ( discussed in more detail in the next subsection ) is much larger than cteq4 m in the same  range .",
    "the current spread of the solutions for the gluon distribution at large  is uncomfortably large , and additional effort is required to resolve these discrepancies .      as presented above ,",
    "when analyzed with @xmath13-enhancement factors , the e706 direct - photon data lead to a gluon distribution similar to that in cteq4 m .",
    "the implications for the size of the gluon at large  are especially important because of the excess observed by cdf in the high-@xmath21 inclusive jet cross section ( when compared to calculations using conventional pdfs ) .",
    "the cteq collaboration produced a global fit ( cteq4hj ) @xcite to improve the description of the high-@xmath18 jet data from cdf in run ia @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath18 data points were given an enhanced weight to emphasize them in that fit .",
    "the resulting cteq4hj parton distributions produce a jet cross section that by design follows the cdf data points more closely than the cross section obtained using cteq4 m .",
    "the cdf inclusive jet cross section from run ib @xcite demonstrates an excess at high @xmath21 similar to that observed in run ia . for ,",
    "the inclusive jet cross section from run ia+ib is consistent with the nlo qcd calculation using conventional parton distributions such as cteq4 m , but can also be well - described with calculations using the cteq4hj parton distribution functions ; in fact , calculations using cteq4hj result in better @xmath70 agreement with the  jet data @xcite .",
    "= 17.5 cm    = 17.5 cm    the cteq4hj quark distributions are similar to those obtained in a more standard fit ( as for example cteq4 m ) , since the dis and dy data provide significant constraints on the quark distributions over all ( and on the gluon distribution at small ) @xcite .",
    "however , the cteq4hj gluon distribution is significantly larger at high  than that of cteq4 m , by a factor of 1.5 at  = 0.5 ( for @xmath71 = 5 gev/@xmath12 ) , and by a factor of 5 at  = 0.7 .    because of the dominance of the @xmath72 scattering subprocess in the tevatron jet cross sections at high @xmath18 , a large change in the gluon distribution is required to generate a relatively small change in the jet cross section . as the cteq exercise has demonstrated , until the theoretical issues related to interpretation of direct - photon data are resolved , there is freedom within the data sets used in the global fits to change the gluon distribution in this way .",
    "it should also be noted that a recent analysis @xcite of deuteron and proton structure functions , using corrections for nuclear binding effects in the deuteron , suggests that the down - quark distribution in the nucleon at large  may be significantly larger than previously assumed ; clearly this also influences the calculated cross sections for the high-@xmath18 jet production .",
    "the cteq4hj gluon distribution is compared to those from cteq4 m , mrst , and the fits including the e706 data in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluons ] . figures  [ fig : xs530hj ] and  [ fig : xs800hj ] show comparisons of the e706 direct - photon cross sections and the nlo calculations using the cteq4hj parton distributions , with and without the @xmath6-enhancement factor .",
    "the shape in  of these calculations appears less consistent with the data than the corresponding results using the cteq4 m gluon .",
    "however , current uncertainties in the understanding of  effects in direct - photon production ( discussed in the previous section ) , preclude an unambiguous interpretation of this difference .",
    "we have described a phenomenological model for  effects in which  values used in the calculations of -enhancement factors are derived from data . despite uncertainties ,",
    "the results are remarkably successful in reconciling the data and theoretical calculations for a broad range of energies .",
    "the -enhancement factors improve the agreement of qcd calculations with e706 , ua6 , and @xmath45 beam wa70 direct - photon cross sections over the full  range of measurements , and at the low-@xmath21 end of cdf and  results .",
    "all fixed - target @xmath11 measurements also agree much better with such -enhanced calculations .",
    "the proper treatment of soft - gluon radiation in direct - photon cross sections can affect the extraction of the gluon distribution , especially at large values of . in this particular treatment of   enhancement ,",
    "the e706 data , which span the widest -range of any direct - photon experiment , are in better agreement with the gluon distribution from cteq4 m than from cteq4hj . however , within the phenomenological approach , any physical mechanism which gives rise to less enhancement at large  than our specific model calculation can make the cteq4hj gluon more consistent with the e706 data .",
    "a definitive conclusion regarding the quantitative role of @xmath6 effects in hard scattering , and reliable additional information on the large-  gluon distribution , awaits more complete theoretical calculations .",
    "the new generation of direct - photon and inclusive jet measurements serves as a strong impetus , and provides a testing ground , for new theoretical developments , perhaps incorporating both  and large-   resummation , which will have less model dependence than the formulations discussed in this paper . further progress built on",
    "this interplay between theory and experiment will allow a more definitive determination of the gluon distribution , especially in the large-  region , where significant uncertainties still remain .",
