    "the dynamical properties of classical coulomb systems change considerably when external magnetic fields are applied .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of large - scale collective modes is strongly influenced by such fields . whereas the modes associated to the longitudinal and the transverse degrees of freedom may be excited independently in an unmagnetized system ,",
    "these degrees of freedom get coupled when a magnetic field is switched on , at least for modes propagating in an oblique direction with respect to the magnetic field . as a consequence , both the well - known plasma oscillations and the viscous modes",
    "get mixed when the isotropy of the system is lost by applying a magnetic field .",
    "the influence of magnetic fields on the mode spectrum of coulomb systems has been studied in several model systems . for the one - component plasma model ( ocp ) , which consists of charged particles moving through an inert neutralizing background of opposite charge ,",
    "the changes in the mode spectrum have been studied by means of magnetohydrodynamics @xcite and in the framework of formal kinetic theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "since the dynamics of the magnetized ocp model has an anomaly that is caused by a divergency in the heat conductivity @xcite , a full treatment of the effects of a magnetic field on the mode spectrum calls for a somewhat more general model . the multicomponent ionic mixture ( mim ) in a magnetic field is quite useful in this respect @xcite .",
    "in the magnetized mim model several species of charged particles are present . if the charge - mass ratios of the particles are not all equal , the anomalous behaviour of the heat transport is no longer present , as has been shown in ref .  @xcite . in that paper",
    "the modes of the magnetized mim have been studied by formal kinetic theory .",
    "more recently @xcite , a magnetohydrodynamical approach has been used to determine the influence of the magnetic field on the modes .",
    "the results were found to corroborate those found in @xcite . in the long - wavelength limit",
    "the spectrum of collective modes consists of four oscillating modes with a non - vanishing frequency , and of a set of coupled heat and diffusion modes with frequencies tending to 0 for vanishing wave number . by including terms of higher order in the wave number",
    ", the latter modes could be discerned .",
    "the second - order terms in the mode frequencies describe damping that is caused by dissipative transport phenomena .    in ref",
    ".  @xcite and @xcite the mode frequencies of the oscillating modes have been obtained in the limit of vanishing wave number only .",
    "hence , dispersion effects for these modes could not be studied .",
    "furthermore , damping effects that are of second order in the wave number were not treated either . in the present paper",
    "we wish to fill this gap by evaluating the second - order contributions to the oscillating - mode frequencies in a systematic way .    as in our previous paper @xcite we shall use both a magnetohydrodynamical approach and formal kinetic theory .",
    "interestingly enough , it turns out that standard magnetohydrodynamics is not enough to determine the frequencies of the oscillating modes in second order of the wave number .",
    "as we will show , so - called burnett terms will be needed to obtain a consistent picture . for systems of neutral particles",
    "these burnett terms @xcite@xcite , which describe non - local effects in transport phenomena , are of rather limited importance .",
    "they play a role only when one is interested in contributions to mode frequencies that are of higher than second order in the wave number . for charged - particle systems",
    ", however , the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction leads to a reshuffling of terms in the magnetohydrodynamical equations , which enhances the relevance of the burnett contributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "the conservation laws and the balance equations of linearized magnetohydrodynamics for the magnetized mim model are formulated .",
    "the linear phenomenological laws relating thermodynamic forces and flows are presented . in particular , the burnett contributions will be written down explicitly .",
    "the fourier - transformed versions of these magnetohydrodynamical equations are given in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the next two sections contain the analysis that leads to our main result , namely the eigenfrequencies of the oscillating modes up to second order in the wavelength . in sections",
    "[ sec6 ] and [ sec7 ] a kinetic approach is used to rederive these frequencies and to obtain the kinetic equivalents of the transport coefficients , both in leading order and in the higher - order burnett regime .",
    "a few auxiliary thermodynamical relations and the basic formalism of the kinetic eigenvalue problem are presented in two appendices .",
    "[ sec2 ] an ionic mixture consists of several species of charged particles ( with charges of the same sign ) , which move in an inert uniform neutralizing background . if a uniform external magnetostatic field is present as well , the motion of each of the particles is governed by the electrostatic forces from the other particles and from the background , and by the lorentz force due to the external field .",
    "we assume that the motion of the particles is so slow that the magnetic fields generated by them can be disregarded .    in thermal equilibrium",
    "the particle density @xmath2 of species @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) is uniform and time - independent .",
    "the total charge density @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 the charge of a particle of species @xmath3 ) is matched by the background charge density @xmath7 .",
    "the total mass density @xmath8 follows as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the mass of a particle of species @xmath3 .",
    "if equilibrium is slightly perturbed , the particle densities acquire deviations @xmath11 that in general are non - uniform and time - dependent .",
    "moreover , each species in the perturbed system will get a non - uniform and time - dependent velocity @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we assume that the perturbations vary slowly in space and time .",
    "the characteristic length @xmath13 of the spatial variations should be large compared to the average interparticle distance @xmath14 , for all @xmath3 . the characteristic time for temporal variations",
    "should be large compared to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the velocity of light .",
    "the continuity equation for species @xmath3 reads in first order of the perturbations @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the barycentric velocity and @xmath19 $ ] the diffusion flow of species @xmath3 with respect to the barycentric motion .",
    "these flows satisfy the identity @xmath20 . upon multiplying by @xmath6 and summing over @xmath3",
    "we get the conservation law for the total charge : @xmath21 as an independent set we will choose ( [ 2.2 ] ) in combination with ( [ 2.1 ] ) for @xmath22 .",
    "the time dependence of the barycentric motion is given by the equation of motion , which up to first order in the perturbations reads @xcite : @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ + c^{-1 } \\sum_{\\sigma(\\neq 1)}\\left(\\frac{e_{\\sigma}}{m_{\\sigma}}- \\frac{e_1}{m_1}\\right)\\bi{j}_{\\sigma}(\\bi{r},t)\\wedge\\bi{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 is the perturbation of the ( local ) equilibrium pressure , while @xmath25 is the viscous pressure tensor .",
    "the electric field is determined by @xmath26 through gauss s law @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 is the uniform external magnetostatic field .",
    "the perturbation @xmath29 of the internal energy density satisfies a balance equation , which gets the form of a conservation law when only terms up to first order in the perturbations are taken into account : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the enthalpy per volume , with @xmath32 the ( uniform ) equilibrium internal energy density and @xmath33 the equilibrium pressure .",
    "furthermore @xmath34 is the heat flow .",
    "the conservation laws and the equation of motion contain the heat flow @xmath34 , the diffusion flows @xmath35 and the viscous pressure tensor @xmath25 .",
    "these quantities can be expressed in terms of thermodynamic forces by means of phenomenological relations @xcite .",
    "the forces that drive the heat flow and the diffusion flows are @xcite @xmath36_t   + \\frac{1}{t}\\left(\\frac{e_{\\sigma}}{m_{\\sigma}}-\\frac{e_1}{m_1}\\right ) ( \\bi{e}+\\frac{1}{c}\\bi{v}\\wedge\\bi{b})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subscript @xmath37 indicates that the gradients of the chemical potentials @xmath38 have to be taken at constant temperature @xmath39 .    in the standard formalism of non - equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "the diffusion flows are written as linear combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 the phenomenological coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are anisotropic tensors of second rank .    the modified heat flow @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the partial specific enthalpy per particle , is a linear combination of the thermodynamic forces @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath47 as a consequence , the heat flow @xmath34 itself gets the form @xcite : @xmath48 with the tensorial coefficients @xmath49 the tensors @xmath50 satisfy the onsager relations : @xmath51 similar relations hold for @xmath52 .",
    "finally , in standard non - equilibrium thermodynamics the viscous pressure tensor is proportional to the thermodynamic force @xmath53 : @xmath54 the symbol @xmath55 denotes a double contraction , so that the @xmath56-component of the right - hand side is @xmath57 .",
    "the components of the fourth - rank anisotropic viscosity tensor @xmath58 satisfy the onsager relations : @xmath59 furthermore , @xmath60 is symmetric in @xmath56 and in @xmath61 .    for neutral - particle systems the above phenomenological relations are sufficiently general to determine the damping and dispersion of the collective modes up to second order in the wave number .",
    "however , for a system of charged particles this need not be true any longer , at least when various species of particles are present . whereas the conventional phenomenological relations are still adequate to determine the modes of the ocp model @xcite@xcite , the standard formalism has to be generalized for the case of the mim model . for that system",
    "the damping and dispersion of the diffusion and heat modes up to second order in the wave number are correctly found by inserting the above phenomenological relation in the balance equations , as shown in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , one has to include burnett terms with higher - order gradient operators in the phenomenological relations in order to determine the damping and dispersion of the oscillating modes up to second order in the wave number .",
    "the relevance of higher - order burnett terms becomes obvious upon inspecting the charge conservation law .",
    "when ( [ 2.7 ] ) with ( [ 2.6 ] ) is substituted in the last term of ( [ 2.2 ] ) , the divergence of the diffusion flow @xmath35 leads to a spatial derivative of the electric field .",
    "the long - range nature of the coulomb field implies that such a derivative does not necessarily yield a contribution of first order in the wavenumber in fourier language .",
    "in fact , from gauss s law it follows that the spatial derivative of the electric field is proportional to @xmath26 itself , so that it is of the same order in the wave number as the left - hand side of ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "hence , if one wishes to determine all contributions to the oscillating - mode frequencies up to second order in the wavenumber , one has to go further than the standard linear law ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the equation of motion ( [ 2.3 ] ) , of which the last term is proportional to the diffusion flows . according to ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] )",
    "the latter contain electrodynamic terms without gradient operators , so that in fourier language terms appear that are of less than first order in the wavenumber .    from both these arguments",
    "it becomes clear that in order to determine the damping and dispersion of the collective modes up to second order in the wave number one is forced to generalize the phenomenological expression for the diffusion flow by including burnett terms of higher order in the gradients . by invoking parity invariance",
    "one finds the following general form of the diffusion flow up to second order in the gradients : @xmath62 with the generalized thermodynamic forces : @xmath63 both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are fourth - rank tensors , with the following symmetry properties : @xmath66 is symmetric in @xmath67 , while @xmath68 is symmetric in its last three indices @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath64 has the onsager symmetry : @xmath70 the symbol @xmath71 in ( [ 2.15 ] ) indicates a triple contraction ; the @xmath72-component of the last term , for instance , is @xmath73 .    according to ( [ 2.15 ] ) with ( [ 2.17 ] ) , the diffusion flow depends on the gradient of the thermodynamic force @xmath74 . likewise , the viscous pressure gets coupled to the gradient of the force @xmath41 when higher - order terms in the gradients are included : @xmath75 with the generalized thermodynamic force @xmath76 and a fourth - tank tensorial coefficient @xmath77 . it is related to @xmath65 by the onsager relation @xmath78 which is similar to ( [ 2.18 ] ) . as a consequence , @xmath79 is symmetric in @xmath80 .",
    "the generalized phenomenological relations ( [ 2.15 ] ) and ( [ 2.19 ] ) contain terms with higher - order gradients of the charge density @xmath81 and the barycentric velocity @xmath82 .",
    "these terms represent non - local effects in the phenomenological relations .",
    "clearly , the diffusion flow and the viscous pressure at a certain position are partly determined by the charge density and the velocity in the neighbourhood of that position .",
    "the relevance of such non - local effects need not surprise for an ionic mixture in which long - range interparticle interactions are present .",
    "to determine the properties of the collective modes we need the fourier transforms of the balance equations .",
    "the fourier transform of the particle conservation law ( [ 2.1 ] ) follows upon substitution of ( [ 2.15 ] ) , with ( [ 2.5 ] ) , ( [ 2.6 ] ) , ( [ 2.16 ] ) and ( [ 2.17 ] ) . up",
    "to second order in the wave number we get @xmath83 here @xmath84 is a unit vector in the direction of the wave vector .",
    "furthermore , we introduced the following combination of phenomenological coefficients : @xmath85 the ratio of the plasma frequency @xmath86 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath87 is denoted as @xmath88 . as a consequence of the long range of the coulomb interactions , large - scale charge perturbations",
    "are suppressed effectively .",
    "in fact , one may prove @xcite that in thermal equilibrium the fourier - transformed fluctuations @xmath26 are proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "for that reason , the ` reduced ' charge - density perturbation @xmath89 will be treated as being of order @xmath90 .",
    "it should be noted that upon adopting this convention all contributions from the generalized thermodynamic forces in ( [ 2.15 ] ) drop out from ( [ 3.1 ] ) , as these become of higher than second order in the wave number .",
    "the fourier transform of the charge conservation law ( [ 2.2 ] ) is derived in a similar way . dividing the conservation law by @xmath0",
    "so as to obtain the time derivative of @xmath89 , we see that the terms with the generalized thermodynamic forces in ( [ 2.15 ] ) contribute in second order of the wave number .",

    "we have derived explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the oscillating modes up to second order . since the second - order contributions to the frequencies determine the damping and the dispersion of the collective modes , our results give useful information on the dynamical behaviour of ionic mixtures .",
    "as we have seen , the damping and dispersion phenomena are governed by dissipative mechanisms that go beyond those of standard non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , the well - known phenomenological laws for the diffusive flows and the viscous pressure are not sufficient to account for the full effects of dispersion and damping of the oscillating modes . whereas the dissipation implied by these standard laws yields the damping and dispersion of the heat mode and the diffusion modes ,",
    "as shown in our previous paper @xcite , we had to generalize the standard laws by including higher - order burnett terms in order to get a complete picture of the damping and the dispersion of the oscillating modes up to second - order in the wave number .",
    "burnett terms have been discussed previously in the context of systems of neutral particles @xcite@xcite . for such systems",
    "the burnett terms generally lead to small effects in the dynamical behaviour , so that they can usually be neglected . in the present case of an ionic mixture that is no longer true : in a systematic treatment of the collective modes the burnett terms can not be disregarded .",
    "the technical reason for the necessity to incorporate burnett terms when investigating the dynamics of an ionic mixture turns out to be the long - range nature of the coulomb interactions . in an ionic mixture",
    "the long - range electric fields generated by charge fluctuations are driving agents in the thermodynamical forces .",
    "these electric fields lead to terms of zeroth order in the wavenumber after fourier transformation . to be consistent up to second order in the wavenumber one has to include terms with gradients of the electric field in the thermodynamic forces .",
    "hence the phenomenological laws , which connect these thermodynamical forces to the thermodynamic flows , must be used in a form which accounts for such field gradient terms .",
    "we have to conclude that burnett terms can not be neglected in systems with long - range forces .",
