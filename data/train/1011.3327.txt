    "ecologists increasingly use species distribution models to address theoretical and practical issues , including predicting the response of species to climate change [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , designing and managing conservation areas [ @xcite ] , and finding additional populations of known species or closely related sibling species [ @xcite , @xcite ] . in all these applications",
    "the core problem is to use information about where a species occurs and about relevant environmental factors to predict how likely the species is to be present or absent in unsampled locations .",
    "the literature on species distribution modeling covers many applications ; there are useful review papers that organize and compare model approaches [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "most species distribution models ignore spatial pattern and thus are based implicitly on two assumptions : ( 1 ) environmental factors are the primary determinants of species distributions and ( 2 ) species have reached or nearly reached equilibrium with these factors [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "these assumptions underlie the currently dominant species distribution modeling approaches  generalized linear and additive models ( glm and gam ) , species envelope models such as bioclim [ @xcite ] , and the maximum entropy - based approach maxent [ @xcite ] .",
    "the statistics literature covers glm and gam models extensively .",
    "the latter tends to fit data better than the former since they employ additional parameters but lose simplicity in interpretation and risk overfitting and poor out - of - sample prediction .",
    "climate envelope models and the now increasingly - used maximum entropy methods are algorithmic and not of direct interest here .",
    "in addition to the fundamental ecological issues mentioned above , complication arises in various forms in modeling abundance from imperfect survey data such as observer error [ @xcite , @xcite ] , variable sampling intensity , gaps in sampling , and spatial misalignment of distributional and environmental data [ @xcite ] .",
    "first , since a region is almost never exhaustively sampled , individuals not exposed to sampling will be missed .",
    "second , it may be that potentially present individuals are undetected [ @xcite ] and , possibly vice versa , for example , a false positive misclassification error with regard to species detection [ @xcite ] .",
    "a third complication is that ecologists and field workers are biased against absences ; they tend to sample where species are , not where they are nt .",
    "such _ preferential sampling _ and its impact on inference is discussed in @xcite .",
    "further complications arise with animals due to their mobility .",
    "previous work has developed spatial hierarchical models that accommodate some of these difficulties , fitting these models to presence / absence data in a bayesian framework [ @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] .",
    "the species distribution modeling discussed above is either in the presence / absence or presence - only data settings ; there is relatively little work on spatial abundance patterns , despite their theoretical and practical importance [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "our primary contribution here is to develop a hierarchical modeling approach for ordinal categorical abundance data , explained by the suitability of the environment , the effect of land use / land transformation , and potential misclassification error .",
    "ordinal classifications are often the case in ecological abundance data , especially for plants [ @xcite , @xcite ] . from a stochastic modeling perspective",
    ", categorical data can be viewed as the outcome of a multinomial model , with the cell probabilities dependent on background features . within a bayesian framework such modeling",
    "is often implemented using data augmentation [ @xcite ] , introducing a latent hierarchical level . there",
    ", the ordered classification is viewed as a clipped version of a single _ latent _ continuous response , introducing cut points .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .    at the latent level , suitability of the environment can be modeled through regression .",
    "availability in terms of land use degrades suitability .",
    "that is , an important feature of our modeling , from an ecological point of view , is that it deals with transformation of the study area by human intervention . in much of the region ,",
    "the `` natural '' state of areas has been altered to an agricultural or urban state , or the vegetation has been densely colonized by alien invasive plant species .",
    "so , we can not treat the entire region as equally _",
    "available _ to the plant species we are modeling .",
    "we must introduce a contrast between the current abundance of species ( their _ transformed _ or _ adjusted _ abundance ) and their potential distributions in the absence of land use change ( _ potential _ abundance ) .",
    "these notions are formally defined at the areal unit level in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "a further degradation enabling the possibility of misclassification and/or observer error in the data collection procedure can be accounted for as _ measurement error _ in the latent surface .",
    "there is a substantial literature on measurement error modeling for continuous observations , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in our modeling",
    "we impose a hard constraint : with no potential presence ( i.e. , an unsuitable environment ) , we can observe only zero abundance .",
    "we enforce this constraint on the latent scale . with cut points , modeled as random ,",
    "we provide an explanatory model for the observed categorical abundance data .",
    "furthermore , we can invert from the latent abundance scale to the categorical abundances to predict abundance for unsampled cells and also to predict abundance in the absence of land use transformation .    with spatial data collection",
    ", we anticipate spatial pattern in abundance and thus introduce spatial structure into our modeling .",
    "that is , causal ecological explanations such as localized dispersal , as well as omitted ( unobserved ) explanatory variables with spatial pattern such as local smoothness of geological or topographic features , suggest that , at sufficiently high resolution , abundance of a species at one location will be associated with its abundance at neighboring locations [ @xcite ] . moreover , through spatial modeling , we can provide spatial adjustment to cells that have not been sampled , accommodating the gaps in sampling and irregular sampling intensity mentioned above .",
    "in particular , we create a latent _ process _ model through a trivariate spatial process specification , with truncated support , to capture potential abundance , land transformation - adjusted abundance , and measurement error - adjusted abundance .",
    "since our environmental information is available at grid cell level , we use markov random field ( mrf ) models [ @xcite , @xcite ] to capture spatial dependence and to facilitate computation .",
    "however , we work with a large landscape of approximately @xmath0 grid cells which leads to very long run times in model fitting and so we introduce a novel parallelized computing strategy to expedite fitting .",
    "there have been other recent developments in modeling of species abundances , some using bayesian hierarchical models .",
    "first , there has been some work on developing models that deal almost exclusively with animal census data , including count data and mark - recapture data [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . @xcite",
    "provide an overview of abundance modeling , in fact , five regression models ( poisson , negative binomial , quasi - poisson , the hurdle model , and the zero - inflated poisson ) fitted for one particular plant example .",
    "these models focus on correcting observer error and bias as well as under - detection ( the species is present but not observed ) , whence the `` true '' abundance is virtually always higher than observed [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "we note some very recent work on working with ordinal species abundance in plant data by @xcite .",
    "this approach takes ordinally scored abundances and uses an ordered logit hierarchical bayes model to infer potential abundances for species that are still spreading across the landscape .",
    "the advantages of working within the bayesian framework with markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) model fitting are familiar by now ",
    "full inference about arbitrary unknowns , that is , functions of model parameters and predictions , can be achieved through their posterior distributions , and uncertainty can be quantified exactly rather than through asymptotics . in this application",
    "we work with the disaggregated data at the level of individual species and sites to present spatially resolved abundance `` surfaces '' and to capture uncertainty in model parameters .",
    "doing this turns out to be more difficult than might be expected , as we reveal in our model development section . the key modeling issues center on careful articulation of the definition of events and associated probabilities , the misalignment between the sampling for abundance ( at the relatively small sampling sites ) and the available environmental data layers ( at a scale of minute by minute grid cells , roughly 1.55  km@xmath21.85  km over the region ) , the sparseness of observations in terms of the entire landscape ( with uneven sampling intensity including many `` holes '' ) , the occurrence of considerable human intervention with regard to land use across the landscape ( `` transformation '' ) , and the need for spatially explicit modeling .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] describes the motivating data set .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] develops the multi - level abundance model .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] details the computational and inference issues . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we present an analysis of the data from the cape floristic region ( cfr ) and conclude with some discussion and future extensions in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "the focal area for this abundance study is the cape floristic kingdom or region ( cfr ) , the smallest of the world s six floral kingdoms ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as noted above , it encompasses a small region of southwestern south africa , about 90,000  km@xmath3 , including the cape of good hope , and is partitioned into 36,907 minute - by - minute grid cells of equal area .",
    "it has long been recognized for high levels of plant species diversity and endemism across all spatial scales .",
    "the region includes about 9000 plant species , @xmath4 of which are found nowhere else [ @xcite ] .",
    "globally , this is one of the highest concentrations of endemic plant species in the world .",
    "it is as diverse as many of the world s tropical rain forests and apparently has the highest density of globally endangered plant species [ @xcite ] .",
    "the plant diversity in the cfr is concentrated in relatively few groups , such as the icon flowering plant family of south africa , the proteaceae .",
    "we focus on this family because the data on species distribution and abundance patterns are sufficiently rich and detailed to allow complex modeling .",
    "the proteaceae have also shown a remarkable level of speciation , with about 400 species across africa , of which 330 species are @xmath5 restricted to the cfr .",
    "of those 330 species , at least 152 are listed as `` threatened '' with extinction by the international union for the conservation of nature .",
    "proteaceae have been unusually well sampled across the region by the protea atlas project of the south african national biodiversity institute [ @xcite ] .",
    "data were collected at _ record localities _",
    ": relatively uniform , geo - referenced areas typically 50 to 100 m in diameter . in addition to the presence ( or absence ) at the locality of protea species , abundance of each species",
    "along with selected environmental and species - level information were also tallied [ @xcite ] . to date ,",
    "some 60,000 localities have been recorded ( including null sites ) , with a total of about 250,000 species counts from among some 375 proteas [ @xcite ] .",
    "km@xmath6 region was divided into @xmath7 @xmath8-minute cells for modeling . ]",
    "abundance is given for a sampling locality .",
    "evidently , there is no notion of abundance at a point ; however , with roughly @xmath9 sites sampled over the entire cfr , the relative scale of the protea atlas observations is small enough when compared to our areal units to be considered as `` points . '' in the literature , abundance is sometimes measured as percent cover [ @xcite ] . in our data",
    "set , abundance is recorded as an ordinal categorical classification of the count for the species with four categories : category 0@xmath10 none observed , category 1@xmath10 110 observed , category 2@xmath10 11100 observed , category 3@xmath10 @xmath11100 observed .",
    "such categorization is fast and efficient for studying many species and many sampling locations but is certainly at risk for measurement error in the form of misclassification .",
    "additionally , a large number of cells were not sampled at all .",
    "in fact , only 10,158 , that is , @xmath1 , were sampled at one or more sites .",
    "even among cells sampled , some have just one or two sites while others have more than 100 , reflecting the irregular and opportunistic nature of the sampling rather than an experimentally designed sampling plan .",
    "turning to the covariates , in @xcite ( @xcite ) @xmath12 explanatory environmental variables were studied , capturing climate , soil , and topographic features ( further detail is provided there ) . here ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the six most significant variables from that study , which are evapotranspiration ( apan.mean ) , july ( winter ) minimum temperature ( min07 ) , january ( summer ) maximum temperature ( max01 ) , mean annual precipitation ( mean.an.pr ) , summer soil moisture days ( sumsmd ) , and soil fertility ( fert1 ) .",
    "transformed areas ( by agriculture , reforestation , alien plant infestation , and urbanization ) were obtained as a gis data layer from r. cowling ( private communication ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the pattern of transformation across the cfr .",
    "approximately @xmath13 of the cape has been transformed , mainly in the lowlands on more fertile soils where rainfall is adequate [ @xcite ] .",
    "most of the transformation outside of these areas , on the infertile mountains , is due to dense alien invader species , which are currently a major threat to fynbos vegetation and , in particular , to the proteaceae .",
    "in section  [ subsec31 ] we briefly review the earlier work on hierarchical modeling for presence / absence data , presented in @xcite ( @xcite ) , in order to reveal how we have generalized it for the abundance problem .",
    "section  [ subsec32 ] develops our proposed probability model for the categorical abundance data . in section  [ subsec33 ] discrete probability distributions",
    "are replaced using latent continuous variables . in section  [ subsec34 ]",
    "we discuss bias issues associated with modeling abundance data and , in particular , how they affect our setting .",
    "section  [ subsec35 ] deals with explicit model details for the likelihood and posterior .      in @xcite ( @xcite,@xcite ) the authors model at the scale of the grid cells in the cfr and provide a block averaged binary process presence / absence model at this scale . in particular ,",
    "let @xmath14 denote the geographical region corresponding to the @xmath15th grid cell and @xmath16 the event that a randomly selected location within @xmath17 is suitable ( 1 ) or unsuitable ( 0 ) for species @xmath18 .",
    "set @xmath19 .",
    "then , @xmath20 is conceptualized by letting @xmath21 be a binary process over the region indicating the suitability ( 1 ) or not ( 0 ) of location @xmath22 for species @xmath18 and taking @xmath20 to be the block average of this process over unit @xmath15 .",
    "that is , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the area of @xmath17 . from equation ( [ eq311 ] )",
    ", the interpretation is that the more locations within @xmath17 with @xmath25 , the more suitable @xmath17 is for species @xmath18 , that is , the greater the chance of potential presence in @xmath17 .",
    "the collection of @xmath20 s over the @xmath17 is viewed as the potential distribution of species @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the event that a randomly selected location in @xmath17 is suitable for species @xmath18 in the presence of transformation of the landscape .",
    "let @xmath27 be an indicator process indicating whether location @xmath22 is transformed ( @xmath8 ) or not ( 0 ) .",
    "then , at @xmath22 , both @xmath28 ( availability ) and @xmath25 ( suitability ) are needed in order that location @xmath22 is suitable under transformation .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 if , for each pixel , availability is uncorrelated with suitability , then equation ( [ eq312 ] ) simplifies to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the proportion of area in @xmath17 which is untransformed , @xmath32 .",
    "next , assume that @xmath17 has been visited @xmath33 times in untransformed areas within the cell .",
    "further , let @xmath34 be the observed presence / absence status of the @xmath18th species at the @xmath35th sampling location within the @xmath15th unit .",
    "the @xmath36 are modeled as i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli trials with success probability @xmath37 , that is , for a randomly selected location in @xmath17 , @xmath37 is the probability of species @xmath18 being present given the location is both suitable and available .",
    "of course , given @xmath38 , @xmath39 with probability 1 .",
    "then , we have that @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) model the @xmath20 and @xmath37 using logistic regressions .",
    "in fact , they use environmental variables and spatial random effects to model the @xmath20 s , the probabilities of potential presence , and , to facilitate identifiability of parameters , use species level attributes to model the @xmath37 s .",
    "we first define what _ categorical abundance _ means at an areal scale using the four ordinal categories from section  [ sec2 ] . suppressing the species index ,",
    "let @xmath41 denote the classification for a randomly selected location in @xmath17 and define @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 for @xmath45 . if @xmath46 is a four - colored process taking values @xmath47 , then @xmath48 .",
    "that is , @xmath42 is the proportion of area within @xmath17 with color @xmath49 , equivalently , the proportion in abundance class @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath42 denote the potential abundance probabilities , that is , in the absence of transformation .",
    "we describe land transformation percentage @xmath50 as a block average of a binary availability process @xmath27 over @xmath17 .",
    "it can also be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected site within @xmath17 is transformed . at a transformed location abundance _",
    "must _ be @xmath51 .",
    "thus , as in equation ( [ eq312 ] ) , in the presence of transformation , we revise @xmath42 to @xmath52 . under independence of abundance and land transformation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath53 . the @xmath54 denote the transformed abundance probabilities for @xmath55 .",
    "the probability of abundance class @xmath51 under transformation is evidently @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the abundance class probabilities in the presence of transformation .",
    "finally , suppose there is an observed categorical abundance at location @xmath35 within @xmath17 , say , @xmath58 .",
    "there is an associated conceptual @xmath59 and an observed @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath61 if there has been transformation degradation at location @xmath35 , unless @xmath62 . furthermore , if there has been a misclassification error at @xmath35 , @xmath63 unless @xmath62 . let @xmath64 denote the abundance class probabilities associated with the observed abundances .",
    "in section  [ subsec33 ] we specify a latent trivariate continuous abundance model that produces the @xmath65 s , @xmath66 s , and @xmath67 s by integrating over appropriate intervals .",
    "this latent model can be viewed as the _ process model _ for our setting .    the data set consists of observed abundances across several sampling sites within the cfr .",
    "let @xmath68 denote our cfr study domain so @xmath68 is divided into @xmath69 grid cells of equal area .",
    "for each cell @xmath70 , we are given information on @xmath65 covariates as @xmath71 .",
    "within @xmath17 , the abundance category of a species was recorded at each of @xmath72 sampling sites . for many cells @xmath73 . for site @xmath35 in @xmath17",
    "we observe @xmath58 as a multinomial trial , that is , @xmath74 .",
    "we have a large number of unsampled cells , that is , @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , out of 36,907 cells , only @xmath76 ( @xmath1 ) were sampled at one or more sites .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] indicates locations of sampled cells . for the unsampled cells there are no @xmath58 s in the data set .",
    "hence , the inference problem involves estimation of probabilities over the observed cells as well as _",
    "prediction _ over the unsampled region .",
    "prediction of a categorical response distribution for unsampled locations in a point level model was discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in our areal setup with only areal level @xmath77 s",
    ", we address this problem with a mrf model , as described in section  [ subsec33 ] .",
    "again , we seek to infer about the @xmath65 s , @xmath66 s , and @xmath67 s given the observed @xmath78 s for a subset of cells and @xmath77 s known for all cells .",
    "it is now common to model the probability mass function of a scalar _ ordinal _ categorical variable through an underlying univariate continuous distribution . in a more general setup ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite used latent random vectors to define the categorical probabilities in terms of these vectors taking values within a specific set . in a similar spirit ,",
    "corresponding to an observed abundance category variable @xmath58 , we introduce a continuous latent variable @xmath79 such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 are an increasing sequence of cut points . for identifiability and without loss of generality , we can set @xmath82 and interpret @xmath83 as an absence , @xmath84 as a presence .",
    "we have @xmath85 .",
    "so @xmath64 will be determined by the probability model specified for the @xmath79 s .",
    "we will introduce spatial dependence between @xmath79 s below but , for now , to simplify notation , we drop the subscript .",
    "a simple model would put a gaussian distribution on these latent @xmath86 s whose means are linear functions of the associated @xmath77 s .",
    "this would provide a routine categorical regression model but ignores known land transformation and potential measurement / ecological error in the recorded abundance categories .",
    "instead , we introduce @xmath87 to provide the @xmath88 s and @xmath89 to provide the @xmath90 s . we need a joint distribution to relate the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath86 . from a process perspective in terms of the proposed degradation , it seems natural to specify this distribution in the form @xmath93 . since ( @xmath94 )",
    "capture the sequential degradation of an associated categorical abundance distribution , we need to use the same set of @xmath95 s to produce meaningful ( @xmath96 ) respectively .",
    "now , we propose ( and clarify ) the following dependence structure .",
    "define @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the standard normal p.d.f . and c.d.f .",

    ", we use the covariate information , that is , climate and soil features that are believed to influence the abundance distribution of different species in different ways .",
    "we also add a spatial random effect ( @xmath104 ) in the mean function to account for spatial association that may arise from factors , apart from included covariates , that may have a spatial pattern .",
    "the covariate effects @xmath105 as well as the spatial random effects @xmath104 are species - specific .",
    "variances are fixed at 1 for identifiability ( see section  [ subsec35 ] ) .",
    "since we are working at areal scale , we assign each cell a single @xmath104 with the prior on @xmath106 specified using a gaussian markov random field ( mrf ) [ @xcite ] with first - order adjacency proximities .",
    "see @xcite for details as well as further references .",
    "next , the @xmath107 surface is degraded by land transformation .",
    "a random location inside @xmath17 is untransformed with probability @xmath108 .",
    "then , @xmath109 , that is , a degenerate distribution at @xmath107 given @xmath107 .",
    "if it is transformed , the degradation occurs so that the @xmath110 corresponds to the zero abundance category .",
    "for simplicity ( with further discussion below ) , we make this a degenerate distribution at @xmath111 , whence @xmath112 becomes a two point distribution as above .",
    "again , transformation is equivalent to absence and since @xmath82 is the upper threshold for that classification , we need @xmath113 for a transformed location .",
    "when a cell is completely transformed , from equation ( [ eq331 ] ) we have @xmath113 w.p .",
    "@xmath8 . for @xmath114 ( complete availability ) @xmath110 and @xmath107 are the same . for any @xmath115 , we get @xmath116    also , since @xmath117 , @xmath118 , which is essential in the sense that transformation can only degrade abundance [ and clarifies our choice for @xmath119 .",
    "posterior summaries of @xmath110 measure the prevailing abundance under transformation within the cfr .",
    "[ in appendix  [ a1 ] we show that @xmath120 . ]",
    "the two - point mixture distribution also implies the probability of abundance class @xmath51 , @xmath121 , that is , no matter how large the potential abundance is within a cell , for any @xmath122 there is a positive probability that transformed abundance may fall below @xmath51 at a random location within the cell .",
    "other choices for the @xmath123 specification besides a point mass at @xmath124 include putting a point mass at some arbitrary point @xmath125 , or using a truncated normal @xmath123 on @xmath126 . in the first case",
    ", it is not ensured whether @xmath127 ( it depends on whether there are cells with @xmath128 ) , while the second choice adds complication for no benefit , is less interpretable , and does not ensure @xmath129 with probability @xmath8 . also , in section  [ sec4 ] we show that , in terms of fitting the model , the specification used in equation ( [ eq331 ] ) is the same as using a truncated normal distribution for land transformation .",
    "next , we modify the \\{@xmath92 } surface to produce \\{@xmath86}. with regard to measurement error , the recorded category of abundance at a particular location can be different from the prevailing category due to inaccuracy in field assessment of species quantity .",
    "however , we assume that when the potential abundance was zero , one could not record a nonzero abundance category for it [ no false positives , see @xcite in this regard ] .",
    "this puts a directional constraint on the effect of noise .",
    "a specification for @xmath130 which is coherent with this restriction has , with @xmath131 ( i.e. , a presence ) , @xmath132 .",
    "this is a usual measurement error model ( _ mem _ ) specification .",
    "for a site with no presence @xmath133 , our assumption says there can not be any measurement error , thus , in equation ( [ eq331 ] ) , for simplicity , we set @xmath134 to be the same as @xmath110 . again , other choices of @xmath135 can be considered for the @xmath136 event , but they will not have any impact on estimation of the @xmath107 surface , as we clarify in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "this sequential dependence structure , @xmath137 , implies that if @xmath138 so is @xmath110 and @xmath134 .",
    "hence , if a site is not suitable for a species , at no intermediate stage of the model can the site have any positive probability of species occurrence .",
    "a change in category between _ actual _ and _ observed _ arises when the noise pushes @xmath92 to the other side of some cut point to produce @xmath86 . and , because of the truncation structure",
    ", that shift can not happen from the left of @xmath139 to the right .",
    "an alternative way to jointly model @xmath140 could use a bivariate normal distribution with support truncated to @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "however , this specification fails to produce an @xmath142 which match our intuition about how the degradation took place .",
    "also , from the distributional perspective , the truncated normal redistributes the mass contained inside the left - out region uniformly across the support , whereas the specification in equation ( [ eq331 ] ) shifts the mass only to @xmath143 , which is more in agreement with modeling a data set such as ours where we have an inflated number of reported zero abundances .",
    "the simple dependence structure for @xmath123 allows us to marginalize over @xmath110 and work with @xmath107 and @xmath144 as our joint latent distribution . we have @xmath145 rewriting equation ( [ eq332 ] ) in a simpler form , we get @xmath146 + ( 1-u)\\delta_{c(z_{p})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , equation ( [ eq333 ] ) has a nice interpretation in the sense that , first , it indicates whether the land is transformed or not with probability @xmath147 .",
    "if the land is transformed , it sets observed abundance to be @xmath148 . in the case of available land , if there is a potential presence , it allows for a mem around @xmath107 ; in the case of absence , it stays fixed at @xmath107 . since @xmath134 is related to the observed data and @xmath107",
    "is our surface of interest , the marginalization removes one stage of hierarchy from our model fitting and thus reduces correlation , yielding better behaved mcmc in model fitting .",
    "furthermore , we can retrieve the @xmath92 surface after the fact since @xmath149 .      in the we noted that measurement error and bias typically occur with ecological survey data .",
    "it can manifest itself in the form of detection error , spatial coverage bias [ @xcite ] , and under - reporting of absences .",
    "how do these biases arise in our modeling ?",
    "noteworthy points here are ( i ) the difference between obtaining abundance as actual counts as opposed to through ordinal classifications and ( ii ) what `` no abundance '' means across our collection of grid cells .",
    "nondetection bias ( i.e. , undetected individuals in a sampled location ) tends to be discussed more with regard to animal abundance [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . using counts",
    ", evidently observed abundance is at most true abundance ; error can occur in only one direction . with ordinal counts",
    ", the bias is still expected to reflect under - reporting but , depending upon the categorical definitions , will be much less frequent and need not be absolutely so .",
    "for example , in our data set , plant population size is visually estimated and an observation , especially of large populations , could potentially have error in either direction . in our modeling ,",
    "`` true '' abundance is not `` potential '' abundance . for us",
    ", one could envision true abundance on the latent scale as a `` true '' transformed abundance , say , @xmath150 with measurement error yielding @xmath86 .",
    "then , one might insist that our measurement error model requires @xmath151 . under our measurement error formulation using @xmath92 , we even allow @xmath152 to account for potential overestimation of abundance . evidently , since @xmath153 may occasionally be less than the potential classification @xmath154 at that location , we may be slightly underestimating potential abundance",
    ". we do nt expect this to be consequential and , in any event , with no knowledge about the incidence of _ under - classification _ in our setting , we have no sensible way to correct for this bias .    turning to spatial coverage bias ( i.e.",
    ", individuals not exposed to sampling will be missed ) , for us , with only @xmath1 of grid cells sampled , we certainly are subject to this .",
    "however , the spatial modeling we introduce helps in this regard .",
    "the mean of @xmath87 is @xmath155 regardless of whether we collected any data in @xmath17 .",
    "so , the regression is expected to find the appropriate level for the cell and the spatial smoothing associated with the @xmath156 is expected to provide suitable local adjustment .",
    "we could argue that , if sampling of grid cells is random , this bias can be ignored .",
    "perhaps the most difficult bias to address is the under - sampling of absences .",
    "this bias counters the previous ones ; under - sampling of absences will tend to produce over - estimates of potential abundance . in our setting , under - sampling of absences is reflected in the decision - making that leads to only @xmath1 of cells being sampled , that is , it is not a random @xmath1 that have been sampled .",
    "different from spatial coverage bias , in this context , the ecologist expresses confidence that the species is not present in some of the unsampled cells .",
    "if this is so and we were to set some additional abundances to @xmath51 , this would assert that these `` 0 ' 's are not nondetects and would diminish potential abundance , opposite to the case of nondetects .",
    "of course , in the absence of actual data collection , we would not see any of these @xmath51 s and would adopt model - based inference regarding potential abundance for these cells . in any event , with no explicit knowledge of how sampling sites were chosen , we are unable to attempt correction for this bias .",
    "possibly , approaches to address the effects of preferential sampling [ @xcite ] could be attempted here .",
    "the posterior distributions of interest , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , will be constructed in the post mcmc analysis ( discussed in detail in section  [ subsec43 ] ) . from the conditional structure we first write @xmath157 .",
    "so the likelihood function for a single sample @xmath78 turns out to be @xmath158 .",
    "now @xmath159 can be written as in equation ( [ eq333 ] ) .",
    "again , we have @xmath160 cells with @xmath72 sampling sites within @xmath17 . for each @xmath58",

    "first , with a latent continuous process yielding an ordinal categorical variable , the mean and scale of the distribution can be identified only up to their ratio . in equation ( [ eq331 ] )",
    "the dependence across @xmath170 is specified through conditional means .",
    "hence , all gaussian distributions there are specified with standard deviation @xmath8 .",
    "four categories of abundance allow three free probabilities and the corresponding four latent surfaces will also have @xmath171 degrees of freedom .",
    "as noted above , we set @xmath172 with @xmath173 as free parameters .",
    "we also need to ensure that all three @xmath174 surfaces can be distinguished from each other .",
    "since transformation percentage @xmath147 is given a priori , it is straightforward to separate @xmath107 and @xmath110 .",
    "we turn to the joint distribution for @xmath175 given as @xmath176 . with fixed variances and no constraint on measurement error , there would be no need to bring in @xmath107 ; it is redundant , there is no way to distinguish between @xmath107 and @xmath134 , and one can use the marginal @xmath177 .",
    "now the constraint comes into the picture ; it makes the @xmath134 surface non - gaussian though the @xmath107 surface is .",
    "the greater the measurement error , the more departure from gaussianity in the marginal distribution of @xmath134 .",
    "again , the measurement error can not be estimated on any absolute scale , since the latent @xmath174 scales are fixed for identifiability .",
    "it will be controlled by parameters like @xmath105 and  @xmath104 . to compare the relative effect of measurement error across different species , under fixed scale parameters ,",
    "@xmath178 is a candidate but other model features can be informative as well .",
    "finally , the full model specification , described in equation ( [ eq331 ] ) , can be represented through a graphical model , shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .     within cell @xmath17 .",

    "here , we describe how to design a computationally efficient mcmc algorithm for the model .",
    "we then discuss how to summarize the posterior samples to estimate important model features .",
    "introduction of latent layers , although increasing the parameter dimension in the model , makes the posterior full conditionals standard and easy to sample from .",
    "our goal is to efficiently estimate components of @xmath180 which control potential abundance .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ eq333 ] ) as follows : @xmath1811_{z_{p } \\leq0 } \\nonumber\\\\[-8pt]\\\\[-8pt ] & & { }   +    ( 1-u)\\delta_{c(z_{p})}1_{z_p>0},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and work with equation ( [ eq411 ] ) to implement the computation for the model fitting .",
    "we start with updating all @xmath182 using @xmath183 and then drawing components of @xmath180 from their respective posterior full conditionals based on @xmath184 @xmath185 .",

    "the problematic part is sampling the spatial effects , with approximately 37,000 grid cells . to handle this issue",
    ", we used a parallelization method where @xmath68 is divided into disjoint and exhaustive subregions @xmath199 along with a resultant set of _ boundary _ cells @xmath200 arising through the car proximity matrix .",

    "in other cases ( e.g. , to study abundance pattern of animals ) it may be reasonable to treat transformation as another covariate influencing species habitat .",
    "also , it may be imagined that the relationship between potential abundance and environmental variables is not linear as specified in equation  ( [ eq331 ] ) , for example , environmental variables may affect larger abundance classes differently from smaller abundance classes ; piecewise linear specification , introducing different regression coefficients over the different abundance classes , could be explored .",
    "another possible extension lies in joint modeling of two or more species .",

    "<S> modeling species abundance patterns using local environmental features is an important , current problem in ecology . </S>",
    "<S> the cape floristic region ( cfr ) in south africa is a global hot spot of diversity and endemism , and provides a rich class of species abundance data for such modeling . here , we propose a multi - stage bayesian hierarchical model for explaining species abundance over this region . </S>",
    "<S> our model is specified at areal level , where the cfr is divided into roughly @xmath0 one minute grid cells ; species abundance is observed at some locations within some cells . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance values are ordinally categorized . </S>",
    "<S> environmental and soil - type factors , likely to influence the abundance pattern , are included in the model . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the empirical abundance pattern as a degraded version of the potential pattern , with the degradation effect accomplished in two stages . </S>",
    "<S> first , we adjust for land use transformation and then we adjust for measurement error , hence misclassification error , to yield the observed abundance classifications . an important point in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> is that only @xmath1 of the grid cells have been sampled and that , for sampled grid cells , the number of sampled locations ranges from one to more than one hundred . </S>",
    "<S> still , we are able to develop potential and transformed abundance surfaces over the entire region .    in the hierarchical framework , </S>",
    "<S> categorical abundance classifications are induced by continuous latent surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the degradation model above is built on the latent scale . </S>",
    "<S> on this scale , an areal level spatial regression model was used for modeling the dependence of species abundance on the environmental factors . </S>",
    "<S> to capture anticipated similarity in abundance pattern among neighboring regions , spatial random effects with a conditionally autoregressive prior ( car ) were specified . </S>",
    "<S> model fitting is through familiar markov chain monte carlo methods . </S>",
    "<S> while models with car priors are usually efficiently fitted , even with large data sets , with our modeling and the large number of cells , run times became very long . </S>",
    "<S> so a novel parallelized computing strategy was developed to expedite fitting . </S>",
    "<S> the model was run for six different species . with categorical data , </S>",
    "<S> display of the resultant abundance patterns is a challenge and we offer several different views . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns are of importance on their own , comparatively across the region and across species , with implications for species competition and , more generally , for planning and conservation .    ,    ,    ,    . </S>"
