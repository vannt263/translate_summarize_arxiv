    "since 1998 , a series of independent observations , including type ia supernova @xcite , weak lens @xcite , cosmic microwave background anisotropy @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , baryon oscillation @xcite , etc . , have confirmed that our universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "this result conflicts fiercely with the prediction of general relativity , and therefore triggers a `` golden age '' of cosmology since researchers in cosmology , astrophysics , general relativity , particle physics are all involved in seeking for viable models to explain this phenomena . within the frame of general relativity , the cosmic speed - up can be viewed as an indication that the present universe is dominated by certain mysterious fluid with large negative pressure , called `` dark energy ''",
    ". however , such simple explanations could hardly be satisfactory .",
    "the simplest @xmath3cdm model , which fits the observation data best so far , assumes a cosmological constant to be responsible for the dark content .",
    "but the observed value of the constant @xmath3 is unnaturally smaller than any estimation by tens of orders @xcite .",
    "other dynamical dark energy models then waive evolving scalar fields to replace and resemble the cosmological constant ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "these early attempts provide us with initial understanding of the complexity of the problem , though they chiefly serve for empirical fittings with comparatively poor theoretical motivation , and none of such models turn out to be problem - free .    in view of the challenge and the fact that gravity is the only dominant long - range interaction insofar as we know , it is reasonable to consider the possibility that we have not fully understood the character of gravity on a cosmological scale .",
    "therefore , the exploration of alternative theories of gravity are proposed .",
    "one of such examples is the kaluza - klein ( kk ) theory , which was initiated by the motivation of unifying the gravitation field and the electromagnetic field in a five - dimensional ( 5-d ) metric .",
    "since the fifth dimension is supposed to be a compact @xmath4 circle with an extremely tiny radius , it would actually yield no observable effect .",
    "graceful though , the original version of kk theory fails in passing the solar - system experiment @xcite .",
    "but recently a new model of modified ( non - compact ) kaluza - klein cosmology was investigated in @xcite , where the universe in turns inflates , decelerates , and then accelerates in respectively early times , radiation dominated era and matter dominated era .",
    "this result meets the observational facts roughly .",
    "but there still exist problems such as that it leaves no decelerated period in the matter - dominant era for the formation of large scale structure .",
    "besides , in @xcite brans - dicke ( bd ) theory of gravity was introduced to match the mach s principle .",
    "it is found in @xcite that 5-d bd theory can naturally predict the cosmic acceleration without the requirement of a time - varying bd parameter @xmath5 or a fabricated potential in its 4-d counterpart @xcite .",
    "thus , it lends confidence and motivation to the effort of extending gravitational theories in 4-d to 5-d space - time .",
    "also , note that in @xcite the allowed range for parameters @xmath6 is considerably wide , where @xmath5 is the bd parameter and @xmath7 represents the interaction between the extra dimension and other spatial ones .",
    "we may suspect that further information concerning the different choices of @xmath6 are masked in the formalism of 5-d bd theory .",
    "given the argument for the equivalence ( by evolutional effect ) of the @xmath0 theory of gravity to certain special cases of bd theory up to a potential term @xcite , we are led to consider the 5-d @xmath0 theories of gravity for such information .",
    "it is worth noting that the scale of the compact extra dimension of 5-d gravity theories , which we are considering , is constrained to be less than 50 @xmath8 by current experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 theories of gravity extends the hilbert - einstein action in general relativity to @xmath9 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the curvature scalar @xmath10 .",
    "the reason for such exploration in 4-d spacetime is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "recent research has shown that a small correction to the hilbert - einstein action by adding an inverse term of @xmath10 would lead to acceleration of the universe @xcite , and a large variety of models are proposed since then ( for review paper , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , few of them turn out to be without problem and most of them admit fine - tunings so as to be consistent with experiments . on the other hand , it is highly possible that future quantum theory of gravity , such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , etc . , would bring about modifications to the action for classical general relativity , just like that general relativity has introduced corrections to the newton s gravitation theory .",
    "therefore , this effort would potentially match the low energy effective theory of quantum gravity and therefore accelerate its birth .    with above motivations",
    ", we thought that modified gravity without fine - tuning should better be constructed in higher dimensions .",
    "it is shown in this paper that values of the parameters in the 5-d theory are all with reasonable deductions and interpretations . in 5-d spacetimes with a hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector field ,",
    "the 5-d @xmath0 theories of gravity are reduced to the sensible 4-d world in section [ killing ] .",
    "here we have adopted kk s idea that the fifth dimension is a small unobservable compact ring @xmath4 , so that a killing vector field would arise naturally in the low energy environment .",
    "further , in view of that in kk s theory one can find the sensible 4-d universe to be expanding ( without acceleration ) as a result of the contraction of the extra dimension , we assume that there is certain interaction between the fifth dimension and other ones at present , and take their relationship to be the general power - law form .",
    "then the reduced theories are carefully studied in the @xmath11 case of the frw metric in section [ frw ] .",
    "we consider a special class of models with @xmath1 and present the numerical simulation of the evolution history of the matter dominated universe in section [ numeri ] , demonstrating its consistency with the observation .",
    "finally , we end with discussions in section [ jielun ] on the similarity and difference between the 5-d @xmath0 theories and the 5-d bd theory , as well as further indications from our 5-d models .",
    "we start with the action in 5-d space - time : @xmath12 here @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the gravitational constant in the 5-d spacetime , and @xmath15 represents the matter term in the total action @xmath16 .",
    "variation of ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath17 gives @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "note that we have employed the abstract index @xcite and @xmath21 represent quantities in the 5-d spacetime .",
    "contracting equation ( [ 5dfield ] ) with @xmath17 , we obtain the dynamical equation for the scalar field @xmath22 : @xmath23.\\ ] ] since here @xmath24=5 instead of 4 , the dynamical equation of @xmath22 differs from its usual 4-d counterpart .",
    "next we consider the structure of the 5-d spacetime and its relation to our sensible 4-d world .",
    "first , as mentioned in the introduction , we assume that the 5-d spacetime possesses a killing vector field @xmath25 which represents the fifth dimension and is everywhere space - like .",
    "recall that the killing reduction of 4-d spacetime is studied by geroch @xcite and is further extended to the 5-d spacetime by yang _ et al .",
    "therefore , following these works we introduce the 5-d metric as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the metric in the usual 4-d universe and @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath25 is not hypersurface - orthogonal , it would be related to electromagnetic 4-potential in the reduced 4-d theory , as demonstrated by kk theory .",
    "since we are chiefly concerned with the cosmological effect of the reduced model , our discussion is restricted to the case where @xmath25 is hypersurface - orthogonal for convenience . without losing generality ,",
    "a coordinate system can be chosen as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "then the line element of @xmath31 reads @xmath32 , while ricci tensors and the dynamical equation of @xmath33 in 5-d and 4-d spacetime bear the following relation @xcite : @xmath34 @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the covariant derivative on 4-d spacetime and is defined as @xcite @xmath37 satisfying all the conditions for a derivative operator . on the other hand ,",
    "the stress - energy tensor in ( [ 5dfield ] ) is regarded as a perfect fluid in 5-d spacetime with the expression @xcite @xmath38 =      l^{-1}{\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\left[t_{ab}^{(4 ) } + p { \\lambda}\\xi_a\\xi_b\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the 4-d energy density and the hydrostatic pressure respectively , and l is a constant representing the coordinate scale of the fifth dimension .",
    "this extension of the stress - energy tensor of the 4-d perfect fluid to a 5-d one can be understood in the following way : because the fifth dimension is compact and attached to every point of the 4-d space - time , @xmath39 and @xmath40 experienced by a 4-d observer should be an integrated effect throughout the compact ring .",
    "if we further expect that the fluid distributes homogeneously and does not travel along the fifth dimension , it is clear that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and hence equation ( [ tab ] ) is obtained . combining ( [ 5dfield ] ) , ( [ 5ddynamics ] ) with ( [ riccireduction ] ) , ( [ lambdareduction ] ) , and ( [ tab ] ) , straightforward calculations lead to the 4-d field equation : @xmath43\\\\       & & + \\frac{1}{f'(r ) } ( d_a d_b -h_{ab}d^c d_c)f'(r )       - \\frac{1}{2 f'(r)}\\lambda^{-1 } h_{ab } ( d^c{\\lambda})d_cf'(r ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the dynamical equations of @xmath33 and @xmath22 : @xmath44 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 represents the usual 4-d gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will study the cosmological predictions of the reduced @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the metric of a spatially isotropic and homogeneous 4-d spacetime is the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric with three possible structures of the space . as suggested by the observation @xcite",
    ", we only handle the spatially flat case where the 4-d line element reads @xmath47 then the two components of the field equation ( [ 4dfield ] ) are : @xmath48 and @xmath49 the dynamical equations of @xmath50 and @xmath22 are respectively : @xmath51 and @xmath52 here an over - dot denotes the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath53 of the isotropic observer , and we have assumed that the scalar field @xmath50 depends only on @xmath53 . note that the conservation equation of the 5-d stress - energy tensor , @xmath54 , gives : @xmath55 which can also be obtained directly from equations ( [ gab1 ] )  ( [ phi1 ] ) . for the common baryonic matter content of the present universe ,",
    "the pressure is negligible compared to the energy density .",
    "thus , we set @xmath56 by approximation in the above equation and get @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the current observed energy density of the luminary matter .    by",
    "now , we have been dealing with the general form of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "next we restrict our discussion to a specific class of @xmath0 models , @xmath1 , to further study the evolutional characteristics of the theory .",
    "it has been shown that this choice in 4-d spacetime , with @xmath59 and the common baryonic matter , could fit the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae without need of dark energy @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath60 and obtain @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a dimensional constant . with the above analysis",
    ", we find the three cosmological evolution equations for numerical simulations from the combination of equations ( [ gab1 ] )  ( [ phi1 ] ) : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65",
    "let us now find the natural initial values of @xmath66 for the numerical simulation .",
    "firstly , @xmath67 themselves have no direct physical meaning and therefore can be simply fixed as 1 ( with no dimension )",
    ". then we can directly determine the value of @xmath68 by the present value of hubble parameter @xmath69 .",
    "secondly , we adopt the dynamical compactification idea of kk cosmology that the contraction of the extra dimension would result in the expansion of the remaining dimensions @xcite , and assume @xmath70 where for a particular @xmath0 theory with given @xmath2 and @xmath62 in eq.([rphi ] ) , the free parameter @xmath7 can be constrained by the observation .",
    "therefore we have @xmath71 .",
    "finally , comparing the matter term in equation ( [ 4dfield ] ) to the field equation of general relativity , we expect @xmath72 , at least for the present period ; thus @xmath73 ( with no dimension either ) and further @xmath74 . in summary ,",
    "the initial conditions are : @xmath75 then we estimate the value of @xmath62 in equations ( [ ai ] )  ( [ phii ] ) and determine the allowed range for the pair of parameters @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "a calculation of the 5-d curvature scalar shows @xmath76 inserting ( [ rphi ] ) , ( [ lambdai ] ) into the expression of @xmath10 and noting that the deceleration parameter @xmath77 is an observable with its present value denoted as @xmath78 , we have @xmath79     h_0 ^ 2.\\ ] ] substituting ( [ alpham ] ) into ( [ ai ] ) , we obtain the relationship between parameters @xmath2 and @xmath7 as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81@xcite and therefore @xmath82 .",
    "one necessary and sufficient condition for the present accelerated expansion of the universe is that the deceleration parameter @xmath83 .",
    "specifically , the allowed range for @xmath78 according to the present observation is @xmath84 @xcite . here",
    "we apply this criteria to determine the allowed range for @xmath2 and @xmath7 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ range1 ] .     allowed range for the values of m and n with @xmath85 @xcite . the horizontal axis stands for different value of @xmath7 , while the vertical axis represents @xmath2 . ,",
    "width=491,height=264 ]    from the figure , it is obvious that there do exist suitable parameters @xmath2 and @xmath7 , that is , suitable formalisms of @xmath1 and corresponding relationships between the extra dimension and the other ones , such that the present cosmic acceleration can be explained without the need of dark energy . besides , fig .",
    "1 also reveals that both positive and negative values of @xmath7 is allowed , indicating that the idea of dynamical compactification can be extended to that both the expansion and the contraction of the extra dimension can be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the other dimensions . besides , we know from equation ( [ alpham ] ) that @xmath86^{-(m-1)}.\\ ] ]     and the possible range for @xmath62 . the range is spanned by the uncertainty of the deceleration parameter @xmath78.,width=491,height=264 ]    using eqs .",
    "( [ mvalue ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) , we depict the @xmath87 relation in fig .",
    "[ alphan ] with the range spanned by @xmath78 , from which we find @xmath62 increases rapidly as @xmath88 increases .",
    "further , one could find from fig .",
    "[ range1 ] or equation ( [ mvalue ] ) that the lower bound of @xmath2 is 1 , corresponding to @xmath89 , and therefore @xmath90 , which is exactly the kk case .",
    "one subtlety concerning this case is that fig .",
    "[ range1 ] as well as equation ( [ mvalue ] ) shows that @xmath91 for @xmath92 , and therefore equation([kk ] ) apparently indicates @xmath93 , contradicting with the present observations .",
    "thus one might think that the kk theory is inconsistent with the observation .",
    "however , this conclusion is misleading , because from the inverse - solving procedure in equation ( [ rphi ] ) , we have already confined our discussion to @xmath94 cases . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath2 , as @xmath7 approaches infinity , is @xmath95 from which we find the upper bound for @xmath2 to be @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the possible range for @xmath2 is narrowed down as @xmath97 .    with equations ( [ ai ] )  ( [ phii ] ) , initial values ( [ ini ] ) and ( [ alpham ] ) , the numerical simulation of the evolution of the scale factor @xmath98 , the scalar field @xmath99 and the deceleration parameter @xmath100 can be conducted . as an example , we choose @xmath101 . then from equation ( [ mvalue ] ) we get @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath103 is approximately @xmath104 .",
    "it is useful to define the effective gravitational `` constant '' from eqs .",
    "( [ 4dfield ] )  ( [ 4dfr ] ) as @xmath105 note that @xmath106 is actually an evolving scalar .",
    "then the evolution characters of @xmath107 and @xmath108 are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ m15n54q06aq ]  [ m15n54q06 g ] respectively . from these figures , it is clear that the present deceleration parameter @xmath102 is in consistent with observation and the above analysis .",
    "moreover , we note the following :    1 .   @xmath100 rolls from a positive value to a negative one smoothly in the recent past .",
    "specifically , if the age of the universe is @xmath109gyr @xcite , the universe turns from deceleration to acceleration at @xmath110gyr .",
    "thus , the `` coincidence '' problem in dark energy can be addressed in this case .",
    "after @xmath100 reaches the minimal value , it rolls back again and becomes positive at @xmath111gyr .",
    "thus , the universe will become decelerating in the future rather than be endlessly accelerating .",
    "numerical simulation for a long period of cosmic evolution shows that the value of @xmath100 becomes divergent at @xmath112 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ diverge ] .",
    "since @xmath113 and its evolution is generally slow , the only reason for the divergence of @xmath100 is @xmath114 . in other words ,",
    "the universe would come to a static point in the finite future .",
    "actually in this period , numerical simulation shows that all quantities , such as @xmath115 and @xmath116 , still remain well - behaved .",
    "after this static point , @xmath98 starts to decrease for a certain period before numerical simulation fails .",
    "thus , around the static point of @xmath98 , numerical simulation is still effective .",
    "@xmath115 decreases from a large value in the past and increases slowly at present , while @xmath116 increases to a maximum value for the present period and decreases slowly in the future .",
    "after the static point of @xmath98 , nonetheless , the decrease of @xmath116 becomes faster and therefore it would approach @xmath117 in the finite future when the numerical simulation fails . actually , since @xmath118 appears in the denominators of eqs .",
    "( [ ai ] )  ( [ phii ] ) , the analysis from this set of equations is no longer applicable for the evolution character beyond the @xmath119 point .",
    "instead , one should take advantage of original equation ( [ 5dfield ] ) ( or eqs .",
    "( [ 4dfield ] )  ( [ 4dfr ] ) by multiplying @xmath22 on both sides ) .",
    "we leave the details about the static point and the evolution beyond to future investigations .",
    "the evolution of @xmath106 is generally slow in the future .",
    "the present value of @xmath106 is maximal with an almost zero evolving speed .",
    "thus , it is also in consistent with the observation data that the present gravitational constant has a negligible evolving speed .    on the other hand , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ range1 ] , the expansion of the extra dimension would also bring about the acceleration of other dimensions .",
    "if we take @xmath120 instead of @xmath121 , the numerical simulation will give similar evolution features of @xmath122 and @xmath123 with the present value of deceleration parameter @xmath102 , which are consistent with observations .",
    "in this case , the universe turned from deceleration to acceleration at @xmath124gyr , which was @xmath125gyr earlier than that in the @xmath126 case .",
    "correspondingly , the future transition point of the universe from acceleration to deceleration is also moved ahead to @xmath127gyr , rendering that the total acceleration period of the universe changes only moderately from @xmath128gyr to @xmath129gyr .",
    "thus , the @xmath130 case is very similar to the @xmath131 case , except that the cosmic transition from deceleration to acceleration and the inverse occur both ahead of time .",
    "the reason for such temporal translation can be viewed in the following way . as shown before , when @xmath97 , the future asymptotic evolution of @xmath33 should be increasing .",
    "therefore , if the initial ( present ) evolution rate for @xmath33 is set to be increasing at present rather than be decreasing , there should be a temporal translation with respect to the evolution of @xmath33 and therefore to other quantities that can be affected .",
    "to clarify the argument for the equivalence of the @xmath0 theory of gravity to certain special cases of bd theory up to a potential term @xcite , we now compare the cosmic evolution of 5-d @xmath0 models developed in previous sections to the 5-d bd theory @xcite . from equation ( [ 4dfield ] ) , it is noticeable that the potential term is @xmath132 , and similar terms also exist in equations ( [ 4dlambda ] ) and ( [ 4dfr ] ) .",
    "these terms correspond to the @xmath133 terms in ( [ ai ] )  ( [ phii ] ) , and would be shown to play significant roles in predicting the future evolution of the universe .",
    "there are three independent functions in the 5-d bd theory @xcite , namely @xmath98 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath116 represents the core idea of bd theory on an evolving gravitation `` constant '' due to the interaction between the local gravitational fields with the faraway matter in the universe .",
    "we note that @xmath100 in this case ( see fig",
    ". 2 in @xcite ) evolves to a constant in the future .",
    "this means that the universe would accelerate permanently in the future until its energy density decreases to be extremely low so that certain quantum effects may become significant , such as the situation in @xcite .",
    "it can also be read from figs .",
    "3  5 in @xcite that the asymptotic values of @xmath134 and @xmath135 are both zero , as further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ratebd ] .",
    "in contrast , in our 5-d @xmath0 theories , fig . [ m15n54q06phi ] has demonstrated that , while @xmath118 evolves to a large value presently and remains positive in the future , the @xmath133 terms render the evolution of @xmath99 to be more complicated .",
    "specifically , the corresponding evolution characteristics of @xmath136 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ratefr ] with specific parameters @xmath101 . as",
    "@xmath137 is an observable , it is interesting to show how @xmath133 terms affect its evolution .",
    "since @xmath138 , @xmath83 , from equation ( [ alpham ] ) we have @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , we do not consider any solution with a negative @xmath118 because of its anti - gravity character .",
    "thus , the coefficient of the @xmath133 term would determine the evolutional inclination of @xmath33 and @xmath118 .",
    "specifically , because @xmath140 and @xmath141 correspond to @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively , the qualitative features of the future evolution of @xmath33 and @xmath118 are as follows :    * if @xmath144 , @xmath145 * if @xmath146 , @xmath147 * if @xmath148 , @xmath149    in view of the constraint illustrated by fig .",
    "[ range1 ] , only the last situation is allowed , where the evolution of @xmath33 and @xmath118 counterbalances each other and therefore the evolution of @xmath106 is generally slow .    in summary , we present the killing reduction of 5-d @xmath0 theories of gravity to the 4-d sensible world",
    ". then we study its cosmological implication by assuming the spatial homogeneity and isotropy , namely , the friedman - robertson - walker metric . with the illustration of a specific example it is found that the theory is consistent with the present observations in a variety of aspects , including the recent cross from cosmic deceleration to acceleration , its prescription of present cosmic speed - up , the negligible evolving speed of the effective gravitational constant , and etc .. in contrast to the kk cosmology , it is worth mentioning that in 5-d @xmath0 theories of gravity , both expansion and contraction of the extra dimension could result in the present accelerated expansion of other spatial dimensions . even for a simple and generic class of @xmath1 models , the 5-d @xmath0 theories of gravity do not need unreasonable or ill - initiated fine - tuning of certain parameters .",
    "hence it is reasonable to infer that the present accelerated expansion of spatial dimensions could be certain basic character of the 5-d spacetimes .    finally , it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the large scale limit , quantum gravity effect would come to be vital and bring about higher - order quantum corrections to the friedman equation to prescribe a static point in the finite future , followed by the recollapse of the universe .",
    "note that the static point in the finite future is also a significant character of the 5-d @xmath0 gravity .",
    "thus , it is of interest to explore whether there are some relation between the 5-d theories of @xmath1 models and the quantum gravity theory applied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the future recollapse also differs from the prediction of endless acceleration scenario in the 5-d bd cosmology @xcite .",
    "hence , 5-d @xmath0 gravity is not simply equivalent to 5-d bd theory , since the effect of potential terms are shown to be vital enough to prescribe different cosmological scenarios in the distant future .",

    "<S> the metric @xmath0 theories of gravity are generalized to five - dimensional spacetimes . by assuming a hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector field representing the compact fifth dimension , the five - dimensional theories are reduced to their four - dimensional formalism . </S>",
    "<S> then we study the cosmology of a special class of @xmath1 models in a spatially flat frw spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the parameter @xmath2 can be constrained to a certain range by the current observed deceleration parameter , and its lower bound corresponds to the kaluza - klein theory . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that both expansion and contraction of the extra dimension may prescribe the smooth transition from the deceleration era to the acceleration era in the recent past as well as an accelerated scenario for the present universe . </S>",
    "<S> hence five - dimensional @xmath0 gravity can naturally account for the present accelerated expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the models predict a transition from acceleration to deceleration in the future , followed by a cosmic recollapse within finite time . </S>",
    "<S> this differs from the prediction of the five - dimensional brans - dicke theory but is in consistent with a recent prediction based on loop quantum cosmology .    </S>",
