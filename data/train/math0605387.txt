    "in his ( corrected ) prize essay  @xcite , h. poincar was the first to imagine around 1890 the existence of  doubly asymptotic solutions \" , that are now called _ transverse homoclinic intersections _ : for a diffeomorphism , these are the transverse intersection points between the stable and unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic periodic orbit . he discovered that this simple assumption implies a very intricate behavior : in  @xcite , he showed that any transverse homoclinic intersection is accumulated by other homoclinic points . in 1935 g.d .",
    "birkhoff proved  @xcite by topological arguments that it is also the limit of infinitely many periodic points .",
    "later on ( in 1965 ) , s. smale introduced @xcite a geometrical model for the dynamics occurring near a homoclinic orbit : the horseshoe is an invariant compact set that carries a hyperbolic dynamics and contains all the complicated phenomena discovered by poincar and birkhoff , but that can also be described by coding .",
    "hence , the transverse homoclinic intersections give birth to very rich dynamics ( in particular , the topological entropy is non zero ) and moreover they are robust ( i.e. they persist under @xmath0-perturbation of the system ) .",
    "s. newhouse then associated @xcite to any hyperbolic periodic orbit having transverse homoclinic intersections a very natural invariant compact set that contains these horseshoes : he defined the _ homoclinic class _ as the closure of all the transverse homoclinic points of this periodic orbit . nowadays the phenomena creating homoclinic bifurcations still remain a major topic in differentiable dynamical systems ( see  @xcite ) .    in the opposite direction ,",
    "smale defined  @xcite a class of diffeomorphisms with very simple dynamics , the _ morse - smale diffeomorphisms _ : the chain recurrent set ( which carries the non - trivial dynamics , see section  [ s.notation ] for the definitions ) is hyperbolic and finite the classical formulation of this definition involves the non - wandering set ( see section  [ s.notation ] ) . ] ; moreover the invariant manifolds of the periodic orbits are in general position ( satisfying the strong transversality condition ) . as a consequence ,",
    "any non - periodic orbit accumulates in the past and in the future on two different periodic orbits ; these diffeomorphisms have no homoclinic intersection .",
    "moreover , the set of these diffeomorphisms is open : in fact , j. palis and smale  @xcite have proven that any @xmath0-perturbation of a morse - smale diffeomorphism is a morse - smale diffeomorphism that is conjugate to the initial dynamics through a homeomorphism ( the dynamics is structurally stable ) .",
    "palis has stated  @xcite many conjectures about dissipative differentiable dynamics and in particular that the homoclinic intersections are  always \" responsible for complicated dynamics : this was formulated for the set @xmath1 of @xmath2-diffeomorphisms ( @xmath3 ) of a compact manifold @xmath4 endowed with the @xmath2-topology .",
    "the space @xmath1 of @xmath2-diffeomorphisms ( @xmath3 ) contains a dense open set which decomposes as the union @xmath5 of two disjoint open sets :    * @xmath6 is the set of morse - smale diffeomorphisms , * @xmath7 is the set of diffeomorphisms having a transverse homoclinic intersection .",
    "one interest of the conjecture is that it gives information on a large ( open and dense ) set of diffeomorphisms .",
    "one may first restrict this question to the open set of _ hyperbolic diffeomorphisms _ which are the diffeomorphisms with hyperbolic chain - recurrent set .",
    "smale has shown  @xcite that the chain - recurrent set of any hyperbolic diffeomorphism is the disjoint union of finitely many basic sets : these are the homoclinic classes defined by newhouse in  @xcite .",
    "if there is no homoclinic intersection , each basic piece is trivial ( it is a periodic orbit ) and the dynamics is morse - smale ( up to a @xmath2-perturbation which gives the transversality between the invariant manifolds of the periodic orbits ) .",
    "hence , the conjecture is satisfied inside the set of hyperbolic diffeomorphisms . ] .",
    "however it was discovered that the set of hyperbolic diffeomorphisms is not dense among differentiable dynamics ( two families of counter - examples were described , starting from those built by r. abraham and smale  @xcite and newhouse  @xcite ) .",
    "palis then conjectured  @xcite that the homoclinic bifurcations are  always \" responsible for non - hyperbolicity :    any @xmath2-diffeomorphism ( @xmath3 ) of a compact manifold can be approximated by a diffeomorphism which is either hyperbolic , has a homoclinic tangency or has a heterodimensional cycle .",
    "it is easy to see that this second conjecture implies the first one since the dynamics at a homoclinic bifurcation can be perturbed in order to create a transverse homoclinic intersection ( see section  [ ss.simple ] ) .",
    "note also that these conjectures hold when @xmath4 is one - dimensional since in this case m. peixoto showed  @xcite that the morse - smale diffeomorphisms are dense in @xmath1 for any @xmath3 .      in the @xmath2 topologies , with @xmath8 ,",
    "very few techniques are available up to here for proving these conjectures ( in particular , a @xmath2-closing lemma is missing ) . on the other hand ,",
    "many tools have been developed during the last decade for the topology @xmath0 allowing substantial progress in this direction .",
    "the @xmath0 strong conjecture has been solved on surfaces by e. pujals and m. sambarino  @xcite ; in higher dimensions some progress have been obtained by several people : s. hayashi , pujals  @xcite and l. wen  @xcite . very recently , c. bonatti , s. gan and wen have managed to show @xcite the weak conjecture on three - dimensional manifolds . in this paper",
    "we are aimed to prove it in any dimension .",
    "any diffeomorphism of a compact manifold can be @xmath0-approximated by a morse - smale diffeomorphism or one exhibiting a transverse homoclinic intersection .    as it was noticed in  @xcite",
    ", this result gives a description of the set of diffeomorphisms having zero topological entropy : we will say that a diffeomorphism @xmath9 has _ robustly zero entropy _ if any diffeomorphism in a @xmath0-neighborhood of @xmath9 has zero entropy .",
    "we define in a similar way the diffeomorphisms having robustly non - zero entropy .",
    "note that if a diffeomorphism is morse - smale it has zero entropy , if it has a transverse homoclinic intersection it has non - zero entropy . as a consequence , we get :    the closure of the set of diffeomorphisms having robustly zero entropy coincides with the closure of the morse - smale diffeomorphisms .",
    "the closure of the set of diffeomorphisms having robustly positive entropy coincides with the closure of the set of diffeomorphisms exhibiting a transverse homoclinic intersection .",
    "this can be compared to a property proved by a. katok @xcite for @xmath10-diffeomorphisms on surfaces : _ the @xmath10 surface diffeomorphisms having positive entropy are the diffeomorphisms exhibiting a transverse homoclinic intersection .",
    "_      the @xmath0-strong conjecture is known to be true ( with a better conclusion ) among diffeomorphisms whose dynamics splits into finitely many pieces only : these are diffeomorphisms which do nt admits _ _ filtrations _ _ admits _ filtrations with an arbitrarily large number of levels _ if there exists arbitrarily long sequences of open sets @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 and such that the maximal set inside @xmath13 is non - empty for each @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently @xmath9 has infinitely many chain - recurrence classes , see section  [ s.techniques ] . a diffeomorphism which can not be @xmath0 approximated by a diffeomorphism admiting filtrations with an arbitrarily large number of levels",
    "is sometimes called _",
    "tame_. ] with an arbitrarily large number of levels .",
    "any diffeomorphism of a compact manifold can be @xmath0-approximated by a diffeomorphism which is hyperbolic or has a heterodimensional cycle or admits filtrations with an arbitrarily large number of levels .    the result was proved on surfaces by ma  @xcite . with the results of  @xcite ,",
    "this theorem is just an improvement from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem c ) and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem d ) .",
    "the main argument is based on liao s and ma s techniques  @xcite .",
    "this is done in the appendix .",
    "let us also mention some related results in the conservative setting .",
    "if @xmath4 is endowed with a symplectic form @xmath15 or a volume form @xmath16 , one considers the spaces @xmath17 and @xmath18 of @xmath2 diffeomorphisms that preserve @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "since there is no conservative morse - smale dynamics , one expects that the set of conservative diffeomorphisms having a transverse homoclinic intersection is dense .",
    "* for the @xmath2 topology , @xmath3 , some results are known on surfaces : e. zehnder has proven  @xcite that any surface diffeomorphism having an elliptic periodic point is approximated by diffeomorphisms having a transverse homoclinic orbit .",
    "more generally , the existence of transverse homoclinic intersection is dense in most homotopy class of conservative surface @xmath2-diffeomorphisms : see the works by c. robinson  @xcite , d. pixton  @xcite and f. oliveira  @xcite .",
    "* for the @xmath0-topology , one has a better description : by the conservative closing lemma of c. pugh and robinson  @xcite , for any diffeomorphism @xmath9 in a dense g@xmath19 subset of @xmath20 or @xmath21 , the hyperbolic periodic points are dense in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , f. takens has proven  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) that each hyperbolic periodic point has a transverse homoclinic orbit .",
    "this gives the @xmath0 weak palis conjecture in the conservative setting . * with m .- c .",
    "arnaud and bonatti , we have shown  @xcite that if @xmath4 is connected it is @xmath0-generically a single homoclinic class , implying that the dynamics of @xmath9 is transitive ( there exists an orbit that is dense in @xmath4 ) .",
    "one can thus argue as for diffeomorphisms which do nt admits filtrations with an arbitrarily large number of levels .",
    "the following is proved in the appendix .",
    "any conservative diffeomorphism of a compact surface can be @xmath0-approximated by a conservative diffeomorphism which is anosov or has a homoclinic tangency .",
    "any conservative diffeomorphism of a manifold @xmath4 of dimension @xmath22 can be @xmath0-approximated by a conservative diffeomorphism which is anosov or has a heterodimensional cycle .",
    "one possible approach for analyzing a dissipative dynamical system is to _ split the dynamics into elementary pieces _ that one could study independently .",
    "this method is now well understood for the @xmath0-generic diffeomorphisms : by using pseudo - orbits , c. conley s theory  @xcite decomposes the dynamics on the chain - recurrent set of any homeomorphism into elementary pieces , called _ chain - recurrence classes_. in particular , if each chain - recurrence class of a generic diffeomorphism is reduced to a periodic orbit , then the dynamics is morse - smale .",
    "following ideas developed by pugh for the closing lemma  @xcite and by hayashi for the connecting lemma  @xcite , we proved with bonatti a connecting lemma for pseudo - orbits  @xcite : for the @xmath0-generic diffeomorphisms it implies that a chain - recurrence class which contains a periodic point @xmath23 coincides with the homoclinic class of @xmath23 . in order to prove the weak conjecture , it thus remains to study the case there also exist chain - recurrence classes which do not contain any periodic orbit ( these are called _ aperiodic classes _ ) .    we have shown  @xcite that , for @xmath0 generic diffeomorphisms , the aperiodic classes are the limit for the hausdorff distance of a sequence of hyperbolic periodic orbits . if one shows that the invariant manifolds have uniform size , one can expect that they intersect , implying the existence of a homoclinic intersection . for non - hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , we will try to _ get weaker forms of hyperbolicity _ : we look for the existence of _ dominated splittings _ or of _ partially hyperbolic structures_. one can hope to obtain such properties if one works with diffeomorphisms that are far from the known obstructions to the uniform hyperbolicity .",
    "once we are reduced to analyzing partially hyperbolic systems , the size of the invariant manifold is controlled in the directions where the dynamics is uniformly contracting or expanding .",
    "it remains to understand what happens in the other directions : this is much simpler if _ the weak directions are one - dimensional _ , since the order of @xmath24 can be used in this case .",
    "let us explain how these ideas already appear in the previous works . on surfaces , pujals and sambarino  @xcite obtain a dominated splitting @xmath25 for diffeomorphisms that are @xmath0-far from homoclinic tangencies .",
    "then , they apply @xmath10 denjoy techniques to control the distortion , the size of the invariant manifold and the expansion or contraction in both directions .",
    "they strongly use the fact that each weak bundle @xmath26 or @xmath27 is one - dimensional but also that they are extremal : it is possible to generalize their method in higher dimension in order to analyze partially hyperbolic dynamics with a one - dimensional central direction but under the assumption that the strong stable or the strong unstable direction is trivial ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    in higher dimensions , bonatti , gan and wen have managed  @xcite to control a non - extremal central bundle but their argument is semi - global and the partially hyperbolic sets they consider have to be chain - recurrent classes : they focus on the periodic orbits and the existence of filtrating neighborhoods implies long central stable or unstable manifolds . in dimension three , they can prove that any @xmath0-generic diffeomorphism far from homoclinic bifurcations has such a partially hyperbolic chain - recurrence class .",
    "in dimension larger or equal to @xmath28 , their argument is not sufficient since one would have to consider chain - recurrence classes with mixed behaviors , i.e. containing partially hyperbolic proper subsets whose stable directions have different dimension .",
    "this prevents the existence of a partially hyperbolic structure on the whole chain - recurrence class .    in this paper",
    "we give a different method which allows to deal with any partially hyperbolic chain - transitive set and to perform local arguments . as in the previous works , the proof of the main theorem",
    "is obtained in two steps :    there exists a dense g@xmath19 subset @xmath29 such that for any diffeomorphism @xmath30 , there is an invariant compact set @xmath31 which carries a minimal dynamics but is not a periodic orbit and which is partially hyperbolic with a one - dimensional central bundle .",
    "there exists a dense g@xmath19 subset @xmath32 such that any diffeomorphism @xmath9 in @xmath33 and any chain - transitive set @xmath34 of @xmath9 which is partially hyperbolic with a one - dimensional central bundle satisfy the following property : if @xmath34 is not a periodic orbit , then it is the limit for the hausdorff distance of non - trivial relative homoclinic classes .",
    "these two theorems are proven in the last section of the paper .",
    "theorem a is a consequence of wen s study  @xcite of diffeomorphisms @xmath0-far from homoclinic bifurcations and of the minimally non - hyperbolic sets .",
    "theorem b is obtained by introducing _ central models _ :",
    "they are defined and studied in an abstract way in section  [ s.abstract ] ; then in section  [ s.application ] we show how they appear in differentiable dynamics .",
    "in particular we explain how they imply the existence of homoclinic intersections : some of the arguments here were already used in  @xcite .",
    "a difficulty when one wants to study a partially hyperbolic system is that we do nt know in general if an invariant central foliation exist .",
    "m. hirsch , pugh and m. shub  @xcite however have shown that a weaker property always holds : there is a locally invariant family of central plaques .",
    "this object has been already used many times ( see for instance  @xcite or the  fake foliations \" in the work by k. burns and a. wilkinson  @xcite ) .",
    "the central model is a tool for understanding the dynamics along the plaques ; in particular , we forget that different central plaques may have wild intersections .",
    "the second ingredient is to replace the @xmath10 distortion techniques in  @xcite by topological arguments . in particular , one proves topological contraction in the central direction by looking for attractors in the central models : they are obtained by using pseudo - orbits and arguments of conley s theory .",
