    "the concept of quantum computing , introduced at the beginning of 1980s by richard feynman , is animated by the fact that quantum systems make possible new interesting forms of computational and communication processes .",
    "in fact , quantum computation can be seen as an extension of classical computation where new primitive information resources are introduced . especially , the concept of quantum bit ( qubit for short ) which is the quantum counterpart of the classical bit .",
    "thus , new forms of computational processes are developed in order to operate with these new information resources . in classical computation",
    ", information is encoded by a series of bits represented by the binary values @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "bits are manipulated via ensemble of logical gates such as _ not , or , and _ etc , that form a circuit giving out the result of a calculation .    standard quantum computing is based on quantum systems described by finite dimensional hilbert spaces , such as @xmath3 , that is the two - dimensional hilbert space where a generic _ qubit _ lives . hence , a qubit is represented by a unit vector in @xmath3 and , generalizing to a positive integer @xmath4 , _",
    "@xmath4-qubits _ are represented by unit vectors in @xmath5 ( @xmath4- times ) .",
    "similarly to the classical case , we can introduce and study the behavior of a number of _ quantum logical gates _",
    "( hereafter quantum gates for short ) operating on qubits . as in the classical case ,",
    "a quantum circuit is identified with an appropriate composition of quantum gates .",
    "they are mathematically represented by unitary operators acting on pure states . in this framework",
    "only reversible processes are considered .",
    "but for many reasons this restriction is unduly . on the one hand",
    ", it does not encompass realistic physical states described by mixtures .",
    "in fact , a quantum system rarely is in a pure state .",
    "this may be caused , for example , by the incomplete efficiency in the preparation procedure and also by manipulations on the system as measurements over pure states , both of which produce statistical mixtures .",
    "it motivated the study of a more general model of quantum computational processes , where pure states and unitary operators are replaced by density operators and quantum operations , respectively .",
    "this more general approach , where not only reversible transformations are considered , is called _ quantum computation with mixed states _ @xcite . in this powerful model",
    ", fuzzy logic can play an important role to describe certain aspects of the combinational structures of quantum circuits .",
    "our work is motivated on a fuzzy behavior of the @xmath0 quantum gate that arises when the model of quantum computation with mixed states is considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 1 contains generalities about tensor product structures to describe bipartite quantum systems . in section 2",
    "we recall some basic notions about the model of quantum computation with mixed states . in section 3 we study fuzzy aspects of the @xmath0 when factorized inputs are considered .",
    "section 4 generalizes the precedent section by considering non - factorized states .",
    "finally in section 5 we establish necessary and sufficient condition on the input of @xmath0 for which the factorizability of density operators in @xmath6 is preserved by @xmath0 .",
    "the notion of _ state of a physical system _ is familiar from its use in classical mechanics , where it is linked to the initial conditions ( the initial values of position and momenta ) which determine the solutions of the equations of motion for the system . for any value of time",
    ", the state is represented by a point in the phase space . in classical physics",
    ", compound systems can be decomposed into their subsystems .",
    "conversely , individual systems can be combined to give overall composite systems . in this way , a classical global system is completely described in terms of the states of its subsystems and their mutual dynamic interactions .",
    "this property about classical systems is known as _",
    "separability principle_. from a mathematical point of view , the separability condition of classical systems comes from the fact that states of compound systems are represented as direct sum of the states of their subsystems .    in quantum mechanics",
    "the description of the state becomes substantially modified .",
    "a quantum state can be either pure or mixed .",
    "a _ pure state _ is described by a unit vector in a hilbert space and it is denoted by @xmath7 in dirac notation . when a quantum system is not in a pure state , it is represented by a probability distibution of pure states , the so called _",
    "mixed state_. mixed states are mathematically modelled by _ density operators _ on a hilbert space , i.e. positive self - adjoint , trace class operators . in terms of density operators ,",
    "a pure state @xmath8 can be represented as the projector @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in quantum theory , the most general description of a quantum states is encoded by density operators .    in quantum mechanics",
    "a system consisting of many parts is represented by the tensor product of the hilbert spaces associated with the individual parts .",
    "we restrict our investigation to compound systems living in the bipartite hilbert space of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are finite dimensional .",
    "but not all density operators on @xmath10 are expressible as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a density operator living in @xmath15 , for @xmath16 .",
    "thus , there exist properties of quantum systems that characterize the whole system but that are not reducible to the local properties of its parts .",
    "unlike classical physics , compound quantum systems can violate the separability principle .",
    "from a mathematical point of view , the origin of this difference between classical and quantum systems arises from the tensor product structure related to the hilbert spaces .",
    "more precisely , the non - factorizability property of quantum states is related to the fact that the direct sum of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a proper subset of @xmath10 .    in what follows",
    "we provide a formal description of this instance of non - factorizability of quantum states in compound systems of the form @xmath10 .    due to the fact that the pauli matrices @xmath17 ,    \\quad    \\sigma_2 =    \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & -i \\\\      i & 0    \\end{array}\\right ] ,    \\quad    \\sigma_3 =    \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      1 & 0 \\\\      0 & -1    \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath18 are a basis for the set of operators over @xmath3 , an arbitrary density operator @xmath19 over @xmath3 may be represented as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are three real numbers such @xmath23 .",
    "the triple @xmath24 represents the point of the bloch sphere that is uniquely associated to @xmath19 .",
    "a similar canonical representation can be obtained for any @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space by using the notion of generalized pauli - matrices .",
    "let @xmath25 be a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space and @xmath26 be the canonical othonormal basis of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be two natural numbers such that : @xmath29 .",
    "then , the _",
    "generalized pauli - matrices _ are defined as follows : @xmath30}= { \\vert { \\psi_j } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_k } \\vert}+ { \\vert { \\psi_k } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_j } \\vert}\\ ] ] @xmath31}= i({\\vert { \\psi_j } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_k } \\vert}-{\\vert { \\psi_k } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_j } \\vert})\\ ] ] and for @xmath32 @xmath33}= \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{k(k+1)}}({\\vert { \\psi_1 } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_1 } \\vert}+\\cdots+{\\vert { \\psi_k } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_k } \\vert}-k{\\vert { \\psi_{k+1 } } \\rangle}{\\langle { \\psi_{k+1 } } \\vert}).\\ ] ]    if @xmath34 one immediately obtains : @xmath35}= \\sigma_1 $ ] , @xmath36}= \\sigma_2 $ ] and @xmath37}= \\sigma_3.$ ]    let @xmath19 be a density operator of the @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath38 .",
    "for any @xmath28 , where @xmath39 , let @xmath40 the sequence @xmath41 is called the _ generalized bloch vector _ associated to @xmath19 , in view of the following well known result :    [ blochvect]@xcite let @xmath19 be a density operator of the @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath38 and let @xmath42 . then @xmath19 can be canonically represented as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 identity matrix .",
    "@xmath46    a kind of converse of theorem [ blochvect ] reads : a matrix @xmath19 having the form @xmath47 is a density operator if an only if its eigenvalues are non - negative .",

    "@xmath65-factorizable _ iff @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a density operator in @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a density operator in @xmath70 .",
    "it is well known that , if @xmath19 is @xmath65-factorizable as @xmath66 , this factorization is unique and @xmath67 and @xmath69 correspond to the reduced states of @xmath19 on @xmath68 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "+ suppose that @xmath71 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "let us consider the generalized pauli matrices @xmath72 and @xmath73 arising from @xmath54 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "if we define the following coefficients : @xmath74 ) - tr(\\rho [ \\sigma_j^a \\otimes i^{(k)}])tr(\\rho [ i^{(m)}\\otimes\\sigma_l^b])\\ ] ] and if we consider the matrix @xmath75 defined as @xmath76 then @xmath75 represents the  additional component \" of @xmath19 when @xmath19 is not a factorized state .",
    "more precisely , we can establish the following proposition :    [ decomposition]@xcite let @xmath19 be a density operator in @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath77 @xmath46    the above proposition gives a formal representation of the instance of holism mentioned at the beginning of the section .",
    "in fact , a state @xmath19 in @xmath78 does not only depend on its reduced states @xmath50 and @xmath53 , but also the summand @xmath75 is involved .",
    "let us notice that @xmath75 is not a density operator and then it does not represent a physical state .",
    "as already mentioned , a qubit is a pure state in the hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "the standard orthonormal basis @xmath79 of @xmath3 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , is generally called _ logical basis_. this name refers to the fact that the logical truth is related to @xmath82 and the falsity to @xmath83 .",
    "thus , pure states @xmath8 in @xmath3 are superpositions of the basis vectors @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are complex numbers such that @xmath87 . recalling the born rule ,",
    "any qubit @xmath88 may be regarded as a piece of information , where the numbers @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to the probability - values associated to the information described by the basic states @xmath83 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "hence , we confine our interesting to the probability value @xmath91 , that is related to the basis vector associated with the logical truth .",
    "arbitrary quantum computational states live in @xmath92 .",
    "a special basis , called the @xmath93-_computational basis _ , is chosen for @xmath94 .",
    "more precisely , it consists of the @xmath93 orthogonal states @xmath95 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is in binary representation and @xmath95 can be seen as tensor product of states ( kronecker product ) @xmath98 , with @xmath99 .",
    "then , a pure state @xmath100 is a superposition of the basis vectors @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "as already mentioned , in the usual representation of quantum computational processes , a quantum circuit is identified with an appropriate composition of _ quantum gates _",
    ", mathematically represented by _ unitary operators _ acting on pure states of a convenient ( @xmath4-fold tensor product ) hilbert space @xmath94 @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we give a short description of the model of quantum computers with mixed states .",
    "we associate to each vector of the logical basis of @xmath3 two density operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 that represent , in this framework , the falsity - property and the truth - property , respectively .",
    "let us consider the operator @xmath105 on @xmath106 . by applying the born rule",
    ", we consider the probability of a density operator @xmath19 as follows : @xmath107 note that , in the particular case in which @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , we obtain that @xmath110 .",
    "thus , this probability value associated to @xmath19 is the generalization of the probability value considered for qubits . in the model of quantum computation with mixed states , the role of quantum gates",
    "is replaced by quantum operations .",
    "a _ quantum operation _",
    "@xcite is a linear operator @xmath111 - where @xmath112 is the space of linear operators in the complex hilbert space @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) - representable ( following the first kraus representation theorem ) as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 are operators satisfying @xmath117 .",
    "it can be seen that a quantum operation maps density operators into density operators .",
    "each unitary operator @xmath118 has a natural correspondent quantum operation @xmath119 such that , for each density operator @xmath19 , @xmath120 . in this way ,",
    "quantum operations are generalizations of unitary operators .",
    "it provides a powerfull mathematical model where also irreversible porcesses can be considered .",
    "as in classical case , also in quantum computation it is useful to implement some kind of if - then - elseoperations .",
    "more precisely , it means that we have to consider the evolution of a set of qubits depending upon the values of some other set of qubits .",
    "the gates that implement these kind of operations are called controlled gates .",
    "the controlled gates we are interested on , is the _ controlled - not gate _",
    "( @xmath0 , for short ) .",
    "an usual application of the @xmath0 gate is to generate entangle states , starting from factorizable ones .",
    "this is a crucial step for quantum teleportation protocol and quantum cryptography .",
    "the @xmath0 gate , takes two qbits as input , a control qbit and a target qbit , and performs the following operation :    * if the control qbit is @xmath83 , then @xmath0 behaves as the identity * if the control bit is @xmath82 , then the target bit is flipped .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is given by the unitary transformation @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the sum modulo @xmath124 .",
    "note that , confining in the computational basis only , the behaviour of @xmath0 replaces the classical xor connective .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath0 is given by : @xmath125    since @xmath0 is a unitary matrix , it naturally admits an extension as quantum operation . noting that @xmath126 , its extension as quantum operation is given by :    @xmath127    [ notfact ] let @xmath19 , @xmath128 be two density operators in @xmath129 .",
    "then : @xmath130    let @xmath131 be density operators in @xmath132 .",
