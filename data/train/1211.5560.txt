    "flavour groups @xmath0 and their peculiar breaking to residual symmetries @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the charged lepton and in the neutrino sector , respectively , have been applied in the past in order to predict lepton mixing angles and the dirac phase in a model - independent way , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent examples is tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing @xcite which can be derived with the help of the flavour groups @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the reactor mixing angle @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xcite , however , clearly show that many patterns which have been discussed in the literature are strongly disfavoured , because they predict vanishing or very small @xmath20 .",
    "for this reason , proposals have been made in which either the groups @xmath0 are chosen to be large , e.g. @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , or the symmetry is reduced , e.g. @xmath24 is considered instead of @xmath25 in the neutrino sector @xcite .",
    "we explore a different approach in this paper and consider a scenario with three majorana neutrinos in which a discrete , finite flavour group @xmath0 and a @xmath1 symmetry are combined and are broken in such a way that the residual symmetry in the neutrino sector is @xmath6 with @xmath26 being a subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the residual symmetry @xmath5 in the charged lepton sector is - as in preceding approaches @xcite - chosen as cyclic symmetry ( or product thereof ) which allows to distinguish between the three generations of charged leptons .",
    "we show for a general @xmath0 that such a breaking pattern allows to predict lepton mixing angles and dirac as well as majorana phases in terms of a single real parameter @xmath2 .",
    "a non - vanishing reactor mixing angle can be easily accommodated and at the same time relations between mixing angles and cp phases are obtained .",
    "in contrast to the scenario without a @xmath1 symmetry , we also predict majorana phases with our present approach .",
    "we discuss in detail the conditions which have to be fulfilled in order to consistently formulate a setup with a flavour symmetry @xmath0 and a @xmath1 symmetry and in order to define the group @xmath17 as a direct product of @xmath26 and @xmath1 .",
    "we also show that in general several independent @xmath1 transformations might be compatible with a flavour group @xmath0 which lead , in general , to physically different results .",
    "we exemplify our formalism with a comprehensive study of @xmath7 and show several interesting mixing patterns whose predictions for the mixing angles are close to the best fit results @xcite for certain values of the parameter @xmath2 .    the idea to combine a flavour symmetry @xmath0 with a @xmath1 symmetry is not new and has been already discussed in some cases in the literature @xcite .",
    "an interesting example is the so - called @xmath27 reflection symmetry which is a combination of the canonical @xmath1 transformation and the @xmath27 exchange symmetry .",
    "this generalized @xmath1 transformation permutes a muon neutrino ( antineutrino ) and a tau antineutrino ( neutrino ) .",
    "if imposed on the neutrino mass matrix in the basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , it forces the elements of the second and third rows of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix to have the same absolute values . as a consequence",
    ", one finds @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , maximal atmospheric mixing is predicted and , in view of the latest global fits @xcite , also the dirac phase @xmath30 has to be maximal .",
    "recently , also the combination of the flavour group @xmath19 with a certain @xmath1 transformation has been discussed in two models @xcite .",
    "other contexts in which flavour symmetries and cp violation appear together are : the idea of so - called geometrical cp violation in which the potential of certain scalars is constrained by a flavour group in such a way that their vacuum expectation values spontaneously break @xmath1 symmetry with phases independent of the parameters of the lagrangian @xcite ; the accidental presence of @xmath1 symmetries has been noticed in potentials invariant under ( single- and double - valued ) dihedral groups @xcite , while attempts to relate the prediction of cp violation to particular properties of certain representations of the group @xmath31 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we first recall several well - known facts about @xmath1 transformations and discuss their combination with a flavour group @xmath0 and which conditions have to be fulfilled in order to consistently define such a setup . assuming three generations of majorana neutrinos , we then present the results for mixing angles and cp phases which are obtained for a general @xmath0 combined with a @xmath1 transformation and broken to @xmath16 and to @xmath6 .",
    "we furthermore study the possibility of and conditions for the presence of an accidental @xmath1 symmetry . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present the case @xmath7 and the different possible @xmath1 transformations compatible with all requirements .",
    "we show that there are only a few independent - and phenomenologically interesting - cases for which we discuss the results for cp phases and mixing angles in detail . apart from that we analyze particular values of the parameter @xmath2 for which the symmetry in the neutrino sector is enhanced , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being a subgroup of a finite flavour group containing @xmath19 .",
    "we comment on results which can also be obtained for @xmath34 .",
    "we conclude in section [ concl ] . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we fix our notations and conventions for the mixing parameters and show that the invariance of the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices under a common generalized @xmath1 transformation @xmath35 leads to trivial dirac and majorana phases . in appendix [ appb ]",
    "we show that the mathematical structure of the group arising from the combination of a flavour symmetry @xmath0 and a @xmath1 symmetry is in general a semi - direct product of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the group associated with @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we recall some basic properties of @xmath1 transformations and of @xmath1 invariance in the lepton sector .",
    "we then discuss how to combine @xmath1 and internal symmetries and we explain how to use @xmath1 and flavour symmetries to constrain lepton mixing parameters . finally , we comment on the possibility of accidental @xmath1 symmetries .",
    "we can define a @xmath1 transformation on a set of fields , collectively denoted by @xmath38 , as (x)= x ^*(x_cp )   [ x ] in matrix notation and with @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the transformation @xmath35 to be a constant unitary symmetric matrix , [ xcond1 ] x x^= x x^ * =  . in this way , @xmath40 , since eq.([x ] ) implies that @xmath41 . in theories with internal symmetries , such as a flavour symmetry @xmath0 ,",
    "it is possible to generalize this requirement on @xmath35 to @xmath42 being a transformation belonging to the group of internal symmetries .",
    "we refer to the transformation in eq .",

    "for spinors we use a two - component notation and omit the obvious action of @xmath1 on the spinor indices ( which contains suitable phases such that @xmath43 ) . in the following",
    "we also omit the dependence of the fields on the space - time point @xmath44 .",
    "let us consider a generalized @xmath1 transformation acting on the three generations of lepton doublets @xmath45 l=x l^ *   which fulfills eq.([xcond1 ] ) . in the interaction basis gauge interactions are @xmath1 conserving , while the requirement of @xmath1 invariance of the yukawa interactions , including terms giving rise to neutrino masses , constrains both the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath46 . ] and the neutrino mass matrix @xmath47 : on the spinor indices .",
    "+ if @xmath35 is not symmetric , the conditions in eq.([invcond ] ) have to be changed into : @xmath48 and @xmath49 . ]",

    "is discussed in the literature , see e.g. @xcite , the existence of a @xmath1 transformation fulfilling eq.([invcond ] ) implies that the cp invariants @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see appendix [ appa ] for notation and conventions of the mixing parameters ) vanish and thus the dirac phase @xmath30 as well as the majorana phases @xmath52 and @xmath53 are trivial , i.e. [ phasestriv ] = 0  ,  = 0  ,  = 0   .",
    "if neutrinos are dirac particles , the second equality in eq.([invcond ] ) has to be changed into [ diracnu ] x^ * m_^m_x = ( m_^m_)^ * .",
    "again , as we show in appendix [ appa ] , the dirac phase is trivial .",
    "this result can also be applied to the quark sector , i.e. the up quark and down quark mass matrices instead of dirac neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices .",
    "we now consider a theory that is invariant under both a flavour symmetry @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "an extensive discussion of how to consistently define a @xmath1 symmetry in gauge theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "we assume that scalar and spinor fields transform according to some representation of the flavour group @xmath0 and we denote a set of fields transforming in a generic irreducible representation @xmath54 of @xmath0 by @xmath38 : =a   , [ rho ] with @xmath55 being a unitary matrix depending on the representation @xmath54 and on the chosen group element @xmath56 of @xmath0 . under @xmath1",

    "one reason for imposing a flavour symmetry @xmath0 is to constrain the form of the lepton mixing matrix in order to explain the observed pattern of mixing angles",

    "thus , @xmath16 is in general a ( direct ) product of cyclic symmetries , @xmath83 .",
    "this choice of subgroups of @xmath0 and their relative embedding into the latter predict the form of the lepton mixing matrix , up to permutations of rows and columns and up to arbitrary majorana phases @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can be implemented in concrete models in which the desired symmetry breaking pattern of the group @xmath0 can be achieved via spontaneous or explicit breaking and corrections to such a pattern are calculable ( and are usually small ) , see @xcite for reviews .    in the present paper",
    "we instead consider the case in which the residual symmetry @xmath17 is @xmath84 .",
    "as we will see , this allows us to determine all physical phases and mixing angles in terms of a single real parameter @xmath2 . a small non - vanishing mixing angle @xmath20",
    "can then be accommodated by a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath2 and furthermore testable relations among the mixing parameters are predicted .",
    "once the flavour group @xmath0 has been chosen , several independent definitions of @xmath1 are in general possible , leading to physically distinct results . in this subsection",
    "we explain the setup and show the general form of the lepton mixing matrix , while we illustrate several interesting features with an explicit example based on the group @xmath7 in section [ sec3 ] .",

    "another possibility consists in reducing the residual symmetries in the neutrino and/or charged lepton sector . in this case",

    "we have considered a framework that is as predictive as possible , without necessarily requiring large discrete groups as starting point . following earlier ideas found in the literature , we have included @xmath1 in the set of symmetries of the theory and have analyzed which role @xmath1 could play in the symmetry breaking pattern . to define our framework",

    "this particular generalized @xmath1 transformation has already been studied in the literature .",
    "surprisingly , several cases lead to trivial cp phases . for such cases",
    "we have figured out the presence of accidental @xmath1 symmetries , not required a priori by the assumed symmetry breaking pattern . in order to illustrate a case",
    "in which all cp phases are non - trivial functions of the parameter @xmath2 , we have also discussed another case ( case iii ) , which however can not accommodate the best fit values of the mixing angles so well .",

    "we have discussed the model - independent implications of our proposal .",
    "physical results only depend on the assumed symmetry breaking pattern and are independent of the details of a specific implementation , such as the particle content of the flavour symmetry breaking sector or the possible additional symmetries of the theory .",
    "nevertheless we think that it would be interesting to implement one of the presented cases in an actual model , for example in a supersymmetric context in which the breaking of the symmetry group to @xmath16 and @xmath17 is spontaneous due to non - vanishing vacuum expectation values of some flavons .",
    "in such a model for case i or case iv the prediction of a maximal dirac phase @xmath30 for generic @xmath2 would not depend on the parameters of the theory and thus could represent a concrete realization of geometrical cp violation .",
    "apart from the usual challenge that corrections can spoil some of the leading order predictions , models in which the presented idea is implemented have to face another challenge , namely the prediction of the parameter @xmath2 which depends on the entries of the neutrino mass matrix , and whose size is important for accommodating the best fit values of the mixing angles well .",

    "@xmath47 and @xmath282 are subject to the same constraints as the matrices @xmath46 and @xmath281 , see eq.([diracnu ] ) , and thus @xmath47 and @xmath282 have to satisfy ( only ) [ cpdirac1 ] x_^ * ( m_^m_)^diag x_= ( m_^m_)^diag instead of eqs.([invcond],[condk ] ) . as a consequence , the most general form of @xmath282 fulfilling eq.([cpdirac1 ] ) for a non - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum",
    "is the same as for @xmath281 in eqs.([conddiag],[condxphases ] ) ( with @xmath284 called @xmath285 ) .",

    "in this appendix , we comment on the mathematical structure of the group comprising @xmath0 and @xmath1 and show that it is in general a semi - direct product .",

    "which group arises from combining the transformations of @xmath0 and those of @xmath37 , the parity group generated by @xmath1 , we enlarge the field space from @xmath38 to @xmath286 . in this space",
    "the actions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given by : =a  =x  , with [ calax ] a=          , respectively .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath287 generate a group which is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "the matrix @xmath288 satisfies x^2=  , [ xcond1 ] since @xmath35 is unitary and symmetric , and thus generates a group @xmath289 isomorphic to @xmath37 .",
    "we do not distinguish between two isomorphic groups and we use the same notation for both .",

    "then the subgroup @xmath37 is also normal .",
    "in the particular case @xmath7 , for which we discuss in detail the possible choices of @xmath35 as well as the phenomenological results for lepton mixing angles and cp phases in section [ sec3 ] , we find the following : among the various @xmath169 , see eqs.([admissx_1 ] , [ admissx_2 ] ) , only the canonical @xmath1 transformation @xmath243 leads to a direct product @xmath298 , because only in this case @xmath299 holds for all generators @xmath55 ( and thus all elements ) of @xmath19 ( we have used the fact that all representation matrices are real ) . in all the other cases @xmath300 is only satisfied for one or two of the three generators @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in particular , for @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 the relation @xmath299 obviously holds for @xmath304 and @xmath305 , whereas for @xmath306 we find @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 , respectively .",
