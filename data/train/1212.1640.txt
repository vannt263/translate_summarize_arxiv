    "analogous experiments performed for the proton case by the filtex collaboration @xcite at 23 mev and a recent cosy study where protons were scattering off a polarized hydrogen at 49 mev @xcite showed that indeed a polarized ( proton ) beam can be achieved via the so - called spin - filtering effect , i.e. by exploiting the fact that via the scattering process protons are removed ( lost ) from the ring at different rates for different initial polarization states @xcite . according to theoretical interpretations @xcite of the data @xcite",
    ", the polarization buildup effect appears solely due to the hadronic interaction of the incoming proton with the target .",
    "whereas the spin dependence of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) interaction is very well known at the considered energies , that allows one to calculate reliably the spin - filtering effect for protons , there is practically no corresponding information for the antiproton - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) interaction .",
    "for this reason a test experiment for the spin - filtering effect in the antiproton - hydrogen interaction is planned at the ad ring at the cern facility @xcite .    in view of the unknown spin dependence of the @xmath13 interaction , the interaction of antiprotons with a polarized deuteron",
    "is also of interest for the issue of the antiproton polarization buildup .",
    "this option was discussed in a previous paper by us @xcite . in that work",
    "the single - scattering approximation was used for the calculation of the polarized total @xmath0 cross sections for energies in the region 50300 mev .",
    "the spin dependence of the elementary @xmath1 amplitudes was taken into account in this approximation only in collinear kinematics using the @xmath9 interaction model of the jlich group @xcite .",

[ pd179ns10 ] . as a consequence , the second ( `` diffraction '' ) peak that appears in the full calculation , including now the ss and ds mechanisms , originates not only from the interference between the ss and ds amplitudes , as is usually the case for typical diffractive scattering , but is also related to that backward peak seen in the cross section of the ( elementary ) @xmath1 reaction .",

    "the tensor analyzing powers @xmath7 and @xmath8 are considerably reduced ( by one order of magnitude ) when the @xmath3-wave is neglected . actually , these observables practically vanish if , in addition , the spin - dependent terms of the elementary @xmath1 amplitude are omitted . for observables that exhibit a larger sensitivy to the @xmath3-wave component we performed also test calculations with the wave function of the paris potential which has a somewhat larger @xmath3-wave probability @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the sensitivity to differences in wave functions is , in general , fairly small . even in case of those tensor analyzing powers",

    "let us also mention that the values for the polarization degree we obtained are somewhat smaller than those presented in @xcite , based on the nijmegen @xmath12 partial wave analysis @xcite from 1994 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fmerit2 ] we document the dependence of the quantities @xmath192 and @xmath196 on the acceptance angle .",
    "as expected , in general the polarization degree increases with increasing acceptance angle .",
    "but the variations themselves are not too dramatic .",
    "in the present work we analyzed the role of the spin dependence of the @xmath13 amplitude in elastic @xmath0 scattering for energies of 50300 mev of the incident antiproton on the basis of the glauber theory . in the actual calculations we utilized elementary @xmath13 amplitudes generated from the jlich @xmath12 model @xcite . the @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave components of the deuteron",
    "were included into the calculation and the single- and double - scattering mechanisms were taken into account .    since some of the spin - dependent amplitudes exhibit a non - diffractive behaviour we performed various test calculations in order to pin down the angular range where the glauber theory can be reliably applied .",
    "thereby , it turned out that this approach works rather well for the region of the forward peak , over the whole considered energy region . obviously , for the considered @xmath121 models those amplitudes with non - diffractive character are fairly small as compared to the dominant spin - independent amplitude ( with a pronounced diffractive behaviour ) so that the former do not spoil the applicability of the glauber theory .",
    "this means , in turn , that the approach can be used savely for the calculation of the total spin - dependent @xmath0 cross sections via the optical theorem . with regard to the considered @xmath0 differential cross sections and vector- and tensor analyzing powers ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 )",
    "our investigation indicates that reliable predictions can be obtained for c.m .",
    "scattering angles up to @xmath140 in the @xmath0 system . for 179  mev ,",
    "where data on the differential cross section exist , this range covers the first minimum and the onset of the second maximum . here our results based on the @xmath1 amplitudes of the jlich model d turned out to agree nicely with the experiment while model a overestimates the measured @xmath0 cross section at the minimum .",
    "the total polarized @xmath0 cross sections @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) , and specifically , the polarization degree of the antiproton beam is of interest in the context of plans to establish a polarized antiproton beam via the spin - filtering method as proposed by the pax collaboration ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "corresponding predictions presented in this work , exhibit a sizable model dependence , reflecting the uncertainties in the spin dependence of the elementary @xmath111 and @xmath197 interactions .",
    "still , for both considered models we find that the magnitude of the spin - dependent cross sections is comparable or even larger than those for @xmath111 .",
    "thus , our results suggest that deuteron targets can be used for the polarization buildup of antiprotons at beam energies of 100300 mev with similar and possibly even higher efficiency than @xmath111 scattering .",
    "nonetheless , only concrete experimental data on the spin - dependent part of the cross sections of @xmath198 and @xmath0 scattering will allow one to confirm or disprove the feasibility of the spin filtering mechanism for the antiproton polarization buildup .",
