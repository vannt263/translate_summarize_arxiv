    "coherent control of a closed system induces a unitary transformation of the system density matrix @xmath11 and may have some limitations .",
    "the first limitation is due to the fact that unitary transformations of an operator preserve its spectrum ; thus the spectrum of @xmath2 is the same at any @xmath3 and , for example , a mixed state @xmath12 will always remain mixed  @xcite .",

    "the necessity to consider incoherent control relies also on the fact that coherent control of quantum systems ( e.g. , of chemical reactions ) in the laboratory is often realized in a medium ( solvent ) which interacts with the controlled system and plays the role of the environment .",

    "<S> conventional approaches for controlling open quantum systems use coherent control which affects the system s evolution through the hamiltonian part of the dynamics . such control , </S>",
    "<S> although being extremely efficient for a large variety of problems , has limited capabilities , e.g. , if the initial and desired target states have density matrices with different spectra or if a control field needs to be designed to optimally transfer different initial states to the same target state . </S>",
    "<S> recent research works suggest extending coherent control by including active manipulation of the non - unitary ( i.e. , incoherent ) part of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this paper summarizes recent results specifically for incoherent control by the environment ( e.g. , incoherent radiation or a gaseous medium ) with a kinematic description of controllability and landscape analysis . </S>"
