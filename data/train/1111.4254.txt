    "structure formation and evolution are thought to proceed via hierarchical merger events and accretion of smaller units to form larger systems driven by gravity with dark matter ( dm ) dominating the gravitational field .",
    "thus , merging plays a key role in driving the build - up of structures on both small and large scales .",
    "clusters are located at the crossing point of filamentary structures which drive the accretion towards their dm potential wells .",
    "accretion of smaller systems happens preferentially in the filaments and the products are , in turn , accreted by larger clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "investigating massive merging clusters implies having a snapshot of the regions of the universe where the highest - mass structures are created , which offers constraints and insights to both cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "indeed , the study of galaxy clusters allows not only to highlight the structure of the universe and to quantify several cosmological parameters but also to study the dynamics and evolution of the baryonic fraction in a deep potential well @xcite .    in most cases",
    "the dynamical state of clusters has been derived from x - ray observations ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray studies of merging clusters are useful to provide information on the evolution of the intra - cluster medium ( icm , e.g. @xcite ) , for example on how the icm is heated to the high observed temperatures and how entropy structure is generated ( @xcite , ) , in particular through the effect of shocks ( e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "merging events are detected by substructures in the surface brightness distribution of x - ray images ( e.g. ) . by their characterisation",
    "we are able to study the cluster dynamics and mass assembly history .",
    "for example , combining x - ray and spectroscopic information @xcite analysed the merging cluster abell  2744 .",
    "the identification of substructures was crucial to determine the merging direction and approximately establish the status of the core passage .",
    "however , accretion events can be also identified by considering all infalling groups in the proximity of a cluster @xcite and deriving their properties .",
    "these groups can be detected through the x - ray emission of their gas ( e.g. ) and through the distribution of galaxies and optical light .",
    "direct detection of x - ray emission from groups is not always feasible : indeed , small associations of a few galaxies are normally undetectable in x - rays @xcite due to their weak emission , and even richer groups , once captured by a massive cluster , are likely to lose almost all their gas .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the galaxies of accreted groups will give rise to significant galaxy over - densities within the parent cluster @xcite .",
    "combining these two complementary approaches makes it possible to explore the history of formation and evolution of clusters , where several snapshots of the accretion pattern are highlighted just by observing one cluster out to several times its radius .    in order to understand the role of merging in the evolution of clusters with similar mass and the connection with their large scale structure ( lss ) environment",
    "we need a sample of galaxy clusters with small mass range and different dynamical states . with this purpose",
    "we have selected a statistically complete cluster sample drawn from the rosat eso flux limited x - ray ( reflex ) survey .",
    "the 13 distant x - ray luminous ( dxl , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for details ) clusters have luminosity @xmath3 , masses @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius at which the density of a cluster is equal to @xmath8 times the critical density of the universe ( @xmath9 ) . throughout our analysis",
    "we adopt the x - ray estimate of @xmath7 ( unless it is otherwise specified ) . ] and are located within a narrow redshift interval ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the dxl sample is a powerful instrument to investigate the mass assembly of the clusters and the evolution of galaxies therein , together with the exploration of the link between large - scale structure , substructure and galaxy population .",
    "moreover , this snapshot of the universe is comparable to n - body simulations including hydrodynamics ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , allowing us to better investigate the physics that regulates cluster evolution across the cosmic web .",
    "for instance , one can understand the variation of the sub - halo mass function , traced by galaxies and the amount of substructure in clusters ; estimate time scales from the dynamical state of the gas ; and understand the physical processes that drive its behaviour .",
    "in fact , dxl can be represented as a sequence of cluster dynamical states , starting from early stages of merging events ( including several components of different mass ) towards strong cool core clusters .",
    "most of the detailed x - ray analysis of dxl clusters has been already performed ( @xcite , , @xcite , , hereafter referred to as z06 , ) .",
    "these studies , focused on the icm , have provided valuable information on the dynamical state , agn feedback and chemical enrichment of these clusters .",
    "optical analysis of the dxl sample has started in parallel .",
    "in particular , the attention was focused on two clusters with different dynamical states : an ongoing major merger and a relaxed cluster ( , hereafter referred to as b09 ) , in order to compare their kinematics and galaxy distributions with their x - ray properties . found , associated with the merging cluster a2744 , two large - scale filaments along which blue galaxies exhibited enhanced star formation activity .",
    "this study was followed up in b09 who explored the existing link between the fraction of passively evolving galaxies and the assembly state of the cluster",
    ". then suggested , from observations of three dxl clusters , that the intra cluster light has multiple origins , possibly linked to the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "in this paper we present the results from the study of rxcj1131.91955 ( alias abell 1300 ) , a post - merging cluster at @xmath11 with a `` dumbbell '' cd galaxy at its centre and prominent filaments visible in the galaxy density distribution .",
    "the definition of post - merging cluster dates back to who state that this cluster has undergone a merger but the merging phase may be nearly over .",

    "in addition , given the estimates of total luminosity for the two filaments ( cf .",

    "a1300 is a post - merging cluster at @xmath133 with a `` dumbbell '' cd galaxy at its centre and prominent filaments visible in the galaxy density distribution .",

    "as already found by b09 in other two dxl clusters ( and in the past in other clusters e.g. by @xcite ) , also a1300 hosts a centrally located population of galaxies dominated by an old , passively evolving stellar populations which define the red sequence .",
    "the study of the cmd enables us to measure the magnitude gap between the bcg and the second brightest galaxy .",
    "we can tentatively use it as a proxy on the dynamical state of the clusters ( as already done in greater detail for a sample of galaxy clusters by @xcite ) . table [",

    "this supports the conclusions by @xcite i.e. the time passed since the last major merger is directly reflected in the growth of the bcg ; in this way the magnitude gap increases with the ageing of the cluster .",
    "table [ mag_gap_table ] also provides information on the parameters of the best fitting line to the red sequence for the 3 dxl clusters .",
    "the red sequence fit in the cmd ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) allows us also to separate red and blue galaxies , for which we derive the galaxy density distribution ( fig .",
    "[ density_maps ] ) .",
    "the density contours of red galaxies reveal a vortex - like shape reminiscent of the temperature and the entropy features ( fig .",
    "[ entropy_map ] ) .",
    "the filamentary structures are highlighted mostly by the red galaxies departing from the central region of the cluster and extending beyond @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests that infalling galaxies have already evolved before starting their infall towards a1300 , possibly in former groups embedded in the surrounding feeding filaments .",
    "in fact , the gravitational potential well of the groups could affect the evolution of their galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the extent to which galaxies are pre - processed in groups before falling into clusters depends on the mass of galaxies @xcite , suggesting that massive galaxies are more easily segregated in the group halos .",
    "a possible shock front ( consistent with a mach number @xmath114 ) was also identified in the southern part of the cluster coincident with a candidate relic ( @xcite and @xcite ) found in the radio bands .",
    "radio halos are diffuse radio emission located at the centre of clusters , while relics are usually elongated or arc - shaped and found in the peripheral regions of clusters ( e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "most of the merging clusters host both radio halo and relics @xcite , likely originated by acceleration of electrons through shocks and turbulence @xcite .",
    "the mach number that we find from the surface brightness profile is consistent with a shock originating from a merging of two progenitors with comparable mass @xcite . the gas motion after the merging could have played an important role though .",
    "surprisingly also the galaxy distribution exhibits a sharp edge in the sw .",
    "this coupled conduct of gas and galaxies is also visible in the analysis of the temperature and entropy maps . in particular , we overlaid the density contours of the red galaxies of the cluster ( mostly populating the inner region ) which nicely follow the entropy ( and temperature ) features , suggesting that the galaxies track the information provided by the gas in the central region out to larger cluster - centric radii .",
    "the projection effects combined with the status of the merging play an important role as , to our knowledge , there is no other cluster with a spiral like shape and the galaxy density distribution which reminds the gas temperature or entropy map .",
    "@xcite performed simulations of cluster merging starting with two cool core clusters with different masses and total mass distributions ( gas and dark matter ) represented by a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw , @xcite ) profile .",
    "the status of a1300 seems to be represented by one of the simulations where two parent clusters of approximately the same mass ( @xmath135 ) are approaching one another with an initial impact parameter @xmath136 ( fig .  4 for simulation s2 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility represented by the same simulation with an impact parameter @xmath137 ( fig .  5 for simulation s3 in @xcite ) .",
    "in these simulation the gas cores do not collide at the first core passage but sideswipe , creating a bridge of stripped , low entropy gas that stretches between the two dm cores .",
    "in fact , as high entropy gas floats and low - entropy gas sinks , the low entropy region marks the positions of the core of the cluster progenitors and the high entropy is due to the presence of shocks . the entropy map of the simulation finds a pretty good correspondence to the projected entropy map of a1300 : here one plume of cold gas is located in correspondence of the bcg , showing up as a low entropy channel in the central region of the cluster , surrounded by higher entropy gas ( with a characteristic whirlpool shape ) .",
    "the absence of a symmetric plume could be due to the fact that just one of the two cluster progenitors was a cool core ( whose central part still survive at the centre of a1300 ) similarly massive .",
    "the other entropy plume is located to the north and is not compact as the previous one .",
    "this could be an indication that a1300 is a complex system in which minor mergers played an important role in the mass assembly and the major merger happened between clusters of different dynamical states .",
    "the comparison with these aforementioned simulations of @xcite , even if the matching is not perfect , allows us to approximately date the merging of the cluster progenitors : about 3 @xmath138 gyr could have passed since when their regions within @xmath95 touched for the first time . tentatively tracing the previous cores in the entropy map , we can estimate the current projected impact angle which is likely to be @xmath139 in the plane of the sky .",
    "this suggests that we are witnessing an almost face - on merging of clusters which allow us to better understand the status of the system related to the projection effects : as in the simulations , the two clusters collide with a relatively low initial impact parameter and after the first core passage the low entropy regions trace the two progenitors .",
    "moreover , the presence of the shock found in the same position of the radio relic suggests that more than 2 gyr passed since the merging ; its weakness ( @xmath114 ) could constrain the age of the merging to around 3 gyr .",
    "furthermore , the degree of gas mixing as a function of radius ( fig .",
    "13 for simulation s2 or s3 in @xcite ) is very efficient in the off - axis merging , because the cores feel their mutual interaction and are stripped before the final merging .",
    "the disturbed shape of the x - ray entropy , temperature and surface brightness 2-d distributions reflect a high degree of substructure in the cluster , fundamental for the interpretation of different moments of the assembly history .",
    "the surface brightness , in fact , is asymmetric ( fig .",
    "[ psf_rec_dens_maps ] ) and exhibits some excess of emission due to the influence of the filamentary structure through which groups fall .",
    "there is a mutual perturbation among the cluster and the infalling groups which keep their identities while they experience the attraction of the cluster , as appears evident from the analysis of the red and blue galaxy fractions as a function of position and luminosity ( appendix a ) .",
    "the substructures found in a1300 show several episodes of accretion : a filament shows up in the ds - test ( fig .",
    "[ dstest ] ) and in the galaxy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ density_maps ] ) we detect groups entering into the virial region of the cluster ( fig .  [ psf_rec_dens_maps ] ) and over - densities in the inner part of the cluster without an x - ray identification .",
    "the last case refers to some peaks that we observe inside @xmath95 by the density map .",
    "in fact , when a group enters in a cluster , it is stripped almost immediately of its hot gas @xcite",
    ". conversely , group galaxies can keep orbiting around the cluster centre for some time even after being captured in the deep potential well .",
    "thus , they may retain part of their common dm halo remaining effectively bound together for longer times and appearing as galaxy over - densities .",
    "this happens mainly because of the difference in the behaviour of collisional and non - collisional components of clusters or groups ( galaxies and icm respectively ) as explained for example by @xcite .",
    "moreover , we compared the velocity distributions of the northern and southern components ( both at a distance larger than 1 mpc from the core ) of the cluster . the ne filament ( in which the group 4 is embedded , fig .",
    "[ group_snapshots_and_cmd ] , corresponding to the northern red circles of the ds test , fig",

    "the observer while the southern one ( in which is embedded the group 10 , fig .  [ group_snapshots_and_cmd ] , corresponding to the southern red circles of the ds test , fig .  [ dstest ] ) appears approaching to us . in this way",
    "we are able to give a three dimensional picture of the mass assembly history using all data available .",
    "the substructure analysis revealed also that the total mass of our x - ray selected groups is around 20% of that of the cluster .",
    "one of them ( group 4 , @xmath140 ) is already embedded in the virial region of the cluster ( also in terms of gas , as it is possible to see from the x - ray emission in fig .",
    "[ psf_rec_dens_maps ] ) and contributes alone to half of this value .",
    "this confirms the relation suggested by a recent simulation @xcite , i.e. that richness of the largest subgroup is typically 20% of that of its host cluster ( even if this relation exhibits a wide scatter ) .",
    "[ bcg_fig ] shows the elongated shape of the galaxy distribution in the central region of the cluster , compared with the x - ray emission : the brightest galaxies , together with their satellites , trace the disturbed x - ray emission .",
    "a bit further from the central emission of the gas we detect groups both in the x - rays and in the optical bands ( as galaxy concentration ) .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness ( better investigated in the psf reconstructed image , fig .",
    "[ psf_rec_dens_maps ] ) appears elliptical at the centre but a projected filament to the south suggests the direction of a past accretion event .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness appears elongated towards the direction of the filaments in which the infalling groups are embedded , thus the ongoing mergers will modify again the shape of the cluster as it happens in the north - east .",
    "combining all the available information , a1300 could have been the result of the merging of two clusters of similar mass .",
    "the collision happened most likely with a small impact parameter ( as inferred from the entropy and the temperature maps ) and this shock heated the gas , yielding all the features visible in x - rays .",
    "a1300 still accretes via filaments and groups , which suggests that this cluster is still in the formation process ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed",
    ", it could be experiencing a relaxation at the observed time , just after the merging , in which the gas starts settling down and the different components mix .",

    "the distribution of the red galaxies of the cluster ( mostly concentrated at the centre ) exhibits a marked correspondence with the entropy ( and temperature ) features , suggesting that the galaxies track the information provided by the gas in the central region out to larger cluster - centric radii .",
    "the projection effects combined with the status of the merging play an important role in this configuration . *",
    "the x - ray surface brightness distribution is clearly affected by the presence of filamentary structures through which groups enter the virial radius of the cluster . *",

    "it is thus possible to study different stages of a merging even by analysing a single cluster : a1300 is a good example for this purpose as it shows a filament through which it accretes not only individual galaxies but also groups ; disrupted ones visible in the optical but not any more in x - rays and other groups still in the process of crossing @xmath95 .",

    "this over - density is the most significant : its bgg ( the most luminous with respect to other groups ) coincides with the centre of the x - ray emission and its density clearly stands up at more than 3@xmath107 above the density of the background .",
    "this group could be still not part of the system or it could be so close to the cluster just for a projection effect , due to a possible large scale filamentary structure pointing towards the observer @xcite .",
