    "the study of mathematical models for human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection is a subject of strong current interest , both at population and cell levels ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "based on the model of @xcite , in this work we analyze a mathematical model that studies the relationship between hiv and the immune system during the natural course of infection and in the context of antiviral treatment regimes .",

    "for this reason , in this work we introduce a discrete time - delay into the model , which represents the incubation period , that is , the time between the new infection of a @xmath0 t cell and the time it becomes infectious ( section  [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "we prove local asymptotic stability of the viral free and infected equilibriums , for any time delay ( section  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "optimal control theory has been applied with success to epidemiology hiv models : see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . however , epidemiology optimal control problems with delays in both state and control variables are a rarity .",
    "for one such optimal control problem , of a tuberculosis model , we refer the reader to the recent work of silva , maurer and torres @xcite .",
    "here , we propose and solve a hiv optimal control problem , with delays in both state and control variables , where the objective is to find the optimal treatment strategy that maximizes the number of @xmath0 t cells , as well as ctl immune response cells , keeping the drug / chemotherapy strength , which depends on a pharmacological delay , as low as possible ( section  [ sec : oc ] ) . the stability and optimal control results of sections  [ sec:3 ] and [ sec : oc ] are then illustrated through numerical simulations in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
