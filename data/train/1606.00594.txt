    "observations of 2@xmath4 neutron star  @xcite sparked a renewed interest for the eos of dense nuclear matter at large iso - spin asymmetry  @xcite . in the low - density limit , the nuclear matter can be regarded as a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles filled up to their respective quasi - fermi sea . in such a limit",
    ", the early appearance of the hyperon will make the matter soft because the additional degrees of freedom can be filled in the matter without enhancing the quasi - fermi sea .",
    "model calculations tend to show that such a soft eos will not support a 2@xmath4 neutron star  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is generally believed that the hyperon degrees of freedom will eventually become repulsive at high dense matter due to the interactions between nucleon and hyperon , which can lead to a stiff eos at high nuclear matter density .",
    "even if the nuclear matter is strongly correlated , the appearance of hyperon degrees of freedom usually reduces the energy density of the matter and the maximum mass of the neutron star becomes bounded to values smaller than 2@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "hence , the density behavior of the nucleon as well as the hyperon are of great current interest .    as for the nucleon , the density dependence the quasineutron energy in the asymmetric nuclear matter is characterized by the nuclear symmetry energy  @xcite",
    ". the nuclear matter energy density will have an additional variation axis if the matter includes a nontrivial fraction of hyperons .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to calculate the eos of the dense matter in the hadron phase directly from first principle or from models with relevant effective degrees of freedom because experimental information on these is scare at present .",
    "hopefully , worldwide plans for rare isotope machines that can probe the symmetry energy may improve the situation . until more experimental data are available , effective method based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "can be an alternative approach to directly calculate the properties of quasibaryons at high density .",
    "the operator - product - expansion ( ope - based ) spectral sum rule ( qcd sum rules ) is a well established method for investigating the properties of hadrons  @xcite . through the ope in qcd degrees of freedom",
    ", the nonperturbative qcd contribution at confined phase can be systematically included into the spectral structure of hadron resonance in both the vacuum and nuclear medium .",
    "using theoretical estimates and the results of experimental measurements for the nuclear expectation values of condensates , qcd sum - rules methods have been successfully applied to study nucleons  @xcite and vector mesons  @xcite in the nuclear medium .",
    "however , a systematic qcd sum - rule study for the in - medium properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons using a generalized interpolating fields and updated condensate values is still missing .",
    "although the sum rules have been updated by using some of the condensate values extracted from theoretical development including lattice qcd  @xcite , additional assumptions have to be made for the result to be consistent with existing experimental observations from the @xmath1 and @xmath0 hyper - nuclei  @xcite .    in previous studies , the interpolating fields for hyperons",
    "have been obtained via su(3 ) flavor transformation from the well established ioffe choice for the nucleon interpolating fields  @xcite .",
    "but in principle , an independent basis for interpolating fields can be freely constructed as long as it has the required quantum numbers of the hadron of interest .",
    "therefore , the generalized interpolating fields would be a linear combination of the basis set with parameters specifying the strength of the independent basis .",
    "an optimal interpolating field will reflect the dominant quark configuration of the ground state and thus have a large overlap with the ground state .",
    "if the parameter set are close to the optimal choice , the sum rule would be stable under small variations in the parameters , whereas an unfavorable choice will be reflected in an unstable sum rule .    in this study",
    ", we review the construction scheme of the interpolating fields without derivatives for the neutron and @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons and constructed a general interpolating field for each baryon with parameters specifying the strength of independent bases . optimal choices for the interpolating fields were obtained by requiring the sum rules to be stable against variations of the parameters and the result to be consistent with known phenomenology .",
    "the self - energies and the energy of the quasibaryon states and their density behavior have been calculated by the qcd sum - rules approach with the renewed interpolating fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , a brief introduction for in - medium qcd sum rules and arguments for constructing interpolating fields are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , detailed ope for correlation functions are given , and the treatment for in medium condensates are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , the sum rules for the neutron , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 baryons in the neutron matter are analyzed .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the bjorken limit , the scattering amplitude of a hadron and leptons can be calculated by the ope of the correlation function between explicit quark currents , which overlaps with the partonic configuration in the hadron .",
    "this means that the quantum number of a hadron can be interpolated with explicit quark current from the qcd lagrangian .",
    "moreover , the ope calculation in the qcd degrees of freedom is justified in this limit .",
    "one can also study the properties of a hadron by constructing the corresponding spectral sum rules by using the ope of the current - current correlation function which contains the hadron state as the ground state .",
    "this type of approach is based on the short distance expansion and requires following assumptions :    * _ the interpolating fields should be constructed to have the quantum number of the hadron of interest and chosen to have a strong overlap with it .",
    "_ * _ among the states that appear in the correlator , the hadron state should be a well separated ground state .",

    "the state is characterized by its density @xmath8 , the matter velocity @xmath9 , and the iso - spin asymmetry factor @xmath10 . with assumed parity , time - reversal symmetry , and lorentz covariance",

    ", the invariants can be decomposed into an even and an odd part of @xmath19 , where each part has the following dispersion relation at fixed @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are even functions of @xmath19 .",
    "if one regards the baryon in the nuclear medium as a quasiparticle state , the nuclear interaction can be accounted for as the in - medium self - energies within the mean - field potential .",
    "the phenomenological structure of the correlation function near the quasibaryon pole can then be suggested as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the residue at the quasibaryon pole , which accounts for the overlap between the interpolating fields and the quasi - baryon state .",
    "the invariants can then be identified as follows : @xmath30    on the other hand , the invariants can be expressed in terms of qcd degrees of freedom by ope in following limit : @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( equivalent to @xmath33 , @xmath32 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the wilson coefficients , and the condensate part @xmath36 has been evaluated within the linear density approximation .    depending on the quantum number and the intrinsic structure of the ground - state hadron , construction of the interpolating fields should be different . in the following section",

    "near the separation scale of the ope , for which the mass scale of the low - lying baryon ( @xmath55 ) is taken , the light quark mass is negligible .",
    "hence , for the light quarks , the perturbative propagation preserves helicity . however , because the strange quark mass is non - negligible compared with the separation scale , the strange quark propagation can mix helicity : the helicity mixing part is proportional to the strange quark mass . in the nonperturbative regime ,",
