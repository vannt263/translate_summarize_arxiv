    "despite our ignorance of the nature of dark matter , numerous techniques have been developed in an effort to detect it @xcite .",
    "indeed , if the dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , as is suggested by our theoretical prejudices , it will have a tiny but non - vanishing probability of interacting with the ordinary matter of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in addition to collider searches , direct and indirect detection techniques have been devised to search for particle dark matter . in the case of direct detection ,",
    "one attempts to measure the recoil energy of target nuclei in an underground detector due to its elastic scattering with a wimp .",
    "thousands of wimps are expected to cross each square centimeter every second at the surface of the earth .",
    "we could potentially detect up to a few tens of events per year at near future detectors , depending on the precise interactions of the wimp .",
    "the goal of indirect detection techniques on the other hand , is to detect a flux of cosmic rays resulting from the annihilation of wimps in regions such as the galactic center , the galactic halo , or the interior of the sun .",
    "these annihilations can produce potentially observable fluxes of gamma - rays , neutrinos , positrons , anti - protons and anti - deuterons .    given the abundance of experimental activity related to dark matter detection",
    ", it is timely to study the distinctive signatures expected in different dark matter scenarios .",
    "such signatures and event rates can vary substantially from one wimp model to another .",
    "the most studied candidate so far is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in models of r - parity conserving supersymmetry .",
    "some alternatives to neutralinos and other lsps do exist , however . lately , the possibility of kaluza ",
    "klein dark matter has been explored . while the idea that dark matter could be made of kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) particles is very tempting , it turns out that this is not so easy to achieve . indeed , in most extra - dimensional models , there are no stable kk states , all being able to decay to sm particles .",
    "an exception is the class of models in universal extra dimensions ( ued ) @xcite . in this case , all sm fields propagate in flat toroidal extra dimensions .",
    "translation invariance along an extra dimension is only broken by the orbifold imposed to recover a chiral sm spectrum .",
    "still , there is a remnant discrete symmetry called kk parity , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kk number .",
    "this symmetry insures that interaction vertices can not involve an odd number of odd - kk states and , therefore , a vertex with two sm particles ( with @xmath4 ) and one kk state ( with @xmath5 ) is forbidden . as a result",
    ", the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) with @xmath5 can not decay into sm particles and is stable .",
    "for @xmath6tev@xmath7 sized extra dimensions , the lkp can act as a wimp .",
    "relic density @xcite , direct @xcite and indirect detection @xcite studies of this candidate have all been carried out in the last few years .",
    "constraints on these models from radion cosmology have also been studied @xcite .",
    "the second example of kk dark matter arises in the context of warped geometries and more specifically in the context of warped grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite . to locate these constructions in the landscape of extra dimensional models ,",
    "recall that the interest in the phenomenology of extra dimensions over the last few years has been motivated by the goal of understanding the weak scale .",
    "the only extra - dimensional geometry which really addresses the hierarchy problem is the randall - sundrum geometry .",
    "particle physics model building in this framework has been flourishing and a favorite class of models has emerged : that where all sm fields propagate in the bulk of ads@xmath8 , except for the higgs ( or alternative physics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ) which is localized on the ir brane . in addition , the electroweak gauge group should be extended to @xmath9 .",
    "those models were embedded into a gut in refs .",
    "@xcite and it is in this context that a viable dark matter appears .    in these models , a stable kk fermion can arise as a consequence of imposing proton stability in a way very reminiscent to r - parity stabilizing the lsp in supersymmetric models .",
    "the symmetry is called @xmath10 and is a linear combination of baryon number and @xmath11 color .",
    "it actually exists in the sm but sm particles are not charged under it since only colored particles carry baryon number in the sm . in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more generally in higher dimensional guts , baryon number can be assigned in such a way that there exists exotic kk states with the gauge quantum numbers of a lepton and which carry baryon number as well as kk quarks which carry non - standard baryon number .",
    "these particles carry a non - zero @xmath10 charge .",
    "the lightest of these , called the lightest @xmath10 particle ( lzp ) , is stable since it can not decay into sm particles .",
    "the only massive elementary dirac fermion ( with a mass in the 1 gev - 1 tev range ) which could be a viable dark matter candidate is the neutrino .",
    "if such a neutrino had the same coupling to the @xmath12 as in the sm , however , it would be excluded by direct detection experiments .",
    "its coupling to the @xmath12 , therefore , must be suppressed .",
    "thus , we are left with the possibility of a kk right - handed ( rh ) neutrino . in models where the electroweak gauge group is extended to @xmath9 ,",
    "the rh neutrino has gauge interactions in particular with the additional @xmath13",
    ". nevertheless , its interactions with ordinary matter are feeble because they involve the additional gauge bosons which have a large mass ( @xmath14 tev ) .",
    "this opens the possibility of a weakly interacting dirac rh neutrino .    in this work",
    ", we present the prospects for the indirect detection of right - handed neutrino dark matter , based on the particular example of the lzp . in section [ lzppresentation ] , we will present the properties of this particle , how it gets its mass and how it interacts with ordinary matter .",
    "section [ sec : sun ] deals with the predictions for the detection of neutrinos generated in annihilation of the lzp in the sun .",
    "signatures due to cosmic positrons from annihilation in the galactic halo are presented in section [ sec : positrons ] and gamma - rays from annihilation in the galactic center in section [ sec : gc ] .",
    "we summarize our results and make comparisons with lsp and lkp dark matter candidates in the following section .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the lzp arises as a viable dark matter candidate in warped guts .",
    "an interesting feature of these models is that gut states such as @xmath15 gauge bosons appear at the tev scale ( via the kk excitations ) . in @xmath16 , there are also the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath13 , etc . that the lzp can couple to .",
    "the lzp is a kaluza ",
    "klein fermion , which is a four - component spinor and vector - like object .",
    "it gets its mass by marrying the left - handed with the right - handed chirality . as explained in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be naturally very light , much lighter than the kk scale of randall - sundrum models , namely @xmath19 3 tev .",
    "this is because the rh chirality is localized near the tev brane while the lh one is near the planck brane .",
    "the overlap of wave functions is small , resulting in a small dirac kk mass .",
    "its lightness is related to the top quark s heaviness but not entirely fixed by it , so that we will consider lzps in the mass range of approximately 20 gev to a few tev . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the lzp as if it were a chiral fermion because only the rh chirality has significant interactions and the other chirality decouples .",
    "in addition , the lzp has the same gauge quantum numbers as the rh neutrino of @xmath16 or pati  salam . as a result",
    ", we refer to it as a  dirac rh neutrino \" and denote it as @xmath20 .",
    "the lzp couples to the tev kk gauge bosons of @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , when electroweak symmetry is broken , @xmath21 mixing induces a coupling of the rh neutrino to the sm @xmath12 gauge boson .",
    "this coupling is suppressed by @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 few tev ( the mass of kk gauge bosons is set by @xmath24 ) , the size of this coupling will typically be ideal for a wimp .",
    "there is actually a second source for the @xmath12-lzp coupling , which we will not discuss here but refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed explanation .",
    "we denote @xmath25 as the coupling of @xmath26 to the z. there is enough freedom in the model under consideration to treat this coupling as an almost arbitrary parameter . as far as indirect detection is concerned , three phenomenological quantities are especially important : the annihilation cross section of the lzp , the fraction of annihilations which produce various sm particles and the lzp s elastic scattering cross section with nuclei ( for the wimp s capture in the sun ) .",

    "if lzps are heavier and annihilate mostly to top quarks , or gauge and higgs bosons , positrons will be produced in the subsequent decay chains , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , etc . the resulting spectrum , for a 400 gev lzp annihilating to @xmath65 , is shown in figure  [ pos400 ] .",
    "although no highly distinctive features are present in this spectrum , it may still be possible to statistically identify such a spectrum over the background prediction .",
    "@xmath62/s , a local dark matter density of @xmath123(local)=0.4 gev/@xmath62 and a boost factor of 10 .",
    "the solid line is the background - only prediction.,width=336 ]    other anti - matter channels for indirect dark matter searches have been studied as well , namely cosmic anti - proton and anti - deuteron studies .",
    "although such searches are indeed interesting , they sample over considerably larger regions of the galactic halo , making the choice of diffusion zone boundary conditions and halo profile models very important .",
    "these ambiguities make predictions of anti - proton and anti - deuteron spectra from dark matter annihilations difficult to reliably calculate .",
    "lzp annihilations can produce high - energy gamma - rays through the hadronization and decay of pions generated in the cascading of their annihilation products .",
    "in addition to this continuum emission , lzp annihilations can also produce @xmath130 and @xmath131 final states , for example from box diagrams with a @xmath132 along one side and @xmath133 along the other three .",
    "such processes would yield the very distinctive feature of mono - energetic gamma - ray lines , although with a much smaller cross section than for continuum emission .",
    "the full cross sections for these processes have not yet been calculated for this model . for these reasons",
    ", we will focus on continuum gamma - rays in this section .    unlike positrons and other charged particles , cosmic gamma - rays travel in straight lines and can travel greater distances without energy loss .",
    "for these reasons , regions of the galaxy which are expected to have higher concentrations of dark matter ( and higher annihilation rates ) can be studied with gamma - ray telescopes without integrating over the entire galactic volume . in particular ,",
    "the galactic center is a promising region for such observations .",
    "the @xmath134-ray flux from dark matter annihilations near the galactic center is given by @xmath135 here , @xmath136 is the angle between the line - of - sight ( los ) and the galactic center , @xmath137 is the lzp annihilation cross - section and @xmath138 is the dark matter density at distance , @xmath139 , from the galactic center .",
    "@xmath140 is the spectrum of continuum gamma - rays produced in each annihilation .",
    "this expression can be further separated into two factors , one specifying the particle physics model ( mass , cross - section and fragmentation spectrum ) and another describing the dark matter distribution .",
    "normalizing to the distance to the galactic center and the local halo dark matter density , the latter factor can be written as : @xmath141    defining @xmath142 as the average of @xmath143 over the solid angle @xmath144 ( centered on @xmath145 ) , we can write @xmath146 for a standard navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo profile , averaged over a solid angle of @xmath147 sr , we calculate a value of @xmath148 .",
    "this can vary considerably with halo model , however .",
    "for example , with a moore _",
    "et al _ profile @xcite , we calculate a much larger value of @xmath149 . if the effects of adiabatic compression or accretion onto the central supermassive black hole are taken into account , even larger values can be found @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of gamma - rays predicted from lzp annihilations is shown in figure  [ gammaspec ] .",
    "this result is not substantially different than what would be expected from the annihilation of neutralinos or other wimps .",
    "also , recent observations of a gamma - ray spectrum extending above @xmath610 tev may pose serious challenges to identifying any potential gamma - ray signal from wimp annihilations @xcite , assuming that this is not in fact the annihilation signature of a very heavy wimp @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we do not further discuss the gamma - ray indirect detection channel here .",

    "in this section , we briefly summarize the phenomenological features relevant to dark matter detection for an lzp dirac rh neutrino and compare these features to those of the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models and the first kaluza - klein excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson in models with universal extra dimensions .",
    ": lzps can generate the observed quantity of dark matter thermally in two mass ranges : near the @xmath12-resonance ( @xmath151 35 - 50 gev ) and for considerably heavier masses ( @xmath152 several hundred gev ) @xcite .",
    "neutralinos can span a very wide range of masses , although in the models most often studied , they fall in the range of 50 - 1000 gev .",
    "the lkp in ued models requires a mass in the range of 700 - 900 gev in order to generate the observed thermal relic density , unless other kk modes participate in the freeze - out process @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , somewhat smaller masses are possible .",
    "a recent analysis , taking into account the effects of second level kk modes , indicates that the upper edge of this mass range is favored @xcite . in any case , we should keep in mind that the precise prediction of the lkp relic density depends on the particular kk mass spectrum which is used and is somewhat model - dependent .    :",
    "if any of these dark matter candidates generate the observed relic density thermally , they must have an annihilation cross section of @xmath153 @xmath62/s evaluated at the freeze - out temperature .",
    "for the purpose of indirect detection , we are interested in the annihilation cross section in the low velocity limit , which does not necessarily equal the value at freeze - out , however . for most of the parameter space in this model , these two cross sections",
    "are not considerably different . in ued models , they are always the same . for neutralinos ,",
    "this issue depends on the composition of the lsp and the spectrum of other supersymmetric particles . for the case of neutralino annihilation through s - channel pseudoscalar higgs exchange to fermion pairs , as",
    "if often the dominant channel for bino - like lsps , the cross section at freeze - out will be very similar to the value at low velocities .",
    ": the leading annihilation channels for lzps are shown in fig .",
    "[ annfrac ] .",
    "below 100 gev , annihilations to light quarks , neutrinos and charged leptons are important . at higher masses , @xmath65 , @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath154 channels dominate . in ued models ,",
    "about 20% of lkp annihilations go to charged lepton pairs of each family . about 1.2%",
    "go to each flavor of neutrino pairs .",
    "the remaining annihilations go to quarks and higgs bosons .    for neutralinos ,",
    "again the composition and susy spectrum are important in predicting the dominant annihilation modes . for a bino - like lsp , annihilations to @xmath155 , @xmath121 and ,",
    "if kinematically allowed , @xmath65 usually dominate . for winos and higgsinos , annihilations to gauge and higgs bosons are often important . since neutralinos are majorana fermions , their annihilations to light fermions are chirality suppressed , unlike for the lzp and lkp .",
    ": lzp capture in the sun can be dominated by spin - dependent scattering with hydrogen nuclei ( protons ) or by scalar scattering with helium nuclei .",
    "the size of these cross sections can vary a great deal , depending on the choices of parameters .",
    "in particular , the scale @xmath107 ( mass of kk gauge bosons ) plays a very important role .",
    "the bounds on the spin - independent cross section placed by the cdms experiment @xcite are often exceeded for smaller values of @xmath156 34 tev @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , values as small as @xmath157 pb are possible for @xmath15610 tev .    for neutralinos , these cross sections can vary from in excess of the cdms bound , to as small as @xmath158 pb , although in constrained models , they often fall in the range of @xmath108@xmath159 pb . in ued models , spin - dependent scattering dominates lkp capture in the sun , with cross sections of @xmath160@xmath161 pb .",
    "in this article , we have studied the prospects for the detection of a stable , right - handed , dirac neutrino which can emerge in grand unified models in a randall - sundrum spacetime . after introducing into the model a @xmath10 symmetry necessary to ensure proton stability , the lightest @xmath10 charged particle ( lzp ) is stable and a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "we have studied the indirect detection prospects for such a particle through three channels : neutrinos produced through annihilations in the sun , positrons produced through annihilations in the galactic halo and gamma - rays produced through annihilations in the galactic center .",
    "the prospects for detecting high - energy neutrinos from the sun in this model are very encouraging . for a light lzp in this model ( @xmath63 gev )",
    ", annihilations often produce neutrinos directly",
    ". the currently operating amanda experiment may already be sensitive to some of these models . in the future",
    ", the antares experiment will further probe into this region . for heavier lzps , annihilations to top quark pairs produce neutrinos efficiently in their decays .",
    "the kilometer - scale experiment icecube , currently under construction , should be sensitive to most of these models in which the kaluza - klein scale , @xmath107 , is lower than @xmath162 tev ( a favorite range as far as fine - tuning in the electroweak sector is concerned ) .",
    "lighter lzps also generate positrons very efficiently .",
    "a 3550 gev lzp annihilating in the galactic halo produces a spectrum of positrons which matches the spectrum observed by the heat experiment quite well , and with more moderate annihilation rates than for neutralino dark matter . at an energy equal to the lzp mass",
    ", a discrete feature appears in the positron spectrum which , if identified in future experiments such as pamela and ams-02 , would provide an unambiguous signature of dark matter annihilations .    finally , lzp annihilations near the galactic center may provide an observable flux of gamma - rays .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum of gamma - rays in this model and find that is it not considerably different than for the case of annihilating neutralinos .",
    "these results could be generalized to other dirac rh neutrino dark matter particles , though it is not clear in which other contexts such a particle would naturally arise . in 4d",
    ", this would require the addition of vector - like neutrinos very weakly coupled to sm gauge bosons but interacting via an extra @xmath163 .",
    "the coupling of sm fermions to this extra @xmath163 should be suppressed to keep their coupling to the @xmath12 ( due to @xmath12-@xmath13 mixing ) almost unshifted .",
    "it is also unclear what would make this particle stable in this context .",
    "note , however , that via the ads / cft correspondence , our randall - sundrum scenario is dual to a 4d composite higgs scenario , in which the unification of gauge couplings has recently been studied @xcite . in this case , the lzp maps to some low - lying hadron at the composite scale .",
    "we also point out that in refs .",
    "@xcite , the strong coupling scale is close to the curvature scale so that @xmath164 variations in our calculations are expected .",
    "these results should therefore be considered as representative rather than a complete description .",
    "annihilations can vary from one dirac rh neutrino dark matter model to another , depending on whether , at large @xmath20 mass , annihilations take place via s - channel @xmath13 exchange only or also via a t - channel @xmath18type gauge boson . on the other hand ,",
    "the elastic scattering cross section is mainly model - independent ( determined by the @xmath165 coupling ) .",
