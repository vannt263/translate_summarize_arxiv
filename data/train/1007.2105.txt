    "the understanding and control of the decoherence of small quantum systems is central to a lot of recent developments in the fields of nanotechnology and quantum computers @xcite .",
    "for example , the efficacy of qubits , the basic building block of a quantum computer , which can be spin qubits , josephson junction qubits , charge or flux qubits depends largely on the environments , or baths , to which they are often weakly coupled .",
    "the effect of environments on the coherence of the qubit has been studied in various contexts with particular emphasis on bosonic baths @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", the realization of solid state qubits in semiconducting heterojunctions has also resulted in the study of spin baths constituted of spins . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the decoherence engendered by a spin environment is expected to dominate the loss of the coherence arising from a coupling to phononic degrees of freedom .    in the limit of weak coupling between the qubit and the bath , the effect of intrabath interactions",
    "have been explored earlier in other works @xcite . in some cases",
    ", interactions were found to decrease the rate of decoherence , though the exact opposite was seen in cases where the spin bath was on the verge of a standard magnetic quantum phase transition @xcite . on the other hand , the qualitative nature of the decoherence i.e. , whether it is markovian or non - markovian depends largely on the nature of the initial state of the bath@xcite . for baths at zero temperature , the decoherence is often non - markovian .",
    "examples include the well known spin - boson model @xcite , and models of interacting spin environments that we already mentioned above @xcite .",
    "it has also been found in the case of a qubit interacting via the fermi contact hyperfine coupling with a bath of polarized nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "for baths in thermal equilibrium i.e. , at _ finite temperatures _ , the decoherence in the weak coupling limit is expected to be markovian as in the case of the spin - boson model .",
    "this aspect was also seen in the case of interacting spin baths at finite temperatures@xcite .",
    "the associated markovian decay rate was also found to increase with temperature and , unlike the case of bosons , was found to saturate at high enough temperatures .",
    "since interactions between spins in condensed matter systems are known to generate a whole range of complex thermodynamic behaviours , it is interesting to ask whether interactions between the bath spins generate novel behaviour for the coherence of a qubit coupled to such a bath . in this general context ,",
    "various questions arise naturally : does the decoherence contain clear signals about the underlying thermodynamic phase of the bath ?",
    "is markovian decay to be expected for all interacting spin environments at _ finite temperatures _",
    ", where the bath is in a statistical mixture at temperature @xmath0 , and not in a pure state @xcite ? and can decoherence or others physical quantities asociated with the qubit be used as a sensitive probe of the dynamics of the underlying spin environment ?    here , we shall explore some of these issues by considering the problem of the decoherence of a qubit induced by weak coupling to a model spin - bath with non - trivial dynamics arising from strong frustration and prepared in an initial state which is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "highly frustrated or disordered baths were partially explored in [ ] where complete predictions for the decoherence could be made only for the case of a one dimensional ising bath or for spin shards in the infinite temperature limit . though these works illustrate the potential richness of interacting environments they also highlight the difficulty and limitations of using analytical methods to study these problems .",
    "we adopt a disordered spin bath described by the meanfield random ising model in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "this environment is characterized by a rich thermodynamic phase diagram which shows a spin - glass to paramagnetic transition as a function of temperature and external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the system is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bath hamiltonian and @xmath3 denotes the spin - bath interaction .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the spin of the qubit and the @xmath6-th spin of the bath respectively .",
    "the exchange energies @xmath7 are quenched random variables with a probability distribution @xmath8 , where the standard deviation of the distribution @xmath9 sets the unit of energy .",
    "the qubit couples to the bath operator @xmath10 , with @xmath11 representing either the @xmath12 or the @xmath13 component of the spins .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath14 are also taken to be quenched random variables .",
    "the physics of the bath is described by @xmath2 , the random transverse ising model ( rtim ) which is known to have the following phase diagram : at zero temperature , for transverse fields smaller than a critical field @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 , the system is in a spin glass phase @xcite . for @xmath17",
    "the system is magnetized with a gap in its spectrum . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the spin glass order survives up to a critical temperature @xmath18@xcite . a physical system which is expected to be reasonably described by the above model is @xmath19 , where the ho concentration , x , tunes the system between different physical regimes @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed as a minimal toy model to investigate the effects of quantum entanglement of spins @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath20 , that sets the value of the coefficient @xmath9 , is of the order of @xmath21 @xcite , in the compounds .",
    "consequently , the effective high temperature paramagnetic phases we study in this paper correspond to rather low real temperatures , where we expect the spin environment to dominate and phononic contributions to the decoherence can be neglected .",
    "there have also been propositions for engineering model magnetic environments with very small energy scales using cold atoms @xcite .",
    "we note that in the spin glass phase , only the correlations involving the @xmath13-component of the spin exhibit spin glass features whereas the correlation of the @xmath22 components merely exhibit a gap .",
    "clearly , it would be interesting to explore the effect of these phases on the decoherence of the qubit .",
    "moreover , due to the inherent anisotropy of the bath , we expect the decoherence to be dependent on whether the qubit couples to the @xmath13 or @xmath12 components of the bath spins . in this paper",
    ", we address these questions in the limit of weak qubit - spinbath coupling .",
    "since this problem can not be studied analytically , we use numerical exact diagonalization methods to calculate the bath eigenstates and eigenvalues and consequently , the resulting decoherence .",
    "we obtain a rich spectrum of results for the coherence of the qubit and in particular , a non - markovian i.e. , a non - exponential decay of the coherence at finite temperatures .",

    "in this section , we summarize the weak coupling formalism @xcite used to calculate the decoherence .",
    "this approach is valid provided the energy associated with the qubit - bath coupling is smaller than all the scales of the bath .",
    "we first assume that at time @xmath23 , the combined system of the central spin and the bath have a factorizable initial density matrix : @xmath24 . depending on the coupling of the central spin to the bath operator @xmath25 , the qubit is in a pure state whose basis vectors",

    "it is interesting to note that in the weak coupling limit , the decoherence is essentially dictated by @xmath53   which as can be seen from ( [ eq : sosigma ] ) is proportional to the symmetrized dynamic structure factor of the bath .    typically for spin baths , we encounter situations where",
    ", one can have a net magnetization along a certain spin direction @xmath54 , and/or magnetic ordering where @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 being constants independent of time , and @xmath58 a time - varying function .",
    "the resulting self energy in the laplacian variables then takes the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is some analytic function of @xmath12 . for the asymptotic decoherence ,",

    "morevoer , not all spectral densities @xmath53  obtained from interacting systems can be simulated by the usual non - interacting boson baths .    for the disordered systems studied here , the correlation functions ( [ eq : conncorr ] ) and ( [ eq : sosigma ] )",
    "need to be averaged over the probability distributions of both the exchange interactions @xmath7 and the coupling constants @xmath65 . in the rest of the paper , the coupling constants @xmath65 in",
    "are chosen to have the following disorder averages : @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total number of spins in the bath .",
    "this choice leads to the vanishing of the first order correction to the self energy since the disorder average of @xmath56 is zero .",
    "the disorder averaged @xmath48 , is then directly related to the connected local spin correlation functions @xmath69 , and it is evaluated using the spectral representation for the dynamical structure factor    @xmath70    where @xmath46 is the number of realizations of disorder for the exchange interactions @xmath7 and @xmath71 is the disordered average of the square of the local magnetic moment .",
    "our method for evaluating ( [ eq : spectral ] ) is presented below .",
    "to compute @xmath72 for the rtim spin - bath we use exact diagonalization methods .",
    "the advantage of the full diagonalization is that it permits us to calculate finite temperature quantities as well .",
    "we first study the coherence of the qubit coupled to a random ising chain bath described @xmath2 with the external field set to @xmath73 , where known analytical results can be used to benchmark the implemented numerical method .",
    "the interactions in the bath are confined to nearest neighbors on the chain and the spin - bath coupling is taken to be in the @xmath74 direction .",
    "we consider baths with the number of spins @xmath68 varying from 3 to 10 spins . for a given set of exchange interactions , the resulting hamiltonian which is a @xmath75 matrix is exactly diagonalized and",
    "the eigenenergies and functions are obtained .",

    "both temperature and size effects are seen to have an impact on the low frequency part of @xmath53  with the consequence that the asymptotic decoherence is more sensitive to thermal fluctuations and finite size effects .",
    "we use our numerical results for @xmath53  to calculate the decoherence @xmath39 given by .",
    "a comparison of our results with the analytical results obtained for the infinite chain @xcite permits us to gauge the importance of finite size effects . as for the infinite chain case of ref .",
    ", the decoherence for the finite chain can also be analyzed in terms of three regimes described by the two characteristic times : @xmath81 and @xmath82 . at short times , the coherence is given by the universal gaussian , @xmath83 , given by the sum rule of @xmath53@xmath84    the asymptotic markovian regime , where the coherence decays exponentially is characterized by the values of @xmath53  at @xmath79 ( for @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) . at high @xmath0 , @xmath39 remains practically constant up to @xmath87@xmath88 , where a final markovian regime arises .",

    "nonetheless , our results reproduce the existence of the different regimes .",
    "we would like to draw attention to the fact that the benchmark case of the chain is in a sense a worst case scenario .",
    "in fact , for a 1-d spin - bath one expects to have stronger finite size effects compared to the models to be studied in the rest of the paper : i.e. , infinite - range models which are known to have much reduced finite size effects @xcite .    before leaving this numerical method section",
    "we would like to note that our method differs substantially from others that are based on the solution of finite size clusters and cluster expansions .",
    "those methods usually deal with a non - disordered model hamiltonian , which is solved for a small system size .",
    "the finite size effects are dealt with by implementing various cluster expansion schemes . in those cases ,",
    "the finite nature of the cluster provides a discrete pole structure with a finite low energy cut - off and hence a finite recursion time that provides a long time cut - off for the study of the decoherence effects . in our case",
    "the situation is different .",
    "the effect of the bath enters through the spin susceptibility , and this quantity in a disordered model is computed through the disorder average . since we have a continuous ( gaussian ) distribution of couplings , the disorder - averaged susceptibility , though computed on finite size clusters , does not have a finite low - energy cut - off .",
    "therefore , the decoherence does not have a finite recursion time .",
    "all the systematic errors in our approach are due to the second order approximation , which is safe so long the coupling between the qubit and the bath is small , and to the finite size of the clusters that are diagonalized to compute the susceptibility of the bath s hamiltonian .",
    "this latter quantity can be , nevertheless , extrapolated to large system sizes , as we shall see latter .",
    "this is validated by the benchmark of the method against an analytically solvable case that we describe in the beginning of next section .",
    "in this section , we apply our numerical method to study the decoherence induced by interacting quantum spin - baths which do not have conventional magnetic order like ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism .",
    "the models studied all have infinite range interactions : i.e. , all spins interact with each other which leads to the presence of a significant geometric frustration .",
    "similar models have been studied in ref . , where the focus was on the nature of the distribution of the energy level spacings and their impact on the decoherence .",
    "a standard lore is that thermal fluctuations in the weak coupling regime always leads to a markovian i.e. , exponential decoherence . here",
    ", we will discuss cases , where the decoherence remains highly non - markovian in certain finite temperature paramagnets .",
    "we study the decoherence induced by the infinite - range random ising bath also known as the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite . for a gaussian distribution with zero mean of the exchange interactions between the spins , the system is paramagnetic except below the spin - glass transition temperature @xmath96 where the system develops spin glass order . note that for the infinite range model , extensiveness of the free energy requires as to scale the interactions @xmath97 . in this case",
    ", there is no first order contribution to the self energy and the second order contribution is given directly by the full correlation function as opposed to the connected correlation function of ( [ eq : conncorr ] ) i.e. , both @xmath98 .",
