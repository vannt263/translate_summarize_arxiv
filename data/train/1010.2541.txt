    "it is well known that there are digits specially used in watches , elevators , etc .",
    "these digits are of type :                                        a magic square is a collection of numbers put as a square matrix , where the sum of elements of each row , sum of elements of each column or sum of elements of each of two principal diagonals are the same . for simplicity ,",
    "let us write this sum as * s1*.            * * upside down * , i.e. , if we rotate it to @xmath5 degrees , it remains magic square again ; * * mirror looking * , i.e. , if we put it in front of mirror or see from the other side of the glass , or see on the other side of the paper , it always remains the magic square .",
    "if we use the seven digits 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 and 9 , then this gives us the conditions to produce a _ upside down bimagic square _ of order @xmath23 . in view of 6 and 9",
    ", we ca nt have it as mirror looking , because 6 as well as 9 do nt produce any number when we see them in mirror .",
    "this study we have presented separately in another work ( ref .",
    "taneja @xcite )    for more studies on magic and bimagic squares , we suggest to the readers the two sites @xcite , @xcite where one can find a good collection of work , papers , books , etc .",
    "the idea of _ universal bimagic square _ is presented for the first time here ."
