    "the merits of the two models in explaining the observed multiwavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the xdinss have been assessed in several studies , which are , however , hampered by the present poor knowledge of the star internal magnetic field structure and hence of the surface temperature distribution .",
    "mid - z element atmosphere models have been proposed for rx j1605.3 + 3249 @xcite . @xcite and @xcite used the condensed surface emission model to explain the observed properties of rx j0720.4 - 3125 and , respectively , although in the latter a thin , magnetized , h atmosphere on top of the condensate was added ( as originally suggested by * ? ? ?",

    "a detailed , comparative investigation of atmospheric / condensed surface emission models was presented by @xcite , who also accounted for the possible presence of a thin h atmosphere around the condensed surface .",

    "polarimetric measurements both at optical and x  ray energies can provide a valuable tool to better understand the physical properties of the neutron star surface .",
    "current 8-m class telescopes , e.g. the vlt , already allow to perform polarization measures for faint sources like the xdinss .",

    "they will open the possibility to perform x  ray polarimetry and pave the way toward the construction of a x  ray polarimeter efficient in the soft x  rays .",
    "radiation from the surface of a neutron star is expected to be intrinsically polarized , because the strong magnetic field introduces an anisotropy in the medium in which electromagnetic waves are propagating .",
    "this , in turn , causes the opacity of the two normal modes ( the ordinary and extraordinary ) to be different , so that the emergent radiation carries a net polarization ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the expected polarization pattern is different whether emission comes from an atmosphere @xcite or a condensed surface @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the polarized emission from xdinss can give us insight about the nature of the surface of strongly magnetized ns and ultimately probe the properties of the matter under strong magnetic fields .",
    "among the  magnificent seven \" , the most promising source for the study of polarized emission in the optical and x - ray band is ( hereafter rx j1856 ) .",
    "this is the brightest and nearest xdins , with @xmath18 , a nearly @xmath19 optical - uv sed @xcite and a x  ray spectrum well modeled by two blackbody components ( @xmath20  ev and @xmath21  ev denotes the temperature measured by an observer at infinity . ]",
    "the period derivative of rx j1856 has been obtained by @xcite , @xmath22 , which translates into a spin - down magnetic field of @xmath23  g. an alternative estimate , @xmath24  g ( at the magnetic pole , assuming a dipole model ) , has been derived from fitting continuum models to the observed optical and x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "these relatively strong magnetic fields imply that a non vanishing degree of polarization is indeed expected in the thermal emission of the source .",
    "in this paper we derive expectations for the polarization observables , focusing on the case of rx j1856 .",
    "first , we briefly summarize the theoretical brackground to calculate the thermal emission from a magnetized atmosphere and a condensed surface (   [ theory ] ) .",
    "then , we proceed to the calculation of the intrinsic polarization properties ( i.e. those at the star surface ) for a magnetized , fully - ionized h atmosphere and for a condensed surface (   [ results ] ) .",
    "we then turn to the evaluation of the polarization fraction and the polarizations angle as measured by a distant observer , accounting for the effects of qed ( vacuum polarization ) and of the non - uniform star magnetic field (   [ vac ] ) ; this is done following closely the approach described in ( * ? ? ?",

    "results are presented in   [ obspol ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in   [ disc ] .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the basic physical inputs of our model .",
    "since xdinss are slow rotators ( @xmath25 a few seconds , @xcite ) , we neglect the effects of rotation and assume that the space - time outside the star is described by the vacuum schwarzschild solution . moreover , despite our treatment can handle general axially - symmetric magnetic fields , in the following we restrict to the case in which the neutron star field is dipolar , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the polar field strength , @xmath28 is the star radius ( @xmath29 denotes the star mass ) and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the radial coordinate and the magnetic co - latitude , respectively .",

    "the spectral and polarization properties at infinity are computed by summing the contributions of the surface elements which are into view at a given rotational phase .",
    "following @xcite and paper i , we introduce the two angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 : the former is the angle between the line - of - sight ( los , unit vector @xmath39 ) and the spin axis ( @xmath40 ) , while the latter is that between the magnetic ( dipole ) axis ( @xmath41 ) , and the spin axis .",
    "we further introduce a ( fixed ) coordinate system , @xmath42 with the @xmath43-axis parallel to @xmath39 ( i.e. along the los ) and the @xmath44-axis in the @xmath45 plane , and a co - rotating coordinate system , @xmath46 , with the @xmath47-axis parallel to @xmath41 and the @xmath48-axis defined below .",

    "a @xmath75 mesh in @xmath76 and @xmath77 , equally spaced in the @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 $ ] intervals , respectively , is typically used in our numerical calculations .    in the case of radiation ( linearly ) polarized in the two normal modes ( the ordinary , o , and the extraordinary , x , mode ) , the total intensity is just the sum of the intensities in the two modes @xmath80 and we define the `` intrinsic '' degree of polarization , see",
    "also @xcite ) . ] , i.e. that at the source , as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the monochromatic , phase - dependent flux in each mode , defined as in equation ( [ flux ] ) .",
    "atmospheres around cooling nss are commonly modeled by considering a gas in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "since the scaleheight of the atmosphere , @xmath83  cm , is much smaller than the star radius , the radiative transfer equation is solved in the plane - parallel approximation , usually assuming an atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "atmospheric models have been presented by a number of authors , under different assumptions and accounting for different degrees of sophistication in the description of radiative processes and the plasma composition ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "our objective in this work is to derive simple expectations for the difference in the polarization signal emitted in the case the ns is covered by a gaseous layer or it is `` bare '' ( see   [ conden ] ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the assumption that of a fully ionized pure h atmosphere and avoid the complication of atmospheric compositions .",
    "the emergent intensity is computed using the numerical method presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the code exploits a complete linearization technique for solving the stationary radiative transfer equations for the two normal polarization modes in a plane - parallel slab , by including the effect of the magnetic field inclination with respect to the surface normal .",
    "the source term accounts for magnetic bremsstrahlung and magnetic thompson scattering .",
    "the spectral calculations have four input parameters : the ( local ) effective temperature @xmath84 and magnetic field strength , @xmath85 , the angle between the local magnetic field @xmath86 and the surface normal @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and the surface gravity , @xmath89 .",
    "the code solves for the emergent intensity @xmath90 for a range of photon energies @xmath91 , photon co - latitudes and azimuthal angles relative to the slab normal , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath94 direction is defined by the projection of the magnetic field on the symmetry planes .",
    "we should notice that , since the magnetic field introduces an anisotropy in the opacities , the emergent intensity is not symmetric with respect to a rotation around the surface normal but instead it depends on both , @xmath95 and @xmath93 . for the particular case in which @xmath96 , symmetry with respect to @xmath93 is restored ,",
    "so the calculation is restricted to the @xmath95-dependent intensities .",
    "moreover , even in the general case @xmath97 , thanks to the symmetry properties of the opacities , the calculation of the emergent spectrum can be restricted to @xmath98 .",
    "since we are considering photon energies well below the electron cyclotron frequency , the opacity for o - mode photons is almost unaffected by the magnetic field , while that for x - mode ones is substantially reduced @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , the emergent intensity of the x - mode is much larger than that of the o - mode , resulting in an emergent radiation with a non - null degree of polarization .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig:0pol ] , that shows the intrinsic polarization fraction , as a function of the energy , for a single model , assuming a parallel magnetic field ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "as it can be seen , for @xmath100  g , the polarization fraction is relatively high in the optical band ( @xmath101 ) and it tends to increase at high energies .",
    "magnetic fields higher than @xmath102 change the properties of atoms , confining electrons in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "these elongated , cylindrical atoms can form molecular chains by covalent bonding along the magnetic field lines . in turn",
    ", chain - chain interaction can lead to the formation of a condensed phase , as originally suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the cohesive energy for linear chains increases with the magnetic field strength and it is expected that , for sufficiently strong magnetic fields , there is a critical temperature , @xmath103 , below which a phase transition between a gaseous and a condensed state occurs .",
    "this critical temperature depends on composition and increases with magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "most recent estimates give @xmath104 $ ]  k for fe composition , meaning that a phase transition may occur for surface temperatures @xmath105  k if the field is stronger than @xmath106 .",
    "since these are the typical surface temperature and magnetic field found in xdinss , the thermal spectrum may indeed come from a condensed surface @xcite .         the spectral properties of emission from a neutron star with a condensed surface were investigated in several papers since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "in essence , the intensity is computed from the emissivity coefficient , @xmath107 , which is in turn related to the reflectivity via kirchhoff s law .",
    "the latter is calculated applying snell s law at the interface between the vacuum and the condensed phase .",
    "the boundary conditions for the transmission of an electromagnetic wave across the two media give the amplitude of the reflected waves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are uncertainties in this kind of calculation .",
    "our present knowledge of the condensate is poor , and the lacking of a reliable expression of the dielectric tensor hinders the correct derivation of the reflectivity .",
    "previous works adopted a simplified treatment , in which only the limits of `` free ions '' ( no account for the effects of the lattice on the interaction of the electromagnetic waves with ions ) and of `` fixed ions '' ( no ion response to the electromagnetic wave because lattice interactions are dominant ) were considered .",
    "the true reflectivity of the surface is expected to lie in between these two limits .    here",
    "we maintain the same approach and use the analytical approximations by @xcite to compute the emissivities in the two normal modes .",
    "they depend on the magnetic field @xmath85 , the photon direction @xmath36 and energy , and the angle between @xmath36 and @xmath86 , @xmath108 .",
    "however , the modes @xmath109 of @xcite are not defined with respect to the local direction of @xmath110 but with respect to the local normal @xmath111 , with mode 1 perpendicular to both @xmath112 and @xmath111 . as a consequence ,",
    "the emissivities @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) do not coincide with those in the x and o modes , unless @xmath111 and @xmath110 are parallel , i.e. @xmath115 . the transformation linking the emissivities in the two basis is given in appendix b of @xcite should be @xmath116 . ] .",

    "in the following we consider a ns with mass @xmath120 and radius @xmath121  km , which is compatible with expectations from modern equations of state such as apr or bsk21 models @xcite . the value of the radius is also in agreement with the estimates derived by @xcite and @xcite , assuming a source distance of 120 pc @xcite .",
    "this choice translates into a gravitational red - shift factor at the star surface @xmath122 .",
    "the rotational period of rx j1856 is @xmath123  s and the x  ray pulsed fraction is the lowest among the xdinss , @xmath124 @xcite . the polar strength of the dipole field is taken to be @xmath125  g , a value which is somehow intermediate between the spin - down measure and the estimates from spectral fitting @xcite .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is dipolar ( see  [ theory ] ) and that the surface temperature distribution is that induced by the core - centered dipole .",
    "since for fields higher than @xmath126 , electron conduction across the field lines is strongly suppressed , the meridional temperature variation is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the polar value of the temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we checked that this simple expression for @xmath129 differs only slightly ( @xmath130 ) from the more accurate formula by @xcite for @xmath131 .",
    "however , taken face value , the previous expression for @xmath132 yields vanishingly small values near the magnetic equator .",
    "the analysis of @xcite has shown that the x  ray spectrum of rx j1856 is best modeled in terms of two blackbody components with @xmath133  ev and @xmath134  ev . to account for this in a simple way",
    ", we actually adopt a temperature profile given by @xmath135 with @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "we first consider the case in which the star is surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere .",
    "the star surface is divided in six angular patches in magnetic colatitude , centered at the values @xmath138 . by using the magnetic and temperature profiles",
    "previously described we compute , for each @xmath31 , the local magnetic field strength , @xmath85 , the angle @xmath88 between the magnetic field and the normal to the surface , and hence the temperature , @xmath84 .",
    "we then compute a set of atmospheric models corresponding to the six @xmath31 angles . since the models are computed using different integration grids in the photon phase space ( because the choice of the photon trajectories along which the radiative transfer is solved needs to be optimized to ensure fast convergence at the different values of magnetic field strength and inclination , see",
    "* ) , we reinterpolate all model outputs over a common grid .",
    "this results in three 4-d arrays for the emergent intensity @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) which contain the total intensity and the intensities for the ordinary and extraordinary modes , respectively . in order to take into account the emission from the southern magnetic hemisphere of the star",
    ", we use the previous 4-d arrays with the substitutions @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which is justified by the simmetry properties of the opacities . by using the ray tracing method described in   2 , we can then compute lightcurves , phase resolved spectra and polarization fractions for each choice of the angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "as an example , figure [ fig:0lc ] shows the x  ray lightcurve ( @xmath143 kev ) and the phase  dependent polarization degree in the x  ray and optical  ev at infinity . ]",
    "( b  filter ) bands , for @xmath144 and @xmath145 . for this particular viewing geometry , the x ",
    "ray pulsed fraction is @xmath146 , in agreement with the observed data and , as illustrated in the figure , the polarization degree is expected to be substantial and constant in phase .",
    "figure [ fig:0cntat ] shows the contour plots of the phase - averaged polarization fraction in the ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) plane , for the x  ray ( @xmath143 kev ) and optical ( b - filter ) bands . in both cases",
    "the phase - averaged polarization degree is significantly high . like the results already obtained for the viewing geometry used in figure [ fig:0lc ] , the phase - averaged polarization degree in the x  ray band is @xmath147 , and that in the optical band is only slightly lower , @xmath148 .",
    "it is important to stress that these plots ( and the analogous ones in  [ rescon ] ) show the polarization degree as computed by using the definition given in equation  ( [ polint ] ) , i.e. considering the difference in the radiative flux carried by the two modes when radiation reaches infinity , and repeating the calculation at different spin phases .",
    "although we take into account for relativistic ray bending ( i.e. for the fact that the emitting area which is into view is larger than a hemisphere ) , a proper calculation of the polarization observables is based on the stokes parameters and must account for both qed effects in the magnetized vacuum through which photons propagate and the rotation of the plane normal to the photon wavevector in a varying magnetic field ( see  [ vac ] ) , effects that are not accounted for in the plots of figure [ fig:0cntat ] .",
    "we therefore refer to this quantity as the `` intrinsic '' degree of linear polarization , to distinguish it from the observed one , which is discussed later on ( see section 4 ) .",
    "we remark that both the `` intrinsic '' and the observed degree of polarization are evaluated at infinity , and a comparison of the two quantities may be of help in understanding how qed and geometrical effects influence the polarization observables .",
    "the same approach described in the previous subsection was used to compute the ( phase - dependent ) spectrum and the intrinsic polarization fraction for a bare inss with a condensed surface . in this case",
    "the calculation was repeated twice , by assuming either `` free '' or `` fixed '' ions .",
    "since we adopt the approximated analytical expressions by @xcite for the emissivities , no interpolations were required , contrary to the case of the atmosphere .",
    "the fitting formulae , however , cover the range @xmath149 . in order to take into account the emission from the southern magnetic hemisphere of the star , where @xmath86 `` enters '' into the surface and @xmath150 , the emissivities are calculated by replacing @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 with @xmath154 ( a. potekhin , private communication ) .",
    "results are reported in figure [ fig:0lccon ] , where the x  ray lightcurve and the phase dependent polarization degree are shown for @xmath144 and @xmath155 , which is again compatible with a pulsed fraction of @xmath156 .",
    "are not too different from those obtained using an atmospheric model . ]",
    "the corresponding contour plots for the x  ray and optical phase - averaged polarization fraction are shown in figure [ fig:0cntconfr ] ( free ions ) and figure [ fig:0cntconfx ] ( fixed ions ) , respectively . in the case of free ions , the phase - averaged polarization degree in the x ",
    "ray band is always less than @xmath157 either when the emission is dominated by ordinary ( negative values ) or extraordinary photons ( positive values , see figure [ fig:0cntconfr ] , right panel ) , while in the optical band ( figure [ fig:0cntconfr ] , left panel ) ordinary photons are predominant , with a maximum polarization degree @xmath158 for particular viewing geometries . in the case of fixed ions expectations are similar in the x  ray band , where the phase - averaged polarization degree is always less than @xmath159 .",
    "however , in the optical band , the polarization degree can be slightly larger , up to @xmath160 ( figure [ fig:0cntconfx ] , left panel ) , for the most favorable viewing geometries .",
    "a strong magnetic field can modify the properties of the vacuum outside the ns .",
    "in particular , due to qed effects , photons can temporarily convert into electron - positron pairs , and those virtual pairs modify the dielectric and the magnetic permeability tensors of the vacuum .",
    "this affects the direction of the photon electric field and , in turn , influences the polarization fraction as observed at infinity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) . as a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave propagates in the magnetized vacuum close to the star , the direction of the electric field changes on a spatial scale much shorter than that over which @xmath86 varies .",

    "the evolution of the wave electric field can be followed by solving the ( linearized ) wave equation in the magnetized vacuum around the star along each photon trajectory . however , as shown in paper i , the main effects of vacuum polarization can be cought using a simpler approach in which adiabatic propagation ( i.e. mode locking ) is assumed up to @xmath162 , while the electric field direction is constant ( and modes change ) for @xmath164 . in this approach",
    "the polarization properties are determined by the direction of the magnetic field at @xmath162 , in addition to the intrinsic polarization degree at the surface .                    since the x and o modes are defined according to the direction of the wave electric field with respect to the plane spanned by the magnetic field @xmath86 and",

    "while the @xmath165 axes coincide with the los ( i.e. with @xmath166 ) , the two axes , @xmath167 , in the plane orthogonal to @xmath166 will be different for each photon trajectory , because @xmath86 changes its direction over the sphere of radius @xmath162 . in order to derive the polarization observables , as detected by a distant instrument , the stokes parameters",
    "must be referred to the same fixed direction in the plane perpendicular to the los , @xmath168 .",
    "this is done by rotating the stokes parameters by an angle @xmath169 ( for the choice of the sign of @xmath170 see , paper i ) @xmath171    in a strong magnetic field , each photon is 100@xmath172 polarized either in the x - mode or o - mode .",
    "this is conveniently expressed in terms of the ( normalized ) stokes parameters of each photon as @xmath173 , @xmath174 ( for x - mode and o - mode photons ) and @xmath175 ( see paper i ) .",
    "the collective stokes parameters , i.e. those for the entire radiation field , are simply the sum of the individual parameters .",
    "this is immediately generalized to a continuum photon distribution following the same approach as in equation ( [ flux ] ) @xmath176 where @xmath177 , and @xmath178 are the fluxes of the stokes parameters ; here @xmath179 is proportional to the total number flux and in ( [ stokesflux ] ) the constant factor appearing in front of the integral ( see equation [ [ flux ] ] ) has been dropped . the explicit expression for @xmath180 as a function of @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 , the phase @xmath183 and the photon energy , @xmath184 was derived in paper i. finally , the observed polarization fraction and polarization angle are given by the usual expressions @xmath185",

    "in particular , we compute and compare the x  ray pulsed fraction , the phase - averaged degree of polarization and polarization angle in the x  ray and in the optical bands as functions of the two geometrical angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here",

    "we should notice that the choice of the direction of the polarimeter reference frame with respect to the `` fixed '' reference frame of the neutron star has no effect on the polarization fraction , but it affects the polarization angle ( see   [ vac ] and paper i for details ) .",
    "the computed x  ray pulsed fractions are quite similar for both the atmosphere ( figure [ fig : cntatm ] , left panel ) and condensed surface ( figure [ fig : cntcfree ] and [ fig : cntcfix ] , left panels ) .",
    "particularly , the @xmath146 x  ray pulsed fraction observed in rx j1856 does not impose a strong constraint on the viewing geometry for one angle and @xmath186 for the other .",
    "our ranges for the viewing angles are compatible but less restrictive .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to the different choice of mass , radius and temperature which are @xmath187 , @xmath188  km ( note that the value of the radius was based on a different distance estimate ) and @xmath189  k ( at the magnetic pole ) and @xmath190  k ( at the magnetic equator ) in @xcite .",
    "] of the ns ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 angles )",
    ". however , it imposes ( to a minor extent ) a constraint to the polarization observables .",
    "so , for comparison and completeness we also keep this information in the contour plots of phase - averaged polarization fraction and polarization angle .    figure [ fig : cntatm ] shows our results for the case of magnetized atmospheric model .",
    "first , we note that the range of viewing angles in which the polarization fraction is substantial ( and potentially detectable ) is approximately given by @xmath191 .",
    "viewing geometries near @xmath144 , @xmath192 or @xmath144 , @xmath193 , which correspond to aligned and orthogonal rotators respectively , both seen perpendicularly to the spin axis , are particularly favorable for observing a high phase - averaged polarization fraction",
    ". in particular , for @xmath144 and @xmath192 the phase - averaged polarization fraction can reach @xmath194 in the optical band , and be even larger , up to @xmath195 , in the x  ray band .",
    "figure [ fig : cntcfree ] and [ fig : cntcfix ] show the case of a condensed surface in the two limits , free and fixed ions , respectively .",
    "the results are noticeably different with respect to the atmospheric model . in fact , for free ions , if we consider for example viewing geometries close to @xmath196 and @xmath192 the phase - averaged polarization fraction can still be as large as @xmath197 in the optical band but it is substantially reduced in the x  ray band . in the case of fixed ions , for similar viewing geometries , we expect a phase - averaged polarization fraction of @xmath198 in the optical band while , in the x  ray band , the polarization is vanishingly small for all viewing angles .",
    "as noticed in @xcite and in paper i , the phase - averaged polarization fraction is expected to be small for @xmath199 , due to a combination of both qed effects and the frame rotation of the stokes parameters which is needed in presence of a varying magnetic field over the emitting region . in paper",
    "i , the emission from a ns is computed for a dipolar magnetic field distribution and @xmath200 polarized blackbody emission , and it is found that in almost the entire region @xmath199 the phase - averaged polarization fraction is roughly zero , consistently with the present results .",
    "the effects of the choice of the emission model become important for viewing angles @xmath191 . in particular , for a magnetized atmosphere , the highest phase - averaged polarization fraction is attained in the region near @xmath144 and @xmath192 .",
    "this is because : i ) under this hypothesis an `` intrinsic '' polarization fraction ( see   [ resatmo ] ) as high as @xmath201 is expected , and ii ) in the case of an aligned rotator there is virtually no differential effect due to the rotation of the stokes parameters at the adiabatic radius ( that tends to reduce the observed polarization degree ) .",
    "the situation is different for the condensed surface emission . in the optical band , in fact",
    ", we expect a maximum of the `` intrinsic '' polarization fraction as high as @xmath158 ( @xmath160 ) for the case of free ( fixed ) ions at viewing angles @xmath202 ( see   [ rescon ] ) . however , for this viewing geometry , the depolarizing effects of the stokes parameter rotation are stronger because the @xmath180 angle distribution assumes symmetrically all the values in the range @xmath79 $ ] , cancelling the original `` intrinsic '' polarization at infinity . as shown in figures [ fig : cntcfree ] and [ fig : cntcfix ] , central panels , a significant polarization degree , as high as @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) for the case of free ( fixed ) ions , is present only for sligthly greater values of @xmath38 , before decreasing again according to the behaviors shown in the plots of figures [ fig:0cntconfr ] and [ fig:0cntconfx ] ( left panels ) . on the other hand , in the x  ray band ,",
    "ordinary and extraordinary waves are expected to have similar reflected amplitudes : the `` intrinsic '' polarization fraction is therefore substantially reduced and as well the observed ones ( at all viewing angles ) .    figure [ fig : atmang ] shows the phase - averaged polarization angle for the atmospheric emission in the optical and x  ray bands .",
    "the computed quantity is nearly constant in two regions of viewing angles , for which it is @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "this occurs also for the condensed surface models ( see figure [ fig : cfixang ] in the case of fixed ions ) ; however , the main difference is that in these cases the expectation are somehow reversed in the two bands .",
    "in fact , by considering the region of viewing angles in which the phase - averaged polarization fraction is detectable , @xmath205 and @xmath206 , we can see that in the case of fixed ions the expected phase - averaged polarization angle in the optical is @xmath207 , while the x  ray band this is @xmath208 .",
    "again , this behavior can be understood in terms of qed effects .",
    "the polarization angle reflects the global direction of the electric field distribution of the radiation , which in turn depends on the direction of the magnetic field at the adiabatic radius .",
    "then , the observed phase - averaged polarization angle should reflect the `` phase - averaged '' direction of the magnetic field at the adiabatic radius , which for viewing angles @xmath191 is approximately parallel and for @xmath199 is approximately perpendicular to the spin axis .",
    "as a consequence , if the observed radiation is dominated by extraordinary photons , then for @xmath191 the `` average '' observed direction of the photon electric field is perpendicular to the spin axis , and the phase - averaged polarization angle is @xmath209 , in agreement with our expectations for the case of the atmosphere model in both , the optical and the x  ray band ( figure [ fig : atmang ] , left and right panel , respectively ) . here",
    ", we should notice that the association between the normal modes and the phase - averaged polarization fraction is possible because we already set the coordinate system of the polarimeter aligned with the `` fixed '' coordinate system of the ns .",
    "however , in general the reference frames of the polarimeter and the `` fixed '' one of the ns are expected to be disaligned .            for condensed surface emission ( in both approximations , fixed and free ions ) , whereas in the optical band the emitted radiation is dominated by ordinary photons ( see figure [ fig:0cntconfx ] , left panel ) , in the x  ray band the two modes have similar intensities , with the emitted radiation being slightly dominated by extraordinary photons for fixed ions ( figure [ fig:0cntconfx ] , right panel ) . as a consequence , in the optical band and for viewing angles",
    "@xmath191 we expect that the phase - averaged direction of the photon electric field is parallel to the spin axis , and thus the phase - averaged polarization angle is @xmath204 . on the contrary , in the x  ray band and again for viewing angles @xmath191 the phase - averaged direction of the photon electric field is perpendicular to the spin axis , and therefore the expected phase - averaged polarization angle is @xmath209 .",
    "however , the behavior of the polarization angle in the x  rays is quite irregular , due to the fact that the emissivities of the two modes in this band are similar to each other .",
    "so , the polarization angle present jumps by 90@xmath210 , which arise because of an even slight predominance of o over x photons or conversely . for the same reason",
    ", we do not show the contour plots in the case of free ions , since the corresponding polarization fraction in the two energy bands is even lower than that of the fixed - ions case ; hence , the phase - averaged polarization angle behavior for free ions present even more noisy patterns .",
    "the main conclusion is that , by measuring the phase - averaged polarization observables in optical _ and _ x  ray bands it is potentially possible to discriminate between atmospheric and crustal emission .",
    "the most favorable geometries are those with viewing angles @xmath191 , for which the expected phase - averaged polarization fraction is substantial .",
    "if emission is atmospheric , we expect a high phase - averaged polarization fraction in both , optical and x  ray band ( although slightly lower in the optical ) .",
    "whereas , if emission originates from a condensed surface , the phase - averaged polarization fraction should be modest in the optical , with an almost unpolarized signal in the x  ray band .    at the same time , the phase - averaged polarization angle for atmospheric emission is expected to be the same in the optical and x  ray band . on the contrary , for crustal emission the angle measured in the two bands",
    "is expected to be different by @xmath209 ( although this latter consideration is just a theoretical expectation , since realistically the measure of the angle in the x  ray band can not be performed due to low degree of polarization in the signal ) .",
    "we studied the polarization properties of the thermal emission from rx j1856 considering different emission models : a ns with a magnetized atmosphere or a condensed surface .",
    "the effects of vacuum polarization in the propagation of the radiation in the ns magnetosphere and the rotation of the stokes parameters were accounted for . using a ray tracing method and assuming a dipole magnetic field , we derived the polarization observables for different viewing angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we found that the phase - averaged polarization fraction can be substantially large for viewing angles @xmath211 , which is consistent with previous works ( see paper i and references therein ) .",
    "for these viewing angles , in the case of an atmosphere , we found that a ) the phase - averaged polarization fraction in the optical band is expected to be lower than in the x  ray band and b ) the phase - averaged polarization angle in the optical is the same that in the x  ray band . in the case of condensed surface",
    ", we found that a ) the phase - averaged polarization fraction in the optical band is substantially higher than in the x  ray band and b ) the phase - averaged polarization angle in the optical band is generally shifted by 90@xmath210 with respect to that in the x  ray band .",
    "therefore , by combining optical and x  ray observations of the polarized emission from rx j1856 , it is possible to determine if this xdins has an atmosphere or a condensed surface .",
    "our treatment of the surface emission from rx j1856 relied on a number of assumptions / simplifications which are discussed in more detail below . in this respect",
    "we stress that our main goal has been to assess to which extent polarization measurements at optical and x  ray energies are effective in discriminating among different emission models , rather than to derive theoretical predictions to be matched with current observations ( e.g. through spectral fitting ) .",
    "it is in this spirit that we deliberately chose to restrict to a simple treatment of the emission models we employed , in particular for the atmospheric model .",
    "a major simplification we introduced is that of pure h composition and complete ionization . for the low surface temperature ( @xmath212 ev ) and strong magnetic field ( @xmath213 g ) of rx j1856",
    ", the neutral fraction of h atoms is expected to be @xmath214@xmath215 for typical atmospheric densities @xcite , so that opacities are affected .",
    "h atmospheres with partial ionization have been presented e.g. by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the major difference with respect to fully ionized models is the appearance of spectral features related to atomic transitions .",
    "these features , however , are mainly confined to far uv  soft x  ray range ( @xmath216 kev ) , and fully ionized models give a reasonable description of the spectra at x  ray / optical energies . moreover , the features are strongly smeared out when the contributions from different surface patches ( each with a different @xmath84 and @xmath86 ) are summed together to obtain the spectrum at infinity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see again also @xcite ) , similarly to what occurs to the proton cyclotron line @xcite .    as noticed by (",
    "* see also @xcite ) , in the atmosphere around a strongly magnetized neutron star vacuum polarization can induce a mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein like resonance across which a photon may convert from one mode into the other , with significant changes in the opacities and polarization .",
    "while for @xmath217  g this is not going to change the emission spectrum , it still can significantly affect the polarization pattern at least at certain energies .",
    "for a photon of energy @xmath184 , the vacuum resonance occurs when the vacuum and plasma contributions to the dielectric tensor become comparable , i.e. where @xmath218 g @xmath219 , where @xmath220 ( @xmath43 and @xmath221 are the atomic and mass number of the ions ) and @xmath222 is a slowly varying function of @xmath85 . near the vacuum resonance , the probability of mode conversion",
    "is given by @xmath223 $ ] , where @xmath224 depends on the photon energy , on @xmath85 and on the angle between the photon direction and @xmath86 ( @xmath108 , * ? ? ?",
    "* see in particular their eq .",
    "3 ) . for @xmath225  g",
    "( as in the case discussed in this work ) , it is @xmath226  g/@xmath219 , i.e. the vacuum resonance is well outside the photospheres of both the ordinary and the extraordinary mode .",
    "moreover , the inequality @xmath227 is satisfied for all photon energies @xmath228 kev , unless radiation is propagating nearly along the magnetic field direction ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "for this reason our assumption of `` no mode conversion '' at the vacuum resonance , which is equivalent to assume @xmath230 ( or @xmath231 ) for all photons , appears reasonable .",
    "further narrow features due to mode collapse and spin - flip transitions are expected very near the broad proton cyclotron resonance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite for the case of electrons ) . in the absence to a complete description of the dielectric tensor in a electrons+ions+vacuum plasma we assumed as a working hypothesis no mode conversion at this frequency .",
    "the present analysis can be extended to other xdinss as well .",
    "the narrow range of surface temperatures inferred from the spectra of xdinss , @xmath232  ev may be important to determine the state of the surface , but it should not have an important effect on the properties of the observable polarization . a significant difference on the polarization properties of xdinss",
    "may be introduced if we consider different magnetic field configurations ( see paper i for the example of a twisted magnetic field ) . however ,",
    "in general , xdinss share similar magnetic field configuration , i.e. , external dipole magnetic field , and there is no observational evidence for multipolar components or twisted magnetic fields ( such as those that may be present in magnetars , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by the good agreement between the magnetic fields derived from timing properties and those inferred from the absorption lines ( assuming that they are caused by proton cyclotron resonance , see @xcite ) , and the absence of non - thermal emission that may be linked to the presence of a twist in the external magnetic field . however , in this respect rx j0720.4 - 3125 may be an exception . for this xdins , an absorption feature that is energy - dependent and",
    "phase - dependent has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "if this feature is caused by proton cyclotron resonance , then it would be compatible with the presence of a multipolar component confined very close to the ns surface and consistent with a magnetic field @xmath233  g. the effect of this component on the polarization properties of the radiation has not been assessed , but certainly it can be studied using the method developed in paper i and the emission models here discussed .",
