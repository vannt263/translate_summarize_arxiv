    "the strong cosmic evolution of the most powerful radio galaxies was deduced more than forty years ago from radio source counts ( longair 1966 ) , which imply that the space density of powerful radio galaxies at redshift @xmath11 was roughly a thousand times higher than in the local universe ( doroshkevich , longair & zeldovich 1970 , dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",
    "far less is known about the cosmic evolution of the lower  power radio galaxies which comprise the overwhelming majority of the local radio agn population .",
    "relatively few low  power radio galaxies have been observed at redshifts beyond @xmath12 , partly because classical flux ",
    "limited radio surveys like the cambridge 3cr ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) and molonglo mrc ( large et al .  1981 ) sample only a narrow range in radio luminosity at any given redshift ( see e.g.  blundell et al .",
    "2002 ) ; but the observed distribution of radio source counts implies that low ",
    "power radio sources can not evolve as rapidly as the most powerful sources do ( longair 1966 ) .",
    "this finding led to the development of two classes of model for the cosmic evolution of radio  loud active galaxies : single - population models , in which the rate of evolution varies with radio power ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ) , and dual  population models , in which the radio  source population is assumed to be made up of a low  luminosity non  evolving component and a high  luminosity rapidly  evolving component ( jackson & wall 1999 ) . in the dual  population models , the two populations have been variously been identified with fri and frii radio galaxies ( wall 1980 ; later expanded by jackson & wall 1999 to include bl lac objects and flat  spectrum qsos as the beamed counterparts of fri and frii objects respectively ) ; or with objects having weak and strong optical emission lines , independent of their radio morphology ( willott et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "several recent studies imply that low  power radio galaxies ( i.e.  those with 1.4ghz radio luminosities near or below the fri / frii divide at @xmath13whz@xmath3 ) undergo little or no cosmic evolution . in the model of jackson & wall ( 1999 ) , which is consistent with both radio source counts and the observed redshift distribution of 3cr sources ,",
    "there is strong cosmic evolution of frii radio galaxies but no evolution of the fri population .",
    "clewley & jarvis ( 2004 ) also found no increase in the comoving density of radio sources with luminosities below p@xmath14whz@xmath3 over the redshift range @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , brown , webster & boyle ( 2001 ) found significant luminosity evolution ( of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ) for a sample of low  power radio galaxies over the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "snellen & best ( 2001 ) found two distant fri radio galaxies in the small area of sky covered by the hubble deep field ; from which they argue that fri radio galaxies must be significantly more abundant at @xmath19 than in the nearby universe .",
    "willott et al .  ( 2001 ) also suggest that the comoving space density of low ",
    "luminosity radio galaxies rises by about 1 dex between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the tight relation between the mass of luminous early  type galaxies and the mass of their central supermassive black holes ( magorrian et al .  1998 ) implies that the evolution of galaxies and their central black holes are intimately related .",
    "there is also increasing evidence that radio jets can regulate and prevent star formation in luminous early  type galaxies by heating the interstellar gas and stopping the onset of cooling flows ( binney & tabor 1995 ; rawlings & jarvis 2004 ; birzan et al .",
    "2004 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "since most radio galaxies have radio luminosities well below the fri / frii break for most of their lifetimes , improving our understanding of the cosmic evolution of these lower  power radio galaxies is an essential first step in understanding their effects on the star  formation history of massive galaxies .",
    "this is particularly important in the context of recent semi  analytic models of galaxy evolution which incorporate agn heating ( e.g. croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al . 2006 ) , as we discuss in  6.4 of this paper .",
    "previous studies in this area have relied strongly on the analysis of radio source ",
    "counts and/or on the use of photometric redshifts to derive distances . however , the most direct and accurate way to measure the cosmic evolution of low  power radio galaxies is to compare the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) observed at different redshifts .",
    "this requires a large volume  limited ( rather than flux ",
    "limited ) sample of radio sources which is reasonably complete over a wide range in radio power .",
    "such samples can now be assembled by combining a large optical redshift survey with a sensitive , large  area radio continuum survey ; this technique has been used to measure accurate rlfs for galaxies in the local universe ( sadler et al .",

    " excitation emission lines of [ nev ] 3426  and [ neiii ] 3870   are also detected in a few 2slaq lrgs ( like j092203.20@xmath44004443.5 in figure [ fig.spectra ] ) , as discussed later in  4.3 .",
    "the great majority ( @xmath45 ) of radio  detected 2slaq lrgs show absorption  line spectra like the galaxy in figure [ fig.spectra](a ) , and only a handful have an e@xmath46a spectrum like that shown in [ fig.spectra](d ) .",
    "we adopted a two  step approach similar to that described by best et al .",
    "( 2005a ) to identify radio sources associated with the 2slaq lrgs , using radio  source catalogues from both the vla first survey ( becker et al .  1995 ) and the nvss ( condon et al .  1998 )    the first and nvss radio surveys have complementary properties .",
    "nvss , with a 45arcsec beam , accurately samples the total flux density of extended radio sources .",
    "first , with a 5arcsec beam , has higher spatial resolution but at the expense of resolving out extended radio emission on scales larger than a few arcseconds ( and hence underestimating the total flux density of galaxies with extended radio components ) .",
    "we therefore use the first positions to identify 2slaq radio galaxies and the nvss flux densities to calculate the radio luminosity function .      the surface density of bright galaxies ( b@xmath2719.5mag . )",
    "is low enough that reliable radio identifications can usually be made from the nvss survey alone ( see e.g. sadler et al .",
    "2002 , mauch & sadler 2006 ) . for fainter objects ,",
    "however , more accurate radio positions are needed .",
    "best et al .  (",
    "2005a ) have developed a multi - stage method using information from both first and nvss to produce a sample of radio  source ids with high completeness and reliability , and have used this to identify the radio counterparts of galaxies ( @xmath47mag . ) in the second data release of the sdss .",
    "experience shows that the measured radio luminosity function of volume  limited galaxy samples such as the sdss and 2dfgrs is very robust against small changes in the way the sample is selected .",
    "for example , the rlfs measured by best et al .",
    "( 2005a ) for local agn and star  forming galaxies agree well with those measured by sadler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and mauch & sadler ( 2006 ) even though slightly different radio identification criteria were used in all three investigations .",
    "in this study we use a similar approach to that of best et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , though with some modifications as described below . in particular , we check all our candidate first radio ids visually on radio  optical overlay plots .",
    "this matches the procedure used by mauch & sadler ( 2006 ) to identify a large sample of radio galaxies from the 6df galaxy survey ( jones et al .",
    "2004 ) , which we use here as the local benchmark to measure the redshift evolution of the radio luminosity function .",
    "we carried out the radio  source identification in three stages :    * early in the project , we performed a series of tests on the 2003 version of the 2slaq lrg input photometric catalogue .",
    "this allowed us to estimate both the reliability of the final radio sample and the expected number of extended double and multiple radio sources , as described in  3.2.1 .",
    "* once the 2slaq spectroscopic observations were complete , we cross - matched the final spectroscopic catalogue with the first survey .",
    "this allowed us to identify a sample of 367 2slaq lrgs associated with first radio sources ( see  3.3.1 ) .",
    "* we also cross - matched the 2slaq lrg spectroscopic catalogue with the nvss catalogue as discussed in  3.3.2 .",
    "this allowed us to identify six very extended radio sources with angular sizes greater than 1arcmin , as well as 22 weak radio sources which were not listed \u0000in the first catalogue .",
    "the nvss catalogue provides accurate total flux densities for most of the sources identified in the first catalogue .        of the 70,582 galaxies listed in the 2003 2slaq lrg input",
    "photometric catalogue , 60,290 ( 85% ) lay within the region of sky covered by the first radio catalogue .",
    "we checked for possible matches of these galaxies with first radio sources , using a 30arcsec maximum offset between the radio and optical positions ( because both our own tests and the study by best et al .",
    "( 2005a ) showed that only a handful of genuine radio ids are expected at larger separations ) .",
    "for the redshift range covered by the 2slaq lrgs ( @xmath22 ) , 30arcsec corresponds to a projected linear distance from the optical galaxy of 160220kpc .",
    "the few radio galaxies with radio lobes more distant than this are best identified in the lower - resolution nvss images as discussed below .",
    "a total of 2,782 of the lrgs in the input catalogue ( 4% ) had one or more first radio sources within 30arcsec of the optical position , and so were candidate radio galaxies .",
    "we repeated the matching process using a set of ` random ' positions offset by 10arcmin from the position of each galaxy in the 2slaq input catalogue .",
    "this monte carlo test allows estimation of the number of unrelated foreground or background radio sources which are seen by chance .",
    "figure [ fig.offset ] plots the number of sources seen in 2slaq and random fields as a function of the offset between radio and optical positions .",
    "note that the vertical axis is logarithmic , so the excess of sources at separations @xmath48arcsec is very large .",
    "as expected , the number of matched sources approaches the value expected by chance for offsets larger than about 20arcsec .",
    "the population of first radio sources within 30arcsec of a 2slaq lrg will be a mixture of the following : + ( a ) single radio sources which are genuinely associated with a 2slaq galaxy .",
    "+ ( b ) components of double or triple radio sources which are genuinely associated with a 2slaq galaxy .",
    "+ ( c ) unrelated foreground or background radio sources .",
    "the likely numbers of such objects can be estimated from monte carlo tests .",
    "+ ( d ) components of single , double or triple radio sources associated with neighbouring galaxies at the same redshift as the 2slaq galaxy .    for each 2slaq lrg with a candidate radio source within 30arcsec , we overlaid radio contours from the first survey onto greyscale optical images ( taken mainly from the sdss dr3 , with a small number from the supercosmos images ) .",
    "these overlays were then inspected by at least two team members , who flagged each candidate source as ` accept ' or ` reject ' based on the following guidelines : + ( i ) all sources less than 3.0arcsec from a 2slaq galaxy were accepted as genuine ids .",
    "+ ( ii ) a single first source separated by 310arcsec from a 2slaq galaxy is accepted as an i d if ( a ) it is spatially resolved and extended in the direction of the optical galaxy , ( b ) the separation is no larger than the projected major axis of the radio source , and ( c ) no other optical object closer to the radio position is visible on the overlay images .",
    "+ ( iii ) two first components of similar flux density are accepted as ids if the optical galaxy lies within 5.0arcsec of the radio centroid ( unless another optical object is closer ) .",
    "+ ( iv ) where three or more first components are present , a decision on whether each is associated with the optical galaxy is based on visual inspection alone .      of the 2,871 first matches with the 2slaq input photometric catalogue , 1602 ( 56% ) were classified as genuine associations with 1362 2slaq galaxies .",
    "this corresponds to a radio detection rate of 2.3% for the 2003 2slaq input catalogue . of the accepted radio galaxies ,",
    "87% had a single first component , 10% were doubles and 3% were resolved into three or more first components .",
    "our monte carlo tests imply that the excess of ` real ' over ` random ' sources in this sample should be roughly 1750@xmath4940 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the 1602 sources we accepted as genuine associations with 2slaq galaxies , and at first glance might suggest that we have failed to recognize up to 150 genuine matches of first radio sources with galaxies in the 2slaq input catalogue .",
    "however , as noted by best et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , monte carlo tests will not give a reliable estimate of completeness if the 2slaq galaxies are strongly clustered .",
    "if the overall space density of galaxies is higher in the vicinity of a 2slaq lrg , then the probability of finding a radio source within 30arcsec of the lrg will also be higher .",
    "for the 2003 2slaq input catalogue , we have a statistical excess of 148@xmath4940 radio sources which are not identified with 2slaq galaxies but also can not be explained by chance associations of foreground or background objects .",
    "if these excess radio sources are associated with lrgs which are clustered near 2slaq galaxies but fall below the @xmath50magnitude cutoff of the 2slaq catalogue , and if we assume the same 2.3% radio detection rate for these slightly fainter lrgs as for the 2slaq galaxies , we would require an excess of about 6500 lrgs within 30arcsec of a 2slaq lrg .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath5111% of 2slaq lrgs have another lrg within 30arcsec on the sky ( a projected separation of 190kpc for redshift @xmath5=0.55 ) , which is consistent with the observed level of clustering in the 2slaq lrg sample ( ross et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the 2slaq lrg input catalogue was revised and expanded in 2004 , so the final lrg spectroscopic sample is not a simple subset of the 2003 input catalogue discussed above .",
    "we therefore repeated the matching process described in  3.2.1 for the 14,978 galaxies in the final spectroscopic lrg sample .",
    "the overlap with the first survey area was significantly higher for the final spectroscopic catalogue ( 96.5% ) than for the 2003 input catalogue ( 85% ) , giving us near  complete radio data for the spectroscopic sample is significantly lower in the final spectroscopic catalogue than in the 2003 input catalogue . since the first survey has incomplete coverage of regions within 20 degrees of the galactic plane , its overlap with the final spectroscopic catalogue is correspondingly higher than the 85% overlap with the 2003 input photometric catalogue . ] .",
    "the lower  resolution nvss is more sensitive to large  scale radio emission than the first survey , and so provides a better measure of the total flux density of extended radio sources ( condon et al .",
    "we independently cross - matched the 2slaq spectroscopic catalogue with the nvss , both to measure more accurate total flux densities for sources identified through matching with first and also to search for extended or low surface ",
    "brightness radio sources which might have been missed in the first survey .",
    "following best et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , we searched for nvss radio components within 3arcmin of the optical position of each lrg .",
    "this search radius is large enough to include both lobes of any extended or multi - component radio galaxy , but smaller than the 10arcmin separation typical of unrelated nvss sources .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the probability of finding an unrelated nvss source within 3arcmin of an arbitrary position on the sky is high ( @xmath5230% , see fig .",
    "6 of condon et al .  1998 ) , and even the probability of finding two unrelated sources within 3arcmin is @xmath5110% .",
    "of the 14,978 galaxies in the final lrg spectroscopic catalogue , 4378 had a single nvss source within 3arcmin of the optical position , and a further 1316 had two or more nvss sources within 3arcmin .",
    "we excluded all the single - component matches with offsets larger than 30arcsec , since mauch & sadler ( 2006 ) found that genuine matches of nearby galaxies with a single nvss source all have radio  optical separations smaller than 30arcsec .",
    "this left 375 candidate single - component nvss matches in addition to the 1316 candidate multi - component matches .",
    "we checked all the candidate nvss identifications by visually inspecting overlays of first and nvss radio contours onto optical images of each galaxy ( since the first contours usually allow us to unambiguously identify the host galaxy of a candidate nvss radio source ) .",
    "this visual inspection yielded a list of 322 2slaq lrgs which appeared to be genuinely associated with one or more nvss radio sources .",
    "271 of these galaxies were already identified with first radio sources ; but the remaining 51 galaxies had no corresponding source in the first catalogue , and are discussed in  3.3.2 below",
    ".    the nvss matching process allowed us to identify additional radio components , offset more than 30arcsec from the 2slaq galaxy position , for several 2slaq lrgs which had already been matched with first sources .",
    "one of these , j003754.59@xmath46002717.4 , is shown in figure  [ j0037.first ] and is a newly - discovered giant radio galaxy with a linear size of 2.0mpc . only the relatively weak central component of this source",
    "was identified in our original first matching , but the two radio hotspots , each more than 2arcmin from the 2slaq position , were easily found by inspection of the nvss overlay plot .",
    "figure [ fig.comp ] compares the total nvss and first flux densities for 2slaq lrgs which were detected in both radio surveys .",
    "note that for sources weaker than about 10mjy , the catalogued first flux densities tend to be systematically lower than those measured by nvss , mostly due to the radio emission of extended sources being resolved out by the smaller first beam ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; ivezic et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "as noted above , our nvss cross - matching identified a further 51 candidate nvss identifications of 2slaq lrgs which were not matched with radio sources in the first catalogue . while these could be variable radio sources , it is more likely that at the higher resolution of the first survey their peak surface brightnesses fall below the @xmath511mjy / beam limit of the first catalogue .",
    "three of these objects are associated with wide double sources which are listed in the first catalogue but have no catalogued first components within 30arcsec of the 2slaq galaxy .",
    "many of the remaining objects have a weak radio source at the 2slaq position which is visible in the first survey image but too faint to be listed in the first catalogue .",
    "as noted in  3.1 , the identification of distant lrgs with faint radio sources can not be done reliably using nvss data alone .",
    "of the 51 nvss radio identifications without a first catalogue match , we therefore chose to accept as genuine ids the 22 galaxies which had a weak source visible in first images at @xmath53 ( where @xmath8 is the local rms noise level in the first image ) , and within 3arcsec of the optical 2slaq position .",
    "this is a conservative approach aimed at maximizing the reliability of our 2slaq radio ids , and we recognize that it may have a small effect on the completeness of our radio sample , as discussed in  3.5.2 .",
    ".properties of the 2slaq spectroscopic sample used in our analysis and statistics of the radio detections .",

    "we need a large , uniform survey which covers a large volume at @xmath20 ( so that evolutionary effects within the sample volume can be neglected ) .",
    "we chose to use as our comparison sample the large dataset of nearby radio galaxies identified by mauch & sadler ( 2006 ) from the second data release of the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ; jones et al .",
    "the 6dfgs dr2 contains spectra of about 45,000 galaxies brighter than k=12.75mag . in the near  infrared k  band , and the 6dfgs radio galaxies identified by mauch & sadler span the redshift range @xmath56 with a median redshift of 0.073 .",
    "the large sample volume ( @xmath57mpc@xmath29 ) and shallow depth of the 6dfgs survey allow us to derive an accurate @xmath20 radio luminosity function with which to compare our 2slaq results .",
    "we note that passive evolution of the optical luminosity function of luminous red galaxies over the redshift range @xmath4 has little effect on the results of this study , since radio galaxies are known to be almost exclusively associated with the most massive and luminous galaxies at all redshifts out to @xmath58 ( rocca  volmerange et al .",
    "however , we have corrected the optical luminosities of the 2slaq galaxies to their equivalent value at @xmath59 using the same correction factors for passive evolution as wake et al .",
    "( 2006 ) the values of m@xmath60 for 2slaq lrgs in this paper should differ by less than 0.1mag from the m(r ) values measured for similar galaxies at @xmath61 .",
    "since the 2slaq lrg sample effectively excludes galaxies with absolute magnitudes fainter than m@xmath62 , we also chose to compare the 2slaq rlf with a local rlf calculated for a sample with a similar cutoff in optical luminosity . the optical luminosity function for 6dfgs galaxies ( jones et al .",
    "2006 ) has m@xmath63=@xmath4421.0mag .  and m@xmath64=@xmath4423.8mag .",
    ", so we adopted a cutoff in absolute magnitude of m@xmath65mag .",
    "( i.e. one magnitude brighter than m@xmath64 ) for our local sample in order to match the luminosity cutoff of the 2slaq sample as closely as possible .",
    "in practice , since the probability that an early  type galaxy will be a radio galaxy rises very sharply with optical luminosity , this luminosity cut has almost no effect on the measured rlf for local galaxies  only six of the 337 6dfgs radio galaxies with radio luminosities p@xmath66whz@xmath3 are excluded by our cutoff in m@xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig.rlf ] compares the 6dfgs and 2slaq rlfs for the range in radio luminosity for which they overlap . the 2slaq rlf is higher than the local value at all luminosities , but the difference is most striking for the most powerful radio galaxies in our sample",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure [ fig.evol1 ] , which plots the ratio of the space densities of 2slaq and 6dfgs radio galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig.evol1 ] strongly suggests that low ",
    "power radio galaxies undergo cosmic evolution , though their evolution is less dramatic than that seen in powerful radio galaxies .",
    "the redshift evolution of a galaxy population can be investigated by comparing the measured luminosity function of the same population at two or more epochs .",
    "any shift in the luminosity function is usually represented by one of two simple extremes : _ luminosity evolution _ , in which the luminosity functions are matched by shifting one of them horizontally ; and _ density evolution _ , in which the shift is vertical .",
    "these alternatives are equally plausible for a pure power  law luminosity function , but can in principle be distinguished if the luminosity function undergoes a change in slope at some luminosity .",
    "as noted by peacock ( 1999 ) the physical motivation for either of these descriptions is weak .",
    "both luminosity and density evolution assume that the overall shape of the luminosity function remains the same at all epochs , which may not be the case .",
    "luminosity evolution suggests a population whose overall luminosity declines with time , while density evolution implies a set of objects which have constant luminosity but a range of lifetimes .",
    "it is likely that neither of these simple models completely describes the physical processes which actually occur . our main goal in this paper , however , is to determine whether low ",
    "power radio galaxies evolve with redshift and even a simple parameterization of the luminosity function is an adequate tool for testing this .    to quantify the evolution of low  power radio galaxies , we follow earlier studies in assuming that the redshift dependance can be represented by pure luminosity evolution of the form @xmath68 ( boyle et al .  1988 ) .",
    "we then find the best - fitting value for @xmath69 by dividing the radio power of each galaxy by @xmath70 for @xmath71 and minimising the @xmath72 value from the rebinned local and 2slaq rlfs for each @xmath69 .",
    "error estimates are determined by computing the value of @xmath69 for which @xmath73 , which is equivalent to @xmath74 ( lampton , margon , & bowyer 1976 ) .",
    "the fit of @xmath69 was only made for @xmath75whz@xmath3 to avoid contamination by the more strongly  evolving high  power radio galaxies in the 2slaq sample .",
    "the best fitting value for @xmath69 is @xmath76 , which implies that low ",
    "power radio galaxies in the redshift range probed by the 2slaq sample are significantly more luminous than those in the local sample .",
    "the hypothesis that low  power radio galaxies undergo no cosmic evolution can be ruled out at the 6.7@xmath8 level .",
    "figure [ fig.evol2 ] shows the 6dfgs and 2slaq rlfs shifted to redshift @xmath5=0 assuming the fitted form for the evolution .    in summary , we find that low ",
    "power radio galaxies with p@xmath77whz@xmath3 undergo significant cosmic evolution over the redshift range @xmath4 .",
    "our observations are consistent with these low  power radio galaxies undergoing pure luminosity evolution of the form ( 1+@xmath5)@xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this is close to the value of @xmath78 found by hopkins ( 2004 ) for the luminosity evolution of the radio emission from star  forming galaxies over a similar redshift range .",
    "although the number of powerful radio galaxies in our 2slaq sample is relatively small , there is some evidence that they undergo more dramatic evolution than their lower  power counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig.evol1 ] implies that the number density of the most powerful ( p@xmath79whz@xmath3 ) radio galaxies in our sample could be at least ten times higher at @xmath10 than in the local universe , though this is highly uncertain because of the small number of objects observed in this luminosity range . the 6dfgs radio  galaxy sample covers a volume of @xmath80mpc@xmath29 , i.e. almost four times the 2slaq volume , but has only four galaxies with radio luminosity above 10@xmath9whz@xmath3 , whereas the smaller 2slaq volume contains at least ten radio galaxies more powerful than @xmath81whz@xmath3 .",
    "we therefore stress that the small number of powerful radio galaxies seen at low redshift is not a volume effect .",
    "if we assume the same luminosity evolution of the form ( 1+@xmath5)@xmath31 which fits the low  power sample , then the observation of four p@xmath82whz@xmath3 radio galaxies in the 6dfgs volume implies that we would expect to see 1.23 radio galaxies with p@xmath83whz@xmath3 in the 2slaq sample volume .",
    "five are actually observed , so poisson statistics imply a probability of @xmath510.7% that the difference is due to chance .",
    "if we also take into account the formal uncertainty in the four high  power 6dfgs sources , then the significance level drops to 34% .",
    "the small number of very powerful radio galaxies in the 6dfgs and 2slaq samples therefore limits what we can say about their cosmic evolution at this stage .",
    "we note however that the observed number of powerful ( @xmath84whz@xmath3 ) radio galaxies in the 2slaq sample is consistent with a population undergoing the kind of rapid density evolution reported by willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who found an increase of 3dex in the space density of the most powerful radio galaxies over the redshift range @xmath85 .",
    "this implies a number density increasing as approximately @xmath86 , i.e. ten times as many radio galaxies at powers above 10@xmath9 in the 2slaq sample at @xmath10 as in the 6dfgs at @xmath87 , which is close to the value seen in figure [ fig.evol1 ] .",
    "as discussed briefly in  3.2.2 , radio  source statistics suggest that many of the 2slaq galaxies lie in highly  clustered environments .",
    "the 2slaq sample also contains at least two @xmath88 `` head  tail '' radio galaxies ( j135058.43@xmath44003633.5 and j143432.65@xmath44010457.3 in table 3 ) , which are often tracers of high  redshift rich clusters ( e.g. blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the clustering properties of the overall 2slaq lrg sample have recently been studied by ross et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who note that the 2slaq spectroscopic sample is biased against close ( @xmath2730arcsec ) pairs of galaxies because of the minimum fibre separation set by the 2df positioner ( the so - called `` fibre collision problem '' ) .",
    "in general , the 2slaq spectroscopic catalogue omits about 65% of objects which are within 30arcsec of another 2slaq galaxy , about half of those within 1arcmin and virtually none of those with separations larger than about 3arcmin .",
    "figure [ fig.cl ] shows an example of a pair of 2slaq radio galaxies which are almost certainly members of a cluster at @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the angular separation is just over 30arcsec , and both galaxies were observed spectroscopically . the velocity difference between these two radio galaxies is 420kms@xmath3 , typical of the velocity dispersion of galaxies in a modest - sized cluster or large galaxy group .",
    "we investigated the clustering properties of the 2slaq radio galaxies in a more quantitative way by calculating the redshift  space two  point correlation function between the 2slaq radio galaxies and the full lrg sample .",
    "the triangular points in figure [ fig.xis ] show the measured redshift  space correlation @xmath90(s ) between 303 sample 8 radio galaxies from table 3 and a set of 8656 lrgs which are also in sample 8 .",
    "further details of the calculations and sample definition are given by ross et al .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig.xis ] is the 2slaq lrg autocorrelation measured by ross et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and the solid line shows the result for the lower  redshift sdss lrgs from zehavi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) on intermediate - scales and eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at the large - scales .    as discussed by ross et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the 2slaq lrg measurements lie below the sdss lrg line .",
    "this should not necessarily be taken as evidence of evolution in the clustering properties of lrgs .",
    "although the sdss lrg survey is at lower redshift than 2slaq , it has stricter colour selection criteria and so excludes many of the bluer , less luminous lrgs which are present in the 2slaq sample .",
    "the sdss lrgs may therefore appear more clustered simply because they are on average more luminous ( and hence more biased ) than the 2slaq lrgs .",
    "interestingly , the 2slaq radio galaxies have a clustering strength which is higher than the 2slaq lrg population as a whole , but lower than the sdss lrgs .",
    "there is no @xmath91  reason to expect that radio galaxies will be clustered differently from other luminous early  type galaxies .",
    "ledlow & owen ( 1995 ) showed that the probability of a luminous early  type galaxy hosting a radio source is unaffected by its clustering environment , and blake & wall ( 2002 ) found that the angular clustering of nvss radio sources is similar to that of the general galaxy population .",
    "we have shown in table [ tab.magstats ] that the 2slaq radio galaxies are significantly more luminous than the 2slaq lrg population as a whole .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the higher clustering strength of the 2slaq radio galaxies can be explained simply by their higher luminosity , though it would be interesting to test this more explicitly .",
    "the lowest  power radio galaxies in our 2slaq sample have radio luminosities similar to those of fri radio galaxies in the local universe ( see figure [ fig.fr2 ] ) .",
    "the currently  available first and nvss radio images do not have high - enough resolution and sensitivity to allow one to distinguish reliably between fri and frii morphologies for most radio galaxies in the 2slaq sample . at this stage , therefore , it is unclear whether the different rates of cosmic evolution which we find for low  power and high  power radio galaxies represent differences between the fri and frii radio  galaxy populations , or simply a general tendency for more luminous radio galaxies to undergo more rapid luminosity evolution . deeper high  resolution radio observations of the galaxies in table 3 are needed to address this question further .",
    "feedback from agn heating , and specifically mechanical heating of the interstellar gas by radio jets , is a recent addition to hierarchical models for the formation of massive galaxies ( e.g. croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al .",
    "2006 ) . in these models ,",
    "re - heating of cooling gas by an agn prevents low  redshift star formation from occurring in massive early  type galaxies , making it possible for hierarchical models to reproduce the observed colours and luminosity function of early  type galaxies .",
    "best et al .",
    "( 2006 ) recently derived an empirical conversion between the observed radio luminosity of an agn and the mechanical energy input into the parent galaxy , and found that the total energy input scaled roughly as p@xmath92 , where p is the total radio luminosity .",
    "if this is correct , then the global rate of agn heating in the local universe is dominated by the contribution of low  luminosity ( @xmath93p@xmath94whz@xmath3 ) radio galaxies , since these make up the great majority of radio - loud agn .",
    "our results imply that the low  power radio galaxies associated with lrgs in the local universe would typically have been at least twice as powerful at z@xmath510.5 and ( by extrapolation ) perhaps five times as powerful at @xmath95 .",
    "if the same kind of evolution also occurs for radio galaxies weaker than those observed here , then the total energy input from agn heating in massive early  type galaxies would have been up to 50% higher at @xmath96 than in the local universe , and perhaps twice as high at @xmath21 .",
    "the rate of cosmic evolution measured for low  power radio galaxies in this study is a lower limit , since the 2slaq lrg sample has a strict colour cutoff ( as plotted in figure [ fig.phot ] ) whereas no such colour restriction was applied to the local ( 6dfgs ) radio galaxies .",
    "if there were an additional population of blue radio galaxies at redshift @xmath10 , they might be removed by the 2slaq colour selection and so missed from our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig.cpar ] plots the parameter @xmath97 against redshift for our radio  galaxy sample as well as the full 2slaq lrg sample . any recent or on - going star formation would scatter lrgs to lower values of @xmath98 in this plot , as discussed by cannon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and roseboom et al .",
    "well over 90% of 2slaq radio galaxies lie close to the locus of passively  evolving galaxies seen in the main 2slaq lrg sample , suggesting that they have undergone little or no recent star formation .",
    "cannon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have pointed out that the highest ",
    "redshift ( @xmath99 ) 2slaq lrgs have a bimodal distribution in @xmath98 , and attribute this to later  type luminous galaxies with recent star formation which have spilled across the colour  selection boundary .",
    "the region occupied by these objects is shown in figure [ fig.cpar ] .",
    "radio galaxies with ongoing star formation should also be easy to identify in this region , but very few are seen ( fewer than 5% of 2slaq radio galaxies lie near the @xmath98 boundary in figure [ fig.cpar ] ) .",
    "we therefore estimate that only a small number of star  forming radio galaxies are being excluded from our sample by the 2slaq colour cuts .",
    "a second consideration is the cutoff in optical luminosity set by the 2slaq @xmath100magnitude limit for 2df spectroscopy .",
    "the effect of this is to set a fairly sharp boundary in at m@xmath101 , as can be seen in figure [ fig.fr2 ] .",
    "this corresponds to a lower limit of about @xmath102m@xmath103 in stellar mass if we adopt the values of log(m / l)@xmath104 used by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in the local universe ,",
    "as discussed in  5.3.1 , this cutoff would have little or no effect on measurements of the radio luminosity function .",
    "this is confirmed by the recent work of best et al .",
    "( 2005b ) who find that fewer than 1% of sdss galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath102m@xmath103 host a radio  loud agn , even at radio luminosities an order of magnitude lower than those considered here . at @xmath10",
    ", however , this is not necessarily the case , and it is possible that galaxies below the 2slaq cutoff in optical luminosity could host significant numbers of radio galaxies . because of this caveat , we stress that the radio luminosity functions derived in this paper apply to optically bright early  type galaxies . if less ",
    "luminous galaxies also contribute significantly to the radio luminosity function in the 2slaq redshift range , then the overall rate of cosmic evolution in the radio  galaxy population would be even higher than the values derived in  5.3 .",
    "the main results of this study are :    * we have measured an accurate radio luminosity function for luminous early  type galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 , and compared this with the radio luminosity function for the same population in the local universe .",
    "this allows us to measure the cosmic evolution of agn - related radio emission in a single , well - defined galaxy population .",
    "* we find clear evidence that low ",
    "power radio galaxies ( i.e. those in the luminosity range covered by local fri radio galaxies ) undergo significant cosmic evolution over the redshift range @xmath4 .",

    "most 2slaq radio galaxies show no obvious emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "the fraction showing 3727  [ oii ] emission is slightly higher than in the 2slaq lrg sample as a whole , this but this may be due to the higher optical luminosity of the radio  galaxy subsample and a more detailed analysis is needed .",
    "about 3% of the 2slaq radio galaxies show high  ionization emission lines of 3426  [ nev ] and/or 3870  [ neiii ] .",

    "further radio observations of the 2slaq area would be valuable , both at higher spatial resolution ( to test whether the fri / frii divide seen in figure [ fig.fr2 ] evolves with redshift ) and to fainter flux limits ( to probe further down the radio luminosity function ) .",
    "since the 2slaq survey also targeted qsos over a redshift range which overlaps that covered by the lrg survey , a comparison of the relative numbers of radio galaxies and radio  loud qsos in the same redshift range would give a useful test of the unified model for radio  loud agn .",

    "new radio surveys will be needed to identify and study low  power radio galaxies beyond @xmath55 in conjunction with the new generation of large - area spectroscopic surveys , though the existing first and nvss surveys will still be able to detect many of the most powerful radio galaxies out to @xmath95 .",

    "<S> we have combined optical data from the 2df - sdss luminous red galaxy and qso ( 2slaq ) redshift survey with radio measurements from the 1.4ghz vla first and nvss surveys to identify a volume  limited sample of 391 radio galaxies at redshift @xmath0 . by determining an accurate radio luminosity function for luminous early  type galaxies in this redshift range </S>",

    "<S> the evolution seen in the low  power radio - galaxy population implies that the total energy input into massive early  type galaxies from agn heating increases with redshift , and was at least 50% higher at @xmath10 ( the median redshift of the 2slaq lrg sample ) than in the local universe . </S>",
