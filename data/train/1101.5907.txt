    "chirality in nuclear physics relates to features of nuclear hamiltonian in the context of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the phenomenon of explicit time - reversal symmetry breaking comes up through already well known cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix of the standard model .",
    "the ckm matrix , introduced in order to diagonalize the mass terms given by higgs mechanism with respect to quark flavor , contains t violating terms being associated with the heavy quark sector .",
    "therefore no explicit t violation is expected to be present in low energy nuclear interactions giving t - symmetric nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "what remains is the mechanism of spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking and possible occurrence of spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry .",
    "this possibility has been studied for several years through the measurements of the energy levels and gamma transition probabilities @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the latter ones have been intensively studied in the mass regions of a=130 and a=100 , while the specific gamma selection rules , i.e. staggering of the b(m1 ) values along the rotational bands have been observed only in cs isotopes @xcite .",
    "absence of the b(m1 ) staggering in other nuclei is intriguing and needs clarification what is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "although spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking is responsible for the phenomenon of chirality , there are no eigenstates of t operator and therefore the symmetry operator t alone is not used in the quantum - mechanical description of this problem .",
    "however , one can introduce another symmetry operator @xmath0 being a combination of time - reversal and @xmath1-rotation , that allows proper description of t - symmetry breaking and simultaneously possesses its own eigenstates .",
    "the @xmath0 is called t - signature @xcite or chiral symmetry @xcite operator .",
    "as stated above , nuclear hamiltonian h is expected to be t symmetric . additionally , h is also rotationally invariant in the absence of external fields . as a result ,",
    "the eigenstates of h are assigned to spin and spin projection quantum numbers @xmath2 , and the following commutation relation is valid @xmath3=0.\\ ] ] the commutation relation ( [ commutation_1 ] ) shows that if @xmath4 is an eigenstate of h with the eigenvalue @xmath5 , then @xmath6 must also be the eigenstate of h with the same eigenvalue @xmath7 the @xmath0 operator is anti - unitary the action of which makes complex conjugation of all complex numbers .",
    "therefore , it does matter which part of the eqn .",
    "( [ eigenstates ] ) the operator acts on , and the appearance of the round bracket in the eqn .",
    "( [ eigenstates ] ) is necessary .",
    "the round bracket shows that @xmath8 acts only on the @xmath9 . skipping this bracket equals to the complex conjugation of the whole matrix element @xmath10 spin and its projection",
    "are not changed by acting of @xmath0 operator @xcite , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a complex number .",
    "the above equation shows that eigenstates of the hamiltonian are the eigenstates of the symmetry operator @xmath0 as well and , therefore , they preserve the chiral symmetry . owing to the fact that eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are real values , one can show that @xmath12 must be phase only ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 the above analysis relates to diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian but it can be generalized .",
    "particularly , it is possible to make any matrix element of any operator @xmath15 commuting with @xmath0 to be real by choosing the phase @xmath16 @xmath17 the choice of this special phase @xmath16 introduces a phase convention @xcite , and this convention has to be kept for the further analysis .",
    "in the most simple case of chirality , the nuclei are described as three - body objects being composed of two odd nucleons and an even - even core",
    ". therefore presence of three angular momenta vectors forming a system with definite handedness is expected in tandem with specific conditions where one of the odd nucleons possesses particle - like character , the other one hole - like character and a core is triaxially deformed .",
    "for that reason , apart of the eigenstate basis @xmath2 one can introduce equivalent basis set in which the handedness of the nucleus is specified . although the handedness , being dependent on the angular momenta vectors orientation , is a continuous parameter , it can be classified in two values @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponding to the left- or right - handedness of the system .",
    "the elements of the new basis set have several interesting features .",
    "in contrast to the matrix elements calculated on the @xmath2 states being real , the matrix elements calculated on the @xmath20 , @xmath21 are complex since @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "this means also that they relate to dynamical features of the nucleus .",
    "the states with specified handedness break the chiral symmetry since they are not the eigenstates of the @xmath0 symmetry operator i.e. @xmath22",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 not being the eigenstates of the hamiltonian posses an essential dynamical feature , i.e. the system can tunnel between left- and right - handed configurations @xmath23 one can estimate the tunneling frequency as @xmath24hz by taking the ratio @xmath25 , where @xmath26 kev is typical energy splitting observed in the chiral nuclei ( see following sections ) .",
    "since the time of gamma quanta emission is larger than the tunneling period , it is not possible to observe such fast dynamical process experimentally through electromagnetic radiation . in this case",
    "the time scale of the measurement is much larger than the characteristic time of the tunneling process . following the indeterminacy principle ,",
    "the states with definite energy and undefined time are observed experimentally , i.e. only the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath2 are visible .",
    "therefore the @xmath20 and @xmath21 states have to be projected on @xmath2 basis elements in order to compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental observations .",
    "the projection procedure is also called symmetry restoration . in the case of the chiral symmetry the rotational as well as the t - symmetry ( chirality ) has to be restored .",
    "rotational symmetry can be restored in the spirit of generator coordinate method method ( see sect .",
    "11.4.6 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) by using projection operators @xmath27 @xmath28 where the handedness is not affected by spin projection since there is no @xmath0 in the operators @xmath27 .",
    "indices @xmath29 in eqs .",
    "( [ rzutowanko1 ] ) and ( [ rzutowanko2 ] ) stand for quantum numbers  like spin of the core @xmath30 and of the odd nucleons @xmath31 , @xmath32 etc .  related to structural composition of the partner band levels .",
    "these quantum numbers will be omitted in order to examine the role of the handedness only .",
    "the spin quantum number is not affected by action of @xmath0 operator since according to eq.(1 - 39 ) of ref.@xcite it fulfills the following commutation relations @xmath33 & = & 0 \\\\ \\label{kolejnosc2 } \\left [ r_y^t , i^2 \\right ] & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the restoration of the chiral symmetry ( projection of chirality quantum number @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) have the following form @xmath36 being the normalization factors .",
    "the @xmath37 states form chiral doubles that can be observed experimentally .",
    "these doublets form two chiral partner bands .",
    "phases of @xmath37 states have been chosen so as to fulfill the phase convention given by eq .",
    "( 1 - 38 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . the formulae ( [ kolejnosc1],[kolejnosc2 ] ) show that the order of the projections can be reversed and one can project on the chirality first and then on the spin quantum number .",
    "the probabilities of the electromagnetic transitions linking the excited states in the chiral bands relate to the matrix elements of the electromagnetic transition operator @xmath38 calculated on the laboratory states @xmath39 . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath38 fulfills the following commutation relation ( see also eqs .",
    "( 1a-73 ) and ( 3c-10 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath40 = 0\\ ] ] @xmath41 being the m1 , e2 , m3 , e4 , ... transition type .",
    "this commutation relation , together with the introduced phase convention makes all matrix elements of the electromagnetic transitions between the @xmath42 states real values and that for the inband electromagnetic transition @xmath43 , i.e. without chirality change , will assume the following form @xmath44 and , accordingly , for the @xmath45 interband transition that changes chirality @xmath46 one has to remember that matrix elements of @xmath47 and @xmath48 states take in general complex values .",
    "relations ( [ creversed ] ) , ( [ chiral1 ] ) and ( [ chiral2 ] ) , ( [ emreversed ] ) lead to the following expressions @xmath49 the above relations show that summation and subtraction of complex conjugate values occurs in the matrix elements given by eqs.([inbandmt ] ) and ( [ interbandmt ] )",
    ". therefore , the inband matrix element , @xmath50 , takes the final form @xmath51 and the interband matrix element , @xmath52 , transforms to @xmath53 no imaginary unit appeares in equations ( [ innband]),([innterband ] ) which is due to the the chosen phase convention .",
    "these equations are valid when the chiral symmetry is close to the strong symmetry breaking limit . when this limit is attained , the tunneling effect between the left- and right - handed states disappears , which means that @xmath54 .",
    "the left- and right - handed states are separated @xmath55 which means that normalization parameters @xmath56 equal to unity .",
    "gamma transitions of m1 and e2 type can not change right - handed state to the left - handed one i.e. @xmath57 ( @xmath41= m1 , e2 ) since larger angular momentum change of the nuclear state would be required .",
    "in this case eqs .",
    "( [ innband ] , [ innterband ] ) reduce to @xmath58 @xmath15 being the m1 or e2 electromagnetic transition operator .",
    "the above equations show that in the case of a strong chiral symmetry breaking limit , the b(m1 ) and b(e2 ) transition probabilities in both bands should be identical .",
    "moreover , equations ( [ inband ] ) and ( [ interband ] ) show that if the dominating part of the @xmath59 matrix element is real then the inband electromagnetic transition should mainly be observed . on the contrary",
    ", if the imaginary part of the @xmath59 matrix element dominates then the interband electromagnetic transition should be in favor of the inband one .",
    "these features are observed in the majority of partner bands in which lifetimes of the excited states have been measured .",
    "the role of the specified handedness of the intrinsic states is then explained .",
    "staggering of the b(m1 ) value as a function of spin can not be attributed only to the existence of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 states in a quantum system .",
    "this effect , as discussed in ref.@xcite , relates to properties ( here called structural composition ) that can occur in addition with the chiral symmetry breaking . in the quoted paper ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the model consisting of a triaxially deformed core coupled to one proton particle and one neutron hole in the same single-@xmath60 shell was examined .",
    "such a hamiltonian , appropriate for the description of chiral bands built on two quasi - particle @xmath61 configuration , possesses additional invariances and corresponding quantum numbers .",
    "these quantum numbers have been used to derive the gamma selection rules which are based on the fact that the core angular momentum change for e2 and m1 transitions is @xmath62 .",
    "this special feature of core rotation is due to its triaxial deformation .",
    "staggering of the b(m1 ) transition probabilities relates therefore to the structural composition of the laboratory states and can be explained by examining the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 quantum numbers in matrix elements @xmath63 . if some of the conditions given in ref .",
    "@xcite were not fulfilled then b(m1 ) staggering should vanish .",
    "nonetheless , other properties related to the existence of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 states could still be observed .",
    "such a situation takes place in @xmath64rh nuclei where partner bands are expected to be built on the configuration consisting of different @xmath60-shell levels @xcite @xcite , @xcite , as well as in the @xmath65nd isotope where partner bands are assumed to be built on the three ( instead of two ) quasiparticle configuration @xcite .",
    "lifetimes of the excited states were measured in partner bands of @xmath66rh @xcite and @xmath65nd @xcite and , indeed , the staggering of b(m1 ) transition probability observed in those bands is very weak ( compared to that for cs isotopes ) or absent .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath65nd the corresponding transition probabilities in the partner bands are almost equal .",
    "this points to the strong chiral symmetry breaking limit in @xmath65nd and reflects different structural composition than in cs isotopes .",
    "these examples indicate that b(m1 ) staggering should be a sensitive measure of triaxiality in two - quasiparticle single @xmath60-shell configurations .",
    "the dependence of the b(m1 ) staggering on triaxial deformation has been studied in terms of the cqpc model @xcite where indeed the staggering effect vanishes rapidly when @xmath67-deformation deviates from 30@xmath68 .",
    "this fact supports the role of the structural composition in description of the electromagnetic properties of the partner bands .",
    "it follows from the above considerations that the chiral symmetry breaking in nuclear physics leads to the existence of two rotational bands , almost degenerated with similar electromagnetic properties . staggering of the b(m1 ) value quoted in many papers is an additional property originating from the structural composition of a given nucleus .",
