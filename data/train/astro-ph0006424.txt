    "type ia supernov have been shown to be powerful cosmological distance indicators useful for the determination of the expansion rate @xmath4 and the density parameters for matter and vacuum energy @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( riess et al .",
    "@xcite ; perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as such",
    ", they are the subject of intense study and a number of nearby and distant supernova searches have been launched .",
    "studies of type ia light - curve shapes , peak magnitudes , colors and spectra have been performed in order to get better insight into the nature of these exploding stars .",
    "supernova rates , and in particular their evolution as a function of redshift , is another probe provided by supernova science .",
    "not only are these rates important for tracking the chemical evolution of the universe , but as a tracer of stellar evolution , they also contain information on which type of progenitor system produces type ia supernov . if the evolution of the supernova rate is understood , they may also be used to determine the cosmological parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 via the number count - redshift relationship . with enough statistics , it is possible to measure the supernova luminosity function which is of critical importance for understanding malmquist bias .",
    "the supernova rate has been measured at low redshift in searches based on visual scanning of photographic plates ( cappellaro et al .",
    "@xcite ) . at high",
    "redshift the rate has been measured with automatic subtraction of ccd images ( pain et al .",
    "the supernova rate for nearby galaxies has previously been estimated using ccd data by muller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . here",
    "we report the first measurement of the rate for low redshift galaxies using ccds and with a full numerical calculation of the detection efficiency .",
    "the search was performed by eros ( exprience de recherche dobjets sombres ) .    in 1990",
    "eros engaged in a search for massive compact halo objects ( machos ) via gravitational microlensing . since 1996 eros has been using a dedicated 1 meter telescope , the marly telescope , at the eso la silla observatory . the telescope is equipped with two detector mosaics , each consisting of eight 2048@xmath72048 pixel ccds covering a @xmath8 @xmath9 field .",
    "a dichroic cube allows the simultaneous recording of two images in wide ( @xmath10 nm ) non - standard red ( @xmath11 nm ) and visible ( @xmath12 nm ) bands hereafter referred to as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the telescope , camera and telescope operation are described in bauer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the greater part of eros observing time is devoted to the search for microlensing events by observing the magellanic clouds , the galactic bulge and the galactic disk ( see _ e.g. _ palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "@xcite ; derue et al .",
    "however , eros also devotes 10% of its observing time to the observation of fields at high galactic latitudes in order to search for supernov at low redshifts and to measure stellar proper motions .",
    "the eros supernova search aims at discovering a homogeneous sample of supernov in the low redshift range .",
    "our main scientific goals are the derivation of the nearby supernova rates , and the study of the empirical correlation of the peak luminosity with the light - curve shape .",
    "eros has discovered more than 60 supernov since 1997 .    in this paper",
    ", we present a measurement of the type ia supernova explosion rate . because of backgrounds due to variable stars and asteroids , we restricted the search to identified galaxies . to derive a total supernova rate",
    ", we therefore assume that the rate for a given galaxy is proportional to the galactic luminosity .",
    "for this low statistic supernova sample , no attempt is made to derive rates for different galaxy types .    in section 2 , we give the details of our supernova search that are relevant for the rate determination . in section 3",
    "we present the subset of data considered in this analysis and the supernov we found .",
    "the galaxy sample for the supernova search is described in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we describe the determination of our detection efficiency using a monte carlo simulation and derive the supernova rate .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present a discussion and interpretation of our results .",
    "more details on this measurement can be found in hardin ( @xcite ) .",
    "we searched for supernov by comparing an image of a given field with a reference image of the same field taken at least two weeks before .",
    "the images are taken during dark time .",
    "only the visible band images are used for the search , but we use both bands when computing the absolute calibration of the images .",
    "the technique is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rcs ] .",
    "each observation consists of two five minute exposures which are combined to form a ten minute exposure after identification of cosmic rays .",
    "five to ten fields were observed each night . for the observations used in this paper , calibration fields ( landolt @xcite )",
    "were also observed before and after the series of supernova fields .",
    "this allowed us to calibrate our non - standard filters and to eliminate non - photometric nights from the rate measurement .",
    "the automated processing permits the remote analysis in france on computers set up at the la silla observatory of up to 20 deg@xmath15 during the day following the night of observation .",
    "since the processing is monitored from france , it requires robustness and a limited volume of output .",
    "the method for comparing the reference and the search images is as follows .",
    "the reference image is aligned geometrically and photometrically with the search image , and the image of superior seeing is convolved to match the point spread function ( psf ) of the other image .",
    "the two images are then subtracted and the frame thus obtained is searched for star - like sources .",
    "the selection of the candidate supernov is performed by applying a set of cuts on the objects detected on the subtracted frame .",
    "these cuts are tuned with a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the first and most important cut is applied on the total flux of the candidate , and is equivalent to a limiting magnitude of @xmath16 . afterwards , a series of cuts involving the comparison of the candidate shape ( _ i.e. _ the second moments of a gaussian fit ) with that of the frame stars is designed to eliminate inaccurate subtractions .",
    "finally , the detection threshold is set slightly higher within 1.8 arcsec of the center of bright galaxies .",
    "the treatment ends with the visual scanning of @xmath17 candidates per square degree by two independent observers .",
    "most of the candidates are residual cosmic rays , subtraction artifacts , asteroids , and variable stars .",
    "the residual cosmic rays are identified by the fact that they only appear on one of the two five minute exposures .",
    "asteroids and variable stars are eliminated by requiring the candidate to appear in or near a host identified as a galaxy . as a consequence of this last requirement , no supernov with an undetected host can be found .",
    "this is taken into account in the calculation of the search efficiency .",

[ err ] have been added in quadrature .",
    "the statistical error corresponds to a 68% confidence level .",
    "this rate compares well with the rate derived by cappellaro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from the combined sample of five nearby photographic searches , @xmath33 snu at a mean redshift of @xmath34 .",
