    "it is widely accepted that the magnetic free energy stored in corona is the main energy source responsible for powering solar flares .",
    "storage of magnetic free energy requires a non - potential magnetic field , which is always shown up as a sheared and/or twisted magnetic structure @xcite . in the processes of solar flares ,",
    "magnetic free energy is converted to thermal and kinetic energy of plasma via the dissipation of electric current , accompanied with topological change of magnetic field to a lower energy state than pre - flare state .",
    "this scenario can successfully interpret many observational features of solar flares .",
    "however , the detailed evolution of such coronal phenomena has not been fully understood yet , especially in the process of energy release @xcite , due to the lack of direct quantitative measurements of the coronal magnetic field in the source region @xcite .",
    "the microwave spectral fine structures provide a unique diagnostics of the magnetic field and ambient plasma around the source . zebra pattern ( zp ) is one of the most intriguing spectral structures in the solar radio emission , which consists of a number of almost parallel and equidistant stripes superimposed on the background type iv radio burst in dynamic spectrum .",
    "they have been recorded and studied for several decades @xcite in metric & decimetric wavelength , and later in microwave range .",
    "there are several theoretical model proposed to interpret the formation of zp structures .",
    "the model of bernstein mode ( bm model : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the first one to interpret such fine structure .",
    "another important model is whistler wave model , based on the interaction between plasma electrostatic waves and whistler waves .",
    "the most developed model for zp is the double plasma resonance model ( dpr model : * ? ? ?",
    "the detail information related to these theoretical models can be found in the reviews @xcite .",
    "the microwave zps are closely related to the inhomogeneous plasma and magnetic field around flaring regions in corona by dpr model . according to this model ,",
    "the emission source is considered as magnetic flux tube filled with nonequilibrium energetic particles .",
    "the anisotropic distribution of energetic particles in flux tube develops kinetic instabilities , and stimulates electrostatic waves .",
    "the excitation of dominating electrostatic upper hybrid waves are greatly enhanced at some resonance levels , where the upper hybrid frequency @xmath3 is close to the harmonics of electron cyclotron frequency @xmath4 in flux tube : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the plasma frequency of electrons , and s is the harmonic number .",
    "then these waves escape from the local regions through some nonlinear plasma processes as they are transformed to transverse waves .",
    "it is generally considered that the emission of microwave fine structures like zp requires high density and high temperature , which coincides with the situation of the expected primary energy release site of flare , implies that the source of microwave zp may be located near the flare core region where the magnetic energy is released .",
    "this also indicates that parameters analysis of zps may present some features of the flaring core region . @xcite",
    "estimated the ratio between the plasma density scale height @xmath0 and the magnetic field scale height @xmath1 derived from three zps in an x3.4 solar flare event on 2006 december 13 observed by the chinese solar broadband radio spectrometer ( sbrs / huairou ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by dpr model .",
    "it is pointed out that the @xmath2 decreases by a factor of 2 from the impulsive phase of the flare to its maximum .",
    "this is the motivation behind this work : now that the @xmath2 is closely related to the geometrical structure of coronal magnetic field , the topological change of magnetic field during energy releasing process would leave a trace on the @xmath2 , i.e. , zp is an indirect tracker of the physical process of solar flare .    with the aid of high - temporal , high - spectral resolution observation data obtained at the sbrs / huairou in 2.63.8 ghz @xcite , we are encouraged to take a step forward to address this issue . in this work",

    "the contours show the microwave intensity at 17 ghz observed by nobeyama radio heliograph ( norh ) . the first phase ( fig.[fig-4]a ) is characterized by a east - west , highly sheared , bundle of nearly parallel loops .",
    "the ratio fluctuates in the range between 3.50 and 5.00 ( fig.[fig-3]a ) .",
    "figure [ fig-4]b shows a zp started at 02:22:30 ut and the ratio is 3.90 .",
    "similar to figure [ fig-2 ] , but only one spectrogram on rhcp is demonstrated , based on the polarization of the zp . at the end of the first phase , significant energy release is processing as several saturated brightenings showing up along the elongated structure between 02:22:1802:24:18 ut .",
    "also noted is the coronal structure underwent a topological change that a north - south , less sheared , expanding arcade structure ( fig.[fig-4]c ) was formed . in the second phase ,",
    "the ratio has decreased to around 2.00 ( fig.[fig-4]d ) .",
    "the contours of norh 17 ghz intensity ( fig.[fig-4]a and [ fig-4]c ) show that the microwave sources in the two phases have approximately the same positions , coincident with the position of the x - ray loops structure , supposes that the radiation of zps may come from the x - ray bright loops .",
    "on 2002 april 21 , an x1.5/1f class , two ribbons flare occurred in active region noaa 9906 close at the western solar limb ( s14w84 ) .",

    "zps in this event ( fig.[fig-5]b and [ fig-5]d ) possess intricate and long - lasting stripes @xcite , which are far more complicated than the zps in the 2006 december 13 event and the 2001 october 19 event .",
    "about 10 zps were observed in the time interval of 01:4002:05 ut .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for instance , the third and forth `` zps '' in this event are not two separate zps , but one long - lasting zp structure with fast - varying frequency parameter , therefore we treated the zp as two separate zps .",
    "figure [ fig-3]b shows the variation of the ratio @xmath2 in this flare event . different from the `` two - phase '' pattern in the 2006 december 13 event , the ratio decreases slowly during the flaring process .",
    "figure [ fig-5 ] illustrates the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) euv images at 195   superposed with norh 17 ghz contours , and the corresponding zps in this event . a rising post - flare loop system , at a rate of about 10 km s@xmath43 @xcite ,",
    "was seen during 01:4002:05 ut . by comparing the coronal structure we found that the coronal configuration does not show so significant change in the flaring process .",
    "the contours of norh 17 ghz show the emission mainly came from the foot - point and the top of the coronal loops .",
    "the siberian solar radio telescope ( ssrt ) data at 5.7 ghz indicates that microwave source was located on the top of the coronal loops .",
    "a x1.6/2b class two - ribbon flare occurred in active region noaa 9661 ( n16w18 ) around 00:47 ut on 2001 october 19 .",
    "a detailed study on multi - wavelength involved in this event was carried out by @xcite .",
    "the flare started at 00:47 ut , reached maximum at around 01:05 ut , and ended at 01:13 ut .",
    "18 zps were recorded in the time interval 00:5001:20 ut .",
    "the variation of the ratio @xmath2 in this event ( fig.[fig-3]c ) shows a similar `` two - phase '' pattern occurred in the event of 13 december 2006 . in the first phase ,",
    "8 zps were recorded and the ratio is 2.754.19 ; the other 10 zps are observed in the second phase and the ratio decreases to 1.673.17 .",

    "no zp was recorded in the transition between the first and the second phase . in the second phase ,",
    "the coronal loops evolved to a expanding post - flare loops configuration in 171   images ( fig.[fig-6]c ) .",
    "figure [ fig-6]d shows the corresponding zp appeared at 01:19 ut and the ratio is around 2.00 .",

    ", the microwave emission originated mainly from the two foot - points of the coronal loops .",
    "about 3 minutes later , the microwave sources gradually converged to the loop top and changed little morphologically thereafter .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the variation of 74 microwave zps recorded by sbrs / huairou at 2.63.8 ghz in 9 eruptive solar flares . by analyzing zp stripes appeared in flares",
    ", we calculated the ratio @xmath2 in emission sources .",
    "we have obtained following results .",
    "for all the cases , the ratio @xmath2 prior to the flaring peaks tend to be larger than those after the peaks .",
    "the ratio mainly concentrate in the range of 3 - 5 before the flaring peaks except for the case of 2002 april 21 .",
    "after the free energy releases , the ratio drops to about 2 . among these cases",
    ", we found 3 typical flares whose zps appeared in both of before and after the flaring peaks . in the cases of 2006",
    "december 13 and 2001 october 19 , the ratio displays a step - wise decrease during the processes of energy releasing . in the case of 2002",
    "april 21 , the ratio shows a tendency of slow decrease .",
    "the decrease of the ratio reveals that the magnetic field scale height increases faster relative to the plasma density scale height during the flaring process , implies the presence of a relaxation process of the magnetic field relative to the plasma density .",
    "we compare the x - ray / euv images taken before and after the step - wise decrease of the ratio @xmath2 of the three events .",
    "the coronal configuration underwent a topological change after the release of the stored free energy , reveals a sigmoid - to - arcade transformation during flaring process in the events of 2006 december 13 and 2001 october 19 .",
    "as well accepted , the shape of x - ray / euv loops infers the current - free magnetic field lines .",
    "the loop arcades after the topological change showing a relaxed form of magnetic field configuration , implies that the topological change of magnetic field in flaring region is a process toward a relaxed , potential state by releasing the magnetic shear @xcite . in the case of 2002",
    "april 21 , the euv images do not see so significant change in coronal magnetic field configuration in this event .",
    "we check the norh observations of these three flare events .",
    "the microwave sources of zps were located on the bright flare loops observed at euv / x - ray band .",
    "the height of source regions of zps were estimated to be about 66 mm @xcite , right in the altitude range of @xmath44 mm to @xmath45 mm where the magnetic nonpotentiality decreases after the flare event of 2006 december 13 @xcite .",
    "this entirely agreement supports the validity of the relation between the @xmath2 variation and the energy release .",
    "when we suppose that the @xmath2 is determined by the geometrical structure of magnetic field and the plasma density , then the step - wise decreases of @xmath2 ( fig.[fig-3]a and [ fig-3]c ) may be related to the topological change on the coronal magnetic field structure , whereas the slowly varying @xmath2 ( fig.[fig-3]b ) infers no significant change of coronal magnetic field , then our results favor the @xmath2 variation being due to the topological change of flare core region where the main part of the magnetic energy is released .",
    "figure [ fig-7 ] illustrates the picture of the ratio before and after the topological change . for a typical value of the ratio ,",
    "the magnetic field scale height @xmath1 is 1/4 of the plasma density scale height @xmath0 before the topological change .",
    "after the topological change processing , @xmath1 becomes 1/2 of @xmath0 .",
    "this result may constrain the solar flare modeling to some extent .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 plays a significant role in the dpr model @xcite .",
    "however the absolute values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are even more important .",
    "the smaller these values are , the more stripes of a zp can be realized in certain frequency range .",
    "we noted that , from table [ tbl-1 ] , the numbers of zebra stripes varied from event to event , especially for the event of 2002 april 21 which is up to 34 .",
    "in other words , the absolute values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 varied in different events . whereas , the ratio @xmath2 is mainly in the range of 1.55 , as shown in figure [ fig-2 ] , which is independent from the varied absolute values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    here , it is worth discussing the validity in particular flare event , e.g. , the event of 2002 april 21 with the fact that up to 34 zp stripes existed simultaneously in a short frequency range . in this event , for @xmath46 mhz",
    ", we could obtain the magnetic field @xmath47 gs , calculated from equation ( [ equ-3 ] ) @xmath48 , which is corresponding to altitude of @xmath49 mm @xcite . while from the plasma frequency @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath53 , one can get @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 seems over high at this altitude of @xmath57 mm , according to current knowledge .",
    "thus , this is a major obstacle for the dpr model to produce 34 zp stripes simultaneously at 2.63.8 ghz range in this event .",
    "similar calculation had been carried out showing that the dpr model fails to interpret the formation of a large number of zp stripes @xcite .",
    "ww model was proposed to be responsible for the formation of the multi - stripes zp structures in this event , as the ratio @xmath2 is not a significant parameter in the ww model , but the absolute value of magnetic field b is .",
    "the magnetic field b can be estimated to be a reasonable value of @xmath58 gs with the formula @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the frequency separation between two adjacent zp stripes @xcite .",
    "finally , it needs to be mentioned that it deserves further investigation as to answer why the @xmath2 is 35 and 2 , before and after the energy releasing process , respectively . additionally ,",
    "although the radio heliograph observations suggest that the microwave zps may come from the flare loops , we have no enough evidence to confirm that the zps originated from the same position in flare loops because it is difficult to obtain the accurate position of radio source region due to a lack of high - spatial and high - temporal radio imaging observation in the corresponding frequency range ( 2.63.8 ghz ) . the constructing high - spatial and high - temporal resolution chinese spectral radio heliograph",
