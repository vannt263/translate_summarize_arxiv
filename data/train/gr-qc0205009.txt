    "the search for the topology of our universe has made tremendous progress in the past years and several methods have been designed using either galaxy catalogs or the cmb ( see e.g.  @xcite for general reviews ) .",
    "the most promising dataset that can eventually contain a topological signature is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the form of pattern correlations ( such as homologous circles in the sky  @xcite , or anomalously large temperature correlations in a set of directions  @xcite , see  @xcite for a recent review on the cmb methods ) or non gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "the detectability of the topology in datasets such as those that will be made available by the map  @xcite and planck  @xcite satellite missions requires to simulate maps with the topological signature for a large set of topologies .",
    "these maps will have mainly two uses : first , they will allow us to test the detection method and for instance estimate its running time and second , once all sources of noises are added , it will help us investigating to which extent a given method is well suited to detect the topological signal and indeed if it is not blurred ( in the same spirit as the investigation of the  crystallographic \" methods based on galaxy catalogs  @xcite ) .",
    "a prerequisite for any further study is thus to simulate cmb maps with a topological signal .    at present",
    ", the status of the constraint on the topology of the universe is sparse .",
    "concerning locally euclidean spaces , it was shown on the basis of the cobe data that the size of the fundamental domain of a 3-torus has to be larger than @xmath0  mpc @xcite .",
    "this constraint does not exclude a toroidal universe since there can be up to @xmath1 copies of the fundamental cell within our horizon .",
    "this constraint relies mainly on the fact that the smallest wavenumber is @xmath2 , which induces a suppression of fluctuations on scales beyond the size of the fundamental domain .",
    "this result holds only for the case of a vanishing cosmological constant and was generalized to all euclidean manifolds  @xcite .",
    "a non - vanishing cosmological constant induces larger scale cosmological perturbations , via the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "for instance if @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the former is relaxed to allow for @xmath5 copies of the fundamental cell within our horizon .",
    "this constraint is also milder in the case of compact hyperbolic manifolds and it was shown  @xcite that the angular power spectrum was consistent with the cobe data on multipoles ranging from 2 to 20 for the weeks and thurston manifolds .",
    "another approach was developed in  @xcite and is based on the method of images .",
    "only one spherical space using this method of images was considered in the literature , namely the case of the projective space  @xcite .",
    "note that multiconnectedness breaks global homogeneity and isotropy ( except for the particular case of the projective space ) .",
    "it follows that the temperature angular correlation function @xmath6 will depend on the position of the observer and on the orientation of the manifold , which is at odd with the standard lore . in a simply connected universe",
    "the angular correlation function depends only on the angle between the two directions whereas in a multi - connected universe , it will depend on the two directions .",
    "it follows that the coefficients @xmath7 of the decomposition of @xmath6 into legendre polynomials , obtained by averaging over the sky , loose much of topological information .",
    "as clearly explained in  @xcite , @xmath6 can be decomposed into an isotropic and an anisotropic part and the @xmath7 depend solely on the former .",
    "the @xmath7 alone are a poor indicator of the topology , despite the fact that they can help constraining the topology , which backs up the necessity to study the full sky map .    in standard relativistic cosmology ,",
    "the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre spacetime with locally isotropic and homogeneous spatial sections .",
    "these spatial sections can be defined as the constant density or time hypersurfaces .",
    "with such a splitting , the equations of evolution of the matter and geometry perturbations that will give birth to the large scale structures of the universe reduce to a set of coupled differential equations involving a laplacian ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "> from this classification , it can be shown that there are three categories of spherical 3-manifolds .    *",
    "the _ single action manifolds _ are those for which a subgroup @xmath55 of @xmath57 acts as pure right - handed clifford translations .",

    "ikeda  @xcite extended this result to show that if two 3-dimensional spherical manifolds are isospectral then they are isometric . combining this with previous results , it follows that a 3-dimensional spherical manifold is completely determined , as a riemannian manifold , by its spectrum .",

    "we can estimate that @xmath266 and thus that the cut in the osw contribution is expected to be round @xmath267,\\ ] ] the factor 2 arising from the fact that an oscillation corresponds to 2 zero .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the previous estimate ( [ i9 ] ) .      in the spherical case",
    "we expect the same kind of effects , i.e. a suppression of the large scale isw effect due of the existence of a maximal wavelength",
    ". the osw term will be approximatively the same as the one computed in the flat case since our universe , even if closed , is still very flat .",
    "let us first remark a crucial difference between euclidean manifolds and spherical manifolds .",
    "for the former , as we have seen in the previous section , the smallest multipole is directly related to the size @xmath56 of the fundamental polyhedron so that one can not consider too small universes . for spherical universes",
    ", the situation is _ a priori _ different .",
    "as seen on the example of single - action manifolds , the value of the first non - zero eigenvalue does not depend on the order of the group , at least for cyclic and binary dihedral groups .",
    "let us take the example of lens spaces , the first nonzero eigenvalue is indeed the same for all @xmath268 ( @xmath269 ) , namely @xmath270 and eigenvalue 2(2 + 2 ) = 8 .",
    "however , the multiplicity is 3 for homogeneous lens spaces @xmath271 , but only 1 for nonhomogeneous lens spaces @xmath79 , as shown in table 1 of  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the space is becoming smaller and smaller in _ only one _ direction . in perpendicular directions",
    "the space remains large .",
    "the waves do not have distinct peaks ( like mountaintops found in nature ) but rather have ridges ( perfect horizontal ridges , which are never found in nature ) .",
    "first imagine a wave in @xmath22 , as follows : the set of maxima is a great circle , while the set of minima is a complementary great circle .",
    "as time passes , the wave goes up and down , so what is the top at a time @xmath272 becomes the bottom at time @xmath273 say , and vice versa , returning to its original position at time @xmath274 .",
    "midway between the  top ridge \" and the  bottom ridge \" is a torus which remains at height 0 for all times @xmath18 . in toroidal coordinates ( [ coordinatedefinition ] ) , one ridge is the circle at @xmath275 , the other ridge is the circle at @xmath276 , and fixed torus lies at @xmath277 .",
    "this wave is preserved by _ all _ corkscrew motions along the natural axes , so it projects down to an eigenmode of _ all _ lens spaces @xmath79 . in the notations of section  [ sec_torus ] , it is given in toroidal coordinates as @xmath278 thus verifying that it is a wave as described above , and in particular with no dependence on @xmath134 or @xmath279 .",
    "in the special case of a homogeneous lens space @xmath271 , we get two more eigenmodes @xmath280 these modes are constant along helices ( where @xmath281 is constant ) , so they are eigenmodes of all homogeneous lens spaces , whose holonomies are clifford translations , but not eigenmodes of nonhomogeneous lens spaces .",
    "we thus expect the effect of the cut - off in the sachs - wolfe plateau to be milder than for euclidean spaces .",
    "but , on the other hand we expect to have a more irregular sachs - wolfe plateau due of the fact that some wavelengths are missing from the spectrum .",
    "another observational consequences missed by the angular power spectrum is a global large scale anisotropy that , at least , is expected for non - homogeneous lens spaces .    to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the simplest example @xmath175 for which half of the modes have disappeared so that @xmath282 , @xmath81 being an integer .",

    "we thus expect that the @xmath7 curve oscillates around @xmath286}}/2 $ ] with a frequency of order @xmath287 .",
    "using the coefficients ( [ 5 ] ) for the projective space , we plot in figure  [ fig9 ] , the function @xmath241 for @xmath288 for different curvature radius .",
    "we do not include the cosmic variance .",

    "when @xmath291 , both antipodal points on the last scattering surface are close to the equator so that the angular correlation function in opposite directions is expected to be higher .",
    "the case in which @xmath292 is even more intricate because the geodesics are warping around the universe more than once .",
    "such features are general to all spherical spaces , but the higher the order of the group , the larger the minimal curvature radius to get a topological signal . since the size of the manifold decreases with the order of the group",
    ", there will always exist potentially detectable topologies even for spaces very close to flatness .",
    "note also that in the case of the projective space , @xmath293 which can be understood if one remembers that there is no breaking of global isotropy and homogeneity for the projective plane .",
    "this is the only exception for which one can have a non - trivial topology and no preferred direction .",
