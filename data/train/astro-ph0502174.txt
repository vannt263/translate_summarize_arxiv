    "this information resides in the spatial fluctuations of the total intensity and polarization of the cmbr .",
    "the past decade has seen the emergence of low noise detector technologies that are propelling us into an new era of precision measurements of the characteristics of the cmbr .",

    "the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) is one of several experiments that have used the technique of radio interferometry to measure the spatial power spectrum of these fluctuations . besides cbi , and its sister instrument , the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) ,",
    "recent experiments have employed a variety of methods to achieve sensitivities that approach cosmologically important levels : polar @xcite , saskatoon @xcite , pique @xcite , capmap @xcite , and atca @xcite .",
    "the cbi performed preliminary polarization observations in 2000 , and the results of this work are reported here .",
    "this initial set of observations demonstrated the cbi s polarization capabilities @xcite , and , on the basis of the success of this work , the telescope has been upgraded and dedicated to polarization observations since september 2002 ; the detections that resulted from these observations are presented in a recent paper by @xcite .",
    "other ongoing polarization experiments include boomerang @xcite , maxipol @xcite , compass @xcite , quest @xcite , wmap @xcite , and planck @xcite , the latter two of which are all - sky satellite missions .",
    "the cosmic background imager is a 13-element interferometer that operates in the 26 - 36 ghz band @xcite .",
    "the array consists of 90-cm cassegrain antennas mounted on a single , fully steerable platform .",
    "the antenna platform employs the standard alt - az axes , as well as a rotational degree of freedom about the telescope optical axis ; this latter feature facilitates polarization observations .",
    "the platform allows a range of positions for the telescopes , permitting observations of anisotropies on multipoles @xmath03500 ; this range encompasses the scales over which standard models predict that much of the power in total intensity and polarization fluctuations is to be found .",
    "the observations reported in this paper concentrate on the @xmath12 region , to which the cbi is particularly well - matched .",
    "the cbi employs single - mode circularly polarized receivers . in these initial pioneering polarization observations with",
    "the cbi the main focus was to determine the suitability of the instrument for polarization studies and to understand the primary sources of systematic error . to implement a polarization detection effort in parallel with the intensity observations that constituted the cbi s primary mission , we configured 12 receivers for _ lcp _ and one receiver for _ rcp _ ; the resulting array consisted of 66 total intensity ( _ ll _ ) and 12 cross - polarized ( _ lr _ ) baselines , all spanning @xmath13 .",
    "each receiver has a quarter - wave plate that determines its polarization .",
    "the cbi was configured for polarization observations from january to october 2000 , at which point the single _ lcp _ antenna was converted back to _",

    "the interplay between the kernal of the fourier transform and the primary beam determines the range of angular scales to which the baseline is sensitive ; for an observation at wavelength @xmath22 on a baseline of length @xmath23 , the synthesized beam @xmath24 determines the resolution , while the primary beam , for which @xmath25 , sets the field of view .",

    "the cbi directly measures @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "the cbi antenna elements are cassegrain dishes .",
    "good polarization performance favors a clear aperture , but the cassegrain optics do not impair the performance because the secondary of each telescope is supported by polystyrene feedlegs that are transparent at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "nonetheless , the optics do introduce contamination into the cross - polarized visibilities . to reduce crosstalk ,",
    "the antennas are surrounded by cylindrical shields ; unpolarized blackbody emission from the ground is polarized upon scattering from the insides of the antenna shields to the antenna feeds .",
    "this spurious spillover signal dominates the cross - polarized visibilities on short baselines , but the lead - trail observing technique eliminates this contamination ( section 3 ) . to test for the presence of spurious off - axis polarization , we measured the instrumental polarization at the half - power points of the primary beam in the four cardinal directions .",
    "a @xmath33 test demonstrated that the instrumental polarization at the these points is consistent with that at the antenna boresight , showing that the instrumental polarization properties do not degrade rapidly as one moves off - axis .",

    "the amplitude of the instrumental polarization averages @xmath48 for all baselines and all channels and can approach 20% .",
    "the receiver was modeled to understand the source of the leakage .",
    "the instrumental polarization is dominated by bandpass errors in the quarter - wave plates ; at the edges of the @xmath49 fractional band , the insertion phase of the quarter - wave plates departs from @xmath50 by several percent . in addition",
    ", assembly errors can cause the plate orientation to depart from the ideal 45@xmath11 with respect to the rectangular guide that follows it . a receiver model that incorporates these errors shows excellent agreement with the measured leakage ( figure  [ figure : plot_leakage_model-1 ] ) .",
    "the modeled receiver characteristics that give rise to @xmath51 are stable , so we infer that the measured leakage is stable as well .",
    "high signal - to - noise - ratio measurements of the leakage at regular intervals demonstrated that it remained stable over timescales spanning many months .",
    "the polarization data were calibrated with observations of extragalactic radio source 3c279 and the supernova remnant taurus a ( the crab nebula ) .",
    "3c279 , a bright extragalactic radio source , served as the primary polarization calibrator . with @xmath52 jy and @xmath53 at 31 ghz ( where @xmath54 ) , and no significant extended emission on cbi scales , 3c279 permits quick calibration observations .",
    "3c279 is variable , however , so it was monitored at monthly intervals throughout the polarization campaign with the nrao very large array at 22.46 ghz and 43.34 ghz .",
    "3c279 showed some activity during the january - may period ; at 22.46 ghz , its fractional polarization changed by @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , while its position angle rotated by 10@xmath11 during the same period .",
    "these changes were approximately linear at 22.46 ghz and occasionally discontinuous at 43.34 ghz .",
    "although the vla observations yield @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , we transferred only the fractional polarization _",
    "m _ and the position angle @xmath60 ( where 2@xmath61 ) to the cbi .",
    "this choice permits us to use daily measurements of 3c279 s total intensity with the cbi to set the flux density scale for the polarization observations .",
    "the absolute uncertainty of the total intensity calibration is 4% .",
    "we required two interpolations to apply the vla values for @xmath62 and @xmath60 to the cbi observations .",
    "the first interpolation transfers @xmath62 and @xmath60 from the two vla channels to the 26 - 36 ghz band . measurements of the total intensity of 3c279 in the ten cbi bands show that the total intensity is well characterized by a power law , and in light of this uniform behavior we made a simple linear fit to both @xmath62 and @xmath60 .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on this fit is typically less than @xmath63 in amplitude and 3@xmath11 in position angle . the second interpolation transfers _ m _ and @xmath60 from the dates of the vla observations to the intervening cbi observations .",
    "again , a linear interpolation was used . while the statistical uncertainty in this interpolation is generally small ( @xmath64 in amplitude and 3@xmath11 in position angle ) and trivial to compute , the systematic uncertainty is harder to estimate , particularly for the 43.34 ghz data ; the changes in _ m _ and @xmath60 between vla observations at 43.34 ghz in one interval are quite high ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , although only @xmath67 of the cmbr data were taken during this interval .",
    "regular measurements of the total intensity of 3c279 with the cbi show that it does not undergo excursions beyond those seen in the vla data , however , so we assume that the temporal variations in the polarization characteristics do not exceed those in the vla data . the measurement uncertainties in the vla data",
    "are typically 3% , so the uncertainties in the interpolated vla data can be as high as 8% .",
    "3c279 was observed nearly every night at a pair of deck positions separated by 90@xmath11 ; each observation lasted 5@xmath68 and was accompanied by a trailing field to measure contamination from ground spillover ( section 3 ) .",
    "the total uncertainty in the 3c279 calibration is typically 9% , of which 8% arises from the uncertainty in the vla data , 3% results from the uncertainty in the cbi @xmath31 observations , and 4% arises from the flux scale , which is set by the uncertainty in the cbi s @xmath43 calibration .",
    "tau a served as the polarization calibrator for nearly 40% of the polarization data .",
    "tau a is marginally resolved by the cbi , so we required a simple model for its morphology .",
    "there are no published data on tau a s polarized emission at 31 ghz , so we transferred the calibration on 3c279obtained directly from a nearly contemporaneous vla observation  to the tau a observations and derived a model .",
    "our tau a model consists of single elliptical gaussian components for each of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ; these model components are shown in table  [ table : taua_models ] , and this simple model is applicable over ranges of @xmath69500 and the 26 - 36 ghz band .",
    "the spectral indices for the two polarized components were constrained to be that of the total intensity : @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "we performed a number of supporting observations to assess the accuracy of the polarization calibration .",
    "we included 3c273 in the vla monitoring campaign , and observations of 3c273 with the cbi provide a test of the internal consistency of the polarization calibration .",
    "3c273 is a @xmath72 jy , @xmath73 polarized source at centimeter wavelengths , and the polarization we recover from cbi observations of 3c273 is consistent with the vla observations within the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the calibration .",
    "cross - checks on observations of 3c279 provide estimates of the uncertainty on the calibration with the tau a model in table  [ table : taua_models ] ; using tau a as a calibrator , we recover @xmath62 and @xmath60 for 3c279 to within @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "we regard these values as the uncertainties on the polarization calibration .",
    "the data presented here were obtained from deep observations of two fields , the 08@xmath76 field ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , and the 20@xmath76 field ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) ; measurements of total intensity fluctuations in these fields have been reported by @xcite .",
    "these fields are a subset of a group of four fields spaced at equal intervals in right ascension constrains the time on source to @xmath81 per day . ] that were selected for minimum contamination from diffuse galactic emission .",
    "both fields are at galactic latitudes greater than 24@xmath11 .",
    "each field is the size of a single beam , or @xmath82 fwhm at the band center ( section 2 ) .",
    "simple extrapolations from haslam 408 mhz maps suggested that for both fields , the polarization fluctuations from synchrotron emission at 1 cm on cbi scales would be smaller than the cmbr polarization fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the observations presented in this paper were obtained between january and october 2000 .",
    "the 08@xmath76 field was observed from january through the end of may , and the 20@xmath76 field was observed from august through the end of october , at which point the array was dedicated to total intensity observations until september 2002 .",
    "this work encompassed 99 nights of observations : 44 nights on the 08@xmath76 field and 55 nights on the 20@xmath76 field , which yielded 130@xmath76 and 148@xmath76 of data , respectively .",
    "the 08@xmath76 field observations spanned two array configurations , while the 20@xmath76 field was observed with a third .",
    "the weather at the chajnantor site was generally generally excellent when observations were not precluded by snow storms , and less than 1% of the data were flagged .",
    "the observing strategy was guided by several considerations .",
    "the visibilities measured on the short baselines are contaminated by ground spillover , so we observed fields in pairs separated by 8@xmath68 in right ascension and differenced the pairs offline to reject the common spillover contribution @xcite . to within the uncertainties of the visibilities ,",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath31 visibilities show no evidence of spillover after differencing .",
    "the observations were performed at night and when the moon was greater than 60@xmath11 from the fields .",
    "each lead / trail pair was tracked in constant parallactic angle , and , after each pair , the deck position was advanced by either 20@xmath11 or 30@xmath11 .",
    "each 8@xmath68 scan consists of @xmath83 8.4@xmath84 integrations ; @xmath85 of each scan is lost to calibrations and slews .",
    "we performed a number of consistency tests on the cmbr data prior to the likelihood analysis .",
    "we first applied a jackknife test to assess the accuracy of the noise estimates .",
    "the visibility uncertainty for each @xmath86 scan was estimated from the scatter in the @xmath83 integrations in the scan .",
    "for the jackknife test , the real and imaginary visibilities were sorted into two interleaved sets corresponding to alternating dates , and at each @xmath32 point , each set was averaged over time .",
    "the two sets were the differenced on a point - by - point basis in the @xmath32 plane .",
    "we are most concerned about effects on the shortest baselines , for which we expect the greatest signal , and conversely , for which the spillover contamination is greatest . to that end , for the 08@xmath76 field we computed @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( probability - to - exceed = 30% ) for the real components , and @xmath89 ( p.t.e .",
    "= 3% ) for the imaginaries .",
    "similarly , for the 20@xmath76 field visibilities ( @xmath90 ) , we find @xmath91 ( real ) and @xmath92 ( imaginary ) , both of which are consistent with unity .",
    "we were also concerned that systematic errors in the polarization of the calibrator sources  particularly the tau a model  would give rise to errors in the calibration of the cmbr data .",
    "since @xmath93 , we used the visibility uncertainties as a proxy for the amplitude component of the @xmath31 gain calibration ; we averaged the @xmath31 visibility uncertainties for the cmbr data and compared them to those for @xmath43 , the gain calibration of which we believe to be accurate to @xmath94 .",
    "after accounting for a slight ( 4% ) excess in system noise for rx12the orthogonally polarized antenna that is common to all @xmath31 visibilities  we find that @xmath95 to within 10% , which is consistent with the results of the calibration cross - checks discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "we observed several polarized sources to assess the polarization performance of the cbi .",
    "centaurus a ( ngc 5128 ) is a nearby active galaxy that exhibits a rich variety of polarized structure over a range of angular scales at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "w44 has several janskies of polarized emission at 1 cm , and its size of @xmath96 is comparable to the primary beam of the cbi .",
    "we discuss these examples here .",
    "we observed centaurus a for 6.8@xmath76 with the cbi .",

    "the image is centered on the northern end of the double inner lobe , at which point the total intensity peaks at 20.1 jy , the fractional polarization reaches 12% , and the position angle is @xmath97 . while the total intensity of the southern lobe resembles that of the northern lobe  it peaks at 18.7 jy / beam  the polarization characteristics of the southern lobe are strikingly different ; the fractional polarization reaches 3.6% at the total intensity peak , at which point the pa @xmath98 .",

    "the position angle across the two inner lobes is @xmath99 , and it wraps around around to @xmath100 along the southern slope of the southern inner lobe .",

    "first , the @xmath83 8.4@xmath84 integrations in each 8@xmath68 scan were averaged to form a single visibility for that scan .",
    "the uncertainty for the scan - averaged visibility was computed from the scatter in the constituent visibilities .",
    "this procedure introduces a downward bias in the noise , so the elements of the noise covariance matrix * n * were scaled upward by 6% to correct for this bias @xcite .",
    "next , all of the visibilities for all nights were averaged by @xmath32 point , and finally , to truncate the size of the covariance matrix , the visibilities were averaged by band .",
    "the band average has the potential to bias the best - fit bandpowers , so we analyzed two simulated sets of low signal - to - noise data , one with a single @xmath116 ghz band centered at the middle of the cbi band , and another with the entire @xmath117 ghz band averaged to a single @xmath116 ghz band that was centered at the same frequency as the first set .",

    "we are therefore confident that the bandpowers reported in this work are not contaminated by errors in the leakage correction by more than this level .",
    "since we report upper limits in this paper , our primary concern is that systematic calibration errors do not cause us to _ underestimate _ these limits .",
    "the simulations demonstrated that of the four types of calibration errors ( @xmath121 , @xmath119 , @xmath123 , and @xmath122 ) , only a systematic error in the gain amplitude can bias the limits downward , and , as noted previously , a variety of cross - checks demonstrated that the error on @xmath121 is 10% .",

    ".    these upper limits are consistent with the rapidly burgeoning body of cmbr polarization data .",
    "the limit at @xmath132 is consistent with limits in the same region from dasi and cbi .",
    "the limits for the higher @xmath40 bins are consistent with predictions for @xmath133 for generally accepted families of models .",
    "the limits also provide constraints on polarized emission from galactic synchrotron emission and polarized point sources in these regions and on these scales .",
    "this poineering polarization effort with the cbi provided great confidence in the polarization capabilities of the instrument , and it was a central consideration in our decision to upgrade the cbi for a dedicated polarization program .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge cbi project scientist steve padin for his contributions as chief architect of the instrument .",
    "we thank brian mason and patricia udomprasert for their help with the observations .",
