    "while mathematics and juggling have existed independently for thousands of years , it has only been in the last thirty years that the mathematics of juggling has become a subject in its own right ( for a general introduction see polster @xcite ) .",
    "several different approaches for describing juggling patterns have been used .",
    "the best - known method is siteswap which gives information what to do with the ball that is in your hand at the given moment , in particular how `` high '' you should throw the ball ( see @xcite ) . for theoretical purposes",
    "a more useful method is to describe patterns by the use of cards .",
    "this was first introduced in the work of ehrenborg and readdy @xcite , and modified by butler , chung , cummings and graham @xcite .",
    "these cards work by focusing on looking at the _ relative order _ of when the balls will land should we stop juggling at a given moment .",
    "every throw then has the effect of changing the relative ordering of the balls .",
    "but we can only effect the order of a ball that is thrown ; the remaining balls will still have the remaining relative order to each other . as a consequence if there are @xmath0 balls there are @xmath1 different things which can happen .",
    "namely , we do nt throw a ball ( the `` @xmath2 '' ) or we throw a ball so that it will land in some order relative to the other @xmath3 balls ( which can be done in @xmath0 ways ) .",
    "the four different cards for the case @xmath4 are shown in figure  [ fig : basiccards ] ( in all drawings of cards the circle at the bottom indicates the hand which either does not catch the ball at that `` beat '' or catches and throws effecting the relative ordering of the ball(s ) ; we will always think of time moving from left to right ) .",
    "the advantage of working with cards is that the cards can work independently of each other , that is the choice of card to use at a given time is not dependent on the preceding choice of cards . in siteswap",
    "the opposite is true in that you must know all preceding throws to determine which throws are possible .    given a set of these @xmath5 cards for a given @xmath0 we can repeat these periodically to form a pattern .",
    "moreover , every possible siteswap with period @xmath5 and at most @xmath1 balls will occur as a unique combination of these cards ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the number of different siteswap sequences of period @xmath5 for exactly @xmath0 balls is given by @xmath6 if we want to find all of the juggling patterns of _ minimal _ period @xmath5 and using exactly @xmath0 balls we can then use mbius inversion and divide out by the period to get @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mbius function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( we will revisit this with more detail in section  [ sec : counts ] . )    for as long as there has been interest in the mathematics of juggling there has been interest in extending results to multiplex juggling ( where more than one ball is allowed to be caught at a time ) . in ehronborg and readdy",
    "they produced possible cards for multiplex juggling which were a natural generalization .",
    "namely multiple balls could come down at a given time and would then be redistributed appropriately . while these cards can describe every juggling pattern there is the problem that uniqueness is lost ( see figure  [ fig : nonunique ] for an example of two consecutive cards describing the same pattern but using different cards ) .",
    "so using these cards to count multiplex juggling patterns is not straight - forward .",
    "one approach is to distinguish the balls which come down .",
    "this is what was done in butler , chung , cummings and graham @xcite , an example of such a card is shown in figure  [ fig : separate ] .",
    "this avoids ambiguity that might arise but does not accurately reflect multiplex juggling in practice , but rather reflects passing patterns with multiple jugglers involved each juggler catching one ball ( in particular the different points that come down correspond to the different jugglers ) .    in this paper",
    "we will propose a new type of card which can be used for multiplex juggling .",
    "it solves the ambiguity problem of ehronbrog and readdy and also solves the modeling problem of butler , chung , cummings and graham .",
    "however it does come at the mild cost of having a card being dependent on the _ previous _ card which came before . in section  [ sec : cards ] we will introduce these cards , and in section  [ sec : graph ] we show how to use matrices associated with a weighted graph to count the number of periodic patterns of length @xmath5 .",
    "we then count the number of siteswap sequences and the number of juggling patterns in section  [ sec : properties ] and section  [ sec : counts ] . in section  [ sec : hand ]",
    "we will consider what happens when we limit the number of balls which can be thrown .",
    "we will give some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , including a discussion of counting crossing numbers .",
    "most of the enumeration techniques here are fairly standard , it is their application to counting juggling patterns that is new .",
    "we will also see that the objects generated in the process of deriving our count seem to have independent combinatorial interest .",
    "moreover , while our main goal has been to enumerate juggling patterns , the cards themselves might be useful for the exploration of other combinatorial aspects of juggling .    finally , we note that while there has some been interest in counting multiplex juggling patterns , prior to this paper there has been little success .",
    "butler and graham @xcite made the most progress but their focus was on counting closed walks in a state graph and were not able to efficiently enumerate all juggling patterns .",
    "the way that cards describe juggling patterns is through understanding the relative order of their landing times .",
    "the ambiguity that appeared in figure  [ fig : nonunique ] comes from the fact that two balls are landing _ together _ but still being kept _ separate _ in the ordering . since they are separate we could order them in two ways but that does not effect the pattern .",
    "this suggests the following simple fix : tracks no longer represent individual balls , but rather groups of balls which will land together .",
    "so now either the `` lowest '' group does nt land , or the lowest group lands and the balls get thrown so that they are placed in new track(s ) or added to the existing tracks .    before each throw",
    "we will have an ordered partition of the number of balls @xmath0 on the left , i.e. , @xmath9 which corresponds to the statement that were we to stop juggling we would first have @xmath10 balls land at some point ; then @xmath11 balls land some time later ; and so on until finally @xmath12 balls land at the end .",
    "( note that we do not claim that they will land one right after the other ; cards are keeping track of relative ordering of when things land and not the absolute times that they will land . ) similarly after each throw we will have another ordered partition of @xmath0 on the right , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "( the number of our parts in our two partitions need not be the same but we must have @xmath14 . ) if anything lands then the card in the middle indicates how the @xmath10 balls get redistributed .",
    "examples of these cards are shown in figure  [ fig : multicards ] where the first card corresponds to going from @xmath15 back to @xmath15 and the second corresponds to going from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "c@c & +    ( 0,0 ) rectangle ( 1,1 ) ( 0,1 ) rectangle ( 1,2 ) ; ( 0,2 ) rectangle ( 1,3 ) ( 0,1 ) rectangle ( 1,2 ) ( 0,0 ) rectangle ( 1,1 ) ( 1,0 ) rectangle ( 2,1 ) ;    &    ( 0,1 ) rectangle ( 1,2 ) ( 1,1 ) rectangle ( 2,2 ) ( 0,2 ) rectangle ( 1,3 ) ; ( 0,0 ) rectangle ( 1,1 ) ( 0,1 ) rectangle ( 1,2 ) ( 1,1 ) rectangle ( 2,2 ) ( 0,2 ) rectangle ( 1,3 ) ( 1,2 ) rectangle ( 2,3 ) ;    an ordered partition @xmath9 can be _ nontrivially embedded _ into an ordered partition @xmath13 if there exists indices @xmath18 so that @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "note that given two ordered partitions several nontrivial embeddings are possible .",
    "an ordered partition @xmath9 can be _ trivially embedded _ into an ordered partition @xmath13 if and only if @xmath21 .    for every nontrivial embedding of @xmath9 , a partition of @xmath0 , into @xmath13 , another partition of @xmath0",
    ", we have a card for multiplex juggling where a throw occurred . as an example in figure  [ fig : multicards ]",
    "we have also marked underneath how @xmath9 embeds into @xmath13 by drawing the partition of @xmath13 arranged from @xmath22 on the bottom to @xmath23 on the top and shading where @xmath24 sits inside the partition .",
    "trivial embeddings , i.e. , @xmath25 , correspond to no throws .",
    "all possible cards ( and corresponding embeddings of partition ) for multiplex juggling when @xmath4 are shown in figure  [ fig:3ballcards ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note that we can ask similar questions about the sum of the entries in @xmath26 as well as the row and column sums as we did with @xmath27 ( i.e. , lemma  [ lem : right ] , lemma  [ lem : left ] and theorem  [ thm : cardrecurse ] ) .",
    "however the counts are less clear , and have not appeared in the oeis . as an example if we count the total number of cards when @xmath28 we get the following numbers , starting with @xmath29 : @xmath30 these numbers do appear to satisfy a relatively simple relationship . in particular through @xmath31",
    "these numbers agree with the following conjecture .",
    "let @xmath32 be the number of cards for multiplex juggling with @xmath0 balls and where each track has capacity at most @xmath33",
    ". then @xmath34",
    "by modifying the cards used for juggling , namely allowing groups of balls to be grouped together , we have found a method that works for enumerating multiplex juggling patterns .",
    "there are still a few questions that remain , particularly in understanding what happens when we limit the number of balls that can be caught at any given time .",
    "ehronborg and readdy @xcite introduced cards for juggling and used them to study a @xmath35-analog of juggling by counting crossings .",
    "it is easy to count crossings on each card and then one simply adds up the crossings over all cards used to count the crossings of the pattern .",
    "we note that the matrices used here can be easily adapted to this situation .",
    "namely for each card we count crossings ( making sure to count multiplicity when balls move in groups ) , and then weight the card ( and hence edge in the graph ) by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of crossings .",
    "finally we can form matrices @xmath38 where we add up the weights of cards connecting ordered partitions . as an example we have @xmath39 we note that theorem  [ thm : siteswapcount ] and theorem  [ thm : capacity ] can be easily modified to count the number of juggling patterns with minimal period based on the number of crossings .",
    "an applied mathematical juggler might also want to add the constraint that whenever multiple balls are thrown that no two balls get thrown to the same height .",
    "our method can be readily adopted to this situation by simply removing any card which has two balls moved to the same track , which leads to modified graphs @xmath40 , and also modified matrices , @xmath41 .",
    "for example we have @xmath42    the matrices @xmath43 might also have independent interest .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that for @xmath44 that @xmath45 is a principal submatrix of @xmath46 .",
    "this seems to continue for at least the first few cases .",
    "does this containment continue ?",
    "note that this also seems to indicate a preferred ordering of the ordered partitions if we want to have ( 1 ) containment of the previous matrix in the upper left block and ( 2 ) an upper triangular matrix in the lower left block .",
    "what is this ordering ?",
    "things get even more interesting when we consider the characteristic polynomial of @xmath43 .",
    "if we let @xmath47 , then we have the following .",
    "@xmath48 where the polynomials @xmath49 are given by the following .",
    "@xmath50      *",
    "the sequence of the exponents of @xmath49 in the @xmath51 seem to follow @xmath52 this appears to be the sequence a178841 in the oeis @xcite which counts the number of pure inverting compositions of @xmath5 . *",
    "the degree of the polynomials @xmath49 follow @xmath53 this appears to be the sequence a000041 in the oeis @xcite which counts the number of unordered partitions of @xmath5 . *",
    "the second coefficients of the polynomials @xmath49 follow @xmath54 this appears to be the sequence a000712 in the oeis @xcite which counts the number of unordered partitions of @xmath5 into parts of @xmath33 kinds .",
    "we have no explanations for any of these phenomenon , but given the nature of how the matrix is formed believe this is more than coincedence .",
    "we look forward to more research being done into these cards and matrices ."
