    "semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) , first proposed by esaki and tsu in 1970 @xcite , are layered structures composed of regularly spaced quantum wells ( qws ) separated by barriers .",
    "a review of early research of sls was given , e.g. , by maan  @xcite and helm .",
    "@xcite    when doped by donors , the barriers provide electrons for two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron sheets inside the qws .",
    "as discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite the resulting electronic structure of the sl depends on the strength of the periodic potential as well as on the level of the doping , and can range from a quasi - three - dimensional ( 3d ) system to a nearly 2d system of independent layers of 2d electron gas in each qw .    for strong potential , usually provided by thick and high barriers , the tunnel - coupling of electron layers , associated with overlap of wave functions from neighboring wells , is negligible and sl minibands reduces to almost discrete energy levels",
    ". moreover , in the narrow wells , the minibands are well separated and usually only one miniband is occupied .",
    "then the electron system can be considered as 2d , and the fermi surface ( fs ) is cylindrical in shape .    with decreasing",
    "the barrier thickness tunneling of electrons becomes increasingly important , manifesting itself in the broadening of minibands .",
    "the fs becomes the corrugated cylinder if the fermi energy @xmath3 is above the miniband top , or closed semielliptical fermi ovals ( each fully contained within the first brillouin zone ) for the fermi energy below the miniband top .",
    "the latter electronic structure corresponds to the anisotropic 3d electron gas .",
    "the development of the fs topology with increasing tunnel - coupling between qws is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fs_topology ] .",
    "we call the change of the fs from an open corrugated cylinder towards closed ovals the 2d  @xmath4  3d transition .",
    "( color online ) the scheme of a variety of sl fermi surfaces . from the left to the right : a cylinder is related to @xmath3 lying well above the narrow sl miniband top ( strictly 2d behavior ) ; a corrugated cylinder corresponds to @xmath3 lying above the sl miniband top ( 2d behavior ) ; touching fss arise when @xmath3 lies at the top of the sl miniband and define the point of the 2d  @xmath4  3d transition ; separated ovals occur when @xmath3 lies below the sl miniband top ( strictly 3d behavior ) . ]    the sl fermi surface topology can be determined experimentally by magnetotransport measurements in magnetic fields @xmath5 tilted with respect to the qw planes .",
    "@xcite the quasiclassical theory predicts that an electron is driven by the lorentz force around orbits , defined in @xmath6-space by intersections of the fs and planes perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetic field . in the case of closed orbits ,",
    "the electron motion is quantized into landau levels , that manifest themselves through shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations observable in the longitudinal magnetoresistance .    the onsager - lifshitz relation @xcite states that sdh oscillations are periodic in @xmath7 with the period determined by the extremal cross - sections of the fs .",
    "@xcite by tilting the sample , a number of cross - sections can be examined and the fs reconstructed .",
    "this is true only for closed fss . for corrugated cylinders ,",
    "open orbits appear for field orientations close to the qw planes , and the sdh oscillations are suppressed .",
    "an interesting case are sls with the fermi energy just below the top of the miniband .",
    "the fermi ovals nearly touch the brillouin zone boundaries and , therefore , the extremal closed orbits corresponding to the in - plane magnetic fields also nearly touch each other . if the magnetic field is strong enough , the onsager - lifshitz quantization scheme can be violated by the magnetic breakdown , and the closed orbits effectively interconnected to the open ones .",
    "in that case we can speak about _ magnetic - field_-induced 3d@xmath42d transition . at this point",
    "the quasiclassical description fails and the quantum - mechanical treatment becomes necessary .    the deviations from the standard @xmath7 periodicity due to the magnetic breakdown have been already reported in ref .  , for sdh oscillations corresponding to the landau levels with low indices , measured in strong tilted magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic - field - induced 3d@xmath42d transition was intentionally studied by jaschinski _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite our experimental investigation of this effect is described in ref .   and",
    "interpreted by the full quantum - mechanical theory developed in ref .  .",
    "in the present publication we concentrate on another possibility : the illumination - induced changes of the superlattice fs topology .",
    "the illumination of doped semiconductor structures at low temperatures leads to the persistent photoconductivity effect ( ppc ) and increases the concentration of free carriers .",
    "as the increase of the concentration means the increase of the fermi energy , one expects that it might be possible to change the fs topology from closed ovals to a corrugated cylinder .",
    "this paper reports on the experimental study demonstrating that the illumination of the sl sample can indeed change the electronic structure of the sl and induce a transition from a 3d to 2d state . to exclude the magnetic breakdown , we limit our experiments to lower magnetic fields , for which the quasiclassical interpretation of magnetotransport measurements is valid .",
    "the sample employed in our experiments is the mbe - grown sl ( 30 periods ) , which consists of 29 gaas qws of width @xmath8  nm , separated by @xmath9  nm wide al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barriers .",
    "this gives the period @xmath10 of the sl equal to @xmath11  nm .",
    "each barrier is composed of the central si - doped part @xmath12  nm thick , which is flanked by @xmath13  nm thick undoped spacer layers on both sides . the samples from the same wafer were used in our previous study of the magnetic - field - induced 3d@xmath42d transition @xcite in magnetic fields up to @xmath14  t.    the hall bar samples have been patterned by means of the optical lithography , equipped with evaporated augeni contact pads and adjusted to ceramic chip carriers .",
    "the width of their conducting channel was @xmath15  @xmath16 m , the length of the sample was @xmath17  @xmath16 m .",
    "the chip carrier with the sample has been attached to a rotation plate in a @xmath18he cryostat , that fitted the bore of a superconducting magnet providing magnetic fields from 0 to @xmath19  t , the range of fields for which the quasiclassical interpretation of sdh oscillation is reasonable .",
    "@xcite    the plate made it possible to rotate the sample to any angle between the perpendicular @xmath20 and in - plane @xmath21 field orientations .",
    "standard lock - in technique at @xmath22  hz has been employed to measure simultaneously both the longitudinal @xmath23 and hall @xmath24 resistances during sweeping the magnetic field up or down .",
    "all the data presented below were taken at the temperature of about @xmath25  k.    a red - light led was installed next to the sample holder to facilitate an `` in situ '' illumination of the cooled - down sample in order to enhance the electron concentration and induce the ppc .",
    "short current pulses ( @xmath26  msec ) were subsequently applied to the led and the decrease of the zero - field resistance of the sample due to the illumination was monitored .",
    "a few such pulses were sufficient to get the resistance saturation .",
    "all the curves reported below for the `` illuminated '' sample have been measured in this saturated state .",
    "it follows from the general consideration presented in the introduction that the energy spectrum of the sl can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the effective mass of electrons moving freely in the @xmath29 plane of the qws , and @xmath30 is the dispersion relation of the miniband which describes tunneling of electrons through the barriers .",
    "@xmath30 is a periodic function , @xmath31 .",
    "together with the knowledge of @xmath3 , eq .  ( [ 3d_dispersion ] ) determines the shape of the sl fermi surface .",
    "the aim of this publication is to determine the fs of the sl from measured periods of sdh oscillations in tilted magnetic fields .",
    "therefore we employ the simplest possible model of @xmath30 to minimize the number of fitting parameters describing the miniband structure .",
    "the natural choice is the tight - binding model in which @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the coupling constant , associated with the matrix element of the sl potential between the overlapping wave functions from neighboring wells , which determines the miniband width .",
    "the sl growth parameters such as the effective barrier thickness , the barrier height and the qw width are thus represented by this single constant @xcite , and the shape of the fs is described by three parameters @xmath33 , @xmath10 and @xmath3 .",
    "it will be shown in subsequent sections that this approximation of @xmath30 yields a reasonable agreement with experimental findings .",
    "the cosine approximation for a single sl miniband gives the following expressions for the electron concentration per layer : @xmath34,\\ ] ] for a closed fs and @xmath35 for an open fs .",
    "these expressions include the spin degeneracy . according to eqs .",
    "( [ n_closed])-([n_open ] ) , the knowledge of the electron concentration , which can be determined from the hall magnetoresistance data , allows the prediction of the fermi energy value @xmath3 .",
    "after application of an external magnetic field @xmath5 , the energy spectrum is converted to a set of landau levels .",
    "the orbits corresponding to extremal cross - section areas , @xmath36 , of the fs are most important . according to the onsager - lifshitz quantization rule @xcite , the expression @xmath37 determines a set of magnetic fields at which landau levels cross the fermi energy .",
    "we have chosen the geometry where a uniform magnetic field applied in the @xmath38 plane @xmath39 is tilted by an angle @xmath40 with respect to the growth axis @xmath41 , and its orientation varies between perpendicular @xmath42 and in - plane @xmath43 configurations .",
    "the relation between the period of sdh oscillations in reciprocal magnetic fields , @xmath44 , and @xmath36 can be written as @xmath45 with the energy spectrum given by eqs .",
    "( [ 3d_dispersion ] ) and ( [ miniband ] ) , the extremal cross - section area in tilted magnetic fields takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) @xmath48 is the point at which the plane perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field cuts the axis @xmath49 .",
    "two types of extremal cross - sections exist : @xmath50 for @xmath51 corresponds to a `` belly '' orbit and @xmath52 for @xmath53 to a `` neck '' orbit .",
    "a wide range of tilt angles @xmath40 makes it possible to determine the fs of the sample .    in strictly perpendicular magnetic fields ,",
    "the `` belly '' and `` neck '' extremal orbits become circular , with cross - section areas given by simple expressions @xmath54 for the closed fss , @xmath55 is always less than @xmath56 , and only `` belly '' orbits with areas @xmath50 occur .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ o - lq ] ) that in the perpendicular magnetic field the quantized energies corresponding to either the `` belly '' or ` neck' orbit cut the fermi energy at magnetic fields given by equations @xmath57 note that we use the energy scale with the origin in the middle of the sl miniband , i.e. , the miniband bottom lies at @xmath58 and its top at @xmath59 .",
    "experimental data collected for the sl before illumination are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] . due to quasi-3d nature of its electronic structure ,",
    "quantum hall plateaus are not distinguished on hall magnetoresistance curves @xmath60 .",
    "the spin unresolved sdh oscillations can be noticed on all @xmath61 curves , including those obtained in strictly in - plane magnetic fields .",

    "both curves became strongly nonlinear in the low - field region , indicating that except of the electrons corresponding to the `` belly '' orbits , new group of electrons close to the `` neck '' orbits appeared .",

    "we have measured low - temperature longitudinal and transversal magnetoresistance of the short - period sl with si - doped barriers in the as - grown state and after illumination .    in the as - grown state",
    ", the sl behaves as a 3d system , exhibiting a single period sdh oscillations for all orientations of the external magnetic field .",
    "this implies that the neighboring qws are strongly coupled and electrons forming an anisotropic 3d gas are present with nonzero probability not only in the qws but also inside the barriers .",
    "it is possible only if all shallow si donors are ionized and empty shallow levels lie in the thermodynamic equilibrium well above the fermi energy .",
    "thus the depleted layer is extended through the whole al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barrier and the fermi energy is not fixed in al@xmath0ga@xmath1as by the donor level as in the standard modulation - doped structures .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated after the sample illumination , which leads to the persistent photoconductivity and increases persistently the density of carriers .",
    "the origin of the ppc is attributed to ionization of deep si donor states in the al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barrier . as the original `` dark '' value of the concentration and the magnetoresistance",
    "can be recovered by heating the sample to temperatures above 100  k , the illuminated sample is in a reversible metastable state , separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the capture barrier which prevents the return of electrons back to ionized si donor states at low temperatures .    in spite of year - long extensive studies the nature of deep levels and",
    "the capture barrier is still a subject of discussions .",
    "the detailed discussion of the properties of deep donor levels is beyond the scope of this publication , the main alternative explanations of the ppc and the photoionization process can be found , e.g. , in refs .  .",
    "here we consider as important that the capture barrier is formed around the ionized donors inside the doped al@xmath0ga@xmath1as layer .",
    "it can be a combined effect of both the band - offset between al@xmath0ga@xmath1as and gaas and this capture barrier which leads to suppression of the inter - well coupling and consequently to the reduction of the miniband width .",
    "in conclusion , longitudinal and transversal magnetoresistances have been measured in tilted magnetic fields on the gaas / algaas sl sample .",
    "illumination of the sample enhances the electron concentration in the qws and makes the sdh oscillations more complicated .",
    "the results have been analyzed in terms of a simple tight - binding model .",
    "the effect of the illumination can be described as a 3d@xmath42d transition , where the fs of the system changes from closed ovals contained within the first brillouin zone to an open corrugated cylinder , characteristic for a system composed of weakly coupled 2d electron layers .",
    "the illumination thus not only enhances the electron concentration in the layers , but simultaneously suppresses the strength of the inter - layer coupling as indicated by the decrease of the sl miniband width .",
    "this rather surprising result can be qualitatively explained in terms of increasing the effective barrier height due to a photon - induced ionization of deep donor impurity levels within al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barriers .",
