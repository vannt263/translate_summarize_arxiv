    "in the last two years a lot of progress has been made in understanding the ideas of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the starting point of a long chain of developments marks the bmn duality  @xcite , which connects @xmath3 @xmath4 super yang - mills ( sym ) in the sector of operators with large @xmath5 charge @xmath6 and type iib string theory on the maximally supersymmetric plane - wave background  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath7 , here the worldsheet @xmath8-model reduces to a free theory in the light - cone gauge and thus , can easily be quantized  @xcite .",
    "moreover , string interactions can be treated in the context of light - cone string field theory  @xcite .",
    "+ the parameters of the two sides of the duality are linked via  @xcite denotes the curvature scale of the plane - wave geometry and @xmath9 is the light - cone momentum . ] @xmath10 and therefore free string theory corresponds to the planar ( @xmath11 ) sector , while string interactions are identified with non - planar , interacting gauge theory .",
    "this statement has been subject to a wide range of tests based on the key relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the light - cone energy of string states and @xmath14 denotes the conformal dimension of the dual sym - operators . in particular for the planar case ,",
    "@xmath13 could explicitly be verified for so - called two - impurity operators ( i.e. two stringy excitations ) up to two loops  @xcite ; for all - loop arguments see  @xcite .",
    "the extension to the interacting part proved to be much more involved . on the field theory side ,",
    "the anomalous dimension of two - impurity operators is known up to @xmath15  @xcite @xmath16 \\,,\\ ] ] whereas in light - cone sft only the leading order energy shift has been computed  @xcite . over and above ,",
    "matrix elements of @xmath17 and the dilatation operator @xmath18 as well as decay widths of one - string states and single - trace operators have been successfully compared to leading order , see e.g.  @xcite . for more details",
    "we refer to the reviews  @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ it was subsequently realized , that the bmn correspondence can be generalized in essentially two directions : curvature corrections to the plane - wave background can be taken into account  @xcite having their counterpart in @xmath19 corrections of planar bmn gauge theory  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a completely new field was established by considering semiclassical string states in @xmath7  @xcite and the insight that the planar spectrum of sym operators is governed by an integrable hamiltonian ( long - range ) spin chain  @xcite , leading to a vast class of tests , see the review  @xcite and references therein .",
    "both cases show perfect agreement up to two loops  @xcite , see also  @xcite , but  despite of this tremendous progress ",
    "several open questions and puzzles gradually emerged at three loops : in the latter approach , string and gauge theory continue to exhibit qualitatively similar structures but start to differ in detail  @xcite .",
    "somewhat more disturbing results have been found in  @xcite : degeneracies present in the gauge theory and crucial for integrability  @xcite are lifted in the near plane - wave background .",
    "+ these recent developments raise the question whether disagreements do already occur in the bmn duality itself , namely in the non - planar , interacting sector .",
    "as was pointed out in  @xcite , certain matrix elements of @xmath17 and @xmath18 seem to mismatch starting at @xmath20 .",
    "this however need not necessarily imply that physical quantities show disagreement as well and deserves a more careful investigation , which we initiate in the present paper .",
    "eventually one would like to compute independently the energy of states with two ( stringy ) excitations on the string theory side and hopefully reproduce .",
    "+ therefore , in section 2 , we briefly introduce some well - known facts about the free theory and explicitly construct the supermultiplet for states with two stringy excitations .",
    "especially we find that states consisting of two fermionic / bosonic oscillators in general mix with each other .",
    "+ the evaluation of the energy shift @xmath21 demands the knowledge of cubic and quartic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we review ( section 3 ) the formulation of the three - string vertex restricted by the superalgebra at order @xmath22 and comment on further constraints on the quartic interaction .",
    "in particular , we notice that a term induced by the second order dynamical supercharges can not a priori be excluded .",
    "+ it is a known fact , that all members of a supermultiplet receive the same energy corrections .",
    "furthermore ( section 4 ) , one can show by using the states in the supermultiplet , degenerate perturbation theory becomes redundant .",
    "note , that both statements are only valid when including impurity - conserving and -non - conserving intermediate states .",
    "here , we calculate as a first step the complete perturbative ( in @xmath23 ) impurity - conserving contribution for one particular representation .",
    "quite surprisingly our result disagrees with that given in the literature  @xcite and also fails to reproduce the gauge theory prediction at two loops .",
    "above all as a qualitative difference to gauge theory the series features not only integer , but also half - integer powers of @xmath0 .",
    "it seems to be apparent that this truncated analysis does not reveal the whole story .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "in this section , we introduce the free theory and its symmetries and analyze the underlying supermultiplet structure .",
    "type iib string theory on the plane - wave space - time can be quantized in light - cone gauge  @xcite resulting in the hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the light - cone momentum , the frequencies are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicates the number operator @xmath28 compared to  @xcite we performed a redefinition of the oscillator basis to have the standard level - matching condition ( cf .",

    "+ due to the effective harmonic oscillator potential of the background geometry , the theory possesses an essentially unique @xmath37 singlet ground state @xmath38 ( labeled by its light - cone momentum since @xmath39 is a central element of the plane - wave superalgebra ) defined by @xmath40 excited states are obtained by acting with the creation oscillators on @xmath38 subject to the level - matching condition and can be organized into multiplets of the plane - wave superalgebra .",
    "its bosonic generators are @xmath41 , @xmath39 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the angular momentum generators of the transverse @xmath37 @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while the 32 supersymmetries are generated by @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( both transforming as @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] ) and @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( transforming as @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "+ on a general eigenstate of @xmath53 in a given irreducible representation of @xmath37 the nontrivial action of generators is as follows : certain combinations of @xmath42 and @xmath54 add or remove a bosonic zero - mode excitation ; this raises or lowers the energy of the state by @xmath55 and is the discretized analog of giving a state transverse momentum .",
    "note , that @xmath42 is not a quantum number in the plane - wave space - time since it does not commute with @xmath41 . similarly @xmath47 and @xmath48 add or remove a fermionic zero - mode excitation .",
    "this is why not the energy but @xmath56 , which only counts the non - zero - mode ( ` stringy ' ) excitations , is a casimir of the superalgebra .",
    "finally , the most interesting generators are @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; these do not change the number of excitations , commute with @xmath41 and , therefore transform states of the same energy but different @xmath37 representations into each other .",

    "the highest weight state is the ground state @xmath38 annihilated by all @xmath49 , @xmath50 and , therefore , this multiplet is short and protected against quantum corrections through string interactions .",
    "in contrast to the supergravity multiplet , where the state of lowest energy is unique , for the two - impurity multiplet the states of lowest energy @xmath58 are those with two stringy oscillators , schematically @xmath59 all of these 256 states are linked to each other by acting with half of the dynamical supercharges on a highest weight state which we will explicitly determine below , see also  @xcite for the discussion in the case of the near plane - wave background .",
