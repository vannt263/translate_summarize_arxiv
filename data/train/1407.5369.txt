    "in a seminal work , haldane demonstrated that a magnetic field is not required to induce integer quantum hall states  @xcite . adding a complex hopping to the tight - binding hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice opens a gap at the dirac points of the electron band structure .",
    "this gap leads to a topologically nontrivial electronic state for a half - filled band , i.e. a chern insulator or quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) state .",
    "the key characteristic of this state is the appearance of chiral edge channels at the sample boundaries , in which current can flow along one direction only , implying dissipationless charge transport due to the absence of backscattering .",
    "this property makes qah states attractive for ultra - low - power consumption applications .",
    "one of the current challenges in condensed matter physics is to find ways of stabilizing a qah state at ambient temperature .",
    "many paths toward realization of the qah effect have been suggested , most of which are limited to graphenelike dirac systems .",
    "proposals include spin - orbit coupled magnetic semi - conductors  @xcite , spin - orbit coupled ad - atoms on graphene  @xcite , and spin - polarized qah states  @xcite .",
    "experimental signatures of qah have been detected  @xcite and advanced nanostructures such as `` molecular graphene ''  @xcite open the possibility of controlled manipulation of dirac fermions . a proposal based on doped magnetic topological insulator materials",
    "@xcite has led to the first robust observation of the qah state very recently  @xcite .",
    "another proposed scenario involves spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking due to electron - electron interactions at dirac points  @xcite .",
    "however , relatively large electron - electron coulomb interactions are required to induce chiral states due to the vanishing density of electron states .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism for robust , high temperature qah states has generated much interest  @xcite . in certain correlated multi - orbital compounds ,",
    "conduction electrons are coupled to localized magnetic moments ( spins ) at each lattice site .",
    "the spin may arise , for example , from @xmath0-electrons in transition - metal oxide materials  @xcite or @xmath1-electrons in lanthanide based materials  @xcite .",
    "qah states are possible if the spin ordering is _ noncoplanar _ , in which case the local berry curvature ( scalar spin chirality ) acts as an effective magnetic field on the orbital motion of the conduction electrons .",
    "this mechanism does not require band structures with dirac points .",
    "qah states may also arise from weak - coupling instabilities at quadratic band crossings  @xcite and nested fermi surfaces  @xcite .",
    "nonzero chirality implies broken time - reversal and spatial parity symmetries , a necessary ingredient for qah states .",
    "note that these discrete symmetries can be spontaneously broken at finite temperature in two - dimensions , even though the continuous @xmath2 spin rotational symmetry has to remain intact .",
    "in this paper we investigate the kondo - lattice model ( klm ) on the kagome lattice .",
    "the klm is the simplest model that captures the interplay between conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : klm ] for an illustration . because we are interested in cases where the spins of localized electrons develop a net magnetic moment below a certain temperature ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the model can be further simplified by assuming that the localized moments are classical variables , i.e. , that there is no kondo effect . in klm , conduction electrons interact with the localized spins through an on - site exchange coupling @xmath5 .",
    "this exchange corresponds to hund s coupling for the case of transition metal oxides and kondo coupling for the case of intermetallics .",
    "the magnetic ordering induced by this exchange coupling thus depends on the dispersion of the itinerant electrons at the relevant filling fractions .",
    "the kagome lattice has a rich band structure containing dirac points , quadratic fermi points , and perfectly nested fermi surfaces with van hove singularities .",
    "it is remarkable that a single model contains all of the above features , which have been studied individually in triangular  @xcite , honeycomb  @xcite , checkerboard  @xcite , cubic  @xcite , and pyrochlore lattices  @xcite .",
    "thus , the kagome klm is a good candidate to search for robust topologically non - trivial states .    to investigate the complex magnetic orderings of the kagome lattice , our approach includes group - theoretical symmetry analysis at the ordering wavevectors , variational fourier - space calculations , and large - scale unconstrained numerical simulations .",
    "all approaches agree in the small @xmath5 limit .",
    "our large - scale simulations are based on a recently developed method to simulate classical degrees of freedom interacting with fermions  @xcite , which enables the unbiased study of magnetic ordering at any @xmath5 .",
    "we have uncovered some surprising spin textures that would be very difficult to stabilize in local moment mott insulating systems . among them , there are several spin orderings appearing at different filling factors that lead to a spontaneous qah effect .",
    "this variety of magnetic phases opens a path towards the realization of the qah effect at ambient temperature .",
    "our results are also relevant for interacting electron systems without preformed local moments , such as hubbard - type models  @xcite .",
    "the kagome tight - binding model is expected to exhibit weak - coupling instabilities when the electron filling reaches the qbcp or the van hove singularities .",
    "consequently , an infinitesimal @xmath5 will immediately produce magnetic ordering . on the other hand ,",
    "since the dirac points are stable against weak perturbations , robust magnetic ordering can only be expected at intermediate electron - electron interactions . moreover ,",
    "the magnetic or spin - density - wave ordering in the interacting systems has to complete with other instabilities , particularly the superconductivity order  @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the second van hove singularity due to sublattice interference phenomenon  @xcite ; we will discuss its consequences in sec .",
    "[ filling2 ]     kondo - lattice model ( klm ) on the kagome lattice .",

    "[ fig : klm ] .",
    "after fourier transformation @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 .",
    "the hopping matrix is @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are primitive lattice vectors of the triangular bravais lattice , and @xmath36 .",
    "after diagonalizing this matrix , we obtain two dispersive bands @xmath37 and a flat band @xmath38 at the top of the dispersion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the kagome lattice electronic band structure [ fig .  [ fig : dispersion](a ) ] exhibits several special points , which we now present and discuss in more detail .",
    "first , there are two inequivalent dirac cones at the corners @xmath21 of the brillouin zone ( bz ) schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion](b ) .",
    "as these dirac points are the isolated crossing points of the two dispersive bands , the fermi surface shrinks to the two @xmath39points at filling fraction @xmath40 . in accordance with the standard theory of electronic berry phases ,",
    "these dirac fermi points are characterized by nonzero berry flux @xmath41  @xcite . in the case of the kagome lattice",
    ", it has been shown that gapping out a pair of dirac points can lead to topological phases such as spontaneous qah and quantum spin hall insulators  @xcite , in agreement with the general theory of gapped dirac fermions in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , the vanishing density of states ( dos ) renders the dirac fermi points robust against weakly repulsive electron - electron interactions . in general",
    ", a finite interaction stength is required to open a gap at @xmath40 and stabilize a topologically nontrivial phase  @xcite .",
    "another topologically nontrivial band - touching occurs at the @xmath42-point between the upper dispersive and flat bands . at filling fraction @xmath43 the fermi surface",
    "consists of a single point at @xmath44 with a quadratic dispersion in its vicinity : @xmath45 .",
    "this so - called quadratic band - crossing point ( qbcp ) is characterized by a @xmath46 berry phase . in momentum space ,",
    "the topological qbcp resembles a vortex with a @xmath47 winding number  @xcite .",
    "contrary to dirac points , quadratic fermi points are unstable against arbitrarily weak short - range interactions due to their finite dos  @xcite . the perturbed quadratic fermi point",
    "either splits into two fundamental dirac points or it is completely gapped out , giving rise to a topological insulator  @xcite .",
    "however , because the whole flat band @xmath48 is degenerate with the @xmath42 fermi point , finding the magnetic structure stabilized by @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - klm ] ) for @xmath50 is still a rather complicated problem .    a third distinct spectral feature is related to the two dispersive bands , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the dos of @xmath51 and @xmath52 contains a van hove singularity at fillings @xmath24 and @xmath8 , respectively . a logarithmically divergent dos at these filling fractions results from the three saddle points @xmath53 at the edges of the bz [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion](c ) ] . for just nn hopping , the fermi surface at these filling fractions is a regular hexagon inscribed within the bz , as shown in fig .",

    "remarkably , pairs of parallel edges of this fermi surface are perfectly nested by wavevectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the perfect fermi surface nesting combined with a divergent dos leads to a magnetic susceptibility of the conduction electrons that diverges as @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "consequently , the system is unstable against developing a triple-@xmath56 magnetic order even for small @xmath57 .",
    "our goal is to find the magnetic ground state of the klm for each of these special filling fractions and to establish the nature of the corresponding electronic states . in the process of uncovering the magnetic ordering at the special fillings mentioned above",
    ", we will also discuss specific fillings different from these three . a quadrupling of the unit cell as a consequence of finite @xmath58 ordering allows for commensurate fillings other than the van hove fillings @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic ordering and the corresponding electronic state at these fillings as well .      in a nave approach",
    "to monte carlo sampling of the classical spins , every trial update of the spin configuration requires diagonalization of a new single - particle electron matrix to determine the change in energy .",
    "direct diagonalization costs order @xmath63 numerical operations , so this simulation approach is limited to systems with @xmath64 spins ( e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "we require much larger scale systems to study weak - coupling instabilities .",
    "small systems obscure susceptibility divergences because of their larger momentum space discretization cut - off . for example , fermi surface nesting yields a divergent susceptibility that scales as @xmath65 , and stabilizing the desired triple-@xmath56 magnetic orders may require @xmath66 spins  @xcite . evidently , direct diagonalization at every monte carlo step is impractical .    to simulate the klm at large scales ,",
    "we employ two complementary numerical methods .",
    "first , we perform unconstrained , finite - temperature simulations with a recently developed langevin method , which we review below .",
    "second , we use a fourier - space variational method to verify and analyze the candidate orderings at zero temperature . in our variational approach ,",
    "we assume a known magnetic unit cell size and search for the lowest energy ordering among spin configurations within the extended unit cell  @xcite .",
    "for example , the most general triple-@xmath56 orderings have a quadrupled magnetic unit cell of 12 spins .",
    "the electronic part can then be solved by applying a fourier transformation . the total energy obtained by summing over states within",
    "the reduced bz is a function of the magnetic configuration in the extended unit cell .",
    "we use standard simulated annealing to find the minimum - energy configurations with constrained periodicity  @xcite .",
    "more details can be found in appendix  [ appendix1 ] .",
    "our langevin method enables high accuracy , unconstrained simulation of very large systems , and is orders of magnitude faster than previous monte carlo methods  @xcite .",
    "we approximate langevin forces using an extension of the kernel polynomial method ( kpm )  @xcite .",
    "kpm provides fast estimates of the density of electron states ( dos ) , @xmath67)$ ] , where @xmath68 are the electron energy levels , i.e. the eigenvalues of the single - particle electron matrix @xmath69 .",
    "kpm approximates the dos using a truncated series in chebyshev polynomials @xmath70 , @xmath71 the numerical factors @xmath72 associated with the jackson kernel  @xcite optimally damp gibbs oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the chebyshev moments are given by @xmath73 .",
    "for efficiency , we use the kpm stochastic approximation @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a random vector with elements that satisfy the ensemble average @xmath76 .",
    "we use the chebyshev recursion relation in the form @xmath77 to iteratively build the vectors @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the moment estimates @xmath79 may be evaluated at linear cost in the number of spins @xmath80 by using only sparse matrix - vector multiplications .",
    "kpm accuracy is controlled by the series truncation order @xmath53 and the number of random vectors @xmath81 over which we average .    the kpm dos allows estimation of the ( free ) energy @xmath82 of a spin configuration @xmath83 . after integrating out the electrons at fixed chemical potential @xmath84 and inverse temperature @xmath85",

    "@xmath83 we extend kpm to also estimate forces @xmath88 .",

    "indeed , _ all _ forces @xmath88 may be simultaneously estimated by a `` reverse '' recursion relation with a cost linear in @xmath80 that is equivalent to the cost of estimating @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "we apply our kpm based force estimates to sample spins according to overdamped langevin dynamics , @xmath90 where @xmath91 are uncorrelated gaussian random variables with unit variance , @xmath92 is the langevin time , and we use an implicit lagrange multiplier to constrain @xmath93 .",
    "accuracy is again controlled by two tunable parameters : the series truncation order @xmath53 and the fraction @xmath94 of langevin integration time per random vector .",
    "the cost to integrate one unit of langevin time scales as @xmath95 .",
    "kpm inaccuracies may be viewed as introducing an effective temperature .",
    "series truncation effectively smooths the fermi function on the scale @xmath96 , whereas stochastic errors in the force effectively increase the thermal noise an amount @xmath97 . to search for ground states ,",
    "we randomize the initial spin configuration and then integrate the langevin dynamics with @xmath98 .",
    "we perform most simulations with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) can be viewed as the overdamped limit of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation , our simulations also capture the physical emergence of mesoscale topological defects and their dynamics .",
    "indeed , we find different domain structures in the same magnetic ordering for different filling fractions at finite temperatures .",
    "this subtle difference can be attributed to the different types of effective long - range spin - spin interactions that are mediated by the conduction electrons .",
    "we start by considering the magnetic orderings for electron filling fractions right at the van hove singularities of the dos , i.e. the filling fractions @xmath102 and @xmath60 . as mentioned above",
    ", the fermi surface of the ideal nn kagome lattice tight - binding model is a regular hexagon inscribed within the hexagonal bz .",
    "the corners of the fermi surface hexagon are the three inequivalent @xmath53-points of the bz .",
    "these special points are the dominant source of the divergent susceptibility as they are the saddle points of the electron dispersion .",
    "the @xmath53-points are nested by three commensurate wavevectors @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which generically give rise to a quadrupled unit cell since these nesting wavevectors are half of the reciprocal lattice vectors . before we present the results of our numerical simulations",
    ", we will provide a symmetry - based perspective of general triple-@xmath56 magnetic orderings , with the purpose of gaining insight into the magnetic and electronic properties of such orderings .",
    "in addition , we will demonstrate how the magnetic ground states found in the numerical simulations may be understood analytically on the basis of symmetry constraints  @xcite .",
    "we then move on to discuss in detail the magnetic order parameters describing the spin textures obtained from our numerical minimizations for @xmath103 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "triple-@xmath56 magnetic ordering on the kagome lattice can be discussed from the perspective of lattice symmetries .",
    "this will shed light on the electronic properties of the conduction electrons in the presence of such ordering .",
    "furthermore , we will illustrate how triple-@xmath56 magnetic ground states can be derived systematically by imposing symmetry requirements on the most general form of the spin order parameter  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations then confirm that these are the correct requirements to impose .    as a consequence of the commensurability of the @xmath53-point wavevectors we have @xmath104 ( modulo reciprocal lattice vectors ) and hence @xmath105 .",
    "the most general spin state modulated by these @xmath106 vectors can be written as @xmath107 where every site on the kagome lattice is labeled by @xmath108 , @xmath109 denoting the sublattice and @xmath110 denoting the bravais lattice unit cell .",
    "the set @xmath111 describes nine vector order parameters , one for each sublattice and @xmath56-vector .    in the context of the klm with classical spin states",

    "these also correspond to the spin configurations in collinear sdw states .",
    "we take these three symmetric combinations and focus on the different ways of embedding the obtained @xmath137 in a vector order parameter , i.e. the different ways of combining them with @xmath138 .",
    "a fully collinear spin state would be given by @xmath139 for all sublattices @xmath109 , and nesting wavevectors @xmath106 .",
    "this fully collinear arrangement of spins does not change the symmetry of the electronic state , which is still @xmath115 , @xmath117 and @xmath116 , respectively . due to the fact that the collinear @xmath115 state uses only a single @xmath122 per kagome sublattice",
    ", it fulfills the requirement of uniform spin length , whereas the ( collinear ) @xmath140 states do not .",
    "we note that the @xmath115 state would be the kagome lattice version of the uniaxial spin density wave state reported in @xcite .",
    "these collinear spin states all manifestly break translational invariance as a consequence of ordering at finite @xmath122 momentum vectors .",
    "one can restore an effective translational invariance by choosing @xmath141 , i.e. single unit vector for each @xmath106 , while at the same time demanding @xmath142 for @xmath143 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : irrep](d ) ] .",
    "translational invariance is effectively preserved for these spin configurations , as the translations which appear to be broken by finite @xmath106 ordering can be combined with global @xmath144 rotations of the spins to leave the state invariant ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for each of the three scalar states",
    "there is such a corresponding translationally invariant spin state . because these spin states are translationally invariant",
    ", they clearly satisfy the constraint of uniform spin length .",
    "a key result of our numerical work , which we discuss below , is that these three triple-@xmath56 spin states are indeed the ground states ( modulo a global spin rotation ) at the different commensurate filling fractions .",
    "we summarize the symmetry constraints giving the three noncoplanar spin configurations as follows : the electronic state i ) transforms as a @xmath124 irreducible representation of @xmath121 , and ii ) is translationally invariant up to global spin rotation .",
    "knowing the symmetry properties of the triple-@xmath56 spin configurations puts us in a position to immediately deduce the symmetries of the electronic state .",
    "first , the effective translational invariance mandates a full double degeneracy of the spectrum . translating",
    "the spin configuration by one lattice vector and performing a global spin rotation by @xmath145 about the appropriate axis does not change the hamiltonian , but it does transform the wave function into an orthogonal one .",
    "hence , the electronic spectrum is manifestly doubly degenerate for all three states .    by associating a distinct orthogonal spin component @xmath146 to each of the three @xmath122 momenta [ fig .",
    "[ fig : irrep](d ) ] , the resulting triple-@xmath56 states have noncoplanar spin configurations .",
    "up to a global @xmath144 spin rotation , these magnetic states are invariant under the reflection operations of the @xmath121 group .",
    "specifically , one can show that such a rotation is improper , i.e. , it gives a minus sign when translated into an @xmath2 rotation on the electron spin .",
    "this changes the symmetry of the electronic state to @xmath147 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively , after multiplication by @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the electronic states corresponding to the three triple-@xmath56 spin ordered states transform as the representations @xmath147 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 of the hexagonal symmetry group @xmath121 .",
    "the noncoplanarity of the spins admits a discrete scalar order parameter characterizing the chirality of the structure .",
    "explicitly , a scalar chiral order parameter can be defined for each sublattice @xmath148 where @xmath149 refers to ordering vector @xmath58 . in general , the @xmath150 chiral order parameters of different sublattices are related to each other .",
    "more importantly , although the continuous spin @xmath2 symmetry can not be spontaneously broken in 2d , true long - range ordering of the discrete chirality is possible .",
    "consequently , one expects a finite temperature phase transition that breaks the @xmath150 symmetry .",
    "indeed , a similar transition is observed in the tetrahedral ordering transition in the triangular klm  @xcite .    in the rest of this section we will discuss the ground states observed in numerical simulations , which we find to be consistent with the predictions based upon symmetry analysis .",
    "we stress that our large - scale kpm - langevin numerical simulations make no _ a priori _ assumptions concerning the magnetic ordering .",
