    "low - dimensional systems , such as rods , beams and polymers , also feature interesting behaviors in the presence of spatial inhomogeneities in their properties . when these systems are excited externally , either by mechanical perturbations or by coupling to a heat bath , they exhibit non - trivial responses and fluctuations associated with the spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "thermal and entropic effects are known to play a major role in a broad range of soft matter and biophysics problems where polymers and biopolymers are considered  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the effect of spatial inhomogeneity on the fluctuations of polymers  @xcite .    to address this problem",
    "we study in this paper the mechanics and statistical thermodynamics of spatially inhomogeneous one - dimensional polymers where the inhomogeneity takes the form of an inclusion of finite length which is mechanically softer than the rest of the polymer .",
    "the polymer is assumed to be submerged in a solvent of a fixed temperature such that it undergoes overdamped equilibrium thermal fluctuations under certain constraints .",
    "there are many physical systems that might give rise to such a situation .",
    "for example , actin filaments in cells are known to significantly soften in regions where cofilin molecules bind to them  @xcite , so partially cofilin - decorated actin filaments are spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "other natural and man - made systems can exhibit similar spatial inhomogeneity  @xcite .    our discussion ,",
    "while motivated by these realistic and important examples , remains rather general and independent of the particular details of the underlying physical system .",
    "this is achieved by considering general hamiltonians in the small gradient approximation , i.e. generic quadratic hamiltonians ( energy functionals ) . in the context of torsional fluctuations of the polymer , the energy functional",
    "is quadratic in the gradient of the twist angle , while in the context of extensional fluctuations of the polymer the energy functional is quadratic in the gradient of the longitudinal displacement along the polymer .",
    "the resulting energy functional is the same in these two cases .    in the context of bending fluctuations of the polymer , the energy functional",
    "is quadratic in the the local curvature , which in itself is a second derivative of the out - of - plane deflection of the polymer in the small gradient approximation .",
    "this is nothing but the classical one - dimensional helfrich hamiltonian in the absence of surface tension  @xcite .",
    "as such , from a more theoretical perspective , we consider the classical example of massless , which in our case would correspond to an external potential . here",

    "a continuum approach is invoked and macroscopic variables of interest are assumed to vary slowly in space .",
    "one of our goals here is to understand to what extent the problem can be described by the continuum approach and when does it break down . to that aim , we solve the problem using both a continuum field theory and its discrete counterpart .",
    "we highlight the fundamental differences between the continuum and discrete spectra of eigenvalues and eigenmodes , and explore the implications of these differences in relation to two physically realistic fluctuation - induced forces .",
    "the first one is a fluctuation - induced force associated with free - energy variations with respect to the properties of the inclusion ( e.g.  formed by adsorbing molecules , in which case it is the fluctuation - induced contribution to the adsorbing molecules binding force ) , while the second is a fluctuation - induced force associated with free - energy variations with respect to an external geometric constraint ( e.g.  a confining wall ) .",

    "note that @xmath30 is defined differently for the two operators , cf .",
    ".          a crucial step in calculating the structure of the eigenmodes is specifying the internal boundary conditions ( bc ) at the discontinuity points @xmath62 .",
    "these , together with the external boundary conditions at @xmath34 , determine the amplitudes @xmath54 .",
    "it is important to stress that the external boundary conditions completely and uniquely specify the sturm - liouville problem .",
    "however , since we treat the problem separately for the different segments , we also need to specify the _ internal _ bc at the mechanical discontinuity points .",
    "that is , the internal bc are a result of our choice to divide the problem into 3 distinct segments . if @xmath7 were to change over a finite length - scale , then this division would not have been necessary ( nor possible ) and no internal bc would have been needed .",
    "such a calculation is carried out in the supplementary material  @xcite , though in this case it can not be carried out analytically .",
    "the form of the internal bc can be obtained either by taking the limit of an infinitely small variation length of @xmath7 , or equivalently , in the following manner .",

    "[ sec : comp ] .    before concluding this subsection ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the structure of @xmath142 , which has a neat physical interpretation .",

    "we note that the internal energy associated with the unconstrained free - energy , @xmath173 , trivially equals @xmath174 according to the equipartition theorem .",
    "consequently , @xmath175 in fact measures the deviation of the internal energy from the background thermal energy predicted by equipartition .    in the limit of large @xmath176",
    ", @xmath177 vanishes , as expected ( i.e. the polymer is essentially unconstrained ) . in the limit of large negative @xmath176 ( note ,",
    "though , that @xmath126 is physically bounded from below by @xmath178 ) , we have @xmath179 in this limit , the polymer is under compression and responds predominantly elastically , i.e. its internal energy varies as @xmath180 with a prefactor proportional to the effective modulus @xmath169 .",
    "note that the ordinary compression - extension elastic symmetry , i.e. symmetry under @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) , is broken here since the confining wall is not attached to the polymer .",
    "all of the properties of @xmath177 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varepsilon]a . when @xmath176 is not very negative @xmath142 is entropic in nature and vanishes for @xmath183 ( recall that the persistence length of a homogeneous polymer is @xmath184 , hence the factor @xmath185 can be interpreted as the number of times the effective persistence length enters in the size of the polymer ) .",
    "the thermodynamic force related to the external constraint , @xmath186 , is a measurable physical quantity ( e.g.  the pressure on a confining wall ) that can also be calculated .",
    "it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : varepsilon]b , where it is seen that for negative values of @xmath126 near @xmath178 it is linear and its origin is predominantly elastic , as expected from the preceding discussion , while it decays to zero when @xmath128 . for intermediate positive values it is a fluctuation - induced force and the transition between the elastic and fluctuation - induced regimes is not sharp , but is rather smoothed by the temperature .",
    "clearly , for @xmath183 the force is strictly linear at @xmath187 and strictly vanishes for @xmath188 .",
    "next , we turn to discuss the relations between the continuum and discrete theories in light of the results obtained up to now .",
    "in the previous section we saw that various statistical thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous polymers reveal significant differences between the continuum and discrete theories .",
    "that is , the interaction free - energy between the soft and hard segments in eq .   and the fluctuation - induced adsorption force in eq .   feature qualitative discrepancies between the continuum and discrete theories , except for the small contrast limit @xmath157 , where @xmath189 and @xmath190 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath191 identically , while its continuum counterpart is a non - trivial function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , cf .",
    "a corollary is that @xmath156 depends on @xmath29 , while @xmath155 is independent of it , cf .",
    "we stress that these discrepancies are not mitigated when the discretization length is taken to zero , when a different ultra - violet cutoff is used or when the variation of @xmath14 is smoothed out  @xcite . what can one make of these discrepancies ?    obviously , the continuum analysis of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the inhomogeneous polymer , which is the basis for any statistical thermodynamic calculation in the gaussian approximation , is strictly valid only for small wavenumbers @xmath192 .",
    "this is true in general and has been analytically demonstrated in sections [ sec : ct ] and [ sec : dt ] , revealing qualitative differences in the eigenmodes and eigenvalues spectra of the continuum and discrete operators at large wavenumbers .",
    "this by itself does not invalidate the continuum approach .",
    "the pertinent question then is whether a given physical observable is dominated by small wavenumbers , in which case the continuum approximation is valid .",
    "the results of section [ sec : stat ] indicate that this is not the case . beyond the directly observed differences between the continuum and discrete results themselves ,",
    "this can be inferred from the continuum result alone .",
    "let us go back to eq .  ;",
    "the first two contributions to the ( unconstrained ) free - energy on the right - hand - side are `` bulk '' contributions , i.e. terms that scale with the total size of the soft segment @xmath193 and the two hard segments @xmath124 . since @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the uv - cutoff , these contributions depend explicitly on the large wavenumbers and in general are not expected to be correctly described by the continuum theory ( we note again that the fact that the continuum `` bulk '' free - energy is not even strictly extensive in our case , cf .  the second equation in  , is not discussed here ) .",
    "the important point is that in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath196 , these `` bulk '' contributions diverge and are commonly eliminated in standard calculations  @xcite .",
    "we are then left with the last term on the right - hand - side of eq .  , @xmath197 , the interaction free - energy between soft and hard segments .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "shows that the interaction free - energy also scales with @xmath198 and hence depends explicitly on the uv - cutoff , marking the breakdown of the continuum theory in this case .",
    "consequently , the continuum result for the fluctuation - induced adsorption force , @xmath156 in eq .  , scales with the system size @xmath1 and is therefore not dominated by small wavenumbers .",
    "this should be contrasted with casimir - like fluctuation - induced forces in which the interaction energy depends on a geometric degree of freedom , e.g. the separation between two plates , but is independent of @xmath195  @xcite . in this case , after the divergent `` bulk '' contributions are removed , a continuum - level fluctuation - induced force is identified by taking the derivative of the interaction free - energy with respect to the geometric degree of freedom .",
    "it is important to note that a physically realistic fluctuation - induced adsorption force does exist in our problem and is given by the discrete theory result @xmath155 in eq .  .",
    "the continuum analysis presented above bears some similarity to the debye model of the specific heat of homogeneous systems .",
    "there , similarly to the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmodes ] , a continuum - level linear spectrum of wavenumbers replaces the nonlinear spectrum of the discrete theory ( both agree of course for @xmath192 ) , keeping the total number of eigenmodes the same . when coupled to the bose - einstein statistics for the occupation number the heat capacity features the famous @xmath199 behavior at low @xmath2 .",
    "there are two major differences between debye s analysis and ours ; first , our analysis was strictly classical , not taking into account quantum effects such as those incorporated into the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "this makes a difference because the latter provides a physical uv cutoff that at low @xmath2 assigns negligible weight to the high-@xmath53 modes for which the continuum theory is invalid .",
    "second , as we explicitly demonstrated , spatial inhomogeneity gives rise to differences between the continuum and discrete eigenmodes / eignevalues which are not encountered in spatially homogeneous systems .",
    "in contrast to @xmath200 , the fluctuation - induced force associated with an external constraint  @xmath201 derived from @xmath142 of eq .   ",
    "does not depend on @xmath195 and the continuum and discrete predictions coincide .",
    "that is , this fluctuation - induced force is properly described by the continuum theory .",
    "the reason for this is that in this case the relevant fluctuations are shape fluctuations , which are dominated by small wavenumbers ( since the amplitude of the eigenmodes decays with increasing @xmath53 ) .",
    "mathematically speaking , this property is encapsulated in the fact that @xmath202 of eq .  , which is expressed as a sum over wavenumbers , converges to @xmath168 of eq .",
    "after summing over the first few smallest wavenumbers , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : varepsilon ] .",
    "in this paper we studied the mechanics and statistical thermodynamics of semiflexible inhomogeneous polymers .",
    "we focused on inhomogeneity in the form of a soft inclusion embedded inside a stiffer / harder polymer , and considered torsional , extensional and bending gaussian fluctuations .",
    "analytic results for the eigenmodes and eigenvalues spectra of both the continuum and the corresponding discrete dynamical operators were derived .",
    "the analysis revealed qualitative differences between the continuum and discrete spectra .",
    "most notably , it was shown that above a certain wavenumber , the discrete spectrum of wavenumbers @xmath82 changes qualitatively and the discrete modes become evanescent inside the soft inclusion , having no continuum counterparts .",
    "based on the eigenmodes and eigenvalues analysis , we derived explicit expressions for two types of fluctuation - induced forces in the framework of both the continuum and discrete theories .",
    "one fluctuation - induced force is associated with variations of the properties of the inclusion , i.e. its size and strength .",
    "this entropic force describes , for example , the fluctuation - induced contribution to the adsorption of molecules that give rise to the soft inclusion .",
    "another fluctuation - induced force is associated with an external geometric constraint , i.e. a confining wall with variable position .",
    "this entropic force describes the pressure applied by the fluctuating polymer on the wall .",
    "it was shown that the first fluctuation - induced force is dominated by contributions from modes with large wavenumbers , where the continumm and discrete spectra significantly differ , and hence that the continuum theory breaks down .",
    "on the other hand , the second fluctuation - induced force was shown to be dominated by small wavenumber shape fluctuations and hence is properly described by the continuum theory .",
    "the results show that while the continuum theory of inhomogeneous polymers may be successful in some cases , it fails in others , and should be taken with some caution .    _",

    "<S> first , we analytically calculate the complete eigenvalues and eigenmodes spectrum of the inhomogeneous polymer within a continuum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the wavenumber inside and outside of the inclusion is nearly linear in the eigenvalue index , with a nontrivial coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> second , we solve the corresponding discrete problem , and highlight fundamental differences between the continuum and discrete spectra of eigenvalues / eigenmodes . in particular , we demonstrate that above a certain wavenumber the discrete spectrum changes qualitatively and discrete evanescent eigenmodes , that do not have continuum counterparts , emerge . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical thermodynamic implications of these differences are then explored by calculating fluctuation - induced forces associated with free - energy variations with either the properties of the inclusion ( e.g.  inhomogeneity formed by adsorbing molecules ) or with an external geometric constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the former , which is the fluctuation - induced contribution to the adsorbing molecules binding force , is shown to be affected by short wavelengths and thus can not be calculated using the continuum approach . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , on the other hand , is shown to be dominated by long wavelength shape fluctuations and hence is properly described by the continuum theory . </S>"
