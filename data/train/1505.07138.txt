    "<S> in order to achieve efficient parametric frequency comb generation in microresonators , external control of coupling between the cavity and the bus waveguide is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , for passive monolithically integrated structures , the coupling gap is fixed and can not be externally controlled , making tuning the coupling inherently challenging . </S>",
    "<S> we design a dual - cavity coupled microresonator structure in which tuning one ring resonance frequency induces a change in the overall cavity coupling condition . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate wide extinction tunability with high efficiency by engineering the ring coupling conditions . additionally , we note a distinct dispersion tunability resulting from coupling two cavities of slightly different path lengths , and present a new method of modal dispersion engineering . </S>",

    "<S> microresonator - based optical parametric frequency comb generation has demonstrated high performance capabilities @xcite , including mode - locking and octave spanning behavior ; however , in order to achieve efficient and versatile comb generation , active tuning of the cavity coupling condition as well as the cavity dispersion is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> currently , the pump power and cavity detuning are variable parameters used to control the nonlinear interaction , whereas other parameters such as the dispersion , quality ( _ q _ ) factor , and cavity coupling condition are static and are fixed during fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling ratio controls the intensity of the pump and generated comb modes propagating in the resonator and the intensity coupled out of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it also determines the efficiency of the overall comb generation process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion has a key role in phase - matching the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) process , and thus determines the bandwidth of the generated comb . </S>",
    "<S> coupling and dispersion are both designed based on waveguide geometry , so they are generally both immovable . </S>",
    "<S> inherent fabrication variation of dimensions and loss rate also leads to a significant uncertainty of resonance extinction for any designed structure . </S>",
    "<S> post - fabrication extinction control would enable full optimization of device efficiency and increase total device yield . </S>",
    "<S> such a tunable device would be versatile enough to generate a comb of arbitrary bandwidth and optimized efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> tuning the coupling between the bus waveguide and resonator is challenging since in standard passive monolithically - integrated structures , the coupling gap is fixed by design and can not be changed after fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> demonstrations of tunable comb generation have included resonance frequency tunability , which enables control over the operating wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> such tuning has been achieved during comb generation via both thermal and electro - optic means @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coupling gap tunability enables greater control over the comb generation process , allowing for optimization of comb efficiency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coupling tunability has been demonstrated in integrated silicon devices using a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) coupler @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coupling produced by this mzi structure inherently has a sinusoidal wavelength dependence , which can be detrimental to broadband comb generation . </S>",
    "<S> coupling gap tunability can occur in suspended microtoroid and wedge resonator structures , since the devices are operated using suspended tapered fibers @xcite ; however , this approach requires highly stable fiber positioning with accuracy on the scale of tens of nanometers in order to achieve controllable tuning .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we show a dual - cavity coupled microresonator structure in which tuning one microring resonance frequency induces a change in the overall cavity coupling condition , as evident in the transmission extinction ratio . </S>",
    "<S> our structure consists of two identical microring resonators evanescently coupled to each other , with one ring coupled to a bus waveguide [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . due to the evanescent coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the two resonant cavity modes hybridize to form a coupled eigenmode system , in which two superposition eigenmodes ( `` supermodes '' ) are formed : a symmetric ( s ) and an anti - symmetric ( as ) mode . </S>",
    "<S> these two new eigenmodes exhibit modified resonant frequencies , according to :    @xmath3    in which @xmath4 is the average of the individual cavity resonance frequencies , @xmath5 is the difference between the individual cavity resonances ( cavity detuning ) , and @xmath6 is the inter - ring temporal coupling rate . if the cavities are degenerate ( @xmath7 ) , the supermode resonances are split apart from the isolated cavity resonance frequency by @xmath8 . when the inter - ring coupling rate exceeds the individual cavity decay rate , distinct doublet resonances form at each cavity free spectral range ( fsr ) . as the detuning between the two cavities </S>",
    "<S> is varied , a characteristic anti - crossing shape is formed , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . at zero detuning , </S>",
    "<S> light resonantly couples between the two rings , resulting in an equal distribution of light in both cavities [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , middle inset ] , and thus equal extinction in both doublet resonances . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the cavity detuning increases , the distribution of light becomes unequal as the resonant coupling between cavities becomes less efficient . </S>",
    "<S> far from zero detuning , the modes are less hybridized , and most of the light in each of the doublet resonances is concentrated in only one ring or the other [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , left / right insets ] . </S>",
    "<S> the change in detuning also causes the effective cavity length to change , which alters the balance between the round - trip loss and the bus - waveguide coupling . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(b ) shows the simulated doublet resonance shape for three detuning positions along the anti - crossing curve , showing the strong asymmetry in extinction away from zero - detuning .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]     [ fig2 ]     we engineer the ring coupling conditions in order to enable highly efficient , wide extinction tunability . </S>",
    "<S> using a transfer matrix approach , we simulate this structure for high-_q _ silicon nitride ( si@xmath1n@xmath2 ) cavities . along the mode </S>",
    "<S> anti - crossing [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] , the varying mode interaction causes the resonance extinction to change significantly ; this provides our desired tunability . </S>",
    "<S> the device consists of two coupling regions that control the mode interactions : the ring - to - bus coupling region and the inter - ring coupling region . </S>",
    "<S> the ring - to - bus coupling controls the range of accessible extinctions , and the inter - ring coupling controls the efficiency of the tuning . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the resonance extinction along the anti - crossing for various ring - to - bus coupling conditions , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> for all three cases , the extinction approaches a constant value at large detunings when the rings are essentially decoupled , and goes through a steep transition near zero detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the shorter- and longer - wavelength resonances exhibit opposite trends about zero detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum overall coupling - condition for the dual cavity occurs at large detunings , when light is localized entirely in the first cavity , with minimum perturbation from the second cavity . as the second cavity couples more strongly with the first ( at smaller detunings ) , light becomes distributed throughout both rings , effectively decreasing the coupling to the bus waveguide . with heaters to independently tune the cavity resonance frequencies </S>",
    "<S> , we can therefore tune the extinction simply by applying electrical power to the device . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we show that the tuning efficiency , i.e. the slope of the extinction response with @xmath9 , can be tailored by engineering the inter - ring coupling rate . by decreasing the coupling rate , </S>",
    "<S> the anti - crossing response becomes sharper , which improves the tuning efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound on efficiency occurs when the inter - ring coupling is on the order of the cavity decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a higher _ q _ enables higher - efficiency tuning . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a cavity with a _ q_-factor of @xmath10 can tune the extinction from a 1 db under - coupled resonance to 11 db with a refractive index shift of @xmath11 . for a si@xmath1n@xmath2 structure ( exhibiting a thermo - optic coefficient of @xmath12 riu / k ) with heaters as described below , this tuning would require a low power budget of approximately 1 mw of heater power .    </S>",
    "<S> our fabricated devices consist of coupled high-_q _ </S>",
    "<S> si@xmath1n@xmath2 microresonators with tunable extinction ratio via integrated microheaters . </S>",
    "<S> we fabricate a dual coupled microresonator in si@xmath1n@xmath2 with cross - sectional dimensions 950 @xmath13 1400 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the structures are fabricated using a process similar to the one described in @xcite . above the waveguide cladding </S>",
    "<S> , we fabricate integrated microheaters by sputtering platinum and using a lift - off approach , yielding a cross - section of 100 nm tall by 6 @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> m wide . </S>",
    "<S> we position the heaters 1.9 @xmath0 m above the waveguide to ensure negligible optical loss while maintaining close proximity for efficient heat delivery . </S>",
    "<S> these heaters yield an efficiency of @xmath14 riu / mw . </S>",
    "<S> our fabricated devices have an intrinsic _ q_-factor of approximately @xmath10 , and radii of 115 @xmath0 m as well as 75 @xmath0 m , yielding devices with fsr s of 200 ghz and 500 ghz , respectively . this cross - section yields anomalous group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) ( @xmath15 = -180 ps@xmath16/km ) at our pump wavelength of 1560 nm critical to ensure phase matching for parametric comb generation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a micrograph of the 200 ghz fsr device is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the fabricated devices demonstrate good agreement with the simulated extinction tuning . using the integrated microheaters , we first tune ring @xmath172 while keeping ring @xmath171 constant . in order to achieve blue detuning ( @xmath18 ) , we bias heater @xmath171 above room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the blue data points in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) are measured resonance positions as the heater on ring @xmath172 is tuned . the red line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) is a curve fit based on eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) , with an additional parameter included to account for thermal cross - talk between the two rings . </S>",
    "<S> there is good agreement between theory and experiment . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) and ( d ) , we plot the measured extinction as a function of detuning for a critically - coupled device and an over - coupled device , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we see an experimental trend that matches the theoretical curves very closely in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ( blue and green curves , respectively ) . figure 3(e ) shows our ability to compensate for the overall wavelength shift as the extinction is thermally tuned . by tuning both heaters independently for each ring , we are able to compensate for this wavelength shift , and demonstrate 13.3 db of tuning of the resonance extinction , from 0.7 db to 14 db . </S>",
    "<S> since we can keep the resonance in place as the extinction is tuned , this device is useful for real - world applications involving single - frequency lasers .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ]     we show that the dispersion introduced by the coupled cavity geometry is highly tunable , and present a new method for dispersion engineering using modal dispersion . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the dispersion of the inter - ring coupling region is more than one order - of - magnitude smaller than the magnitude of the waveguide dispersion , and thus has a very small effect on the total dispersion . here </S>",
    "<S> , however , we harness the anti - crossing effect to create a much higher dispersion , which is also tunable . dispersion due to higher - order mode - crossings has been investigated recently in liu , et al @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we realize this dispersion tunability using a vernier structure , by ensuring that one ring has a different round - trip optical path length than the other @xcite . having different fsr s , </S>",
    "<S> these cavity resonances operate at different ring detuning values across the spectrum , and thus the resonance splitting becomes wavelength dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the supermode resonance position can be represented in terms of the difference in fsr between the two cavities , @xmath19 , and the cavity mode number , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we rewrite eq . </S>",
