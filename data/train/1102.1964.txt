    "<S> two methods are employed to measure the neutrino flux of the anti - neutrino - mode beam observed by the miniboone detector . </S>",
    "<S> the first method compares data to simulated event rates in a high purity @xmath0 induced charged - current single @xmath1 ( cc1@xmath1 ) sample while the second exploits the difference between the angular distributions of muons created in @xmath0 and @xmath2 charged - current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the results from both analyses indicate the prediction of the neutrino flux component of the pre - dominately anti - neutrino beam is over - estimated - the cc1@xmath1 analysis indicates the predicted @xmath0 flux should be scaled by @xmath3 , while the ccqe angular fit yields @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum of the flux prediction is checked by repeating the analyses in bins of reconstructed neutrino energy , and the results show that the spectral shape is well modeled . </S>",
    "<S> these analyses are a demonstration of techniques for measuring the neutrino contamination of anti - neutrino beams observed by future non - magnetized detectors . </S>"
