    "given a connected graph with @xmath0 vertices and a number @xmath5 $ ] , we consider the following random dynamics : initially every edge is flammable , then successively , in a uniform random order , each edge is either fireproof with probability @xmath6 or set on fire with probability @xmath1 ; in the latter case , the edge burns , sets on fire its flammable neighbors and the fire propagates instantly in the graph , only stopped by fireproof edges .",
    "an edge which has burnt because of the propagation of fire is not subject to the dynamics thereafter .",
    "the dynamics continue until all edges are either burnt or fireproof .",
    "a vertex is called fireproof if all its adjacent edges are fireproof and called burnt otherwise .",

    "if the graph models a network , then the fires may be thought of as infections , and burnt and fireproof vertices respectively as infected and immune nodes . we stress that in the present model , infected nodes do not recover , we talk about a susceptible - infected - removed epidemic , as opposed to susceptible - infected - susceptible epidemics described by usual fire forest models in which the infected nodes recover and may be infected again later , see e.g. drossel & schwabl @xcite . another fire model in which burnt components are removed",

    "this model is in some sense dual to the present one : all edges are present at the beginning but fireproof edges act as barriers that stop the propagation of fires .",
    "the model we investigate was introduced by bertoin @xcite and further studied in @xcite in the special case where the graphs are cayley trees of size @xmath0 , i.e. picked uniformly at random amongst the @xmath7 different trees on a set of @xmath0 labelled vertices . in this paper , we first work in the general tree - setting : @xmath8 is a sequence of random trees , where @xmath9 has size @xmath0 .",
    "our first result gives a criterion depending on the law of @xmath9 in order to observe a phase transition for the proportion of fireproof vertices , in the sense that for @xmath1 smaller than some specified sequence , the proportion of fireproof vertices in @xmath9 converges to @xmath10 in probability , for @xmath1 larger , it converges to @xmath11 , and for @xmath1 comparable to this sequence , there is convergence in distribution to a non - trivial limit .",

    "both results rely on the cut - tree associated with @xmath9 as defined by bertoin @xcite and a certain point process defined in @xcite .",
    "we then investigate more specifically the case of random recursive trees . a tree on the set of vertices @xmath12 \\coloneqq \\{1 , \\dots ,   n\\}$ ] is called recursive if , when rooted at @xmath10 , the sequence of vertices along any branch from the root to a leaf is increasing .",

    "we shall see that random recursive trees fulfill the assumptions of proposition [ pro : transition_de_phase_generale ] ( and proposition [ pro : limite_foret_ignifugee_et_arbres_brules ] ) previously alluded , which reads as follows : denote by @xmath21 the number of fireproof vertices in @xmath14 , then    1 .",

    "using more precise information about the cut - tree of random recursive trees , in particular a coupling with a certain random walk due to iksanov and mhle @xcite , we improve the convergence [ intro - transition_de_phase_arbres_recursifs_sub ] as follows .",

    "we show the following asymptotic estimate for the probability that the root and a uniform random vertex belong to the same fireproof subtree , in both the critical and supercritical cases .

    "then the probability that @xmath36 and @xmath10 belong to the same fireproof subtree converges towards @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",

    "finally , on this event , for every @xmath57 , the vector @xmath58 converges in distribution towards @xmath59    this work leaves open the question of the total number of burnt vertices in the supercritical regime : as in theorem [ thm : limite_nombre_sites_ignifuges_cas_sous_critique ] for the subcritical one , one would ask for a convergence in distribution of @xmath60 , rescaled by some sequence which is negligible compared to @xmath0 .",
    "this holds true for cayley trees , see @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that the present fire dynamics on trees is closely related to the problem of isolating nodes , first introduced by meir & moon @xcite . in this model , one",

    "this random dynamics eventually end when the graph is reduced to the @xmath61 selected singletons , we say that the @xmath61 vertices have been isolated .",
    "the main interest in @xcite and subsequent papers concerns the behavior of the ( random ) number of steps @xmath63 of this algorithm , as @xmath38 and the number of selected vertices @xmath61 is fixed .",
    "we shall see that @xmath63 is related to the fire dynamics on @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , if one sees fireproof edges as being removed from the tree , then a vertex is fireproof if and only if it is isolated . in the context of random recursive trees",
    ", we will rely in particular on results of meir & moon @xcite who estimated the first two moments of @xmath64 , iksanov & mhle @xcite who proved a limit theorem for the latter using probabilistic argument ( it was first derived by drmota _",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ section21 ] , we first state and prove the general phase transition by relating the fire dynamics on @xmath9 to a point process on its cut - tree , following the route of @xcite .",
