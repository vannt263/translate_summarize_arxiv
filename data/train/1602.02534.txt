    "observations of 22 ghz h@xmath2o@xmath3masers have become established as a powerful tool for investigating the inner few parsecs of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and have enabled precise distance measurements to local group galaxies and nearby agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observations of extragalactic masers are of interest for determining the origin of the maser emission ( e.g. , whether it is driven by agns or starburst activity ) , and the suitability of the galaxy for direct distance measurement .",

    ". further monitoring of the velocity ranges in which these new tentative features are seen is required to confirm their existence and trace their variability against the nuclear continuum .",
