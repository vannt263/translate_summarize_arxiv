    "trapped atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) are now routinely produced in various laboratories around the world , and it is important to understand the factors that influence the coherence of atoms transferred from them .",
    "this is an essential issue for the atom laser research , which has the long - term goal of producing continuous , directional , and coherent beams of atoms .",
    "a matter - wave pulse was first produced by using a radio frequency ( rf ) electromagnetic pulse to transfer atoms out of a trap , where they were allowed to fall freely under gravity@xcite .",
    "more recently , a stimulated raman process induced a transition to an untrapped magnetic state in an experiment at nist ; net momentum kick provided by the process resulted in a highly directional beam@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a long beam of atoms falling under gravity was produced in munich using an rf - field - induced transition@xcite .",
    "it is noted that although the more general features of the output in these experiments are fairly well - understood , detailed properties of the atoms in the output beam , and the evolution of the component that remains inside the trap have not so far been investigated .",
    "previous theoretical treatments of the output couplers for condensates have been either limited to a single - mode non - interacting trapped condensate@xcite or to mean field treatment for the condensate@xcite which assume that the output beam is extracted out of a condensate at zero temperature and that they can be described by a single complex function of space and time . however , real condensates appear at finite temperatures , and as a result , thermal excitations play a major role .    in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", we outlined a theory of weak output coupling from a partially condensed , trapped bose gas at finite temperatures . by applying the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory for bose gases at finite temperatures",
    ", we identified three output components .",
    "the first is the output of pure condensates , which we have called `` coherent output . ''",
    "the second is the fraction emerging from the thermal excitations in the trap , which are coupled out of the trap by the process of `` stimulated quantum evaporation . ''",
    "this is equivalent to the quantum evaporation of helium atoms from the surface of superfluid @xmath0he , where phonon excitations travel up to the surface of the superfluid and then spontaneously emerge from the surface as evaporated atoms@xcite . in our case",
    "such an evaporation from the trap is stimulated by an electromagnetic field .",
    "the last output component comes from the process of `` pair breaking , '' which involves simultaneous creation of an output coupled atom and an elementary excitation ( quasi - particle ) within the trap . for suitable choices of the coupling parameters each of the three processes can become the dominant process .",
    "we have shown that output coupling can serve not only as a useful way to extract an atomic beam out of a trap , but also as a probe to the delicate features of the quantum state of the bose gas , including the pair correlations inside the condensate .    in this paper , we present an extensive analysis of the spectrum of the output atoms , and address issues that were not included in our shorter work .",
    "the first is the conditions for the output coupling to give a steady flow of atoms .",
    "we discuss the behaviour of the output rate and the atomic density in the short and the long time regimes , and also discuss the conditions for achieving a steady output beam .",
    "second , the application of output coupling must cause changes in the state of the trapped bose gas , such as changes of the number of excitations relative to the number of condensate atoms in the trap .",
    "we present a thorough discussion of these changes . the state of the bose gas in the trap is usually described by the bogoliubov formalism , which assumes an indefinite number of atoms in the system and therefore is not number - conserving . in this paper",
    "we discuss a number - conserving description of the system , which is especially useful when we consider the process of pair - breaking .",
    "the results of this paper are directly applicable for any output coupling scheme which involves a single trapped state and one output state .",
    "we demonstrate here general fundamental issues by considering a one - dimensional bose gas in a harmonic potential , which is coupled into a free output level in the absence of gravity .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we begin by deriving the equations of motion for the evolution of dynamical variables inside and outside the trap in section  [ sec : gen ] .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : out ] a quasi - steady - state formalism , which enables us to obtain the properties of the output atoms .",
    "we demonstrate the results by a numerical example .",
    "we outline in section  [ sec : dynamics ] the solution to the equations of motion in the trap that were derived in section  [ sec : gen ] , by introducing a number - conserving , time dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formulation in an adiabatic approximation . applying this ,",
    "we obtain expressions for the internal modes of the system in two different regimes , from which the time dependent quasiparticle excitations can be calculated .",
    "finally , discussions and summary are given in section v.",
    "in this section we present our model for describing the output coupling of a trapped bose gas into free output modes .",
    "we derive the equations of motion for the atomic field operators in the trapped and the untrapped states , and give a general form of their solutions .",
    "our model assumes that atoms are initially in an atomic magnetic level @xmath1 ( `` the trapped state '' ) confined by a potential and in thermal equilibrium . a coupling interaction",
    "is then switched on , inducing transitions to a different magnetic level @xmath2 ( the `` free '' or `` untrapped '' state ) .",
    "we stress that these are labels denoting internal atomic levels , not the centre of mass states , so that for short enough times an atom in an @xmath2 state may still be present within the trap .",
    "we use the atomic field operator @xmath3 to describe the amplitude for the annihilation of a trapped atom at point @xmath4 , and the operator @xmath5 to describe the corresponding amplitude for a free , untrapped atom .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 describe the dynamics of the trapped and untrapped atoms respectively while @xmath9 describes the coupling between the two states .",
    "the dynamics inside the trap are given by the many - body hamiltonian : @xmath10 \\hat{\\psi}_t({\\bf   r } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^3 { \\bf   r } \\int d^3 { \\bf   r } ' \\hat{\\psi}_t^{\\dag}({\\bf r})\\hat{\\psi}_t^{\\dag}({\\bf   r } ' ) u_{tt}({\\bf   r}-{\\bf   r}')\\hat{\\psi}_t({\\bf   r}')\\hat{\\psi}_t({\\bf   r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the mass of a single atom , @xmath12 is the potential responsible for the confinement of the atoms in the trap and @xmath13 is the inter - particle potential between the trapped atoms .    with the output atoms , significant effect of their ( elastic ) collisions with the trapped atoms must be taken into account .",
    "in addition , we consider a small rate of output from the trap , so that the output atoms are dilute ; this enables us to neglect the interactions between the free atoms themselves .",
    "since the bose gases are typically so dilute that their mean - free - path for the inelastic collisions is much larger than the dimensions of the atomic cloud in the trap , one may neglect also any inelastic collisions of the output atoms with the trapped atoms@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the output atoms is then given by @xmath14 \\hat{\\psi}_f({\\bf   r } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int d^3 { \\bf   r } \\int d^3 { \\bf   r } ' \\hat{\\psi}_f^{\\dag}({\\bf r } ) \\hat{\\psi}_t^{\\dag}({\\bf   r } ' ) u_{tf}({\\bf   r}-{\\bf   r } ' ) \\hat{\\psi}_f({\\bf   r } ' ) \\hat{\\psi}_t({\\bf   r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the potential that influences the propagation of the output free atoms and @xmath16 is the collisional interaction between the trapped and free atoms ; this is in general different from the interaction @xmath13 .",

    "the upper excited states , in this case , are found to depopulate completely as to be expected . when @xmath232 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nt]d ) the thermal population grows significantly due to transitions of unpaired atoms from the condensate into the excited states .",
    "however , the energy distribution in the lower excited states is a highly non - equilibrium distribution and dissipation and thermalization effects that have not been taken into account in this paper should play a major role .",

    "therefore we have a relatively simple result for the rate of change in energy : @xmath408",
    "in this paper we have set up a general theory of weak output coupling from a trapped bose - einstein gas at finite temperatures .",
    "the formalism developed here is suitable for the discussion of both radio - frequency or stimulated raman output couplers .",
    "it has enabled us to gain much information on the basic features that we expect in real experiments : the time - dependence of the output beam , the effects of excitations in the trapped bose gas and the pairing of particles .",
    "predictions for specific systems can also be based on our theory .    for the time - dependence of the output beam",
    ", we have shown that the output beam is a mixture of components from different origins in the trap .",
    "the output condensate ( @xmath197 ) is the coherent part of the beam , while each excited level @xmath103 in the trap contributes two partial waves : one originating from the process of stimulated quantum evaporation ( @xmath393 ) , where a quasi - particle ( excitation ) in the trap transforms into a real output atom , and the other originating from the pair - breaking process ( @xmath394 ) , where two correlated atoms in the trap transform into a quasi - particle in the trap and a real output atom .",
    "we have shown that a steady monochromatic wave from each component is formed after a time comparable to the inverse of the bandwidth of the corresponding matrix element @xmath166 as a function of @xmath160 .",
    "we have also analyzed the oscillatory behaviour of the output rate at short times and showed the existence of non - propagating bound states in the untrapped level that are formed near the trap as a result of the mixing induced by the output coupler .",
    "as for the evolution of the bose gas in the trap during the process of output coupling , we have shown that for the case of weak coupling an adiabatic approximation may be made , which enables calculation of the composition of the bose gas inside the trap in terms of the adiabatic basis of condensate and excitations .",
    "we have shown that exponential decay of the excitations is expected when the stimulated quantum evaporation process is dominant , while an exponential growth of the number of excitations is expected when the pair - breaking process is dominant .",
    "we have shown that the number of trapped condensate atoms increases in each event of stimulated quantum evaporation , while it decreases by more than 2 atoms per each event of pair - breaking .",
    "however , we stress that a more elaborate number - conserving theory of time - dependent evolution of the bose gas in an open system than that considered here is needed .",
    "the coherence of the output beam was shown to depend on parameters under experimental control such as the detuning of the laser .",
    "we note that the coherence of the output atoms also tells us about the coherence properties of atoms inside the trap ; the coherence of the trapped bose gas is expected to be altered as a direct consequence of the output coupling . in simple terms , when the output atoms are mainly those of condensates we expect the coherence of the internal atoms to drop , if only because the amount of coherent condensate fraction decreases .",
    "the coherence of trapped atoms , although interesting theoretically , is not experimentally verifiable .",
    "apart from designing an atomic laser with well - controlled beam properties , we saw that the measured output properties may be an excellent tool in investigating the nature of trapped bose gases at finite temperatures .",
    "the properties of the output beam may be a probe to the temperature of the trapped bose gas as well as the internal structure of the ground state and the excitations .",
    "the present treatment may be extended to cope with other possible configurations that are likely to appear in the future such as a trap with multi - component condensates and bose gases with negative scattering lengths .",
    "finally we note that the pair breaking process , and indeed the output coupling of the condensate in general , provides an experimentally feasible method to study quantum entanglement in a macroscopic system .",
