    "the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite is a non - linear theory of gravity which undergoes departures from the standard newtonian inverse - square law at a characteristic acceleration scale ; it was proposed to explain certain features of the motion of ordinary electromagnetically detectable matter in galaxies and of galaxies in galactic clusters without resorting to exotic forms of still undetected dark matter .",
    "mond , among other things , does not fulfill the strong equivalence principle in the sense that the internal dynamics of a gravitating system @xmath0 of bodies does depend on the external background gravitational field @xmath2 of a larger system @xmath1 in which @xmath0 is embedded , even if @xmath2 is constant and uniform @xcite ; it is the so - called external field effect ( efe ) .",
    "its effects have mainly been treated in a number of ways in the context of galactic dynamics @xcite , while they have received some attention in the case of the oort cloud in the solar system @xcite .",
    "it is just the case to recall that it moves through the milky way at about 8.5 kpc from its center ; its gravitational attraction at the solar system s location can be evaluated from the magnitude of its centrifugal acceleration @xcite @xmath15 , where @xcite @xmath16 m s@xmath5 is the mond characteristic acceleration scale .",
    "thus , in principle , such an efe should affect the inner dynamics of the solar system .",
    "concerning such an issue , a researcher active in mond writes : he / she also adds that another researcher working on mond tries to go in deeper details by writing : such statements are likely expressions of a widely diffuse belief about efe in solar system .    in this paper",
    "we deal with statements like those previously quoted by showing , in a purely phenomenological way , that they are , in fact , not valid for the motion of the major bodies of the solar system referred to the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) frame usually adopted for planetary data reduction . in particular",
    ", we will address the following points    * does a constant and uniform acceleration @xmath2 having a generic direction @xmath17 and a magnitude of the order of @xmath18 m s@xmath5 affect the motion of the major bodies of the solar system ? * are the effects of such an acceleration negligible for the sun s planets , although they are , in principle , present ? * since @xmath2 is constant and uniform , are its effects canceled out over planetary revolutions",
    "?    we will demonstrate that    * a constant and uniform acceleration does induce non - zero long - period , i.e. averaged over one orbital revolution , effects on the keplerian orbital elements of a planet * by assuming @xmath19 , the resulting perihelion precessions of the inner planets are @xmath9 orders of magnitude larger than the present - day limits on the recently estimated non - standard perihelion rates @xcite .",
    "such an external field @xmath2 , which would not be aligned with the internal newtonian attraction @xmath20 , but it would be directed along a generic direction @xmath17 fixed during one orbital revolution , can be modelled as e = e_x  i + e_y  j + e_z  k , where @xmath21 are assumed constant and uniform , and @xmath22 are the unit vectors of the usual ssb frame used to describe the planetary motions",
    ". the constraints we will obtain are , thus , of dynamical origin and model - independent .      from an observational point of view , the astronomer e. v. @xcite has recently estimated , in a least - square sense , corrections @xmath10 to the standard newtonian / einsteinian averaged precessions of the longitudes of the perihelia of the inner planets of the solar system , shown in table [ chebolas ] ,    .estimated corrections @xmath10 , in units of @xmath23 arcsec cty@xmath24 ( 1 arcsec cty@xmath25 s@xmath24 ) , to the standard newton / einstein perihelion precessions of the inner planets according to table 3 of @xcite ( mercury , earth , mars ) .",
    "the result for venus has been obtained by recently processing radiometric data from magellan spacecraft ( e.v .",
    "pitjeva , private communication , 2008 ) .",
    "the reference frame used is the usual solar system barycentric one.[chebolas ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as a result , we have for the cartesian components of the perturbing acceleration @xmath2 the figures quoted in table [ acci ] . we have obtained them as follows .",
    "first , we have considered the eight different systems of the type of obtained by taking the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath10 for venus , earth and mars according to their best estimates and uncertainties of table [ chebolas ] ; then , after solving them , we computed the means and the standard deviations of the three sets of eight solutions for @xmath21 .",
    "the upper bounds on @xmath21 are @xmath11 m s@xmath5 , @xmath26 m s@xmath5 , @xmath13 m s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the total acceleration is e = ( 0.63)10 ^ -14  m  s^-2.such a constrain , which is a conservative one since we linearly added the uncertainties in @xmath21 to obtain e , is four orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "this substantially confirms our preliminary , non - analytical evaluation .",
    "how could we interpret the results obtained here ?",
    "in fact , there is no contradiction with the findings in @xcite because they are valid in an inertial galactocentric frame , for which the boundary condition at infinity yielding -e  for   r , where @xmath28 is the solution of the modified poisson equation for the gravitational potential in the non - relativistic theory of mond proposed by @xcite , holds . see figure [ gcframe ] in which we have indicated the newtonian monopole term with @xmath20 and the galactic attraction @xmath2 with @xmath29 .",
    "sun - planet system @xmath0 embedded in an external system @xmath1 given by the milky way : galactocentric frame .",
    "in it @xmath20 ( red arrow ) is the newtonian gravitational attraction of the planet by the sun ( the newtonian gravitational attraction of the sun by the planet is not depicted ) , while @xmath30 ( light green arrow ) is the gravitational attraction of the planet by the galaxy whose magnitude amounts to about @xmath8 m s@xmath5 ( in principle , it should also account for the gravitational attraction by other sources external to the galaxy itself as the galaxy m31 andromeda , etc .",
    ": however , their acceleration is of the order of @xmath31 ) . ]",
    "it is not so in the ssb frame used for usual solar system s planetary data reduction because of the centrifugal acceleration which ( almost ) exactly cancels the galactic gravitational attraction throughout ssb leaving just a small net tidal residual @xmath32 , if any , whose magnitude can be easily evaluated as @xmath33 m s@xmath5 .",
    "see figure [ ssbframe ] .",
    "sun - planet system @xmath0 embedded in an external system @xmath1 given by the milky way : heliocentric frame . in it",
    "@xmath20 is the newtonian gravitational attraction of the planet by the sun ( red arrow ) , while @xmath2 is given by the gravitational tidal forces @xmath32 ( olive green arrow ) exerted on the planet by the galaxy whose magnitude amounts to about @xmath33 m s@xmath5 ; they account for both the uniform centrifugal accelerations due to the motion of solar system through the galaxy ( light blue arrow ) and the non - uniform gravitational attraction by the galaxy throughout the extension of the solar system ( light green arrow ) . ]    in other words , the outcome of the gravitational experiment represented by the planetary motion does depend on the velocities of the inertial frames in which it is studied , which are gc ( at rest ) and ssb ( freely falling in the milky way ) .",
    "after all , this should not surprise too much , since mond does , indeed , violate the strong equivalence principle .",
    "in this paper we dealt with the problem of the external field effect in solar system in the framework of the modified newtonian dynamics . in particular , we analyzed the common belief that , in principle , also the internal motions of the sun s planets are affected , in mond , by a constant and uniform acceleration @xmath2 having the same magnitude of the centrifugal acceleration of the solar system s revolution around the galactic center @xmath4 m s@xmath5 , and directed along a fixed direction @xmath17 in space .",
    "it is believed that its magnitude is too small to affect the motions of the major bodies of the solar system , and that its net effects vanish because of its constancy during one planetary orbital revolution .",
    "we found , instead , that such a kind of perturbing acceleration does , in fact , produce non - vanishing net long - period , i.e. averaged over one orbital revolution , orbital effects on the motion of a test particle . among them , of particular relevance are the perihelion precessions because it is possible to compare them to the corrections to the standard newtonian / einsteinian perihelion rates of the inner planets recently estimated with the epm ephemerides in the ssb frame .",
    "as a result , we obtained upper bounds on the components of @xmath2 by finding @xmath11 m s@xmath5 , @xmath12 m s@xmath5 , @xmath13 m s@xmath5 , with @xmath34 m s@xmath5 , i.e. @xmath9 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "this result can be interpreted in terms of a violation of the independence of the outcome of a gravitational experiment from the velocity of the frame in which it is performed , in according with the fact that mond violates the strong equivalence principle .",
    "our results are valid not only for efe in mond , but also for any other putative exotic modification of gravity yielding a constant and uniform net small extra - acceleration which , thus , can be no larger than @xmath36 m s@xmath5 in the solar system",
