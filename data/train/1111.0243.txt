    "another way of studying the system+bath dynamics is to solve the non - markovian master equations @xcite , including some semiclassical approaches @xcite .    here",
    "a non - markovian quantum trajectory theory is used , named non - markovian quantum - state diffusion , that describes the dynamics of a quantum system coupled linearly via position to a environment @xcite . differently from most the previous studies , the environment",
    "is composed by a _ finite _ number , @xmath0 , of uncoupled hos , as studied before for classical systems @xcite . in such cases we say to have a discrete or structured bath .",

    "the physics encountered in this process will help exploring its huge potential @xcite .",
    "some experiments in which the non - markovian behavior arises due to the discreteness of the bath can be mentioned : high - q microwave cavities , quantum optics in materials with a photonic band gap , output coupling from a bose - einstein condensate to create an atom laser @xcite or the decoherence phenomenon @xcite .    from the classical point of view , in the context of finite baths with uncoupled ho , there are some works which analyze the effect of discrete ( structured ) baths on the system energy decay @xcite .",
    "the main result found is that finite baths may induce a non - markovian dynamics on the system particle . from the quantum point of view",

    "the many realizations to solve the stochastic schrdinger equation are done over these normal distributed numbers .",

    "thus , the mean energy over the return times ( where the energy transferred into the bath returns to the system ) is almost constant .    of a system coupled to a bath of one ho .",
    "[ en_lev1 ]    the return times of the energy are strongly dependent on the frequency of the bath oscillator but independent of the coupling intensity .",

    "the time behavior of the energy was also confirmed by the time evolution of the average position : the system symmetrically oscillates very fast around the center @xmath68 , with an amplitude which follows the pattern of energy decay .",
    "namely , the minimum of the energy corresponds to the minimum of the highest amplitude .",
    "figure [ en_lev1 ] shows the time evolution of all the @xmath56 individuals energy levels @xmath69 of the harmonic potential for the same bath used in fig .",
    "numbers denote the energy quantum number @xmath70 .",
    "one can clearly notice that while the lowest states remain practically unchanged , the higher energy levels oscillate following the energy exchange observed in fig .",
    "thus only the highest states are responsible for the energy exchange .    in figure [ ho_10 ]",
    "the energy decay is shown in a semi - log plot for a bath of @xmath71 hos . in the time limit",
    "studied here ( @xmath72 ) one can clearly see that the system energy will not be regained so that the time average from the system energy is not constant anymore .",

    "the qualitative behavior of the energy decay rate changes for different time intervals .",
    "we show by symbols the best fits of the energy decay , namely an exponential fit , @xmath74 , for short times where a markovian dynamics is expected and a power - law fit , @xmath75 , for large times , where a non - markovian dynamics occurs .",
    "we say that the qualitative change from exponential to power - law decay occurs close to times @xmath76 . as inset graph",

    "again it is clear that the higher energy levels decay faster .",
    "something similar was shown to occur with the decoherence rate which is correlated to the highest occupied states @xcite . in the long times region",
    "the energy levels are totally inverted : the highest energy level becomes the smallest one while the ground state energy becomes the most predominant one , followed by the second energy level and so on . by comparison with fig .",
    "[ ho_10 ] we observe that the energy levels start to be totally inverted for times close to @xmath78 , i.  e.  @xmath76 where the transition from exponential to power - law decay occurs . at these times it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ en_lev10 ] that the decay ratio @xmath79 decreases , meaning that the energy inserted in the bath starts to influence back the system dynamics , generating the non - markovian behavior and the observed power law decay .",

    "[ ho_20 ] .",
    "the system continues to behave dissipatively for the integrated time , with an exponential decay , @xmath81 for @xmath82 and a power - law decay @xmath83 for much larger times @xmath84 . for an intermediate time region , starting at @xmath85 and ending at @xmath86 , an additional exponential decay , @xmath87 , was observed .",
    "such kind of behaviors with two exponential decays was encountered until @xmath88 and completely disappeared for @xmath89 . by keeping the same line of arguments of fig .",
    "[ en_lev10 ] we can say that , for a bath of @xmath90 , the total inversion of the energy levels in times induces a power - law decay and the non - markovian behavior .    in figure [ endecay_ho ] we summarize results of the energy decay for @xmath91 @xmath4 hos .",

    "details of the decay exponents will be discussed later in figs .",
    "[ expfits_ho ] and [ powerlawfits_ho ] .",
    "as @xmath0 increases the time interval of power - law decay decreases and vanishes totally for @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , a non - markovian motion is expected only for intermediate values of @xmath0 . for @xmath94 a fluctuating behavior is observed and will be explained below .     instead of looking at the dissipation , it is also possible to analyze the purity from eq .",

    "for the purity , the fluctuating behavior for long times starts with @xmath110 . by increasing @xmath0",

    "now , we explain the wavy pattern noticed for long times region @xmath111 . this phenomenon becomes more visible in the semi - log plot for higher values of @xmath0 and it is a combination of two facts which act together .",
    "the first one is that the difference between the ground state energy level and the second energy level increases by increasing @xmath0 , thus the ground state level becomes more and more predominant , compare figures [ en_lev1 ] and [ en_lev10 ] .",
