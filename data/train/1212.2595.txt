    "1.5    sandpile models are paradigmatic examples of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , a control mechanism that forces a system with an absorbing - state phase transition to its critical point @xcite , without explicit tuning of control parameters @xcite .",
    "soc in a slowly driven sandpile corresponds to an absorbing - state phase transition in a model with the same local dynamics , but a fixed number of particles@xcite , so - called _ conserved sandpiles _ @xcite .",
    "absorbing - state phase transitions arise in the context of spatial stochastic models , and correspond to a transition between an active , fluctuating phase , and an absorbing one , which allows no escape @xcite .",
    "sandpile models with probabilistic toppling rules , typified by the manna model @xcite , are commonly designated as _ stochastic sandpiles _ ; their study has been central to establishing the connection between soc and absorbing - state phase transitions .",
    "an important stochastic model is the oslo model @xcite , inspired by experimental studies on rice piles . in this work",
    "we study a conserved version of the oslo model , characterizing its absorbing - state critical point .",
    "an inconvenient feature of many sandpile models is the absence of an upper bound on the number of particles that may occupy a given site , which complicates theoretical approaches such as @xmath0-site approximations or continuum descriptions .",
    "this motivated the study of _ restricted _ sandpiles @xcite .",
    "in the present work we impose a height restriction on the conserved oslo model .",
    "since the symmetries and conserved quantities of the restricted and unrestricted models are the same , one expects , on the basis of experience with critical phenomena both in and out of equilibrium , that the models belong to the same universality class , as is indeed borne out for conserved versions of the manna model @xcite .",
    "the symmetries here are limited to spatial translation and inversion , while the conservation law is that of particle number .",
    "this universality class has come to be known as the conserved directed percolation ( cdp ) class . on this basis , it would be most surprising if the restricted oslo model were to belong to a different universality class that its unrestricted counterpart .",
    "this question nevertheless merits investigation via numerical simulation .",
    "recently it was suggested that the critical behavior of conserved stochastic sandpiles in fact belongs to the ( non - conserved ) directed percolation class @xcite , but further studies are required to verify this assertion .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the model and in section iii develop a one - site mean - field approximation .",
    "our numerical results are reported in section iv and in section v we present our conclusions .",
    "we study a restricted sandpile model with a variable height limit , defined on a lattice of @xmath1 sites , where @xmath2 is the dimension of space .",
    "the configuration is specified by the particle numbers @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at each site .",
    "each site has a _ critical height _ @xmath5 , with equal probability , such that @xmath6 . a site with @xmath7 is said to be _",
    "any configuration devoid of active sites is _ absorbing _ , i.e. , it admits no escape .",
    "the dynamics of the model proceeds via _ toppling _ of active sites ; each active site has a rate of unity to topple .",
    "( by a `` rate of unity '' we mean that the time unit is chosen such that if there are currently @xmath8 active sites , then the time increment associated with the next toppling is @xmath9 . ) in a continuous - time ( sequential ) dynamics , each active site has the same probability of being the next to topple .",
    "when a site , say @xmath10 , topples , two particles are transferred from @xmath10 to sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , nearest neighbors of @xmath10 .",
    "the two sites are chosen at random , independently , from the set of nearest neighbors , and so are not necessarily distinct ; we refer to this procedure as an _ independent _ toppling rule . due to the height restriction , any particle transfer that would result in a target site @xmath11 having @xmath13 is rejected .",
    "( this means that the configuration @xmath7 , @xmath14 is also absorbing , since no particles can be transferred .",
    "the particle densities of interest in this study , however , remain far below the density associated with this configuration . ) when site @xmath10 loses a particle or particles due to toppling , a new limiting height @xmath15 is selected , equal to 2 or 3 , each with probability 1/2 .",
    "thus the dynamics has three stochastic elements : ( 1 ) the choice of the next site to topple ; ( 2 ) the choice of target sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 for particle transfers ; ( 3 ) the choice of the new limiting height after a site topples .    in practice the next site to topple is selected at random from a list of currently active sites , which must naturally be updated following each toppling event . the time increment associated with each toppling ( whether particles are transferred or not )",
    "is @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the number of active sites immediately prior to the event .",
    "the primary aim of the mean - field analysis is to obtain a preliminary idea of the phase diagram and ( assuming the latter possesses a phase transition ) , an order of magnitude estimate of the critical point .",
    "we consider the simplest mean - field approach , known as the one - site approximation . at this level of approximation",
    ", there are seven possible states @xmath18 for a given site , where @xmath19 represents the occupation number and @xmath20 denotes the limiting height , with associated probabilities denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "taking into account the conditions of normalization @xmath22 and of fixed density , @xmath23 there are only five independent variables at this level .",
    "we begin the analysis by listing the possible transitions between states @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ transitions ] .",
    "each transition ( at a given site , called the _ central site _ in this discussion ) , requires a specific configuration at the central site and at one or both of its nearest neighbors , and a certain redistribution of particles from the toppling site .",
    "( the local configuration and the choice of target sites , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in the particle redistribution are statistically independent events . ) in the one - site approximation , joint probabilities involving two or more sites are factorized . denoting a joint two - site probability by @xmath24 ,",
    "the one - site approximation uses the replacement @xmath25 , and similarly for three - site probabilities .    to illustrate how the rates associated with these transitions are calculated , we discuss some examples .",
    "consider first the transition @xmath26 .",
    "the initial configuration must be either @xmath27 or @xmath28 , that is , the central site must be vacant , have @xmath29 , and have an active neighbor . when the latter topples , exactly one particle must migrate to the central site . on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath2 dimensions , each site has @xmath30 nearest neighbors . since the probability of exactly one particle jumping to the central site is @xmath31 $ ] , the rate ( per site ) of transitions of the kind @xmath26 is @xmath32 where the factor @xmath30 represents the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "consider next the transition @xmath33 , which can occur via two mutually exclusive paths .",
    "in one , both particles liberated when the central site topples attempt to migrate to the same neighbor , an event having probability @xmath34 . in order for both particles to actually migrate , the difference @xmath35 at the target site must be greater than one .",
    "thus the initial configurations for which this transition may occur are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the transition rate for this path is @xmath39 where the factor @xmath40 represents the probability that the limiting height retains the value of 2 following the toppling event . in the other path ,",
    "the two particles migrate to distinct neighbors of the central site .",
    "the configurations that allow this transition to occur are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote , respectively , sites with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus the transition rate for this path is @xmath48 evaluating the rates of the remaining transitions , we find the equations that govern the probabilities @xmath49 at this level of approximation .",
    "the equations for the @xmath21 are    @xmath50(p_{22}+p_{33})+\\frac{1}{4d } [ 1 + 2(2d-1)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times(p_{22}+p_{33})](p_{12}+p_{23})p_{33},\\\\ \\frac{dp_{12}(t)}{dt}&=&\\left ( \\frac{2d-1}{2d}p_{02}-\\frac{4d-1}{2d}p_{12}\\right)(p_{22}+p_{33 } ) + \\frac{1}{4d}\\left [ 1 + 2(2d-1)(p_{22}+p_{33})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times p_{22}(p_{12}+p_{23})+\\frac{1}{4d}\\left[p_{02}+p_{03}+p_{13}+(2d-1)(p_{2^{\\dagger}2}+p_{3^{\\dagger}3})^{2}\\right]p_{33},\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\\\ \\frac{dp_{13}(t)}{dt}&=&\\left ( \\frac{2d-1}{2d}p_{03}-\\frac{4d-1}{2d}p_{13}\\right)(p_{22}+p_{33 } ) + \\frac{1}{4d}\\left [ 1 + 2(2d-1)(p_{22}+p_{33})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times p_{22}(p_{12}+p_{23})+\\frac{1}{4d}\\left[p_{02}+p_{03}+p_{13}+(2d-1)(p_{2^{\\dagger}2}+p_{3^{\\dagger}3})^{2}\\right]p_{33},\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath51(p_{22}+p_{33})+\\frac{1}{4d}\\left [ 1 + 2(2d-1)(p_{22}+p_{33})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times p_{33}(p_{12}+p_{23})-\\frac{1}{2d}\\left[p_{02}+p_{03}+p_{13}+(2d-1)(p_{2^{\\dagger}2}+p_{3^{\\dagger}3})^{2}\\right]p_{22}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2d}\\left [ 1 + 2(2d-1)(p_{22}+p_{33})\\right]p_{22}(p_{12}+p_{23}),\\\\ \\frac{dp_{33}(t)}{dt}&=&\\frac{1}{2d}\\left[p_{13}+(4d-1)p_{23}\\right](p_{22}+p_{33})-\\frac{1}{2d}\\left [ p_{02}+p_{03}+p{13}\\right]p_{33}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{2d-1}{2d}(p_{2^{\\dagger}2}+p_{3^{\\dagger}3})^{2}p_{33}-\\frac{1}{2d}\\left [ 1 + 2(2d-1)(p_{22}+p_{33})\\right]p_{33}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times(p_{12}+p_{23}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solution of the above equations is performed numerically .",
    "we note that in light of the constraints expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , we have only five independent equations .",
    "we also take advantage of the following symmetry : in the mean - field approximation , if @xmath52 initially , then this equality continues to hold throughout the evolution .",
    "a similar relation holds between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we therefore obtain a set of three independent differential equations for @xmath55 , @xmath56 e @xmath57 , which are readily integrated using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme @xcite .",
    "we define the order parameter as the fraction of active sites , @xmath58    numerical integration reveals that in one and two dimensions , @xmath59 as @xmath60 for particle densities @xmath61 , while for higher densities it attains a nonzero stationary value @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ foto9 ] ) , which grows continuously with @xmath63 .",
    "thus in the one - site approximation , the model exhibits a continuous phase transition between an active and an absorbing state .",
    "such a continuous absorbing - state phase transition is familiar from studies of the contact process @xcite , and of conserved stochastic sandpiles , among other models .",
    "we verify that for @xmath64 , @xmath65 approaches its stationary value exponentially : @xmath66 , where the relaxation time @xmath67 depends on @xmath68 , and diverges as @xmath69 , following @xmath70 , as is typical for mean - field analysis of absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the one - site approximation yields the critical exponent @xmath71 , defined via @xmath72 , ( for @xmath73 ) , as @xmath74 for both @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this value is expected for mean - field analysis of continuous absorbing - state phase transitions in models that do not possess up - down ( or particle - hole ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in the absence of such a symmetry , all powers of the order parameter are allowed in the mean - field equations of motion , so that near the critical point , the terms proportional to @xmath77 and @xmath78 dominate ( that is , @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , and the stationary value of @xmath77 is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "we simulate the restricted sandpile model described above in one dimension using periodic boundaries , on rings of @xmath83 , 1000 , 1500 , and 2000 sites .",
