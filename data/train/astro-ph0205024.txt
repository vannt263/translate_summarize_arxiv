    "it is now generally accepted that elliptical galaxies are complicated objects , containing a variety of stellar populations , with a still poorly constrained dark matter content and a multi - component interstellar medium .",
    "the latter , and in particular the interstellar dust component , is not well understood .",
    "nevertheless , knowledge about the dust component in galaxies is of fundamental importance . on the one hand ,",
    "interstellar dust plays an active role in e.g.  interstellar chemistry and star formation , and is therefore a key ingredient to understand galaxy structure and evolution . on the other hand , dust is very effective in absorbing and scattering uv and optical light , and knowledge about its presence , quantity and properties is necessary to correctly interpret any observable .    the far - infrared fluxes detected in the eighties by the _ iras _ satellite at 60 @xmath0 m and 100 @xmath0 m unveiled the presence of a substantial amount of dust in elliptical galaxies ( jura 1986 ; bally & thronson 1989 ; knapp , gunn & wynn - williams 1989 ) . at that time , dust was already observed in the form of dust lanes and patches for a number of early - type galaxies ( hawarden et al .  1981 ; ebneter & balick 1985 ; vron - cetty & vron 1988 ) .",
    "recent surveys indicate that dust extinction features are present in a large fraction of early - type galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ; ferrari et al . 1999",
    "; tomita et al .",
    "2000 ; tran et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these dust features , however , can not account for the high _ iras _ fluxes : the dust masses estimated from the _ iras _ measurements exceed those estimated from integrating the extinction features by nearly an order of magnitude ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the _ iras _ dust mass estimates are a lower limit for the true dust masses , because _ iras _ is not sensitive to cold dust , which emits the bulk of its radiation longwards of 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "calculations with a more realistic dust temperature distribution ( merluzzi 1998 ) and submillimeter observations ( fich & hodge 1993 ; wiklind & henkel 1995 ) may indicate dust masses up to a magnitude higher than the _ iras _ estimates . the only plausible way to solve this dust mass discrepancy is to assume that the interstellar dust in elliptical galaxies exists as a two - component medium : the less massive component is optically visible in the form of dust lanes , whereas the more massive one is distributed diffusely over the galaxy ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .    such a diffusely distributed dust distribution can be traced in two ways .",
    "the most obvious way is to map the thermal emission of the dust with spatially resolved far - infrared or submillimeter observations . a first effort to do this",
    "was undertaken by leeuw , sansom & robson ( 2000 ) , who used _ scuba _ imaging at 850 @xmath0 m to look for thermal emission from dust in ngc4374 .",
    "unfortunately , they could not detect a diffuse dust component , and found that the bulk of the 850 @xmath0 m core emission is more likely the result of synchrotron radiation .",
    "deeper imaging covering a larger wavelength range is necessary to constrain the spatial distribution of dust this way .",
    "hopefully , the new generation of far - infrared and submillimeter instrumentation such as _ sirtf _ and _ alma _ will help to clarify this issue .",
    "a second way in which the diffuse dust component in elliptical galaxies can be traced is by colour gradients : because the extinction efficiency of dust grains decreases with wavelength , a diffuse dust component is expected to generate bluer colours at larger projected radii .",
    "goudfrooij & de jong ( 1995 ) and wise & silva ( 1996 ) found that the dust distributions , necessary to create the colour gradients observed in a sample of elliptical galaxies , are in reasonable agreement with their observed integrated fir fluxes .",
    "however , various arguments seriously complicate the interpretation of colour gradients .",
    "foremost , dust attenuation is not the only process that generates colour gradients : also age and metallicity variations can cause broadband colour gradients . recently , michard ( 2000 ) argued that the mean observed colour gradient ratios of a sample of elliptical galaxies are more likely the result of metallicity than of diffuse dust . and even if the dust attenuation were the only process responsible for the generation of colour gradients , tracing and quantifying the amount of dust would still be complicated .",
    "first , the dust is not located between the source and the observer , but well mixed with the stars .",
    "as a result , the amount of dust is not simply proportional to the amount of reddening ( disney , davies & phillipps 1989 ) .",
    "second , bluing due to scattering partly compensates the effects of reddening due to absorption , which suppresses the formation of large broad band colour gradients even if a substantial amount of dust is present ( witt , thronson & capuano 1992 ) .",
    "we have set up a program to investigate the effects of diffuse dust on the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies . in the first two papers of this series ( baes & dejonghe 2000 , hereafter paper  i",
    "; baes , dejonghe & de rijcke 2000 , hereafter paper  ii ) we investigated how the light profile and the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies are affected by dust absorption . in this series",
    "we extend our models by including the effect of scattering . in section [ rte.sec ]",
    "we explain how the processes of dust absorption and scattering can affect the observables of galaxies .",
    "in particular , we explain how kinematical information can be included in the radiative transfer equation . in section [ montecarlo.sec ]",
    ", we argue that a monte carlo method is the most straightforward way to do this .",
    "we describe the code we developed , with a special emphasis on the calculation of the observed kinematics .",
    "we use this code to investigate the effects of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics in elliptical galaxies . in section",
    "[ galaxymodels.sec ] we present a set of simple elliptical galaxy models , consisting of a stellar and a dust component .",
    "we demonstrate how dust attenuation affects the light profile and observed kinematics of these models in section [ results.sec ] .",
    "section [ discussion.sec ] is devoted to a discussion of our results , and finally , section [ conclusions.sec ] sums up .",
    "the basis for any study of attenuation is the radiative transfer equation ( rte ) , which statistically describes the interaction between matter and light . in a general form",
    ", the time - independent rte can be written as ( chandrasekhar 1960 ; mihalas 1978 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the path length , and @xmath3 represents the intensity at a position @xmath4 into a direction @xmath5 .",
    "the right - hand side of the equation contains two terms that represent how the radiation field changes as a result of interactions with the matter . the first term , the total emissivity @xmath6 accounts for the sources of the radiation field .",
    "the second term , where @xmath7 is the total opacity coefficient , represents the sinks .",
    "the specific form of both terms depends on which physical processes are taken into account , ( e.g.  stellar emission , absorption , scattering ) and they can be complicated functions that depend on the intensity itself .    in a galaxy without dust attenuation , there are no sink terms , and the only source in the radiation field is the ( isotropic ) emission of photons by stars , such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the stellar emissivity . if we take absorption by dust grains into account , a sink term must be added , which accounts for the loss of photons from the radiation field .",
    "the total opacity then equals the absorption coefficient , i.e.@xmath10 . in either of these situations ,",
    "the rte is a ordinary differential equation , and it can be solved by an integration along the line of sight .",
    "dust grains do not only absorb photons , they also scatter them , i.e.  a number of photons are , as a result of an interaction with a dust grain , removed from their path and sent into another direction .",
    "this physical process is not a rare phenomenon : for typical milky way dust grains , the probability for scattering even slightly exceeds the probability for absorption in the optical wavelength range ( table [ dustprop.tab ] ) .",
    "it is therefore obvious that scattering should be included in radiative transfer calculations .",
    "this will add two extra terms to the rte .",
    "the first one is a sink term that accounts for the loss of photons scattered out of the beam .",
    "the total opacity will hence be the sum of the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient , @xmath11 .",
    "the second extra term is a source term that characterizes the gain of photons scattered into the beam .",
    "more precisely , this term will contain the contribution of photons that had another direction @xmath12 , but are now scattered into the direction @xmath5 .",
    "generally , the distribution of angles after a scattering process are described by a scattering phase function @xmath13 , which describes the probability that a photon which comes from the direction @xmath12 and is scattered at @xmath4 , will have @xmath5 as its new direction . by convention ,",
    "it is normalized as @xmath14 the fraction of the intensity scattered from a solid angle @xmath15 around an arbitrary direction @xmath12 into the direction @xmath5 will therefore equal @xmath16 , such that the extra source term that has to be added to the rte reads @xmath17 it is convenient to introduce the scattering albedo @xmath18 as the ratio of the scattering coefficient to the total opacity coefficient , @xmath19 we finally find for the rte , @xmath20 the inclusion of scattering turns the rte into a integro - differential equation , far more complicated than the ordinary differential equation if only absorption is taken into account . in particular , the scattering term is responsible for the coupling of the rte along different paths : due to the integration over the angle , we can not solve the rte for a single path , but we have to solve it for all paths at the same time",
    ".      the complexity of the rte does not only depend on which physical processes are taken into account ( the right - hand side ) , but also on the geometry of the system .",
    "indeed , the path length appearing in the left - hand side of the rte is in general a function of position and direction , i.e.  @xmath21 . as a consequence ,",
    "the ( time - independent ) rte is a partial differential equation with five independent coordinates ( see e.g.  mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "this complexity , however , is reduced if the system has symmetries .",
    "for example , in an axially symmetric geometry , the azimuthal dependence vanishes , such that only four independent coordinates need to be considered .",
    "particularly interesting is the spherical geometry , because in that case only two coordinates remain : the radius @xmath22 and the cosine @xmath0 of the angle between the direction @xmath5 and the local radial direction .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a global picture of the effects of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies , rather than modelling a specific , possibly geometrically complex object . for this goal ,",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is satisfactory .",
    "there are no ways to solve the general rte ( [ rte_dust ] ) analytically , but several techniques have been developed to solve it numerically . and",
    "because many astrophysical systems can in a first approximation be considered spherically symmetric , many efforts have yet been spent on the rte in a spherical geometry .",
    "the pioneering work started nearly 70 years ago ( kosirev 1934 ; chandrasekhar 1934 ) , and , in particular since the 1970s , a vast number of different approaches has been developed ( e.g.  hummer & rybicki 1971 ; schmid - burgk 1975 ; witt 1977 ; flannery , roberge & rybicki 1980 ; yorke 1980 ; rowan - robinson 1980 ; rogers & martin 1984 ; peraiah & varghese 1985 ; gros , crivellari & simonneau 1997 ) .",
    "most of these techniques , however , are not suitable for our needs , because it seems hard ( and at least not obvious ) to extend them such that they can handle kinematical information . only for monte carlo methods",
    ", the kinematical information could be included in an elegant way .      as long as scattering",
    "is not taken into account , the inclusion of velocity information in the rte is rather straightforward .",
    "indeed , instead of taking into account the entire stellar emissivity , we can just consider the light from those stars whose velocity component in the direction of the observer equals @xmath23 .",
    "the emissivity of these stars is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the spatial losvd , i.e.  the probability for a star at position @xmath4 to have a velocity component @xmath23 in the direction @xmath5 ( appendix  a ) .",
    "solving the rte with this emissivity , we obtain the losvds observed in the plane of the sky . hence ,",
    "if either dust attenuation is completely neglected or only absorption by dust grains is taken into account , the observed losvds can be calculated from the spatial losvds through a single integration along the line of sight .",
    "similar relations hold between the moments of the distribution function , and the moments of the losvds , e.g.  the observed velocity dispersion profile can be determined from the intrinsic velocity dispersions by a simple integration along the line of sight . for more details , we refer to paper  i.        when scattering is included , however , the inclusion of kinematical information becomes much more complicated , because the velocities of both the stars and the dust grains that scatter their light need to be taken into account .",
    "consider , for example , fig.[kininfo.eps ] .",
    "a photon with rest wavelength @xmath26 is emitted by a star moving with a velocity @xmath27 into a direction @xmath28 ( in a reference frame centered on the galaxy center ) .",
    "assume this photon is scattered by a dust grain moving with velocity @xmath29 , and then scattered towards the observer .",
    "the wavelength `` detected '' by the dust grain is determined by the relative velocity between star and dust grain , i.e.  the dust grain detects a wavelength @xmath30.\\ ] ] the dust grains scatters the photon coherently into the direction @xmath31 , such that the wavelength detected by the observer equals @xmath30      \\left[1-\\frac{({{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_d+{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\text{sys}})\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_{\\text{obs}}}{c}\\right ] , \\label{lam1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the system velocity with respect to the observer .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity @xmath23 detected by the observer can be found from the relation @xmath33 , \\label{lam2}\\ ] ] which defines @xmath23 and already incorporates the system velocity .",
    "because the velocities of dust grains and stars in galaxies are very small compared the speed of light , second order terms in @xmath34 can be safely neglected , such that with ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam2 ] ) , @xmath35 when more scattering events are involved in the photon s trajectory , the relative velocities of each pair of subsequent dust grains have to be taken into account .",
    "if we denote the total number of scattering events with @xmath36 , the velocities of the dust grains with @xmath37 and the propagation directions with @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) , we obtain @xmath40 in general , therefore , the inclusion of kinematical information into radiative transfer problems is very complex .",
    "for our problem of dust attenuation in elliptical galaxies , however , we can make one assumption that reduces the complexity considerably : the summation in formula ( [ vvv ] ) , i.e.  the common contribution of the dust velocities , is in general negligible with respect to the first term , the contribution of the stellar velocity .",
    "several arguments support this assumption . [ 1 ]  it is reasonable to assume that the dust grains have smaller velocities than the stars in elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , if the dust grains were to have large velocities , they would collide and heat up .",
    "however , the lion s share of the dust in elliptical galaxies is assumed to be cold ( fich & hodge 1993 ; goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; wiklind & henkel 1995 ; merluzzi 1998 ) . [ 2 ]  scattering off interstellar dust is generally anisotropic , with a larger probability for forward scattering ( see section [ phafu.sec ] ) . in appendix",
    "b we show that the anisotropic nature of scattering contributes to reducing the importance of the dust grain velocity terms in equation ( [ vvv ] ) .",
    "[ 3 ]  there is no reason why the velocity of dust grains in an elliptical galaxy would have a preferential direction .",
    "the individual terms in the summation in formula ( [ vvv ] ) will therefore have a random sign , and the summation will in the mean be washed out by multiple scattering .    as a consequence",
    ", we can write equation ( [ vvv ] ) simply as @xmath41 .",
    "each photon hence carries the velocity component of the star in the direction of the emission of the photon .",
    "we constructed a monte carlo code to solve our radiative transfer problem .",
    "usually , the main argument against monte carlo methods is that it is computationally rather expensive compared to other methods ( see e.g.  baes & dejonghe 2001a ) .",
    "it has other advantages , however , which make it very competitive , in particular in an era when cpu time is not the most stringent limitation anymore .",
    "important qualities of the monte carlo method are the possibility for a proper error analysis and a very wide flexibility .",
    "nice examples of this flexibility are the ability to handle arbitrary geometries ( wolf , fischer & pfau 1998 ; wood & reynolds 1999 ; gordon et al . 2001 ) , the polarization of the scattered radiation ( code & whitney 1995 ; bianchi , ferrara & giovanardi 1996 ) , the clumpiness of the interstellar medium ( witt & gordon 1996 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the self - consistent heating and re - emission of the absorbed radiation ( wolf , henning & stecklum 1999 ; bianchi , davies & alton 2000 ; misselt et al.2001 ) .",
    "we make use of another possibility of the monte carlo method : its ability to include kinematical information in an elegant way .",
    "this possibility has recently been explored by matthews & wood ( 2001 ) , who studied the effect of dust attenuation on the observed rotation curve in the spiral galaxies .",
    "our modelling opens up the possibility to construct all losvds and hence to investigate the entire observed kinematical structure of galaxies .",
    "the principles of the monte carlo technique are outlined in detail by various authors ( cashwell & everett 1959 ; mattila 1970 ; witt 1977 ; yusef - zadeh , morris & white 1984 ; fischer , henning & yorke 1994 ; bianchi et al .",
    "basically , the routine consists of following the individual trajectory of a very large number of photons through the galaxy .",
    "a photon s history is given by a number of quantities such as the position and propagation direction at birth , the distance the photon travels before it interacts with a dust grain , the kind of this interaction , etc .",
    "each of these quantities is described statistically by a random variable , taken from a particular probability density .",
    "our approach is based on witt ( 1977 ) and bianchi et al .",
    "it includes the use of a continuous three - dimensional cartesian reference system ( no grid ) .",
    "furthermore , we use the classical tricks to optimize the routine : we assign a weight to each photon in order to avoid the loss of photons due to absorption , and we apply the forced first scattering mechanism to improve the statistics of the scattered radiation ( cashwell & everett 1959 ; witt 1977 ) .",
    "the novelty of our monte carlo code is that it can calculate both photometric and kinematic data : not only the light profile , but also the losvds and the projected kinematic moments .",
    "it simultaneously calculates these data in three modes : without dust attenuation , with only absorption taken into account and with dust attenuation fully taken into account .",
    "it is a monochromatic code , i.e.  it calculates the observables in one single wavelength .",
    "if desired , the wavelength dependence of the results can be investigated by running the code various times at different wavelengths .",
    "we implemented the central wavelengths of the optical @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the near - infrared @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 broadbands .",
    "the light profile of the galaxy is constructed by simulating an imaging process .",
    "if a photon leaves the galaxy , we record the position of the last scattering event and the final propagation direction of the photon . because in spherical symmetry , a path can be determined by its projected radius",
    ", we only need to record the projected radius of the photon s final path .",
    "the registration of the photons is done by constructing a histogram of the photons leaving the galaxy as a function of @xmath45 , where the contribution of each photon is measured by its weight ( see witt 1977 ) .",
    "the monte carlo method provides an elegant possibility to include kinematical information .",
    "indeed , we argued that the velocity information that a photon carries is essentially the velocity component of the star in the direction of the emission .",
    "this extra information can easily be included in the monte carlo routine .",
    "the only extension is that we do not only have to generate an initial position and propagation direction for each photon , but also a stellar velocity .",
    "the initial position and the stellar velocity have to be extracted in accordance with the phase space distribution function @xmath50 , which represents the probability of finding a star at the position @xmath4 with velocity @xmath51 . a practical way to do so , is following the strategy of wybo & dejonghe ( 1996 ) , who generated sets of phase space coordinates of stars to create @xmath52-body representations of globular clusters . first",
    ", a random position @xmath53 is determined from the stellar emissivity , and then a random stellar velocity @xmath27 is generated from the three - dimensional probability density @xmath54 , using the acceptance - rejection method ( abramowitz & stegun 1965 ; press et al .",
    "next , we determine a random emission direction @xmath28 , and determine the velocity component of @xmath27 in the direction @xmath28 , i.e.@xmath55 . given these initial conditions , we follow the photon until the exit conditions are satisfied , and calculate the projected radius of the final line of sight .",
    "the photon will then be stacked , according to its weight , in the appropriate bin in a two - dimensional array with axes @xmath45 and @xmath23 .",
    "this process is repeated this for a large number of photons and two - dimensional histograms are formed .",
    "this method can be optimized in two ways .",
    "firstly , we see that the velocity vector @xmath27 does not show up in the monte carlo procedure itself , but only in the classification process .",
    "moreover , we actually do nt need the entire information contained in the velocity @xmath27 : we only need the component @xmath23 of the velocity in the direction @xmath28 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to generate a random @xmath23 from the spatial losvd @xmath56 , which represents the probability density of line - of - sight velocities for a star at position @xmath53 in the direction @xmath28 . instead of generating a three - dimensional velocity vector for each photon in the beginning of the monte carlo cycle ,",
    "it is hence sufficient to generate one single line - of - sight velocity component .",
    "this saves many random number generations and distribution function evaluations , which are costly processes .",
    "a second optimization eliminates the generation a @xmath23 altogether . instead of generating one single random @xmath23 ,",
    "we can , for each bin in the velocity direction , calculate the probability that the line - of - sight velocity will fall in that bin .",
    "if the boundaries of a bin are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , this probability equals @xmath59 for each photon , we assign a weighted value to each velocity bin corresponding to the final projected radius , which gives better statistics than dropping the photon in a single bin",
    ".      of course , we are not able anymore to write down a direct connection between the intrinsic moments of the distribution function and the projected moments on the plane of the sky , contrary to the absorption - only case ( paper  i ) .",
    "instead , we will calculate the projected moments directly from the obtained losvds .",
    "the projected kinematics we consider are the mean projected velocity @xmath60 , the projected velocity dispersion @xmath61 , the skewness @xmath62 , the kurtosis @xmath63 , and the lowest order gauss - hermite coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note , however , that for spherically symmetric non - rotating galaxies all odd moments vanish , i.e.  @xmath66 .",
    "obviously , a reliable error analysis is necessary to estimate the accuracy of the results .",
    "but it will be even more important in a later stage .",
    "indeed , we are presently incorporating this radiative transfer mechanism into the qp program ( dejonghe 1989 ) , a code for the dynamical modelling of gravitating systems .",
    "therefore , it is necessary that we can dynamically evaluate the error bars on any observable : the program has to be able to calculate any observable with an preset accuracy , required by either the user or another part of the code itself .",
    "monte carlo methods satisfy this need : they can keep on adding photons until any accuracy requirement is satisfied .",
    "the determination of the errors is easy for observables that are directly proportional to the number of photons detected in the bins , e.g.  the intensity . because of",
    "the poisson character of the noise , the error bars on these quantities can be directly calculated from the square root of the number of photons .",
    "the observed kinematics we calculate , however , are not directly proportional to number of photons obtained in the bins , such that we can not adopt this simple procedure . therefore , we estimate the error on our observables using an alternative method .",
    "assume we have calculated a value @xmath67 for a given observable ( either photometrical or kinematical ) after a run with @xmath52 photons .",
    "we divide the total number of photons in @xmath36 subsets , and for each of these subsets , we calculate the corresponding observable @xmath68 .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath67 is estimated as , @xmath69^{1/2}.\\ ] ] typically , we set @xmath70 , and we adopt a minimum number of @xmath71 photons , i.e.  @xmath72 photons per subset .",
    "to investigate the effects of dust attenuation on the light profile and the observed kinematics , we will adopt a set of dusty galaxy models , similar to those in paper  i and paper  ii .",
    "they are spherically symmetric , and consist of a stellar and a dust component .",
    "we adopt a core radius @xmath74kpc , a total mass @xmath75m@xmath76 and a ( constant ) mass - to - light ratio @xmath77@xmath78 , such that the total emitted luminosity equals @xmath79l@xmath76 .",
    "as in paper  i , we consider different plummer models , each with a different value for the parameter @xmath80 , which describes the internal anisotropy of the stellar orbits .",
    "we adopt three different models : a radial model ( @xmath81 ) , the isotropic model ( @xmath82 ) and a tangential model ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "these are the same values as in paper  i , except that we replace the radial model with @xmath84 by the model with @xmath81 .",
    "the reason for preferring @xmath81 above @xmath84 has a computationally nature : the spatial losvds can be calculated analytically for @xmath81 , whereas this is not possible for the @xmath84 model ( appendix  a ) .      as shown in section [ genrte.sec ] , a complete characterization of the dust component",
    "requires a specification of the opacity @xmath85 , the albedo @xmath86 and the scattering phase function @xmath87 .",
    "the opacity sets the total amount of dust and its spatial distribution , whereas the other two quantities describe the optical properties at a given distance to the galaxy centre . in order to limit the number of parameters in our model",
    ", we will assume that the optical properties of the dust grains are the same all over the galaxy , such that the albedo and the phase function become independent of @xmath22 .",
    "we will return to this assumption in section 5.3.3 .",
    "we adopt the same family of dust components considered in paper  i and paper  ii , characterized by the dust number density @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the dust density at the center of the galaxy , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 determine the actual shape of the dust distribution . because the effect of varying @xmath91 and @xmath90 are roughly similar , we restrict ourselves to varying the dust exponent @xmath91 , and we fix the dust core radius to @xmath74  kpc , equal to the stellar core radius .",
    "the variation of @xmath91 still allows us to explore a large variety of star - dust geometries : small values of @xmath91 correspond to centrally concentrated distributions , whereas for large @xmath91 the distribution is shallower ( paper  i ) .    at a fixed wavelength @xmath92",
    ", the opacity function @xmath93 can be derived from the dust density by multiplication with the ( wavelength - dependent ) dust cross - section @xmath94 . to characterize the dust distribution at a given wavelength ,",
    "we thus need three parameters : the dust exponent @xmath91 , the central dust number density , and the dust cross - section @xmath94 .",
    "it is more convenient , however , to use another , equivalent , set of parameters .",
    "indeed , if the opacity function is known at one particular wavelength , it can be determined at any other wavelength . usually , the _ v_-band is used as the reference wavelength .",
    "we can then write @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the extinction coefficient , relative to the _ v _ band .",
    "it is then customary to introduce the total _",
    "v_-band optical depth as is defined as the optical depth from the center of the galaxy to the edge .",
    "we want to stress that this definition differs a factor 2 with the definition of the optical depth we adopted in paper  i and paper  ii , where we defined @xmath97 as the total optical depth along the central line of sight , i.e.  from one edge to the other .",
    "the definition of @xmath97 we adopt here , however , is more commonly used , and it will allow the reader to link the obtained results more easily to those found in the literature ( e.g.  witt et al .  1992 ; wise & silva 1996 ) .",
