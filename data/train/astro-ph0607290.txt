    "while our understanding of the outflows from luminous ob - stars was thought to be well established , recent evidence indicates that currently accepted mass - loss rates _ may _ need to be revised downwards _ by as much as a factor of ten_. this is a consequence of previously neglected `` clumping '' of the wind , which affects mostly those diagnostics which are sensitive to the _ square _ of the density , @xmath0 ( such as recombination lines or free - free continua ) .    considering that numerous stellar - evolution calculations have demonstrated that changing the mass - loss rates of massive stars by even a factor of two has a dramatic effect on their evolution ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", it is evident that such revisions would have enormous implications , not only regarding evolution , but also regarding the feed - back from massive stars . in this article , we will summarize the knowledge which has been accumulated lately and consider the question concerning the real mass - loss rates from massive star winds .",
    "traditionally , the mass - loss rates , @xmath1 , of luminous ob stars have been inferred from , primarily , three types of measurement ( see also de koter , this volume ) : + were the first diagnostics to be used to measure wind - densities .",
    "this approach has been pioneered by @xcite in their work on the  mass ejection from the o4f star zeta puppis \" , where they derived a mass - loss rate of @xmath2 , a number which is still valid !",
    "the most commonly used method to analyze p - cygni lines is the so - called sei - method @xcite , which has been firstly applied by @xcite .",
    "though most of the uv p - cygni lines are resonance lines from dominant ions being _ linearly _ dependent on density and thus remaining uncontaminated from _ direct _ clumping effects ( but see sect .",
    "[ pv ] ) , only the product @xmath3 can be inferred from these lines , where @xmath4 is the ionization fraction of the corresponding ion .",
    "moreover , most of these lines are inevitably saturated in stars with strong winds , since they arise from _ abundant _ elements , and only lower limits on @xmath1  can be provided in these cases . +",
    "samples the outermost and intermediate region of the wind ( @xmath5(100 , 10  @xmath6 ) ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding methods base on the work by @xcite/@xcite ( radio ) and @xcite ( ir - excess ) .",
    "they have been applied , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite to derive ob - star radio mass - loss rates , and by @xcite to investigate the ir excess of @xmath7 pup by means of iras observations .",
    "since the involved processes are dominated by free - free and bound - free transitions which scale with @xmath8 , inferences from the measurements are extremely sensitive to clumping in the wind .",
    "+ usually modelled using nlte atmosphere codes , also depends on @xmath8 , and is therefore also sensitive to clumping , but samples the innermost portion of the wind ( @xmath9@xmath6 ) .",
    "the idea to exploit h@xmath10  as a standard mass - loss indicator goes back to @xcite , and has been firstly applied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further refinements have been provided by @xcite .",
    "the present hypothesis states that clumping is a matter of _ small - scale _ density inhomogeneities in the wind , which redistribute the matter into clumps of enhanced density embedded in a rarefied , almost void medium .",
    "the amount of clumping is conveniently quantified by the so - called clumping factor , @xmath11 , which is a measure of the over - density inside the clumps ( compared to a smooth flow of identical average mass - loss rate ) .. ] as already pointed out , diagnostics that are linearly dependent on the density are insensitive to clumping , whilst those sensitive to @xmath8 will tend to overestimate the mass - loss rate of a clumped wind , by a factor @xmath12 . for further details , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .    until to date",
    ", the most plausible physical process responsible for small - scale structure formation in massive star winds is the so - called line - driven instability , found already in the first time - dependent hydrodynamical simulations of such winds @xcite ; for recent investigations , see @xcite with respect to 1-d simulations and @xcite for first attempts to include 2-d processes .    though predicted from the earliest hydro - models on ( and even before , see @xcite ) , it took some while to incorporate clumping into the _ atmospheric models _ of massive stars , firstly for wolf - rayet ( wr ) atmospheres , in order to explain + ( a ) the strength of the observed electron scattering wings ( @xmath0-dependent ) _ in parallel _ with the strength of the underlying ( @xmath8-dep . )",
    "emission lines @xcite , + ( b ) the so - called momentum problem of wr winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , + ( c ) the presence and variability of sub - structures in wr emission lines , by invoking supersonic turbulence leading to clumping factors of the order of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of wr winds , the diagnostics of ob - star winds did not render any necessity for ( significant ) clumping until recently . in particular , two major arguments supported the view of a rather smooth , almost unclumped flow : + 1 .",
    "the investigations by @xcite and @xcite showed that h@xmath10  _ and _ radio mass - loss rates are similar for a large sample of stars ( but see also @xcite who noted a discrepancy by a factor of two , the former being larger ) .",
    "since h@xmath10  forms in the lower and the radio emission in the outer wind , this would imply a similar degree of clumping in both regions , which seemed to be improbable and is also in contradiction to theoretical predictions .",
    "the observed _ wind - momentum rates _ were found to be in rather good agreement with theoretical predictions for this quantity , obtained from different , independent investigations @xcite .",
    "a pure coincindence of this agreement seemed to be rather unlikely .",
    "+ taken together , it was concluded that clumping effects in ob - star winds should be negligible .",
    "as stated in the introduction , recent evidence points to the notion that this conclusion might be incorrect . in the following",
    ", we will summarize the different indications for significant clumping in ob - star winds accumulated so far . from the observational side ,",
    "there is , to our knowledge , only one _ direct _ evidence for clumping . from a temporal analysis of heii 4686 , (",
    "* in particular their fig .",
    "2 ) found `` outward moving inhomogeneities '' in the wind of @xmath7  pup , from regions near the photosphere out to 2 @xmath6 .",
    "all other evidence is indirect , and the derived clumping factors cover a large range .",
    "+ ( a ) from polarimetry and using simplified models , clumping factors of the order of @xmath14=2 are found ( davies , this volume ) .",
    "+ ( b ) the analysis of radio and submm data from @xmath15  ori and @xmath7  pup @xcite indicates a clear submm excess in both cases , which can be explained by ( enhanced ) clumping in the intermediate wind ( @xmath16 ) ( see also blomme , this volume ) .",
    "+ ( c ) nlte model atmosphere analyses of uv spectra ( partly incl . the optical range ) of various o - stars indicate clumping factors of the order of @xmath17 , but show that only few lines are suited to discriminate between clumped and unclumped flows . from these analyses ( cf .",
    "table  [ tabfcl ] ) , it was concluded that clumping , if present , should begin rather close to the wind base , at a few tens of @xmath18 .",
    "this finding is in contrast to hydrodynamical simulations , which show that the line - driven instability needs a certain time to grow and to become non - linear , so that significant clumping is expected not before 1.2 to 1.3 @xmath6 .",
    "[ tabfcl ]    \\(d ) from detailed investigations of the wind - momentum rates of a large sample of o - stars , @xcite and @xcite found that supergiants with h@xmath10  in emission lie above the theoretical wind - momentum luminosity relation ( wlr ) , whereas the rest fits almost perfectly .",
    "since the wlr should be independent of luminosity class ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this discrepancy was interpreted in terms of clumpy winds , with @xmath19 , and mass - loss rates reduced by factors between 2 and 3 .",
    "+ ( e ) a compelling , independent indication of clumping comes from sei analyses of the p - cygni pv@xmath20 resonance line doublet ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also massa , this volume ) , which has only become widely accessible since the launch of _",
    "because phosphorus has a low cosmic abundance , this doublet never saturates in normal ob stars , providing useful estimates of not only @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "[ diag ] ) but also @xmath1  itself , _ when _",
    "p@xmath21 is the _ dominant ion _  as it is implied at least for mid - o star winds .",
    "these mass - loss rates turned out to lie considerably below those inferred from other diagnostics such as h@xmath10  or radio emission . the most reasonable way to reconcile these results",
    "is to invoke extreme clumping in the wind ( pv as a resonance line remains insensitive to _ direct _ clumping effects ) , indicating clumping factors of the order of @xmath22 ( or even more ) .",
    "accordingly , the actual mass - loss rates should be _ much _ lower than previously thought , by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "further comments are given in sect .",
    "[ pv ] + ( f ) using similar methods , @xcite showed that the unsaturated p cygni lines in lower luminosity b supergiants give , again , a factor of 10 lower mass - loss rates than theoretically expected .",
    "* see also crowter , this volume ) , on the other side , found reasonable agreement between observed and predicted mass - loss rates for early / mid bia supergiants , with similar ( though unconstrained ) clumping factors in the lower and intermediate wind .",
    "whereas most of the above investigations are concerned with a _ global _ ( i.e. , radially almost constant ) clumping factor or derive this quantity for certain wind regions only , there is , of course , the additional question regarding the radial stratification of @xmath14 . to this end ,",
    "@xcite recently performed a self - consistent analysis of h@xmath10 , ir , mm and radio fluxes , thus sampling the lower , intermediate and outer wind in parallel .",
    "this study comprises a sample of 19 galactic o - type supergiants and giants with well known stellar parameters ( from @xcite and @xcite ) , employing own measurements / archival data for h@xmath10 , ir / mm fluxes ( _ scuba _ ) and new _ vla _ observations , including objects with h@xmath10  in absorption , i.e. , low density winds .",
    "a major result of this investigation is that in _ weaker _ winds the clumping factor is the same in the inner ( @xmath24 ) and outermost regions .",
    "however , for _ stronger _ winds , the clumping factor in the inner wind is larger than in the outer one , by factors of 3 to 6 .",
    "this finding points to a physical difference in the clumping properties of weaker and stronger winds ( and may be related to the excitation mechanism of the structure formation ) . in terms of mass - loss rates",
    "then , we find @xmath1(radio ) @xmath25 @xmath1(h@xmath10 ) for weak winds with h@xmath10  in absorption , whereas for all stars with h@xmath10  in emission we obtain @xmath1(radio ) @xmath25 0.4  0.5 @xmath1(h@xmath10 ) , consistent with the arguments given by markova et al./repolust et al . and the earlier findings by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this analysis is hampered by one severe restriction . since _",
    "all _ diagnostics employed have a @xmath8 dependence , only _ relative _ clumping factors could be derived , normalized to the values in the outermost , radio - emitting region .",
    "in other words , @xmath1(real ) @xmath26 @xmath1(radio ) , since until now the clumping in the radio emitting region is still unknown . only if @xmath14(radio )",
    "were unity , we would have @xmath1(real ) = @xmath1(radio ) .",
    "thus , the issue of absolute values for @xmath1  still remains unresolved .",
    "the major result of the investigation by @xcite ( see sect .  [ sigclump ] ) is displayed in fig .",
    "[ qest ] . in this figure , they have plotted , as a function of @xmath27  and luminosity class , the quantity @xmath28 for p@xmath21 , where angle brackets denote spatial averages . the quantity in the nominator has been measured from the pv lines , and the corresponding h@xmath10/radio mass - loss rates have been taken from the literature . if the winds were unclumped , @xmath29 would correspond to the average ionization fraction of p@xmath21 , whereas for clumped winds this quantity is modified by @xmath30 .",
    "fullerton et al .",
    "now argue that p@xmath21 should be a dominant ion at mid o - type , and in this case the derived clumping factor would be @xmath31 at @xmath27@xmath25 40,000  k. additionally , however , they report on test calculations performed with _ unclumped _ models which show that , on the contrary , p@xmath21 should become a dominant ion only below o7 .",
    "if this were true , fig .",
    "[ qest ] would imply @xmath32 in this temperature regime !",
    "since this is very unlikely , we have investigated the influence of clumping on the ionization fraction of p@xmath21 . due to the enhanced density inside the clumps ,",
    "stronger recombination is expected ( this is the _ indirect _ effect of clumping ) , which should change the picture ( see also @xcite ) . by means of our model atmosphere code fastwind @xcite and using the phosphorus model atom provided by @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated a sequence of clumped models with @xmath33 = const , i.e. , models which have identical @xmath8-diagnostics mass - loss rates . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pvifrac ] , increased clumping indeed shifts p@xmath21 as a dominant ion towards higher @xmath27 : for unclumped models , it is dominant at o8/7 , whereas for the largest clumping factors it dominates at o5 .    using these models then , the `` observed '' run of @xmath29 can be reproduced with highly clumped models ( @xmath14= 144 , see fig .  [ qest ] ) , for almost all luminosity classes and except for the very hottest temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "thus , our calculations confirm the hypothesis stated by fullerton et al .",
    ", i.e. , clumping _ is _ possible to explain the observations , and mass - loss rates might indeed be lower by factors of 10 or even more .",
    "as we have seen , there seems to be a ( physical ) difference between thinner and thicker winds . for thinner winds",
    ", there is a similar degree of clumping in the lower and outer wind , whereas for thicker winds clumping is stronger in the lower part .",
    "the actual mass - loss rates depend on the clumping in outer wind , which is still an unsolved issue .    _",
    "if _ the outer winds were unclumped , our results would be consistent with theoretical wlrs . in this case",
    "then , one would meet a severe dilemma with the results from the f(uv ) , which might hopefully be explained by additional effects from x - rays emitted due to clump - clump collisions @xcite .",
    "x - rays might also help to solve the problem encountered for pv at highest @xmath27 .    _ if _ , on the other hand , the ( f)uv values were correct , the outer wind must be significantly clumped , and the present match of `` observed '' and predicted wlr would indeed by only coincidental . this scenario would imply a number of severe problems , not only for radiation driven wind theory , but , most importantly , concerning the stellar evolution in the upper hrd and related topics .",
    "a possible way out of the latter problem has been suggested by n. smith ( this volume ) .",
