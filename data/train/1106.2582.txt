    "first , we set momentum to be conserved for the forward scattering process by choosing modes with azimuthal integer number of wavelengths along the circumference which obey @xmath6 ( e.g. 640=630 + 10 ) .",
    "we then vary the transverse order of the optical modes until @xmath8 is met so that energy is conserved as well @xcite .",
    "the mechanical mode that we calculate to fit here is a rayleigh - type @xcite surface - acoustic - wave ( saw ) @xcite as indicated by the fact that particles move elliptically in the equatorial plane and by the fact that upon increasing @xmath9 its speed asymptotically converges to the speed of a rayleigh saw on planar substrates as given by the analytical solution @xcite .",

    "_ mechanical vibration is stimulated _ by pumping the appropriate optical resonance of a microsphere using a tunable pump laser ( see methods , and fig .",

    "the vibration is measured via the beating of the pump and stokes modes on a photo detector .",
    "temporal sinusoidal dynamics are observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) , top right ) together with the corresponding spectral line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) , bottom right ) that we measure with an electrical spectrum analyzer .",
    "we then use an optical spectrum analyzer to verify that this beat indeed originates from a stokes line that is separated from the pump by the acoustical frequency .",
    "such correlation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thestory ] .",
    "additionally , a broadband spectrum analyzer is used to verify that four - wave mixing @xcite or raman lasing @xcite do not interfere with our measurements ( see methods ) .",
    "_ modal spectroscopy measurement _ is performed by slowly tuning the laser through optical resonances while recording the vibration frequencies excited through resonant trios similar to what was calculated in fig .",
    "[ fig : conventionalvsnew](d ) , but having different modal orders . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) , we observed mechanical modes ranging from 58 mhz - 1.4 ghz in a single sphere with the laser being tuned from 1520 - 1570 nm .",

    "threshold power depends on the coupling distance between taper and resonator as measured in fig .",
    "[ fig : thresholds](b ) and fitted to what is predicted by coupled - mode - theory analysis @xcite ( see methods ) . qualitatively and to a certain limit , this threshold lowering behavior is due to under - coupling reducing stokes transmission out of the cavity and leaving more of it inside the resonator to provide electrostrictive forces that excite vibration .    _ measuring the fine structure of the beat - note spectrum _",

    "[ fig : oscillator](a ) ) superimposed over a weak and wide lorentzian ( @xmath01 mhz , fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillator](b ) inset ) .",
    "the taller lorentzian originates from the width of the vibration gain spectrum that is expected to be @xmath02 khz wide @xcite . in resonators",
    "such 2 khz width is expected to narrow @xcite while being limited by the schawlow townes relation @xcite .",
    "the broad lorentzian originates from the optical resonance width .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the stimulated process gain here is @xmath01000x narrower than the optical resonance @xcite , in contrast with other processes @xcite where the relation is opposite .",
    "interestingly , linewidths like in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillator](a ) are related to both the mechanical quality factor and the optical quality factor .    _ the mechanical finesse _ is estimated by measuring the vibration decay time .",
    "although many additional factors interfere with this measurement , we attempted to perform a ring - down measurement by executing a fast scan of the pump wavelength .",
    "based on several such scans we estimate a phonon lifetime @xmath12 40 @xmath13 , implying a mechanical quality factor of approximately q  @xmath14  44000 ( finesse 900 ) for the 175 mhz mode shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillator](c ) .",
    "this is in comparison with material limited mechanical q  @xmath14  48000 @xcite . in our experiments ,",
    "the stokes mode is produced at efficiencies of up to 50% , with input power in the mw range .",
    "in this work we report for the first time on the experimental stimulated optical excitation of high finesse mechanical resonances in silica microspheres via forward brillouin scattering , indicating a new mechanism for studies in cavity optomechanics .",
    "the stimulated mechanical whispering gallery modes that are generated here are surface acoustic waves of the form typically excited using metal electrodes on piezoelectric substrates @xcite . in our case , however , the electrodes are virtual , and are written by light traveling with the mechanical mode .",
    "the dissipation suffered by phonons at these mechanical resonances is near the material limit , since they are whispering - gallery modes that propagate azimuthally just like the optical whispering gallery modes that excite them .",
    "such concentration of vibration at the sphere surface removes the necessity for notch supports and mechanical quarter - wavelength leakage isolators for the resonator , simplifying the mechanical design of the system .",
    "this is unlike the case of breathing modes @xcite that have propagation components in the direction of the mechanical supporting structures . additionally , the mechanism of electrostriction that supports the stimulated brillouin process , is common to all dielectrics inclusive of every amorphous or crystalline optical material . such brillouin amplification benefits from having the highest gain of all the optical nonlinearities @xcite . in silica , for instance , brillouin gain is more than two orders of magnitude higher than raman gain @xcite .",
    "microresonators that are presently at the core of many experiments in optics for enhancing electromagnetic fields @xcite are shown here to allow stimulated optical excitation of high finesse whispering gallery mechanical resonances .",
    "the narrow oscillation linewidth and the fact that the mechanical mode is concentrated to within one acoustical wavelength from the interface with the environment make this device attractive for sensing changes in the environment @xcite .",
    "further , these mechanical resonances see dissipation near the material - property limit , and are consequently very useful in oscillator applications as well .",
    "the mechanical modes that we experimentally observed were identified using 3d finite element modeling in comsol multiphysics @xcite .",
    "the existence of pairs of optical modes that satisfy phase match to excite these mechanical modes was confirmed using the numerical method described in @xcite .",
    "gross tuning of phase match was achieved by discretely changing the transverse order of the optical modes .",
    "fine tuning was then performed by modifying the ellipticity of the sphere till exact phase match was reached .",
    "shape and size of the calculated device were kept within the measurement error using our microscope .      our experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) ) consists of a silica microsphere resonator @xcite ( typical optical @xmath15 ) evanescently coupled to a telecom - wavelength laser ( @xmath01550 nm ) through a tapered optical fiber @xcite .",
    "we tune the pump laser to one of the optical resonances , and via the other end of the taper , measure the output of the partially transmitted pump along with the stokes mode that vibration scatters .",
    "optical spectrum analyzers are used to verify optical signals , while photodetectors provide the electrical beat signal .",
    "we emphasize that vibration is stimulated with a continuous - in - time single frequency laser , and that no external oscillator , controller , or feedback is used .",
    "the presence of a single stokes side - band to the optical pump is confirmed by optical spectrum analysis through a thorlabs sa200 - 14a tunable fabry - perot spectrum analyzer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thestory ] , top ) .",
    "we confirm that no optical lines other than the stimulated stokes line exist in our system by using a second osa ( advantest q8384 optical spectrum analyzer ) that overs a broad spectral range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thestory ] , bottom ) .",
    "also , as expected , the broad span osa can not resolve the two optical signals due to their close spacing .",
    "the relationship of coupling threshold to the coupling distance can be derived following the rate equations in @xcite . starting with the non - depleted pump approximation , a rate equation for the pump mode",
    "can be obtained @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the field amplitude of the pump mode , @xmath18 is the pump field amplitude in the coupling waveguide , @xmath19 is taper - sphere distance , @xmath20 is the taper - sphere distance - dependent coupling coefficient , @xmath21 is the intrinsic loss , and @xmath22 is the coupling loss . from here , the steady state expression , @xmath23 can be obtained .",

    "<S> stimulated brillouin interaction between sound and light , known to be the strongest optical nonlinearity common to all amorphous and crystalline dielectrics , has been widely studied in fibers and bulk materials but rarely in optical microresonators . the possibility of experimentally extending this principle to excite mechanical resonances in photonic microsystems , for sensing and frequency reference applications , has remained largely unexplored . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge lies in the fact that microresonators inherently have large free spectral range , while the phase matching considerations for the brillouin process require optical modes of nearby frequencies but with different wavevectors . </S>",
    "<S> we rely on high - order transverse optical modes to relax this limitation . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the experimental excitation of mechanical resonances ranging from 49 to 1400 mhz by using forward brillouin scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these natural mechanical resonances are excited in @xmath0100 m silica microspheres , and are of a surface - acoustic whispering - gallery type .    in the past , </S>",
    "<S> interaction of optical and mechanical resonances in cavities arising from modulation of the optical round - trip length has allowed excitation of emission lines which were similar to those observed in molecular studies , though only originating from device vibrations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extensive research has since been performed towards extending other atomic - level effects , such as cooling @xcite and quantum effects @xcite , to these optomechanical cavities . </S>",
    "<S> the ponderomotive forces used in these experiments @xcite have included centrifugal radiation pressure @xcite , scattering force @xcite , and gradient force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these experiments @xcite relied on the _ parametric _ optomechanical excitation of vibration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conventionalvsnew](a ) ) . however , there is also a different path for cavity optomechanics , of exciting vibration through a _ stimulated _ process ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conventionalvsnew](b ) ) , associated with a quantum event involving the emission of a phonon into the mechanical resonance , that we will use here . </S>",
    "<S> previously , the exploitation of stimulated brillouin back - scattering @xcite for stimulated photon - phonon emission has been deterred by either zero optical finesse in nanospheres @xcite , or by negligible mechanical finesse in microspheres @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , momentum conservation suggests @xcite that reversal of the scattering direction from backward @xcite to forward @xcite , allows the generation of low - frequency phonons that suffer much less material dissipation @xcite , resulting in high finesse acoustic modes . in the experiments that we report here </S>",
    "<S> , the stimulated process that excites the observed mechanical resonances is based on forward brillouin scattering @xcite of photons from acoustic phonons .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider an optically stimulated traveling acoustic resonance ( frequency @xmath1 ) on a microsphere device with an integer number of acoustical wavelengths ( @xmath2 ) around the circumference ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conventionalvsnew](d ) , right ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further consider that this resonance travels uni - directionally along the equator at the speed of sound ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conventionalvsnew](b ) , left ) . </S>",
    "<S> the process responsible for the generation of this resonance is as follows  the traveling mechanical mode photoelastically writes an optical grating that is capable of scattering pump light . since the mechanical mode recedes at the speed of sound , </S>",
    "<S> it doppler red - shifts the scattered light by the correct frequency to enter the stokes optical mode ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the remaining pump - mode light along with the doppler shifted stokes - mode light can electrostrictively excite vibration at the beat frequency of the two optical modes . </S>",
    "<S> if this optically induced stress also travels at the speed of sound , the process described by photoelastic scattering and electrostriction becomes self - sustaining . </S>",
    "<S> this intuitive phase - matching condition can be derived analytically by solving the coupled wave equations for mechanical and optical waves to reveal a synchronous solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solution reveals that the propagation constant of the optical pump @xmath4 ( related to azimuthal @xmath5 propagation ) must equal the sum of the propagation constants of the resulting stokes and acoustical modes ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this wavevector relation is associated with momentum conservation , as one pump photon is converted into a photon and phonon , whose combined momentum must equal that of the pump photon . </S>",
    "<S> this conservation consideration also suggests that low - rate vibrations that are forbidden in backward scattering @xcite processes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conventionalvsnew](c ) , left ) are allowable if forward scattering is utilized instead ( fig .  [ fig : conventionalvsnew](c ) , right ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is known that the material dissipation limit for phonons scales inversely with the square of frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that scaling mechanical frequency from 11000 mhz ( typical of backward scattering in silica ) to 50 mhz ( this work ) can potentially provide a 50000-fold reduction in dissipation , transforming the stimulated acoustical wave @xcite into a high finesse mechanical resonance . </S>",
    "<S> phase matching is challenging for forward scattering due to the requirement of having two optical modes with nearby frequencies but with propagation constants differing by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a degree of freedom that can help in achieving close frequencies for the @xmath4 , @xmath7 modes is to change the transverse order of the mode till the optical frequencies are properly separated , as described in @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate the excitation of acoustical modes of a silica microsphere by stimulated forward brillouin scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the actuation mechanism is experimentally verified through observation of the optical signatures of the process . </S>",
    "<S> we measure acoustical frequencies ranging from 49 mhz to 1400 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> we expect our technique for exciting surface modes to be relevant for applications in surface - wave sensors and in oscillators . </S>"
