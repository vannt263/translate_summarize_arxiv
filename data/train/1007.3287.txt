    "the last two decades have seen unprecedented experimental and theoretical activities involving cuprates which exhibit high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . even after this long period of research which has seen dramatic advances in experimental techniques and materials quality , as well as discovery of many unusual phenomena such as the ubiquitous pseudogap in underdoped cuprates @xcite and the ` strange metal ' phase above the superconducting transition temperature around optimal doping @xcite , there is no common , broadly accepted understanding yet about their origin .    motivated by the above , especially the increasing volume of sophisticated spectroscopic data on the cuprates ( such as those obtained from arpes  @xcite , stm  @xcite and raman  @xcite experiments ) , we propose and develop here , as well as in subsequent papers , a new phenomenological model for cuprate superconductivity that is analogous in form to the well - known ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory @xcite of superconductivity .",
    "the starting point of our description is the assumption that the free energy of a cuprate superconductor can be expressed as a functional solely of the complex pair amplitude . in the original continuum gl theory ,",
    "the free energy , expressed as a functional of the complex order parameter field @xmath19 , has the form @xmath20 . \\label{eq.continuumglfunctional}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form is justified near the actual superconducting transition where the magnitude of the order parameter is small , so that a low - order power series expansion in @xmath21 is adequate .",
    "further , @xmath21 is assumed to vary slowly with @xmath22 so that it suffices to keep only the @xmath23 term ; this is the case in conventional superconductors where the natural superconducting length scale ( also the coarse graining scale ) @xmath24 is large ( compared , say , to the fermi wavelength ) .",
    "after the advent of the microscopic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite theory of superconductivity , @xmath21 was identified by gorkov @xcite with the cooper pair amplitude , i.e. @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the operator which destroys ( creates ) an electron at @xmath22 with spin @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "gorkov also obtained the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 in terms of the electronic parameters of the metal .     in the @xmath33 plane and construction of the bond lattice out of the centers of the cu - o - cu bonds .",
    "the solid circles at @xmath34 ( blue ) represent the positions of cu lattice sites and @xmath35 ( magenta ) the positions of bond centre lattice sites .",
    "alternatively , we denote the bond centre lattice site between @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of equivalent planar spins , with @xmath40 representing the complex order parameter @xmath41 and antiferromagnetic ordering ( shown ) of spins translating into a @xmath16-wave symmetry gap ( long - range order).,height=226 ]    in our phenomenological description , we hypothesize that a free energy functional similar in structure to that of eq.([eq.continuumglfunctional ] ) , but defined on the square planar @xmath33 lattice , describes the properties of cuprate superconductors for a fairly wide range of hole doping ( @xmath10 ) and temperature ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "fig.[fig.bondlattice ] shows the square planar lattice schematically , and fig.[fig.phasediagram ] the region of the @xmath42 plane where our phenomenological description is assumed to be applicable .",
    "the free energy is assumed to be a functional of the complex spin - singlet pair amplitude @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nearest - neighbor sites of the square planar cu lattice and @xmath4 labels the ` bond - center lattice ' site located at the center of the bond between the lattice sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.bondlattice ] ) .",
    "the highly anisotropic cuprate superconductor is modeled as a weakly coupled stack of @xmath33 planes in which the superconductivity is believed to primarily reside and we ignore , as a first approximation , the inter - plane coupling .",
    "the free energy functional for a single @xmath33 plane is assumed to have the form    [ eq.functional ] @xmath43     and temperature @xmath11 plane ( entire shaded region ) where we assume the functional of eq . to be applicable .",
    "@xmath44 ( solid brown line ) and @xmath15 ( solid blue line ) are shown along with the experimental superconducting ( sc ) dome and antiferromagnetic ( af ) regime at very low hole doping .",
    "the two arcs shown by dotted lines denote regions where quantum fluctuation effects , as well as other low - energy degrees of freedom , such as electronic and spin plus their coupling with pair degrees of freedom , need to be explicitly included in the free energy functional .",
    "for instance , inclusion of quantum phase fluctuation effects in a minimal level leads to a @xmath15 curve in agreement with experiment ( see section  [ sec.tc]).,height=226 ]    a gorkov like interpretation of @xmath45 is that it is the average spin - singlet nearest - neighbor cooper pair amplitude , i.e. @xmath46 . the sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 are different because strong electron repulsion ( symbolized for example by the mott - hubbard @xmath47 ) disfavors on - site pairing , while the existence of large nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic spin - spin interaction in the parent cuprate is identically equivalent for spin-@xmath48 electrons to attraction between nearest - neighbor pairs ( i.e. @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 the electron spin and number operators respectively at the @xmath2-th site ) .",
    "this favors the formation of nearest - neighbor spin - singlet pairs .",
    "the first part @xmath52 of @xmath0 is the sum of identical independent terms each of which is a function of only the magnitude @xmath53 of the order parameter on the bond lattice site .",
    "is a simple form for it in the image of eq .",
    ", with @xmath7 and @xmath8 depending , in general , on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is a positive constant independent of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and choose @xmath54 to change sign along a straight line @xmath44 running from @xmath55 at @xmath56 to @xmath57 at @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.phasediagram ] ) . as a first approximation",
    ", this line can be identified with the pseudogap temperature @xmath14 because the magnitude of the local pair ampliitude , @xmath12 , can increase dramatically as the temperature crosses this line , so that @xmath7 changes from a positive to a negative value .",
    "the occurrence of superconductivity , characterized by a nonzero stiffness for long - wavelength phase fluctuations and the associated superconducting phase coherence , depends on the phase coupling term , eq .. if @xmath9 in eq .",
    "is taken to be proportional to @xmath10 , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath59 , as calculated in our theory , turns out to be proportional to @xmath10 for small values of it , in conformity with what is observed , e.g. the uemura correlation @xcite .",
    "also , if @xmath9 is taken to be positive , the transition is to a @xmath16-wave symmetry superconducting state ( see section  [ sec.glfunctional ] ) .",
    "we , therefore , make this choice .",
    "we emphasize that the assumed form of the functional and the dependence of the coefficients on @xmath10 and @xmath11 are purely phenomenological , guided by experimental results  the functional is not derived from a microscopic theory .",
    "the functional satisfies the usual symmetry and stability requirements : the absence of odd powers of @xmath60 ensures invariance of the free energy under a global change of phase , and the free energy is bounded below for the chosen positive @xmath8 . since @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ", it is readily seen that the free energy of eq.([eq.functional ] ) is similar in form to a discretized version of the gl functional of eq.([eq.continuumglfunctional ] ) .",
    "however , there are important differences between our phenomenological approach and the original gl theory ",
    "these differences are discussed in detail in section  [ sec.glfunctional ] .",
    "the main objective of our study is to investigate whether the free energy functional defined above provides a good description of experimental results over a wide range of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . to this end , we have carried out several investigations of the thermodynamic behavior of a system whose equilibrium properties are given by canonical ( thermal ) averages with the functional of eq.([eq.functional ] ) playing the role of the ` hamiltonian ' or energy function .",
    "these calculations have been performed at several levels of sophistication .",
    "we first used simple single - site mean - field theory to obtain qualitative information about the behavior of the system over a wide range of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we also used cluster mean - field theory to obtain more accurate estimates of the superconducting transition temperature as a function of doping .",
    "we used numerical minimization of the free energy to obtain exact results for the properties of the system and the structure of vortices at zero temperature .",
    "we also used extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to obtain exact ( modulo finite - size effects ) information about the thermodynamic behavior of the system at finite temperatures . since the free energy of eq.([eq.functional ] ) may be viewed as the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional xy model with fluctuations in the magnitudes of the ` spins ' ( see section  [ sec.glfunctional ] for the details of this analogy ) , we made use of well - known results about the behavior of the xy model in two dimensions in the analysis of the data obtained from our mc simulations .",
    "finally , we extended our free energy functional to include quantum phase fluctuations ( see section  [ sec.tc ] ) in order to study the effects of these fluctuations on the transition temperature , and included coupling of the pair degrees of freedom to electrons ( see section  [ sec.spectraldensity ] ) to study the spectral properties of electrons measured in arpes experiments .",
    "simple , physically motivated , approximate analytic methods were used in these studies .",
    "the main results obtained from these extensive analytic and numerical calculations are summarized below .    as a starting point",
    ", we calculate the superconducting transition temperature @xmath15 and the average magnitude of the local pair amplitude , @xmath63 , using single - site mean - field theory for the model of eq .. we show that this approximation leads to general features of the @xmath64 phase diagram in agreement with experiment .",
    "in particular , we find a phase coherent superconducting state with @xmath16-wave symmetry below a parabolic @xmath15 dome and a phase incoherent state with a perceptible local gap that persists up to a temperature around @xmath44 .",
    "further , effects of thermal fluctuations beyond the mean - field level are captured via mc simulations of the model of eq . for a finite two - dimensional lattice .",
    "section [ sec.tc ] describes the results for @xmath15 obtained from these simulations .",
    "the actual values of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 used in these calculations are discussed in section [ sec.glfunctional ] .",
    "the superfluid stiffness @xmath17 ( a quantity measured e.g. via the penetration depth ) is calculated in section [ sec.superfluiddensity ] .",
    "its doping and temperature dependence compare well with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the thermally averaged local gap @xmath65 is obtained in section  [ sec.gap ] where we calculate the temperature @xmath13 corresponding to the maximum slope of this quantity with and without the @xmath9 term .",
    "this temperature provides a measure of the pseudogap temperature @xmath14 .",
    "we use these results to remark on contrasting scenarios @xcite proposed for the doping dependence of the pseudogap .",
    "we find that there is a contribution to @xmath66 that ` turns on ' at @xmath15 , the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "this is obviously connected with persistent observations of two different kinds of energy gaps in several experiments @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the ratio @xmath67 which is observed to be generally much larger than the bcs value of about 4 over a wide range of @xmath10 @xcite , and to vary from system to system within the cuprate family for the same @xmath10 .",
    "our results rationalize this behavior , which is expected here since the origins of @xmath68 and @xmath59 are different",
    ".    the contribution of the pair degrees of freedom to thermal properties , such as the specific heat @xmath69 , can be obtained from the free energy functional of eq .. we briefly report in section [ sec.specificheat ] our calculation of @xmath69 ( details are given in a subsequent paper @xcite ) , and find that there are two peaks @xcite in it , a sharp one connected with @xmath59 ( ordering of the phase of @xmath60 ) and a relatively broad one ( ` hump ' ) linked to @xmath70 ( rapid growth of the magnitude of @xmath60 ) .",
    "the former is specially sensitive to the presence of a magnetic field , as we find in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "vortices , which are topological singularities in phase , are naturally explored in our approach @xcite .",
    "we use the functional of eq . to find @xmath53 and @xmath71 at different sites @xmath4 for a @xmath72 vortex",
    "whose core is at the center of a square plaquette of cu lattice sites ( section [ sec.vortex ] ) .",
    "we find that the vortex changes character from being primarily a phase or josephson vortex for small @xmath10 to a more bcs - like vortex with a large diminution in the magnitude @xmath53 as one approaches the vortex core for large @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite describes these results in greater detail .",
    "experimental information about the pair field @xmath60 and its correlations is not obtained directly , but from its coupling to electrons ( e.g. arpes @xcite and stm @xcite ) , photons ( e.g. raman scattering @xcite and light absorption @xcite ) and neutrons @xcite .",
    "we therefore develop a theory for the coupling of electrons near the fermi energy with @xmath60 and outline it in section [ sec.spectraldensity ] .",
    "a separate paper @xcite describes this approach in detail as well as the results ( e.g. fermi arcs that are ubiquitous above @xmath59 , and the pseudogap for various momentum regions of the fermi surface , especially the antinodal region ) which compare very well with the results of recent arpes measurements .",
    "we present here the results for the antinodal pseudogap filling temperature @xmath73 and compare it with the other estimate of the pseudogap temperature , @xmath13 , obtained in section  [ sec.gap ] .",
    "the results summarized above establish that the simple free energy functional proposed here provides a consistent and qualitatively correct ( quantitative in some cases ) description of a variery of experimentally observed properties of cuprate superconductors over a wide range of temperature @xmath11 and hole concentration @xmath10 .",
    "this is the main conclusion of our study .",
    "section [ sec.discussion ] discusses certain generalizations , applications and limitations of the approach used in our study .",
    "appendices [ appendix.mft ] , [ appendix.selfenergy ] and [ appendix.xymodel ] describe some technical details of the calculations .",
    "as noted above , the free energy functional used in our study is phenomenological in nature with experimentally inspired coefficients .",
    "we have deliberately kept it as simple as possible , without violating basic requirements of symmetry and stability .",
    "the form of the functional of eq .",
    "is analogous to that used in conventional gl theory .",
    "however , our approach is different from the gl theory in several ways .",
    "the form of the free energy functional used in the gl theory of supercoductivity and in similar theories of other continuous phase transitions @xcite can be justified only if the temperature is close to the transition temperature .",
    "this approach , therefore , is expected to yield quantitatively correct results only in the vicinity of the superconducting transition .",
    "this regime of validity is ordained by the requirement of smallness and slow spatial variation of the order parameter . our use of the simple , gl - like functional of eq . over a broad @xmath42 region",
    "can not be justified from similar considerations : the validity of our approach can only be judged a posteriori by comparing its consequences with experiments .",
    "hence , we have calculated a variety of experimentally measurable quantities using the functional of eq . and compared the results with those of experiments .",
    "as discussed in detail in subsequent sections , we find qualitative ( and quantitative in some cases ) agreement between the theoretical and experimental results for a wide variety of properties of cuprate superconductors .",
    "this establishes the usefulness of our phenomenological approach in describing the properties of cuprate superconductors over a wide range of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "another important difference between our approach and conventional gl theory is that the free energy functional we consider is not coarse - grained in the gl sense .",
    "we believe that this is natural because all cuprate superconductors are characterized by short intrinsic pairing length scales or coarse - graining lengths ( @xmath74 in the cuprates rather than the value of @xmath75 for ` conventional ' pure superconductors ) .",
    "we thus use a ` nearest - neighbor ' coupling of the pair amplitudes defined at the sites of the atomic bond lattice in the second term of our functional ( eq.([eq.functional1 ] ) ) . another difference between the functional used in our study and that of conventional gl theory is that the sign of the coupling constant @xmath9 in eq.([eq.functional1 ] ) is taken to be _ positive _ , so that the pair amplitudes at nearest - neighbor sites of the bond - center lattice have a phase difference of @xmath76 in the ground state .",
    "this difference in sign between the pair amplitudes on the ` horizontal ' ( in the @xmath10-direction ) and vertical ( @xmath77-direction ) bonds of the cu lattice corresponds to the superconducting state having @xmath16-wave symmetry .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental fact that the superconducting gap @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath79 , which arises in our description from a combination of nearest - neighbor cooper pairs with relative phases as mentioned above .",
    "some of the methods of calculation used in our study are also different from that in the conventional gl theory of superconductivity in which physical properties are calculated using simple mean field theory .",
    "the mean - field results are expected to be valid if the temperature is outside the so - called critical region  @xcite around the transition temperature where the effects of fluctuations , not included in a mean - field analysis , are important . for conventional superconductors with long coherence lengths ,",
    "the width of the critical region is very small , so that mean field theory provides a good description of most of the experimentally observed behavior .",
    "this , however , is not the case for cuprate superconductors with very short coherence lengths and for our model of cuprate superconductivity . for this reason",
    ", we have to go beyond mean field theory ( which provides a qualitatively correct , but not quantitative description of the general behavior ) and use other methods ( such as mc simulations ) to obtain accurate results for the thermodynamic behavior of our model .",
    "a natural description of the pair amplitude @xmath60 is as a planar spin of length @xmath53 pointing in a direction that makes an angle @xmath71 with a fixed axis .",
    "the thermal ( boltzmann ) probability of the length distribution is given primarily by @xmath80 of eq.([eq.functional0 ] ) and the term in eq.([eq.functional1 ] ) may be thought of as the coupling between such ` spins ' .",
    "the temperature @xmath14 can be identified roughly as that at which the ` spin ' at each bond lattice site acquires a sizable length locally without any global ordering of the angles , whereas the ` antiferromagnetic ' ( @xmath81 ) nearest - neighbor interaction leads to global order ( @xmath16-wave superconductivity ) setting in at @xmath59 .",
    "the two temperatures are well separated for small @xmath10 because @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are so chosen that @xmath82 .",
    "the region between @xmath70 and @xmath59 is the pseudogap regime where in the spin language , antiferromagnetic short - range correlations grow with decreasing temperature , its length scale diverging at @xmath59 .",
    "there is considerable experimental evidence for this view @xcite , though there is also the alternative view that @xmath14 is associated with a new long - range order , e.g. @xmath16-density wave ( ddw ) @xcite or time reversal symmetry breaking circulating currents @xcite .",
    "the bcs theory and conventional gl theory in which the ` spin ' formation and ordering temperatures are the same are limiting cases of this scenario .",
    "something like this is expected to happen in cuprates near @xmath83 ( fig.[fig.phasediagram ] ) as also follows from our functional .",
    "the state below @xmath59 has nonzero order parameter @xmath84 for a system above two dimensions , and is a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) @xcite bound vortex state with quasi long range order in two dimensions , in which case @xmath59 is identified with the vortex unbinding temperature @xmath85 . in the former case , the order parameter is the sublattice magnetization @xmath86 with a @xmath87-dependent gap @xmath88 .",
    "the interlayer coupling can be described , a la lawrence and doniach @xcite , by adding say a nearest - neighbor coupling between ` spins ' on different layers to our functional in eq .. since this is in practice relatively small ( the measured anisotropy ratio in bi2212 is about 100 , for example @xcite ) , it makes very little difference quantitatively to most of our estimates which generally neglect this coupling .",
    "for instance @xmath59 calculated by estimating the bkt transition temperature ( @xmath85 ) from mc simulation of the two - dimensional model of eq .",
    "( see section [ sec.tc ] ) is expected to be very close to the actual transition temperature in the anisotropic 3d model with such small interlayer coupling .    a conventional gl theory of cuprate superconductivity would involve a functional similar to that in eq.([eq.continuumglfunctional ] ) ( but with additional terms allowed by symmetry ) with @xmath89 the @xmath16-wave superconducting order parameter , and the coefficient so chosen that a mean - field treatment of the free energy leads to a dome - shaped @xmath15 curve similar to that found in experiments .",
    "however , a mean - field treatment and the conclusions obtained from it would not be reliable because of the smallness of the superconducting coherence length in the cuprates and consequent large fluctuation effects .",
    "in particular , the pseudogap temperature @xmath70 ( which is much larger than @xmath59 for small @xmath10 , and goes to @xmath59 as @xmath10 increases ) would be absent in such a theory .",
    "by contrast , we assume here that the basic low - energy cooper pair degree of freedom in the cuprates is the bond pair , give a physical meaning to @xmath70 as a pair magnitude crossover temperature , and describe the regime between @xmath70 and @xmath59 as one in which the correlation length associated with superconducting fluctuations of @xmath16-wave symmetry grows and diverges at @xmath59",
    ". the effect of these fluctuations is found to be crucial for many physical properties , e.g. the fermi arc phenomenon , and the filling of the antinodal pseudogap as @xmath11 rises to @xmath70 .",
    "the superconducting order with @xmath16-wave symmetry that sets in at @xmath59 is an emergent collective effect , arising from the short - range @xmath90 interaction , much as long - range neel order arises from an antiferromagentic coupling between nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "gl theories for cuprates have been proposed by a large number of authors , arising either out of a particular model for electronic behavior and often coupled with the assumption of a particular ` glue ' for binding electrons into pairs @xcite , or out of lattice symmetry considerations @xcite .",
    "the functional in eq . is consistent with square lattice symmetry and , in principle , does not assume any particular electronic approach ( weak coupling or strong correlation , for example ) or a mechanism for the ` glue ' .",
    "however , some of the properties of the coefficients are natural in a strong electron correlation framework . for example , mobile holes in such a system can cause a transition between a state in which there is a cooper pair in the @xmath10 directed @xmath91 bond ( fig.[fig.bondlattice ] ) to one in which the cooper pair is in an otherwise identical but @xmath77 directed bond @xmath92 nearest to it ( or vice versa ) , thus leading to a nonzero term @xmath93 in eq .. this is probably connected with the observed  @xcite empirical correlation between @xmath59 and the diagonal or next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude of electrons in the cu lattice .",
    "the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are chosen to be consistent with experiments .",
    "specifically , the coefficients are as follows :    [ eq.glparameters ] @xmath94 e^{t / t_p},\\label{eq.a}\\\\ b&=&b_0t_0 , \\label{eq.b}\\\\ c(x)&=&xc_0t_0 , \\label{eq.c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we require @xmath53 to have dimensions of energy @xmath95 $ ] ( or temperature for boltzmann constant @xmath96 ) and hence @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 have dimensions of @xmath95^{-2}$ ] , @xmath95^{-4}$ ] and @xmath95^{-2}$ ] respectively .",
    "they are rewritten in terms of @xmath100 as well as three dimensionless parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 so that @xmath0 carries dimension of energy as well .",
    "we thus have , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we choose @xmath102 and @xmath103 to have values of order unity and fix them for different hole doped cuprates by comparing @xmath107 , @xmath14 and @xmath108 obtained from the theory with experiments ( see below for details ) .",
    "the two temperature dependent parts of @xmath7 as given above arise as follows .",
    "the part @xmath109 $ ] reflects our identification of the zero of @xmath54 with the pseudogap temperature and the experimental observation that the pseudogap region extends downwards nearly linearly from @xmath110 at @xmath56 to @xmath57 for @xmath58 . the relation between this straight line @xmath44 , the experimental @xmath14 and the related quantities @xmath111 ( obtained from a maximum slope criterion , section [ sec.gap ] ) as well as @xmath73 ( obtained from the antinodal gap filling criterion for the electron spectral function , section [ sec.spectraldensity ] )",

    "such a suppression is natural in a degenerate fermi system ; the relevant local electron pair susceptibility is rather small above the pair binding temperature and below the degeneracy temperature .",

    "<S> we propose and develop here a phenomenological ginzburg - landau - like theory of cuprate high - temperature superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of a cuprate superconductor is expressed as a functional @xmath0 of the complex spin - singlet pair amplitude @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nearest - neighbor sites of the square planar cu lattice in which the superconductivity is believed to primarily reside and @xmath4 labels the site located at the center of the bond between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the system is modeled as a weakly coupled stack of such planes . </S>",
    "<S> we hypothesize a simple form , @xmath5=\\sum_m ( a\\delta_m^2 + ( b/2 ) \\delta_m^4)+c\\sum_{<mn > } \\delta_m\\delta_n \\cos(\\phi_m-\\phi_n)$ ] , for the functional , where @xmath4 and @xmath6 are nearest - neighbor sites on the bond - center lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this form is analogous to the original continuum ginzburg - landau free energy functional ; the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are determined from comparison with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of analytic approximations , numerical minimization and monte carlo simulations is used to work out a number of consequences of the proposed functional for specific choices of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 as functions of hole density @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> there can be a rapid crossover of @xmath12 from small to large values as @xmath7 changes sign from positive to negative on lowering @xmath11 ; this crossover temperatures @xmath13 is identified with the observed pseudogap temperature @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic superconducting phase - coherence transition occurs at a lower temperature @xmath15 , and describes superconductivity with @xmath16-wave symmetry for positive @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath15 curve has the observed parabolic shape . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the superfluid density @xmath17 , the local gap magnitude @xmath12 , the specific heat @xmath18 ( with and without a magnetic field ) as well as vortex properties , all obtained using the proposed functional , are compared successfully with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the electron spectral density as influenced by the coupling between the electrons and the correlation function of the pair amplitude calculated from the functional and compare the results successfully with the electronic spectrum measured through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . for the specific heat , vortex structure and electron spectral density , </S>",
    "<S> only some of the final results are reported here ; the details are presented in subsequent papers . </S>"
