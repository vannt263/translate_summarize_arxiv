    "although supersymmetry ( susy ) is a key concept in the physics of elementary particles and fields , it is not supported ( up to now ) by experimental evidences .",
    "so , any realistic model involving susy must include some mechanism of breakdown .",
    "many different mechanisms of breakdown have been considered in the literature .",
    "for instance , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with explicit soft susy breaking operators has been suggested as a way of solving the scale of grand unification and the hierarchy problems @xcite .",
    "the breakdown due to instanton solutions @xcite , its connection with @xmath1-symmetry breaking @xcite and with the witten index @xcite have also been intensely investigated along the years . yet ,",
    "several variations or extensions of the models of oraifeartaigh and of fayet - iliopoulos @xcite , which present spontaneous susy breaking , have been considered and more recently , theories which exhibit metastable vacua with broken susy @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "another interesting question is whether a purely perturbative mechanism , i.e. , a dynamical symmetry breaking induced by radiative corrections can be achieved ( in this case , a mass scale would be dynamically generated ) .    in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions",
    "this possibility is ruled out by nonrenormalization theorems @xcite . on the other hand , in @xmath3 dimensions such restriction",
    "( at least for @xmath0 susy ) does not exist @xcite .",
    "the usual way of investigating the vacuum structure in quantum field theory involves the calculation of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "recently the two - loop effective potential for the three - dimensional @xmath4 wess  zumino ( wz ) model was evaluated in ref .",
    "for the case @xmath0 , the effective potential for the wz model and massless electrodynamics up to one - loop were first calculated in @xcite long ago . in both models , that author showed that neither susy nor the gauge invariance are broken by radiative corrections up to one loop order .",
    "nevertheless , in @xmath3 dimensions , terms involving logarithms of the classical fields only appear in two or more loops .",
    "since these logarithmic contributions have a crucial role in the dynamical symmetry breakdown , the calculations must be carried up at least to two loops .    in the component field formalism the two - loop effective potential of the wz model was evaluated off - shell and on - shell in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is reported a problem with the renormalization of the effective potential : a divergent term which can not be absorbed by rescaling of the classical lagrangian appears . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , difficulties with the renormalization are not found , but it is claimed that susy is broken and a dynamical mass generation takes place . in that paper , however , the evaluation of the effective potential did not take into account radiative corrections to the equation of motion of the auxiliary field @xcite .",
    "these facts lead us to conclude that the renormalization and the vacuum structure to the three - dimensional wz model are issues not yet satisfactorily answered .",
    "the present work aims to calculate the two - loop effective potential of the wz model by using the superfield formulation .",
    "we claim that the renormalization of the effective potential with dimensional reduction regularization is achieved in the usual way .",
    "moreover , we show that susy is not broken and dynamical generation of mass is not perturbatively consistent .",
    "we have also determined the beta function associated with the fourfold self - interaction and verified that it agrees with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is obtained by direct calculation of the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green s functions in components fields .",
