    "to extract precise information from @xmath9 mixing measurements the ratio of  leptonic decay constants , \" @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons must be well known @xcite . indeed , measurement of @xmath13 mixing by cdf @xcite has pointed out the urgent need for precise numbers .",
    "the @xmath10 have been calculated theoretically .",
    "the most promising of these calculations are based on lattice - gauge theory that include the light quark loops @xcite . in order to ensure that these theories can adequately predict @xmath14 it is critical to check the analogous ratio from charm decays @xmath15 .",
    "we have previously measured @xmath16 @xcite .    in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the @xmath17 meson decays purely leptonically , via annihilation through a virtual @xmath18 .",
    "the decay width is given by @xcite @xmath19\\label{eq : equ_rate } \\times\\left(1-{m_{\\ell^+}^2\\over m_{d_s^+}^2}\\right)^2 \\left|v_{cs}\\right|^2~ , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the @xmath1 and @xmath22 masses , @xmath23 is a ckm element equal to 0.9737 , and @xmath24 is the fermi constant .",
    "new physics can affect the expected widths ; any undiscovered charged bosons would interfere with the sm @xmath18 @xcite",
    ". these effects may be difficult to ascertain , since they would simply change the value of @xmath10 extracted using eq .",
    "we can , however , measure the ratio of decay rates to different leptons , and the predictions then are fixed only by well - known masses .",
    "for example , for @xmath25 to @xmath26 the predicted ratio is 9.72 ; any deviation would be a manifestation of new physics manifestly violating lepton universality @xcite .",
    "in this study data collected in @xmath27 collisions using the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and recorded near 4.170 gev . here the cross - section for @xmath28+@xmath29 is @xmath301 nb .",
    "we fully reconstruct one @xmath17 as a  tag , \" and examine the properties of the other . in this paper",
    "we designate the tag as a @xmath31 and examine the leptonic decays of the @xmath22 , though in reality we use both charges . for studies with @xmath22 decaying into a @xmath26 or @xmath25 ; @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) we use 314 pb@xmath5 of data ; for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) we use 195 pb @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis for @xmath26 and @xmath33 has already been published @xcite . in summary tags",
    "are created from several modes including @xmath36 ( 13871 events ) , @xmath37 ( 3122 ) , @xmath38 ( 1609 ) , @xmath39 ( 1196 ) , @xmath40 ( 1678 ) , @xmath41 ( 3654 ) , @xmath42 ( 2030 ) and @xmath43 ( 4142 ) , a total of 31302 tags .",
    "when the tagging @xmath44 from the @xmath45 decay is also required , the number of tags is reduced to 18645 .",
    "candidate @xmath46 events are searched for by selecting events with only a single extra track with opposite sign of charge to the tag ; we also require that there not be an extra neutral energy cluster in excess of 300 mev .",
    "since here we are searching for events where there is a single missing neutrino , the missing mass squared , mm@xmath47 , evaluated by taking into account the seen @xmath2 , @xmath31 , and the @xmath44 should peak at zero , and is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the energy ( momentum ) of the candidate muon track .",
    "we also make use of a set of kinematical constraints and fit the mm@xmath47 for each @xmath44 candidate to two hypotheses one of which is that the @xmath31 tag is the daughter of a @xmath51 and the other that the @xmath52 decays into @xmath53 , with the @xmath22 subsequently decaying into @xmath26 . the hypothesis with the lowest @xmath54 is kept .",
    "if there is more than one @xmath44 candidate in an event we choose only the lowest @xmath54 choice among all the candidates and hypotheses .",
    "the kinematical constraints are the total momentum and energy , the energy of the either the @xmath55 or the @xmath17 , the appropriate @xmath56 mass difference and the invariant mass of the @xmath17 tag decay products .",
    "this gives us a total of 7 constraints .",
    "the missing neutrino four - vector needs to be determined , so we are left with a three - constraint fit .",
    "we preform a standard iterative fit minimizing @xmath54 .",
    "as we do not want to be subject to systematic uncertainties that depend on understanding the absolute scale of the errors , we do not make a @xmath54 cut , but simply choose the photon and the decay sequence in each event with the minimum @xmath54 .",
    "we consider three separate cases : ( i ) the track deposits @xmath57  300 mev in the calorimeter , characteristic of a non - interacting @xmath58 or a @xmath2 ; ( ii ) the track deposits @xmath59  300 mev in the calorimeter , characteristic of an interacting @xmath58 ; ( iii ) the track satisfies our @xmath60 selection criteria @xcite .",
    "then we separately study the mm@xmath47 distributions for these three cases .",
    "the separation between @xmath2 and @xmath58 is not unique .",
    "case ( i ) contains 99% of the @xmath2 but also 60% of the @xmath58 , while case ( ii ) includes 1% of the @xmath2 and 40% of the @xmath58 @xcite .",
