    "much research has been devoted to the statistical physics of complex systems with game theoretic interactions recently .",
    "one motivation are economic systems composed of a large number of agents with simple local interactions giving rise to complex global structures and dynamics @xcite . in particular",
    ", the problem of stability and uniqueness of equilibria in economic systems has been readdressed in the context of the aggregate behavior of individual agents @xcite .",
    "game theory @xcite and the theory of evolutionary games @xcite provide a sufficient framework for modeling individual interactions whereas spatial structures has to be taken into account to tackle co - evolutionary dynamics of real - world systems @xcite .    here",
    ", we will consider random networks of agents which face a social dilemma or , in physical terms , a frustrated interaction .",
    "imagine a situation where each player can take two actions , say _ cooperating _ or _",
    "defecting_. the optimal global outcome would be achieved by all players cooperating .",
    "but an individual player can gain much more when exploiting the cooperators by defecting .",
    "such a situation is called a social dilemma or a frustrated interaction .",
    "the central question is how social order is possible and how cooperative behavior can emerge .",
    "examples for such spatially extended dilemmas are biological networks , where connected plants may or may not decide to share resources @xcite , the analysis of internet congestion @xcite , models for economic communication @xcite , and , of course , many sociological problems from conflict research to public transportation @xcite .",
    "a simple model system is given by the iterated prisoner s dilemma ( ipd ) @xcite with co - evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game is probably the most prominent example of a basic model for the emergence of cooperative behavior in social , economic , and biological systems .",
    "it provides a frustrated two - particle interaction and has been extensively studied by physicists , economists , biologists , and mathematicians .",
    "a spatially extended prisoner s dilemma was first proposed by axelrod who concluded that territoriality strongly influences the evolution of cooperation @xcite .",
    "extensive work on the spatial prisoner s dilemma started in 1992 when nowak and may explored a cellular automaton based on this game on regular lattices .",
    "they and others found complex spatiotemporal dynamics and emergence of cooperation for strategy spaces confined to the strategies _ defecting _ and _ cooperating _ @xcite .",
    "for the prisoner s dilemma on lattices and strategy spaces confined to only _ cooperating _ and _ defecting _ ( and tit - for - tat in @xcite ) , methods from theoretical physics , as monte - carlo simulations , percolation theory , the theory of ( nonequilibrium ) phase transitions , and the concept of self - organized criticality , were used to understand why cooperators or defectors dominate or coexist in the system @xcite .",
    "lindgren and nordahl introduced players which act erroneously sometimes , allowing a complex evolution of strategies in an unbounded strategy space @xcite .",
    "others found that the limitation of a player s memory to the last encounter , which translates to a bounded strategy space , does not provide a significant drawback for the players @xcite .",
    "evolutionary games on networks , again with only two strategies , have been studied to ask questions how spatial organization influences the transition from defecting to cooperating @xcite and how the players themselves may influence the network topology @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will study the prisoner s dilemma on a network with a larger but bounded strategy space and co - evolutionary dynamics that lead to nash equilibria as stationary states .",
    "it will be shown both numerically and theoretically that payoff matrix , strategy space , and topology are crucial to answer the question which equilibria will occur and how stable they are . in particular , critical avalanches of mutations are observed for such games and will be explained in detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_ipd ] ,",
    "the spatially extended iterated prisoner s dilemma is described as well as its co - evolutionary dynamics .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec_ava ] by numerical investigations of avalanche dynamics showing three distinct regimes due to changes in payoff matrix and topology .",
    "the observed nash equilibria are described and explained in section [ sec_equ ] which enables us to understand the critical value of the control parameter of the payoff matrix .",
    "a confined branching process is introduced in section [ sec_bra ] clarifying the relaxation mechanism and the emergence of scale - free behavior .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec_con ] .",
    "we start with a network with @xmath0 players as nodes where each player plays an iterated prisoner s dilemma game against each of its neighbors .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma is a two - person game with two possible actions in each encounter .",
    "the payoff matrix of the first player for the two strategies _ cooperating _ and _ defecting _ ( denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) is given by @xmath3 with the entries @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the payoff of player 1 if player 1 plays strategy @xmath6 and player 2 plays @xmath7 .",
    "the game is symmetric , i.e.  @xmath8 . therefore , the corresponding payoff matrix of the second player is the transpose of the first player s matrix .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game in general is defined by the relations @xmath9 hence , in one encounter of the prisoner s dilemma , defecting is the strategy that yields the best payoff regardless of the opponent s strategy .",
    "this is no longer the case in the iterated game where mutual cooperation is more favorable than both players defecting or switching between defecting and cooperating .",
    "that is the reason why this system is a frustrated system . in each encounter , defecting would maximize a player s payoff .",
    "but in the long run , when players will anticipate each other s action , cooperation will in general do much better .      let us further specify the strategy space and payoff function of the spatial game .",
    "a strategy is viewed as a mapping of an agent s `` knowledge '' to an `` action '' .",
    "`` knowledge '' of an agent is given by the previous moves the agent can take into account to decide which action it will take next .",
    "we define the memory length @xmath10 of a player as the number of these previous moves and confine the memory of the agents to @xmath11 , i.e.  an agent remembers only its opponent player s last action .",
    "if one player encounters another player it has to decide on its first move without any information about the opponent . accordingly , the opening move is part of the strategy , too , which can be represented as a lookup table or a binary string ( tab .",
    "[ lookup - table ] ) .",
    "the finite number of moves of one encounter is not known by any agent . in the course of the game , one player has to play against each of its neighbors on the network .",
    "thereafter , its payoff is given by the average payoff per move and neighbor .",
    ".[lookup - table ] representation of the strategy of one agent with memory @xmath11 ( 0 : defection , 1 : cooperation ) .",
    "the agent determined by the above strategy is an unconditioned cooperator .",
    "it cooperates no matter whether its opponent has cooperated or defected in the last move . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     mean - field approaches can be applied successfully to explain the parameter @xmath12 of the confined branching process in the subcritical and critical regime ( tab .",
    "[ tab_mf ] ) . to calculate a mean - field approximation @xmath13 of the branching parameter , the transition probabilities of a mutated agent s neighbors",
    "are determined using a random neighborhood for both the player and its neighbors .",
    "the structure of the game is taken into account only by assuming that the stable strategies are absorbing states .",
    "a second approach is to average the transition probabilities over game realizations numerically , yielding @xmath14 .",
    "both values , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , agree well with the parameter @xmath12 obtained from the avalanche distributions of the subcritical and critical regime .",
    "this corresponds to the explanation that this transition occurs solely because of the change in the degeneracy of the cooperative macrostate at the critical value @xmath15 .",
    "the supercritical case is not matched by the mean - field approaches which may be due to the fact that here the dynamics are governed by local effects , i.e.  the competitive growth at the boundaries between cooperative and defective domains .",
    "the dynamics on a ring topology can be explained by a similar mean - field approach , too , if one assumes that the effective maximal number of a player s descendants is approximately two and not three .",
    "this reduction of potential progeny is caused by the strong overlap of the neighborhoods in this regular lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bran ] b ) .",
    "although the definition of the confined galton - watson process is quite intuitive and simple , its analytical treatment is not .",
    "the reason is that mutation events has become dependent on each other .",
    "two mutations can affect the same site in the next generation ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bran ] b ) leading to dependent recursive equations ( [ eq_px1 ] , [ eq_px2 ] ) for the mutation probability . with the simplification that the @xmath16 mutated sites of generation @xmath17 are randomly distributed over the network",
    ", one can shed some light on the critical behavior of the confined branching process .",
    "the conditional expectations of the number of mutated players are with this assumption @xmath18 with @xmath19.\\ ] ] if @xmath20 and @xmath21 the confined process approximately is a martingale for all values of @xmath16 and should show critical behavior . for @xmath22 the avalanche dynamics",
    "are subcritical as the process becomes a supermartingale . with @xmath23 obviously resulting in supercritical dynamics ,",
    "the remaining case of interest is @xmath21 . in the event of highly connected networks with @xmath24",
    "the correction @xmath25 is of the order @xmath26 suppressing large avalanches .",
    "thus critical avalanche dynamics are expected only for sparsely connected networks , for too strong dependencies of mutation events lead to either subcritical or supercritical distributions of avalanche sizes .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a spatially extended prisoner s dilemma game with co - evolutionary dynamics that lead to nash equilibria as stationary states .",
    "we have shown that critical avalanche dynamics are characteristic for a broad range of these games .",
    "the observed intermittent evolution with sudden avalanches of activity is reminiscent of self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "depending on the payoff matrix , subcritical , critical , and supercritical regimes can be observed . calculating the nash equilibria and introducing a confined branching process",
    ", we were able to quantitatively explain the critical value of the control parameter , i.e.  the temptation to defect , and the avalanche distributions .",
    "therefore , investigations on the spatially extended prisoner s dilemma , which has become a widely used toy model for the emergence of cooperation , have to take into account the stability of possible equilibria depending on chosen payoff matrix , strategy space , and topology .",
    "complex behavior should only be found for subcritical or critical dynamics whereas in the supercritical regime small perturbations will totally mix up the whole system preventing the evolution of local structures .",
    "the results on the stability of the nash equilibria and their connection to evolutionarily stable states indicate that the concept of equilibrium , originating from classical mechanics and brought into the fields of game theory and evolution @xcite , has to be further specified to take into account co - evolution on networks and other spatial structures .",
