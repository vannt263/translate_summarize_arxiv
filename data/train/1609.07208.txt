    "collinear emission has been obtained in @xcite via the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resummation , where the perturbative calculation is performed at high temperature with the resummation including dressed propagators and vertices ( e.g. the parton self energy computed with soft external momenta as the so called htl approximation is proportional to @xmath1 . ) in loop diagrams @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading - order calculation was accomplished in @xcite .",
    "however , due to the strong coupling of the qgp around the deconfinement temperature , perturbative approaches may become invalid for the study of electromagnetic properties of the qgp in relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "although the electric conductivity of the qgp has been recently obtained from lattice simulations @xcite , the non - perturbative computation of full spectra of photon or dilepton production in sqgp is still formidable .    the gauge / gravity duality , which connects the strongly coupled gauge theories and classical supergravity , provides an alternative way to tackle non - perturbative problems @xcite .",
    "it has been widely applied to investigate the heavy ion collisions ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in holography , the study of thermal - photon production and dilepton production from a strongly coupled @xmath0 sym plasma was initiated by @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the contributions from prompt photons and thermal photons from hadron gas are incorporated to compute both the spectra and flow of direct photons in both rhic and lhc energies . here , we summarize our findings in short :    1 .   holographic photon production results in enhanced spectra of direct - photons especially for direct photons with high transverse ( perpendicular to the beam direction in experiments ) momenta @xmath4 .",

    "the difference is smaller in the d+au collisions compared to p+pb collisions at the higher collision energy .",
    "although the hierarchy of direct photon anisotropic flow coefficients remains the same as those in nucleus - nucleus collisions , the splittings among the results using different emission rates are larger in 0 - 1% p+pb collisions at 5.02 tev .",
    "the direct photon anisotropic flow coefficients in small collision systems show a stronge sensitivity to the qgp photon emission rates .      in general , direct - photon production with holographic models",
    "is enhanced compared to the one with pqcd especially in intermediate @xmath4 , which may stem from the blue shift of thermal - photon - emission rates in strongly coupled scenarios as shown in section [ sec_photon_emission ] , which is also in accordance with fig.[fig6.1.2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , we find that the flow of direct photons with holographic models is generally suppressed in low @xmath4 . on the contrary , in high @xmath4 ,",
    "the flow from v - qcd and the sym plasma surpasses the one from pqcd . to analyze the hierarchy of the flow of direct photons by changing sources in the qgp phase , we further illustrate the flow of  thermal photons \" generated in the qgp phase , where the photons from hadronic phase are excluded , from distinct sources .",
    "we firstly focus on nucleus - nucleus collisions especially for the lhc collisional energy . as shown in fig.[fig6.7 ] , except for the one from pqcd , the hierarchy of flow for `` thermal photons '' is similar to the one for direct photons in high @xmath4 as shown in fig.[fig6.3 ] . since the photon emission at high @xmath4 from the qgp phase dominates the one from hadronic phase as illustrated in fig.[fig6.1.2 ] , the momentum anisotropy of the thermal photons from the qgp phase is the only cause of flow .",
    "the high @xmath4 regime thus allows us to unambiguously compare the effects on flow from different sources without the contamination from hadronic contributions .",
    "it turns out that pqcd , sym , and vqcd1 lead to larger flow of thermal photons from the qgp phase for both @xmath142 and @xmath143 in this region as shown in fig.[fig6.7 ] .",
    "since the flow is related to the weight of photon emission at different temperature ( equivalently the time elapse ) during the expansion of the medium , we may illustrate the ratios of the emission rates at @xmath70 to the ones at @xmath41 in high @xmath4 to have an intuitive understanding of the hierarchy of flow . as shown in fig.[r_ratio_high_pt ] , the high-@xmath4 photons are dominantly generated at high temperature in fig.[r_ratio_high_pt ] is in the rest frame of the fluid cell , which in fact differs from the @xmath4 in the lab frame , while the analysis may still capture `` qualitative '' features of the flow at high @xmath4 in the lab frame . ]",
    ". the smaller ratios of emission rates in high temperature should result in larger flow due to larger weights of photons emitted at lower temperature .",
    "the hierarchy of emission - rate ratios at high temperature in fig.[r_ratio_high_pt ] thus approximately manifests the hierarchy of thermal - photon flow at high @xmath4 in fig.[fig6.7 ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that the hierarchy of the spectral functions in high energies could be distinct from the hierarchy in low energies .",
    "nevertheless , for the direct - photon flow , one finds that the one for pqcd rate is suppressed at high @xmath4 as shown in fig.[fig6.3 ] , which contradicts the thermal - photon flow from the qgp phase .",
    "the suppression of flow for pqcd stems from the dilution by prompt photons , while the dilution for holographic models is less severe due to larger rates of holographic models at high @xmath4 . in conclusion ,",
    "the direct - photon flow at high @xmath4 is governed by the competition between the dilution by prompt photons and the ratios of emission rates of thermal photons in the qgp phase at high temperature .    on the other hand , at low @xmath4 or intermediate @xmath4 , the thermal photons from hadronic phase become more significant , which play a central role for the direct - photon flow .",
    "due to the interplay between thermal photons created in qgp and hadronic phases , it is more difficult to analyze the hierarchy of flow from distinct models",
    ". nonetheless , the enhancement of the direct - photon spectra for holographic models at low @xmath4 is minor .",
    "the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in spectra and flow at low @xmath4 are more associated with underestimation of thermal photons from hadronic radiation in our study .",
    "gev in the rest frame(rf ) . ,",
    "width=283,height=226 ]     gev in the rest frame(rf ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=226 ]    in the simulations for small collision systems , due to the suppression of thermal photons from the confined phase as shown in ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[fig6.4 ] , the flow is primarily engendered by photons from the qgp phase .",
    "in addition , one finds that the thermal - photon spectra are more dominant than the prompt - photons spectrum in the @xmath144 p+pb collisions , whereas the thermal - photon spectra become more comparable to the prompt - photons spectrum in the @xmath145 d+au collisions . the direct - photon flow in the latter case is accordingly suppressed in comparison with the former case as illustrated in ( c)-(f ) of fig.[fig6.4 ] .",
    "moreover , since the spectra from holographic models are more prominent than the one from pqcd in the former case , we find that the flow for holographic models dominates the flow for pqcd at high @xmath4",
    ".    however , in the latter case , the flow from different models are more comparable due to their approximate spectra at high @xmath4 . in intermediate @xmath4 , because of the considerable suppression of prompt photons , the flow reaches maximum in this region . at low @xmath4 , photons from hadron gas may start to affect the flow though their influence is highly suppressed compared to the case in aa collisions . on the other hand , since the spectra for different holographic models and pqcd converge , particularly in the @xmath145 d+au collisions , the splitting of flow is also reduced .",
    "future comparisons with experimental observations in small collision systems could further verify the importance of the influence from thermal photons in the qgp phase on anisotropic flow .",
    "in this work , we have evaluated the direct - photon production in heavy ion collisions from holography convoluted with the medium evolution and the inclusion of other sources .",
    "the agreement with experiments in spectra is improved compared with the previous study by using the pqcd rate . on the other hand ,",
    "the deviation in flow is increased at low @xmath4 but decreased at high @xmath4 .    in small collision systems , where the experimental data of direct photons have not been available , holographic models",
    "lead to enhancements in both spectra and flow .",
    "our findings may highlight the strong influence of thermal photons from the qgp phase on the direct - photon flow at high @xmath4 , where hadronic contributions are highly suppressed .",
    "the enhancement of flow in this region stems from the amplification of the weight of late - time emission and the amplitude of thermal - photon emission in the qgp phase .      on the contrary , our study may further _ suggest that the hadronic contributions are responsible for the flow at low @xmath4 . _",
    "in contrast to the nucleus - nucleus collisions , the dominance of qgp photons could be more pronounced in small collision systems for larger @xmath4 window .",
    "therefore , future measurements of direct - photon spectra and flow in small systems will be crucial to understand the electromagnetic property of the sqgp .",
