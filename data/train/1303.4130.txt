    "quiescent prominences / filaments are large structures made of relatively cool plasma , which exist in quiet - sun regions of the corona . prominences , observed in chromospheric lines , have a temperature of approximately @xmath7k @xcite and number density @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xcite , which gives a density of @xmath11 g @xmath10 giving a decrease and increase of approximately two orders of magnitude respectively from the surrounding corona .",
    "the pressure scale height of a prominence ( @xmath12 ) can be calculated to be @xmath13 km , which is about two orders of magnitude less than the characteristic height of observed quiescent prominences ( @xmath14@xmath15 mm ) .",
    "using a characteristic gas pressure of @xmath16dyn@xmath17 @xcite and magnetic field of @xmath8@xmath18 g @xcite the plasma @xmath5 ( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) of a quiescent prominence can be estimated as @xmath19@xmath2 . for reviews on the current understanding of solar prominences",
    "see , for example , @xcite .    globally",
    ", quiescent prominences are incredibly stable and often exist in the corona for weeks . on smaller scales , however , the prominence / filament system displays many localised instabilities and flows .",
    "observations of quiescent prominences have shown downflows @xcite , plumes @xcite , vortices of approximately @xmath20 km @xmath21 km in size @xcite and rising bubbles @xcite with velocities of 10 - 30 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the launch of the _ hinode _ satellite revealed lots of flows orientated along the direction of gravity as well as many vertical prominence threads @xcite , which implies that gravity must be an important force in the quiescent prominence system .",
    "it has long been hypothesised that the support of prominence material against gravity is by the magnetic tension of a curved magnetic field @xcite . in this way , it is possible to maintain a prominence that is significantly taller than the pressure scale height .",
    "the kippenhahn - schlter model is one such prominence model , where lorentz force , which results from the curvature of the magnetic field , gives sufficient magnetic tension to balance the gravitational force of the dense plasma .",
    "this model describes the local structure of the prominence and , as a result , has no transition to a hot corona and is infinite in extent in the vertical direction .",
    "this model has been shown to be both linearly and nonlinearly stable to ideal lagrangian magnetohyrodynamic ( mhd ) perturbations @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of recent developments in terms of the development of prominence models on larger scales .",
    "complex 2.5d equilibria that include a large - scale magnetic field and corona have been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies have managed to reproduce many observed prominence features , including the formation of double layered prominences .",
    "recent studies on coronal condensation have shown that this is a very promising mechanism to form prominences self - consistently in a magnetised corona @xcite .",
    "the most common approach for modelling observed prominences / filaments is that of directly modelling the magnetic field of prominence / filament systems using observations of the photospheric magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , straight extrapolations of the photospheric magnetic field using either potential or nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) extrapolations often fail to create the dips in the magnetic field that are necessary to support plasma .",
    "to circumnavigate this issue , the most common method is to artificially insert a flux rope into the coronal magnetic field and calculate a new equilibrium .",
    "@xcite presented models using photospheric magnetic field measurements to calculate the coronal magnetic field around observed filaments . to these magnetic field extrapolations",
    ", flux tubes were added , and the positions of the dips in the flux tubes were compared with the filament / prominence structure .",
    "the results showed that the average field strength in the quiescent prominence modelled was approximately @xmath8 g .",
    "it was also found that the positions of the dips reproduced the global structure of the prominence / filament reasonably well .    in an attempt to match the observations of the vertical thread structure of quiescent prominences with theoretical expectations , @xcite proposed a model in which the threads are supported by a tangled magnetic field .",
    "as in classic prominence models , the lorentz force from dips in the magnetic field supports the plasma against gravity .",
    "the vertical threads are hypothesized to form as a result of magnetic rayleigh  taylor instability in the tangled field .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such tangled fields indeed exist in prominences , and if so , how the tangled field is formed .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we return to a more standard scenario in which the prominence plasma is located at the dips of a large - scale magnetic flux rope @xcite .",
    "in this paper we perform 2.5d numerical simulations to investigate the prominence structure obtained by inserting mass into a flux tube in the solar corona .",
    "the aim of this work is understand how the addition of prominence material alters the structure of the coronal magnetic field and to investigate the equilibrium formed .",
    "in this section the basic assumptions of the prominence modelling are described .",
    "a quiescent prominence and its local environment are considered . for simplicity",
    "we use a cartesian reference frame @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the horizontal coordinate perpendicular to the prominence axis , @xmath25 is the coordinate along the long axis of the prominence , and @xmath26 is the height above the photosphere .",
    "the coordinates are expressed in units of the pressure scale height @xmath27 of the coronal plasma ( @xmath28 mm for a 1 mk corona ) .",
    "the @xmath24 coordinate is in the range @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the half - width of the computational domain ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the magnetic field and plasma parameters are assumed to be independent of the @xmath25 coordinate , so the models are 2.5d .",
    "the construction of the models proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , an appropriate magnetic field able to support the prominence plasma is constructed .",
    "these initial fields are assumed to be nlfffs containing dips in the magnetic field lines .",
    "then the prominence plasma is inserted into the models at the dips , and the system is evolved using a time - dependent mhd code until an equilibrium is reached .",
    "the typical height of a quiescent prominence ( @xmath15 mm ) is comparable to the pressure scale height @xmath27 of the corona plasma , so the modelling must take into account the effects of gravity , not only in the prominence but also in the surrounding corona . in the following",
    "we first describe the construction of the nlfff models , and then discuss the numerical methods used in the mhd simulations .",
    "solar prominences can be classified as `` normal '' or `` inverse '' polarity depending on the direction of magnetic field at the prominence when compared to the potential field . a normal polarity prominence model was recently developed by @xcite . in this model",
    "the prominence is formed by evaporation of plasma from the chromosphere and condensation at the top of a sheared arcade .",
    "the configuration is assumed to be symmetrical with respect to the mid - plane of the arcade .",
    "we suggest that the stability of the prominence may be strongly affected by the symmetry of the configuration .",
    "if the magnetic field and/or plasma flows were asymmetric , the prominence would be pushed to one side of the arcade , as has been found in one - dimensional asymmetric loop models ( e.g. , see figure 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "also , the prominence may be subject to a gravitational instability that distorts the magnetic field lines , causing the prominence to fall down along one side .",
    "it has not yet been demonstrated that normal polarity prominences can be stable to such perturbations .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we focus on inverse polarity prominences containing flux ropes , which are believed to be more stable to such gravity - driven instabilities .",
    "the initial configuration is assumed to be a nlfff containing a twisted magnetic flux rope .",
    "the axis of the rope lies horizontally above the polarity inversion line in the photosphere ( i.e , the line @xmath32 ) .",
    "the flux rope is held down by an overlying coronal arcade that is anchored in the photosphere on the side of the prominence .",
    "the invariance of the magnetic field @xmath33 with respect to @xmath25 implies @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the magnetic flux function .",
    "note that the contours of @xmath35 are the projections of field lines onto the @xmath24@xmath26 plane . inserting the above expression into the force - free condition , @xmath36",
    ", we find that @xmath1 is a function of @xmath37 , which we write as @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "also , @xmath35 must satisfy the following partial differential equation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the derivative in the @xmath24@xmath26 plane . using ampere s law",
    ", we see that the first term is closely related to the @xmath25-component of the electric current density , @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the speed of light . at the top and side boundaries of the computational domain we use @xmath44 .      together with the boundary conditions , equation ( [ eq : d2a ] ) represents a nonlinear boundary - value problem that must be solved by iteration .",
    "let @xmath54 be the flux function for iteration @xmath55 , then we can compute @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the field @xmath58 is written as a sum of potential and non - potential components , @xmath59 .",
    "the potential field satisfies @xmath60 and is uniquely determined from the boundary conditions at the photosphere ( see equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ) .",
    "the non - potential field satisfies @xmath61 with boundary conditions @xmath62 at all four boundaries of the computational domain .",
    "this equation can be solved using a fourier method .",
    "first , the domain size is quadrupled by mirroring @xmath63 with respect to both the upper and right boundaries , and reversing the sign of @xmath64 .",
    "the functions @xmath63 and @xmath65 are written as fourier series on this enlarged domain .",
    "then the mode amplitudes of @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are wavenumbers and @xmath70 are mode amplitudes of @xmath71 .",
    "this yields the next approximation of the flux function , @xmath58 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 is updated in each iteration such that the system has a prescribed total electric current , @xmath72 , integrated over the whole domain .",
    "we note that the topology of the magnetic field is not conserved , therefore , x - points may appear and disappear during this iteration process .",
    "since the total current @xmath73 is fixed , the iteration always converges to a solution ( generally in a few hundred iterations or less ) .",
    "the final nlfff solution depends on the assumed value of the total current .",
    "expressed in units of @xmath74 , @xmath73 equals 837.8 and 544.5 for cases 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the two models are shown in figure [ model ] .",
    "it should be noted that the 2.5d flux ropes considered in this work inherently do not consider the anchoring of the flux tube ends in the photosphere .",
    "@xcite obtained prominence models by solving the magnetostatic problem for cylindrical flux ropes under the assumption that either the temperature , density or entropy is a flux function .",
    "a similar approach could have been used here .",
    "however , we find that when the weight of the prominence plasma is large compared to the field strength an equilibrium solution may not exist .",
    "our chosen approach of inserting mass into a 2.5d model of the prominence is more flexible in dealing with such non - equilibrium cases .",
    "also , in future we intend to apply our methods to full three - dimensional prominence simulations , in which case the iterative method for finding magnetostatic equilibria can not be used .      in this study",
    ", we use the ideal mhd equations . constant gravitational acceleration is assumed , but viscosity , heat conduction and radiative cooling terms are neglected .",
    "the equations are expressed as follows :    @xmath75=\\rho \\mathbf g \\cdot \\mathbf v+s_{en}\\\\ \\mathbf e = -\\frac{1}{c } \\mathbf v \\times \\mathbf b\\\\ \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\frac{p}{\\gamma -1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath77 is the unit tensor , @xmath78 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath79 is the specific heat ratio and the other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "we assume the medium to be an ideal gas .",
    "the @xmath80 terms are source terms in the equations to give the changes in density , momentum and energy of the system due to the addition of mass .",
    "the method for mass addition is explained in section [ add ] .",
    "it should be noted that the energy equation does not consider the energy balance properly , as thermal conduction and radiative heating and cooling are neglected .",
    "these terms are important for formation of prominences by creating evaporation and condensation of plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for the purposes of understanding the response of the magnetic field to high density material , the equation we use is sufficient for our purposes .    a two - step lax ",
    "wendroff scheme based on the scheme presented in @xcite is used .",
    "we take @xmath81 .",
    "damping terms are applied to the momentum terms to allow a relaxation to a new equilibrium .",
    "the simulations are carried out on a @xmath82 grid with uniform grid spacing of @xmath83      the model applied here is an idealised solar atmosphere with hot @xmath2mk isothermal corona above a @xmath84k isothermal photosphere that extends for 10 photosphere pressure scale heights ( @xmath85 ) from the bottom of the calculation domain ( see figure [ model_hydro ] ) . using this model",
    "the equations are non - dimentionalized using the sound speed ( @xmath86cms@xmath22 ) , the pressure scale height ( @xmath87 cm ) and take the density at the base of the corona above the transition region ( @xmath88g@xmath89 .",
    "we define the characteristic timescale ( @xmath90 ) as the sound crossing time over one coronal pressure scale height giving @xmath91s .",
    "the plasma @xmath5 for both models is defined at the respective o - point . as each model has a different ratio of poloidal to axial field strength",
    ", the plasma @xmath5 is set so that the @xmath1 ( axial ) component of the field is approximately equivalent in each model . to give a quantification of the strength of the horizontal ( @xmath0 ) component of the magnetic field , for the region between the transition region and the o - point ( x - point and o - point for model 2 )",
    ", the ratio @xmath92 is @xmath93 for model 1 and @xmath94 for model 2 .",
    "the boundary conditions used are the same as those for the nlfff calculation for the top boundary and the two side boundaries , i.e. a symmetric boundary which can not be penetrated by the magnetic field .",
    "the bottom boundary used is a symmetric boundary that can be penetrated by the magnetic field to reduce numerical issues in this region .",
    "the magnetic field is changed by altering the vector potential over the bottom five grid points . to remove the lorentz force that this would create",
    ", a forcing term is added that is the equal and opposite of this force .",
    "also , this region is in a dense , high @xmath5 regime , therefore it can not significantly affect the formation of the new equilibria .",
    "mass is added with a characteristic timescale of @xmath95 , i.e. in the region where mass is being added the density of each grid point should increase by one times the coronal mass in @xmath95 . in this study",
    "we will look at density increases ( @xmath96 ) of factors @xmath97 and @xmath98 from the coronal density , therefore the input time for the mass addition is @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , after this time the source term @xmath101 in equation [ cont ] is set to @xmath102 . to define the height range over which the mass is added we use the distance between the flux tube o - point ( @xmath103 ) and the highest of either the height of the transition region or the x - point ( @xmath104 ) , where the distance between these two points is defined as @xmath105 ( the superscript @xmath106 shows the values at the @xmath106th time step ) .",
    "mass is input over the height range @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "the characteristic width associated with the mass addition is @xmath108 for most cases presented in this paper .",
    "the equation defining the source term for the mass addition for time step @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) is as follows : @xmath111   \\\\ { } & \\times \\left[1 -\\tanh\\left(\\frac{z-{h_{1}}^n+0.1 \\delta h^n}{0.07 \\delta h^n}\\right)\\right ] \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    once the new mass has been added at each new time step @xmath109 ( during the addition of mass period ) , the conservative variables are recalculated .",
    "this means that the addition of mass changes the momentum and energy of the system .",
    "the addition of mass is not performed in a way that the temperature stays constant , as we aim to create cool dense regions in the corona .      with the mhd relaxation ,",
    "conditions need to be imposed to determine when an equilibrium has been reached and when the time - marching scheme can be stopped . to determine that an equilibrium has been reached ( in fact it is a state that is approximately an equilibrium , but with small finite velocity ) a maximum condition for the kinetic energy ( ke ) is used . for any time @xmath112 such that @xmath113 , if max(ke)/se @xmath114 then the relaxation is determined to have reached equilibrium . here",
    "se denotes the initial energy at the o - point given by se@xmath115 .",
    "an upper time limit for the relaxation was also imposed as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this difference in time is used to reflect the higher speed at which information can travel through the calculation domain in the cases with lower plasma @xmath5 . if the condition max(ke)/se @xmath114 is not satisfied during this time period , it is determined that no equilibrium is reached .",
    "here the magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium that results from the addition of mass to an initially force - free magnetic field in a model solar atmosphere is described .",
    "the mass was added to the system following the method described in section [ add ] .",
    "the atmosphere was then allowed to relax to a new equilibrium and this equilibrium was investigated .",
    "six different cases were used in this investigation .",
    "these are case a ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) , case b ( @xmath121 and @xmath123 ) , case c ( @xmath124 and @xmath122 ) , case d ( @xmath124 and @xmath123 ) , case e ( @xmath125 and @xmath122 ) and case f ( @xmath125 and @xmath123 ) . in this subsection and in section [ complex ] , for all figures , the cases are marked with their appropriate letter .",
    "figure [ model1_dist ] shows the magnetic field distribution and the change in density from the initial distribution ( @xmath96 ) for the six different parameter sets .",
    "a few trends are obvious from this figure .",
    "the width of the prominence becomes larger and the height smaller for a greater density , the same trend can be seen for the plasma @xmath5 . for the overlying field lines",
    ", there is no great difference irrespective of the plasma @xmath5 or @xmath96 .",
    "however , there are noticeable changes to the magnetic field structure for the region of the magnetic field that supports the prominence material .",
    "the height of the o - point falls , with a greater fall for a larger @xmath96 and @xmath5 , as well stretching of the magnetic field below the o - point and the compression of the magnetic field near the base of the prominence .",
    "it should be noted that the density increases that are visible at the bottom of the simulation domain , though comparable to the density increase in the prominence , only represents an increase of approximately @xmath126% of the surrounding density in the photosphere .",
    "an expanded view of the prominence density distribution and the magnetic field of the prominence is shown in figure [ model1_local ] .",
    "this clearly shows the structure described previously . as with the global field ,",
    "the field lines plotted in the figure that are furthest from the o - point do not change greatly , whereas those field lines that are closer to the o - point undergo more stretching to support the prominence material .",
    "the compression of the magnetic field can be seen .",
    "case f , with the @xmath123 and @xmath125 has a structure that represents that of the expected structure of the quiescent prominence that is supported by magnetic tension .",
    "the drop in o - point with height is given in figure [ model1_op ] .",
    "the change in height from the original o - point is plotted against the plasma @xmath5 .",
    "it can be seen that the change in height is strongly related to the change in plasma @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ model1_en ] shows the evolution of the magnetic , kinetic , gravitational potential and internal energies with time for cases b , d and f. the plots in each simulation show the change in energy from the initial state , with the values shown are normalised by the initial magnetic energy ( ime ) of the respective simulation .",
    "these figures show that after the mass has been added to the flux rope , the system relaxes with a steady decrease in total kinetic energy ( tke ) until the tke / ime @xmath127 and the other energies have reached constant values . the vertical dashed line in panel ( b )",
    "shows the approximate time at which the conditions for equilibrium are satisfied , with the continued evolution shown for reference .",
    "next , the horizontal and vertical distribution of the hydrodynamic variables are given .",
    "the horizontal distributions at @xmath128 are shown in figure [ model1_hor ] .",
    "for the models where a prominence is supported by magnetic tension show a thin , high density prominence region , the horizontal pressure distribution shows that the pressure at the centre of the prominence has increased by a factor of two when compared to the background pressure .",
    "figure [ model1_ver ] gives the vertical distributions of the hydrodynamic variables at @xmath129 .",
    "the two extreme cases , which imply two different mechanisms of support , are shown in panels ( b ) and ( f ) .",
    "the density distributions shown are very different .",
    "the distribution shown in panel ( b ) decreases exponentially , implying that the material is supported by a pressure gradient ( either gas or magnetic ) .",
    "the distribution shown in panel ( f ) has a density distribution that is almost constant with height in the prominence , as well as a pressure distribution that is also almost constant with height . in this case",
    "the dense material is supported by magnetic tension .",
    "figure [ model1_masscon ] shows the mass conservation in case d ( shown in figure [ model1_dist ] ) . the thick black line in panel ( a ) shows the region in which the mass conservation is calculated .",
    "panel ( b ) gives the total mass ( normalised by the initial value ) in the black region .",
    "the mass increases over the period where mass is added , then the system relaxes to the equilibrium .",
    "the total mass loss from the region ( through numerical mass diffusion ) at the end of the calculation is approximately @xmath130% of the total mass in the black region at the time that the mass injection is halted .",
    "panel ( c ) gives the average density in the black region in terms of angle around the o - point of the flux tube at times @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "figure [ model1_force ] shows the force distributions in the @xmath26-direction at @xmath129 for the final equilibriums of the different parameter sets for model 1 .",
    "the distributions shown in panels ( c)(f ) represent the distribution that would be expected for a prominence where the material is supported by magnetic tension .",
    "that is to say the gravitational force and downward acting magnetic pressure gradient ( that is part of the initial distribution of the force - free magnetic field ) are balanced by the upward acting magnetic tension force .",
    "the gas pressure gradient is not significant , apart from at the top of the prominence as a result of the increased prominence gas pressure dropping off to match with the lower coronal gas pressure .",
    "the panels ( a ) and ( b ) show a very different distribution of the forces to the parameter sets discussed in the previous paragraph . in these parameter sets , there is no longer a downward acting magnetic pressure gradient . in panel",
    "( d ) , which appears to be a borderline case , this gradient is approximately @xmath102 , but for panels ( a ) and ( b ) the direction in which the magnetic pressure gradient is working has changed .",
    "therefore , in these two cases it can be said that the prominence material is supported by a combination of the magnetic pressure and magnetic tension forces as well as a contribution from the gas pressure .",
    "when looking at these cases in figure [ model1_local ] , it can be seen that these equilibria can be viewed as failed prominences .",
    "this implies that , as expected , for prominences formed in dips of flux tubes , magnetic tension is the force that supports the prominence material .",
    "figure [ model1_beta ] shows the vertical distribution of plasma @xmath5 at @xmath129 .",
    "the plasma @xmath5 is calculated including all the components of the magnetic field ( solid line ) and also only including the @xmath0 component ( dashed line ) .",

    "panel ( b ) shows a peak in the plasma @xmath5 , panel ( d ) shows that the plasma @xmath5 is almost constant and panel ( f ) shows a plasma @xmath5 that decreases with height , implying that the dominant axial field still exists . looking only at the @xmath0 component , which is important for the tension support , shows that it takes approximately a plasma @xmath137 in the prominence ( see panel ( c ) ) to support @xmath122 and approximately a plasma @xmath138 in the prominence ( see panel ( f ) ) to support @xmath123 .      to investigate the nature of the support of the prominence material by magnetic tension",
    ", we take the parameter set with @xmath139 and @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ model1_mag_dist ] give the vertical distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath129 and the horizontal distribution of @xmath140 at @xmath141 .",
    "the vertical distributions show that the strength of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the magnetic field have increased in strength by a factor of approximately @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively at the height @xmath128 .",
    "these increases in the field strength are a direct result of the compression of the magnetic field as a result of the increased density dragging down the magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath140 distribution shows that the maximum magnetic field strength at the height @xmath128 increases by a factor of @xmath144 and the gradient of the magnetic field is greatly increased .",
    "this combination of the larger gradient in the vertical field and the compression of the horizontal field allow the coronal magnetic field to support the prominence material .",
    "figure [ model1_mag_lines ] shows the magnetic field lines for the initial magnetic field and the final prominence equilibrium .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the curvature of the magnetic field at the base of the prominence is not significantly changed by the addition of mass , but that the magnetic field lines have accumulated .",
    "the curvature of the magnetic field , however , increases with height , which follows the decrease in the horizontal component of the magnetic field .",
    "this implies that in our model the support for the prominence material happens in the following way .",
    "* the dense material falls due to gravity , pulling the magnetic field with it , stretching the magnetic field . *",
    "the stretched magnetic field exerts a tension force on the whole of the flux tube , which then is pulled downward .",
    "* as the flux tube drops , the magnetic field in the prominence compresses especially at the base of the prominence , meaning that a reduced curvature can produce a stronger tension force * this tension force , where the curvature of the magnetic field changes significantly with height , can now support the prominence .      here",
    "we investigate the change in the prominence structure that results from the change in the width over which mass is input .",
    "the parameter set used to investigate this is @xmath125 and @xmath123 . to look at the difference in width , the mass is added with widths of @xmath108 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 used in equation ( [ massadd ] ) .",
    "figure [ model1_wid ] shows the global and local magnetic field and density distribution for , from top to bottom , widths of @xmath108 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "it can be seen that the mass input with greater width results in a lower o - point and a higher central density .",
    "this higher density comes because , even though the o - point drops , this does not significantly change the curvature of the magnetic field . as there is a component of gravity that works along the direction of the magnetic field",
    ", the prominence will contract until the pressure gradient in the prominence is great enough to balance the gravitational force .",
    "therefore , for greater widths for adding the prominence material , the final prominence density becomes higher .    to analyse the width of the prominence and how it changes with the input width , the prominence density and pressure distributions at the height @xmath147 is fitted with a gaussian distribution and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of this fitted gaussian distribution is then taken as the width of the prominence .",
    "for the three models , the fwhm of the fitted gaussian distributions are @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 for the density and @xmath148 , @xmath151 and @xmath150 for the pressure .",
    "therefore the width of the prominence can be seen to have contracted by a factor of @xmath152@xmath3 .",
    "this implies that , even with the drop in o - point height , which can reduce the curvature of the magnetic field , the accretion of mass through contraction of the prominence along the direction of the magnetic field is sufficient to pull in the prominence material .",
    "looking at the vertical force balance , see figure [ model1_wid_force ] , it is clear that the input width of @xmath153 is approaching being a failed prominence due to the larger support from pressure gradients .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that @xmath125 is sufficient to support prominences with higher mass .      here",
    "we will present the results from the mass addition for a different magnetic field model shown in figure [ model ] ( b ) .",
    "this model is called model 2 .",
    "this model differs from the model used for the previous results in three key areas :    * the o - point is initially higher by approximately @xmath154 * the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 is @xmath155 * there is an x - point below the o - point    with these differences , there is a significant change in how the system behaves .",
    "in fact , for the simulated parameters , the model does not reach an equilibrium .",
    "it should be noted here that the plasma @xmath5 values investigated here are @xmath124 , @xmath156 and @xmath126 to give a stronger @xmath0 component of the magnetic field to increase the ability of the field to support the plasma .",
    "the reason for the significant change from the previous model can be seen in figure [ model2_local ] which shows the local distribution of the magnetic field and the density change . as with the previous model , for the global field",
    "the overlying arcade remains reasonably unchanged , but it can be seen in figure [ model2_local ] that a long , vertical current sheet develops in the prominence magnetic field and with reconnection occurring at the x - point .",
    "the change in topology that this implies , means that there is dissipation of the horizontal field component that is needed to support the prominence material .",
    "therefore , while reconnection is occurring it is not possible for the prominence material to form a steady state .",
    "it can also be seen that for the @xmath124 simulations , a long thin current that forms as the magnetic field is stretched by the falling plasma .",
    "the temporal evolution of the energies for cases b ( panel ( a ) ) , d ( panel ( b ) ) and f ( panel ( c ) ) is displayed in figure [ model2_en ] . in all three cases , the maximum",
    "ke has not fallen below the set threshold and for case b it can be seen that the tke is increasing as the simulation progresses .",
    "the reason why the maximum ke does not fall below the set criteria is presented in figure [ model2_vervel ] , which shows the temporal evolution of the vertical velocity at @xmath129 for case f. peaks in the velocity can be found at the position of the x - point , highlighting this region s importance for the continued evolution of the system .    the relation between the drop in the o - point and how distended the magnetic field becomes for this model is very different from the previous model .",
    "this is because , as mentioned previously , a long , vertical current sheet develops above the prominence where only a small component of the horizontal field remains .",
    "where , in the previous case , the o - point would fall with the material , here the o - point is stretched into a line where there is no @xmath0 component of the magnetic field ( this is discussed later ) . in this respect",
    ", it can be seen that the movement of the o - point is determined by the amount of tension that is needed by the magnetic field to support the mass and the strength of the magnetic pressure at the o - point .",
    "the change in the height of the o - point is shown in figure [ model2_opoint ] .    the vertical distribution ( at @xmath157 )",
    "is shown in figure [ model2_vertical ] .",
    "this shows , apart from panel ( e ) , similar distributions of the prominence density to the failed prominences shown in section [ model1 ] . only in panel",
    "( e ) does the dense material appear to be supported to some extent by magnetic tension .",
    "this is not surprising given the significantly weaker horizontal magnetic field distribution .",
    "another point of note is the drop of density between the prominence and the region below .",
    "this is a result of the x - point , which creates a thin region with coronal density beneath the prominence , this can be seen in figure [ model2_local ] .",
    "this region may be unstable to the magnetic rayleigh  taylor instability , as observed in prominences by @xcite and studied numerically by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted again that this model does not reach an equilibrium , as can be seen in figure [ model2_force ] .",
    "the main difference between this model and the previous model shown in section [ model1 ] is that the main upward oriented force in the prominence region is gas pressure ( i.e. see panel ( b ) of figure [ model2_force ] ) .",
    "therefore , these prominences are only using the magnetic field to collimate the material and are using gas pressure to support the material .",
    "this implies that the field strength of the horizontal field is not sufficient and so lower plasma @xmath5 values are necessary for this 2.5d model , where this tendency can be seen in the figure .",
    "figure [ model2_beta ] shows the plasma @xmath5 for this model .. again both the plasma @xmath5 calculated using all the magnetic field components ( solid line ) and only the @xmath0 component are shown .",
    "though the plasma @xmath5 values are very small , looking at the @xmath0 component shows that the horizontal field is not strong enough to support the material through magnetic tension . only in the case presented in panel ( e )",
    "has the horizontal field become close to strong enough to support the added mass .",
    "figure [ model2_mag_dist ] gives the vertical distributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the magnetic field at @xmath129 and the horizontal distribution of @xmath140 at @xmath158 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 ( panel ( a ) ) shows , as mentioned previously , that the o - point is no longer a point , but a vertical line with little or no @xmath0 component of the magnetic field .",
    "as is known from the studies of the tearing instability @xcite , when this line reaches a critical length , the system is unstable to the formation of magnetic islands .",
    "the distribution of @xmath140 which results in the current sheet in this @xmath159 region is shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "this will result in reconnection which separates the prominence magnetic field into a separate flux tube embedded in the initial coronal flux tube . above the prominence region ,",
    "the @xmath1 distribution of the magnetic field does not show any significant change , but there is an accumulation of the axial field at the base of the prominence .    comparing the results from this case with the results from case 1",
    ", it is clear that there is a difference in the way the magnetic field evolves toward a magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium . for the case presented in this subsection ,",
    "the o - point is stretched resulting in the bottom of this region giving the large drop in the o - point in some cases shown in figure [ model2_opoint ] , this stretching of the o - point into a line over which there is little to no @xmath0 component of the magnetic field , especially for the parameter case b as this has a weaker magnetic field , gives a long , thin current sheet . the step like current sheet can be clearly seen for the @xmath140 distribution in this parameter set . for parameter",
    "set f , where the magnetic field is stronger , this is not so pronounced , but the weak horizontal field is still noticeable .",
    "this stretching of the o - point results from a divergence of the velocity field in the @xmath26-direction , which has its peak at the o - point .",
    "this divergence would advect the horizontal field away from the o - point , creating a long , thin region where the horizontal field is either @xmath102 or close to zero ( see figure [ model2_mag_dist ] panel ( a ) ) .    for model 1 ,",
    "two different support mechanisms were found : pressure support and tension support . for model 2 neither is found to be effective .",
    "the tension support would not be able to work because the horizontal field is insufficiently strong to support the magnetic field through magnetic tension .",
    "there is , however , a very large @xmath1 component , especially in the @xmath160 model , so it could be expected that pressure support may be possible .",
    "this mechanism does not work in this model because of the reconnection at the x - point , which means that plasma trapped inside dips and supported by magnetic pressure , can escape from the system .",
    "figure [ den_loss ] shows the change in the mass in the flux tube ( normalised so the initial mass is 1 ) .",
    "as reconnection is occurring , it should be noted that the size of the fluxtube is decreasing in time . from the peak in the mass , @xmath161% of the mass",
    "is lost over a time of @xmath162 , over the same period only a maximum of @xmath3% of the total mass loss can be attributed to cross field diffusion of mass out of the flux rope due to numerical diffusion .",
    "therefore , the reconnection allows the mass to escape the prominence .",
    "in this study , we have looked at the support of mass against gravity by the lorentz force of a coronal flux rope . it was found that the case where the support of the mass has a large contribution from pressure gradients , the structure of the formed prominence was very different from observed prominences , therefore this case can be seen as a failed prominence .",
    "however , when magnetic tension is the main force for the support of the dense material , then a prominence - like structure is formed .    the mechanism for the tension support results from two key processes .",
    "the upper region of the prominence is supported by the stretching of the magnetic field , which results in higher tension .",
    "however , at the base of the prominence , the support comes from the curvature of compressed magnetic field .",
    "as the magnetic field is compressed , it does not need a strong radius of curvature to produce the same tension as the magnetic field at the top of the prominence .",
    "the compression of the magnetic field is a direct result of the added mass , which pulls down the o - point so magnetic field accumulates at the base of the prominence .",
    "comparison between the two models showed that the drop in the o - point , and how much the magnetic field was stretched , depended heavily on the ratio of the axial field ( @xmath1 ) to the horizontal field ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it appears that when this ratio is large , the height of the o - point becomes more stable and there is greater stretching of the magnetic field , whereas when the ratio is small then there is a greater drop in the o - point height with less stretching of the magnetic field .",
    "however , due to the weak horizontal field and , in some part , to numerical reconnection in these models ( at both the x - point and in the prominence current sheet ) , it has not been possible to achieve the magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium for the second model , therefore it is difficult to give these results with greater accuracy .",
    "the reconnection found in model 2 was a result of the numerical dissipation of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the use of more grid points , or a numerical scheme that is less dissipative , would slow down the rate of the reconnection . assuming sweet  parker reconnection , where the reconnection rate is given by @xmath163 with @xmath164 as the inflow velocity , @xmath165 as the alfvn velocity and @xmath80 as the lundquist number , reduction in the numerical diffusion will slow down the rate at which magnetic field reconnects .",
    "however , only in the theoretical limit of 0 error can it be expected that numerical reconnection would not occur allowing a true equilibrium to form .",
    "looking at the plasma @xmath5 as shown in figure [ model1_beta ] , only when the plasma @xmath5 of the magnetic field supporting the dense material is less than @xmath166 is it possible to support the prominence material in the @xmath123 case .",
    "if we extrapolate to greater prominence densities , then for support of the material to be possible , it would be necessary that plasma @xmath167 . for a prominence with gas pressure of @xmath168dyn ,",
    "the required magnetic field strength would be @xmath169 g , which is consistent with the average polar crown prominence magnetic field strength of @xmath170 g @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the magnetic field strength and the drop in the height of the flux tube o - point was theoretically analysed by @xcite , given in equation ( 25 ) of that paper .",
    "however , applying this equation to the results of model 1 , it was found that the drop in o - point was grossly overestimated for @xmath121 and underestimated for @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the assumption that gravity can be studied as a small perturbation to the system , as used in the @xcite , does not apply to the prominences studied in this work .",
    "the mass support we study is 2.5d , therefore the tension term @xmath171 can not be invoked to help support the material . for model 2 , it was not possible to support the dense material due to the large ratio of axial field to horizontal field , with @xmath172 .",
    "if variations along the axis of the prominence were allowed , then this axial field could be used for the support .",
    "therefore it should be expected that in three dimensions , support of material should be possible for plasma @xmath5 that are closer to unity than the values found in this study .",
    "this would cancel out the factor of four reduction in prominence density for the prominences studied here .",
    "it would be an interesting research topic to extend these simulations to three dimensions .",
    "it would also be interesting to then extend this work to include cowling resistivity @xcite , as it has been shown to alter the prominence magnetic field over the time scale of the cowling resistivity @xcite .    in this paper a 2.5d model for a prominence",
    "is considered .",
    "therefore , the prominence flux rope is not tied to the photosphere at its ends , and will always be unstable to internal kink modes .",
    "real world prominences have finite length , and kink instabilities can be suppressed by line - tying effects . to gauge the stability of the systems considered here ,",
    "let us assume that the modelled flux ropes have a length @xmath173 mm .",
    "the stability depends on the so - called safety factor , which is defined by @xmath174 , where the integral is over a closed contour @xmath175 constant .",
    "we find that for model 1 the safety factor increases from about 0.15 at the outer edge of the flux rope to 0.28 on its axis , while for model 2 the safety factor is much larger and nearly constant , @xmath176 .",
    "kink instability is predicted to occur when @xmath177 , so model 1 is likely to be unstable , but model 2 is stable .",
    "the parameters for model 1 were chosen to make the height of the flux rope axis as large as possible and comparable to the height of observed prominences , @xmath178 mm , because the axis determines the height of the dips .",
    "we found that this observational constraint can be satisfied only for relatively high values of the total current @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to highly twisted fields that tend to be kink unstable .",
    "we do not believe that real prominences are necessarily so highly twisted .",
    "however , with the present size of the computational domain and using equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) we were unable to obtain a weakly twisted flux rope with its axis at sufficiently large height .",
    "the issue of kink instability is not so important for the present work because we are mainly interested in the magnetic support of the prominence plasma .",
    "however , in future modelling other expressions for the photospheric flux distribution @xmath51 and/or the axial field @xmath179 should be explored .",
    "@xcite presented the condition for the onset of the continuum convective instability in prominences .",
    "a sufficient condition for the stability of the system is if the brunt - vaisala frequency projected onto a flux surface : @xmath180\\left[\\frac{b_{\\theta}\\cdot \\nabla s}{\\rho b s } \\right]\\ ] ] is greater than or equal to @xmath102 ( @xmath181 ) throughout the plasma .",
    "the models investigated in this paper do not satisfy this condition , with the frequency in the dense prominence material @xmath182 but @xmath183 in the regions where the density transitions from the high prominence density to the low coronal density . as the models studied here relax to a 2.5d mhd equilibria , we know that the systems under study are likely to be stable to @xmath184 modes of this instability",
    ". however , it is still possible that the instability could grow for @xmath185 modes .",
    "as investigated in figure 8 of @xcite , with larger density or weaker magnetic field , gravitational effects modify the growth rate of the continuum convective instability .",
    "therefore , this instability could be occurring in observed prominences resulting in the flows of the prominence material that have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . it would be very interesting to investigate this instability in terms of the conditions for its onset and the nonlinear evolution of the instability in a prominence geometry as this may provide a different explanation to the other models in the literature so far based on reconnection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or condensation formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it must be noted that the free energy of the magnetic fields studied here is rather high , a few times larger than the energy of the potential magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown that coronal magnetic fields with such large free energies would erupt @xcite .",
    "here we keep the magnetic field pinned down by using a symmetric boundary at the top of the calculation domain , which allows a stable force - free field to form . in terms of the study presented here , where the formation of a prominence in magnetic dips is studied",
    ", it does not present a large problem , but may be difficult to apply these models to analyse the global stability of the system .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite developed a global nlfff model of an observed quiescent prominence and found that the model flux rope was stable but close to the limit of stability .",
    "therefore to appears to be possible to construct stable magnetic equilibria of the type studied in this paper .",
    "extending the method presented in this paper to study prominences where the magnetic field is based on observed photospheric magnetic field would be an interesting research topic .",
