    "the spectral millimeter - wave survey of orion kl carried out with the iram 30 m radio telescope presented more than 8000 unidentified lines @xcite .",
    "many of them ( nearly 4000 ) have been identified as lines arising from isotopologues and vibrationally excited states of abundant species ( @xcite , a. lpez et al . in preparation ) .",
    "these identifications significantly reduce the number of u - lines and mitigate line confusion in the spectra .",
    "nevertheless , many of those features still remain unidentified .",
    "therefore , a search for new molecular species in that cloud based on precise laboratory measurements continues to be a field of a great research activity .",
    "recently , the discovery of methyl acetate and _ gauche_-ethyl formate ( @xcite ) , the search for allyl isocyanide ( @xcite ) as well as a tentative detection of phenol ( @xcite ) have been reported .",
    "methanol and ethanol are very well known molecules in many astrophysical environments .",
    "the thiol equivalent of methanol , methyl mercaptan ( ch@xmath3sh ) , has been detected towards sgrb2 by @xcite .",
    "previous searches for it towards dark clouds and orion did not provide positive results @xcite .",
    "however , this molecule has been recently detected towards the cold first hydrostatic core b1 ( @xcite ) and was also observed towards the hot core g327.3 - 0.6 by @xcite .",
    "hence , the thiol equivalent of ethanol , ethyl mercaptan ( ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh ) , could also be present in space .",
    "initial studies of the stark modulated microwave spectra by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provided the first values of the spectroscopic constants for the _ gauche _ and _ trans _ conformers of ethyl mercaptan .",
    "these microwave laboratory data , however , can not be used to accurately predict their frequencies in the millimeter and submillimeter - wave domains .    in this letter , we report new laboratory measurements of ethyl mercaptan in the millimeter and submillimeter - wave region and its first observation in the interstellar medium .",
    "newly derived spectroscopic constants of its _ gauche _ and _ trans _ forms have allowed us to detect the @xmath2 conformer towards orion kl with the iram 30 m radio telescope .",
    "@xmath6-ethyl mercaptan has been tentatively detected in this study .",
    "in addition , the first detection of methyl mercaptan towards orion kl is also presented .",
    "a commercial sample of ethyl mercaptan was used without any further purification .",
    "rotational spectra in the 8.7    26.5  ghz region were taken at a temperature of @xmath7c and a pressure of 6  mtorr with a waveguide chirped - pulse fourier transform microwave spectrometer at new college of florida @xcite .",
    "the waveguide was cooled via a set of home - built cooling loops connected to a chiller with a recirculating fluid ( @xmath7c is the base temperature reached ) .",
    "a 250 ns chirped pulse is generated with an arbitrary waveform generator ( tektronix awg7101 ) and subsequently frequency shifted , filtered , and amplified before interacting with a static gas sample in a 10 m coil of wrd-750 waveguide .",
    "the resulting molecular free induction decay is amplified and detected in the time - domain with an oscilloscope ( tektronix tds6154c ) , after which it is fourier transformed to generate a frequency - domain spectrum . in each spectrum , 2 million free induction decays of 4  microsecond duration were averaged and fourier transformed using a kaiser - bessel window function . peaks in the frequency - domain spectrum had a full width at half maximum of @xmath8  800  khz and so the uncertainty on the line center was set to 80  khz .",
    "rotational spectra in the millimeter ( 60    300  ghz ) and submilimeter - wave ( 500    590  ghz , 625    660  ghz , and 835    880  ghz )",
    "regions were recorded at a pressure of approximately 15  mtorr by a recently constructed millimeter - wave spectrometer at the university of valladolid ( a. m. daly et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the source of radiation is an agilent e8257d synthesizer ( 250  khz     20  ghz ) connected to a set of passive or active cascade frequency multipliers ( vdi , inc . ) .",
    "room temperature measurements were carried out in a free space 360  cm long pyrex cell . up to 170  ghz , the optical path length was doubled using a rooftop mirror and a polarization grid .",
    "a silicon bolometer was used as the detection element above 800  ghz . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the signal was detected by either schottky diodes or the quasi - optical broadband detectors ( vdi , inc . ) .",
    "all the spectra were recorded in 1ghz sections using the frequency modulation technique with second harmonic lock - in detection ( modulation depth between 20  ",
    "50  khz and modulation frequency of 10.2  khz for the semiconductor detectors and 90  hz for the cryogenic detector ) .",
    "frequency accuracy is estimated to be better than 50  khz .",
    "rotational spectra of the @xmath9s isotopologue from the microwave up to the submillimeter - wave region were measured in natural abundance .",
    "ethyl mercaptan is a near prolate asymmetric top molecule which is present in two stable forms : _ gauche _ and _ trans _ configurations which are defined by the value of the torsion angle @xmath10 of the sh group measured from the symmetry plane of the _ trans _ configuration ( @xmath11 ) , see figure [ exp]-a .",
    "for the _ gauche _ conformer , two equivalent configurations at approximately @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be interchanged by tunneling motion . a schematic potential energy diagram for the sh group torsion is shown in figure [ exp]-b .",
    "the tunneling process removes the vibrational degeneracy and the vibrational ground state is split into two substates labeled as @xmath14 and @xmath15 with an energy separation @xmath16 of about 1750  mhz ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in order to facilitate the assignments of the _ gauche_- and _",
    "trans_-ethyl mercaptan millimeter - wave spectra , the microwave data from @xcite were used for initial predictions of the rotational transitions .",
    "pickett s spectral fitting programs spcat and spfit @xcite were used to predict the spectra as well as to determine the spectroscopic constants . the visualization , processing and the assignments of the rotational spectra were performed using the sview and ascp programs included in the aabs package @xcite .",
    "the rotational spectrum of _ gauche_-ethyl mercaptan is formed by two types of transitions : @xmath17- and @xmath18-type pure rotational transitions ( @xmath19  d , @xmath20  d @xcite ) between the rotational levels within the same torsion substate , i.e. @xmath21 , and @xmath22-type torsion - rotational transitions ( @xmath23  d @xcite ) connecting different torsion substates ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "figure [ exp]-d illustrates a section of the @xmath17-type @xmath25-branch pure rotational transitions which are the dominant features of the ethyl mercaptan rotational spectrum .",
    "the doubling pattern of the @xmath22-type transitions resulting from the tunneling process can be seen in the figure [ exp]-e . the frequency separation between the corresponding @xmath22-type doublets is close to @xmath26 , which is about 3.5  ghz ( see figure [ exp]-e ) .",
    "several near degeneracies of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 energy levels beginning at low @xmath27 values have been observed which require accounting for the coriolis - like terms that connect the @xmath14 and @xmath15 substates .",
    "perturbation - allowed transitions between @xmath14 and @xmath15 energy levels with @xmath28 even and @xmath29 even selection rules arising from the mixing of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 substates with the same @xmath30 quantum number have been observed as well .",
    "finally , more than 2200 distinct transitions involving the rotational quantum numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 up to 88 and 25 , respectively , have been analyzed using the effective framework fixed axes two - state hamiltonian as defined by @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the watson s @xmath36-reduced semirigid hamiltonian in @xmath37-representation @xcite for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 substates , respectively , and @xmath38 is the torsion - rotation interaction hamiltonian : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 represent the coriolis - like coupling constants .",
    "centrifugal distortion corrections up to the eighth order have been included in the analysis .",
    "all the perturbed transitions have been successfully treated by means of the coriolis - like constants defined in equation [ htr ] , with the @xmath43-dependence of @xmath40 constant taken into account .",
    "for the _ gauche_-@xmath9s isotopologue , more than 700 transitions ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 up to 56 and 18 , respectively ) have been analyzed in the same manner as the parent species .",
    "the determined spectroscopic constants for both isotopologues are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the measured frequencies are given in table [ tab_ch3ch2sh ] ( the full table [ tab_ch3ch2sh ] is given in the supplementary material ) .",
    "the rotational spectrum of _ trans_-ethyl mercaptan is dominated by pure rotational @xmath17- and @xmath18-type transitions ( @xmath44  d , @xmath45  d @xcite ) .",
    "an example of measured @xmath17-type @xmath25-branch transitions is illustrated in figure [ exp]-c .",
    "many assigned _ trans _ transitions with higher values of @xmath32 quantum numbers have been found to be affected by perturbations which may originate from interactions with low - lying first excited states of the sh and ch@xmath0 torsional modes .",
    "only the unperturbed transitions were included in the final fit .",
    "more than 600 distinct transitions with @xmath31 and @xmath32 quantum numbers up to 64 and 13 , respectively , were analyzed using the standard single - state semirigid @xmath36-reduced hamiltonian @xcite with octic centrifugal distortion constants .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic constants are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the measured transitions are given in the full table [ tab_ch3ch2sh ] ( see the supplementary material ) .",
    "five observing sessions ( from september 2004 to january 2007 ) were required for completing a molecular line survey in all the frequencies available by the a , b , c , and d receivers ( 80    115.5 , 130    178 , 197    281 ghz ) of the iram 30 m telescope towards orion kl ( irc2 source at @xmath10(j2000)=5@xmath46 35@xmath47 14.5@xmath48 , @xmath49(j2000)=@xmath505@xmath51 22@xmath52 30.0@xmath53 ) .",

    "the intensity scale was calibrated using the atm package @xcite .",
    "the observations were performed in the balanced wobbler - switching mode . as backends we connected two filter banks ( 512  mhz of bandwidth for each one and 1  mhz of spectral resolution ) and a correlator ( 2@xmath54512  mhz of bandwidth and 1.25  mhz of spectral resolution ) . pointing and focus were checked every 1    2 hours on nearby quasars .",
    "the data were processed with the gildas software .",
    "the data reduction consisted of removing lines from the image side band and fitting and removing baselines .",
    "figures are shown in units of main beam temperature , t@xmath55=t@xmath56/@xmath57 , where @xmath57 is the main beam efficiency .",
    "more detailed description of the observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "at least four cloud components could be identified in the line profiles of our low resolution spectral lines , characterized by different radial velocities and line widths @xcite .",
    "each component corresponds to a specific region of the cloud that overlaps in our telescope beam : the extended ridge or ambient cloud ( t@xmath58 @xmath5 60 k ) ; the compact ridge , a dense clump characterized by the emission of organic saturated o - rich molecules at a t@xmath58 @xmath5 150 k ; the plateau , or outflow from the new born stars ( t@xmath58 @xmath5 150",
    "k ) ; and the hot core , a dense and warm region rich in organic saturated n - bearing molecules ( t@xmath58 @xmath5 250 k ) .",
    "direct laboratory measurements and derived spectroscopic constants given in table [ tab1 ] have allowed us to detect @xmath2-ethyl mercaptan and to tentatively detect the @xmath59 conformer in the molecular line survey of orion kl by means of a large number of spectral lines free of blending with other species .",
    "table [ tab_ch3ch2sh ] provides ( together with the transitions measured in the laboratory ) the observational parameters of the detected lines that are not strongly blended with other molecules . owing to the weakness of these features ,",
    "the main beam temperature has been obtained from the peak channel of the spectra , so errors in the baselines and contribution from other species could affect this parameter .",
    "therefore , t@xmath55 has to be considered as the total intensity of the detected feature and an upper limit to the intensity of ethyl mercaptan in this study . a total amount of 34 transitions free of blending ( in the peak channel of the feature ) and 43 slightly blended lines are reported in table [ tab_ch3ch2sh ] for @xmath2ethyl mercaptan .",
    "no missing lines have been found for this conformer .",
    "figure [ fig - ethyl ] shows some of the lines of @xmath2-ethyl mercaptan reported here .",
    "even though the @xmath2 conformer being more stable , the number of potential lines to be detected for the @xmath59 conformer could be larger due to the higher value of its @xmath18-dipole moment component ( see above ) . for @xmath59-ethyl mercaptan",
    ", 72 lines free of blending and 52 slightly blended lines could be present in the survey .",
    "they are listed in table [ tab_ch3ch2sh ] with the estimate of their parameters . however ,",
    "the weakness of the transitions of @xmath59-ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh and the high overlap with other molecules make difficult the assignment of isolated lines of this conformer as they appear at the confusion limit of the line survey .",
    "hence , we consider only a tentative detection for the @xmath59 conformer of ethyl mercaptan ( see below ) .",
    "we also searched for ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh in the primos surveyaremijan / primos / index.html ] with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) in the frequency range between 300mhz and 50ghz and in the @xmath6013@xmath61 u lines of the 3 mm iram 30 m survey reported by @xcite , both surveys towards sgrb2 , finding a negative detection in both set of data .    in order to compare the emission of ethyl mercaptan with that of methyl mercaptan ,",
    "the latter species was searched for in orion kl .",
    "the laboratory frequencies and dipole moment values used for the methyl mercaptan are those predicted by @xcite and have been implemented in the madex code @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig - ethyl ] and [ fig - methyl ] show selected lines of @xmath2-ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh and a / e - ch@xmath3sh , respectively .",
    "both figures show our best model for these species ( see below ) , and the total model for the already studied species in this survey ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the figures show lines free of blending , or moderately blended with lines from other species .",
    "no missing lines have been found for methyl mercaptan in the frequency range covered by our line survey .    to model the emission of a / e - ch@xmath3sh and @xmath2/@xmath59-ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh we have considered that both molecules come from the same region of orion kl ( hot core at @xmath62=5kms@xmath63 and @xmath64@xmath65=7kms@xmath63 ) .",
    "lines from methyl mercaptan are typically 10 times stronger than those of ethyl mercaptan .",
    "we used the madex code in lte conditions due to the lack of collisional rates for these species .",
    "beam dilution and the position of the source with respect to the pointing position were taken into account in our models .",
    "we assumed a @xmath66=10  and @xmath67=3  .",
    "in @xcite we estimated the uncertainties of the column density results in this survey to be between 20  ",
    "30 % considering different sources of uncertainty such us the spatial overlap of the different cloud components , the modest angular resolution of any single - dish line survey or pointing errors .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainty due to high overlap problems has to be considered for results obtained by means of weak lines such as those of ethyl mercaptan ( raising the uncertainty up to 50 % ) .",
    "the physical and chemical parameters derived by the model are a common kinetic temperature of 200@xmath6850k for ethyl and methyl mercaptan and a column density of ( 5.0@xmath682.0)@xmath5410@xmath69@xmath70 for each a and e state of ch@xmath3sh and of ( 2.0@xmath681.0)@xmath5410@xmath69@xmath70 for @xmath2-ethyl mercaptan . for @xmath59-ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh we can report only a tentative detection with an upper limit to its column density of @xmath71(2.0@xmath681.0)@xmath5410@xmath69@xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we found that methyl mercaptan is @xmath55 times more abundant than ethyl mercaptan in the hot core of orion kl .",
    "the population of different conformers of ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh follows a boltzmann distribution so the abundance ratio between both conformers of ethyl mercaptan is given by @xmath72/@xmath73=exp(-@xmath74/@xmath75 ) , where @xmath74 is the difference of energy between the conformers ( 230k , m. l. senent , private communication ) and @xmath75 is the kinetic temperature of the medium . at 200k",
    "this formula yields a @xmath72/@xmath73 value of 0.32 whereas at 300k this number rises up to 0.46 .",
    "these abundance ratios have to be corrected by the vibrational partition function of both conformers .",
    "for t@xmath58=200k the vibrational partition function for @xmath2 is 1.47 and for @xmath59 it is 1.54 ( m. l. senent , private communication ) . applying these corrections ,",
    "our abundance ratio between @xmath59 and @xmath2 ( both states 0@xmath76 and 0@xmath77 ) is @xmath711 .    in order to compare these results with structurally similar molecules , we modeled the emission of ethanol ( @xmath59/@xmath2-ch@xmath3ch@xmath4oh ) and methanol ( a / e-@xmath78ch@xmath3oh ) in our line survey using the madex code and lte conditions ( a. lpez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . for fitting the line profiles in this large spectral range ,",
    "five cloud components are required : the four components described in sect.[sect - obs ] and a hotter ( 300k ) and smaller ( @xmath66=7  ) compact ridge . for the four former components , the assumed physical conditions are those derived in @xcite .",
    "we obtained a column densities of ( 6@xmath682)@xmath5410@xmath79@xmath70 , ( 2.2@xmath680.6)@xmath5410@xmath80@xmath70 , and ( 1.7@xmath680.4)@xmath5410@xmath80@xmath70 for each state of ch@xmath3oh ( assuming a @xmath81c/@xmath78c ratio of 45 , see @xcite ) , for the @xmath59 conformer of ethanol , and for @xmath2-ch@xmath3ch@xmath4oh , respectively .",
    "therefore , methanol is 30 times more abundant than ethanol in orion kl .",
    "this difference between @xmath82(ch@xmath3oh / ch@xmath3ch@xmath4oh ) and @xmath82(ch@xmath3sh / ch@xmath3ch@xmath4sh ) could be due to the methanol and methyl mercaptan stay time on the dust grains before evaporation .",
    "if methyl mercaptan stays on the dust grains longer time than methanol , then , further chemical processing could occur changing the abundance ratios between methyl and ethyl species .",
    "taking into account that the emission of the @xmath50oh species comes mainly from the compact ridge whereas methyl and ethyl mercaptan emit from the hot core , the differences of relative abundances between the methyl and ethyl species could be also due to the chemical differentiation between these two regions inside orion kl .",
    "most sensitive observations , with interferometers such us alma are needed to derive accurate column densities of the two conformers of ethyl mercaptan and to study their spatial distribution in orion .",
