    ", the primordial magnetic field shape and amplitude should be measured in as many ways as possible .",
    "the simplest limit arises from the cosmological expansion dynamics during big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "this requires that the energy density of the magnetic field should not be larger than about 10% of the radiation energy density .",
    "this limits the present ( inflation - generated ) magnetic field strength to less than a few @xmath1 g , if the primordial magnetic field was generated prior to or during big bang nucleosynthesis , and was not damped or amplified by a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) or some other process and so stays frozen into the plasma @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cmb temperature anisotropies that a primordial magnetic field induces ( as mentioned above ) , such a field will faraday - rotate the cmb polarization anisotropies @xcite .",
    "currently available faraday rotation data give a bound on the primordial magnetic field strength of less than a few ng ( for a scale - invariant or homogeneous primordial magnetic field ) .",
    "another interesting signature of a cosmological magnetic field is the relic gravitational wave signal generated by the anisotropic magnetic stress @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the induced gravitational waves is determined by the magnetic field energy density , so a direct measurement of the resulting gravitational wave signal can lead to an independent limit on the magnetic field strength ; see ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "after the universe reheats at the end of inflation , the plasma that was created then has large conductivity and it is conventional to assume that this remains the case as the universe evolves to the present . in this case",
    "the large - scale cosmological magnetic field behaves as a frozen - in field with an evolution determined by the simple , flux - conservation , dilution of magnetic field lines , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the physical cosmic time and @xmath10 is the cosmological scale factor . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of a primordial magnetic field is a complex process influenced by mhd as well as by the dynamics of the universe @xcite .",
    "in particular , the presence of a magnetic field can dramatically affect primordial turbulence ( e.g. , when the turbulence is associated with cosmological phase transition bubble motions ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a magnetic field itself might lead to the development of turbulent motions , and so affect the turbulence @xcite .    in a recent examination @xcite of the effects of the mhd coupling between a primordial magnetic field and turbulence during a cosmological phase transition , we considered two different initial shapes for the spectrum of the primordial magnetic field : a single - scale magnetic field and a magnetic field with a batchelor spectrum at large scales . in this paper",
    "we present a similar analysis for modified initial conditions for an inflation - generated primordial magnetic field @xcite , coupled via the usual mhd equations with the fluid , during the electroweak or qcd phase transitions .",
    "we consider both non - helical and helical magnetic field cases .",
    "we assume that the phase transition bubbles induce a typical length scale at which the magnetic field starts to interact with the phase transition fluid .",
    "the relevant difference between the electroweak and qcd phase transitions is encoded in the difference between values of parameters such as the temperature @xmath11 , the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath12 , the bubble number , and bubble sizes .",
    "we assume initial absence of primordial turbulence , i.e. , we assume that the plasma is initially at rest ( although it is possible to generate turbulent motions through bubble collisions and nucleation @xcite ) .",

    "the alfvn velocity does not depend on @xmath11 but is weakly dependent on @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath21 .    in our previous simulations @xcite we studied phase - transition - generated magnetic fields coupled to a relativistic fluid and discovered that equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy densities is reached within reasonably short times . in this paper",
    "our main purpose is to consider different initial conditions . in particular , in the case",
    "when the magnetic field is generated during inflation , we investigate the kinds of turbulent motions that result from the coupling of the magnetic field with the fluid , and determine how this affects the evolution of the field itself .",
    "we show that the presence of a magnetic field on large scales ensures a rapid rise of the velocity field on large scales . on the other hand , magnetic field decay on large scales",
    "occurs at slow rates .",

    "any field included in the lagrangian density during inflation will be produced by quantum - mechanical fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are then stretched by the cosmological expansion , leaving the hubble radius during inflation and re - entering it at much later times .    adding the standard abelian vector field lagrangian density @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the vector potential coupling constant ) to the usual general relativity and scalar inflaton field lagrangian density results in electric and magnetic fields being generated during inflation .",
    "of course , these are not the usual low - energy electric and magnetic fields ; rather , at the very least , they are hypercharge electric and magnetic fields . during inflation",
    "the conductivity vanishes , but particle creation at reheating quickly turns the universe into a very good conductor at the end of inflation .",
    "this short circuits the electric field but does not affect the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "for a close to de sitter exponentially expanding epoch of inflation , on a scale of a thousandth of a hubble radius now ( i.e. , a few mpc now ) , the r.m.s .  magnetic field strength now is of order @xmath24 g and very insignificant @xcite . in this case",
    "the power spectrum of the magnetic field is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the coordinate wave number , and the evolution with scale factor @xmath27 is as expected from flux conservation .",
    "this tiny value is a consequence of the conformal invariance of the abelian vector field lagrangian density and the background spacetime . to generate a large enough magnetic field requires using a model in which conformal invariance is broken @xcite .",
    "a simple way to break conformal invariance is to couple the inflaton scalar field @xmath5 to the abelian vector field through a dilaton - like coupling , generalizing the maxwell lagrangian density to @xmath28 ( @xmath7 is a parameter and the exponential form of the dilation - like coupling was chosen for simplicity ) @xcite . at the end of inflation , during reheating , @xmath5 freezes at its vacuum expectation value and the usual abelian vector field lagrangian density is recovered . during inflation however , the model behaves as though it has a varying abelian vector field coupling constant .",
    "this modifies the scale factor and wave number dependence of the generated magnetic field . for power - law inflation @xcite , power",
    "is shifted to the infrared and the magnetic field energy density redshifts slower than the usual uncoupled abelian vector field case .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath7 , this can result in a large enough seed magnetic field to explain the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
    "the case of greatest interest is near the limit of de sitter exponential expansion inflation , which results in a close to scale - invariant harrison - peebles - yu - zeldovich spectrum of energy density perturbations ( consistent with the observational indications , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) with a current epoch magnetic field scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath29 , or @xmath30 , and r.m.s .",
    "amplitude of order a few ng on a scale of a thousandth of a hubble radius @xcite .",
    "these computations have been carefully checked , confirmed , and extended @xcite .",
    "this is an observationally viable model .    in this model , there are regions in model parameter space where the vector field fluctuations during inflation are large enough to invalidate the linear perturbation assumption , but this does not occur in the region of parameter space where a strong - enough current - epoch large - scale magnetic field is generated @xcite .",
    "that is , backreaction is not a significant issue for this classically consistent model . while the abelian vector field coupling becomes large during inflation , this is not important for the phenomenological , effective classical model @xcite . instead , much like the case of the `` standard '' @xmath31cdm cosmological model , it is of great interest to try to find a more fundamental , quantum - mechanically consistent , model that can give rise to this classical , observationally - successful , inflationary magnetogenesis model .",
    "an extension of this model , with two scalar fields instead of one , is also viable @xcite . here , in addition to the usual scalar inflaton field , a new scalar field , coupled as a dilaton to the abelian vector field ,",
    "is introduced . alternatively ,",
    "as discussed next , the second field is taken to be a pseudoscalar , coupling like an axion to the abelian vector field .",
    "for other inflationary magnetogenesis variants see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inverse cascade scenario , a much discussed magnetic field amplification mechanism , requires non - zero magnetic helicity , if it is to be able to transfer magnetic power from small scales to large scales and so amplify the large - scale magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider inflationary magnetogenesis models that can also generate magnetic helicity .    in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker cosmological model ,",
    "magnetic helicity is @xcite @xmath32 where the vector potential @xmath33 is related to the magnetic field through @xmath34 .",
    "magnetic helicity is usually associated with a nontrivial configuration of the magnetic field where the magnetic flux tubes are twisted and/or linked @xcite .",
    "magnetic helicity resembles a chern - simons term , for its time variation is given by @xmath35  @xcite , where @xmath36 is the vector field strength tensor dual .",
    "this similarity is strengthened by the fact that a helical magnetic field may be identified as the projection of a non - abelian gauge field configuration carrying a nonvanishing chern - simons number @xcite , and that the magnetic helicity coincides with this winding number .",
    "moreover , helical magnetic fields possess a number asymmetry between left - handed and right - handed abelian vector field helicity states @xcite .",
    "to see this it is useful to go to fourier space and introduce the orthonormal helicity basis @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 form a right - handed orthonormal basis .",
    "decomposing the magnetic field in polarization states as @xmath41 , the magnetic helicity reads @xmath42 and @xmath43 transformations , a cosmological helical magnetic field would be a signature of macroscopic @xmath44 and @xmath43 violation .",
    "models for generating helical magnetic fields in the early universe exist in the literature  @xcite . in order to generate a helical magnetic field during inflation",
    ", one can add an interaction term of the form @xmath45 to the abelian vector potential lagrangian density . here",
    "@xmath46 is a pseudoscalar function of some dynamical or background field @xmath5 .",
    "a coupling @xmath47 , between the abelian vector potential and the axion field @xmath5 was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the pseudoscalar @xmath5 was assumed to drive inflation . in these cases , because of the extra derivative compared to the @xmath28 term , magnetic power is concentrated on smaller scales , with insignificant magnetic power on cosmological scales of interest .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , to produce larger - scale magnetic field power , the function @xmath48 was taken to be a time - dependent function peaked at long wavelengths ( this particular coupling to the abelian vector potential could be realized by a tachyonic massive pseudoscalar field or a massless pseudoscalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity ) .",
    "it was shown that , depending on the strength of the coupling , a maximally helical field with a scale - invariant spectrum , @xmath49 , could be produced as an excitation of the vacuum during inflation .",
    "although it can be quite large , large enough to act as a seed for the magnetic fields we observe today in galaxies and galaxy clusters , as before , its backreaction on the development of inflation is completely negligible .",
    "because of conformal invariance , the usual flat spacetime relativistic mhd equations are identical to the mhd equations in an expanding universe with zero spatial curvature when physical quantities are replaced by their co - moving counterparts and conformal time @xmath50 is used in place of physical time @xcite . based on this fact ,",
    "we perform direct numerical simulations of mhd turbulence in an expanding universe using the usual flat spacetime mhd equations with a relativistic equation of state .",
    "note that our simulations are based on the relativistic equations even when studying evolution of turbulence with non - relativistic bulk velocities .",
    "let us briefly describe the primordial magnetic field coupling to the fluid . as noted above , the typical characteristic length scale of this coupling is the phase transition bubble size , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a parameter connected with the number of bubbles , @xmath53 , within a hubble radius , i.e. , @xmath54 , and the hubble radius @xmath55    as we noted above we will consider both electroweak and qcd phase transitions .",
    "the phase transitions are characterized by different maximal correlation lengths due to the difference in the @xmath56 parameter ( that is equal to 0.01 and 0.15 for electroweak and qcd phase transitions , respectively ) and in the hubble radius ; see eq .",
    "( [ lambda - max ] ) ( that is equal to 0.006@xmath1pc and 5.5pc for electroweak and qcd phase transitions , respectively ) . as we noted above , the initial value of the alfvn velocity depends weakly on @xmath12 ( @xmath21 ) , which also makes a difference between the electroweak and qcd phase transitions of the order of unity ( 1.37 ) , which we discard .",
    "the conductivity of the universe is high enough during the phase transitions : of course the physical characteristics of the plasma ( such as viscosity and conductivity ) depend on temperature and vary from 100gev ( electroweak phase transition ) to 0.15ev ( qcd phase transition ) .",
    "on the other hand , in our simulations we assume that , for the goal of our study , the main difference between the electroweak and qcd phase transitions consists only in a difference of the initial correlation length .",
    "our assumption can be justified as follows : ( i ) the forcing amplitude at the initial moment weakly depends on the relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath57 ; ( ii ) the physical conditions of the universe are different , but new simulations for a wide range of the prandtl numbers show that the growth of the correlation length does not depend on the value of the reynolds number , as long as it is large enough @xcite .",
    "we consider two types of forcings , irrotational and vortical , and for both we assume that the forcing scale coincides with the bubble size , @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding wave number is @xmath59 .",
    "energy is being dissipated both viscously ( characterized by the viscosity @xmath60 ) and ohmically ( characterized by the magnetic diffusivity @xmath61 , which is inversely proportional to the conductivity ) . throughout this work",
    "we assume that the magnetic prandtl number is @xmath62 .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath60 , the more extended the turbulent cascade , and the larger the minimal mesh resolution required . for all runs presented here we use @xmath63 mesh points .",

    "there are many mhd simulations that use vortical forcing @xcite but fewer that use irrotational forcing @xcite .",
    "however , we are unaware of any simulation with an initial scale - invariant magnetic field spectrum , @xmath49 , of appreciable strength .",
    "we generate the corresponding magnetic vector potential for such a field in fourier space using modes with random phases and suitable amplitudes , as was done in ref .",

    "<S> we study the evolution of an inflation - generated magnetic field , due to its coupling to fluid motions , during cosmological phase transitions . we find that the magnetic field stays almost unchanged on large scales , while on small scales the spectrum is modified in such a way that power at small scales becomes progressively suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the magnetic field generates turbulent motions in the initially turbulence - free plasma . on large scales , </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the resulting kinetic energy spectrum is consistent with that of white noise . </S>"
