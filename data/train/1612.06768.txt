    "the speed at which a species expands its range is fundamental in conservation management .",
    "a knowledge of this speed enables us to predict the ability of a species to keep up with the rate at which the climate changes or the rate at which an exotic species invades , two prominent ecological challenges @xcite .",
    "it is known that traits such as dispersal and population growth affect the rate at which species expands its range , and there has been some investigation that suggests polymorphism in traits can cause a species invasion to occur at a faster rate than a single morph would in isolation @xcite . understanding the effect that each of a species traits has , and can potentially have , on its rate of spread is therefore important to understanding how the spread of a species can evolve .",
    "most common models of population dynamics incorporate aspects of dispersal and growth , _",
    "@xcite , however the mutation of one phenotype to another is a less common inclusion .",
    "even the addition of a simple mutation term can dramatically affect the behaviour of a model .",
    "cosner @xcite singles out two models in particular : the model of elliott and cornell @xcite in which a simple linear mutation is used , and the model of bouin et al @xcite in which mutations are considered to act as a diffusion process in the phenotype space .",
    "cosner notes that during their work elliott and cornell assume without proof that the spread rate of the two phenotypes in their system is determined by the linearisation of their system at the extinction state zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , that it is linearly determinate .",
    "we aim to prove this assumption .",
    "having shown this result and also established that the spreading speed is equal to the minimal speed of a class of travelling waves , we then prove further results regarding the behaviour of minimal speed travelling waves as a function of mutation , and the composition of the leading edge of minimal speed travelling waves .",
    "elliott and cornell s model examines the interaction between an establisher phenotype with population density @xmath0 , and a disperser phenotype with population density @xmath1 , using a lotka - volterra competition system @xmath2 the first term on the right hand side of each equation represents the dispersal of the phenotype through diffusion , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the dispersal rates of each morph .",
    "the second term describes the growth rate of the phenotype using a logistic term , this is similar to what is used in fisher s model @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath5 and @xmath6 to represent the growth rate of each morph , @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the intra - morph competition , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the inter - morph competition .",
    "the third and fourth terms represent a linear mutation between the phenotypes at mutation rates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is assumed that all parameters of the system are positive real numbers .    here , as in @xcite",
    ", we suppose that the establisher phenotype has the larger growth rate , while the disperser phenotype has the larger dispersal rate , @xmath13 while is not required in the proof of linear determinacy , we will make use of them in section 4 where we give some further results on the system .",
    "it is also supposed throughout that the intra - morph competition is greater than the inter - morph competition , @xmath14 and we will also make further assumptions on the smallness of @xmath10 and @xmath9 when necessary . note that roques et al @xcite prove for a competition - diffusion model without mutation in which one species invade the territory of another , that linear determinacy only holds for sufficiently small inter - species competition .",
    "we also have in mind throughout that the mutation is relatively small in comparison to the other parameters , and will again make more precise assumptions when necessary .",
    "kolmogorov , petrovskii and piskunov @xcite studied the existence of monotonic travelling wave solutions of the scalar equation @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the speed of the front .",
    "they studied the case @xmath18 , @xmath19 and proved there is a continuum of values of @xmath17 for which a monotonic travelling wave solution exists , specifically if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the minimal travelling wave speed .",
    "aronson and weinberger @xcite further studied this system and characterised @xmath21 as a a spreading speed .",
    "these results were extended to cooperative systems of equations for a suitable class of nonlinearities @xmath22 by volpert , volpert and volpert @xcite .",
    "note here that an interesting recent paper of griette and raoul @xcite studies the existence and properties of travelling waves for a special case of system in which , in particular , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , including an explicit expression for the minimal travelling wave speed given by the linearisation about the extinction state .",
    "the system studied in @xcite is certainly of the form and so we let @xmath25 , @xmath26 be a diagonal matrix containing the dispersal rates , @xmath27 and @xmath22 a nonlinear function containing the growth , competition and mutation terms , @xmath28 throughout this work we will use the notation @xmath29 to denote that the @xmath30th component of each vector satisfies @xmath31 , for each @xmath30 , similarly for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "let @xmath37 be the set of all continuous functions from @xmath38 to @xmath38 .",
    "in @xcite , elliott and cornell investigated numerically the effect of varying the parameters on the spreading speed of the system and interestingly found that , for certain values of growth and dispersal rate , the system would spread faster in the presence of both phenotypes than just one phenotype would spread in the absence of mutation .",
    "this faster speed is obtained in the region of the positive quadrant of @xmath39-space which satisfies the inequalities @xmath40 represented by the shaded area in figure [ parameters ] .",
    "elliott and cornell predict the spreading speed obtained for each set of parameters using the front propagation method of van saarloos @xcite , making the assumption that the spreading speed of system is linearly determinate in order to do so .",
    "the spreading speed of the system is said to be linearly determinate if it is the same as the spreading speed of the system obtained when is linearised about the @xmath41 equilibrium , namely @xmath42 this assumption is one that is suggested by the numerical studies in @xcite , but is not always true even in the scalar case @xcite .",
    "stokes @xcite calls the minimal wave speed @xmath21 `` pulled '' if it is equal to the linearised spreading speed and `` pushed '' if it is greater than the linearised spreading speed .",
    "typically there are qualitative differences in wave behaviour depending on whether the wave is pushed or pulled , e.g. stability in the scalar case is discussed in @xcite .    in the case of systems ,",
    "most sufficient conditions for linear determinacy require a cooperative assumption on the system .",
    "this is mainly due to the existence of a comparison principle for such systems @xcite .",
    "a system is cooperative when the off - diagonal elements of the jacobian matrix of @xmath22 are always non - negative , _",

    "the difffusion matrix @xmath26 is not a multiple of the identitiy , finding an explicit expression is not very tractable .",
    "however , by adapting an argument from @xcite , we give a result on how @xmath271 behaves as the mutation parameter @xmath159 varies .",
    "we will make use of the following lemma .",

    "we see in figure [ rerddedd ] ( i ) that as @xmath5 increases ( or @xmath6 decreases ) there is an increase in the establisher morph in the leading edge",
    ". however , as @xmath356 does not fall below @xmath357 there is always a larger amount of the disperser morph in the leading edge .",
    "as we increase @xmath5 to infinity ( or decrease @xmath6 to 0 ) @xmath356 tends to @xmath358 .",
    "the ratio @xmath356 blows up when our assumption that @xmath359 and @xmath360 no longer holds .",
    "figure [ rerddedd ] ( ii ) tells us that as we increase @xmath4 ( or decrease @xmath3 ) there is an increase in the disperser morph in the leading edge .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are close enough in value then it is possible that the establisher morph outnumbers the disperser in the leading edge , which we see in the region in which @xmath356 drops below one .",
    "as we increase @xmath4 to infinity ( or decrease @xmath3 to 0 ) @xmath356 tends to @xmath361 .",
    "the ratio @xmath356 becomes zero when our assumption that @xmath359 and @xmath360 no longer holds .    in figure [ rerddedd ] ( iii )",
    "we see that if the mutation rate of a morph is increased it results in a decrease in the density of that morph in the leading edge .",
    "since the ratio @xmath339 is not restricted to a particular range , like @xmath341 and @xmath343 due to , we see that the mutation rate is also able to change which morph is more prevalent in the leading edge . if we fix all parameters but the mutation rates in we obtain @xmath362 , where @xmath363 is a constant .",
    "thus @xmath356 goes to zero as @xmath339 grows smaller and blows up as @xmath339 tends to infinity .",
    "recall that we made assumptions on the existence of @xmath364 , @xmath321 and @xmath322 .",
    "we finish by providing some justification for these assumptions by solving equations , and as a system of 3 equations in @xmath349 , @xmath271 and @xmath365 . differentiating the latter two by @xmath159 we plot @xmath366 , @xmath348 and @xmath349 as functions of @xmath159 in figure [ mugraphcon ] demonstrating the existence of @xmath321 , @xmath322 and @xmath356 for this set of parameters .",
    "note that as @xmath159 increases we see an increase in the proportion of the phenotype @xmath1 , which is unsurprising as for this set of parameters @xmath367 . finally , we also plot @xmath365 and @xmath271 as functions of @xmath159 in figure [ mugraph ] .",
    "as @xmath280 we see @xmath365 and @xmath271 converge to the values @xmath273 and @xmath272 , respectively .",
    "further , as we increase @xmath159 we observe a decrease in the minimal spreading speed @xmath292 , this is consistent with our result in section 4.1 .",
    "in this work we considered a lotka - volterra competition system with the addition of a linear mutation , and prove that this system is linearly determinate under some assumptions on the smallness of the inter - morph competition and mutation parameters .",
    "we then use our result on linear determinacy in order to prove some further results on the system , specifically that the minimal travelling wave speed @xmath271 is a non - increasing function of the mutation rate @xmath159 , and the dependence of the distribution of morphs in the leading edge on each trait in the @xmath368 limit . note that in the absence of mutation , tang and fife @xcite established the existence of travelling fronts for for all speeds greater than or equal to @xmath369 .",
    "thus , interestingly , in the case when @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 satisfy and holds , the limit as @xmath280 of the minimal front speed @xmath292 is strictly larger than the minimal front speed for in the absence of mutation .",
    "it is worth commenting on similarities between this work and that of griette and raoul @xcite .",
    "they consider a system similar to , in which both morphs disperse at the same rate , @xmath23 , and mutate at the same rate @xmath24 .",
    "griette and raoul prove the existence of travelling waves for that system and study the shape of the waves . the fact that @xmath23 causes the matrix of diffusion coefficients to be a multiple of the identity , and allows them to find an explicit value for the minimal speed of travelling wave solutions , which is given by the linear speed .",
    "we , on the other hand , are motivated by systems in which @xmath370 and @xmath371 , treat spreading speeds as well as travelling waves using an approach different from that of @xcite to show linear determinacy , benefiting from @xcite , and then study the existence of the linearised problem by exploiting ideas from perron - frobenius theory . also we mention here the interesting recent preprint of girardin @xcite , of which we became aware just as this manuscript was being submitted , that uses different methods to establish a series of general results on spreading speeds and travelling waves that apply to systems of @xmath372 species related to system .",
    "again , our perspective is different , concentrating on system , rigorously proving claims of elliot and cornell @xcite , and in particular , studying in detail the ecologically important questions of how the speed and leading edge of the travelling front solutions of the linearised problem depend on parameters .",
    "a natural progression of our work would be a detailed analysis of systems for @xmath372 species , in particular , dependence of spreading speeds and the composition of the morphs in the leading edge on parameters .",
    "characterising the spreading speed as a non - increasing function of the mutation @xmath159 as we did in section 4.1 should extend without much difficulty as we used a matrix argument which did not depend explicitly on the number of species .",
    "it would also be of interest to see if linear determinacy could be proven for models which incorporate mutation in a different manner , such as the model of bouin et al @xcite , or a model in which the mutation coefficients themselves are a function of the population density .",
