    "hydrogen bonds ( or h - bond ) are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , and biology . the nature of h - bonds was studied in great detail by pauling who predicted the mixed chemistry of h - bonds @xcite , namely , h - bond shares characteristics of ionic and covalent bonds . on the one hand",
    ", a water molecule has a large dipole moment due to the electronegative character of the o atom and therefore water molecules are attracted to each other .",
    "this is the classical aspect of the h - bonding . on the other hand ,",
    "the sigma bonding between h and o is strongly covalent with clear quantum mechanical nature . in the process of formation of an ice crystal electrons from the sigma bond",
    "can be shared by two water molecules leading to a strong link between them .",
    "compton scattering experiments have confirmed the quantum nature of h - bonds in ice crystals @xcite .",
    "it has been clear since the early experiments in h - bond systems that although the physics of electrons in ice is important @xcite the protons are actually responsible for the amazing electrical properties of ice @xcite .",
    "the current understanding of the motion of protons in h - bond materials is mainly based in a few phenomenological models . in this paper",
    "we discuss a qualitative microscopic model which captures the basic quantum mechanical correlations of the proton system .",
    "we show that the physics of protons in ice is a clear example of a strongly correlated problem very similar to the ones discussed in strongly correlated electron systems @xcite reminiscent of the physics of mott insulators @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the motion of protons in ice is hindered by strong constraints that forbid single proton hopping and only allows for collective ring - exchange - like motion .",
    "this sort of systems are known to be closely related to the physics of gauge theories . as we will see below , in the phase of ice in which the protons are ordered , in analogy with the problem of confinement of quarks in hadronic matter",
    ", pairs of defects ( anions and cations ) cost an energy which is linear with the separation between them .",
    "although there is a vast literature on physics of ice @xcite , we focus only on the quantum motion of protons .",
    "the concepts introduced here can be easily extended to the study of many different problems in h - bond materials .",
    "ice shows many different solid phases depending on temperature and pressure .",
    "these phases are essentially controlled by the geometry of the h - bonds that link different water molecules .",
    "furthermore , a h atom is located asymmetrically relative to the two o atoms , forming a double well structure in the bond .",
    "thus , a h atom can sit in any of the two sides a bond .",
    "hence , we can think of ice as made out of protons , h@xmath5 , moving in a crystal lattice made out of o@xmath6 ions .",
    "therefore , solids made out of h - bonds are expected to have strong electrical properties .",
    "for example , ice exhibits a high static permittivity comparable with the one of liquid water , electrical mobility that is large when compared to most ionic conductors ( in fact , the mobility is comparable to the electronic conduction in metals ) .",
    "these are striking properties since in the solid phase only protons can move in an ice lattice as the electrons form a band insulator @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of ice is its extensive classical entropy at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this large entropy implies a macroscopic number of classically degenerate states at low temperatures .",
    "this is a situation very similar to frustrated magnetic systems , which the best representative is precisely called spin ice model @xcite .",
    "our study , however , focus entirely on the proton motion in ice and not on magnetism .",
    "as we show , the proton motion in ice can be mapped into a problem with pseudo - spins , in close analogy to some frustrated magnets .",
    "the most successful explanation for the physical behavior of ice was given by the phenomenological work of bernal and fowler @xcite in 1933 that gave rise to the so - called bernal - fowler ( bf ) rules : ( _ i _ ) the orientation of h@xmath7o molecules is such that only one h atom lies between each pair of o atoms ; ( _ ii _ ) each o atom has two h atoms closer to it forming a water molecule .",
    "rule ( _ i _ ) prevents situations in which a h - bond has two h atoms .",
    "rule ( _ ii _ ) does not allow for configurations in which each o has more than two h close to it . as it was shown by pauling @xcite , using a classical counting argument , these rules can account for most of the entropy measured in the experiments , and predict an extensive entropy even at @xmath8 .",
    "a more detailed calculation taking into account ring exchange of protons in ice crystal brings this number even closer to the measured value @xcite .",
    "pauling s statistical model has been very successful in explaining the distribution of protons in ice and has been confirmed experimentally in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "although pauling s calculation explains the arrangement of protons in ice it fails to describe its electrical properties .",
    "the reason for this failure is due to the fact that any motion of the protons under the bf rules requires an extremely correlated behavior @xcite . in order to explain the electrical behavior another phenomenological concept was introduced , namely , the concept of _ defects_. defects , by definition , are local violations of the bf rules . the defects associated with violation of rule ( _ i _ )",
    "are called bjerrum defects @xcite and the ones associated with violations of rule ( _ ii _ ) are called ionization defects @xcite . with the concept of defects",
    "one is able to explain most of the electrical properties of ice @xcite .",
    "protons can move by the rigid rotation of the water molecule , by thermal activation over an energy barrier from one side of the h - bond to another , or by _ quantum tunneling _ under the energy barrier between the two sides of the bond . at low temperatures , the rigid motion of the molecule and thermal activation",
    "are exponentially suppressed and only quantum tunneling is allowed .",
    "quantum tunneling is possible because the wavefunction of the proton is extended from one side to another in the bond .",
    "although the phenomenological theories of ice can account for a great part of the experimental data there are still many experiments that remain unexplained such as anomalies in the specific heat in pure @xcite and doped ice @xcite .",
    "originally it was proposed by onsager @xcite that these anomalies could be explained by a ferroelectric transition .",
    "it turns out , however , that there is no evidence for any polar effect in ice .",
    "quite to the contrary , the bf rules state that ice is a rather non - polar material . in this paper",
    "we show that by a quantum mechanical mechanism of order - by - disorder , an ordered phase of protons emerges at low temperatures .",
    "the melting of this ordered state can account for the specific heat anomalies .",
    "the classical ice model is defined on a pyrochlore lattice and its planar representation is the checkerboard lattice .",
    "the planar model is equivalent to the six vertex model what has been solved exactly by lieb @xcite .",
    "it is known from these studies that the phase diagram of the classical planar system has two phases , an ordered anti - ferroelectric phase and a line of critical points with extensive entropy at zero temperature .",
    "the anti - ferroelectric phase corresponds to a staggered arrangement of proton positions in the h - bonds .",
    "its quantum version has been studied by moessner , sondhi @xcite and collaborators @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the quantum version of the ice problem and show that quantum fluctuations stabilize the anti - ferroelectric phase in the absence of defects by a mechanism of order - by - disorder . to this end",
    ", we use a gauge theory description of the planar quantum ice problem which can be easily extended to higher dimensional systems .",
    "this gauge theory has also being used in similar models such as the quantum dimer models on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss the characteristic energy scales of the ice problem and propose the minimal model for proton motion in ice .",
    "here we discuss in detail the analogy and connection to frustrated quantum magnets .",
    "section [ mapping ] contains the mapping of the planar ice model to a gauge theory . in section [ groundstate ]",
    "we determine the ground state of the problem in the neutral sector . here",
    "we show how an ordered state of protons arises from the order - by - disorder mechanism and how the ionic defects are confined in the planar model . in section [ threedimensions ]",
    "we discuss the gauge problem in three dimensions and obtain the phase diagram including thermal effects .",
    "we show that the three dimensional case has a confining - deconfining transition even at t=0 . in section [ cphonons ]",
    "we briefly discuss the effects of lattice vibrations on the proton motion .",
    "we argue that the second order phase transitions obtained in the case without phonons can become first order .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains our conclusions and the comparison between the theory and the experimental measurements in hexagonal ( ih ) ice .",
    "consider a lattice with protons living in the bonds and where each vertex is to be interpreted as an o atom as shown in fig.[square_ice ] .",
    "the lattices we are going o discuss in this papers are the planar square lattice , the cubic lattice and the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the protons can occupy two positions in their respective link .",
    "let us divide any of those lattices into sub - lattices 1 and 2 , and for each link @xmath9 define the sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 neighboring a vertex of sub - lattice 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we can define the proton occupation number @xmath12 , @xmath13 for each proton site @xmath14 of the system .",
    "the main energy scales in this problem come from the coulomb repulsion between the protons : the on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath15 ( the so - called hubbard term ) , the coulomb repulsion between protons in the same h - bond , @xmath16 , and the coulomb repulsion between protons around the same o vertex , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the physical situation of interest for ice corresponds to the case where @xmath18 .",
    "notice that this condition ensures that there is only one proton per lattice site , only one proton per bond , and for @xmath0 filled ice it implies that there are only two protons around the o vertex .",
    "thus , the electrostatic repulsion between the protons leads to the ice rules .",
    "since we have considered interactions up to second nearest neighbors one might wonder whether we should not include interactions with even longer range .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that the water molecules interact through long - range dipole forces that in our picture would be represented by long - range interactions between h@xmath5 ions .",
    "the same problem arises in the context of spin - ice @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite for the frustrated lattices discussed here have shown that the long - range dipolar interactions `` average out '' to zero at large distances .",
    "this result shows that the ice rules are still obeyed in the absence of long - range interactions and that the degeneracy of the classical state is not lifted . moreover , improved monte carlo simulations with `` non - local '' updates detected the appearance of long range order only at very low energies , much smaller than the energy scales discussed here @xcite .",
    "thus , from now on the effects of long - range interactions between second nearest neighbors will be disregarded .",
    "the bjerrum and ionic defects mentioned earlier only occur if the protons hop from site to site .",
    "there are essentially only two types of hopping in this lattice : hopping on the h - bond with energy @xmath19 and hopping across the o vertex , @xmath20 . because the hopping energy is an exponential function of the distance it is easy to show that @xmath21 .",
    "the presence of @xmath19 allows for the hopping of the protons around the o vertices leading to the creation of ionic defects .",
    "the hopping @xmath20 , on the other hand , allows for two protons in the same h - bond and therefore can lead to bjerrum defects .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are much smaller than in electronic systems because of the much larger proton mass .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath22 making the proton motion analogous to the motion of electrons in mott insulators .        in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 so that only ionic defects are possible in the problem .",
    "it is also clear that in this limit the classical ground state obeys the ice rules and that magnetic phenomena associated with the proton spin does not play any role . within the assumption that the on - site coulomb repulsion between protons is very large ,",
    "we restrain to the case where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the proton spin degrees of freedom can be ignored .",
    "the hamiltonian for the proton motion on neutral planar ice with just one proton per bond , that is , @xmath27 is written as , @xmath28 we now make use of the constraint eq . , and define pseudo - spin operators associated to link @xmath9 as ( we use units such that @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 which , due to condition eq .",

    "the hamiltonian of eq . is written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the limit of @xmath35 the ground state",
    "is highly degenerate because there are many configurations of the pseudospins that give the same energy .",
    "one possible configuration is shown in fig.[isingconf ] .        by a duality transformation ,",
    "in which each link corresponds to a vertex of the square dual lattice , it is easy to show that eq .",
    "describes also the ising model in a transverse field on a lattice where now the spins are defined on vertices . in the case of the planar ice system , this lattice correspond to the checkerboard lattice ( see fig.[checkerboard ] ) , while for the pyrochlore and cubic lattices one obtains corner sharing tetrahedra and hexades , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the ground state of the hamiltonian of eq . with @xmath36",
    "is an eigenstate of the operator @xmath37 .",
    "this state corresponds the proton localized everywhere in either side of the link . in order to minimize the energy",
    "the distribution of protons is such that the only contributing configurations have the total magnetization of each vertex is equal to zero . for the pyrochlore and planar lattices ,",
    "this means that each o has two protons close to it and two away . for the cubic lattice one would have three protons close to the o and three away .",
    "the number of configurations that satisfy the ice rules grows exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "taking the planar case as an example , there are @xmath38 of them  @xcite .    .",
    ", width=226 ]    in the checkerboard language ( see fig.[checkerboard ] ) a sublattice of plaquettes contains next nearest neighbor interactions ( `` crossed plaquettes '' ) . according to the bf rules the plaquettes have total @xmath37 magnetization equal to @xmath39 as shown in fig.[configurations](a ) .",
    "the configurations that contain defects violate the ice rules as shown in figs.[configurations](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "classically , as it is well known , the system without defects corresponds to the six vertex model ( see fig.[configurations](a ) ) .",
    "the full classical problem is a 14 vertex model that , as far as we know , has not been solved exactly @xcite .",
    "let us pick , for example , a particular configuration of the system that satisfies the ice rule and let us flip a single proton .",
    "this creates a pair of @xmath40 ( h@xmath41o@xmath5 ) and @xmath42 ( oh@xmath2 ) ionic charges at two neighboring o sites , corresponding to the configurations fig.[configurations](c ) and fig.[configurations](b ) , respectively . strictly at @xmath36",
    ", one can separate the @xmath40 and @xmath42 defects along a zig - zag - like trajectory at no extra energy cost .",

    "the defects are deconfined , which is to say that in the current model corresponds to a quantum disordered phase of ice ( proton liquid ) . however , this analysis is based on a `` naive '' continuum limit of a lattice model and therefore is only applicable deep in the deconfined phase .",
    "it is known from early studies of compact qed in @xmath175 dimensions that this theory has a deconfinement - confinement quantum phase transition at a critical value of the coupling constant @xmath4 , the resonance amplitude @xcite .",
    "qualitatively this phase transition is driven by the proliferation of `` monopole loops '' .",
    "notice that the theory described here , being perturbative in @xmath4 , can not describe the details of the quantum critical point that occurs at finite values of @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , these general arguments do predict the existence of a deconfinement - confinement quantum transition at finite @xmath177 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the actual location of this quantum critical point may be controlled by additional operators not included here , such as the short range part of the dipole interaction , which affect the `` electric '' terms but leave the `` magnetic '' ( flip ) terms untouched .",
    "it is likely that the model we are considering here , which has a single coupling constant @xmath4 , with the electric terms playing the role of a constraint , may be in the deconfined ( or `` maxwell '' ) phase .",
    "the proton phases of ice are characterized by the energy required to separate two defects with opposite sign . in the confined phase ( the ordered phase of ice ) the energy grows linearly with the separation between the ions .",

    ", the phase transition is a metal - insulator transition @xcite and therefore the conductivity of ice should behave quite different in the two different sides of the transition . we should note that in the metallic phase the conduction is due to the collective motion of protons .",

    "so far we have not discussed the problem of lattice vibrations in ice . at finite temperatures",
    "one expects that the thermal motion of the o atoms to affect the properties of the h atoms .",
    "vibrations must be important since the mass of the h atoms are just 16 times smaller than the o atoms and therefore the born - oppenheimer approximation is not guaranteed . in order to incorporate the recoil of the o atoms due to the h motion we assume that the phonon coordinates are coupled to the local proton density . in this case , one has to add an extra term to the hamiltonian of the form : h_p = & - & _ i , , n_i , , q_i,,a + & + & _ i,,a ( + , ) [ phonons ] where @xmath182 are the local phonon coordinates , @xmath183 their canonical momentum , @xmath184 are the phonon frequencies , and @xmath185 the ion mass .",

    "we find : @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    ". describes an ising model in a transverse field coupled to a dissipative environment _  la _ caldeira - leggett @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied recently in the context of quantum phase transitions in metallic magnetic systems @xcite and has very interesting properties .",
    "let us consider the classical case of @xmath196 when the ice rules are obeyed . in this case",
    "the problem can be solved in the basis of @xmath37 : @xmath197 .",
    "it is easy to see that the problem can be diagonalized by shifting operators : b_j , a & = & b_j , a + , + b^_j , a & = & b^_j , a + , and the energy of the problem is given by : e[\\{,n } ] & = & j _",
    "j _ i _ j + & + & _ i , a where the first term is just the energy of the classical state and @xmath12 is the phonon number .",
    "so , the phonon frequencies remain the same but the atoms positions are shifted by @xmath198 .",
    "since there is no proton order when @xmath35 the average lattice shift is zero .",
    "however , for a small value of @xmath43 we see from fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] that @xmath199 acquires an average expectation value leading to an overall shift in the atom positions . at finite temperature",
    "this shift will lead to a discontinuity in the specific heat as it is well known in the case of cooperative transitions of this sort @xcite .",
    "thus , the phase diagram second order phase transition of fig.[phase_diagram ] can be modified substantially . in @xmath154 dimensions",
    "the finite temperature phase transition can change completely to first order while in @xmath175 dimensions a tricritical point must appear at some temperature @xmath200 so that for @xmath201 the phase transition is second order and for @xmath202 the transition becomes first order .",
    "in this paper we have considered the phase diagram of protons in ice .",
    "we have given a detailed picture of two - dimensional ice and provide a qualitative picture of the three - dimensional problem such as the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "we have studied the order - by - disorder effect and ground - state selection by quantum fluctuations , which in this case is the tunneling of protons between the two sites in a hydrogen bond .    in the absence of quantum tunneling",
    ", the number of low energy states grows exponentially with the size of the system and the entropy of the system is macroscopic . in this classical background ,",
    "excited states corresponding to ionic defects can be created and separated without further cost in energy .",
    "as we showed , the presence of quantum fluctuations change considerably this scenario .",
    "the degeneracy of the system is lifted by the order - by - disorder mechanism leading to a well defined ground state .",
    "the technique used to understand the role of quantum fluctuations is based on a mapping of the lattice problem onto a gauge theory .    within the gauge theory",
    "one can describe the behavior of ionic defects as confined or deconfined depending whether the ground state of the system is ordered or disordered , respectively . in a deconfined state",
    "the ionic defects behave like as in a correlated metal , while in the confined phase the system behaves as in an insulator . for",
    "the two - dimensional model , quantum fluctuations select a a two - fold degenerate antiferroelectric ground - state over which ionic excitations are confined .",
    "the situation is different in the three - dimensional case where topological excitations can lead to a deconfined disordered state even at @xmath8 . in such case",
    ", the interplay of quantum fluctuations and the tuning of the microscopic tunneling parameter is expected to give rise to a confinement - deconfinement transition for ionic defects , with their corresponding dramatic effects in the dielectric properties of the material .",
    "furthermore , we have argued that at finite temperatures there will be a phase transition between ordered ( confined ) and disordered ( deconfined ) ice .",
    "the nature of this phase transition depends on the fugacity associated with the topological defects ( monopoles ) and can be either first or second order . in the pyroclore lattice",
    "the most likely scenario is that there is a tricritical point separating a first order from a second order phase transition ( see fig.[phase_diagram](b ) ) that should be observable .",
    "while similar problems have already being addressed in terms of spin models @xcite , the ice scenario brings a new perspective to this kind of phenomenology due the more accessible experimental possibilities than in frustrated spins systems @xcite .",
    "it is clear from fig.[phase_diagram](b ) that the way to tune the phase transition is by changing the value of the proton hopping energy @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends on the overlap of the proton wavefunction between the two sites in the hydrogen bond .",
    "since the mass of the proton is large its wavefunction is more localized than in the electronic case and we expect that @xmath4 is exponentially sensitive on the changes in the distance between o atoms . one clear way to experimentally change @xmath4 is then by applying hydrostatic pressure @xmath44 to an ice crystal at fixed temperature @xmath3 , starting from the disordered phase , and measuring the ice conductivity or dielectric response as a function of pressure .",
    "one expects that the proton ordering discussed here occurs at lower pressures than the well - known structural phase transitions of ice @xcite .",
    "another way to change the o - o distance is by using `` chemical pressure '' @xcite",
    ". one can dope water with salts like koh that while in solution become k@xmath5 and ho@xmath2 .",
    "when in the solid phase the k@xmath5 ion becomes trapped into the `` cages '' of o atoms while the ho@xmath2 ions are assimilated into the ice lattice .",
    "thus , in this case , doping also introduces charges into the lattice structure and the ground state is no longer neutral .",
    "furthermore , since the k@xmath5 ions spread randomly over the ice lattice , this kind of doping also introduces disorder in the system .",
    "the attractive interaction between the positive k@xmath5 ions and the negative o@xmath6 atoms of the ice structure lead to a local decrease of the volume of ice `` cages '' , to an average decrease in the h - bond distance , and to an average increase in @xmath4 .",
    "so , in first approximation the introduction of koh is somewhat equivalent to the horizontal axis in fig.[phase_diagram ] .",
    "however , because there is introduction of charges and disorder in the system , the horizontal axis in fig.[phase_diagram ] is only roughly the concentration of koh .",
    "doping experiments with koh have been performed more than @xmath203 years ago @xcite in order to understand the famous @xmath204 k anomaly observed in the temperature dependence of the specific heat of undoped ice @xcite .",
    "the specific heat of pure ice at low temperatures increases with temperature as @xmath205 which is the characteristic of phonons in the material .",
    "however , it has been known for a long time that hexagonal ice ( ice - ih ) has a bump in the specific heat at @xmath206 k that was a theoretical mystery @xcite . by doping pure ice with koh it was shown by kawada in the 1970 s that the specific heat bump is actually a very slow phase transition into an ordered proton state that was called ice xi @xcite .",
    "permittivity experiments in doped ice have confirmed this scenario @xcite .",
    "specific heat measurements in koh doped ice showed a strong and highly hysteretic first order phase transition with a substantial loss of entropy in the low temperature phase @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of ice have confirmed the ordering transition @xcite . while the critical temperature is weakly dependent on the amount of koh , the loss of entropy is dependent on the koh concentration .",
    "furthermore , in accordance with our discussion in the previous section , the first order phase transition is associated with lattice distortions as seen in recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "hence , our theory provides a possible theoretical explanation for the phase transition between ice - ih and ice - xi .",
    "we believe that the first order phase transition observed in the experiments is the one described in fig.[phase_diagram](b ) and it would be very interesting to find out whether the quantum critical point can be studied by further doping of koh or by application of pressure .",
    "our theory indicates that at @xmath207 and @xmath208 the protons in ice - ih would make an unique state of matter , namely , a quantum proton liquid , with deconfined ion excitations .",
