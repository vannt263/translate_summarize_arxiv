    "in this paper we study mechanical balance laws for fully nonlinear and dispersive shallow - water waves .",
    "in particular , the system of equations with variable bathymetry is considered .",
    "this system was originally derived for one - dimensional waves over a horizontal bottom in 1953 by f. serre @xcite .",
    "several years later , the same system was rederived by su and gardner @xcite . in 1976 ,",
    "green and naghdi @xcite derived a two - dimensional fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive system for an uneven bottom while in one spatial dimension seabra - santos et al .",
    "@xcite derived the generalization of the serre system with variable bathymetry .",
    "lannes and bonneton derived several other systems including the equations using a new formulation of the water wave problem , @xcite . for more information and generalizations of the equations we refer to @xcite and the references therein , while we refer to the paper by barthlemy @xcite for an extensive review .    the system and several variants of it are extensively used in coastal modeling @xcite . in the present contribution",
    ", the focus is on one aspect of the equations which has not received much attention so far , namely the derivation and use of associated mechanical balance equations , and in particular a differential energy balance equation .",
    "while it is known that the equations admit four local conservation equations if the bed is even @xcite , it appears that the connection to mechanical balance laws of the original euler equations has not been firmly established so far .",
    "here we show that the first three conservation laws of the equations arise as approximations of mechanical balance laws in the context of the euler equations , both in the case of even beds , and in the case of nontrivial bathymetry .",
    "the fourth conservation law has been shown to arise from a kinematic identity similar to kelvin s circulation theorem @xcite .",
    "let us first review some modeling issues regarding the system .",
    "suppose @xmath0 denotes a typical amplitude , and @xmath1 a typical wavelength of a wavefield under study .",
    "suppose also that @xmath2 represents the average water depth . in order to be a valid description of such a situation",
    ", the equations require the shallow water condition , @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the range of validity of the weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive boussinesq equations is limited to waves with small amplitude and large wavelength , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this scaling regime ,",
    "one also finds the weakly nonlinear , fully dispersive whitham equation @xcite .",
    "the equations can be derived by depth - averaging the euler equations and truncating the resulting set of equations at @xmath6 without making any assumptions on the order of @xmath7 , other than @xmath8 .    in their dimensionless and",
    "scaled form the equations can be written as    [ eq : serre1 ] @xmath9_{x}=0\\ , \\label{eq : serre1a } \\\\ & \\bar{u}_{t } + \\bar{u}\\bar{u}_{x } + g \\eta_{x}+ \\frac{1}{h } \\left [ h^{2 } \\big ( { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{3 } } } { \\mathcal{p}}+ { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{2 } } } { \\mathcal{q}}\\big ) \\right]_x",

    "figure 1 ) . for a review of the derivation and the basic properties of this system",
    "we also refer to @xcite .    in the case of small - amplitude waves , i.e.  if @xmath24 , the equations reduce to peregrine s system @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of very long waves , i.e.  @xmath25 ,",
    "the dispersive terms disappear , and the system reduces to the nondispersive shallow water equations .    the system for waves over a flat bottom possesses solitary and cnoidal wave solutions given in closed form .",
    "for example , the solitary wave with speed @xmath26 can be written as    [ eq : solwave ] @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for more information about the solitary and cnoidal waves and their dynamical properties we refer to @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the system has a hamiltonian structure , even in the case of two - dimensional waves over an uneven bed cf .",
    "specifically , any solution @xmath33 of ( [ eq : serre1 ] ) conserves the hamiltonian functional @xmath34 { \\bar{u}}^2- { { \\textstyle{1\\over3}}}\\left[h^3 { \\bar{u}}_{x}\\right]_x { \\bar{u}}~ dx\\ , \\ ] ] in the sense that @xmath35 .",
    "note however that ( [ eq : serre1a ] ) , ( [ eq : serre1b ] ) are recovered only if a non - canonical symplectic structure matrix is used .",
    "while in many simplified models equations , the hamiltonian functions does not represent the mechanical energy of the wave problem @xcite , in the case of , the hamiltonian does represent the approximate total energy of the wave system .",
    "thus the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath36 where the integrand @xmath37{\\bar{u}}^2       - { { \\textstyle{1\\over3}}}\\left[h^3 { \\bar{u}}_{x}\\right]_x { \\bar{u}}\\right ) \\ ] ] is the depth - integrated energy density . in the present paper , we also identify a local depth - integrated energy flux @xmath38 , such that an equation of the form @xmath39 is satisfied approximately .",
    "the procedure of finding the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath38 follows a similar outline as the derivations in @xcite for a class of boussinesq systems and @xcite for the kdv equation .",
    "expressions for energy functionals associated to boussinesq systems have also been developed in @xcite .",
    "the analytical results are put to use in the study of undular bores .",
    "it is well known that the shallow - water theory for bores predicts an energy loss @xcite . in an undular bore ,",
    "the energy is thought to be disseminated through an increasing number of oscillations behind the bore , and the traditional point of view is that dissipation must also have an effect here @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies @xcite have shown that if dispersion is included into the model equations , then the energy loss experienced by an undular bore can be accounted for without making appeal to dissipative mechanisms .",
    "indeed , it was argued in @xcite that the energy loss in an undular bore could be explained wholly within the realm of conservative dynamics by investigating a higher - order dispersive system , and monitoring the associated energy functional .",
    "however , there was a technical problem in the analysis in these works , as the energy functional was not the same as the one required by the more in - depth analysis in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the energy functional found in @xcite did not reduce to the shallow - water theory in the correct way . in the current contribution",
    ", it is our purpose to remedy this situation by using the system which reduces in the correct way to the shallow - water equations , and also features exact energy conservation in the case of a flat bed .",
    "the numerical method to be used is a standard galerkin / for the equations with reflective boundary conditions extending the numerical method presented in @xcite . for the sake of completeness we mention that there are several numerical methods applied to boundary value problems of the equations .",
    "for example finite volume @xcite , finite differences @xcite , spectral @xcite and galerkin methods @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a review of the derivation of the equations based on @xcite is presented in section [ sec : derivation ] .",
    "the derivation of the mass , momentum and energy balance laws in the asymptotic order of the equations is presented in section [ sec : laws ] .",
    "applications to undular bores and solitary waves are discussed in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "the numerical method to be used used in this paper is presented briefly in [ app : a ] .",
    "before introducing the balance laws for the equations , we briefly review the derivation of the equations from the euler equations following the work @xcite , but in the case of a general bathymetry .",
    "this well known derivation is included here to set the stage for the development of the approximate mechanical balance laws in the next section .",
    "we consider an inviscid and incompressible fluid , and assume that the fluid flow is irrotational and two - dimensional . let @xmath41 be a typical amplitude , @xmath1 a typical wavelength and @xmath42 a typical water depth .",
    "we perform the change of variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which yields non - dimensional independent variables identified by tildes , where @xmath46 represents the horizontal and @xmath47 the vertical coordinate .",

    "it is worth noting that the conservation of the asymptotic approximation to the total energy with nontrivial bathymetry in the fully nonlinear regime is satisfied by the solutions of the equations exactly .",

    "is described in @xcite , and in @xcite an empirical critical value @xmath170 is suggested in order to determine the breaking of an undular bore .",
    "however the exact characterization of the transition between these states still remains unclear .",
    "some of the divergence in the results on the critical bore strength might be explained by the observation that one single nondimensional number may not be sufficient to classify all bores .",
    "for example , in @xcite , a hyperbolic shear - flow model is suggested which allows the classification of bores with an additional parameter depending on the strength of the developing shear flow near the bore front .",
    "the connection between the initial bore strength and the ensuing highest undulation is fairly well understood .",
    "using whitham modulation theory @xcite , it can be shown that if viscosity is neglected , the amplitude of the leading wave behind the bore front is exactly twice the initial ratio of flow depths @xcite .",
    "this result agrees well with experimental findings .",
    "for example , the amplitude of the leading wave found experimentally in @xcite was 2.06 times the initial amplitude ratio .",
    "in this section we present a numerical study of the energy balance of undular bores for the equations .",
    "it is well known that a sharp transition in both flow depth and flow velocity which conserves both mass and momentum necessitates a loss of energy across the front .",
    "the standard argument essentially relies on an inviscid shallow - water theory and the examination of exact weak solutions of the shallow - water equations @xcite .",
    "given these assumptions , it is natural to explain the energy loss across the bore front by pointing to the physical effects neglected in the shallow - water theory , such as viscosity , frequency dispersion , and turbulent flow",
    ". indeed , in strong bores , turbulent dissipation accounts for the lion s share of energy dissipation , and a long - wave model can only give a first approximation of the dynamics .",
    "most of the work investigating the energy loss has focused on weak undular bores , where long - wave models can be expected to yield an accurate description of the flow .",
    "the loss of energy in weak bores has been explained by the creation of oscillations in the free surface behind the front , but it was noted in @xcite that an additional dissipation mechanism is needed . in @xcite ,",
    "the bottom boundary layer was invoked to explain this required additional energy loss , but it was noted in @xcite that invoking frictional effects to explain the energy loss experienced by a conservative system was not consistent .    however , as already mentioned , there was a slight technical problem in the analysis of @xcite , since the energy functional @xmath171~ d\\tilde{x}\\ , \\ ] ] used in that work could not be obtained in the framework of the asymptotically correct mechanical balance laws derived in @xcite . indeed , the expressions for the energy and energy flux associated to the boussinesq system which were derived in @xcite are @xmath172 and the non - dimensional energy flux ( corrected for the work rate due to pressure forces ) as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the nondimensional horizontal velocity component at height @xmath175 in the water column .",
    "it is apparent that as @xmath25 , these expressions do not reduce correctly to the corresponding expressions of the shallow - water theory .",
    "however , since the expressions ( [ egn ] ) and ( [ qegn ] ) do reduce to the correct shallow - water equivalents , the analysis of the energy loss in the undular bore can be made precise in the context of the system .",
    "the numerical method that was used to perform the numerical simulations in this paper is detailed in [ app : a ] .",
    "it is also noted that for simplicity s sake we consider the water density @xmath176 .",
