    "47  tuc ( ngc  104 ) is a populous , metal rich , globular cluster located at relatively small distance from the sun . in the recent compilation harris ( 1996 )",
    "lists for it metallicity @xmath7}=-0.76 $ ] , absolute visual magnitude @xmath8 , distance modulus @xmath9 and extinction @xmath10 .",
    "the cluster belongs to the population of disk clusters ( zinn and west 1984 ) .",
    "high galactic latitude of 47  tuc ( @xmath11 ) along with its closeness make it particularly attractive object for detailed studies .",
    "the major , ccd based , photometric investigations of 47  tuc include @xmath12 photometry by hesser et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and @xmath0 photometry by alcaino & liller ( 1987 ) .",
    "the cluster was a subject of numerous projects conducted with the help of _ hst_. the most recent contributions include identification of a population of eclipsing binary stars in the cluster center ( edmonds et al .  1996 ; minniti et al .",
    "1997 ) , search for cataclysmic binaries ( shara et al .",
    "1996 ) , study of the luminosity function ( santiago et al .",
    "1996 ) and spectroscopic study of a blue straggler located in the cluster center ( shara , saffer & livio 1997 ) .",
    "kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) used ground - based data to identify several new variables , including 12 eclipsing binaries , in the outer parts of the cluster .    in this paper",
    "we report medium - deep @xmath0 photometry for an eastern section of 47  tuc .",
    "these observations were aimed at : a ) derivation of a luminosity function for an upper main - sequence stars and subgiants ; b ) identification of blue stragglers in the outer parts of the cluster ; c ) search for candidates for blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "the luminosity function derived from our data will be published elsewhere ( wysocka 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "below we concentrate on search for blue stragglers and other blue stars as well as on derivation of the distance modulus of the cluster .",
    "the observations presented here were obtained using 1024@xmath1 tektronix ccd ( tek2 camera ) attached to the 2.5 m dupont telescope of the las campanas observatory .",
    "the field of view of the camera was @xmath13  arcmin@xmath1 with the scale of 0.235 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the data were collected on 4 nights of july 1114 , 1993 .",
    "18 partly overlapping fields covering eastern part of the cluster were imaged through @xmath0 filters . a schematic chart showing location of these fields is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the total surface of the observed area of the cluster equals about 220  arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the following sequence of exposures was collected for each sub - field : @xmath14 - 600  s , @xmath15 - 300  s , @xmath2 - 300  s. additionally , shorter exposures were obtained for sub - fields f19 and f10 .",
    "photometry and equatorial coordinates for all stars detected are available in electronic form from ftp://www.astro.princeton.edu/kaluzny/globular/47tuc_bvi or ftp://www.astrouw.edu.pl/pub/jka/globular/47tuc_bvi ] the seeing ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 arcsec with a median value of about 1.5 arcsec .",
    "the instrumental profile photometry was extracted using daophot / allstar package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the point spread function varying linearly with coordinates was applied .",
    "the instrumental @xmath16 photometry derived for sub - fields f1 - 20 was transformed to the common instrumental system defined by photometry of sub - field f4 .",
    "the offsets of the zero points of the photometry obtained for individual sub - fields were determined on a base of stars from the overlapping regions of adjacent sub - fields .",
    "calibration to the standard @xmath17 system was performed using photometry of landolt ( 1992 ) fields , observed over the whole run . on the night of july 12 , 1993",
    ", we observed three landolt fields containing a total of 14 standards .",
    "these fields were observed at air - masses spanning the range @xmath18 .",
    "based on the aperture photometry of the standard stars we adopted the following relations :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is an airmass and lower - case letters refer to the instrumental magnitudes normalized to 1  s exposures .",
    "the overall quality of the adopted transformation is illustrated in fig .  2 where the magnitude and color residuals are plotted for the standard stars .",
    "the last step was determination of aperture corrections for the sub - field f4 .",
    "we estimate that probable errors of the zero points of our photometry of 47  tuc do not exceed @xmath21mag for magnitudes and colors .",
    "the derived @xmath0 photometry of 47  tuc is presented in the form of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in figs .  3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "3 shows data for all but two most crowded sub - fields f19 and f10 .",
    "photometry for sub - fields f19 and f10 is shown in figs .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "presented cmd s are not complete in the sense that for each of sub - fields objects with unusually large errors of photometry for their magnitude were discarded .",
    "the cluster region observed by us neither overlaps with the fields observed by hesser et el .",
    "( 1987 ) nor with the field observed by alcaino & liller ( 1987 ) . hence it is impossible to compare directly our photometry with the photometry published by these authors , but indirect comparison is possible . in fig .",
    "6 we show @xmath22 cmd based on our data for the sub - field f4 with over - imposed fiducial relation published by hesser et al .",
    "( 1987 ; table ix in their paper ) .",
    "it has to be noted that parts of the fiducial relation describing location of the horizontal branch and main sequence are based on ccd data while the subgiants and lower giant branch are defined based on the photographic data .",
    "the overall agreement is good although a systematic discrepancy in color is visible at the bottom of the subgiant branch . the average color for rgb stars plotted in fig",
    ".  3 is @xmath23 which is marginally bluer than the average color measured by hesser et al .",
    "( 1987 ) who obtained @xmath24 and @xmath25 for their fields f3 and f4 .",
    "our photometry for main - sequence stars is consistent with results of alcaino & liller ( 1987 ) who obtained @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the colors of the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "our data imply @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in fig .",
    "7 we compare our @xmath30 photometry for rgb and sub - giant branch with the data from armandroff ( 1988 ) and da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) .",
    "there are no noticeable systematic differences between these 3 sets of data .",
    "most of the thoroughly investigated globular clusters are known to harbor more or less rich populations of blue stragglers ( bss ) ( eg .",
    "ferraro , fusi pecci & bellazzini 1995 ) there seems to be a correlation between a given cluster concentration and the properties of its bss population . in sparse clusters a substantial fraction of their bss",
    "can be found in peripheral regions , although generally bss are more concentrated than `` ordinary '' member stars ( eg . subdwarfs ) . in clusters with very high central densities",
    "bss have been observed almost exclusively in their central regions .",
    "particularly interesting is the case of the nearby cluster m3 where there is an evidence for presence of two populations of bss of different origin ( ferraro et al .",
    "it has been suggested that bss observed in cores of globular clusters are formed preferentially by stellar collisions while bss observed in loose clusters are formed by merging of primordial binaries ( ferraro , fusi pecci & bellazzini 1995 ; sandquist , bolte & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "paresce et al .  (",
    "1991 ) reported identification of 22 bss in the core of 47  tuc , the first detection of bss in a globular cluster core by _",
    "hst_. in contrast hesser al .",
    "( 1987 ) noted the complete lack of possible bss in the out - of - core regions the cluster .",
    "recently kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998 ) surveyed a large fraction of the cluster and detected 12 eclipsing binaries of which most are likely bss .",
    "several candidates for bss are visible in the cmd s presented in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 . as photometry shown in figs .",
    "4 and 5 is relatively noisy we limited our attention to the data displayed in fig .",
    "an expanded view of that figure showing region around the main - sequence turnoff is shown in fig .  8 .",
    "one may note presence of an apparent bss clump at @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in table 1",
    "we list photometry and equatorial coordinates for 8 stars forming that clump .",
    "star bss7 has been identified as a contact binary by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998 ; variable oglegc226 ) .",
    "hence it is a likely binary bss .",
    "the finding charts allowing identification of 8 identified bss candidates are shown in fig .",
    "recently shara , saffer & livio ( 1997 ) used a spectrum obtained with the _ hst _ to derive absolute parameters for one of bss located in the cluster core .",
    "we note in that context that four of our bss candidates are relatively isolated , un - crowded objects .",
    "they are excellent objects for spectroscopic studies with ground - based telescopes .",
    "as one of the closest globular clusters 47  tuc is particularly well suited for studies aimed at comparison of properties of individual stars belonging to inner and outer bss populations .",
    ".photometry and coordinates for blue straggler candidates [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^ \" , ]     object b7 is too faint to be a candidate for a hot subdwarf belonging to 47  tuc .",
    "it was included in table 2 because it is noticeably bluer than an upper - main sequence stars from smc which can be seen in fig .",
    "although b7 is located in the densest surveyed sub - field its photometry is quite reliable as luckily that star is a relatively un - crowded object ( see fig .",
    "the derived magnitude and color of b7 are consistent with a hypothesis that it is a cataclysmic variable belonging to 47  tuc .",
    "so far only one cataclysmic variable was identified in the cluster ( paresce & de marchi 1994 ; see also shara et al .",
    "1996 ) . given an unexpected paucity of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters ( eg .",
    "shara et al .",
    "1996 ) it may be worth to examine closer nature of b7 .",
    "the star can be monitored for possible variability and also its spectrum can be acquired with the ground - based telescopes .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .",
    "we have identified 8 promising candidates for blue stragglers in the outer parts of 47  tuc .",
    "four of these stars are uncrowded objects being easy targets for detailed spectroscopic studies with ground - based telescopes . 2 .",
    "five candidates for stars from the extended horizontal branch of 47  tuc were identified in the surveyed field .",
    "however , these objects may be as well b - type main sequence stars belonging to the halo of the smc .",
    "one relatively bright object being a candidate for blue horizontal branch star was also found .",
    "a faint blue star was identified close to the cluster center .",
    "its apparent magnitude and color are consistent with the hypothesis that it is a cataclysmic variable belonging to the cluster .",
    "the average @xmath2-band magnitude for stars forming the red giant branch clump is determined at @xmath3mag .",
    "this in turn implies distance modulus of the cluster @xmath4mag ."
