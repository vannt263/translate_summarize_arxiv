    "<S> the effect of alkaline earth substitution on structural parameters was studied in high - quality single crystals of ba@xmath0sr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  and sr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2grown by the self - flux method . </S>",
    "<S> the results of single - crystal and powder x - ray diffraction measurements suggest a continuous monotonic decrease of both @xmath3- and @xmath4-axis lattice parameters , the @xmath5 tetragonal ratio , and the unit cell volume with decreasing alkaline earth atomic radius as expected by vegard s law . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the system experiences a continuously increasing chemical pressure effect in traversing the phase diagram from @xmath6 in ba@xmath0sr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  to @xmath7 in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in iron - based compounds has attracted much interest . </S>",
    "<S> the parent phases of these compounds generally show antiferromagnetic order that onsets between 130  k and 200  k , with superconductivity emerging when the antiferromagnetic order of the parent compounds is suppressed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this proximity of magnetic and superconducting order parameters is widely thought to be a key argument for an unconventional pairing mechanism , likely mediated by spin fluctuations  @xcite similar to the cuprates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in strong contrast to the copper oxides , superconductivity in iron arsenides can be induced without changing the carrier concentration , either by applying external pressure  @xcite or by isovalent chemical substitution . </S>",
    "<S> the highest @xmath8  achieved so far in these materials is @xmath9  k in smo@xmath0f@xmath1feas  @xcite and ( sr , ca)feasf  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen - free feas - based compounds with the thcr@xmath2si@xmath2-type ( 122 ) structure also exhibit superconductivity induced by chemical substitution of alkali or transition metal ions  @xcite , the application of large pressures  @xcite , or lattice strain @xcite , with transition temperatures as high as @xmath10  k.    for the 122 phase , superconductivity has been induced by substituting fe with not only 3@xmath11-transition metals such as co and ni , but also some of the 4@xmath11- and 5@xmath11-transition metals . </S>",
    "<S> recently , ru , ir , and pt substitution for fe were also shown to induce superconductivity in srfe@xmath2as@xmath2  and bafe@xmath2as@xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity with @xmath8@xmath12 31  k has also been shown to occur by isovalent substitution of p for as  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the opportunity to tune magnetic character without nominally changing charge carrier concentrations , for instance making the interpretation of transport coefficients much simpler than in the case of charge doping .    in order to investigate the possibility of applying uniform chemical pressure in a continuous manner , </S>",
    "<S> we have synthesized the series of solid solutions ba@xmath0sr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  and sr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2by substituting isovalent alkaline earth atoms , and investigated the evolution of the crystal structure by high - resolution powder and single - crystal x - ray diffraction . here </S>",

    "<S> single - crystal samples of ba@xmath0sr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  and sr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  were grown using the feas self - flux method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fe was first separately pre - reacted with as via solid - state reaction of fe ( 99.999% ) powder with as ( 99.99% ) powders in a quartz tube of partial atmospheric pressure of ar . </S>",
    "<S> the precursor materials were mixed with elemental sr ( 99.95% ) with either ba ( 99.95% ) or ca ( 99.95% ) in the ratio 4:1@xmath13 , placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in a quartz tube under partial ar pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture was heated to 1150@xmath14c , slow - cooled to a lower temperature and then quenched to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> typical dimensions of as - grown single crystal specimen are @xmath12100  @xmath15 m thickness and up to 5  mm width . chemical analysis was performed using both energy- and wavelength - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds and wds ) .    </S>",
    "<S> both eds and wds analysis of all ba@xmath0sr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  and sr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  samples showed the proper 1:2:2 stoichiometry in all specimens reported herein , with no indication of impurity phases . </S>",

    "<S> this fact indicates that the whole ( ba , sr , ca)fe@xmath2as@xmath2  series progression experiences a uniform chemical pressure effect due to the reduction of the cation size that follows vegard s law , as expected for the decreasing ionic radii of ba , sr and ca , respectively .    the lattice parameters of ba@xmath0sr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  obtained in our experiments are consistent with the data reported in a recent study  @xcite , which found a systematic increase of @xmath26 with increasing sr content and no superconductivity . on the other hand , substitution of arsenic for the smaller phosphorus atoms , </S>",

    "<S> x - ray diffraction and data refinement reveal that the entire ( ba , sr , ca)fe@xmath2as@xmath2series progresses according to vegard s law , experiencing a uniform chemical pressure effect due to substitution with reduced ionic size from ba to sr to ca , respectively . </S>"
