    "a derivation of a theoretical , time average , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , planckian temperature @xmath0 of the universe and an explanation of the deviation of the measured temperature @xmath2 k @xcite from @xmath0 remains a challenge .",
    "the cobe result showed the cmb radiation spectrum is very close to a pure planck function .",
    "the standard cosmological , `` big bang '' cosmological models ( bbm ) view the cmb as a relic of an era of the universe when energy density was very high . as the universe expanded , the temperature declined adiabaticly .",
    "therefore , the bbm of the cmb temperature is inversely proportional to the cosmological scale factor such that @xmath4 is constant in all directions and redshifts .    in inflationary models",
    ", a scalar field causes the early , accelerated expansion of space .",
    "the inflationary universe scenario solves the horizon and flatness problems and the related entropy problem .",
    "inflation models are also models for the origin of the large  scale structure of the universe and predicted an almost scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "inflation models have serious conceptual problems \\{see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) for a summary}. @xcite found evidence for a transition at redshift @xmath5 = 0.46@xmath60.13 from a cosmic deceleration to a cosmic acceleration and for a `` cosmic jerk '' at the transition .",
    "the `` steady state '' models ( ssm ) posit the universe has always existed and is continually expanding and contracting . therefore , energy and matter must be continually being created in intergalactic space and the temperature of the universe must be continually changing @xcite .",
    "the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature is considered to have falsified ssm .    a cyclic universe model ( cu ) has recently been reintroduced @xcite .",
    "the cu posits the universe continually expands and contracts with bounces in a four dimensional scalar field .",
    "a major component of cu is that events in previous cycles help shape events in following cycles .",
    "the scalar potential model ( spm ) suggests the existence of a massless scalar potential @xmath7 field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "matter and @xmath7 originates from sources and goes to sinks .",
    "the spm was created to be consistent with the morphology  radius and the intragalactic medium cluster observations of galaxies .",
    "several differences among galaxy types suggest that sources are located in spiral galaxies and that sinks are located in early type , lenticular , and irregular galaxies .",
    "the spm suggests source and sink galaxy pairs , triples , groups , and clusters ( herein `` cells '' ) are organized with sources surrounding the sinks @xcite .",
    "because the distance between galaxies is larger than the diameter of a galaxy , the sources were considered as point ( monopole ) sources .",
    "the gradient of the @xmath7 field exerts a force @xmath8 on matter that is repulsive of matter . in source galaxies",
    ", @xmath8 repels matter from the galaxy . in sink galaxies",
    ", @xmath8 repels matter into the galaxy .",
    "the b  band luminosity @xmath9 of matter in source galaxies was considered proportional to the source strength @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the matter and @xmath7 emitted by a source are proportional to @xmath10 . for the sample galaxies , the ratio of @xmath9 to the b  band luminosity @xmath11 of sink galaxies approaches @xmath12 .",
    "the spm was applied to redshift and discrete redshift measurements @xcite . in volumes close to a source , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance to a source .    in this paper @xmath13 and",
    "the intragalactic medium cluster observations suggests the diffusion ( heat ) equation applies to the flow of energy and matter from sources to sinks .",
    "because the matter ejected from source galaxies to sink galaxies is related to @xmath10 , the feedback control mechanism of matter in a cell and , therefore , of cell radiation temperature @xmath15 must be in the sink .",
    "the heat equation is solved with the boundary conditions of spm source and sink characteristics , with simplified cell characteristics , and of zero initial temperature .",
    "the universe is a collection of cells .",
    "the cmb radiation is black body radiation with the cells acting as radiators and absorbers .",
    "conventional thermodynamics is applied to calculate @xmath16  k .",
    "the @xmath15 and matter content of cells are finely controlled by a feedback mechanism . because time is required for matter to flow from sources to sinks , the @xmath15 cycles about @xmath0 after an initial growth phase .",
    "the object of this article is to examine the cmb radiation temperature within the context of the spm . in section  [ sec : model ] , the spm @xmath15 calculation equation is developed and @xmath0 is calculated .",
    "the discussion and conclusion is in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "posit energy @xmath17 is injected into our universe ( u ) through source portals from hot , thermodynamic reservoirs ( hrs ) .",
    "the macro thermodynamic processes were considered the same for all sources .",
    "the @xmath17 flows away from the source .",
    "some matter remains near the source as a galaxy and some matter is removed from the source galaxy by @xmath8 .",
    "gravitational forces @xmath18 cause the matter removed from galaxies to concentrate in a source  less galaxy .",
    "eventually , enough matter becomes concentrated to initiate a sink . because a minimum amount of matter around a sink is required to initiate a sink , a minimum amount of energy @xmath19 and matter in a cell is also required",
    ". the sink ejects energy @xmath20 out of u through sink portals to cold , thermodynamic reservoirs ( crs ) .",
    "the sink strength @xmath21 depends on the amount of matter in the local sink volume .",
    "this is a negative feedback mechanism that tightly controls the energy @xmath22 in u. therefore , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is time since the start of u ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are indexes ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the total number of sources and sinks , respectively , in u ; and @xmath29 means `` absolute value of '' .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium for u is when @xmath30 therefore , if @xmath31 is larger than the thermodynamic equilibrium value , @xmath32 increases which reduces @xmath31 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath31 is smaller than the thermodynamic equilibrium value , @xmath32 decreases which increases @xmath31 .    the observation from earth of the multiple source and",
    "sink galaxies requires the hr to be common for all sources .",
    "otherwise , conceptual difficulties similar to the domain - wall problem , the horizon problem , and the flatness problem of bbm occur .",
    "therefore , the energy from all sources is causally correlated and coherent .",
    "because there is a distance between source and sink , the matter requires time to move from the source to the sink , time to cool , time to penetrate the elliptical galaxy to the sink , and time to change @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the cells are not in internal , thermal equilibrium .    for simplicity",
    ", consider only one cell and posit : ( 1 ) the cell consists of a distribution of sources around the core of sinks .",
    "the core sinks were considered a monopole ( point ) sink .",
    "( 2 ) a gaussian surface may be constructed enclosing the volume wherein all matter flows to the sink core .",
    "the gaussian surface is the border of the cell .",
    "( 3 ) the temperature @xmath33 within a cell is a function of distance @xmath34 from the sink core and @xmath24 [ @xmath35 .",
    "( 4 ) the volume of the cell may be characterized by a linear dimension @xmath36 wherein @xmath36 is the @xmath34 of the gaussian surface and a minimum . the cells are not required to share boundaries .",
    "the transparency of intercell space supports this assumption .",
    "( 5 ) the matter in a cell is gained and lost only at the sources and sinks of the cell , respectively .",
    "that is , the matter flux across the gaussian surface is zero at all points of the surface .",
    "( 6 ) only radiation and @xmath7 may leave the cell . ( 7 ) the @xmath34 to the outermost source is less than @xmath36 .",
    "( 8) the @xmath33 is proportional to the matter density in a cell .",
    "( 9 ) the intragalactic medium cluster observations and @xmath13 suggests the diffusion ( heat ) equation applies to the flow of matter from sources to sinks .",
    "( 10 ) the initial temperature of u is zero everywhere . (",
    "11 ) the sink feedback control mechanism is the amount of matter around the sink that controls the amount of radiation @xmath37 per unit area per unit time emitted from the cell through the gaussian surface . because the matter transport from the sources to the sink core is considerably slower than the speed of light , the matter transport and cooling ( conductivity @xmath38 ) are the time determining factors of @xmath37 .",
    "( 12 ) because only @xmath39 was of concern , the initial condition of the distribution of the sources and sinks was ignored .",
    "therefore , the @xmath40 for values of @xmath41 was not calculated .",
    "( 13 ) the @xmath37 is proportional the departure of @xmath15 from @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a function of the rate of matter input of the sources in a cell and was considered a constant .",
    "( 14 ) the radiant energy and @xmath7 from other cells influences @xmath38 .",

    "there is no other external energy in u.    posit each cell is a radiator like in a black box and all the cells are at the same @xmath15 .",
    "the redshift of photons is caused by a loss of energy from the photon to the universe caused by the @xmath7 field @xcite .",
    "the lost photon energy must remain in u and be reabsorbed by u. full thermalization requires such an emission and absorption process .",
    "therefore , one of two possibilities exists : ( 1 ) all cells were formed at the same time and follow identical evolution paths . that is , there is a universal time clock .",
    "( 2 ) a communication exists to equalize the temperature of each cell with other cells by means of a feedback mechanism .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 field from a neighboring cell may change the @xmath8 in a cell that changes the rate of matter transport , hence @xmath26 .",
    "the latter may provide a mechanism for the `` cosmic jerk '' suggested by @xcite .    when @xmath50 , there is excess @xmath31 .",
    "as @xmath15 decreases to values less than @xmath0 , the excess @xmath31 is removed from u. therefore , @xmath51 converges ( `` hunts '' ) to @xmath0 after a number of cycles that depend on @xmath47 .",
    "if the value of @xmath47 is too low , @xmath52 always . if @xmath47 is too high , the hunting will diverge and the universe will be unstable .",
    "the findings of @xcite suggest @xmath15 is oscillating about @xmath0 after @xmath19 is established .",
    "therefore , the process of increasing @xmath31 above @xmath19 is reversible and u is behaving as a thermodynamic , carnot engine at 100% efficiency",
    ".    the kelvin temperature scale is defined for a carnot engine such that the ratio of two kelvin temperatures are to each other as the energies ( heats ) absorbed and rejected by u , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the energy in cr and hr , respectively ; @xmath56 and @xmath56 are the time average temperature of the cr and hr , respectively ; and the units of @xmath0 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are kelvin .",
    "the amount of heat in each reservoir is proportional to the amount of heat in the previous reservoir .",
    "also , if the zero point of the kelvin scale for u is defined as @xmath56 , then @xmath58",
    "within the context of the spm , the puzzling cosmic acceleration @xcite and cosmic deceleration @xcite may be explained if the cells are considered as an ideal gas in free expansion . because the cells are not in thermal equilibrium ( @xmath59 ) , both the @xmath7 pressure on matter and volume of the universe follow @xmath15 .",
