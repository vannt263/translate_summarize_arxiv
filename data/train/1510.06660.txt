    "determining the upper critical field ( @xmath0 ) , where superconductivity ceases in a type - ii superconductor , is one of the most important steps for gathering an understanding of unconventional superconductivity including the pairing mechanism , the pairing strength , as well as the coherence length . particularly , the temperature dependence of @xmath0 reflects the underlying electronic structure responsible for superconductivity and provides valuable information on the microscopic origin of pair breaking , which is important for various application purposes , too .",
    "most iron - based superconductors have a moderate @xmath0 , within the range of non - destructive pulsed high magnetic fields available in current technology @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain @xmath0 and its anisotropy @xmath12 down to the zero - temperature limit experimentally , rather than by use of imprecise theoretical extrapolations from data near the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath13 ) only .",
    "although all iron - based superconductors have a layered structure .",
    "the 122 and 11 families always show a nearly isotropic @xmath14 at zero temperature [ @xmath15 @xcite , and the 111 family has a slightly higher @xmath16 @xcite , while the anisotropy of @xmath14 for the 1111 family with the highest @xmath13 is not well determined yet due to the very high @xmath0 ( above 100 t)@xcite .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that , until now most results are from optimally doped compounds or intrinsically superconducting samples and reports on the doping dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath17 at low temperature in iron pnictides are scarce .",
    "bafe@xmath18as@xmath3 ( ba-122 ) , as a parent phase of the iron - based superconductors with a double - layered structure , can be doped either with holes by replacing ba with k / na or with electrons by substituting fe with ni / co to suppress antiferromagnetism ( afm ) and induce superconductivity @xcite . specifically in the bafe@xmath1ni@xmath2as@xmath3 system , upon doping electrons by ni substitution , the n@xmath19el temperature ( @xmath20 ) and orthorhombic lattice distortion temperature ( @xmath21 ) are gradually suppressed and vanish at about @xmath22 0.11 .",
    "superconductivity emerges at @xmath22 0.05 , then reaches the maximum critical temperature ( @xmath13 ) at about 20 k around @xmath22 0.1 , and finally disappears in the overdoped regime at @xmath22 0.25 [ fig .",

    "the doped electrons simply shift the chemical potential , which shrinks the hole pocket at the @xmath23 point and enlarges the electron pocket at the m point , respectively [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] @xcite .",
    "although the real case is more complicated due to additional effects from impurities @xcite , the experimental results qualitatively agree with the rigid - band model @xcite .",
    "moreover , all fermi - surface sheets show warping along the @xmath24 direction , and the hole sheet becomes more three - dimensional ( 3d ) upon electron doping into the overdoped regime @xcite . thus , a more isotropic superconductivity corresponding to the 3d topology of the fermi surfaces is generally expected in the electron - overdoped compounds .",
    "it is noticed that the hole - doped ba@xmath25k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 system shows a clearly increasing anisotropy of @xmath0 in overdoped samples @xcite with a sign change of the superconducting order parameter across different fermi - surface pockets@xcite , where a lifshitz transition occurs changing the fermi - surface topology @xcite .",

    "the inset shows the sharp superconducting transition of the in - plane resistance normalized at 25 k.

    "while our data for optimally doped samples are consistent with earlier results @xcite , showing a nearly isotropic superconductivity with @xmath26 for the zero - temperature limit , we find that the anisotropy has a very asymmetric doping dependence and increases beyond 2 in the overdoped regime . further analysis of @xmath27 suggests that the anisotropy is intimately related to the change of the fermi - surface topology together with impurity scattering from the ni dopants .",

    "the resistivity in the @xmath37 plane ( @xmath38 ) was measured by a standard four - probe method with magnetic fields applied parallel to the @xmath37 plane ( @xmath39 ) and the @xmath40 axis ( @xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "the field - dependent magnetoresistivity @xmath38 was measured at different temperatures using a 65 t non - destructive pulsed magnet driven by a capacitor bank at the dresden high magnetic field laboratory , with a pulse duration of about 180 ms @xcite .",
    "the applied current was 1 ma at a frequency of 30 - 40 khz .",
    "the voltage was recorded by a digital oscilloscope , yokogawa dl750 , with a high sampling rate of 1 ms/ s and a resolution of 16 bit .",
    "after the pulse , the signal processing is performed by use of a lock - in software procedure .",
    "the down - sweep branch of the pulse was used to determine @xmath0 utilizing its long decay time ( about 150 ms ) . in order to determine the field dependence of @xmath0 near @xmath13 more accurately ,",

    "additional data on the @xmath41 and 0.22 compounds were measured in a 16 t - ppms down to 2 k and in pulsed magnetic fields in a he-3 bath cryostat down to 0.6 k. to ensure a low noise during the measurements , all ohmic contacts , made by silver epoxy , had a low resistance of less than 1 @xmath42 .",

    "we first present typical raw magnetotransport data for the underdoped sample bafe@xmath30ni@xmath31as@xmath3 with @xmath47 k and the overdoped sample bafe@xmath48ni@xmath49as@xmath3 with @xmath50 k in pulsed and static magnetic fields , as shown in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "for other dopings , the magnetoresistance data are very similar .",
    "thus , we only show the extracted @xmath0 data in the following .    in fig .",
    "2 , only negligible field - induced broadening of the resistive transitions is observed , in contrast to what has been observed for ndfeaso@xmath51f@xmath52@xcite , smfeaso@xmath53 , and smfeaso@xmath54f@xmath49@xcite , suggesting a very narrow vortex - liquid region in the ba-122 system .",
    "thus , we determine @xmath0 as the onset of the transition , most closely corresponding to the resistive upper critical field @xcite [ see arrow in fig .",
    "the full recovery of the normal - state resistivity allows us to determine @xmath0 quantitatively for both field geometries . apparently , a stronger in - plane field ( @xmath28 ) is needed to suppress superconductivity , consistent with previous results for iron - based superconductors@xcite . by carefully comparing the results in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , one may immediately find that the upper critical field for @xmath39 ( @xmath8 ) is close to the @xmath55 case ( @xmath6 ) in the underdoped , @xmath56 , sample at low temperatures , while a clear difference between @xmath8 and @xmath6 exists for the overdoped , @xmath57 , sample .",

    "the former is associated with screening currents around vortex cores in order to expel the external field and to reduce the condensation energy , while the latter originates from the zeeman effect . for a single - band superconductor in the dirty limit @xcite ,",
    "the orbital limit is given by @xmath59 .",
    "alternatively , the pauli - limiting field for a weakly coupled bcs superconductor in the absence of spin - orbit scattering can be estimated as @xcite @xmath60 t / k . for the typical underdoped sample bafe@xmath30ni@xmath31as@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "2 ) for example : we obtain @xmath61 k / t and @xmath62 k / t , yielding @xmath63 t for @xmath28 , @xmath64 t for @xmath5 , and @xmath65 t. these estimates do not agree with our experimental data . to fully describe our results , one must take into account both orbital pair - breaking and spin - paramagnetic effects .",
    "therefore , we use the full werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) formula that incorporates the spin paramagnetic effect via the maki parameter @xmath43 and the spin - orbit scattering constant @xmath44 to describe the experimental @xmath0 data@xcite : @xmath66^{-1}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 $ ] . as shown by the red solid line in fig .",
    "4 , the best fit can reproduce the experimental @xmath8 of all the five samples very well .",
    "all of the fit parameters we used are listed in table i for all samples . for @xmath69",
    ", we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the maki parameter @xmath43 , defined as @xmath72 , is comparable to the cases of lifeas@xcite , kfe@xmath3as@xmath3@xcite , and ba@xmath73k@xmath74fe@xmath3as@xmath3@xcite , indicating a dominant spin - paramagnetic effect in the upper critical field for @xmath7 . in fig . 4",
    ", one can see that the whh fit(dashed lines ) underestimates the low - temperature data of @xmath9 , even when considering the orbital pair breaking only ( @xmath75 ) , while a similar fit heavily overestimates @xmath58 especially for @xmath22 0.092 and 0.096 .",
    "thus , the single - band model can not fully describe @xmath9 in the underdoped regime .",
    "on the other hand , the quasilinear temperature dependence of @xmath6 , which has been commonly observed in mgb@xmath18 and other iron pnictides @xcite , can be understood by an effective two - band model @xcite , @xmath76[\\ln{t}+u(\\eta h)]+a_1[\\ln{t}+u(h)]+a_2[\\ln{t}+u(\\eta h)]=0.\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , are determined from the bcs coupling tensor @xmath80@xcite . the function @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the di - gamma function .",
    "other parameters are defined by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the flux quantum and @xmath86 is the electron diffusivity for the @xmath87th fermi - surface sheet . here , we assume @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 with dominant intraband coupling . since the line shape mostly depends on the choice of @xmath45 and @xmath46 rather than the coupling constants @xmath80 , we only tune @xmath45 and @xmath46 to fit @xmath9 , where @xmath91 means different intraband scattering on each fermi sheet .",
    "the two - band fits agree very well with the @xmath9 data ( blue solid lines in fig .",
    "we have also tried to fit @xmath58 with a two - band fit , but this does not capture the saturation of @xmath58 due to strong paramagnetic effect .",
    "therefore , we used a single - band whh fit for @xmath58 and two - band fit for @xmath9 separately , as shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table i.    we have as well analyzed the data for the optimally doped and overdoped samples in the same way .",
    "the fit results are shown in figs . 5 and 6 with the parameters given in table i. for the samples at optimum doping ( fig .",
    "5 ) , the single - band whh fit considering the orbital pair breaking only ( @xmath75 ) overestimates @xmath58 heavily as for the underdoped sample , and underestimates the low - temperature data of @xmath9 slightly .",
    "although a two - band model can better describe the data , the two - band effect may be weaker than for the underdoped sample .",
    "interestingly , @xmath27 at low temperatures becomes very isotropic with @xmath26 for @xmath22 0.10 , which is the smallest anisotropy among all measured iron - based superconductors until now @xcite .",
    "of the five overdoped samples extracted from the magnetotransport measurements .",
    "the solid symbols are obtained from pulse - field measurements , and the open symbols are obtained from ppms measurements .",
    "the red solid line shows a whh fit @xmath8 .",
    "the blue solid line is a two - band fit for @xmath6 .",
    "the fit parameters are given in table i. the dashed lines are the whh predictions with @xmath43 = 0 and @xmath44 = 0 both for @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "]    the overdoped samples show opposite behavior compared to the underdoped samples . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , by increasing ni doping from @xmath22 0.12 to @xmath22 0.22 , the anisotropy of @xmath0 at low temperature grows quickly , and the pure orbital whh fits ( dashed lines ) clearly deviate from the @xmath9 data but agree well with the @xmath58 data . especially for the heavily overdoped sample with @xmath22 0.22 ,",
    "the spin - paramagnetic effects are negligible due to the absent saturation of @xmath92 .",
    "however , we still need the two - band model to describe @xmath93 in the overdoped regime .",
    "although the electronic diffusivity @xmath45 slightly varies between 3 and 4 , the diffusivity ratio @xmath84 rapidly grows from 0.27 to 5.5 upon electron doping .",
    "the large increase of the diffusivity ratio @xmath84 suggests enhanced electronic mobility for one of the bands or a significant change of the relative scattering rate for each band upon electron doping . by approaching zero temperature ,",
    "the anisotropy is beyond 2 for @xmath41 and @xmath94 , clearly different from the nearly isotropic superconductivity for the underdoped and optimally doped samples .",
    "by fitting the @xmath95 data in fig . 4 - fig . 6",
    "( solid lines ) , we obtain the upper critical field @xmath96 for the zero - temperature limit with @xmath97 5% accuracy .",
    "we finally summarize the doping dependence of @xmath14 and their anisotropy @xmath98 in fig . 7 for the whole superconducting dome from @xmath99 to @xmath100 . the gradient color in fig . 7 maps the temperature dependence of the anisotropy @xmath17 for all samples , where all of them show an increasing anisotropy upon warming to @xmath13 .",
    "the overall doping - dependent features of @xmath101 and @xmath102 follow the superconducting dome , while their difference quickly increases especially on the overdoped side , resulting in an abrupt increase of @xmath98 when @xmath103 . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "7 , the overall doping dependence of @xmath98 is highly asymmetric with a minimum @xmath104 1.02 at optimal doping @xmath22 0.10 , which should be related to the asymmetric superconducting dome in the bafe@xmath1ni@xmath2as@xmath3 system .",
    "it is argued , that the nearly isotropic @xmath0 for most of the optimally doped iron pnictides may originate either from pauli - limiting or band - warping effects along the @xmath24 direction@xcite . in our results , the pauli - limiting effect ( marked as @xmath43 ) is indeed strongest around optimum doping , then quickly weakens , and finally vanishes in the overdoped samples , resulting in small @xmath101 and @xmath98 for optimally doped compounds , and larger @xmath101 and @xmath98 for the overdoped samples .",
    "however , this simple picture can not explain the difference in @xmath17 between the underdoped ( @xmath105 ) and the overdoped ( @xmath106 ) samples with similar values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( table i ) .",
    "on the other hand , upon doping electrons , the warped cylindrical fermi surface around the @xmath107 line first transforms to a 3d ellipsoid centered at the z point , and completely disappears near the concentration where superconductivity appears , while the electron fermi - surface sheet around the x point continuously increases@xcite .",
    "we also notice that the two - band fits of @xmath9 show a crossover of the diffusivity ratio @xmath84 from @xmath108 to @xmath109 around @xmath110 , corresponding to the disappearance of the hole pocket at the @xmath23 point .",
    "thus , the ni dopants remarkably affect the scattering rate and induce an unbalanced mobility between the electron and hole band and additionally change the topology of the fermi surface .",
    "indeed , recent calculations suggest that the co / ni dopants in 122 compounds increase the impurity potential and introduce stronger scattering on the hole band accompanied by a weak interband scattering@xcite .",
    "therefore , the doping - dependent anisotropy of the superconductivity in bafe@xmath1ni@xmath2as@xmath3 can be understood by the dual effects from the fermi - surface topology and impurity scattering . at first",
    ", the 3d - like hole fermi surface with dominant diffusivity tends to form a nearly isotropic superconductivity in the underdoped compounds@xcite .",
    "then the warping effect of the hole sheets becomes more prominent after doping more electrons , and it tends to form an isotropic superconductivity as well . by further doping ni into the overdoped regime ,",
    "the charge carriers from the tiny hole pocket around the z point are mostly localized and contribute insignificantly to the superconductivity . while the less - warped electron fermi surface with large volume and high mobility gives rise to a deviation from isotropic superconductivity , leading to a highly asymmetric doping dependence of @xmath98 significantly enhanced in the overdoped regime .",
    "thus , the optimum doping with the most isotropic superconductivity , correlates with an isotropic scattering from different fermi surfaces with fine - tuned scattering rate and fermi - surface topology .    , @xmath6 , and @xmath17 at 0 k. the gradient color maps the temperature dependence of the anisotropy @xmath17 ( right axis ) .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the temperature dependence of the upper critical field ( @xmath0 ) in a series of bafe@xmath1ni@xmath2as@xmath3 ( 0.065@xmath1110.22 ) single crystals in magnetic fields up to 60 t aligned both within the @xmath37 plane and along the @xmath40 axis .",
    "all @xmath58 data can be fitted by the whh formula including orbital and spin - paramagnetic effects , while the quasilinear @xmath9 data can be described by an effective two - band model .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath0 at 0 k , @xmath98 , is close to 1 for the underdoped and optimally doped samples , but increases beyond 2 for the overdoped samples , forming a highly asymmetric doping dependence similar to the superconducting dome .",
    "our results indicate that the superconducting anisotropy is determined by the topology of the fermi surfaces together with the doping - induced impurity scattering , and that the multi - band physics is important for the optimal superconductivity in iron pnictides .",
