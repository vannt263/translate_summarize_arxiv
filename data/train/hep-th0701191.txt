    "quantum field theorists face the arduous task of figuring out the large scale implications of models defined by interactions at a small scale . in general , the large distance behavior of the theory can be encoded in an effective action @xmath14 which describes the interactions of the zero - momentum modes of the fields .",
    "knowing @xmath14 , we can answer important questions regarding , for instance , the stability and triviality of the theory .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite was designed to calculate @xmath14 by a sequence of small steps where the high energy modes are integrated progressively .",
    "this procedure generates a sequence of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scale above which we have integrated all the modes . in the process , many new interactions are introduced and with them functions also evolving with @xmath16 .",
    "this can be seen as a flow in the space of theories .",
    "we call this type of flows the rg flows .",
    "important simplifications may occur near fixed points that have only a few unstable directions and universal properties may emerge . despite the conceptual beauty of the construction , the practical calculation of the rg flows remains very difficult .",
    "the behavior near fixed points can usually be handled by some expansion ( weak coupling , strong coupling , etc ... ) , but interpolating between two fixed points is in general a major difficulty .",
    "unfortunately , this is essential to calculate @xmath14 .    in the following ,",
    "we review our present understanding of the interpolation between fixed points for dyson s hierarchical model @xcite , a model for which the calculation of @xmath15 can be reduced to the calculation of the effective potential @xmath17 and can performed numerically with great accuracy .",
    "other type of hierarchical models have been discussed in the literature ( see , for instance , reference @xcite ) , however , in the following , we only consider dyson s model .",
    "the hierarchical model ( hm ) will only refer to dyson s model in this review .",
    "the rg transformation for the hm can be expressed as a simple one - variable integral equation very similar to the so - called approximate recursion formula proposed by wilson @xcite . in many respects ,",
    "the techniques involved in the solution of this model can be compared to those used in elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "the reason for this remarkable simplicity is that the kinetic term of the model is not renormalized . in other words , it is a model for which the local potential approximation ( lpa ) is exact .    in recent years , the lpa has been widely used in the context of exact renormalization group equations ( erge ) and has generated a lot of interest .",
    "we recommend references @xcite for reviews of the recent progress .",
    "erge allow in principle the study of global and nonlinear aspects of the rg flows of field theoretical or statistical models . however , truncation methods are necessary in order to make practical calculations .",
    "one particularly popular choice is to combine polchinski s erge @xcite with the lpa @xcite .",
    "this results in a simple partial differential equation ( called `` polchinski s equation '' below ) for the effective potential .",
    "polchinski s equation can also be obtained @xcite as an infinitesimal version of the rg equation for the hm .",
    "this suggests that the linearized theories should be close to each other .",
    "accurate calculations of the critical exponents @xcite show that the exponents differ only in the fifth significant digit . in reference",
    "@xcite , it was believed that the two exponents should coincide , however this is not the case ( this will be explained in section [ sec : erge ] ) .",
    "originally , the hm was introduced by dyson @xcite as a long - range ferromagnetic ising model with couplings weaker than the one - dimensional ising model with long - range couplings falling off like a power .",
    "the existence of a phase transition and of the infinite volume limit for some range of the parameter controlling the decay of the interactions , can be proved rigorously .",
    "historical motivations and rigorous results are discussed in more detail in section [ sec : motrig ] .",
    "the model was rediscovered a few years later by baker @xcite in an attempt to construct models for which wilson s approximate recursion formula or an integral equation of the same form become the exact rg transformation . in this context",
    ", the hm appears rather like an approximation of a scalar field theory on a @xmath18-dimensional lattice .",
    "later , we call the process of interpolation between the hm and lattice models with nearest neighbor interaction the `` improvement of the hierarchical approximation '' .    one important goal of the review article is to stress the similarities between polchinski equation ( a generic computational tool ) and the hm ( often perceived as a toy model ) .",
    "the motivations for using the hm model are :    * it is a lattice model right from the beginning .",
    "* high - accuracy methods exist to calculate numerically the critical exponents and the rg flows for arbitrary potentials . * conventional expansions ( weak and strong coupling , @xmath19-expansion )",
    "can be implemented easily and large order series can be obtained . *",
    "the hierarchical approximation can in principle be improved @xcite .",
    "the study of critical phenomena has reached a stage where many methods have been refined to a point where they provide numbers very close to each other @xcite . in the case of the hm",
    ", all the approximations can be compared to very accurate numerical answers .",
    "the ability to construct the rg flows very accurately means that we can study general features of these flows far away from fixed points .",
    "this type of study is also possible using the lpa @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the hm is its discrete scale invariance which , depending on the context , can be seen either as an annoyance @xcite or an interesting intrinsic property @xcite .",
    "the review is focused on doing calculations directly in 3 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath19-expansion near 4 dimensions , which is reviewed in reference @xcite , is not discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : block ] , we briefly review the basic concepts of the rg method , the scaling hypothesis and the practical difficulties of blockspinning .",
    "this section motivates approximations that simplify the blockspinning procedure .",
    "dyson s hm is introduced in section [ sec : model ] , with the notation used later in the review .",
    "several equivalent forms of the recursion formula are presented in section [ sec : recursion ] .",
    "more general recursion formulas which coincide with the hm s one for a particular choice of what we call the scale parameter , are introduced in section [ sec : inequivalent ] .",
    "this includes wilson s approximate recursion formula @xcite which is inequivalent to the recursion formula of the hm . in the following",
    ", we denote the scale parameter @xmath2 . in the literature ,",
    "the same parameter is often denoted @xmath20 , but we preferred to keep that symbol for the linear size of the whole system .",
    "having introduced the basic concepts , motivations for the hm , numerical and rigorous results are reviewed in section [ sec : motrig ] .",
    "the numerical treatment of the recursion formula is discussed in section [ sec : num ] and perturbation theory with a large field cutoff in section [ sec : cutpt ] .",
    "the relation to polchinski s erge in the lpa is discussed in section [ sec : erge ] .",
    "we introduce the non - linear scaling variables associated with a fixed point in section [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "these quantities , originally introduced by wegner @xcite , transform multiplicatively under a rg transformation .",
    "they have features similar to the action - angle variables used in classical mechanics .",
    "small - denominator problems are in general present and need to be discussed in each case . in section [ sec : global ] , we describe the non - universal critical amplitudes as rg invariants made out of two non - linear scaling fields . a practical calculation based on this method",
    "requires the ability to use both sets of scaling fields in a common intermediate region , in other words , to interpolate between the fixed points .",
    "the notion of a nontrivial continuum limit , originally introduced by wilson @xcite is reviewed and applied to the hm in section [ sec : nontrivial ] .",
    "calculations of critical amplitudes and their universal ratios are then discussed . in section [ sec : largen ] , we introduce the extension of the hm for @xmath0 components and discuss the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we compare the results with those obtained with polchinski equation emphasizing the difference in the 5th digit already mentioned above , which reflects the non - equivalence of the models .",
    "the possibility of improving the hierarchical approximation by breaking its symmetries in a systematic way is discussed in section [ sec : imp ] .",
    "compared to the improvement of the lpa by the derivative expansion , the improvement of the hierarchical approximation is an underdeveloped subject . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that much progress remains to be done in the erge approach in order to match the accuracy of other methods @xcite for the calculation of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "we hope that this review will facilitate the communication between the two approaches .",
    "reference @xcite is a very recent example of progress made in this direction .",
    "finally , the possibility of including fermions in approximately supersymmetric models is briefly discussed in section [ sec : susy ] .    one motivation to study global and nonlinear aspects of rg flows not covered in this review is to improve our understanding of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "in this theory of strongly interacting quarks and gluons , weakly interacting particles are seen at short distance ( asymptotic freedom ) , while nonperturbative effects cause the confinement of quarks and gluons at large distance .",
    "understanding how these two behaviors can be smoothly connected is a single theory amounts to interpolate between two fixed points of the renormalization group ( rg ) transformation . despite recent progress @xcite",
    "it remains a challenge to understand confinement in terms of weak coupling variables .",
    "this is work for the future .",
    "in this section , we present the basic ideas behind the rg method and point out the practical difficulties associated with the so - called blockspin method .",
    "we are interested in the large distance ( low momentum , long wavelength ) behavior of scalar models .",

    ", @xmath46 plays the role of the helmholtz potential , @xmath47 the role of minus the volume and @xmath23 the role of the pressure .",
    "when we are in the gas phase below the critical temperature ( but above the triple point temperature ) , if we increase the pressure keeping the temperature fixed , the volume decreases until a critical pressure is reached where the gas and the liquid can coexist at an equilibrium pressure but with different specific volumes .",
    "the discontinuity in the magnetization is analog to the specific volume discontinuity .",
    "the sign is justified by the fact that as we increase @xmath23 , the magnetization increases , but if we increase the pressure , the volume decreases .    in the simple case where @xmath46 is an even function with a unique minimum at zero , we can expand @xmath48 using the derivative of this expansion to express @xmath23 in terms of @xmath41 , plugging into equation ( [ eq : gibbs ] ) , using equation ( [ eq : conn ] ) and solving order by order in @xmath41 , we obtain the well - known relations @xmath49 and so on .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath46 is an important objective the rg method .",
    "we now consider a scalar model on a @xmath18-dimensional cubic lattice with a lattice spacing @xmath50 .",
    "the rg transformation proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we integrate the @xmath51 fields in blocks of linear size @xmath52 while keeping the sum of the fields in the block constant .",
    "we then divide the sums of the fields by a factor @xmath53 and treat them as our new field variables .",
    "the exponent @xmath54 is introduced in order to keep the canonical form of the kinetic term and its calculation is non - trivial .",
    "we then obtain a new theory in terms of a new field variable which is equivalent to the previous one as long as we only consider processes involving energies smaller than the new ultraviolet cutoff @xmath55 .",
    "given an original action , we assume that the rg transformation provides a new effective action expressed in terms of the new field variable .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the practical aspects of the partial integration to subsection [ subsec : practical ] .",
    "the information that is kept during the rg transformation is encoded in the average values of all the integer powers of the sum of the fields in the blocks .",
    "we call these average values the `` zero momentum green s functions at finite volume ''",
    ". this set of values can be thought of as an element of an infinite vector space . in the following we call the trajectories in this space",
    "the rg flows .",
    "if we start with an infinite volume lattice , the rg transformation can in principle be repeated an infinite number of times .",
    "if this can be done , the resulting effective theory is limited to the zero - momentum green s functions .",
    "we are particularly interested in finding the fixed points of the rg transformation , since the above limit can be simplified in the neighborhood of a fixed point .",
    "the rg transformation has several obvious fixed points .",
    "if the interactions are limited to quadratic ones and there is no restriction on the range of the fields , the partition function can be calculated exactly using diagonalization and gaussian integration .",
    "the model describes non - interacting particles of a given mass .",
    "we call this mass in cutoff units @xmath56",
    ". it can be determined in cutoff units using the zero - momentum two point function .",
    "after one rg transformation , the mass for the new effective theory is @xmath57 .",
    "the gaussian fixed point ( also called the trivial fixed point ) corresponds to the theory with @xmath58 .",
    "there are usually other fixed points which corresponds to stable phases .",
    "for instance , the high - temperature fixed point which can be thought as an infinitely massive theory where the fluctuations about the zero field value are entirely suppressed .",
    "in addition to these obvious fixed points , we expect non - trivial fixed points when @xmath59 .",
    "these are characterized by one or more unstable direction .",
    "the critical hypersurface is given as the stable manifold ( e.g. the basin of attraction ) of this non - trivial fixed point .",
    "its codimension is the number of unstable directions . in the rest of this section",
    ", we specialize the discussion to the case where there is only one unstable direction .",
    "the stable manifold can then be reached by considering a family of models indexed by a parameter which can be tuned in order to cross the stable manifold . in field theory context",
    ", we usually pick the bare mass to accomplish this purpose . in the statistical mechanics formulation",
    ", the inverse temperature @xmath60 can be tuned to its critical value @xmath61 which is a function of the other interactions . near the non - trivial fixed point",
    ", we can use the eigenvectors of the linearized rg transformation as a basis .",
    "as far as we are close to the fixed point , the average values of the powers of the _ rescaled _ total field stay approximately unchanged after one transformation .",
    "however at each iteration , the components in the eigendirections are multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue . in the following ,",
    "we denote the eigenvalue larger than 1 as @xmath62 . as we assumed that there is only one unstable direction , there is only one such eigenvalue and it is the largest one .    after repeating the renormalization group transformation @xmath10 times ,",
    "we have replaced @xmath63 sites by one site and associated a block variable with it .",
    "we define the finite volume susceptibility @xmath64 as the average value of the square of the sum of all the ( unrescaled ) fields inside the block divided by the number of sites @xmath63 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath64 near the non - trivial fixed point .",
    "the average of the square of the rescaled variables is approximately a constant that we call @xmath65 . to get the susceptibility",
    ", we need to go back to the original variables ( so we multiply @xmath65 by @xmath66 ) and divide by the volume @xmath63 .",
    "we can also take into account the motion along the unstable direction in the linear approximation . in summary , near the fixed point , @xmath67 the constant @xmath68 depends on the way the critical hypersurface is approached when @xmath60 is varied close to @xmath61 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) is valid only if the linearization procedure is applicable , in other words if @xmath69 . on the other hand , when @xmath10 reaches some critical value @xmath70 such that @xmath71 non - linear effects become important and the sign of @xmath72 becomes important . in the following",
    "we consider the case of the symmetric phase ( @xmath73 ) which is simpler .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath74 starts stabilizing when @xmath10 gets of the order of @xmath70 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 when @xmath78 , the trajectories fall into the completely attractive ht fixed point .",
    "the approach of the fixed point is characterized by corrections proportional to negative powers of the volume .",
    "we can also take into account the corrections due to the so - called irrelevant directions which correspond to eigenvalues less than 1 and eigenvectors along the stable manifold .",

    "it should be emphasized that often , the lattice spacing does not appear explicitly but is considered as a function of the bare parameters .",
    "the relation between the two is usually established by relating lengths calculated in lattice spacing to physical lengths .",
    "the continuum limit consist in taking a trajectory in the space of bare parameters which corresponds to the limit of zero lattice spacing .",
    "when @xmath91 , we are in the low temperature phase and @xmath92 .",
    "the sign of @xmath92 is positive ( negative ) if we take the limit @xmath93 by positive ( negative ) values .",
    "additional subtractions are then required as shown in equation ( [ eq : connected ] ) .",
    "the case of the low temperature will be discussed in subsection [ subsec : lt ] for the hm .",
    "relations among exponents can be obtained from the scaling hypothesis @xcite . making explicit",
    "the dependence of the non - analytical part of the gibbs potential , denoted @xmath94 , on the reduced temperature @xmath95 , the scaling hypothesis amounts to have @xmath96=\\scale ^d g_s[t , j]\\ .\\ ] ] the exponents @xmath97 are connected to the critical exponents discussed above by the relations @xmath98 it is also common to introduce exponents which describe the correlations as a function of the inverse distance for the conjugated variables at criticality , namely @xmath99 for the field and for the energy respectively .",
    "the scaling hypothesis will be further discussed in subsections [ subseq : uv ] , [ subsec : critical ] and [ subsec : lt ] .      in the previous subsection , we have assumed that it was possible to integrate over the variables in a block while keeping the sum of the field constant .",
    "this procedure is usually called `` blockspinning '' , an idea which can be traced back to kadanoff @xcite . in practice",
    ", blockspinning is usually quite complicated .",
    "however , for models with actions quadratic in the fields , it is possible to do it analytically . of course",
    ", for such models , all the correlation functions can be calculated exactly , but the procedure can be considered as the first step in a perturbative expansion . to fix the ideas , we can consider a one - dimensional lattice model where the fourier transform of the two point function ( the propagator ) is @xmath100 .",
    "assuming that the lattice sites are labeled by integers , we have the periodicity @xmath101 .",
    "if we now partition the lattice into blocks of even - odd pairs of neighbor sites and blockspin within these blocks , we obtain a new two - point function on a new lattice with a lattice spacing twice larger .",
    "if we denote the fourier transform of the two - point function after @xmath10 steps @xmath102 , the iteration formula is : @xmath103 it is clear that the @xmath104 periodicity is preserved and no sharp edges are introduced at least in a finite number of iterations .",
    "the construction can be extended in arbitrary dimensions and was used as the starting point for the finite - lattice approximation @xcite .    in order to get an idea of the difficulty to extend the procedure when higher order interactions are introduced , it is instructive to consider the simple case of a 4-sites ring with nearest - neighbor quadratic interactions and local quartic interactions . @xmath105 with nearest neighbor quadratic terms @xmath106 and @xmath107 and local quartic interactions @xmath108 for further convenience , we also define the next to nearest neighbor quadratic interactions",
    "@xmath109    we now try to blockspin .",
    "we pick ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) as our basic blocks and then combine them into the block containing all the sites . more specifically",
    ", it consists in introducing 1 in the integral in the following form : @xmath110 if we can perform the integration over @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and then over @xmath113 , we will be able to write @xmath114 in this illustrative model , @xmath115 is the main quantity of interest . because of the quadratic terms @xmath116 , we can not perform the integral over @xmath111 independently of the integral over @xmath112 and blockspinning is potentially more difficult than evaluating the integral without intermediate steps .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the terms of @xmath116 connect the fields across the blocks and are not invariant under independent interchanges @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "these two transformations are of order 2 and commute , they generate a group of order 4 .",
    "if we average @xmath116 over the 4 elements @xmath119 of this group , we obtain @xmath120 if we replace @xmath116 by this average , we have twice more terms but with half of the strength .",
    "also , the new terms have a longer range . at first sight , it is not clear that the situation is better than before . however , if we combine this average with one half of the harmless @xmath121 , which is invariant under the above mentioned symmetry group , we obtain @xmath122 the first term affects only the local measure and the second can be incorporated directly into @xmath115 .",
    "this simple example illustrates how a symmetry can be used as a guide to build a ( modified ) model where blockspinning is feasible .",
    "dyson s hierarchical model is a model where a hierarchical exchange symmetry among the sites is built - in and allows to blockspin the partition function by performing a sequence of one - dimensional integrals .",
    "in this subsection , we describe dyson s hierarchical model with the notations used in most of the rest of this review . the relationship between this formulation and other ones found in the literature",
    "is discussed in sections [ sec : recursion ] and [ sec : inequivalent ] .",
    "the model requires @xmath123 sites .",
    "we label the sites with @xmath124 indices @xmath125 , each index being 0 or 1 .",
    "we divide the @xmath123 sites into two blocks , each containing @xmath126 sites . if @xmath127 , the site is in the first block , if @xmath128 , the site is in the second block . repeating this procedure @xmath10 times ( for the two blocks , their respective two sub - blocks , etc . ) , we obtain an unambiguous labeling for each of the sites . the indices on the left provide the coarser division while the indices on the right provide a finer division . with an appropriate choice of origin",

    "the constant @xmath130 is a free parameter assumed positive and which controls the decay of the iterations with the size of the blocks and can be adjusted in order to mimic a @xmath18-dimensional model .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail below ( see equation([eq : cdim ] ) ) .",
    "the field @xmath131 is integrated over a local measure which we need to specify . in the following",
    ", we will often work with the ising measure , @xmath132 or a landau - ginsburg measure of the form @xmath133 .    in the case of the ising measure ,",
    "the only free parameter is @xmath130 .",
    "if all the @xmath134 , then the cost in energy for flipping one spin is @xmath135 and is finite in the infinite volume limit only if @xmath136 . in the following",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath137 .",
    "the hierarchical structure of equation ( [ eq : ham ] ) , allows us to integrate iteratively the fields while keeping their sums in blocks with 2 sites constant .",
    "@xmath138 where @xmath139 is understood as the sum of the two fields in the block .",
    "after @xmath124 integrations , we obtain @xmath140 with @xmath141 remarkably , the symmetries of the model have allowed us to calculate the partition function and the effective potential by calculating only @xmath124 independent integrals instead of the @xmath123 coupled integrals that one would naively expect .",
    "the symmetry group of the hm is of order @xmath142 , which is one half of the number of configurations for a ising measure .",
    "this can be seen as follows . in any of the blocks of size 2 we can interchange two sites .",
    "the exchange can be done independently in each of the blocks and this symmetry can be seen as _",
    "local_. there are @xmath143 blocks of size 2 and so @xmath144 distinct symmetry transformations .",
    "similarly , we can interchange the blocks of size 2 inside any block of size 4 which generates @xmath145 independent transformations .",
    "we can similarly generate independent symmetries until we reach the group of order 2 exchanging two blocks of size @xmath146 .",
    "using @xmath147 we obtain the announced result .",
    "as explained in subsection [ subsec : basic ] , the rg transformation consists in a blockspinning and a rescaling . in the present example , the rescaling is fixed by the requirement of keeping @xmath148 unchanged in the infinite volume limit . more specifically ,",
    "if we define @xmath149 with @xmath150 we can rewrite the energy as @xmath151 with @xmath152 in other words , we can blockspin without thinking about @xmath148 and then include the second term of equation ( [ eq : hamprime ] ) in the local measures .",
    "the problem is then identical to the original problem except for the fact that we have to reduce @xmath124 by 1 and to use a new local measure .",
    "the change in the local measure can be expressed through the recursion relation @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a normalization factor which can be fixed at our convenience .",

    "following the same reasoning , we can determine the parameters introduced in subsection [ subsec : basic ] .",
    "since we integrate over two sites in one rg transformation we have @xmath191 on the other hand , comparing the field rescaling , we obtain @xmath192 which is consistent with equation ( [ eq : cdim ] ) only if @xmath193    in summary , we have @xmath194 we can reinterpret equation ( [ eq : gscaling ] ) by noticing that it implies that at each rg transformation , @xmath195 is rescaled by a factor @xmath196 .",

    "what is remarkable about this redefinition is that we have replaced @xmath218 in equation ( [ eq : wresc ] ) by @xmath219 . any other multiplicative redefinition ,",
    "would in general lead to some hybrid form where the weight depends on @xmath168 and @xmath220 .",

    "if we define @xmath221 the recursion formula becomes @xmath222 the recursion used by baker in reference @xcite is obtained by setting @xmath223}(\\phi)=\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}q_n(\\phi))\\ ] ]    note that baker allowed a non - zero @xmath54 in order to mimic the scaling near the non - trivial fixed point instead of the scaling near the gaussian fixed point for a conventional lattice model .",
    "it is possible to take into account this modification by changing the value of @xmath18 used in equation ( [ eq : cdim ] ) .",

    "the group is the multiplicative group of the 2-adic units and its representations are known @xcite .",
    "completeness can be used to expand the kinetic term , i.e. , the function @xmath369 , for each of the shells .",
    "this solves the bookkeeping problem .",
    "nicely enough , the classification of the representations of the group mentioned above comes with an index indicating its resolution power ( called the degree of ramification ) .",
    "this naturally provides the successive orders of our perturbative expansion .",
    "we then show that if we only retain the trivial representation in the expansion , we obtain the hierarchical approximation .",
    "in this limit , the group of transformation is a symmetry of the action which can be identified with the symmetry group of the hm mentioned above .",
    "we can relabel the momenta @xmath170 .",
    "for this purpose , we use a set orthonormal functions which is a discrete version of the walsh system @xcite .",
    "we first define @xmath370 and    @xmath371    with the notation @xmath372 .    for a given integer @xmath373 with @xmath374",
    "we define @xmath375 it is clear that @xmath376 and we can check that @xmath377 a more detailed analysis shows that @xmath378 is non - zero only when @xmath379 $ ] for a function @xmath380 $ ] which will be specified .",

    "we can now expand @xmath382 we can then rewrite @xmath383 where @xmath384)$ ] . by construction ,",
    "the @xmath385 are real field variables . for convenience",
    "we shall also use their complex form @xmath386    we can now explain the correspondence between this relabeling and wilson s cell decomposition . clearly , if @xmath387 , @xmath378 is supported in the high momentum region . more precisely , the 0-th shell , i.e , the one integrated first in the rg procedure , consists in configurations which can be expanded in terms of the @xmath388 .",
    "similarly , the modes corresponding tho the @xmath323-th shell are made out of the the @xmath389 .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have introduced new field variables @xmath385 corresponding to the @xmath323-th shell when @xmath50 can be divided by @xmath390 but not by @xmath391 .",
    "this property is not affected if @xmath50 is multiplied ( modulo @xmath7 ) by any odd number .",
    "as explained in subsection [ subsec : ultram ] , odd numbers form an abelian group with respect to the multiplication modulo @xmath7 .",
    "the orbit of this group within the integers modulo @xmath7 are precisely the sets of numbers that we have put in correspondence with the shells .",
    "the representations of this group have been studied and classified @xcite . in order to use this classification",
    ", we have to embed the labels introduced above and denoted @xmath50 , in the @xmath392-adic integers .",
    "when @xmath50 can be divided by @xmath390 but not by @xmath391 , we say that the 2-adic norm , noted @xmath393 , is @xmath394 . in the infinite volume limit , or in other words when @xmath10 tends to infinity , the multiplicative group of the odd numbers is the 2-adic units . the representations of this group will be denoted @xmath395 .",
    "this means that if @xmath396 and @xmath397 are 2-adic units , then @xmath398 .",
    "the label @xmath84 specifies the representation in a way which will be explained below .",
    "it is easy to construct explicitly the representations @xmath395 .",
    "a 2-adic unit can be written @xcite as @xmath399 where @xmath310 is a ( 2-adic ) integer and @xmath400 the 2-adic exponential .",
    "@xmath401 is even or odd under multiplication by @xmath402 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath310 is an additive parametrization and the @xmath310 dependence of @xmath395 will be of the form @xmath403 where @xmath301 is an odd integer and @xmath345 a positive integer .",
    "taibleson @xcite calls @xmath404 the degree of ramification . in summary , the label @xmath84 is a short notation for the parity , @xmath345 and @xmath301 an odd integer modulo @xmath405 .",
    "we can now use these representations to expand the the kinetic term function @xmath406 in each shell . for",
    "a given shell @xmath323 , the @xmath50 have the form @xmath407 ( so @xmath408 ) and we can write ,    @xmath409    at finite volume , i.e. , at finite @xmath10 , the units are understood modulo @xmath410 and consequently the sum over the representations @xmath84 is restricted to @xmath411 .",
    "the numerical coefficients @xmath412 are easily calculable using the orthogonality relations among the representation .",
    "the hierarchical approximation is obtained by retaining only the trivial representation in the expansion equation ( [ eq : sumrep ] ) . in this approximation , and using the definition introduced in equation ( [ eq : defsig ] ) , the action reads @xmath413 after a fourier transform , we obtain a hierarchical model having the general form ( with arbitrary @xmath414 couplings at level @xmath323 ) ( see section [ sec : motrig ] ) .",
    "the classification of the representations of the 2-adic units suggest that we improve the hierarchical approximation by taking into account the additional terms in the equation ( [ eq : sumrep ] ) @xmath415 .",
    "intuitively , this corresponds to the fact that the degree of ramification measures the `` power of resolution '' of the representation .",
    "numerically , this works reasonably well : in a simple example , the coefficients become smaller as the degree increases @xcite .    the actions written above",
    "take a more familiar form after fourier transformation in @xmath50 .",
    "in general , the @xmath323-th momentum shell is responsible for interactions among the averages of the fourier transformed fields inside boxes of size @xmath390 . in the hierarchical approximation ,",
    "the interactions depend only on the position of these boxes inside boxes of size @xmath391 . when the corrections are introduced up to @xmath416 , the interactions depend on the position inside boxes of size @xmath417 .",
    "it is important to realize that in the hierarchical approximation , @xmath21 is invariant under the transformation @xmath418 for any odd number @xmath247 .",
    "when the other terms of the expansion are incorporated , this symmetry is broken by each term in a definite way .",
    "this allows us to use ward identities techniques .",
    "we discuss the simplest case below .",
    "suppose we want to calculate the 2-point function , using the perturbative expansion described in the previous section .",
    "first we use the new variables @xmath385 and the inverse of the map @xmath380 $ ] defined in section 2 to write @xmath419 } > \\ .\\ ] ]    in the hierarchical approximation , the value of this expression depends only on the momentum shell specified by @xmath393 . in other words , @xmath420 where @xmath421 means that the quantity is evaluated , at order zero , or in other words , in the hierarchical approximation .",
    "suppose that we now include a correction @xmath422 to the approximation of @xmath423 .",
    "then in first order in this perturbation , we recover the a momentum dependence within the shells given by @xmath424 in the model considered here , the @xmath425 contribution can be evaluated straightforwardly and we can check that we recover the first term in the expansion of @xmath426 .",
    "the important point is that the corrections are evaluated using the unperturbed action .",
    "it is clear that similar methods can be used for higher point functions and in the interacting case .",
    "an extension to @xmath18-dimension can be constructed easily by noticing the approximate correspondence between the integration over successive shells and the block - spin method . on a @xmath18-dimensional cubic lattice",
    ", we can decompose the block - spin procedure into @xmath18 steps ( one in each directions ) .",
    "the 2-adic formulation of the hm can be used for other purposes .",
    "for instance , it is possible to understand the absence of certain diagrams in the approximate recursion formula @xcite .",
    "the lack of diagrams with three lines having large momenta coming out of a vertex can be understood from the fact that the sum of two 2-adic integers with 2-adic norm 1 is a 2-adic integer with a strictly lower norm . in simpler words , the sum of two odd number is even .",
    "2-adic analysis was also used to study the symanzik representation of the hm @xcite . the basic ingredient",
    "@xcite being that the quadratic form in @xmath148 defines a random walk with a hausdorff dimension @xmath427 .",
    "in subsections [ subsec : hier ] and [ subsec : infinite ] , we made clear that the continuum limit requires a fine - tuning and that this procedure maybe be seen as unnatural .",
    "this feature is clearly related to the existence of an unstable direction . in four dimensions ,",
    "there are several ways to get rid of the unstable directions and limit the flow to marginal directions .",
    "one possibility is to impose a gauge symmetry that forbids a mass term for the gauge fields .",
    "another possibility is to introduce new degrees of freedom with opposite statistics that partially cancel the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this possibility has been exploited in the perturbative treatment of supersymmetric models . in the following , we follow this second idea and construct models with approximate supersymmetry .",
    "other hierarchical models involving fermions can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider a free action for @xmath0 massless scalar fields @xmath428 and fermion fields @xmath429 and @xmath430 : @xmath431 where @xmath324 and @xmath325 run over the sites and @xmath432 from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath429 and @xmath430 are grassmann numbers integrated with a measure @xmath433 we require that @xmath434 has positive eigenvalues and that we can write @xmath435    the free action @xmath436 is invariant at first order under the transformation @xmath437 the @xmath19 and @xmath438 are grassmann numbers .",
    "integration by part or leibnitz s rule can not be used for @xmath439 and the order @xmath440 variations do not cancel .",
    "we now give the explicit form for the bosonic part at finite volume .",
    "@xmath441 with @xmath442 .",
    "the fermionic part reads : @xmath443 with @xmath444 .",
    "we have the simple relation @xmath445 . using the techniques explained in @xcite ,",
    "one can show that the fermionic operator is the square root of the bosonic operator ( see equation ( [ eq : sq ] ) ) provided that @xmath446    we can introduce local interactions .",
    "the grassmann nature of the fermionic fields restricts severely the type of interactions allowed .",
    "for instance , for one flavor ( @xmath257 ) , the most general bosonic local measure is @xmath447 for convenience , we can reabsorb the local quadratic terms , in the local measure . in the following , @xmath448 will take the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) form : @xmath449 if the two functions @xmath156 and @xmath27 are proportional , the fermionic degrees of freedom decouple .",
    "the renormalization group transformation takes the form @xmath450 where the @xmath451 operation is defined as @xmath452 the introduction of a yukawa coupling can be achieved by having @xmath453 linear .",
    "such a term breaks explicitly the @xmath454 symmetry of the lg measure .",
    "models with two flavors ( @xmath455 ) with the type of bilinear coupling appearing in the wess - zumino@xcite model can be written as @xmath456 this is not the most general measure , however it closes under the renormalization group transformation which takes the form @xmath457 in addition , if we impose that the function @xmath204 has the following form : @xmath458 while @xmath156 , @xmath27 and @xmath459 are @xmath460-invariant , the model is then invariant under the r - symmetry @xmath461    we summarize three numerical calculations @xcite performed for the second model with @xmath462 . first , the case where the fermions decouple from the bosons was considered .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that the calculation of the effective potential at the nontrivial fixed point ( equation ( [ eq : vcrit ] ) ) and for a massive theory in the symmetric phase ( equation ( [ eq : veffm ] ) can be performed numerically with great accuracy .",
    "the second calculation requires the ability to follow the rg flows all the way from the nontrivial point to the ht attractive fixed point . for the hm ,",
    "this can be accomplished numerically or by constructing the nonlinear scaling variables .",
    "the situation could be compared to a quantum mechanical problem which can be solved accurately and consistently by different methods but for which there is no closed form solution .",

    "it should be reminded that before approximations are made , erge can be formulated several equivalent ways .",

    "understanding how asymptotic freedom and confinement can be smoothly connected in a single theory amounts to constructing the renormalization group ( rg ) flows of the theory far away from the two fixed points of interest . in this example",
    "it is expected that nothing dramatic takes place as we interpolate between the two regimes , however , understanding confinement in terms of the weak coupling variables remains a challenge .",
    "proving the existence of a mass gap in yang - mills theories remains one of the clay millennium prize problems .",
