    "measurements of strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions were originally conceived to be the smoking gun of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite . it was argued that due to a drop in the strange quark s dynamical mass and increased production cross section , strangeness in the qgp would saturate on small time scales relative to a hadronic gas .",
    "such an abundance of strangeness quarks may lead to the bulk strange hadrons being enhanced in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p , and allow for production mechanisms such as coalescence or jet flavor conversions to contribute to strange hadron yields in heavy - ion collisions at mid and high-@xmath9 respectively .    in these proceedings , we show new results of mid - rapidity @xmath1 for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 particles in cu+cu @xmath6 gev collisions and compare to @xmath1 values in au+au @xmath6 gev collisions .",
    "these yields are expected to be dominated by soft processes .",
    "we then move to new mid-@xmath7 measurements of the @xmath8 ratios in cu+cu @xmath6 gev collisions where soft and hard processes may compete .",
    "finally , we take advantage of new high-@xmath7 measurements of identified particle production in p+p @xmath12 gev @xcite , and compare strange and non - strange au+au @xmath12 gev @xmath14 as a function of system size for @xmath15 gev / c where hard processes are expected to dominate .",
    "the _ enhancement factor _ for a strange hadron is defined as the yield per participant , @xmath16 , in heavy - ion collisions , divided by the respective value in p+p collisions at the same center of mass energy per nucleon .",
    "it contrasts strangeness production per unit of available energy ( @xmath16 ) in heavy - ion collisions with p+p collisions .",
    "when the enhancement factor is observed to be above one , this indicates the dynamical processes in heavy - ion collisions are much better at liberating the available energy for strangeness production compared to p+p collisions .",
    "indeed , the enhancement factors for strange hadrons have been shown to be significantly above one for pb+pb @xmath17 gev , cu+cu @xmath12 gev , and au+au @xmath12 gev collisions with a hierarchy with respect to the strangeness content @xcite . whether this is due to qgp formation as per the introduction , or phase space suppression in smaller systems @xcite , is an on going debate @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure [ fig1 ] , we show @xmath1 per @xmath16@xmath18 for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 particles in cu+cu and au+au @xmath6 gev collisions .",
    "we are unable to calculate an enhancement factor due to the lack of a p+p reference .",
    "becattini and manninen have recently proposed @xmath1 per @xmath16(therefore the enhancement factor ) may be proportional to the fraction of participants that undergo multiple collisions , @xmath19 , in a core - corona description of strangeness production for au+au @xmath12 gev collisions @xcite .",
    "hadron production from the core gives strangeness yields expected in the qgp saturation scenario , while corona production is p+p like .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig1 ] are from the following relation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants for particle @xmath23 chosen to describe the data .",
    "those constants are independent of system for a given particle .",
    "@xmath24 is obtained from monte carlo glauber calculations and is typically higher in cu+cu compared to au+au at a given @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that the above relation provides a reasonable description of @xmath1 per @xmath16@xmath18 in cu+cu and au+au @xmath6 gev collisions .",
    "however , it was also shown that the above relation is not unique to the core - corona scheme , as it is expected for string excitation / breaking hadron production models @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the @xmath8 ratios as a function of @xmath9 for cu+cu and au+au @xmath6 gev collisions .",
    "large values at mid-@xmath9 in central au+au @xmath12 gev collisions maybe attributed to quark coalescence boosting baryon production relation to meson production @xcite . at the lower energy",
    ", we observe central values at mid-@xmath9 being roughly a factor of 2 higher than peripheral values .    to widen current theoretical comparisons , we show predictions from the epos model which also describes particle production in the core - corona scheme @xcite .",
    "after formation , the core is given a blast - wave velocity profile which boosts the @xmath9 of heavier particles relative to the lighter particles upon hadronization .",
    "corona production is again p+p like , and the relative core contribution to particle production increases with centrality .",
    "we can see epos gives a qualitative description of the data .",
    "this was also shown for the @xmath8 ratios in cu+cu and au+au @xmath12 gev collisions .",
    "in particular , it predicts the mid-@xmath9 @xmath8 ratio should be approximately the same in central cu+cu and au+au collisions despite the large difference in @xmath16(@xmath25 vs. @xmath26 respectively ) .",
    "finally , it was shown epos described the @xmath27 ratios @xcite well in cu+cu and au+au collisions with @xmath12 gev .    in figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "we show the integrated @xmath11 and @xmath13 in au+au @xmath12 gev collisions for particles with @xmath28 gev / c .",
    "it this therefore defined as :    @xmath29    the mean @xmath9 of particles in this range is @xmath10 gev / c .",
    "it has recently been proposed that hard scattered partons may change flavor in the medium altering jet chemistry compared to p+p collisions @xcite .",
    "the abundance of strange quarks created in heavy - ion collisions allow for the leading parton to be replaced a strange quark via elastic interactions , and such a mechanism is predicted to boost @xmath11 for particles with @xmath30 gev / c in central au+au @xmath12 gev collisions by a factor 2 relative to @xmath13 .",
    "we indeed observe such an increase in figure [ fig3 ] , however we also note that @xmath31 in peripheral collisions .",
    "this raises the question whether parton flavor conversions are prevalent in the smaller systems , or whether there is some other soft a+a production mechanism contributing in this @xmath7 range for all centralities .",
    "measurements at higher @xmath9 from future higher statistics rhic a+a runs may help in addressing these questions .",
    "we have presented new results for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 particles in cu+cu @xmath6 gev collisions , and shown in conjunction with au+au 62 @xmath6 gev data , the centrality dependance of @xmath1 per @xmath16@xmath18 has similar trends to a parameterisation based on the fraction of participants that undergo multiple collisions .",
    "we also have shown the @xmath9 dependance of the @xmath8 ratio can be qualitatively described by the epos model in cu+cu and au+au collisions with @xmath32 and 200 gev .",
    "both observations provide evidence for core - corona effects .",
    "finally , we have shown at @xmath28 gev / c @xmath31 for all centralities in au+au @xmath12 gev collisions .",
    "this may provide evidence for parton flavor conversions in heavy - ion collisions .",
