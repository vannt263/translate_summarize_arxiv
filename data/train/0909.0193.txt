    "theoretical approaches to heavy quarkonia radiative decays were developed shortly after the discovery of charmonium  @xcite .",
    "predictions for the direct photon energy spectrum of quarkonia were originally based on decays of orthopositronium into three photons , leading to the expectation that the direct photon momentum spectrum should rise linearly with @xmath9 to the kinematic limit ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "phase space considerations lead to a slight enhancement exactly at the kinematic limit  @xcite .",
    "garcia and soto ( gs )  @xcite have performed the most recent calculation of the expected direct photon spectrum in charmonium decays , using an approach similar to that applied by the same authors for the case of @xmath11(1s)@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "they model the endpoint region by combining non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) with soft collinear - effective theory ( scet ) , which facilitates calculation of the spectrum of the collinear gluons resulting as @xmath10 . at lower momenta ( defined as @xmath130.4 ) ,",
    "the so - called ` fragmentation ' photon component , due to photon radiation off final - state quarks , must be directly calculated . in general ( unfortunately ) , the intermediate @xmath4 regime over which calculations are considered reliable for the @xmath14(2s ) overlaps poorly with the higher @xmath4 kinematic regime to which we have the best experimental sensitivity .",
    "since the quantum numbers of the gluon system allow both color - octet and color - singlet contributions , these must both be explicitly calculated and summed .",
    "of particular relevance to this analysis is the possibility that , in the context of the gs calculation , the contribution due to the octet matrix element can result in a suppression of the ratio of direct - photon to three - gluon widths ( `` @xmath5 '' ) for the @xmath14(2s ) compared to the @xmath6 . since the nrqcd matrix element appears in the denominator of @xmath5 and not in the numerator ( up to order @xmath15 in quark momentum ) , a larger value of this matrix element leads to a reduced value of @xmath5 .    for direct",
    "radiative decays , given a particular photon energy , theory prescribes the angular distribution @xmath16 for the decay of a vector into three massless vectors ( with @xmath17 defined as the polar angle relative to the @xmath18 beam axis ) .",
    "kller and walsh considered the angular spectrum in detail  @xcite , demonstrating that , if the parent is polarized along the beam axis , as the momentum of the most energetic primary ( photon or gluon ) in @xmath19 or @xmath20 approaches the beam energy , the event axis increasingly tends to align with the beam axis .",
    "they parametrized the angular distribution as @xmath21 ; as @xmath221 , @xmath231 .",
    "we note that , according to the kller - walsh prescription , the value of @xmath24 for intermediate @xmath4 values , where most of the events occur , is relatively small ( @xmath250.2 ) . only for @xmath26",
    "is the forward peaking of the photon angular distribution noticeable .",
    "although inclusive radiative decays of radially excited bottomonia have been experimentally investigated  @xcite , there have been no corresponding measurements for the case of charmonium . that one previous measurement of the direct photon spectrum in excited bottomonia ( @xmath11(2s ) and @xmath11(3s ) ) found good agreement in both shape and normalization with the comparable spectrum measured for the @xmath11(1s ) ground state .",
    "the cleo - c detector is essentially identical to the previous cleo  iii detector , with the exception of a modified innermost charged particle tracking system .",
    "elements of the detector , as well as performance characteristics , are described in detail elsewhere @xcite . over the kinematic regime of interest to this analysis , the electromagnetic shower energy resolution is approximately 2% .",
    "the tracking system , rich particle identification system , and electromagnetic calorimeter are all contained within a 1 tesla superconducting solenoid .    the primary data used in this analysis consist of 27.4 m events collected on the @xmath14(2s ) resonance at a center - of - mass energy @xmath27=3686 mev , over three distinct running periods . to reduce uncertainties from event - finding efficiencies , we require a minimum of one charged track found in the event . except for this charged multiplicity requirement ,",
    "all event selection criteria , photon definitions , and the generation of background estimators are identical to those detailed in our previous analyses of @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite data .",
    "we therefore present only an abbreviated discussion below .",
    "events containing two tracks loosely consistent with leptons and identified topologically as ( radiative ) bhabha or ( radiative ) muon pair events are explicitly rejected from consideration as candidate radiative decays , as are events consistent with `` 1 vs.  3 '' @xmath28-pair production .",
    "we additionally reject events which have a single , well - identified electron or muon charged track .",
    "photons are defined as showers detected in the barrel ( @xmath290.8 ) electromagnetic calorimeter with energy deposition characteristics consistent with those expected for true photons , and which are well - isolated from both charged tracks as well as other showers .",
    "to obtain @xmath30 , we must determine separately the number of direct photon events and the number of three gluon events . since approximately 4/5 of all @xmath14(2s ) decays are either hadronic or radiative transitions to lower - mass charmonium states , the relative signal to background ( primarily due to @xmath31 and @xmath32 )",
    "is therefore expected to be considerably reduced compared to the corresponding @xmath6 analysis .",
    "moreover , there is a large direct photon background from the @xmath6 itself , which is determined from data and directly subtracted .",
    "note that , for the @xmath14(2s ) , there is also a high - energy enhancement due to radiative continuum processes , such as @xmath33 , which were not present in the tagged @xmath6 analysis .",
    "continuum contributions were circumvented in the previous @xmath34 analysis  @xcite using the ` tagged ' process @xmath14(2s)@xmath35 ; @xmath36x . this continuum contribution ( including initial state radiation [ `` co isr '' ] ) to the observed inclusive photon energy spectrum at @xmath27=3686 mev",
    "is directly determined using data taken at center - of - mass energies 15 mev below the @xmath14(2s ) resonance mass .",
    "there is also a correction due to the radiative return to the @xmath6 , which subsequently decays into @xmath37 , and is implicitly included in our continuum subtraction .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are used as a guide to the expected composition of the raw , observed @xmath27=3686 mev photon momentum spectrum . the mc prediction for the background to the direct photon candidate spectrum , broken down by parent type and source ,",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : psiprnewmcbkgnds ] .",
    "the primary background arises from the cascade process , @xmath14(2s)@xmath38x ; @xmath39 .",
    "this component can be extracted from the data , simply by measuring the inclusive photon spectrum observed in conjunction with two transition charged pions having a recoil mass consistent with that of the @xmath6 .",
    "we scale this observed spectrum up to the total number of @xmath14(2s)@xmath38x events by the ratio @xmath40(2s)@xmath38x)/(@xmath40(2s)@xmath41 ) , with @xmath40(2s)@xmath38x)/@xmath40(2s)@xmath42  @xcite , and @xmath43 defined as the reconstruction efficiency for two transition pions , estimated from mc simulations to be 0.63@xmath440.02 . in principle , this cascade photon spectrum depends on the q - value of the specific @xmath14(2s)@xmath38x transition process ; in practice , the smearing of the photon spectrum due to this variation is negligibly small .",
    "after subtracting the cascade contribution , the dominant non - direct photon background arises primarily from @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays . to model the production of @xmath45 and @xmath46 daughter photons ,",
    "two different estimates were employed in this analysis as well , which we now enumerate . the variation between the results obtained with these estimators",
    "will later be included in our tabulation of systematic errors .",
    "first , as in our previous @xmath6 analysis  @xcite , we take advantage of the expected similar kinematic distributions between charged and neutral pions , as dictated by isospin symmetry .",
    "although isospin will break down both when there are decay processes which are not isospin - symmetric ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) or when the available fragmentation phase space is comparable to @xmath48 , in the intermediate - energy regime ( e.g. , recoil masses of order 2 gev ) , we expect isospin to be reliable",
    ". for pions produced in strong interactions , there should therefore be half as many neutral pions as charged pions .",
    "we observe agreement with this expectation to within @xmath4910% over most of the kinematic regime relevant for this analysis .",
    "a `` pseudo - photon '' background spectrum is generated as follows .",
    "each charged track passing quality requirements and having particle identification information consistent with pions is decayed isotropically in its rest frame into two daughter photons , which are then boosted into the lab . the photon - finding efficiency from monte carlo simulations is then used to determine the fraction of the generated pseudo - photons which contribute to the observed neutral spectrum . using this procedure ,",
    "we not only simulate backgrounds from @xmath50 decays , but also compensate for @xmath51 , by selecting the appropriate parent mass with a frequency prescribed by mc simulations .",
    "in addition to the agreement observed between the `` true '' and `` pseudo - photon '' reconstructed @xmath45 yields , as detailed in the @xmath6 analysis  @xcite , our large @xmath14(3770 ) sample affords an additional check of our pseudo - photon approach . since the @xmath52 mode is kinematically allowed for the @xmath14(3770 ) , the direct photon partial width for that resonance should be immeasurably small .",
    "we have therefore compared the inclusive photon spectra from the @xmath14(3770 ) with our estimated pseudo - photon background to determine how accurately the latter saturates the former .",
    "figure  [ fig:3s2gamx.eps](a ) shows this direct comparison ; figure  [ fig:3s2gamx.eps](b ) shows the residuals after subtracting both continuum initial state radiation , and the estimated pseudo - photon background ( scaled by an empirical factor of 1.03 needed to achieve saturation for @xmath53 ) from the inclusive @xmath14(3770 ) spectrum .",
    "note the conspicuous presence of the photon line at @xmath540.32 in the lower , background - subtracted spectrum , which results from the radiative return to the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "( since our continuum data are taken at a center - of - mass energy approximately 100 mev below the @xmath14(3770 ) resonance , the radiative return peak in the continuum data will not appear at @xmath540.32 as it does for the @xmath14(3770 ) data . )    ( 3770 ) data and pseudo - photon background estimate .",

    "the prominent peak at @xmath55 corresponds to radiative return to @xmath6.,width=302 ]    aside from that feature , the residuals in the background - subtracted spectrum are generally featureless . to set the scale , the efficiency - corrected @xmath560.4 yield after subtraction ( @xmath4926k photons ) deviates from zero by 1.3% relative to the initial candidate photon count in the same kinematic interval ( @xmath492.1 m photons ) prior to subtraction .",
    "we will later use this 1.03 scale factor as a basis for estimating the uncertainty in the background normalization for the @xmath14(2s)@xmath12 analysis .      as with the @xmath57 analysis  @xcite",
    ", we also fit the inclusive photon spectrum to a smooth exponential curve , in the ` control ' interval @xmath58 and extrapolate that curve into the higher - photon energy region as a background estimator . to the extent that the control region contains signal , the exponential may result in an over - subtraction after extrapolation into the high-@xmath4 regime , and therefore , ultimately , an under - estimate of @xmath5 . to assess this bias ,",
    "we have applied the exponential subtraction technique to monte carlo simulations ; we find that the oversubtraction is approximately 9% for @xmath560.4 . by comparison ,",
    "the pseudo - photon subtraction , applied to monte carlo simulations , results in an oversubtraction of less than 5% .",
    "we will later consider these deviations as implicit in our background systematic uncertainty estimate .",
    "in the barrel region , our photon identification algorithms are approximately 86% efficient , with inefficiencies incurred by imposition of a photon isolation requirement and a shower shape requirement .",
    "however , the net photon - finding efficiency is reduced by trigger- and event - finding requirements , as well as the limited fiducial acceptance of the barrel calorimeter .      based on mc simuations , the trigger efficiency for events containing a high - energy photon and at least one charged track",
    "is estimated to be 99.3% . in general",
    ", the pattern of satisfied trigger criteria for mc simulations shows adequate agreement with data .",
    "the largest event - selection inefficiencies are incurred by the requirements that the event pass the lepton veto , and that the event contain at least one well - measured charged track .",
    "figure  [ fig : psi2sevtcuts.eps ] presents our `` smoothed '' net direct photon reconstruction efficiency , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "loss of efficiency at low @xmath4 is attributed to higher multiplicity events having higher likelihood of one track being mistakenly labeled a lepton .",
    "loss of efficiency at high @xmath4 is attributed to reduced charged multiplicity recoiling against high - energy photons ( and therefore greater likelihood of failing the minimum charged multiplicity requirement ) , as well as increased forward - peaking of photons towards the beampipe .",

    "note the suppressed zeroes.,width=302 ]",
    "after imposing our event selection and photon selection criteria , we determine the yield in the direct photon energy spectrum . given the limited statistics , we do not perform a two - dimensional analysis in both @xmath4 and @xmath60 , as was possible for the @xmath6 analysis . figure  [ fig : psipr - dkpigg - alloverlay ] shows the raw data , and the components used to extract the signal , for the pseudo - photon subtraction scheme .",

    "also shown in figure  [ fig : plot - all.eps](b ) is the mc signal spectrum , which ( given the absence of any real physics in the simulation ) would not necessarily be expected to show consistency with data .",
    "the mc spectrum does , nevertheless , illustrate the relative scale of our inclusive signal yield relative to the prominent @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 peak at @xmath540.34 .      excluding electromagnetic transitions to other charmonium states ( e.g. , @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 ) , two - body radiative exclusive modes should , in principle , be included in our total @xmath37 rate .",
    "although individual photon lines can not be resolved in our analysis , we note that this analysis yields a branching fraction estimate for @xmath14(2s)@xmath59x ( @xmath621.5 gev ) consistent with the tabulated particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite world average .        to determine @xmath5",
    ", we first directly take the ratio : @xmath63 .",
    "the number of @xmath64 events is obtained knowing the effective @xmath14(2s ) cross - section , as tabulated elsewhere  @xcite and subtracting off the branching fractions to @xmath65 , @xmath6 , @xmath66 , dileptons  @xcite , @xmath67 , and also the sought - after direct - photon branching fraction ( requiring an iteration ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath68 three - gluon events in our sample .",
    "prominent in both the monte carlo simulations and data points in figure  [ fig : plot - all.eps ] is the photon line due to @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 .",
    "we can also obtain an estimate of @xmath5 by normalizing the observed photon yield for @xmath53 to the photon yield observed corresponding to the decay @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 , peaking in the interval @xmath69 .",
    "this photon yield is obtained by fitting the putative @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 line to a double gaussian photon signal ( based on the signal shape observed in @xcite ) and a smooth lower - order chebyshev polynomial background . in this case , the absolute - photon finding largely cancels ; we must correct , however , by the different angular distributions for the processes @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 and @xmath14(2s)@xmath12 , since the latter is less forward - peaked than for the @xmath66 transition . defining @xmath70 as the angular acceptance for @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 relative to @xmath14(2s)@xmath12 ( @xmath250.88 ) , the value @xmath5 obtained by normalizing to the observed number @xmath71 of @xmath14(2s)@xmath61 events",

    "this expectation is satisfied for the case of the @xmath11 system .",
    "we have calculated @xmath77 , although we note that since the two signal extraction techniques are very different , the dominant systematic errors are largely uncorrelated for both numerator and denominator , so therefore , there is no cancellation of common systematic errors in this quotient .",
    "restricted to the interval @xmath560.4 , the ratio of @xmath37 partial widths for the @xmath14(2s ) compared to the @xmath6 is @xmath78 .",
    "assuming that the direct photon momentum spectral shape for the @xmath14(2s ) is similar to the @xmath6 , the fraction of photons in the region @xmath79 is approximately 28% of the entire spectrum , corresponding to a momentum - integrated value of @xmath80 , again about 2/3 the value obtained at the @xmath6 .",

    "although this low value in comparison to the @xmath6 may seem surprising , such apparent anomalies  @xcite are not uncommon when ratios of @xmath14(2s)/@xmath6 partial widths are taken .",
    "the well - known vp - suppression observed in @xmath14(2s ) exclusive hadronic decays@xcite can be considerably more dramatic , as is the recently documented dearth of radiative @xmath14(2s ) decays to @xmath46 and @xmath83  @xcite relative to those from @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the ratio of dileptonic to three - gluon widths ( @xmath84 ) is also considerably smaller for the @xmath14(2s ) compared to the @xmath6 .",
    "we have made the first measurement of the direct photon spectrum in @xmath14(2s ) decays , obtaining an inclusive rate ( relative to three - gluon decays ) approximately 2/3 that obtained at the @xmath6 , and suggesting larger @xmath14(2s ) corrections , possibly due to closer proximity to @xmath52 threshold .",
    "although theoretical predictions for this value are somewhat scarce , we note that this is now one of several apparent anomalies observed in ratios of widths between the @xmath14(2s ) and the @xmath6 .",
