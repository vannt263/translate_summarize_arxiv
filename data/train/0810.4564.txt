( 2 ) with the fine pixel scale ( @xmath15/pixel ) , one cycle of the small field photometry dither pattern was made at each of 12 cluster target positions , arranged in a rectangular grid with 16.22  ( 3.25-pixel ) spacing , for an effective exposure time of 12@xmath12(10@xmath123 ) seconds per pixel .",

    "the mips 160 @xmath1 m camera suffers from a spectral leak by which stray light in the wavelength range 1 - 1.6 @xmath1 m produces a false image partially overlapping the actual 160 @xmath1 m source image .",
    "this ghost image is several times brighter than the real disk emission in the case of @xmath0 eri , and must be subtracted accurately to enable study of the circumstellar emission .",
    "the spectral leak is field - dependent , and therefore can only be properly subtracted using a reference star that was observed with the same dither parameters as the science target .",
    "pre - launch observation planning did not anticipate this requirement , so no appropriate reference star observation was available initially to leak - subtract the @xmath0 eri dataset .",

    "observations of achernar ( @xmath8 eri ) were also obtained for @xmath0 eri leak subtraction reference , on 2005 august 30 .",
    "the achernar data did not support a good leak subtraction for @xmath0 eri , probably because of the large color difference between the two stars ( type b3 versus k2 ) .",
    "the mips instrument team s data analysis tool ( dat ; gordon et al .",

    "those observations were at two nod positions , with the star displaced from the center of the slit by a third of the slit length .",
    "total integration times per slit position or nod were 84 seconds in the sl1 spectral map , 70 seconds each in the ll2 and ll1 spectral maps , and 54 seconds , 72 seconds , and 144 seconds respectively for the sl2 , sh and lh observations .",
    "each set of observations was preceded by a high - accuracy pointing peak - up observation of the neighboring star sao 130582 using the irs blue ( 15 @xmath1 m ) camera .",
    "data reduction began with products of the _ spitzer _ science center s s11 irs data pipeline .",
    "further processing involved removal , by interpolation in the spectral direction , of permanently bad and  rogue  pixels identified in the irs dark - current data for all campaigns up to and including the one in which each @xmath0 eri spectrum was taken .",
    "the irs instrument team s smart software was then used to extract 1-d spectra from the 2-d long - slit ( sl , ll ) or echelle ( sh , lh ) images .",
    "sky emission in the sl and ll observations was measured by a linear fit to the signals at points along the slit farther than 40  from the star , and subtracted as part of the extraction .",
    "the @xmath0 eri system appeared to be spatially unresolved in the sl observations , so an extraction window was used that was fitted to the instrumental point - spread function at the longest wavelengths of each low - resolution module , 4 pixels wide in each case .",
    "a full - slit extraction was performed for the high - spectral - resolution ( sh and lh ) observations .",
    "the sky emission measured in the low - spectral - resolution observations was small enough compared with the flux received from @xmath0 eri and its disk that sky subtraction in the sh and lh observations could be neglected .",
    "reference sl and ll observations of @xmath8 lac ( a1 v ) plus sh and lh observations of @xmath20 dra ( k1 iii ) were obtained in the same manner as the @xmath0 eri observations .",
    "the spectra of @xmath0 eri were calibrated via division by spectra of the respective reference star taken at the corresponding nod position , multiplication by a synthetic template spectrum of the reference star ( cohen 2004 , private communication ) , and tben nod - averaging .",
    "reduced spectra from each spectrograph module were then combined to produce complete 5.338 @xmath1 m spectra .",
    "small spectrograph module - to - module differences at wavelengths of overlap were assumed to be due to minor telescope pointing - induced throughput losses , and removed by scaling up the spectra from smaller - slit modules to match those from the larger - slit modules in the overlap range .",
    "linearity and saturation in the irs detector arrays is corrected in the data pipeline , but @xmath0 eri and its disk are bright enough that linearity and saturation effects in the low - spectral - resolution modules are large and the corrections uncertain .",
    "the main impact of these effects is that the ll spectra had significantly lower effective signal - to - noise ratio and spectrophotometric accuracy than the sh and lh observations due to residual inaccuracy of the ll saturation correction .",
    "the final spectrum used in this paper was assembled from sl , sh and lh data ; ll data will not be discussed further . the uncertainty in flux density is 5% below about 10 jy , increasing to about 10% for flux densities as high as 20 jy .",

    "data reduction used the _ sharcsolve _ software package that iteratively decomposes fixed source emission , time variable atmospheric emission , and detector offsets .",
    "best results for subtraction of the temporally and spatially variable telluric emission were achieved by assuming that the average emission outside a 35  radius from the star was zero , at the cost of filtering out possible more widely extended emission .",
    "calibration was based on the integrated map signals within a 35  radius , following correction for atmospheric absorption , from sub - mm standards oh231.8 ( 18 jy ) , crl618 ( 19 jy ) , o ceti ( 2.3 jy ) , ceres ( 13 jy in 2003 january ) , and juno ( 8.0 jy in 2005 december ) .",

    "the timescale for grain - grain mutual collisions is :    @xmath94    in which @xmath95 is the orbit period and @xmath58 is the perpendicular optical depth .",

    "@xmath96 au , where p - r drag is most competitive with collisions , the collision time scale for the large ( @xmath97 @xmath1 m ) grains is @xmath98 yrs , whereas the wind - drag time scale for inward drift by @xmath99 au is @xmath100 yrs . thus , even when enhanced by wind , virtually all the large icy grains should be destroyed by collisions _ in situ _ and not be able to drift inward to fill the central void . for the small grains ( @xmath101 @xmath1 m ) , on the other hand , the collision destruction time scale ( including cross - sectional area of both small and large grains as targets ) is @xmath102 yrs , approximately the same as the wind - drag time scale for these particles to drift 1 au . given that the collision process is statistical , e.g.@xmath10 1% of grains can be expected to survive 5 @xmath103 , some fraction of the small grain population _ could _ travel inward from the sub - mm ring into the central void before colliding with other grains .    at the inner and outer edges of the halo , @xmath104 and 110 au respectively , the collision time scale for the small grains is also comparable to the @xmath99 au wind - drag drift time .",
