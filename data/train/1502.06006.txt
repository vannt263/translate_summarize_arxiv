    "a characteristic of random motion is the existence of many possible paths between two given positions . a trivial experiment to show this is to drop a small feather in the air from a top point to a fixed point below .",
    "the first time it goes down along a zigzag path , the second time another path , and so on .",
    "if each path is defined as a band with a reasonable thickness instead of a single geometrical line , it is possible to assign a probability of occurrence to each of these paths , or the probability for a particle to take . in principle , this probability can be experimentally measured by observing a large number of identical feathers moving down between the two points , and estimated by the number of feathers observed along this path , divided by the total number of feathers arriving at the end point below . in practice , this kind of experiments is not that easy because , in order to get reliable calculation of probability , one has to count a very large number of identical bodies moving between two points under identical conditions .    in a recent work@xcite ,",
    "we have proposed numerical measure of this probability by simulating the random motions subject to conservative forces .",
    "the aim of this probability measure is to determine its random variables .",
    "the random motion was generated by a langevin equation with gaussian noise .",
    "this numerical model is different from the above example of feathers in that there is no friction or energy dissipation on the falling bodies .",
    "this is an ideal motion or an asymptotic model for weakly damped random motion .",
    "the choice of this model , fully discussed in @xcite , is motivated by a theoretical study of path probability in the framework of a probabilistic hamiltonian mechanics based on a generalization of least action principle of the regular hamiltonian mechanics@xcite .",
    "according to this theory , if the system is perturbed by a gaussian white noise and statistically remains hamiltonian one without or with very weak dissipative force , the path probability should be exponentially decreasing function @xmath0 of the action @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the kinetic energy , @xmath3 the potential energy , @xmath4 a characteristic parameter of the randomness and the time integral is carried out along the considered path .",
    "this probability is a classical analog of the feynman s factor @xmath5 of quantum hamiltonian mechanics@xcite , the difference being that @xmath4 is a real number since the path probability must be real .",
    "the output of the numerical experiment has verified this theoretical prediction@xcite and confirmed the generalization of the regular least action principle under these conditions .    a question following",
    "this work is whether or not the same exponential path probability exists for dissipative random motion .",
    "the answer to this question is crucial for the description of random motions in nature since most of them , if not all , are dissipative or over - damped . in this work ,",
    "a analytical derivation of the path probability is provided first for the same dynamic model as in @xcite in the zero dissipation limit and then for the case with important dissipation .",
    "the reader will find the above mentioned exponential path probability exists for both models . in the zero dissipation limit ,",
    "the action is just the usual one as expected , while in the presence of important dissipation , the action is a new one suggested in a generalization of least action principle to dissipative motion@xcite .",
    "this new action recovers the usual action when the dissipation tends to zero .",
    "the model can be depicted as the following langevin equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the one dimensional position , @xmath8 the time , @xmath9 the potential energy , @xmath10 the friction force , and @xmath11 the random forces as a white noise .",
    "a discrete solution of this equation is @xmath12 which is a superposition of a gaussian distributed random displacement @xmath13 ( solution of the stochastic equation @xmath14 ) and a regular trajectory @xmath15 ( the solution of the newtonian equation @xmath16 ) corresponding to the least action path .",
    "although eq.([1 ] ) is not necessarily a linear equation in @xmath7 , eq.([2 ] ) is always its solution since the acceleration derivative @xmath17 is a linear operator .",
    "figure [ fig.1 ] illustrates some sample paths produced with eq.([2 ] ) between two positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , each of them being a tube of finite thickness @xmath20 ( a band in the @xmath21 representation ) .    ) for a random motion subject to the harmonic force and the gaussian noise.,width=5 ]    in the numerical experiment of the work @xcite , the number @xmath22 of the particles ( or geometrical lines ) going through a given sample path @xmath23 , i.e. , all the sequences of positions @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , is counted , where @xmath27 are the axial line of that tube and @xmath28 the total number of steps .",
    "the probability that the path @xmath23 is taken is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of particles ( trajectories ) moving from @xmath18 to @xmath19 through all the considered sample paths .",
    "the discrete normalization of @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total number of paths .    for each sample path",
    ", the instantaneous velocity of the particles of mass @xmath34 at the step @xmath35 is calculated by @xmath36 along the axial line .",
    "this velocity can be approximately considered as the average velocity of all the trajectories passing through the tube if @xmath20 is small with respect to the whole scale of the motion .",
