    "to any observer the night sky appears as a distribution of stars and constellations which could be mapped over a sphere @xmath0 called the _ sky_. this notion , converted into an appropriate geometrical object , can be found in foundational studies of relativity @xcite , as a key concept for expressing the relativity principle , or in studies of the causal structure of spacetime @xcite .",
    "two observers at the same spacetime event @xmath1 but relatively boosted will perceive a different night sky due to the phenomenon of stellar aberration . in the late fifties papers by terrell @xcite and",
    "penrose @xcite showed that the map between skies is conformal .",
    "one might assume that the result depends on the lorentz group , and should be derived making use of appropriate lorentz transformations .",
    "however , in this paper we shall show that it is much more robust and general , for it does not rely on symmetries of the observer space ( indicatrix ) .",
    "in relativity theory this space is @xmath2 and so it is homogeneous .",
    "furthermore , we shall show that in many cases it is possible to introduce _ an invariant metric _ on @xmath0 , not just a conformal one . in order to achive this result one should also consider the frequency of photons and not just their direction .",
    "in other words one should consider the full sky picture , not just points and shapes but also _",
    "color_.    in the remainder of this introduction let us recall the usual methods of proof .",
    "we use conventions according to which @xmath3 and the signature of the spacetime metric @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "the most straightforward argument is based on the lorentz transformation and goes as follows @xcite .",
    "let two inertial observer @xmath6 and @xmath7 be boosted and let coordinates be chosen so that the boost is in the @xmath8 direction for both observers , so that the velocity of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath6 is @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 be the velocities of any other particle as measured by the observers .",
    "the lorentz transformation for velocities is @xmath12 let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be polar coordinates for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . if the particle is really a photon coming from direction @xmath13 for @xmath6 then @xmath15 , and analogously for @xmath7 thus since @xmath16 @xmath17 this is the map @xmath18 between skies .",
    "differentiation of the former equation gives @xmath19 , thus denoting the canonical metric of @xmath0 with @xmath20 , the map between skies satisfies @xmath21 namely , it is conformal .",
    "penrose goes on to observe that the stereographic projection of @xmath0 on the complex plane @xmath22 is conformal .",
    "the map between skies is a conformal bijection of the extended complex space ( riemann sphere ) , and any conformal map of this type is really a fractional linear ( mbius ) transformation , and so sends circles into circles @xcite .",
    "the most general transformation is a composition of a rotation , a boost and a rotation , where rotations are trivially conformal and send circles into circles , so the just proved results hold for general transformations as well .",
    "given a uniformly moving sphere on minkowski spacetime there is an observer at the observation event for which the sphere is at rest and which therefore sees it with a circular profile .",
    "as a consequence , for any observer the profile of the sphere looks circular .",
    "the conformality of the sky map @xmath23 holds also for spacetimes of dimension @xmath24 .",
    "the proof remains the same , the angle @xmath25 would be dropped ( for @xmath26 ) or replaced by more angles @xmath27 , left unchanged by the boost . also by liouville s theorem",
    "it is still true that @xmath28 spheres are sent to spheres .",
    "penrose gave also a rather different proof of the conformality of the map based on spinor geometry @xcite .",
    "while his approach gives other insights into this map , it works just in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "let @xmath29 be a spacetime , namely a time oriented lorentzian manifold , and let us place our considerations on just a tangent space @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the event of observation .",
    "let @xmath32 be local coordinates on @xmath33 and let @xmath34 be induced coordinates on @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the future timelike cone at @xmath1 and let @xmath37 be its boundary ( the closure operator is in the slit tangent bundle @xmath38 ) namely the light cone , i.e.  the set of future lightlike vectors .",
    "observe that @xmath39 is an open convex sharp cone for every @xmath1 ( sharp means that @xmath39 does not contain lines ) .",
    "the _ observer space _ at @xmath1 is @xmath40 it is also called _ velocity space _ or _ indicatrix_. each point represents the covariant velocity of a massive particle / observer . for every @xmath31",
    ", @xmath41 can be regarded as a flat lorentzian manifold .",
    "the manifold @xmath42 on the spacetime @xmath43 is lightlike since for every @xmath44 the vector @xmath45 is lightlike , @xmath46 .    for @xmath47 ,",

    "the sky can be naturally endowed with a metric which is just the metric induced from @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath54 and define @xmath55 this is a riemannian metric on @xmath56 since , as mentioned , @xmath42 is lightlike @xcite .",

    "more precisely the projection on the projective space of @xmath48 determines a bijection @xmath68 between the skies where each point is sent to the point with the same projection .     and the geometrical construction related to the conformal map of skies , width=226 ]    now , there is some @xmath69 such that @xmath70 .",

    "equation ( [ odg ] ) provides a transparent covariant expression for the conformal factor .",
    "it depends on the direction of sight @xmath44 and on the two observers @xmath84 whose observations are being related .",
    "an important fact which does not seem to have been sufficently stressed is the following @xcite    the conformal factor relating the sky metrics is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the doppler factor , namely the ratio of the photon frequencies as observed by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this fact follows at once since for some @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the momenta of the photon . )",
    "we can write @xmath89 .",
    "in the coordinates of observer @xmath6 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and the contravariant momenta of the photon is @xmath92 , so one can easily check that the conformal factor is the squared doppler factor . ]",
    "since the relationship between the area forms on the skies induced by the conformal map is @xmath93^{n-1 } { { \\rm d}}v\\ ] ] we conclude ( under the assumption that from each direction there arrive photons of just one direction - dependent frequency )    in the observation of the night sky the product between the area of the observed patch of sky and the frequency of photons at power @xmath94 is independent of the observer .",
    "thus if we boost towards the big dipper the stars frequency will increase but the constellation will shrink since the product of its angular area times the frequency squared must be constant .    another suggestive interpretation of ( [ odg ] ) written in the form @xmath95 is this :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the sky has an intrinsic invariant metric which is revealed once the wavelength of the observed photons is used as unit angular scale_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    stated in another way :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if we measure the sky with the natural lengths provided by the sky itself , it shows the same geometry to all observers_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    these interpretations are valid provided the related observers have means to select the photons to be measured from the whole spectra they receive from each direction .",
    "for instance , let us consider a polyhedra moving on minkowski spacetime and let us suppose that in the rest frame every point of the surface emits light in any direction at the same frequency . then at the observation event any two observers taking snapshots would get different conformally related images . by taking into account the color of their own picture they can",
    ", by means of the metric ( [ lod ] ) , reach a value for the ( colored ) angular distance between vertices which is really independent of the observer .",
    "all that without communicating among themselves .",
    "they can even recover the shape that would be seen by that one observer who , being at rest with respect to the polyhedra , gets the whole picture in the same uniform color .",
    "similarly , one can consider the situation in which the object emits a black body radiation at temperature @xmath96 .",
    "let the observers agree to focus on any given direction to that spectral band which corresponds to the maximal intensity in the frequency domain ( these frequencies differ among the frames but select the same photons ) .",
    "by wien s law the _ thermal sky metric _ @xmath97 is independent of the observer , where @xmath98 is the observed temperature in direction @xmath99 .",
    "finally , let us consider the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and suppose that the two observers have agreed to retain , for each direction , just that portion of waveband which corresponds to the maximal intensity in the frequency domain .",
    "as a result they are observing the same photons and so the thermal sky metric @xmath100 is again independent of the observer .    perhaps , the best way to geometrically understand this result is by working on the slit contangent bundle @xmath101 .",
    "we can repeat similar constructions : define the polar cone @xmath102 , its boundary @xmath103 , and the metric @xmath104 . then given a section @xmath105 , namely given a photon momenta for every line of sight",
    ", we can define a metric on @xmath106 by @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are representatives for @xmath110 .",
    "this metric coincides with ( [ lod ] ) , though the former clarifies the conformal connection with the usual sky metric .",
    "in this section we consider a more general finslerian framework . we shall be able to repeat the previous arguments thus showing that the conformality of the transformation of skies is a robust result which is independent of the symmetries of the observer space .",
    "this fact shows once again that lorentz transformations are not required for the derivation of the result .",
    "let @xmath111 be a distribution of open convex sharp cones on the tangent bundle @xmath112 , with vertex in the zero section .",
    "this means that @xmath39 is an open convex sharp cone for every @xmath1 .",
    "a _ finsler lagrangian _ is a map @xmath113 which is positive homogeneous of degree two in the fiber coordinates @xmath114 in this work we assume that the fiber dependence is at least @xmath115 , that @xmath116 on @xmath99 and that @xmath117 can be @xmath118-continuously extended setting @xmath119 on @xmath120 . here",
    "closure is understood in the slit tangent bundle @xmath38 .",
    "the matrix metric is defined as the hessian of @xmath117 with respect to the fibers @xmath121 and we assume that it can be continuously extended to @xmath120 preserving the lorentzian signature .",
    "this matrix can be used to define a metric in two different , but essentially equivalent ways .",
    "the finsler metric is typically defined as @xmath122 and is a map @xmath123 . for any given @xmath1 one could also use this matrix to define a vertical metric on @xmath39 as follows @xmath124 . usually the context clarifies which one is used , nevertheless , in this work we shall use the latter metric . in index",
    "free notation the metric will be also denoted @xmath125 to stress the dependence on the fiber coordinates .    by positive homogeneity",
