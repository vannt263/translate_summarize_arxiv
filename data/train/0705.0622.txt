    "we investigated two - dimensional electron systems with static random magnetic flux and showed numerically that the transport properties depend on the parity of the system s width @xmath10 and on the transverse boundary conditions .",
    "for dirichlet boundary conditions , we confirmed by the analysis of the statistical properties of the quantities @xmath16 , which parameterize the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix , that the system possesses chiral unitary symmetry at the band center .",
    "the chirality exists in case of dirichlet boundary conditions for both @xmath10 odd and even , and for periodic bc for @xmath10 even only .",
    "but the chirality is always broken when the energy of the electron is non - zero .    in case of chiral unitary symmetry , the 2d system with random magnetic flux possesses a critical point at the band center .",
    "we found that the localization length diverges @xmath138 when @xmath139 and calculated the critical exponent @xmath140 for @xmath10 odd and dirichlet bc .",
    "our data do not confirm the existence of the crossover from the power - law to the logarithmic energy dependence of @xmath141 predicted by ref  .",
    "we also calculated the critical conductance of 2d systems . at the band center",
    ", the mean conductance @xmath127 converges to a size - independent critical value for both @xmath10 odd and @xmath10 even . although the critical conductance does depend on the strength of the randomness",
    ", the fluctuations of the conductance appear to be universal .",
    "for non - zero energy , the mean conductance decreases with the system size , indicating a localized regime . finally , for the quasi-1d systems with odd system width and dirichlet bc , we confirmed the non - trivial length dependence of the mean conductance , proposed theoretically in ref .  .",
