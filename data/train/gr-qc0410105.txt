    "as is well known , weyl solutions @xcite represent the family of all static and axially  symmetric exterior solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "since there are as many different weyl solutions as there are different harmonic functions ( see next section ) , then the obvious question arises : what is the exact vacuum solution to the einstein equations corresponding to a given non ",
    "spherical , static axially symmetric source ( an ellipsoid , say ) ? .",
    "if the field is not particularly intense ( @xmath0 ) and the deviation from spherical symmetry is sligth , then there is not problem in representing the corresponding field ( both inside and outside the source ) as a suitable perturbation of the spherically symmetric exact solution .",
    "however , as the object becomes more and more compact , such perturbative scheme will eventually fail .    indeed ,",
    "as it is well known @xcite , the only static and asymptotically  flat vacuum space  time possessing a regular horizon is the schwarzschild solution . for all the others weyl exterior solutions @xcite , the physical components of the riemann tensor exhibit singularities at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is intuitively clear that as @xmath2 approaches @xmath3 and gravitational field becomes stronger , the properties of sources of weyl space  time should start drastically to differ from the properties of spherical sources @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that this sharp difference in the behaviour of both types of sources ( for very high gravitational fields ) is independent on how small , multipole moments ( higher than monopole ) of the weyl source , are .",
    "this is so because , as @xmath2 approaches @xmath3 , any finite perturbation of the schwarzschild space  time becomes fundamentally different from any weyl solution , even when the latter is characterized by parameters whose values are arbitrarily close to those corresponding to the spherical symmetry .",
    "this point has been stressed before @xcite , but usually it has been overlooked .",
    "furthermore in a recent work @xcite it was shown that for a non  spherical source ( even in the case of slight deviations from spherical symmetry ) , the speed of entering the collapse regime decreases substantially , as compared with the exactly spherically symmetric case . in the same order of ideas",
    "it has been shown @xcite that small departures from sphericity , produce significant decreasing ( increasing ) in the values of active gravitational mass of collapsing ( expanding ) spheres , with respect to its value in equilibrium , enhancing thereby the stability of the system .",
    "also , the sensitivity of the trajectories of test particles in the @xmath4 spacetime , to small changes of @xmath4 , for orbits close to @xmath3 , has been brought out @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that all these effects take place for strong gravitational fields , but for @xmath5 .",
    "these works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite were done using as weyl solution , the so  called gamma metric ( @xmath6metric ) @xcite .",
    "this metric , which is also known as zipoy - vorhees metric , belongs to the family of weyl s solutions , and is continuously linked to the schwarzschild space ",
    "time through one of its parameters .",
    "the motivation for this choice was that the exterior @xmath6metric corresponds to a solution of the laplace equation ( in cylindrical coordinates ) with the same singularity structure as the schwarzschild solution ( a line segment @xcite ) . in this sense",
    "the @xmath6metric appears as the `` natural '' generalization of schwarzschild space - time to the axisymmetric case .",
    "however , the existence of so many different ( physically distinguishable @xcite ) weyl solutions gives rise to the question : which among weyl solutions is better entitled to describe small deviations from spherical symmetry ? .",
    "although it should be obvious that such a question does not have a unique answer ( there is an infinite number of ways of being non  spherical , so to speak ) , we shall invoke a very simple criterion , emerging from newtonian gravity , in order to choose our solution .    indeed , in order to answer the question above , let us recall @xcite that most known weyl solutions , present a drawback when describing quasi  spherical space  times .",
    "it consists of the fact that its multipole structure is such that multipole moments , higher than quadrupole , are of the same order as the quadrupole moment .",
    "instead , as it is intuitively clear , the relevance of such multipole moments should decrease as we move from lower to higher moments , the quadrupole moment being the most relevant for a small departure from sphericity .",
    "thus for example in newtonian gravity , multipole moments of an ellipsoid of rotation , with homogeneous density , and axes ( a , a , b ) read : @xmath7 , \\,\\,\\",
    ", \\epsilon\\equiv ( a - b)/a,\\nonumber\\\\ d_{2n+1 } & = & 0\\nonumber \\end{array } \\right.,\\ ] ] because of the factor @xmath8 , this equation clearly exhibits the progressive decreasing of the relevance of multipole moments as @xmath9 increases .",
    "thus , in order to describe small departures from sphericity , by means of exact solution to the einstein equations , we would require an exact solution whose multipole structure shares the property mentioned above .",
    "fortunately enough , such solution exists @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is one ( exact ) solution of the weyl family , which may be interpreted as a quadrupole correction to the schwarzschild space  time ( see below ) .",
    "it is for this exterior metric that we are going to construct a source .",
    "the motivation for this is twofold : on the one hand , it is always interesting to propose bounded and physically reasonable sources of gravitational fields , which may serve as models of compact object . on the other hand ,",
    "spherical symmetry is a common assumption in the study of compact self  gravitating objects ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes ) .",
    "therefore it is pertinent to ask , how do small deviations from this assumption , related to any kind of perturbation ( e.g. fluctuations of the stellar matter , external perturbations , etc . ) , affect the properties of the system ? .",
    "however , as mentioned before , for sufficiently strong fields , in order to answer to this question it is necessary to deal with non  spherically symmetric exact solution to the einstein equations .    for constructing the source we shall follow a prescription given by hernn - dez @xcite allowing to obtain interior solutions of weyl space ",
    "time , from known spherically symmetric interior solutions .",
    "our interior solution will be obtained from the interior schwarzschild solution ( homogeneous density ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "the next section we review weyl solutions and the concept of relativistic multipoles . in section 3",
    "we describe the m ",
    "q solution @xcite and give its properties .",
    "the hernndez method is applied in section 4 to obtain an interior to the m ",
    "q solution .",
    "finally , results are discussed in the last section .",
    "static axysymmetric solutions to the einstein equations are given by the weyl metric @xcite @xmath10 , \\label{elin}\\ ] ] where metric functions have to satisfy @xmath11 and @xmath12    observe that ( [ meq1 ] ) is just the laplace equation for @xmath13 ( in the euclidean space ) , and furthermore it represents the integrability condition for ( [ meq2 ] ) , implying that for any `` newtonian '' potential we have a specific weyl metric , a well known result .",
    "the general solution of the laplace equation ( [ meq1 ] ) for the function @xmath13 , presenting an asymptotically flat behaviour , results to be @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are weyl spherical coordinates and @xmath17 are legendre polynomyals .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 are arbitrary real constants which have been named in the literature `` weyl moments '' , although they can not be identified as relativistic multipole moments in spite of the formal similarity between expression ( [ psi ] ) and the newtonian potential .    another interesting way of writting the solution ( [ psi ] ) was obtained by erez  rosen @xcite and quevedo @xcite , integrating equations ( [ meq1 ] ) , ( [ meq2 ] ) in prolate spheroidal coordinates , which are defined as follows @xmath19^{1/2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",
    "x_{\\,\\ , } & \\geq & 1 \\quad , \\quad -1 \\leq y \\leq 1 , \\label{pro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is an arbitrary constant which will be identified later with the schwarzschild s mass .",
    "inverse relation between both families of coordinates is given by @xmath21 the prolate coordinate @xmath22 represents a radial coordinate , whereas the other coordinate , @xmath23 represents the cosine function of the polar angle .    in these prolate spheroidal coordinates @xmath13 takes the form @xmath24 being @xmath25 legendre functions of second kind and @xmath26 a set of arbitrary constants .",
    "the corresponding expression for the function @xmath27 , has been obtained by quevedo @xcite    a sub  family of weyl solutions has been obtained by gutsunaev and manko @xcite , @xcite starting from the schwarzchild solution as a `` seed '' solution .    both sets of coefficients , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , characterize any weyl metric @xcite . nevertheless , as mentioned before",
    ", these constants do not give us physical information about the metric since they do not represent the `` real '' multipole moments of the source .",
    "that is not the case for the relativistic multipole moments firstly defined by geroch @xcite , and subsequently by hansen @xcite and thorne @xcite , which , as it is known , characterize completely and uniquely , at least in the neighbourhood of infinity , every asymptotycally flat and stationary vacuum solution @xcite , providing at the same time a physical description of the corresponding solution .",
    "an algorithm to calculate the geroch multipole moments was developed by g. fodor , c. hoenselaers and z. perjes @xcite ( fhp ) . by applying such method ,",
    "the resulting multipole moments of the solution are expressed in terms of the weyl moments .",
    "similar results are obtained from the thorne s definition , using harmonic coordinates .",
    "the structure of the obtained relation between coefficients @xmath18 and these relativistic moments allows to express the weyl moments as a combination of the geroch relativistic moments .      in this section",
    "we would like to describe the properties of a solution ( hereafter referred to as the @xmath30 solution @xcite ) which is particularly suitable for the study of perturbations of the spherical symmetry . the main argument to support this statement",
    "is based on the fact that previously known weyl metrics ( e.g. gutsunaev  manko @xcite , manko @xcite , gamma metric @xcite , curzon @xcite , etc . )",
    "have a multipolar structure ( in the geroch sense ) such that all the moments higher than the quadrupole , are of the same order as the quadrupole .",
    "in fact for the above mentioned metrics we have ( odd moments are of course vanishing ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the quadrupole parameter in the erez - rosen metric . for the gamma metric results to be @xmath33 and finally , curzon",
    "metric is the worst case of the mentioned metrics since it posseses a unique parameter which represents the mass , and all higher moments are proportional to increasing powers of that parameter , i.e. , @xmath34 in @xcite it was shown that it is possible to find a solution of the weyl family , by a convenient choice of coefficients @xmath18 , such that the resulting solution possesses only monopole and quadrupole moments ( in the geroch sense ) @xcite . the obtained solution ( @xmath30 ) may be written as a finite series of gutsunayev  manko @xcite and erez  rosen @xcite solutions , as follows : @xmath35 where the zeroth order corresponde to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "@xmath36 with @xmath37 and it appears that each power in @xmath38 adds a quadrupole correction to the spherically symmetric solution .",
    "now , it should be observed that due to the linearity of laplace equation , these corrections give rise to a series of exact solutions . in other words ,",
    "the power series of @xmath38 may be cut at any order , and the partial summatory , up to that order , gives an exact solution representing a quadrupolar correction to the schwarzschild solution .    the simplest way to interpret physically the exact solutions obtained from the quadrupolar corrections described above ,",
    "consists in analyzying the corresponding multipolar structure .",
    "thus , it can be shown that cutting solution ( [ ( 15 ) ] ) at some order @xmath39 , one obtains an exact solution with the following properties :    * both , the monopole and the quadrupole moments are non  vanishing : + @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "* all the remaining moments until order @xmath42 ( included ) vanish .",
    "* all moments above the @xmath42pole are of order @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the solution represents a quadrupolar correction to the schwarzschild solution , which is an exact solution up to the given order .    to illustrate further our point ,",
    "let us present the explicit solution up to first order , describing a quadrupolar correction to the monopole .",
    "the correspondig metric functions read ( note a misprint in the equation ( 13 ) in @xcite ) @xmath44 @xmath45 , \\label{(25)}\\ ] ]    @xmath46 \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{75}{16}q^2 x^2\\frac{1-y^2}{x^2-y^2 } - \\frac{5}{4}q(x^2+y^2 ) \\frac{1-y^2}{(x^2-y^2)^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{75}{192}q^2(2x^6-x^4 + 3x^4y^2 - 6x^2y^2 + 4x^2y^4-y^4-y^6 ) \\frac{1-y^2}{(x^2-y^2)^4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{15}8 q x(1-y^2)\\left[1- \\frac{15}{32}q\\left(x^2 + 7y^2 - 9x^2y^2 + 1-\\frac83 \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2-y^2}\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\ln\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x+1}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{(26)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first twelve geroch moments of this solution are ( odd moments vanish because of the reflexion symmetry ) @xmath47 from the expressions above , it is apparent that the parameter @xmath48 representing the quadrupole moment , enters into the multipole moments @xmath49 , for @xmath50 , only at order @xmath51 or higher . accordingly , solution ( [ ( 25)])([(26 ) ] ) for an small value of @xmath38 , up to order @xmath38 , may be interpreted as the gravitational field outside a quasi  spherical source .",
    "the spacetime being represented by a quadrupole correction to the monopole ( schwarzschild ) solution .",
    "this is in contrast with other previuosly mentioned solutions of weyl family , where all moments higher than the quadrupole are of the same order in @xmath38 as the quadrupole , and therefore for small values of @xmath38 they can not be interpreted as a quadrupole perturbation of spherical symmetry .",
    "instead of cylindrical corrdinates @xmath52 , it will be useful for the next section to work with erez - rosen coordinates @xmath53 given by : @xmath54 and related to prolate coordinates , by @xmath55    the metric functions of the solution , up to the first order in @xmath38 , hereafter refered as m - q@xmath56 are : @xmath57    @xmath58-\\frac{15}{8 } q ( 1-y^2)(r-1)\\ln\\left(1-\\frac2r\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\vspace{0.2 cm } & -&\\frac{15}{4 } q ( 1-y^2)-\\frac54 q(1-y^2 ) \\left[\\frac{(r-1)^2+y^2}{((r-1)^2-y^2)^2}\\right ] , \\label{(30.2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath59 .",
    "an study of the geodesics in this spacetime , has been recently presented @xcite    in the next section we shall construct a source for m - q@xmath56 solution .",
    "the hernndez method @xcite is based on a heuristic procedure which allows , starting with some spherically symmetric `` seed '' source , to obtain interior solutions describing axialsymmetric static sources , which match smoothly on the boundary surface , to a given metric of the weyl family ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "some applications of this method may be found in @xcite .    for our exterior spacetime we shall choose the @xmath60 solution described above ( up to first order in @xmath38 ) and",
    "our `` seed '' interior fluid will be the incompressible schwarzschild interior solution .",
    "thus , our exterior metric in erez ",
    "rosen coordinates read : @xmath61 where the metric functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{(30.2n)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , darmois conditions , in these coordinates , imply that metric components as well as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are continuosus across the boundary surface ( but allows a jump in @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , in the example given by hernndez @xcite , the following substitutions on the chosen exterior metric were applied , in order to obtain the interior metric : @xmath70 for the @xmath71 metric component and the following one for the other metric components @xmath72 ^ 2 , \\label{43}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the equation of the boundary surface of the source and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 denoting the energy density of the spherically symmetric `` seed '' solution . since ( [ 42 ] )",
    "does not have a continuous derivative at the surface , but ( [ 43 ] ) has , it is clear that darmois conditions will be satisfied by the so obtained metric , on the boundary surface .",
    "however , in our case these substitutions lead to a metric whose @xmath71 component is singular at the origin .",
    "thus as a first step , we are going to modify the hernndez rule , concerning the @xmath71 component . in order to have a regular metric at the origin , we shall use ( [ 43 ] ) in those terms of @xmath71 which produce the singularity at the origin and ( [ 42 ] ) in the remaining terms . for the others metric components we apply ( [ 43 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we modify the spherical factor in @xmath76 and @xmath77 by substituing @xmath78 with @xmath79 , in order to ensure regularity at the origin ( however , as we shall see below this is not enough to assure the correct physical behaviour at the centre ) .",

    "\\label{(33)}\\ ] ]    we can now calculate the components of the energy  momentum tensor .",
    "however when this is done , negative values of the energy density close to the center appear , even in the weak field limit . to solve this problem and to assure a correct physical behaviour of all physical variables",

    "it should be observed that since both @xmath38 and its first derivative are continuous across the boundary surface , junction conditions are satisfied , after the replacement above .",
    "the specific form of @xmath101 as well as the values of different parameters , are indicated in figure 1 and in its legend .",
    "thus our source consists of a spherical inner core continuously matched to a non  spherical distribution of matter , producing a m - q@xmath56 spacetime at the outside , and satisfying the continuity of the first and the second fundamental forms at the boundary surface .",
    "calculations of different physical variables show their correct physical behaviour within the matter distribution .",
    "expressions are extremely lengthy and therefore we omit them here , however they are available upon request to w. barreto .",
    "the non  vanishing components are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . for @xmath107",
    "all these components are regular within the fluid distribution and energy conditions are satisfied ( e.g. energy density is positive and larger than stresses ) . in the weak field limit ( @xmath108 )",
    "we obtain a quadrupole correction to the incompressible fluid .",
    "we have seen that the m - q@xmath56 solution satisfies the requested condition to be considered as a quadrupole correction to the spherical symmetry , namely : all relativistic moments higher than the quadrupole are of higher order in @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly it represents , among the known members of the weyl family , a good candidate to describe small departures from spherical symmetry .",
    "next , we have found a source for that space  time .",
    "the interior solution obtained by an application of the hernndez algorithm , matchs smoothly to the m - q@xmath56 metric on the boundary of the matter distribution , is regular and satisfies all standard physical conditions . in the weak field approximation it represents a quadrupole correction to the incompressible fluid sphere .",
    "as we have mentioned before , a spherical core was introduced in order to assure acceptable physical behaviour at the centre .",
    "it consists of a sphere of incompressible fluid with possitive energy density , larger than pressure and which matches smoothly to the outer part of the source . for the models presented below the spherical core represents about the @xmath109 of the total volume of the source .",
    "since we are interested in slight deviations from spherical symmetry we shall consider models with very small values of @xmath38 . indeed",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath38 s in the models presented are many orders of magnitude smaller than the values corresponding to the earth and the sun , which in our units are approximately @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively @xcite .",
    "however for a neutron star of one solar mass , @xmath112 km radius and the same eccentricity as the sun , the order of magnitude of @xmath38 is @xmath113 @xcite , as in one of the models below .",
    "we have ran a large number of models for a wide range of values of the parameters and , both , positive and negative @xmath38 s .",
    "below we show figures corresponding to two models , one with small @xmath39 and the other with a value of @xmath39 close to its critical value . in both models we considered negative values of @xmath38 since we are primarily interested in oblate objects .",
    "figures 25 exhibit the behaviour of physical variables for an small value of @xmath39 ( weak field limit ) . despite the small value of the quadrupole parameter",
    ", its contribution is clearly shown in figures 24 . in figure 5",
    "the numerical error is comparable with the quadrupole contribution , and accordingly the latter is somehow screened by the former .",
    "figures 6 - 8 display the physical variables for a large value of @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", the quadrupole correction appears sharply in @xmath102 and @xmath106 .",
    "however it is neglectable in @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "it is our hope that this source as well as other interiors to some weyl metrics presented elsewhere ( @xcite and @xcite ) could be used as initial configurations to describe the departure from equilibrium of very compact objects endowed with an small but non  vanishing quadrupole structure .",
