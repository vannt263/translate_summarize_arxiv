    "the models incorporating event - driven uncertainties are increasingly becoming popular in finance , economics , engineering , medical sciences , ecology and many other branches of sciences . for example , in finance , often the stock price movements are suddenly and significantly influenced by market crashes , market booms , announcements made by central banks , changes in credit ratings , defaults , etc .",
    "the stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) driven by lvy noise are more realistic models to be used in such event - driven phenomena .",
    "some of the references are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the lvy driven sdes rarely possess explicit solutions , that necessitates the development of numerical schemes to approximate their solutions .",
    "recently , many explicit and implicit numerical schemes of lvy driven sdes have been studied and their convergence in strong as well as in weak sense have been proved .",
    "the interested reader may refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite along with their references for a comprehensive discussion on numerous numerical schemes of different orders .    in @xcite",
    ", authors have shown that the efficient euler schemes of sdes ( without jumps ) with super - linearly growing drift coefficients diverge in @xmath0-sense .",
    "several numerical schemes based on taming techniques have been proposed in the past few years to overcome these difficulties .",
    "one could refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for order @xmath1 tamed euler schemes and @xcite and @xcite for order @xmath2 tamed milstein schemes of sdes ( without jumps ) . for @xmath1 order",
    "tamed schemes of sdes driven by lvy noise , the only reference available to us is @xcite .",
    "the taming techniques proposed in this article can be extended to any desired order of convergence . however , for mathematical simplicity , we discuss order @xmath2 tamed milstein scheme of lvy driven sdes with super - linearly growing drift coefficients .",
    "it can also be concluded that our methodology and techniques can be extended to a tamed scheme of any order of convergence when drift coefficient grows super - linearly .",
    "further , our calculations are motivated by the classical methodology ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) and hence are more refined than those present in the literature . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first article on milstein schemes of sdes driven by lvy noise when drift coefficient grows super - linearly .",
    "we conclude this section by introducing some basic notations .",
    "we use @xmath3 to denote the euclidean norm of a @xmath4-dimensional vector @xmath5 , whereas @xmath6 for the hilbert - schmidt norm of a @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 .",
    "also , the transpose of the matrix @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the inner product of two @xmath4-dimensional vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13th element of a @xmath4-dimensional vector is denoted by @xmath14 , whereas @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for @xmath17th element and @xmath18th column of a @xmath19 matrix @xmath8 respectively , for @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the notation @xmath22 stands for the integer part of a positive real number @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we use @xmath23 to denote a generic constant , which is independent of @xmath24 and varies from place to place .",
    "let @xmath25 be a complete filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions , i.e. the filtration is right continuous and @xmath26 contains all @xmath27-null sets .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 is a fixed constant .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 is an @xmath30valued standard wiener process .",
    "also let @xmath31 be @xmath32-finite measure space and @xmath33 be poisson random measure defined on @xmath31 with intensity @xmath34 satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "we set @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be @xmath39-measurable functions with values in @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",

    "moreover , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath42 are assumed to be twice differentiable functions in @xmath45 .",
