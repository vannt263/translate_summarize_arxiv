    "while running the first generation dama / nai apparatus ( @xmath0 100 kg highly radiopure nai(tl ) ) @xcite , dama proposed to realize a ton apparatus in 1996 @xcite .",
    "thus , a second generation r&d project for highly radiopure nai(tl ) detectors was funded and carried out over several years with leader companies in order to realize , as a new step , a second generation experiment with an exposed mass of about 250 kg .",
    "the @xmath0 250 kg highly radiopure nai(tl ) dama / libra ( large sodium iodide bulk for rare processes ) apparatus has been designed and built mainly to further investigate the dark matter particle component(s ) in the galactic halo by exploiting the annual modulation signature ; it also aims to improve the investigation of several rare processes .",
    "dama / nai completed its data taking in july 2002 and the installation of dama / libra started ( see fig .",
    "[ assem ] ) .",
    "dama / libra has begun first operations in march 2003 .    in the present paper the dama / libra apparatus and , in particular , the features of its new detectors , developed by means of the second generation r&d , are described .",
    "highly radiopure nai(tl ) scintillators have been chosen as target  detector material for particle dark matter investigations since they offer many competitive aspects ; among them we remind : 1 ) well known technology ; 2 ) high radiopurity reachable by material selections and protocols , by chemical / physical purifications , etc . ; 3 ) large mass feasible ; 4 ) high duty cycle ; 5 ) routine calibrations feasible down to kev range in the same conditions as the production runs ; 6 ) well controlled operational conditions and monitoring feasible ; 7 ) absence of microphonic noise ; 8) suitable signal / noise discrimination near the energy threshold profiting of the relatively high available number of photoelectrons / kev and of the well different timing structures of the pmt noise pulses ( single fast photoelectrons with decay time of order of tens of ns ) with respect to the nai(tl ) scintillation pulses ( time distribution with time decay of order of hundreds of ns ) ; 9 ) high light response , that is kev threshold really reachable ; 10 ) no necessity of re - purification or cooling down / warming up procedures ( implying high reproducibility , high stability , etc . ) ; 11 ) possibility to exploit the granularity of the apparatus , an interesting feature for dark matter particle investigations and for background recognition ; 12 ) sensitivity to both high ( by iodine target ) and low ( by na target ) mass wimp ( weakly interacting massive particles ) candidates ; 13 ) high sensitivity to the class of wimp candidates with spin - independent ( si ) , spin - dependent ( sd ) and mixed ( si&sd ) couplings ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; 14 ) high sensitivity to several other existing scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite ) and to many other possible candidates including those producing just electromagnetic radiation in the interaction ; 15 ) possibility to effectively investigate the annual modulation signature in all the needed aspects ; 16 ) `` ecologically clean '' apparatus , thus no safety problems ; 17 ) technique cheaper than every other considered in the field ; 18 ) small underground space needed ; 19 ) pulse shape discrimination feasible at reasonable level when of interest .",
    "moreover , highly radiopure nai(tl ) scintillators can also offer the possibility to achieve significant results on several other rare processes  as already done by the dama / nai apparatus  such as e.g. @xcite : i ) possible violation of pauli exclusion principle in @xmath1i and in @xmath2na ; ii ) electron stability ; iii ) charge non - conserving processes ; iv ) search for solar axions ; v ) search for exotic matter ; vi ) search for spontaneous transition of nuclei to a superdense state ; vii ) search for spontaneous emission of heavy clusters in @xmath1i ; viii ) search for possible nucleon , di - nucleon and tri - nucleon decays into invisible channels ; etc .",
    "the main parts of the experimental apparatus are : i ) the installation ; ii ) the multicomponent passive shield ; iii ) the 25 highly radiopure nai(tl ) detectors ; iv ) the glove - box for calibrations ; v ) the electronic chain and the monitoring / alarm system ; vi ) the data acquisition ( daq ) system .",
    "all the materials constituting the apparatus have been selected for low radioactivity by measuring samples with low background ge detector deep underground in the gran sasso national laboratory and/or by mass spectrometry ( ms ) and by atomic absorption spectroscopy ( aas ) .      a schematic view of the building housing the dama / libra experimental apparatus is shown in fig .

    "two mechanical systems allow the lowering of the front and the back sides of the shield through an electric engine and , hence , to access the detectors during their installation ( also see fig .",

    "the inner cu box is also continuously flushed with hp nitrogen and maintained in slight overpressure with respect to its external environment ( this is the third level of sealing from external air in the underground laboratory ) .",
    "the pipes are filled with low radioactivity cu bars ( covered by 10 cm of low radioactive cu and 15 cm of low radioactive pb ) which can be removed to allow the insertion of radioactive sources holders for calibrating the detectors in the same running condition without any contact with the installation environment .",

    "the huge heat capacity of the multi - tons passive shield ( @xmath11 cal@xmath12c ) assures further a relevant stability of the detectors operating temperature .",

    "the supronyl coverage ( see above ) and the mentioned about 1 m concrete complete the dama / libra shield .",
    "the sealed cu box , the plexiglass box ( both flushed with hp n@xmath13 ) and the supronyl represent the 3-level sealing system from environmental air in the laboratory .",
    "moreover , the radon level inside the installation ( that is just after the first more external level of sealing from external air ) is continuously monitored and it is at the level of sensitivity of the radon - meter ; it is continuously recorded with the production data .",
    "\\a )   b )     [ cubox ]    specific procedures for preparing and handling the lead and copper bricks have also been selected .",
    "in particular , they have been chemically etched in a class 1000 clean room by using , respectively , hno@xmath22 and hcl aqueous solution in iper - pure water ( conductivity = 0.0548 @xmath23s / cm at 25 @xmath24c ) .",
    "as an example , the main steps followed for the inner cu etching are summarized here : i ) vessel i : pre - washing of the brick in iper - pure water ; ii ) vessel ii : washing in 1.5 l of super - pure hcl 3 m ; iii ) vessel iii : first rinse with iper - pure water ( bath ) ; iv ) vessel iv : second rinse with iper - pure water ( current ) ; v ) vessel v : washing in 1.5 l of ultra - pure hcl 0.5 m ; vi ) vessel vi : first rinse with iper - pure water ( bath ) ; vii ) vessel vii : second rinse with iper - pure water ( current ) ; viii ) vessel viii : third rinse with iper - pure water ( current ) ; ix ) the cu brick is dried with selected clean towels and hp n@xmath13 flux ; x ) finally , the cu brick is sealed in two envelopes ( one inside the other ) previously flushed and filled with hp n@xmath13 and stored underground until their mounting .",
    "the residual contaminants in the hcl used in solution with iper - pure water are certified by the producer .",
    "in particular , standard contaminants are quoted to be : 10 ppb of @xmath19k and 1 ppb of u / th for super - pure hcl and 100 ppt of @xmath19k and 1 ppt of u / th for ultra - pure hcl .",
    "for each brick the bath was changed and after each step the solution of the bath was analyzed with icp - ms technique .",
    "residual contaminants were preliminarily checked in order to optimize the choice of the materials ( in particular for gloves ) and the cleaning procedure .",
    "moreover special tools have been built ( by using teflon and high radiopure ofhc copper ) to manage the bricks in order to minimize the contact with gloves in presence of acid solution .",
    "icp - ms measurements assure the same radiopurity characteristics of the iper - pure water used in the last rinse , before and after the rinse .",
    "the @xmath25 kg nai(tl ) dama / libra apparatus uses 25 nai(tl ) highly radiopure detectors with 9.70 kg mass each one ( @xmath14 cm@xmath9 volume ) placed in five rows by five columns .",
    "the granularity of the apparatus is an interesting feature for dark matter particle investigations since dark matter particles can just contribute to events where only one of the 25 detectors fires ( @xmath26 events ) and not to whose where more than one detector fire in coincidence ( @xmath27 events ) .",
    "the new dama / libra detectors have been built by saint gobain crystals and detectors company .",
    "the constituting materials have been selected by using several techniques ; moreover , chemical / physical purifications of the selected powders have been exploited .",
    "in addition , the more effective growing procedure has been applied and new rules for handling the bare crystals have been fixed .",
    "each detector is sealed in low radioactivity freshly electrolyzed copper housing and has two 10 cm long highly radiopure quartz ( suprasil b ) light guides which also act as optical windows being directly coupled to the bare crystals .",
    "the bare crystals have been built by kyropoulos method @xcite in a platinum crucible according to a strict growing and handling protocol developed and agreed under confidential restriction .",
    "the seed , used in the growing , was from previous growth for highly radiopure nai(tl ) .",
    "the kyropoulos method  following the specific protocol agreed with the saint gobain crystals and detectors company  has been adopted since it assures in particular : i ) possibility to operate in a well controlled overall situation for ( radio)purity ; ii ) significant ( radio)purification during the growing process ; iii ) high performances of the detectors .",
    "other growing processes for nai(tl ) , such as the bridgeman @xcite was tested in the past and abandoned since it offered in our experience lower performances , mainly as regards the ( radio)purification during growth .",
    "the used nai powders have preliminarily been selected for radiopurity by various methods ; then , chemical / physical procedures for the further radiopurification have been exploited by saint gobain crystals and detectors company .",
    "the final residual contaminants in the powders are 0.02 ppb for @xmath16u , 0.02 ppb for @xmath17th and @xmath28 ppm ( 95% c.l . ) for @xmath19k , respectively , as measured by ms and aas . as regards the selected tli powder , the residual contaminants in the powders after the chemical / physical purifications are 0.8 ppb for @xmath16u , 1.2 ppb for @xmath17th and @xmath29 ppm ( 95% c.l . ) for @xmath19k , respectively , as measured by ms and aas .",
    "it is worth noting that the concentration of tl in the detectors is about 0.1% .",
    "moreover , the growth with kyropoulos method in platinum crucible with a peculiar devoted protocol acts as a further relevant radiopurification step . obviously , the maximal sensitivity to determine the final residual contaminations is reached when directly measured in the crystals themselves ( see later ) .",
    "in fact , the aas and ms are mainly limited by the radiopurity of the line and by the added materials and  as mentioned ",
    "the used crystallization process itself acts as an additional considerable purification step .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the reachable final levels depend both on the initial impurity concentrations and on the used processes and handling protocols .",
    "particular care has been devoted to the selection of tools and abrasives to be used for cutting and polishing the crystals from the produced large ingots ; this requires , in particular , severe selections and control of tools and of procedures in order to avoid any significant pollution on surface during the operation .",

    "selected tetratec - teflon foils , wrapping the bare cystals , have been used as diffusers of the scintillation light because of their suitable performances and mainly of their radiopurity with respect to other possibilities . for the same reason",
    ", ofhc freshly electrolyzed copper has been used for the housings of the detectors .",
    "preliminary suitable etching of the copper housings has been performed for a deep cleaning of possible residuals from machinery . obviously , the foam ( not distinguishable from outside by eyes ) , usually used inside the housing of standard nai(tl ) detectors for compensation , is not used in the construction of the dama / libra detectors because of the low background requirements . instead , a mechanical compensation for the different specific heats of the cu and nai(tl ) is included in the design of the copper housing to avoid any possible damages during transportation in non - air - conditioned environment before installation deep underground .",
    "many other specific expedients have also been exploited . in particular",
    "we remind that the detectors , built for the dama apparata in gran sasso , have always been cut and assembled just after the growth of the crystalline bulk in a glove - box in controlled atmosphere , tightly sealed according to special requirements , road transported and immediately brought underground .",
    "a preliminary estimate of the residual u and th contamination in a detector can be obtained from the internal @xmath31 particles produced by both chains .",
    "they can be measured by exploiting the @xmath33e pulse shape discrimination in nai(tl ) , which has practically 100% effectiveness in the mev range .",

    "this latter value is well supported by the kev range calibrations , by the features of the near - threshold - noise full rejection procedure and by the efficiencies when lowering the number of available photoelectrons ( see for example fig .",
