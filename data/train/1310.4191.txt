    "although the paradigms of _ self - organized criticality ( soc ) _ systems appear to be very intuitive and self - explaining , such as the self - adjusting angle of repose in per bak s sandpile ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) , or the stick - slip motion of earthquakes ( gutenberg and richer 1949 ) , theoreticians find it hard to establish a rigorous general definition of soc systems .",
    "part of the problem are the subtle differences between `` criticality '' in fine - tuned systems that undergo percolation or phase transitions , such as the ising model ( ising 1925 ) , versus `` self - organized criticality '' systems , which do not need any fine - tuning ( e.g. , christensen and moloney 2005 )",
    ". a solid definition of soc systems should ( i ) be able to make quantitative predictions that are testable by observations , and ( ii ) provide discrimination criteria between soc and alternative transport processes occurring in complex systems ( such as random walk , branching theory , network theory , percolation , aggregation , or turbulence ) .",
    "a mathematical definition of soc includes _",
    "`` non - trivial scale invariance ( with spatio - temporal correlations ) in avalanching ( intermittent ) systems as known from ordinary critical phenomena , but with internal , self - organized rather than external tuning of a control parameter ( to a non - trivial value ) '' _ ( pruessner 2012 ) .",
    "alternatively , we may define soc from a more physical point of view : _ soc is a critical state of a nonlinear energy dissipation system that is slowly and continuously driven towards a critical value of a system - wide instability threshold , producing scale - free , fractal - diffusive , and intermittent avalanches with powerlaw - like size distributions .",
    "_ this definition applies to soc phenomena as diverse as sandpiles , earthquakes , solar flares , or stockmarket fluctuations .",
    "the major problem is that soc is a microscopic process in complex systems , which can not easily be described by macroscopic equations , unlike entropy - related processes in classical thermodynamics . in order to obtain insights into soc processes , microscopic processes in complex systems",
    "have been simulated by iterative numerical codes , such as cellular automaton models , where a single time step is quantified by a mathematical redistribution rule , which operates on a microscopic level .",
    "such soc models are also called _ slowly - driven interaction - dominated threshold ( sdidt ) _ systems , which all share some common properties , such as a large but finite number of degrees of freedom , a threshold for nonlinearity , a re - distribution rule once the local variable exceeds the threshold , and a continuous but slow driver ( jensen 1998 ; p.126 ; pruessner 2012 ; p.7 ) .",
    "such numerical simulations produce powerlaw - like probability distributions of soc parameters , which are generally considered as a necessary ( but not satisfactory ) criterion to identify soc .    in this study",
    "we derive a macroscopic description of soc processes by analytical means , which are supposed to mimic the statistics of microscopic , spatially unresolved , next - neighbor interactions in soc systems .",
    "the situation is similar to classical thermodynamics , where macroscopic parameters such as temperature , pressure , or entropy describe the microscopic state ( e.g. , the boltzmann distribution ) , resulting from atomic collisions and other energy dissipation processes .",
    "the analytical approximation of complex spatial structures is accomplished by the concept of fractals ( i.e. , monofractals or multi - fractals ) .",
    "our analytical framework of soc processes includes geometric , temporal , physical , and observable parameters , for which physical scaling laws exist that determine the spatio - temporal evolution and the statistical distributions .",
    "however , the main difference to classical thermodynamics is the nonlinear nature of complex systems , while thermodynamic systems are governed by incoherent random noise that add up in a linear way .",
    "our analytical description of soc models entails four different aspects : ( 1 ) geometric parameters and geometric scaling laws ; ( 2 ) temporal parameters and spatio - temporal evolution and transport ; ( 3 ) physical scaling laws ; and ( 4 ) instrument - dependent observables .",
    "these four domains are treated separately in the following .",
    "we start with geometric parameters , such as a length scale @xmath0 , an euclidean area @xmath7 , an euclidean volume @xmath8 , embedded in a euclidean space with a dimension of @xmath91 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "euclidean means space - filling here , while inhomogeneous structures are described by a fractal dimension @xmath10 , which also depends on the euclidean dimension @xmath6 .",
    "soc phenomena ( like avalanches on a sandpile ) can be triggered by the infall of a single sand grain , and thus the causal consequence of a tiny input or disturbance can have an unpredictable magnitude of the outcome or nonlinear response of a soc system .",
    "henceforth , the geometric size of a soc avalanche can cover a considerable range @xmath11 from the size @xmath12 of a single sand grain to the finite size @xmath13 of the soc system . if only next - neighbor interactions are allowed in a soc system , such as in the bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) model ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) , a continuous distribution of length scales @xmath0 of avalanches is expected when averaged over a long time .",
    "naturally , small avalanches have a higher probability to occur than large ones , because they can happen simultaneously at different places of a sandpile , while a large system - wide avalanche can occur only once at a time .",
    "so , we can ask the question about the _ probability distribution function ( pdf ) _",
    ", @xmath14 , of avalanches with size @xmath0 to occur in a soc system .",
    "in order to solve this problem , we proceed in the same way as the pdf of random processes is derived .",
    "the simplest statistical distribution is obtained from rolling dice , by enumerating all possible outcomes .",
    "the pdf of outcomes of rolling one dice , two dice , and three dice is shown in fig .  1 , the classical binomial distribution that approaches a gaussian normal distribution ( fig",
    ".  1 ) for a large number of dice , with possible outcomes of @xmath15 for 6-sided dice , while the pdf @xmath16 is a gaussian function centered at @xmath17 .",
    "going to the statistical probability distributions of avalanches with size @xmath0 , we use the same method by enumerating all possible states with size @xmath0 that can occur in a soc system with finite size @xmath13 . the case with an euclidean space dimension of @xmath18",
    "is illustrated in fig .  2 , where we use logarithmic bins with size @xmath19 .",
    "in a system with finite size @xmath20 , one avalanche of this maximum size @xmath13 is possible in a given time interval , and thus @xmath21 . for a bin with half the size ,",
    "@xmath22 we have four possible areas with a length scale of @xmath23 , and thus @xmath24 .",
    "proceeding to quarter bins , @xmath25 , we have 16 possible areas with size @xmath25 , and thus @xmath26 , and so forth .",
    "obviously , the probability distribution scales as @xmath27 for euclidean dimension @xmath18 .",
    "we can easily imagine the probabilities for the other euclidean dimensions @xmath28 , which is @xmath29 , and for @xmath30 , which is @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we obtain a generalized probability distribution of length scales @xmath0 according to @xmath32 which we call the _ scale - free probability conjecture _ ( aschwanden 2012a ) , being related to _ packing rules _",
    "( e.g. , sphere packing , or dense packing ) in geometric aggregation problems . a similar approach of using geometric scaling laws was also pioneered for earthquakes ( main and burton 1984 ) . the term _ scale - free _ is generally used to express that no special scale is present in a statistical distribution , unlike the first moment or center value of a gaussian ( normal ) distribution , or the e - folding value in an exponential distribution .",
    "our scale - free probability does not require that all possible avalanches in a soc system have to occur simultaneously , or in any particular sequential order .",
    "they just represent the expected distribution of a statistically representative sample , similar to the rolling of dice .",
    "for instance , using @xmath33 dice to mimic the number of atoms per @xmath34 , there is no way to execute all possible rolls , but we expect for any statistically representative subset of possible outcomes a gaussian distribution .",
    "similarly , we expect a length distribution @xmath35 according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) for any statistically representative subset of avalanches occurring in a soc system .",
    "we expect that eq .",
    "( 1 ) has universal validity in soc systems , because it is only based on a statistical argument of random processes on all scales , without any other constraints given by specific physical parameters or the dynamic behavior of a soc system . this scale - free probability conjecture ( eq .",
    "1 ) may also occur in other nonlinear systems , such as in turbulence .",
    "we may be able to discriminate between the two systems by the sparseness of avalanches ( in slowly - driven soc systems ) and the space - filling of structures ( in turbulent media ) .      in the following we are going to derive size distributions of soc avalanches by using geometric scaling laws , which is a standard approach that has been applied in a number of previous work ( e.g. , bak et al .  1988 ; robinson 1994 ; munoz et al .",
    "1999 ; biham et al .",
    "2001 ) .    besides the length scale @xmath0 ,",
    "other geometric parameters are the euclidean area @xmath7 or the euclidean volume @xmath8 .",
    "the simplest definition of an area @xmath7 as a function of a length scale @xmath0 is the square - dependence , @xmath36 which applies also to circular areas , @xmath37 , or more complicated solid areas , differing only by a constant factor for self - similar geometric shapes .",
    "a direct consequence of this simple geometric scaling law is that the statistical probability distribution of avalanche areas is directly coupled to the scale - free probability distribution of length scales ( eq .  1 ) , and can be computed by substitution of @xmath38 ( eq .",
    "2 ) , into the distribution of eq .

    ", we can derive the geometric scaling for volumes @xmath8 , which simply scales with the cubic power in 3d space , @xmath45 which represents a cube , but differs only by a constant factor for a sphere , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , we can also derive the probability distribution @xmath47 of volumes @xmath8 directly from the scale - free probability conjecture ( eq .  1 ) ,",

    "however , since avalanches have a fractal geometry , it is the time - integrated fractal volume that is equivalent to the number of active pixels in a lattice simulation , rather than the euclidean volume .    since all the assumptions made so far are universal , such as the scale - free probability conjecture ( eq .  1 ) and the geometric scaling laws @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the resulting predicted occurrence frequency distributions of @xmath42 ( eq .",
    "3 ) and @xmath55 ( eq .  6 ) are universal too , and powerlaw functions are predicted from this derivation from first principles , which is consistent with the property of _ universality _ in theoretical soc definitions .",
    "_ `` fractals in nature originate from self - organized critical dynamical processes '' _",
    "( bak and chen 1989 ) .",
    "fractal geometries have been pioneered in the context of self - similar structures before the advent of soc models ( mandelbrot 1977 , 1983 , 1985 ) , and have been applied to spatio - temporal soc structures extensively ( e.g. , bak et al .",

    "since the fractal geometry is a postulate of soc processes invoked by the first pioneers of soc , it is appropriate to approximate spatial structures of soc avalanches by a fractal dimension .",

    "the hausdorff dimension @xmath57 for the 3d euclidean space ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath58 and analogously for the 2d euclidean space ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the fractal area and volume of a soc avalanche during an instant of time @xmath62 .",
    "these fractal dimensions can be determined by a box - counting method , where the area fractal @xmath63 can readily be obtained from images from the real world , while the volume fractal @xmath57 is generally not available unless one obtains 3d data ( or by numerical simulations ) .    a good approximation for the expected fractal dimension @xmath10 is the mean value of the smallest possible fractal dimension @xmath64 and the largest possible fractal dimension @xmath65 .",
    "the minimum possible fractal dimension is near the value of 1 because the next - neighbour interactions in soc avalanches require some continuity between active nodes in a lattice simulation of a cellular automaton , while smaller fractal dimensions @xmath66 are too sparse to allow an avalanche to propagate via next - neighbor interactions .",
    "thus , the mean value of a fractal dimension is expected to be ( aschwanden 2012a ) , @xmath67 thus , we expect fractal dimensions of @xmath68 for the 3d space , and @xmath69 for the 2d space .",

    "from this time - dependent evolution of a soc avalanche we can characterize at the end time @xmath62 a time duration @xmath91 , a spatial scale @xmath111 , an expected flux or energy dissipation rate @xmath112 , an expected peak flux or peak energy dissipation rate @xmath113 , and a dissipated energy @xmath114 , which is proportional to the avalanche size @xmath115 in btw models .",

    "for instance , the strength of an earthquake is measured in magnitudes of the gutenberg - richter scale ( richter 1958 ) , which may be related to the observed earthquake rupture area by some mechanical scaling law that determines the statistics ( main and burton 1984 ) . for solar flares , the observed fluxes in soft or hard x - rays are related to the physical parameters of electron temperatures , densities , and pressures of heated plasma , as it can be derived for the equilibrium point between heating and cooling ( e.g. , rosner et al .  1978 ) .",
    "other scaling laws used in solar physics include , for instance , relationships between magnetic energies and the reduced mhd equations ( longcope and sudan 1992 ) , or the magnetic reconnection geometry ( craig 2001 ) , or between the heating rate and the magnetic field strength ( schrijver et al .",
    "such physical scaling laws allow us to derive the powerlaw slope of the frequency distribution of both the observables and the physical parameters , which is examined elsewhere ( e.g. , aschwanden et al .  2013 ) .",

    ", we can give some general rules how to derive the powerlaw function of physical parameters .",
    "the simplest situation is a 2-parameter correlation or scaling law , where a physical parameter @xmath133 is related to the geometric length scale by a powerlaw function with index @xmath174 , @xmath175 inserting this scaling law into the fundamental length scale distribution @xmath98 ( eq .  1 ) and using the derivative @xmath176 yields then directly the occurrence frequency distribution @xmath132 , @xmath177 ) { dl \\over dx } dx = x^{-[1+(d-1)\\gamma ] } dx \\ .\\ ] ] also common is a 3-parameter correlation or scaling law , such as in terms of two physical parameters @xmath133 and @xmath178 and the length scale @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath179 in terms of powerlaw functions with exponents @xmath174 and @xmath180 .",
    "the probability distribution for one of the physical parameters , say @xmath178 , can then be written as , @xmath181 ) dl \\",
    "dy          = \\int n(l ) n(x[l , y ] ) dl \\",
    "dy          \\propto y^{a_x \\delta / \\gamma } \\ dy \\ , \\ ] ] after the integration over the variable @xmath0 is carried out .",
    "thus the resulting distribution @xmath182 has a powerlaw slope of @xmath183 .",
    "the powerlaw solution is strictly valid only for complete sampling of the parameters , which in reality is often not possible due to limited statistics , instrumental sensitivity limits , and data noise .",
    "this leads to truncation effects and finite - size effects , which can be simulated with monte - carlo simulations or analytically calculated ( see appendix in aschwanden et al .",
    "2013 for examples ) .      besides physical scaling laws that are specific to a particular physical mechanism of a soc system , there are also instrument - dependent scaling laws that are not universal and",
    "depend on the specific instrument used in an observation of soc phenomena .",
    "if there is a nonlinear scaling between the observable and the geometric volume of a soc avalanche , we can not expect to measure the same powerlaw slope of an observable with different instruments . in order to make observed frequency distributions obtained with different instruments compatible , it is often advisable to reduce the observable parameters to physical parameters using a well - established instrument calibration . for astrophysical observations in soft x - rays and euv , for instance ,",
    "an instrument - independent physical quantity is the differential emission measure distribution , which can be inverted from observed fluxes in different wavelengths ( e.g. , aschwanden et al .",
    "after we have described a general macroscopic model of a soc system that predicts the occurrence frequency distributions of spatial , temporal , and volume - related observables , such as the flux and energy , we turn now to theoretical and numerical soc models and discuss whether our macroscopic model meets the basic definitions of a soc system .",
    "a comprehensive review of theoretical and numerical soc models is given in the textbook by pruessner ( 2012 ) . while a strict definition of soc systems is still not well - established , we will use here the working definition given in the introduction : _ soc is a critical state of a nonlinear energy dissipation system that is slowly and continuously driven towards a critical value of a system - wide instability threshold , producing scale - free , fractal - diffusive , and intermittent avalanches with powerlaw - like size distributions .",
    "_ the property of self - tuning to criticality is warranted by system - inherent physical conditions that define a system - wide instability threshold .",
    "this system - inherent physical condition is often given by the equilibrium solution between two competing forces .",
    "for instance , the angle of repose in a sandpile is self - tuning to a system - wide critical value , corresponding to an equilibrium point between the gravity force and the static friction force . in the ising model ( ising 1925 )",
    ", a phase transition occurs at a critical point between an ordered and a disordered magnetic spin state , but the tuning to the critical point is not self - organized . in the following we discuss how the macroscopic soc model ( section 2 ) relates to the microscopic ( mathematical and numerical ) soc models , regarding powerlw - scaling ( section 3.1 ) , spatio - temporal correlations ( section 3.2 ) , separation of time scales and intermittency ( section 3.3 ) , and self - tuning and critical threshold ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "the original bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) model revealed the generic scale invariance of simulated or observed soc parameters , which ideally exhibits powerlaw functions for the occurrence frequency distributions , possibly related to the 1/f - noise of power spectra ( bak et al .",
    "the property of a powerlaw shape became the hallmark of soc phenomena , but it was recognized that this is a necessary but not a satisfactory condition , since other phenomena ( such as turbulence or percolation ) produce powerlaws also .",
    "our fractal - diffusive soc model ( fd - soc ) derives the probability distribution functions ( pfd ) based on a statistical probability argument , which leads to a powerlaw function of spatial and geometric scales .",
    "the additional assumption of fractal - diffusive transport leads to a powerlaw function of temporal scales .",
    "further we define the size of an avalanche from the time - integrated fractal volume that participates in an avalanche , and consequently we obtain also powerlaw distributions for the size or total dissipated energy of avalanches . since all these assumptions are of statistical nature and do not depend on any physical parameters of a soc system , the predictions of the pdfs of spatial , temporal , and energy soc parameters have universal applicability , irregardless of the physical process that is involved in the nonlinear energy dissipation process . the prediction of a pure powerlaw function for the size distributions at all scales is also called _ universality _ in theoretical soc models ( e.g. sethna et al .",
    "2001 ) , and is fulfilled in the macroscopic description of our fd - soc model by design ( as a consequence of the scale - free probability conjecture ; eq .  1 )",
    "however , we should be aware that this simple fd - soc model provides only a first - order prediction , while additional effects ( such as truncation , incomplete sampling , or finite - size effects ) may modify the observed size distributions into broken powerlaws , double powerlaws , or other powerlaw - like distribution functions . however , similar effects occur also in cellular automaton simulations .",
    "soc systems are expected to exhibit spatio - temporal correlations ( jensen 1998 ) of a soc state variable @xmath184 , @xmath185 such correlations are absent in systems with random noise . in our fd - soc model , however , the random structure of the background in a state near criticality is episodically disturbed by an avalanche event , which carves out a `` hole '' with a size @xmath0 during a time scale @xmath1 , which represents a major disturbance in form of a spatially and temporally coherent structure , which can be restored to the critical state only gradually , for slowly - driven soc systems . naturally , large avalanches leave their footprints behind and produce spatio - temporal correlations during the local restoration time .",
    "the correlation is best for large avalanches with similar shapes .",
    "the time profiles of avalanches in our fd - soc system are self - similar to some extent , since they are characterized by a common fractal dimension @xmath10 ( eq .  15 ) , diffusion constant @xmath81 , and diffusive spreading exponent @xmath82 ( eq .  11 ) .",
    "we visualize the spatial correlations with a cartoon in fig .  6 , which shows coherent disturbances as deviations from the critical state in large avalanches occurring in sandpiles and in solar flares .    in our two - component model of waiting times ( section 2.6 ) , an observed time series consist of quiet intervals @xmath186 with no avalanching ( which have a random distribution ) , and active intervals with contiguous flaring ( which have a powerlaw distribution like the event durations @xmath187 ) .",
    "this dual behavior is also called _ intermittency _ , and has the consequence that the combined waiting time distribution has both a powerlaw range ( @xmath188 ) and an exponential cutoff ( @xmath189 ) . consequently , we expect spatio - temporal correlations ( eq .",
    "38 ) during the intermittently active periods only , while they are expected to be absent during the quiet time intervals .",
    "avalanching during active periods is also expected to exhibit persistence and memory , while no memory is expected during quiet time intervals .",
    "this property seems to be more consistent with observations ( e.g. , telloni et al .",
    "2014 ) , but is different from the pure random ( poisson ) statistics of the original btw model , but reconciles related debates about the functional shape of the waiting time distributions ( e.g. , boffetta et al .",
    "1999 ; lepreti et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "classical soc systems operate in the limit of slow driving , which implies a separation between the duration of an avalanche and the waiting time interval between two subsequent avalanches .",
    "numerically , the separation of time scales is simply realized by allowing only one single disturbance of a soc system at a time , which triggers an avalanche ( with duration @xmath1 ) or not , while the next disturbance is not initiated after a waiting time @xmath190 , in the case of an avalanche .",
    "in our fd - soc model , the energy dissipation rate @xmath191 is monotonically growing after a triggering disturbance , which exceeds the system - wide threshold value @xmath192 until the spatial diffusion stops after time @xmath1 , due to a lack of unstable nodes among the next - neighbors of an instantaneous avalanche area or volume .",
    "therefore , the energy dissipation rate during an avalanche exceeds the threshold value during the entire duration of an avalanche .",
    "energy conservation between the slowly - driven energy input rate and the intermittent avalanching output rate can therefore only be obtained with sufficiently long waiting times @xmath2 during which the energy loss of an avalanche is restored .",
    "this requires a balance of the long - term averages of the energy input and output rates , i.e. , @xmath193 since @xmath194 , it follows that @xmath195 , which warrants a separation of the time scales , i.e. , the waiting time @xmath2 and the avalanche duration @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting time profile of the energy dissipation rate @xmath191 of a soc system is then necessarily highly intermittent due to the long waiting times inbetween subsequent avalanches .",
    "in addition , the time profile is strongly fluctuating during an avalanche , according to @xmath196 ( eq .  15 ) , since the fractal dimension @xmath197 can fluctuate in the entire range between the minimum and maximum value as a function of time , i.e. , @xmath198 .",
    "for the scaling laws in the fd - soc model ( eqs .  18 - 20 ) , we can replace the fluctuating value of @xmath197 with a constant mean value @xmath199 and obtain the same size distributions .",
    "how does our fractal - diffusive soc model reinforce self - organized criticality ?",
    "in classical soc models , criticality is obtained by a slowly - driven input of energy which restores the energy losses of avalanches until the system - wide critical threshold is reached ( more or less ) and new avalanches can be triggered by a local excess of the critical threshold . in our fd - soc model , the time evolution of an avalanche has a generic shape that is given by fractal - diffusive transport , while the energy balance between energy input ( disturbances ) and output ( avalanches ) is not explicitly reinforced , unlike cellular automaton models which iterate a mathematical redistribution rule to drive the dynamics of a soc system and are designed to conserve energy . instead",
    ", self - organization of the fd - soc model is constrained by statistical probability only , which does not need to be self - tuning to produce a particular functional form of a size distribution , because there is only one statistical distribution with maximum likelyhood , which is a powerlaw distribution function of spatial scales ( according to our scale - free probability conjecture ) .",
    "so , we can say that the fd - soc model gravitates around the statistically most likely state , like entropy in self - contained statistical systems without external influence .",
    "this may be a more general definition of self - organized criticality then originally proposed by per bak and coworkers , but explains the concept of self - organization by the most general principle of maximum statistical likelyhood .",
    "this should not surprise us , since the entire evolution of our universe followed maximum statistical likelihood , from the initial big bang expansion all the way to the bio - chemical evolution of life , forming complexity out of simple structures based on processes that are driven by statistical likelyhood ( e.g. , mendel s law in genetics ) .",
    "in this section we examine frequency distributions observed in various realms of astrophysics and discuss the application of the fractal - diffusive soc model in a few selected datasets with large statistics .",
    "some preliminary discussion of such astrophysical objects can also be found in aschwanden ( 2011a ; chapters 7 and 8) and in aschwanden ( 2013 ; chapter 13 ) .",
    "an overview of astrophysical phenomena with observed powerlaw indices of size distributions is given in table 1 .",
    "if we mount a large container with a gel - like surface below a circular plate that holds per bak s sandpile , we would record impact craters from each sandpile avalanche in the viscous gel and could infer the avalanche sizes from the diameters of the impact craters ( see experimental setup of sandpile experiment conducted by held et al .",
    "similarly , the moon was targeted by many impacting meteors and meteorites , especially during an intense bombardment in the final sweep - up of debris at the end of the formation of the solar system between 4.6 and 4.0 billion years ago ( e.g. , neukum et al .",
    "the sizes of lunar craters were measured with the first lunar orbiters ( ranger 7 , 8 , 9 ) in the early 1960 s , and a cumulative powerlaw distribution with sizes in the range of @xmath200 cm was found , with a powerlaw slope of @xmath201 for the cumulative distribution ( cross 1966 ) , which corresponds to a value of @xmath202 for the differential size distribution .",
    "this quite accurate result ( for a size distribution covering a range of over 4 orders of magnitude ) corresponds exactly to our prediction of the scale - free probability conjecture , @xmath203 ( eq .  1 ) .",
    "a similar value of @xmath204 was found for the size distribution of meteorites and space debris from man - made rockets and satellites ( fig .  3.11 in sornette 2004 ) .",
    "the formation of the sizes of meteors and meteorites may have been controlled by a nonlinear process that includes a combination of self - gravity , gravitational disturbances , collisions , depletions , fragmentation , and captures of incoming new bodies in the solar system ( e.g. , ivanov 2001 ) .",
    "the moon acts as a target that records the sizes of impacting meteorites that were produced by a soc process , similar to the gel - filled plate under bak s sandpile .",
    "the origin of the asteroid main belt is believed to be associated with a time period of intense collisional evolution shortly after the formation of the planets ( e.g. , botke et al .",
    "the asteroids are a leftover of the planetesimals that were either too small to form a planet by self - gravitation , or they orbited in an unstable region of the solar system that constantly got disturbed by the largest planets jupiter and saturn .    in table 1",
    "we compile some values of measured size distributions of asteroids , given as powerlaw slopes @xmath205 of the differential size distributions ( related to the slope @xmath206 of the cumulative size distribution by @xmath207 , which includes values in the range of @xmath208 , obtained from the palomar leiden survey ( van houten et al .  1970 ) , the spacewatch surveys ( jedicke and metcalfe 1998 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( ivezic et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the subaru main - belt asteroid survey ( yoshida et al .  2003",
    "; yoshida and nakamura 2007 ) .",
    "these values of the powerlaw slopes agree within @xmath209 with our theoretical prediction of @xmath210 , but the statistical range of sizes covers less than two decades , and thus incomplete sampling of small sizes is likely to limit the accuracy .",
    "the saturn ring extends over a range of 7,000 - 80,000 km above saturn s equator and has a mass of @xmath211 kg , consisting of myriads of small particles with sizes in the range from 1 mm to 20 m ( zebker et al .",
    "1985 ; french and nicholson 2000 ) .",
    "the particle size distribution was measured in eight different ring regions with _",
    "voyager i _ radio occultation measurements ( zebker et al .",
    "these size distributions were found to have slightly different powerlaw slopes in each ring zone , with values of @xmath212 for ring a , @xmath213 for the cassini division , and @xmath214 for ring c ( zebker et al .",
    "1985 ) . averaging the values from all eight zones we find @xmath215 , which is remarkably close to the prediction @xmath210 of the scale - free probability conjecture ( eq .  1 )",
    "thus , the fragmentation of saturn ring particles is consistent with the statistics of soc avalanches , and the process of collisional fragmentation driven by celestial mechanics can be considered as a self - organizing system that is constantly driven towards the collisional instability threshold .",
    "an instability occurs by a collision of particles .",
    "if the system has a too low density , no collisions occur and the system is subcritical , while a too high density of particles would result into an excessive collision rate that would destroy the structure of the saturn ring .",
    "hence , the long - lived saturn ring can be considered as a soc system that self - tunes to a critical collisional limit that maintains its shape and conserves its ( kinetic ) energy , similar to bak s soc sandpile that maintains its slope and conserves the potential energy .      the earth s magnetosphere displays a number of phenomena that have been associated with soc models ( table 1 ) , such as active and quiet substorms and auroral events ( lui et al .",

    "the earlier reported lower values for the powerlaw slopes of auroral fluences ( lui et al .",
    "2000 ) are incompatible with recent observational results as well as with the fd - soc model , because the auroral sizes were measured from snapshots taken in regular time intervals , rather than measured individually for each avalanche event ( udritsky et al .",
    "this case with contradicting statistical results measured from the same data is an example of a validation test with the fd - soc model .    the number of electrons in the outer radiation belt ( at @xmath224 l - shell distances ) is modulated by the solar wind , exhibiting size distributions of electron peak fluxes with powerlaw slopes of @xmath225 ( crosby et al .",
    "the variation of the powerlaw slope is mostly attributed to variations of the orbits of the microsatellites ( strv-1a and 1b ) that record the electron bursts at different intersections of the radiation belt with the orbits .",
    "nevertheless , the mean value averaged over different years and l - shell distances , @xmath226 , is quite consistent with the theoretical prediction @xmath227 of the fd - soc model .",
    "the radiation belt can be considered as a soc system , where the input is driven by solar wind electrons , which become trapped in the outer radiation belt , while magnetic variations modulate the untrapping of electrons by a self - organizing loss - cone angle , producing avalanches of electrons bursts .",
    "solar flares have been interpreted as a soc phenomenon since 1991 ( lu and hamilton 1991 ) and numerous studies have been performed to establish the size distributions of various solar flare parameters measured in hard x - rays ( hxr ) , soft x - rays ( sxr ) , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) , and radio wavelengths . a representative selection of powerlaw slopes from size distributions of solar flare length scales ( @xmath205 ) , flare areas ( @xmath228 ) , time durations ( @xmath229 ) , peak fluxes ( @xmath230 ) , and fluences or energies ( @xmath231 ) is given in table 1 ( see references in footnote of table 1 ) .",

    "the remaining differences can be attributed to the different instrumental bias and the different analysis methods ( threshold definition , preflare background subtraction , temperature bias ) of the observations .",
    "also the peak fluxes observed in radio wavelengths are commensurable with the predictions for incoherent emission mechanisms , such as gyrosynchrotron emission in microwave bursts .",
    "only the solar energetic particles appear to have a flatter distribution than predicted , which has been interpreted in terms of a selection bias for large events ( cliver et al .",
    "2012 ) , or alternatively in terms of the geometric dimensionality of the soc system ( kahler 2013 ) . in summary , except for the sep events , solar flares observed in almost all wavelengths are in agreement with the fd - soc model and provide the strongest support for soc models among all astrophysical phenomena .    what are the physical mechanisms in a soc system that produce solar flares",
    "the solar corona is considered to be a multi - component soc system , where each active region or quiet sun region represents a different soc sandpile , with its own spatial ( finite - size ) boundary , lifetime , and flaring rate .",
    "interestingly , the statistics of a single soc system ( one active region ) seems not to be significantly different from the statistics of an ensemble of soc systems ( in the entire corona ) , except for a different largest - event cutoff ( kucera et al .",
    "the energy input comes ultimately from build - up of nonpotential magnetic fields ( with electric currents ) that is driven by subphotospheric magneto - convection and magnetic flux emergence .",
    "the coronal soc system is slowly driven by continuous emergence of magnetic flux , braiding , and stressing of the magnetic field . once a local threshold for instability is exceeded ( kink instability , torus instability , tearing mode instability , etc . ) , an avalanche of magnetic energy dissipation is triggered that ends in a fractal - diffusive phase .",
    "the dissipated energy can be converted into thermal energy of heated plasma ( visible in soft x - rays and euv ) , and into kinetic energy of accelerated particles ( detectable in hard x - rays and in gyrosynchrotron emission in radio wavelengths ) .",

    "such a steep slope can only be produced by an extremely weak dependence of the x - ray peak flux @xmath131 on the avalanche volume @xmath8 , requiring a quenching mechanism that limits every fluctuation to almost the same level .",
    "the cellular automaton model of mineshige and negoro ( 1999 ) , which can produce powerlaw size distributions with such steep slopes of @xmath260 , indeed prescribes a non - random distribution of time scales for large pulses ( shots ) , where the occurrence of large pulses is suppressed for a certain period after each large pulse .",
    "blazars ( bl lacertae objects ) are high - polarization quasars and optically violent variable stars , which exhibit a high degree of fluctuation in radio and x - ray emission due to their particular orientation with the jet axis almost coaligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "light curves from gx 0109 + 224 were analyzed and found to exhibit a 1/f noise spectrum , i.e. , @xmath261 with @xmath262 , and a size distribution of peak fluxes with a powerlaw slope of @xmath263 , and have been interpreted in terms of a soc model ( ciprini et al .",
    "this value is quite consistent with the prediction of our standard fd - soc model ( @xmath227 ) , which suggests that the peak flux @xmath131 emitted ( in optical and radio wavelengths ) is proportional to the emitting volume @xmath8 .",
    "the agreement between observations and the theoretical prediction supports the universal applicability of the fd - soc model .",
    "cosmic rays are high - energetic particles that propagate through a large part of our universe and are accelerated by galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields . cosmic ray energy spectra span over a huge range of @xmath264 ev , where the lower limit of @xmath265 gev corresponds to the largest energies that can be accelerated in solar flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "this cosmic ray energy spectrum exhibits an approximate powerlaw function with a mean slope of @xmath266 ( fig .  8 , bottom right ) .",
    "a more detailed inspection reveals actually a broken powerlaw with a slope of @xmath267 below the knee at @xmath268 ev , and a slope of @xmath269 above the knee .",
    "the two energy regimes are associated with the particle origin in galactic space ( @xmath270 ) and extragalactic space ( @xmath271 .",
    "if we interpret a cosmic - ray energy spectrum as a size distribution of particle energies , we can apply our universal soc model .",
    "the driver of the soc system is a generation mechanism of seed populations of charged particles , which are mostly bound to astrophysical objects in a collisional plasma .",
    "a critical threshold is given by transitions of the particles from collisional to collisionless plamsa ( such as in the `` run - away regime '' ) , where a particle can freely be accelerated , either by fermi first - order or diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the subsequent particle transport combined with numerous acceleration steps during every passage of suitable electric fields or shock fronts represents the build - up of an avalanche , until the particle hits the earth s upper atmosphere where it is detected by a shower of secondary particles .",
    "if we could observe all end products of an avalanche , we would expect an energy spectrum of @xmath223 . in reality , the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is @xmath272 , assuming that the detected energies are proportional to the avalanche volume .",
    "how can we explain this discrepancy ?",
    "a powerlaw index of this value is expected for the size distribution of length scales , @xmath203 ( eq .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , a similar energy spectrum of @xmath273 can only be produced if the energy @xmath4 is proportional to the length scale @xmath0 , requiring that the fractal volume @xmath274 has a fractal dimension of @xmath275 .",
    "such a scaling can be arranged if only a linear subvolume of an entire 3d avalanche is observed , which is indeed the case for in - situ detection at earth , since the origin of the cosmic ray avalanche is located far away .",
    "the situation is visualized in fig .",
    "8 . in solar flares , on the other hand",
    ", almost all energetic particles accelerated during a flare lose their energy in the chromosphere , and thus we can detect the entire energy content of an avalanche event by remote - sensing .",
    "this is not possible in cosmic rays , because we can not detect in - situ all energy losses of cosmic ray particles that originated isotropically from the same avalanche , in a remote place such as in a supernova or black hole .",
    "another aspect that our fd - soc model predicts is the random walk diffusion during its propagation , which is consistent with the current thinking of cosmic ray particle transport .    adopting the resulting scaling law between the energy @xmath4 of a cosmic ray particle and the euclidian length scale @xmath0 that a cosmic ray particle has traveled at the time of detection , @xmath276 , which is expected for direct electric field acceleration in a voltage drop , as well as for any other particle acceleration mechanism with a fixed amount of energy extraction per distance increase , @xmath277",
    ", we can even determine the distance to the origination site of the cosmic ray particle . the cosmic ray spectrum shown in fig .",
    "8 has a knee at @xmath278 ev , which marks the distance of the earth to the center of our galaxy @xmath279 light years or @xmath280 cm ) .",
    "the euclidean distance where a cosmic ray particle with a maximum energy of @xmath281 erg originated is then , @xmath282 which yields @xmath283 cm , which corresponds to about 10% of the size of our universe ( @xmath284 cm ) .",
    "since the intergalactic and extragalactic magnetic fields have different field strengths , the diffusion coefficient of cosmic ray particles is also expected to be different in these two regimes , which may explain the slightly different powerlaw slopes below and above the galactic boundary @xmath285 and the related energy @xmath286 .",
    "the lowest energies of the cosmic ray spectrum are at @xmath287 ev . using the same linear scaling of energy with length scale , @xmath288 we estimate a distance of @xmath289 cm or 200 au , which is located somewhat outside of the termination shock of our heliosphere .",
    "in this paper we developed a macroscopic description of soc systems that is designed to reproduce the same statistical distributions of observables as from soc processes occurring on a microscopic level and observed in nature .",
    "the microscopic processes can not be treated analytically due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the nonlinear nature of the dynamic soc systems .",
    "the complexity of the microscopic fine structure during soc avalanches is captured here in a approximative form by three simple parameters : the fractal dimension @xmath10 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath81 , and the diffusive spreading exponent @xmath82 .",
    "what is common to all soc processes is a system - wide critical threshold level that determines whether `` avalanching '' occurs or not . for an overview we list the physical mechanisms that operate in soc systems in table 2 , containing a few classical soc systems , as well as astrophysical applications that we described in this paper .",
    "we are aware that we use the term `` self - organized criticality '' in a more general sense than originally envisioned , in the spirit of the definition given in the introduction : _ soc is a critical state of a nonlinear energy dissipation system that is slowly and continuously driven towards a critical value of a system - wide instability threshold , producing scale - free , fractal - diffusive , and intermittent avalanches with powerlaw - like size distributions . _    let us discuss the meaning of self - organizing criticality in astrophysical applications in some more detail .",
    "essentially we have three aspects of a soc system : ( 1 ) the energy input of the slow and steady driver , ( 2 ) the self - organizing criticality condition or instability threshold , and ( 3 ) the energy output in form of intermittent avalanches ( table 2 ) .",
    "the driver is necessary to keep a soc process going , because the soc process would stop otherwise as soon as the system becomes subcritical .",
    "the instability threshold @xmath290 represents a bifurcation of two possible dynamic outcomes : either nothing happens when the state in every node of a soc system is below this critical threshold ( @xmath291 ) , while an avalanche or nonlinear energy dissipation event is triggered when a threshold exceeds at some location ( @xmath292 ) . in classical soc systems ,",
    "the self - organizing threshold can be a critical slope or angle of repose ( sandpile ) , a phase transition point ( superconductor , ising model , tea kettle ) , a fire ignition threshold ( forest fires ) , or dynamic friction ( earthquakes ) .",
    "in astrophysical systems , the instability thresholds or critical values are equally diverse , such as thresholds for magnetic instability with subsequent magnetic reconnection ( magnetospheric substorms , solar flares , stellar flares ) , magnetic stressing ( neutron star quakes , accretion disk flares ) , particle acceleration thresholds , such as the `` run - away regime '' ( solar energetic particles , cosmic rays ) , vortex unpinning ( neutron stars ) , critical mass density for accretion ( planetesimals , asteroids , accretion disk flares , black - hole objects ) , gravitational disturbances and unstable orbits that trigger collisions ( saturn ring particles , lunar craters ) , etc .",
    "all these instability thresholds have system - wide critical values , so that nothing happens below those values , while avalanching happens above their value .",
    "since these instability thresholds or critical values occur system - wide , set by physical conditions of the internal microscopic processes , the system is self - organizing or self - tuning in the sense that it maintains the same critical values throughout the system .",
    "this follows the basic philosophy of bak s sandpile , where a critical slope is maintained system - wide , internally given by the critical value where the gravitational and the dynamic friction forces are matching . for magnetic reconnection processes , for instance , critical values are given by the kink - instability criterion or by the torus instability criterion .",
    "for the formation of planetesimals ( as well as for the formation of planets and stars ) , a critical mass density is required where accretion by self - gravity overcomes diffusion .",
    "thus , all these astrophysical processes fulfill the basic requirement of our soc definition , i.e. , these nonlinear systems are slowly driven towards a critical value of a system - wide instability threshold . and all of these astrophysical processes exhibit scale - free , fractal - diffuse , and intermittent avalanches , with powerlaw - like size distributions .",
    "we can summarize the conclusions of this study as follows :    1 .",
    "we propose the following general definition of a soc system : _ soc is a critical state of a nonlinear energy dissipation system that is slowly and continuously driven towards a critical value of a system - wide instability threshold , producing scale - free , fractal - diffusive , and intermittent avalanches with powerlaw - like size distributions .",
    "_ this generalized definition expands the original meaning of self - tuning `` criticality '' to a wider class of critical points and instability thresholds that have a similar ( nonlinear ) dynamical behavior and produce similar ( powerlaw - like ) statistical size distributions .",
    "a macroscopic description of soc systems has been derived from first principles that predicts powerlaw functions for the size distributions of soc parameters , as well as universal values of the powerlaw slopes , for geometric and temporal parameters , and some observables ( flux and energy if they are proportional to the emitting fractal volume ) .",
    "this macroscopic soc model exhibits powerlaw scaling , universality , spatio - temporal correlations , separation of time scales , fractality , and intermittency .",
    "the predicted powerlaw slopes depend only on three parameters : on the euclidean dimension @xmath6 of the system , the fractal dimension @xmath10 , and the diffusive spreading exponent @xmath82 .",
    "note , that the spreading exponent is an adjustable parameter in the fd - soc model and can accomodate classical diffusion , sub - diffusive , or hyper - diffusive transport , and thus represents in some sense an ordering parameter , while it can not be adjusted in a branching process or in a btw model with a given re - distribution rule .",
    "the fd - soc model makes the following predictions : for the case of 3d space ( @xmath30 ) and classical diffusion ( @xmath85 ) , the predicted values for the average fractal dimension is @xmath293 , the powerlaw slopes are @xmath294 for length scales , @xmath146 for time scales , @xmath295 for fluxes or energy dissipation rates , @xmath296 for peak fluxes or peak energy dissipation rates , and @xmath297 for fluences ( i.e. , time - integrated fluxes ) or ( total ) avalanche energies , assuming proportionality between the time - integrated fractal avalanche volume and the observed fluence .",
    "4 .   among the astrophysical applications we find agreement between the predicted and observed size distributions for the following phenomena : lunar craters , asteroid belts , saturn ring particles , auroral events during magnetospheric substorms , outer radiation belt electron bursts , solar flares , soft gamma - ray repeaters , and blazars .",
    "this agreement between theory and observations supports the universal applicability of the fractal - diffusive soc model .",
    "discrepancies between the predicted and observed size distributions are found for stellar flares , pulsar glitches , black holes , and cosmic rays , but some can be reconciled with modified soc models .",
    "the disagreement for solar energetic particle ( sep ) events is believed to be due to a selection bias for large events . for stellar flares",
    "we conclude that the bolometric fluence is not proportional to the dissipated energy and volume .",
    "pulsar glitches are subject to small - number statistics .",
    "black hole pulses have extremely steep size distributions that could be explained by a suppression of large pulses for a certain period after a large pulse . for cosmic rays ,",
    "the energy size distribution implies a fractal dimension of @xmath298 and a proportionality between energy and length scales ( @xmath276 ) according to our fd - soc model , which can be explained by the nature of in - situ detections that capture only a small fraction of the avalanche volume .",
    "whatever the correct interpretations are for those phenomena with unexpected size distributions , the application of our standard fd - soc model can reveal alternative scaling laws that can be tested in future measurements .",
    "a major achievement of our standard fd - soc model is the fact that it can predict and explain , in a universal way , the powerlaw indices of different soc parameters ( lengths , durations , fluxes , energies , waiting times ) in most of the considered astrophysical applications , which do not depend on the details of the underlying physical mechanisms .",
    "we have also to appreciate that the macroscopic approach of soc statistics does not depend on the microscopic fine structure of each soc process , unlike the mathematical / numerical soc models , which produce different powerlaw slopes depending on the assumed re - distribution rule , and partially do not fulfill universality .",
    "our macroscopic fractal - diffusive soc model may also be suitable to correctly describe the statistics of other , soc - related , nonlinear processes , such as percolation or turbulence , an aspect that needs to be investigated in future .",
    "the author acknowledges the insightful and helpful comments by the referee , and thanks yuta notsu and takuya shibayama for providing kepler data .",
