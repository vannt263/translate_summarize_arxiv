    "during the last two decades the investigation of the properties of hadronic matter at high density and high temperature has become one of the key issues of nuclear physics .",
    "relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions offer the unique possibility to study nuclear matter under such extreme conditions . at incident energies around 1@xmath2  gev the formation of a hot and dense reaction zone ,",
    "the so  called nuclear fireball , has been verified experimentally @xcite . according to model calculations ,",
    "nuclear matter can be compressed for time spans of @xmath510    15  fm / c to densities of @xmath52    3 times the nuclear groundstate density @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , temperatures up to @xmath5100  mev may be reached and a substantial fraction of the nucleons participating in the collision is excited to heavier , short",
    " lived resonance states which decay predominantly by meson emission @xcite .",
    "hence , the fireball at sis ",
    "energies represents a system of interacting nucleons , resonances , and mesons . under these conditions",
    "the onset of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry , which is a fundamental symmetry of quantum chromodynamics , could manifest itself in modifications of hadron properties inside the fireball . at beam energies of @xmath510@xmath2  gev ,",
    "as they are available at the ags accelerator facility at bnl ( brookhaven ) , even higher baryon densities and temperatures are reached in the initial stage of the fireball @xcite .",
    "in addition to the chiral phase transition one may approach in those collisions already the phase transition from a hadron gas to a quark  gluon plasma due to the deconfinement of quarks and gluons .",
    "in such a scenario the fireball would no longer be purely hadronic during the whole collision process but the initial stage should be a partonic phase until hadronization takes place . at the sps accelerator facility at cern ( geneva ) , where the highest energy nuclear collisions can be studied using 158@xmath2  gev pb beams",
    ", the possibility exists that the phase boundary to quark matter has been crossed already , although evidence for the phase transition is still rather tentative @xcite .",
    "it is the common goal of numerous experiments at sis , ags , and sps to investigate the hadronic or partonic fireball , respectively . since each relativistic nucleus ",
    "nucleus collision , irrespective of the initial beam energy , develops a hadronic phase in its final stage , the importance of studying the purely hadronic fireball as it is formed in the sis ",
    "energy regime is evident .",
    "various observables , e.g. particle yields , spectra , and correlations are sensitive to different parameters of the fireball",
    ". only the combination of all observables may finally give a complete picture of @xmath2  gev heavy ",
    "ion collisions which up to now are not fully understood .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on @xmath0 and @xmath1meson production as probes of the fireball .",
    "chapter  2 summarizes briefly some basic features of the time evolution of relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions as far as meson production is concerned . on the basis of the presently available systematics of @xmath0 and @xmath1meson production the motivation for a thermal  model ansatz to describe hadronic matter at freeze  out",
    "in the chapters  3 and  4 the model of a hadron gas in thermal and hadrochemical equilibrium is described in detail and applied to the fireball as observed at sis .",
    "after fixing the model parameters by experimental data , the part of the nuclear  matter phase diagram probed by hadronic observables at sis is determined and compared to corresponding results from ags and sps .",
    "furthermore , the chemical composition of the fireball at freeze  out is estimated and the consistency of particle yields and spectra is studied .",
    "numerous investigations of relativistic nucleus ",
    "nucleus reactions have shown that for central collisions at sis the relative motion of target and projectile matter in the reaction zone almost comes to rest .",
    "while for heavy target  projectile combinations at moderate energies an isotropically expanding source at midrapidity has been observed @xcite , indications for incomplete stopping have been found in rapidity ",
    "density distributions for energies above @xmath5 1@xmath2  gev @xcite .",
    "the size of the fireball thus arising depends on the centrality of the collision .",
    "following the participant  spectator model , the geometrical overlap of the two nuclei determines the number of nucleons @xmath6 which are directly involved .",
    "in addition the energy available in the nucleon  nucleon system @xmath7 can be obtained from the projectile energy , so that the initial conditions of the system are fixed . in the subsequent development",
    "the energy is transformed into the excitation of thermal and collective degrees of freedom : it turns into heat and provides the mass stored in the resonance states , and it builds up compression and produces the flow of the expanding matter .    in a simplified picture",
    "the mesons are trapped during the compression phase in a cyclic process of generation , absorption , and re  emission , exemplified for nucleons @xmath8 , @xmath9 mesons , and @xmath10 resonances by @xmath11 . within this approach",
    "the bulk of the mesons are released only with the onset of the expansion phase , when due to the decreasing matter density mesons and baryons decouple .",
    "this implies that hadronic probes reflect only the final state of nucleus  nucleus collisions and do not provide direct insight into the early , high  density phase of the collision as leptonic probes would do since they are not affected by the strong interaction .",
    "the moment in the expansion process when particles cease to interact strongly is called freeze  out .",
    "one distinguishes between chemical freeze  out and thermal freeze  out which correspond to those points in time when the relative abundances or the momentum distributions of the particles , respectively , are no longer changed .",
    "obviously only inelastic collisions of nucleons , resonances , and mesons can change the relative particle yields while the momentum distributions are governed by the total interaction cross sections of these particles in the fireball . therefore , chemical freeze  out",
    "does not occur after thermal freeze  out . even in this simplified sudden freeze  out scenario one has to make sure that for the determination of freeze  out parameters only such observables are combined with each other which are fixed approximately simultaneously . in our ansatz particle yields",
    "reflect chemical freeze  out while momentum distributions reflect thermal freeze  out .",
    "the latter , however , are not purely thermal spectra in the sense that they follow boltzmann distributions but they are modified by resonance decays and reflect in addition collective flow phenomena .",
    "it is an interesting question to what extent the fireball at freeze  out can be described in terms of thermal and hadrochemical equilibrium .",
    "equilibrium could be achieved through frequent scattering of particles in the fireball and it would be reached without any doubt if only the lifetime of the fireball would be sufficiently long . it has been shown that at ags and sps the hadronic observables including strange particles are in quite good agreement with such a scenario @xcite , while at sis the situation is still unclear .",
    "only recently it has been reported that midrapidity momentum spectra of nonstrange particles measured in central @xmath12ni  +  @xmath12ni collisions are consistent with thermal equilibrium in the energy regime from 1@xmath2  gev to 2@xmath2  gev if in addition collective radial flow is taken into account @xcite .",
    "for the same reactions also agreement with chemical equilibrium has been claimed @xcite .",
    "this analysis , however , was based on proton , deuteron , thermal charged pion , and @xmath13resonance yields .",
    "the latter were obtained by decomposing the pion momentum spectra into a thermal component and into a component from resonance decay . in this paper",
    "we follow a different strategy : in order to keep the possibility to distinguish chemical and thermal freeze  out as individual stages in the time evolution of relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions we strictly confine ourselves to an isolated discussion of relative particle yields and momentum distributions , respectively , without combining these informations . in order to keep the thermal model as simple as possible we do not take into account particles with open strangeness since at sis energies",
    "their production rate is very small .",
    "furthermore , an additional model parameter , the strangeness chemical potential @xmath14 , which , however , could be fixed by requesting strangeness conservation , would be necessary to incorporate strangeness consistently into the thermal model .",
    "with respect to strange particles , only recently cleymans and co  workers have claimed that at 1.93@xmath2  gev the particle yields including the strange hadrons agree with a complete chemical equilibrium scenario at freeze ",
    "out @xcite .",
    "this would mean that not only the nonstrange and strange hadrons among themselves could be equilibrated",
    "seperately , but even equilibrium between both the strange and the nonstrange sectors would have been established .",
    "the neutral @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons which have large decay branches into pairs of photons represent unique probes for the expanding fireball and therefore provide the basis for our discussion .",
    "pions and @xmath1 mesons are the only mesons with substantial production rates at sis energies .",
    "while the pionic degree of freedom is also covered by the spectroscopy of the charged members of the multiplet , it is only through gamma - ray spectroscopy that the @xmath1 meson becomes observable in nucleus",
    " nucleus collisions .",
    "these two neutral mesons can be simultaneously identified by a two - photon invariant - mass analysis of coincident photon pairs . during the last almost ten years the taps collaboration performed a series of systematic meson  production experiments covering incident energies from 0.1@xmath2  gev to 2.0@xmath2  gev .",
    "these measurements have established an extended data base for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in light ( @xmath15c + @xmath15c ) , intermediate ( @xmath16ar , @xmath16ca + @xmath17ca , @xmath12ni + @xmath12ni , @xmath18kr + @xmath17zr ) and heavy systems ( @xmath19au + @xmath19au ) @xcite .",
    "the primary information are the spectral distributions of the mesons , measured down to zero transverse momentum in narrow bins around midrapidity , and the meson yields , which are determined in the same rapidity intervals and are then extrapolated to the full solid angle .",
    "all data concerning the experiments @xmath16ar + @xmath17ca at 0.18@xmath2  gev @xcite ,",
    "@xmath12ni + @xmath12ni at 1.9@xmath2  gev @xcite , and @xmath16ca + @xmath17ca at 2.0@xmath2  gev @xcite presented in this paper are not yet submitted for publication and should therefore be regarded as preliminary results .",
    "the first important result is obtained from the systematic investigation of the meson yields .",
    "[ metag ] shows the average meson multiplicities @xmath20 , measured in inclusive reactions of various systems , normalized to the average number of participating nucleons @xmath21 as a function of the energy @xmath22 available in the @xmath23 system normalized to the corresponding meson mass .",
    "a steep rise of the relative yields with increasing energy is visible .",
    "in addition , a weaker dependence on the size of the collision system is observed with the clear tendency for smaller inclusive yields in the heavier systems .",
    "this has also been observed in charged  pion production experiments @xcite . in first approximation",
    "all data points fall onto a smooth curve indicating that the meson - production probabilities mainly depend on the available energy .",
    "this is quite remarkable because @xmath0 and @xmath1 production proceed through different baryon resonances : @xmath0 mesons mainly originate from @xmath13resonance decays , while the heavier @xmath1 mesons essentially come from the n(1535 ) resonance which , at sis energies , is the only significantly populated baryon resonance with a large decay channel into @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the fact that the specific production mechanism seems not to influence the observed meson yields significantly may be interpreted as a first indication for meson emission from an equilibrated source .",
    "the second important result concerns the average transverse momenta @xmath24 . fig .",
    "[ ptsys ] shows @xmath24 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons as a function of the energy available in the @xmath23 system .",
    "although the experimental uncertainties for the @xmath1 data are large compared to the @xmath0 data , the @xmath1 transverse - momentum spectra reveal at a given energy a tendency towards larger mean values @xmath24 which is manifest around 2.0@xmath2  gev beam energy . to give a measure for the expected order of magnitude of @xmath24",
    ", it can be noted that for the decay of @xmath13 and @xmath25 resonances at rest one would get @xmath26  mev . ] and @xmath27  mev , respectively .",
    "for both mesons @xmath24 increases with the available energy which could be interpreted in terms of a considerable heating of the collision zone or a gradually growing population of the full resonance ",
    "mass distributions . for @xmath0 mesons",
    "the rise of the average transverse momenta becomes smaller with increasing energy which is supported by a measurement of @xmath24 for @xmath28 mesons produced at 3.37@xmath2  gev bombarding energy @xcite .",
    "the steep rise of the meson  production yields on the one hand and the onset of a saturation of average transverse momenta on the other hand clearly indicate that with increasing bombarding energy the fraction of available energy converted into massive particles becomes larger compared to the chaotic motion of particles in the fireball .    finally , the distributions of the transverse mass @xmath29 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are discussed . at midrapidity the transverse mass of a particle is equivalent to its total energy in the center  of  mass system . following @xcite the transverse",
    " mass distribution of particles with mass @xmath30 , emitted isotropically from a thermal source and characterized by a boltzmann temperature @xmath31 , can approximately be described by    @xmath32    in fig .",
    "[ mtscal ] transverse  mass distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are plotted together with fits according to the parametrization given in eq .  [ mtdis ] for three different collision systems at incident energies near 2@xmath2  gev . within each reaction",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra exhibit almost identical inverse  slope parameters @xmath31 which in addition do not change significantly with the mass of the colliding nuclei .",
    "such a behaviour , the so  called @xmath29 scaling , is well known in high  energy physics @xcite .",
    "having in mind the different production mechanisms for both meson species it is furthermore quite remarkable that for @xmath33 the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data roughly fall on one commen line for all systems .",
    "this indicates that the energy required to produce a given transverse mass completely determines the relative abundance of the meson species near midrapidity . for low @xmath29",
    ", however , individual differences become apparent . fig .",
    "[ mtscal ] shows a systematic enhancement over the exponential rise extrapolated from the high@xmath29 region if one goes from the light to the heavier systems .",
    "possible mechanisms that have been suggested to account for this fact involve enhanced pion rescattering through resonance states in the heavier systems @xcite and multiple pion decay of heavy resonances @xcite . the same observation , namely the @xmath29 scaling on an absolute scale and the low@xmath29 enhancement in heavier systems , is not only manifest at 2@xmath2  gev but has been recognized at various energies down to 0.8@xmath2  gev and seems to be a general feature of heavy ",
    "ion collisions in the sis  energy regime @xcite .",
    "although @xmath29 scaling does not prove that the meson source actually has reached thermal or hadrochemical equilibrium , the particle spectra of such an equilibrated source would be dominated by phase space as it is observed .    in summary ,",
    "the systematic study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson yields and momentum distributions reveals strong indications for the hypothesis that these mesons may be emitted from a source in hadrochemical and thermal equilibrium .",
    "in our ansatz we assume that at the point of chemical freeze  out the fireball can be described in terms of an equilibrated hadron gas . as constituents of this ideal gas",
    "we take into account nucleons , deuterons , pions , @xmath1 mesons , and all nonstrange baryon resonances up to a mass of 1.76  gev , which corresponds to @xmath34 for the nucleon  nucleon system at 2@xmath2  gev beam energy .",
    "nuclear matter in hadrochemical equilibrium has a particle composition characterized by a temperature @xmath3 and a baryon chemical potential @xmath4 . considering the grand ",

    "isospin degeneracy , @xmath39 the total energy in the local restframe , and @xmath40 the baryon number of the particle species @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42  sign refers to the different statistics for fermions or bosons , respectively .",
    "eq .  [ grandcan ] can not be applied to the fireball at sis directly but only after the inclusion of two modifications . to account for the fact that the fireball occupies only a finite volume",
    ", a surface correction has to be included . for an estimate of this correction",
    "we assume a spherical volume with radius @xmath43 giving a momentum dependent correction factor @xmath44 @xcite which has to be multiplied with the integrand in eq .",
    "[ grandcan ] :    @xmath45    introducing this correction leads to a decrease of individual particle  number densities down to 60    70  % of the uncorrected values for reasonable radius parameters .",
    "particle yield ratios , however , are much less affected by the correction since there the correction almost cancels out .",
    "the radius parameter should be chosen such that the number of baryons inside the spherical volume is in reasonable agreement with the average number of nucleons participating in the collision .",
    "we use a constant radius parameter of 5.5  fm for all beam energies . if one assumes that chemical freeze  out",
    "may occur at baryon densities in the range between 0.2 and 0.6  @xmath46 ( see below ) the corresponding freeze  out volume would then contain @xmath523  -  70 baryons .",
    "we verified that in our model analysis a variation of @xmath43 by @xmath422  fm changes the resulting temperatures and chemical potentials by less than 5  % .",
    "the second modification is related to the fact that resonances do not have a fixed mass but exhibit a broad mass distribution .",
    "in contrast to thermal  model analyses of ags and sps data , a reasonable treatment of mass distributions can not be neglected in the 1@xmath2  gev energy regime since in this case the energy available in the @xmath23 system is small compared to the difference in mass between the nucleon and the resonances except for the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "that is the reason why the @xmath13 is by far the most abundantly populated resonance and why all the other resonances are populated predominantly in the tails of their mass distributions towards lower masses .",
    "[ grandcan ] therefore has to be folded with normalized mass distributions @xmath47 which are @xmath48 functions for all particle species except resonances .",
    "the following scheme to parametrize resonance mass distributions is to a large extent adopted from @xcite .",
    "we distribute the resonance masses according to lorentzian functions @xmath49 which are determined by the mean resonance masses @xmath50 and the mass dependent total and partial decay widths @xmath51 :    @xmath52    we use the following parametrizations for the partial decay widths @xmath51 where the mean masses @xmath50 and widths @xmath53 at @xmath50 are taken from @xcite :    * for the pion decay width of the @xmath13 resonance we adopt the parametrization given by koch et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath30 is the actual mass of the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are the pion three momenta in the restframe of the resonance with mass @xmath30 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 in the cutoff function has the value @xmath58  mev . * the 1@xmath9 and @xmath1 decay widths of the higher baryon resonances",
    "are given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the branching ratio of the resonance into the @xmath61 or @xmath1 decay channel at @xmath50 , respectively , @xmath62 is the angular momentum of the emitted meson , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the momenta of the meson in the restframe of the decaying resonance as defined above . in this case",
    "we use @xmath63 it has to be noted that the only resonance decaying into the @xmath1 channel in our ansatz is the @xmath25 resonance .",
    "* the 2@xmath9 decay widths of higher baryon resonances are described in terms of one  step processes .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite where in a first step a higher baryon resonance decays into a @xmath13 or @xmath64 resonance and a pion or into a nucleon and a @xmath65 or @xmath66 meson , and where in a second step the intermediate resonance decays after propagation through the nuclear medium into a nucleon and a pion or into a nucleon and two pions .",
    "since the population of higher resonances is small compared to the @xmath13 population we simplify this procedure by treating the 2@xmath9 decay as a direct process where the resonance decays into a nucleon and an object with angular momentum @xmath67 and twice the pion mass which subsequently decays into two pions .",
    "the partial decay widths can then be written in complete analogy to the 1@xmath9 and @xmath1 decay width . *",
    "additional decay channels are neglected .",
    "furthermore , one could consider an excluded  volume correction to take into account the hadron ",
    "hadron hard ",
    "core repulsion or in other words the difference between a real and an ideal hadron gas .",
    "since such a correction does not play a significant role for particle  yield ratios as demonstrated in @xcite we stick to the ideal hadron  gas model . another argument to omit the excluded volume correction",
    "is the fact that chemical freeze ",
    "out seems to occur at baryon densities of the order of half the nuclear groundstate density or even less as discussed below .",
    "the hadron gas therefore is rather dilute which justifies the assumption of non  interacting particles at chemical freeze  out .",
    "finally , the isospin asymmetry in collisions of heavy nuclei , which has to be considered if the model analysis for example relies on charged  pion yields , is not taken into account in the present analysis .",
    "this is adequate since our approach is based on the isospin  independent @xmath1meson yields and the neutral  pion yields which in the isobar model correspond to one third of the total pion yields irrespective of the actual isospin asymmetry in the system .    in summary ,",

    "if one assumes an isentropic expansion of the collision zone one can make use of the fact that the ratio @xmath90 remains constant in that case .",
    "the baryon chemical potential at thermal freeze  out may then be calculated from the one at chemical freeze  out just by multiplication with the ratio of the temperatures . the resulting thermal freeze ",
    "out parameters are included in fig .",
    "[ phase ] together with a curve representing the thermal freeze  out of hadronic matter .",
    "while at sis energies thermal and chemical freeze  out seem to almost coincide , at higher energies the freeze  out parameters clearly indicate that thermal freeze  out reflects a later stage of the collision process as lower temperatures compared to chemical freeze  out are deduced .",
    "neutral  pion and @xmath1-meson data measured near midrapidity in the energy range from 0.8@xmath2  gev to 2.0@xmath2  gev are consistent with the assumption that the hadronic fireball , which evolves during relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions , may be in hadrochemical or thermal equilibrium at the moment of chemical or thermal freeze  out , respectively .",
    "in contrast to ultrarelativistic collisions studied at ags and sps , chemical and thermal freeze  out seem to occur at almost the same stage of the expansion process at sis energies .",
    "another difference is that the freeze  out parameters at sis are far below the phase boundary between a hadron gas and a quark  gluon plasma .",
    "this implies that the early stage of an ultrarelativistic nucleus  nucleus collision may come close to that phase transition while at sis the early , high  density phase is described best by the term resonance matter .",
    "neutral  meson yields and spectra reflect only one facet of the very complex process of a relativistic nucleus  nucleus collision . with these observable alone",
    "it is not possible to decide whether chemical or thermal equilibrium , respectively , is actually reached during any stage of such a collision .",
    "further experiments and analyses investigating complementary probes are necessary to clarify to what extent nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions in the sis ",
    "energy range can be described within the framework of equilibrium models .",
