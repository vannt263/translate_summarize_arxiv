    "developing a truly adaptive data analysis method is important for our understanding of many natural phenomena .",
    "traditional data analysis methods , such as the fourier transform , use pre - determined basis .",
    "they provide an effective tool to process linear and stationary data . however , there are still some limitations in applying these methods to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data",
    ". time - frequency analysis has been developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional techniques by representing a signal with a joint function of both time and frequency .",
    "the recent advances of wavelet analysis have opened a new path for time - frequency analysis .",
    "a significant breakthrough of wavelet analysis is the use of multi - scales to characterize signals .",
    "this technique has led to the development of several wavelet - based time - frequency analysis techniques @xcite .",
    "another important approach in the time - frequency analysis is to study instantaneous frequency of a signal .",
    "some of the pioneering work in this area was due to van der pol @xcite and gabor @xcite , who introduced the so - called analytic signal ( as ) method that uses the hilbert transform to determine instantaneous frequency of a signal .",
    "this analytic signal method is one of the most popular ways to define instantaneous frequency . until very recently",
    ", this method works mostly for monocomponent signals in which the number of zero - crossings is equal to the number of local extreme @xcite .",
    "there were other attempts to define instantaneous frequency such as the zero - crossing method @xcite and the wigner - ville distribution method @xcite .",
    "however most of these methods are rather restrictive .",
    "more substantial progress has been made only recently with the introduction of the emd method @xcite .",
    "the emd method provides an effective tool to decompose a signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions ( imf ) that allow well - behaved hilbert transforms for computation of physically meaningful time - frequency representation .",
    "we remark that the hilbert spectral representation based on the wavelet projection has also been carried in @xcite .    inspired by the emd method and the recently developed compressed ( compressive ) sensing theory",
    ", we propose a data - driven time - frequency analysis method .",
    "there are two important ingredients of this method .",
    "the first one is that the basis that is used to decompose the data is derived from the data rather than determined _ a priori_. this explains the name `` data - driven '' in our method . the second ingredient is to look for the sparsest decomposition of the signal among the largest possible dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions . the adoption of this data - driven basis and the search for the sparsest decomposition over this highly redundant basis make our time - frequency analysis method fully adaptive to the signal . as we are going to demonstrate later",
    ", our method can reveal some hidden physical information of the signal , such as trend and instantaneous frequency .",
    "our data - driven time - frequency analysis method is motivated by the observation that many multi - scale data often have an intrinsic sparse structure in the time - frequency plane , although its representation in the physical domain could be quite complicated .",
    "the challenge is that such sparse representation is valid only for certain multiscale basis that is adapted to the data and is unknown _",
    "a priori_. finding such nonlinear multiscale basis is an essential ingredient of our method . in this sense ,",
    "our problem is more difficult than the compressed ( compressive ) sensing problem in which the basis is assumed to be known _ a priori_. one way to find the adaptive basis is to learn from the data if we have a large number of data samples that share the similar physical property .",
    "this does not apply to our problem since we deal with only a single signal .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by reformulating the problem as a nonlinear optimization among the largest possible dictionary .",
    "the trade - off is that such decomposition is not unique .",
    "we need to exploit the intrinsic sparse structure of the data to select the sparsest one among all the possible decompositions .    in our method , the dictionary is given as following : @xmath6 where @xmath2 is a linear space consisting of functions smoother than @xmath7 .",
    "the construction of @xmath2 with given @xmath8 is in general an overcomplete fourier basis given below : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the largest integer less than @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a parameter to control the smoothness of @xmath2 .",
    "we then decompose the signal over this dictionary by looking for the sparest decomposition .",
    "the sparest decomposition can be obtained by solving a nonlinear optimization problem : @xmath14 when the signal is polluted by noise , the equality in the above constraint is relaxed to be an inequality depending on the noise level .",
    "this optimization problem can be viewed as a nonlinear version of the @xmath5 minimization problem and is known to be very challenging to solve .",
    "inspired by the compressed ( compressive ) sensing theory @xcite , we propose a @xmath15-regularized nonlinear matching pursuit method to solve this nonlinear optimization problem .",
    "our nonlinear matching pursuit is inspired by the linear matching pursuit method @xcite .",
    "we first extract an intrinsic mode function @xmath16 from the signal @xmath17 by looking for the one which matches the signal @xmath17 best among all the elements in @xmath18 .",
    "this would imply the following nonlinear optimization problem : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a regularization parameter and @xmath21 is the representation of @xmath22 in @xmath2 .",
    "in some cases when the signals are periodic , we can choose @xmath23 .",
    "denote by @xmath24 the residual after subtracting @xmath25 from @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "we can then treat @xmath24 as a new signal to extract the remaining imfs .",
    "there are two important advantages of this nonlinear matching pursuit approach .",
    "the first one is that this method is very stable to noise perturbation .",
    "the second one is that it can be implemented very efficiently . in the case of @xmath23",
    ", the resulting method can be solved approximately by fast fourier transform , and the complexity of our algorithm is of order @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of data sample points that we use to represent the signal .",
    "the low computational cost and the robustness to noise perturbation make this method very effective in many applications .",
    "moreover , for data that satisfy certain scale separation conditions , we prove that our method recovers the imfs and their instantaneous frequencies accurately .",
    "we perform extensive numerical experiments to test the robustness and the accuracy of our data - driven time - frequency analysis method for both synthetic data and some real data .",
    "our results show that the nonlinear matching pursuit can indeed decompose a multiscale signal into a sparse collection of intrinsic mode functions .",
    "we also compare our method with the original emd method . for the data without noise",
    ", we find that our method gives results comparable to those obtained by the emd method .",
    "moreover , for noisy data , our method seems to provide better estimation of the instantaneous frequency and imfs than emd and recently developed eemd method @xcite .",
    "a common difficulty in many data analysis methods is the relatively large error produced near the boundary of the data set . for the emd method , this source of error",
    "is referred to as the `` end effect '' , which is primarily caused by the use of cubic spline interpolation in constructing the envelope and the median of the signal .",
    "our data - driven time - frequency analysis method seems to be less sensitive to this end effect , especially when the data satisfy certain scale separation property .",
    "we have also extended our data - driven time - frequency analysis method to decompose data that do not have a good scale separation property . by incorporating a shape function into our dictionary that is adapted to the signal",
    ", we can also extend our method to decompose data with strong intra - wave modulation .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that our data - drive time - frequency analysis method can be applied to recover the original signal with missing data in certain interval . the recovered signal as well as",
    "their instantaneous frequency seems to have reasonably good accuracy .",
    "we also apply our method to decompose under - sampled data .",
    "the result is quite encouraging even if the under - sampled data are polluted by noise .",
    "we remark that there has been some recent progress in developing a mathematical framework for an emd like method using synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms by daubechies , lu and wu @xcite .",
    "this seems to be a very promising approach .",
    "we have performed some preliminary numerical experiments to compare the performance of our method with the synchrosqueezed wavelet approach . in many cases , we find that the two methods give comparable and complementary results .",
    "we are currently exploring a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of our method with those of the synchrosqueezed wavelet approach .",
    "our preliminary results seem quite encouraging .",
    "we will report this in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of some existing data analysis methods such as the matching pursuit , the basis pursuit and the emd method .",
    "we introduce our adaptive data analysis method . in section 3 , a simplified version of our data - driven time - frequency data analysis method is introduced for periodic data which can be implemented efficiently by using the fast fourier transform . in section 4 ,",
    "we present some numerical experiments , include incomplete or under - sampled data , to demonstrate the performance of our method . in section 5 , we generalize our data - driven time - frequency data analysis method to analyze data with poor scale separation property and data with strong intra - wave modulation .",
    "we present some preliminary error analysis of our data - driven time - frequency data analysis method in section 6 .",
    "the technical proof of the main result is deferred to the appendix .",
    "some conclusions are made in section 7 .",
    "a considerable focus of activities in the recent signal processing literature has been the development of the sparse signal representations over a redundant dictionary . among these methods ,",
    "the matching pursuit @xcite and the basis pursuit @xcite have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to the development of the compressed ( compressive ) sensing .",
    "all these methods consist of two parts : a dictionary to decompose the signal and a decomposition method to select the sparsest decomposition .",
    "a dictionary is a collection of parameterized waveforms @xmath29 .",
    "many dictionaries have been proposed in the literature . here",
    "we review a few of them that have been used widely .    * a fourier dictionary . *",
    "a fourier dictionary is a collection of sinusoidal waveforms .",
    "more specifically , the waveforms consist of the following two families , @xmath30 for the standard fourier dictionary , @xmath31 runs through the set of all cosines with fourier frequencies @xmath32 , and all sines with fourier frequencies @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of sample points .",
    "we can also obtain an overcomplete fourier dictionary by sampling the frequencies more finely .",
    "let @xmath35 .",
    "we may choose @xmath36 for cosines and @xmath37 for sines .",
    "this is an @xmath38-fold overcomplete system . in the algorithm for non - periodic data",
    ", we will use this kind of overcomplete fourier dictionary .    * a wavelet dictionary . *",
    "a wavelet dictionary is a collection of translations and dilations of the basic mother wavelet @xmath39 , together with translations of the scaling function @xmath40 defined below : @xmath41 for the standard wavelet dictionary , we let @xmath42 run through the discrete collection of mother wavelets with dyadic scales @xmath43 , and locations that are integer multiples of the scale @xmath44 , and the collection of scaling functions at the coarse scale @xmath45 .",
    "this dictionary consists of @xmath34 waveforms , which form an orthonormal basis . as in the fourier dictionary",
    ", an overcomplete wavelet dictionary can be obtained by sampling the locations more finely .    * a time - frequency dictionary . *",
    "a typical time - frequency dictionary is the gabor dictionary due to gabor ( 1946 ) . in this dictionary , we take @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is frequency , @xmath48 is a location , @xmath49 is a phase , and @xmath50 is the duration .",
    "we define the waveform as follows : @xmath51 such waveforms consist of frequencies near @xmath31 and essentially vanish far away from @xmath48 .",
    "* an emd dictionary*. we can also define a dictionary via the emd method . in the emd method @xcite , the dictionary is the collection of all intrinsic mode functions ( imf ) , which are functions defined descriptively by enforcing the following two conditions :    * the number of the extreme and the number of the zero crossings of the function must be equal or differ at most by one ; * at any point of the function , the average of the upper envelope and the lower envelope defined by the local extreme should be zero ( symmetric with respect to zero ) .    inspired by the emd method , we will use a variant of the emd dictionary to construct a sparse decomposition of a signal via nonlinear optimization .      in this subsection",
    ", we review a few decomposition methods that can be used to give a sparse decomposition of a signal by exploiting the intrinsic sparsity structure of the signal . in recent years",
    ", there have been a lot of research activities in looking for the sparest representation of a signal over a redundant dictionary @xcite , i.e. look for a decomposition of a signal @xmath52 over a given dictionary @xmath53 as @xmath54 with the smallest @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the residual .",
    "whether or not a signal can be decomposed into a sparse decomposition depends on the choice of the dictionary that we use to decompose the signal . in general , a more redundant dictionary tends to give better adaptivity , which implies better sparsity of the decomposition .",
    "however , when the dictionary is highly redundant , the decompositions are not unique . we need to give a criterion to pick up the `` best '' decomposition among all the possible choices .    * matching pursuit . * in @xcite ,",
    "mallat and zhang introduced a general decomposition method called the matching pursuit that exploits the sparsity of a signal .",
    "starting from an initial approximation @xmath57 and a residual @xmath58 , the matching pursuit builds up a sequence of sparse approximations step by step . at stage @xmath59 , the method identifies an atom that best matches the residual and then adds it to the current approximation , so that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "after @xmath55 steps , one has a representation of the form ( [ decomp - dic ] ) , with residual @xmath63 . a similar algorithm was proposed for gabor dictionaries by s. qian and d. chen @xcite .",
    "an intrinsic feature of this algorithm is that when stopped after a few steps , it yields an approximate sparse representation using only a few atoms .",
    "when the dictionary is orthogonal , the method works perfectly .",
    "if the dictionary is not orthogonal , the situation is less clear .",
    "recently , j. tropp and a. gilbert proved that under some assumptions on the basis , the orthogonal matching pursuit can solve the original @xmath64 minimization problem @xcite",
    ".    * basis pursuit . *",
    "another important class of decomposition methods is the basis pursuit , which was introduced by s. chen , d. donoho and m. saunders @xcite .",
    "first , we reformulate the decomposition problem in the following way .",
    "suppose we have a discrete dictionary of @xmath65 waveforms and we collect all these waveforms as columns of an @xmath34 by @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 .",
    "the decomposition problem ( [ decomp - dic ] ) can be reformulated as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the vector of coefficients in ( [ decomp - dic ] ) .",
    "the basic idea of the basis pursuit is to find a sparse representation of the signal whose coefficients have a minimal @xmath69 norm , i.e. the decomposition is obtained by solving the problem @xmath70    recently , the basis pursuit has received a lot of attention , since it is found that under some conditions the basis pursuit can recover the exact solution of the original @xmath64 minimization problem @xcite .",
    "there has been extensive research to obtain a sparse representation by the basis pursuit in a variety of applications .",
    "an essential component of the basis pursuit is to solve the @xmath15 minimization problem .",
    "the computational cost of solving this @xmath15 minimization is more expensive than the least - square problem in the matching pursuit , although a powerful split bregman method has been introduced by goldstein and osher to speed up the @xmath15 minimization problem considerably @xcite .    * the emd decomposition via a sifting process . *",
    "the emd method decomposes a signal to its imfs sequentially .",
    "the basic idea behind this approach is the removal of the local median from a signal by using a sifting process .",
    "specifically , for a given signal , @xmath17 , one tries to decompose it as a sum of the local median @xmath71 , and an imf .",
    "a cubic spline polynomial is used to interpolate all the local maxima to obtain an upper envelope , and to interpolate all the local minima to obtain a lower envelope . by averaging the upper and lower envelopes ,",
    "one obtains an approximate median for @xmath71 .",
    "one then decides whether or not to accept the obtained @xmath71 as our local median depending on whether @xmath72 gives an acceptable imf that satisfies the two conditions that are specified in the definition of an emd dictionary .",
    "if @xmath72 does not satisfy these conditions , one can treat @xmath72 as a new signal and construct a new candidate for the imf by using the same procedure described above .",
    "this sifting process continues until we obtain a satisfactory imf , which we denote as @xmath73 .",
    "now we can treat @xmath74 as a new signal , and apply the same procedure to generate the second imf , @xmath75 .",
    "this procedure continues until @xmath76 is either monotone or contains at most one extremum . for more details of the sifting process",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "* decomposition based on a nonlinear @xmath77 minimization .",
    "* inspired by the emd method , we proposed a decomposition method based on a nonlinear @xmath77 minimization in our previous paper @xcite . here",
    "@xmath77 is the total variation of the third order derivative of a function , defined as @xmath78 .",
    "we use a @xmath77 norm because the @xmath79 norm or the total variation norm is not strong enough to enforce the regularity of the median or the envelope of our decomposition .",
    "for example , the use of the total variation norm , which is very popular in imaging processing community , tends to give a decomposition whose median or envelope is piecewise constant , which is referred to as the stair - case effect . the @xmath77 norm ,",
    "on the other hand , gives a much smoother decomposition for both the median and the envelope .",
    "incidentally , the minimization using the @xmath77 norm tends to favor piecewise cubic polynomials such as cubic splines .",
    "thus , our method gives results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained by the emd method which uses cubic splines to construct its median and envelope from the local extrema of the signal .",
    "we now give a brief review of our @xmath77 decomposition method .",
    "in our approach , every element in our dictionary automatically satisfies the conditions of imf .",
    "there is no need to do any sifting or use the hilbert transform in our method .",
    "first , we decompose a signal @xmath17 into its local median @xmath80 and an imf @xmath81 by solving the following nonlinear optimization problem : @xmath82 to solve this nonlinear optimization problem , we proposed the following newton type of iterative method :    * * initialization : * @xmath83 . * * main iteration : * * * update @xmath84 by solving the following linear optimization problem : @xmath85 * * update the phase function @xmath49 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 $ ] is chosen to enforce that @xmath88 is an increasing function : @xmath89 : \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\theta_k^{n-1}-\\alpha\\arctan",
    "\\left(\\frac{b_1^n}{a_1^n}\\right ) \\right)\\ge 0\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * * if @xmath90 , stop .",
    "otherwise , go to step 1 .    in @xcite",
    ", we performed a number of numerical experiments and compared the results with those obtained by the emd ( or eemd ) method .",
    "our results show that this method shares many important properties with the original emd method . moreover",
    ", its performance does not depend on numerical parameters such as the number of sifting or the stop criterion , which seem to have a major effect on the original emd method .",
    "there are two limitations of this approach .",
    "the first one is that the computational cost to solve the @xmath91 minimization problem is relatively high , even if we use the split bregman method of goldstein and osher @xcite .",
    "the second one is that this method is more sensitive to noise perturbation , although a nonlinear filter was introduced to alleviate this difficulty . in comparison",
    ", the nonlinear matching pursuit method we introduce in this paper is very stable to noise perturbation and has a relatively low computational cost .",
    "our adaptive data analysis method is based on finding the sparsest decomposition of a signal by solving a nonlinear optimization problem .",
    "first , we need to construct a large dictionary that can be used to obtain a sparse decomposition of the signal . in principle , the larger the dictionary is , the more adaptive ( or sparser ) the decomposition is .      in our method ,",
    "the dictionary is chosen to be : @xmath92 let @xmath2 be the collection of all the functions that are smoother than @xmath7 .",
    "in general , it is most effective to construct @xmath2 as an overcomplete fourier basis given below : @xmath93 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the largest integer less than @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a parameter to control the smoothness of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath18 can be written as @xmath94 in some sense , the dictionary @xmath18 defined above can be considered as a collection of imfs .",
    "this property makes our method as adaptive as the emd method .",
    "we also call an element of @xmath18 as an imf .",
    "since the dictionary @xmath18 is highly redundant , the decomposition over this dictionary is not unique .",
    "we need a criterion to select the `` best '' one among all possible decompositions .",
    "we assume that the data we consider have an intrinsic sparse structure in the time - frequency plane in some nonlinear and nonstationary basis .",
    "however , we do not know this basis _ a priori _ and we need to derive ( or learn ) this basis from the data .",
    "based on this consideration , we adopt sparsity as our criterion to choose the best decomposition .",
    "this criterion yields the following nonlinear optimization problem : @xmath95 or @xmath96 if the signal has noise with noise level @xmath50 .    after this optimization problem",
    "is solved , we get a very clear time - frequency representation : @xmath97      the above optimization problem can be seen as a nonlinear @xmath5 minimization problem .",
    "thanks to the recent developments of the compressed ( compressive ) sensing , it is now well known that there are two kinds of methods to solve a @xmath5 minimization problem : the basis pursuit and the matching pursuit . since the dictionary we adopt here has infinitely many elements , the generalization of the basis pursuit is not so straightforward .",
    "but the idea of the matching pursuit can be generalized .",
    "applying the idea of the matching pursuit to our problem , we obtain the following algorithm :    * @xmath98 . *",

    "otherwise , go to step 1 .    in the first step of the above iterative algorithm , unlike the standard matching pursuit",
    ", we solve a @xmath15 regularized nonlinear least - square problem @xmath106 .",

    "this is the most expensive part of the algorithm especially when the number of the data points is large . in this subsection",
    ", we consider the special case when the data are periodic . in this case",
    ", we can introduce an method based on fast fourier transform(fft ) instead of solving the @xmath69 regularized least square problem .",
    "one big advantage for periodic data is that we can use the standard fourier basis to construct the @xmath2 space in the following way instead of the overcomplete fourier basis given in ( [ 2-fold - fourier ] ) .",
    "@xmath118 where @xmath13 is a parameter to control the smoothness of functions in @xmath2 and @xmath119 is a positive integer .",

    "in order to abate the dependence on the initial guess , we use the following procedure to gradually improve our approximation to the phase function so that it converges to the correct value .    first ,",
