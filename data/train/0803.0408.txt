    "in this paper we study the closed convex evolving plane curves .",
    "more precisely , we consider the following initial value problem @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the mean curvature , @xmath4 is the unit inner normal at @xmath5 , @xmath8 stands for a smooth strictly convex closed curve , @xmath18 and @xmath7 are the initial velocity and inner normal vector of @xmath8 , respectively , and with @xmath11 denoting the unit tangent vector and @xmath19 the arclength parameter , @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21    this system is an initial value problem for a system of partial differential equations for @xmath12 , which can be completely reduced to an initial value problem for a single partial differential equation for its support function . the latter equation is a hyperbolic monge - ampre equation . our first result is the following local existence theorem for the initial value problem ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",

    ". then there exists a class of the initial velocities such that the solution of ( [ 1.6 ] ) with @xmath8 and @xmath26 as initial curve and initial velocity of the initial curve , respectively , exists only at a finite time interval @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath28 , the solution @xmath23 converges to a point .",
    "after rescaling as gage and hamilton did , we can see that the limiting solution will be a circle .",
    "we will also introduce hyperbolic mean curvature flow with dissipative terms . a close relation between our hyperbolic mean curvature flow and the string evolving in the minkowski space - time",
    "will be derived in the last section of the paper .    for reader s convenience ,",
    "we briefly discuss some history of parabolic and hyperbolic mean curvature flows .",
    "the parabolic theory for the evolving of plane curves , which in its simplest form is based on the curve shortening equation @xmath29 relating the normal velocity @xmath30 and the curvature @xmath3 , has been extremely successful in providing geometers with great insight .",
    "for example , gage and halmilton @xcite proved that , when the curve is strictly convex , the deformation decreases the isoperimetric ratio , and furthermore if it shrinks to a point @xmath31 , the normalized curves , obtained by  blowing up \" the curves at @xmath31 so that its enclosed areas is @xmath32 , must tend to the unit circle in a certain sense .",
    "grayson @xcite generalized this result and showed that a smooth embedded plane curve first becomes convex and then shrinks to a point in a finite time .",
    "these results can be applied to many physical problems such as crystal growth , computer vision and image processing .",
    "one of the important applications of mean curvature flow is that huisken and ilmanen developed a theory of weak solutions of the inverse mean curvature flow and used it to prove successfully the riemannian penrose inequality which plays an important role in general relativity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is very few hyperbolic versions of mean curvature flow .",
    "melting crystals of helium exhibits a phenomenon generally not found in other materials : oscillations of the solid - liquid interface in which atoms of the solid move only when they melt and enter the liquid ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gurtin and podio - guidugli @xcite developed a hyperbolic theory for the evolution of plane curves .",
    "rostein , brandon and novick - cohen @xcite studied a hyperbolic theory by the mean curvature flow equation @xmath33where @xmath34 is the normal acceleration of the interface , @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "a crystalline algorithm was developed for the motion of closed polygonal curves .",
    "the hyperbolic version of mean curvature flow is important in both mathematics and applications , and has attracted many mathematicians to study it .",
    "he , kong and liu @xcite introduced hyperbolic mean curvature flow from geometric point of view .",
    "let @xmath36 be a riemannian manifold and @xmath37 be a smooth map .",
    "when @xmath38 is an isometric immersion , the laplacian of @xmath12 is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mean curvature ( i.e. , the trace of the second fundamental form ) and @xmath4 is the unit inner normal vector .",
    "the hyperbolic mean curvature flow is the following partial differential equation of second order @xmath41 @xmath42 is called a solution of the hyperbolic mean curvature flow if it satisfies the equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "he , kong and liu in @xcite proved that the corresponding system of partial differential equations are strictly hyperbolic , and based on this , they also showed that this flow admits a unique short - time smooth solution and possesses the nonlinear stability defined on the euclidean space with dimension larger than 4 .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear wave equations satisfied by curvatures are also derived in @xcite , these equations will play an important role in future study .",
    "the hyperbolic mean curvature flow was considered as one of the general hyperbolic geometric flows introduced by kong and liu , see @xcite for more discussions for related hyperbolic flows and their applications to geometry and einstein equations .",
    "recently , lefloch and smoczyk @xcite studied the following geometric evolution equation of hyperbolic type which governs the evolution of a hypersurface moving in the direction of its mean curvature vector @xmath43 where @xmath44 stands for the unit tangential vector of the initial hypersurface @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the local energy density and @xmath47 , in which @xmath48 .",
    "this flow stems from a geometrically natural action containing kinetic and internal energy terms .",
    "they have shown that the normal hyperbolic mean curvature flow will blow up in finite time . in the case of graphs ,",
    "they introduce a concept of weak solution suitably restricted by an entropy inequality and proved that the classical solution is unique in the larger class of entropy solutions . in the special case of one - dimensional graphs ,",
    "a global - in - time existence result is established .",
    "moreover , an existence theorem has been established under the assumption that the bv norm of initial data is small .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", a hyperbolic monge - ampre equation will be derived and a theorem on local existence and uniqueness of the solution , i.e. , theorem 1.1 will be proved . in section 3 ,",
    "an example is given and then some properties of the evolving curve have been established .",
    "the main result  theorem 1.2 will be proved in section 4 . in section 5 , we consider the normal hyperbolic mean curvature flow with the dissipative term and get the hyperbolic equation of @xmath49 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "section 6 is devoted to illustrating the relations between the hyperbolic mean curvature flow and the evolution equations for the relativistic string in the minkowski space @xmath16 .",
    "roughly speaking , an evolving curve is a smooth family of curves @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in which @xmath22 is called the duration of @xmath12 . for a given curve @xmath53 , the underlying physics must be independent of the choice of the parameter @xmath54 , and hence can involve @xmath12 only through intrinsic quantities such as curvature , normal acceleration and normal velocity , which are independent of parametrization . on the other hand , this invariance allows us to use any convenient parametrization .",
    "the following notion is needed in our study .    [ 1.1 ] a curve @xmath55 evolves normally if @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "definition 2.1 can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall restrict our attention to the parametrization ( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "such a parametrization significantly simplifies the analysis .",
    "the normally evolving curve was first investigated by angenent and gurtin @xcite and then further studied by lefloch and smoczyk @xcite .",
    "the following result is important , it shows that within a large class of time - dependent curves there is no essential loss of generality in limiting attention to curves that evolves normally .",

    "this important lemma was proved in @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the initial value problem ( [ 1.6 ] ) , the initial velocity field is normal to the curve , it can be proved that this property is preserved during the evolution , that is to say , the flow ( 1.1 ) is automatically a normal flow with respect to @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath61 , it is non - local partial differential equation , and it is not easier to handle than the second order partial differential equation in ( 1.1 ) . ] @xmath62 where @xmath63 , hence we have @xmath64 here we denote by @xmath65 the arclength parameter of the curve @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath4 and @xmath11 are independent of the parameter @xmath87 , which can be proved as follows : @xmath88 then @xmath89 hence , @xmath90 and @xmath91 by the chain rule , @xmath92 and @xmath93    the support function of @xmath12 is given by @xmath94 its derivative satisfies @xmath95 where @xmath96 namely , the tangent vector is orthogonal to the unit normal vector .",
    "and then the curve can be represented by the support function @xmath97 thus all geometric quantities of the curve can be represented by the support function .",

    "theorem 2.1 is nothing but theorem 1.1 , which is one of main results in this paper .",
