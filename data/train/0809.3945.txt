    "collisions play an important role in gyrokinetics .",
    "an accurate collision operator is important for calculation of neoclassical transport  @xcite and the growth rate of instabilities such as trapped electron modes ,  @xcite dissipative drift waves ,  @xcite and microtearing modes  @xcite in moderate collisionality regimes .",
    "collisions can also affect the damping of zonal flows  @xcite and other modes that provide a sink for turbulent energy . in their absence , arbitrarily fine scales can develop in phase space ,  @xcite which can in some cases pose challenges for discrete numerical algorithms , especially in the long - time limit ;  @xcite even a modest amount of collisions can make accurate numerical calculation much easier .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of a small collisionality keeps the distribution function smooth enough in velocity space that the standard gyrokinetic ordering  @xcite for velocity space gradients is satisfied .",
    "for example , the parallel nonlinearity ,  @xcite given by @xmath0\\ ] ] enters at the same order as the other terms in the gyrokinetic equation if the typical scale of parallel velocity fluctuations , @xmath1 , is one order smaller in the gyrokinetic expansion parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) than the thermal speed , @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the non - boltzmann part of the perturbed distribution function ( defined more rigorously in the next section ) , @xmath7 is the electrostatic potential , @xmath8 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is particle charge , @xmath11 is particle mass , and @xmath12 denotes the gyroaverage at fixed guiding center position @xmath13 .",
    "while such a situation is possible in the collisionless limit , a small collisionality prohibits the formation of structures with @xmath14 .",
    "the level of collisionality necessary to negate the importance of the parallel nonlinearity can be calculated by assuming a balance between collisions and fluctation dynamics : @xmath15 \\rightarrow \\omega h \\sim   \\nu v_{th}^{2 } { \\frac{\\partial^{2}h}{\\partialv^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] describes the effect of collisions on @xmath6 , @xmath17 is the fluctuation frequency , and @xmath18 is the collision frequency . from the above expression , we see that scales in velocity space become small enough for the parallel nonlinearity to be important only when the collision frequency satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "such low collisionalities are not present in most fusion plasmas of interest .",
    "furthermore , if such an ordering had to be adopted , the lowest order distribution function could become strongly non - maxwellian .",
    "this is a problem for @xmath20 codes that assume an equilibrium maxwellian .    in light of the above considerations , it is important to include an accurate treatment of dissipation in gyrokinetic simulations . in order to faithfully represent gyrokinetic plasma dynamics at reasonable numerical expense , we take the view that the form of the dissipation should be such that it : ensures satisfaction of the standard gyrokinetic ordering ; locally conserves particle number , momentum , and energy ; satisfies boltzmann s @xmath21-theorem ; and efficiently smooths phase space structure .",
    "the first of these requirements has already been discussed in the context of the parallel nonlinearity .",
    "conservation properties have been found to be important , for instance , in calculations of the neoclassical ion thermal conductivity ,  @xcite as well as in a wide range of problems in fluid dynamics .",
    "the existence of an @xmath21-theorem is critical for entropy balance  @xcite and for the dynamics of the turbulent phase space cascade .",
    "@xcite efficient smoothing of phase space structures is necessary to resolve numerical simulations at reasonable computational expense .",
    "a commonly employed dissipation mechanism in gyrokinetic simulations is artificial ( hyper ) dissipation , often in physical ( position ) space .",
    "@xcite ideally , the form of the artificial dissipation should be chosen to satisfy the requirements listed above and should be tested for convergence to the collisionless result .",
    "of course , artificial dissipation alone is unable to capture the correct dynamics for moderate to strongly collisional systems where turbulent fluxes and other observable quantities depend sensitively on collisionality ; for such systems , a physical dissipation model is desired .    a number of such model physical collision operators are employed in gyrokinetic codes",
    ".  @xcite these range in complexity from the krook operator  @xcite to the rutherford - kovrizhnikh operator  @xcite to the catto - tsang operator ,  @xcite all of which have previously been implemented in gs2 ( see , e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "however , none of these satisfy all of the properties we require of a good collision operator ( see appendix c of the accompanying paper  @xcite for a fuller discussion of this point ) . here",
    ", we discuss numerical implementation in gs2 of an improved model operator which : includes the effects of both pitch - angle scattering and energy diffusion ( i.e. efficiently smooths in phase space and ensures gyrokinetic ordering ) ; conserves particle number , momentum , and energy ; satisfies boltzmann s @xmath21-theorem ; and reduces to the linearized landau test - particle operator in the large @xmath22 limit .",
    "a full description of this operator and a discussion of its desirable properties , including comparison with the previous models of catto - tsang and hirshman - sigmar ,  @xcite is given in the companion paper  @xcite ( henceforth paper i ) .",
    "we will focus on how such an operator can be implemented efficiently in gyrokinetic codes while maintaining the properties listed above and on how our gyrokinetic dissipation scheme ( or any other ) might be tested against a number of plasma physics problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the gyroaveraged collision operator from paper i and examine properties that should be taken into account when using it in numerical simulations ; in section iii , we describe our numerical implementation of the collision operator ; in section iv we present numerical results for a number of tests demonstrating the ability of our collision operator implementation to reproduce correct collisional and collisionless physics ; and in section v , we summarize our findings .",
    "in order to include collisions in gyrokinetics , we follow the treatment of ref .   and assume the collision frequency , @xmath18 , to be the same order in the gyrokinetic ordering as the characteristic fluctuation frequency , @xmath17 . and @xmath23 as subsidiary orderings .",
    "@xcite ] this leads to the requirement that the distribution of particles in velocity space is maxwellian to lowest order and allows us to represent the total distribution function through first order in @xmath2 ( where @xmath24 is ion gyroradius and @xmath25 is the scale length of equilibrium quantities ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is particle position , @xmath28 is guiding center position , @xmath29 is magnetic moment , @xmath30 is particle energy , @xmath31 is a maxwellian , @xmath7 is the electrostatic potential , @xmath32 is the magnitude of the background magnetic field , @xmath33 is the background temperature , @xmath10 is particle charge , and @xmath34 . the gyrokinetic equation governing the evolution of @xmath6 is given by @xmath35 { \\right>}_{{\\mathbf{r } } } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the drift velocity of guiding centers , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the vector potential , @xmath40 is the poisson bracket of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the gyroaverage of @xmath41 at constant @xmath13 , and @xmath44 { \\right>}_{{\\mathbf{r}}}$ ] is the gyroaveraged collision operator .    for @xmath44 { \\right>}_{{\\mathbf{r}}}$ ] , we restrict our attention to the model collision operator presented in paper i. we work within the framework of the continuum gyrokinetic code gs2 ,  @xcite which assumes periodicity in the spatial directions perpendicular to @xmath45 in order to reduce the simulation volume to a thin flux tube encompassing a single magnetic field line .",

    "having specified the form of our collision operator , we now discuss some of its fundamental properties that guide our choice of numerical implementation .",
    "even when the collisionality approaches zero , @xmath48 $ ] can have appreciable amplitude .",
    "there are two reasons for this : first , the velocity dependence of @xmath62 , @xmath65 , and @xmath63 is such that each go to infinity as @xmath66 ( so low - velocity particles are always collisional ) ; and second , we expect the distribution function to develop increasingly smaller scales in @xmath67 and @xmath68 as collisionality decreases , so that the amplitude of the terms proportional to @xmath69 and @xmath70 may remain approximately constant ( i.e. @xmath48 \\not\\rightarrow 0 $ ] as @xmath71 ) .",
    "@xcite the fact that @xmath48 $ ] can be quite large even at very low collisionalities means that it should be treated implicitly if one wants to avoid a stability limit on the size of the time step , @xmath72 . in section iii",
    ", we describe our fully implicit implementation of the collision operator .",
    "since collisions locally conserve particle density , momentum , and energy , one would like these properties to be guaranteed by the discrete version of the collision operator .",
    "mathematically , this means that the density , momentum , and energy moments of the original ( un - gyroaveraged ) collision operator must vanish ( for same - species collisions ) .",

    "this is accomplished by taylor expanding the bessel functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , one can show that  @xcite @xmath73 { \\right>}_{{\\mathbf{r}}}{\\right>}_{{\\mathbf{r}}}\\\\ & = \\sum_{{\\mathbf{k}}}e^{i{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot{\\mathbf{r } } } \\int d^{3}v \\begin{pmatrix } 1 \\\\",

    "thus , local conservation properties are assured in gyrokinetics as long as the density , momentum , and energy moments of @xmath75 $ ] vanish : @xmath82=0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : momcons}\\ ] ] we describe how this is accomplished numerically in section iii .",
    "in contrast with local conservation properties , the statement of the @xmath21-theorem is unmodified by gyroaveraging the collision operator . defining the entropy as @xmath83",

    ", the non - locality of the gyroaveraging operation leads to no modification of the @xmath21-theorem because of the definition of entropy as a phase - space averaged quantity ( as opposed to local conservation properties , which involve only velocity - space averages ) .",

    "as argued in section ii , we must treat the collision operator implicitly to avoid a stability limit on the size of @xmath72 .",
    "we use a first order accurate backward - difference scheme in time instead of a second order scheme ( such as crank - nicholson  @xcite ) because it is well known that the crank - nicholson scheme introduces spurious behavior in solutions to diffusion equations when taking large timesteps ( and because godunov splitting is only first order accurate for multiple splittings , which will be introduced shortly ) .    with this choice , @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 in general , @xmath98 is a dense matrix , with both energy and pitch - angle indices .",
    "inversion of such a matrix , which is necessary to solve for @xmath96 in our implicit scheme , is computationally expensive .",
    "we avoid this by taking two additional simplifying steps .",
