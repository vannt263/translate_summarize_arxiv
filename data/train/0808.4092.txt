    "time evolution of spin systems with different initial gibbs measures and different dynamics shows various interesting features . in particular , in the transient regime , the structure of the evolved measure can have various properties , which may change in time .",
    "for example , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite the question was investigated whether the time - evolved measure is gibbsian or not .",
    "results about conservation , loss and recovery of the gibbs property could be obtained .",
    "ising spin systems were considered in @xcite and different types of unbounded spin systems in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite compact continuous spin systems are investigated . in more physical terms , the question is whether one can or can not associate an effective temperature ( @xmath1 inverse interaction norm ) to the system when it is in this non - equilibrium situation @xcite",
    ".    variations of both the initial and the dynamical temperature ( the temperature of the gibbs measure(s ) to which the system will converge , which is a property of the dynamics ) have influence on the existence ( or absence ) of the quasilocality property of the time - evolved measure of the system .",
    "this quasilocality property is a necessary ( and almost sufficient ) condition to have gibbsianness @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the time - evolved measure for planar rotors stays gibbsian for either short times , starting at arbitrary temperature and with arbitrary - temperature - dynamics , or for high- or infinite - temperature dynamics starting from a high- or infinite - temperature initial measure for all times . furthermore the absence of the quasilocality property",
    "is shown for intermediate times for systems starting in a low - temperature regime with zero external field and evolving under infinite - temperature dynamics .",
    "the fact that there exist intermediate times where gibbsianness is lost for xy spins even in two dimensions is remarkable , because those systems do not have a first - order phase transition due to the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "however , it turns out that conditionings can induce one . to establish the occurrence of such conditional first - order transitions is a major step in the proof that a certain measure is not gibbsian .",
    "similar short - time results for more general compact spins can be found in @xcite .",
    "these results about compact continuous spins can be seen as intermediate between those for discrete ising spins and the results for unbounded continuous spins .",
    "conservation , loss and recovery results can be found in @xcite for ising spins and conservation for short times and loss for larger times for unbounded spins in @xcite .",
    "conservation for short times for more general dynamics ( e.g. kawasaki ) for discrete spins was proven in @xcite , and for unbounded spins with bounded interactions in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite . as in that paper",
    ", we consider xy - spins living on a lattice sites on @xmath0 and evolving with time .",
    "the initial gibbs measure is a nearest neighbour ferromagnet , but now in a positive external field .",
    "so we start in the regime where there is a unique gibbs measure .",
    "the system is evolving under infinite - temperature dynamics .",
    "we expect , that just as in the ising case , whatever the initial field strength , we have after the short times when the measure is always gibbsian , if the initial temperature is low , that a transition towards a non  gibbsian regime occurs , and that after another , longer time , the measure becomes gibbs again .",
    "we can prove a couple of results which go some way in confirming this picture .",
    "we prove that when the initial field is small , and @xmath2 is at least 3 , there exists a time interval , depending on the initial field , during which the time - evolved measure is non - gibbsian .",
    "we present a partial result , indicating why we expect the same phenomenon to happen in two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we argue that the presence of an external field is responsible for the reentrance into the gibbsian regime for larger times , independently of the initial temperature .",
    "we can prove this for the situation in which the original field is strong enough .",
    "let us introduce some definitions and notations .",
    "the state space of one continuous spin is the circle , @xmath3 .",
    "we identify the circle with the interval @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are considered to be the same points .",
    "thus the configuration space @xmath7 of all spins is isomorphic to @xmath8 .",
    "we endow @xmath7 with the product topology and natural product probability measure @xmath9 . in our case",
    "we take @xmath10 .",
    "an interaction @xmath11 is a collection of @xmath12-measurable functions @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is finite .",
    "@xmath12 is the @xmath17-algebra generated by the canonical projection on @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction @xmath11 is said to be of * finite range * if there exists a @xmath19 s.t .",
    "@xmath20 implies @xmath21 and it is called * absolutely summable * if for all @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "we call @xmath24 a * gibbs measure * associated to a reference measure @xmath25 and interaction @xmath11 if the series @xmath26 converges ( @xmath11 is absolutely summable ) and @xmath24 satisfies the dlr equations for all @xmath22 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the partition function and @xmath29 proportional to the inverse temperature .",
    "the set of all gibbs measures associated to @xmath11 and @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "now , instead of working with gibbs measures on @xmath8 we will first investigate gibbs measures as space - time measures @xmath31 on the path space @xmath32 . in @xcite deuschel introduced and described infinite - dimensional diffusions as gibbs measures on the path space @xmath33)^{{\\mathbb{z}}^d}$ ] when the initial distribution is gibbsian .",
    "this approach was later generalized by @xcite who showed that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the set of initial gibbs measures and the set of path - space measures @xmath31 .",
    "we consider the process @xmath34 defined by the following system of stochastic differential equations ( sde ) @xmath35 for @xmath36 and the initial interaction @xmath37 given by @xmath38 @xmath39 some non - negative constants and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 denotes the initial hamiltonian associated to @xmath42 and @xmath43 is independent brownian motion moving on a circle with transition kernel given ( via the poisson summation formula ) @xmath44 for each @xmath45 , just as we used in @xcite .",
    "note also that the eigenvalues of the laplacian on the circle , which is the generator of the process , are given by @xmath46 , see also @xcite .",
    "we remark that the normalization factor @xmath47 is absorbed into the single - site measure @xmath25 .",
    "obviously @xmath42 is of finite range and absolutely summable , so the associated measure @xmath48 given by @xmath49 is gibbs .    for the failure of gibbsianness we will use the necessary and sufficient condition of finding a point of essential discontinuity of ( every version of ) the conditional probabilities of @xmath48 , i.e. a so - called * bad configuration*. it is defined as follows    a configuration @xmath50",
    "is called * bad * for a probability measure",
    "@xmath51 if there exists an @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that for all @xmath54 there exists @xmath55 and configurations @xmath56 , @xmath57 such that @xmath58    the measure at time @xmath59 can be viewed as the restriction of the two - layer system , considered at at times @xmath5 and @xmath59 simultaneously , to the second layer .",
    "in order to prove gibbsianness or non - gibbsianness we need to study the joint hamiltonian for a fixed value @xmath60 at time @xmath59 .",
    "the time - evolved measure is * gibbsian * if for every fixed configuration @xmath60 the joint measure has no phase transition in a strong sense ( e.g. via dobrushin uniqueness , or via cluster expansion / analyticity arguments ) . in that case",
    ", an absolutely summable interaction can be found for which the evolved measure is a gibbs measure . on the other side",
    "the measure is * non - gibbsian * if there exists a configuration @xmath60 which induces a phase transition for the conditioned double - layer measure at time @xmath5 which can be detected via the choice of boundary conditions . in that case",
    "no such interaction can be found , see for example @xcite .",
    "the results we want to prove are the following .",
    "let @xmath31 be the law of the solution @xmath61 of the planar rotor system @xmath62 in @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath37 given by @xmath65 , with @xmath29 the inverse temperature , @xmath66 some non - negative constant and @xmath67 the external field , and @xmath2 at least 3 . then , for @xmath68 large enough , and @xmath69 small enough , there is a time interval @xmath70 such that for all @xmath71 the time - evolved measure @xmath72 is not gibbs , i.e. there exists no absolute summable interaction @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .    for any @xmath69 chosen such that @xmath75 is large enough , compared to @xmath29",
    ", there exists a time @xmath76 , such that for all @xmath77 the time - evolved measure is gibbs , @xmath78 .",
    "* proof of theorem 2.1 : * + we consider the double layer system , describing the system at times @xmath5 and @xmath59 .",
    "we can rewrite the transition kernel in hamiltonian form , and we will call the hamiltonian for the two - layer system the dynamical hamiltonian , ( as it contains the dynamical kernel )",
    ". it is formally given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the transition kernel on the circle and @xmath82 is formally given by @xmath83    * 1 . *",
    "first we want to prove that there exists a time interval where gibbsianness is lost . for this",
    "we have to find a `` _ _ bad configuration _ _ '' such that the conditioned double - layer system has a phase transition at time 0 , which implies @xmath84 for the time - evolved measure .",
    "we expect this to be possible for each strength of the external field , and in each dimension at least 2 . at present",
    "we can perform the programme only for weak fields , and for dimension at least 3 .",
    "we also show a partial result , at least indicating how a conditioning also in d=2 can induce a phase transition .",
    "thus , given @xmath85 , we immediately see that the spins from the initial system prefer to follow the field and point upwards ( take the value @xmath86 at each site @xmath22 ) . to compensate for that , we will condition the system on the configuration where all spins point downwards ( at time @xmath59 ) , i.e. @xmath87 . thus the spin configuration in which all spins point in the direction opposite to the initial field will be our `` bad configuration '' .",
    "we expect that then the minimal configuration of @xmath88 , so the ground states of the conditioned system at time 0 , will need to compromise between the original field and the dynamical ( conditioning ) term . in the ground state(s )",
    "either all spins will point to the right , possibly with a small correction @xmath89 , @xmath90 or to the left @xmath91 , also with a small correction .",
    "@xmath89 is a function depending on @xmath59 .",
    "finally these two symmetry - related ground states will yield a phase transition of the `` spin - flop '' type , also at low temperatures .",
    "it is important to observe that for this intuition to work , it is essential that the rotation symmetry of the zero - field situation will not be restored , due to the appearance of higher order terms from the expansion of the transition kernel , as we will indicate below .    we perform a little analysis for the logarithm of the transition kernel @xmath92",
    ". let @xmath87 .",
    "we want to focus on the first three terms coming from the expansion of the logarithm .",
    "@xmath93 where @xmath94 \\1_{\\lbrace",
    "n \\neq 1,2,3 \\rbrace \\cup \\lbrace k \\neq 1 \\rbrace},\\ ] ] is of order @xmath95 , for details see the appendix .",
    "we define @xmath96 .",
    "note that given @xmath75 , there is a time interval where the effect of the initial field is essentially compensated by the field induced by the dynamics ( containing the @xmath97 . for large times the initial field term dominates all the others and the system",
    "is expected to exhibit a ground ( or gibbs ) state following this field . for intermediate times",
    "the other terms are important , too .",
    "if we consider a small initial field , it is enough to consider the second and third order terms which we indicated above .",
    "those terms create , however , the discrete left - right symmetry for the ground states which will now prefer to point either to the right or to the left .    for the moment we forget about the rest term @xmath98 and",
    "investigate the restricted hamiltonian @xmath99 which is formally equal to @xmath100 to be more precise , the external field including the inverse temperature @xmath75 will be chosen small enough , and then the inverse temperature @xmath29 large enough .",
    "we want first to find the ground states of the restricted hamiltonian @xmath101 which are points @xmath102 .",
    "it is fairly immediate to see that in the ground states all spins point in the same direction , so we then only need to minimize the single - site energy terms .",
    "the first - order term more or less compensates the external field , and the second - order term is maximal when @xmath103 is minimal , thus when one has the value @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "the higher - order terms will only minimally change this picture .",
    "we can define a function @xmath106 depending on @xmath59 such that asymptotically @xmath107 yields the following unique maxima @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the function @xmath89 is a correction of the ground states pointing to the left or right .",
    "we present a schematic illustration of the two ground states .",
    "@xmath110    @xmath111    hence for every arbitrarily chosen small external field @xmath69 , we find a time interval depending on @xmath69 , such that we obtain two reflection symmetric ground states of all spins pointing either ( almost ) to the right @xmath112 or all spins pointing ( almost ) to the left @xmath113 .",
    "the rest term @xmath98 does not change this behaviour since it is suppressed by the first terms and is of order @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , it respects the left - right symmetry .",
    "we will first , as a partial argument , show that the interaction @xmath114 has a low - temperature transition in @xmath115 .    to show this we notice that we are in a similar situation as in @xcite",
    ". the conditioning of the double - layer system for the xy spins created left - right symmetric ground states .",
    "now we want to apply a percolation argument for low - energy clusters to prove that such that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "the arguments follow essentially @xcite and are based on @xcite .",
    "the potential corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath116 is clearly a @xmath117-potential , that is a potential which is nonzero only on subsets of the unit cube @xcite .",
    "it is of finite range , translation - invariant and symmetric under reflections .    including the rest term ( which is a translation - invariant single - site term ) does not change this .",
    "a fortiori the associated measure is reflection positive and we can again use the same arguments as in @xcite to deduce that for @xmath29 large enough , there is long - range order .",
    "this argument indicates how conditioning might induce a phase transition .",
    "however , to get back to our original problem , that is , to prove the non - gibbsianness of the evolved state we need an argument which holds for values of not only of @xmath69 , but of @xmath75 which are small uniformly in temperature .",
    "then only we can deduce that there exists a time interval @xmath118 such that @xmath119 .    to obtain this , for @xmath120",
    ", we can invoke a proof using infrared bounds ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that the infrared bound proof , although primarily developed for proving continuous symmetry breaking , also applies to models with discrete symmetry breaking as we have here .",
    "in fact we may include the rest term without any problem here , as the symmetry properties of the complete dynamical hamiltonian are the same as that of our restricted one , and adding single - site terms does not spoil the reflection positivity . from this an initial temperature interval",
    "is established , where gibbsianness is lost after appropriate times .    indeed , the infrared bound provides a lower bound on the two - point function which holds uniformly in the single - site measure , ( which in our case varies only slightly anyway , as long as the field and the compensating term due to the kernel are small enough ) .",
    "this shows that a phase transition occurs at sufficiently low temperatures , as for decreasing temperatures the periodic boundary condition state converges to the symmetric mixture of the right- and left - pointing ground - state configurations .",
    "* comment * : one might expect that , by judiciously looking for other points of discontinuity , the time interval of proven non - gibbsianness might be extended , hopefully also to @xmath121 ; however , qualitatively this does not change the picture .",
    "in fact , there are various configurations where one might expect that conditioning on them will induce a first - order transition . for example , the xy model in at least two dimensions in a weak random field which is plus or minus with equal probability is expected to have such transitions @xcite . the same situation should occur for various appropriately chosen ( in particular random ) choices of configuration where spins point only up or down . in a somewhat similar vein , if the original field is not so weak , and thus also higher terms are non - negligible , we expect that qualitatively not much changes , and there will again be an intermediate - time regime of non - gibbsianness at sufficiently low temperatures .    * about the proof of theorem 2.2 : * let us now turn to the second statement . here",
    "the initial temperature does not affect the argument .",
    "the intuitive idea , as mentioned before , is as follows : as after a long time , the term due to the conditioning becomes much weaker than the initial external field -however weak it is- , uniformly in the conditioning , and thus the system should behave in the same way as a plane rotor in a homogeneous external field , and have no phase transition .",
    "however , the higher - order terms which were helpful for proving the non - gibbsianness , now prevent us using the ferromagneticity of the interaction .",
    "indeed , we can not use correlation inequalities of fkg type , and we will have to try analyticity methods .",
    "in fact , we expect that the statement should be true for each strength of the initial field .",
    "indeed , once the time is large enough , the dynamical single - site term should be dominated by the initial field , and , just as in that case , one should have no phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , to conclude that we can consider the dynamical single - site term as a small perturbation , in which the free energy and the gibbs measure are analytic , although eminently plausible , does not seem to follow from dunlop s yang - lee theorem .    for high fields , we can either invoke cluster expansion techniques , showing that the system is completely analytic , or dobrushin uniqueness statements .",
    "precisely such claims were developed for proving gibbsianness of evolved measures at short times in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "a direct application of those proofs also provides our theorem , which is for long times .",
    "in this paper we extended the results from @xcite and show some results on loss and recovery of gibbsianness for xy spin systems in an external field . giving a low - temperature initial gibbs measure in a weak field and evolving with infinite - temperature dynamics we find a time interval where gibbsianness is lost .",
    "moreover at large times and strong initial fields , the evolved measure is a gibbs measure , independently of the initial temperature .",
    "generalizations are possible to include for example more general finite - range , translation invariant ferromagnetic interactions @xmath37 .",
    "we conjecture , but at this point can not prove , that both the loss and recovery statements actually hold for arbitrary strengths of the initial field .",

    "the logarithm of the transition kernel is given by @xmath122 since the first term of the series of @xmath92 is dominating we can write @xmath123 the rest term @xmath124 is smaller than @xmath125 uniformly in @xmath126 .",
