    "very recently , the d collaboration and the cdf collaboration at the fermilab tevatron reported their updated measurements of the mass difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the new bounds on the mass difference are  @xcite : @xmath10 it was the first time that both the lower bound and the upper bound for the @xmath0 mixing are presented .",
    "especially the cdf result has reached an accuracy of about 1% .",
    "the new results are important for the precision test of the standard model ( sm ) , especially for the determination of the unitary triangle . moreover ,",
    "if the sm predictions are consistent with the above results , these data will put severe constraints on the flavor structure of the possible new physics models beyond the sm .    in the literature , there have already been many discussions about the implications of the new measurements . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors carried out model - independent analysis of the constraints on extensions of the sm .",
    "there are also model - dependent calculations in some new physics models beyond the sm @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the effects of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with r - parity violation ( mssm - rpv )  @xcite on the neutral meson mixing .",
    "r - parity is a discrete symmetry defined by @xmath11 , where b is the baryon number , l is the lepton number and s is the spin of the particle . in a supersymmetric extension of the sm ,",
    "all the particles in the sm have @xmath12 , while all the superpartners have @xmath13 .",
    "r - parity conservation is imposed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to keep proton stable . however , this requirement is not necessary for a fundamental theory , and one can always introduce lepton number or baryon number violating terms in the lagrangian .",
    "for the neutral meson mixing , the relevant terms in the lagrangian are @xmath14 these interaction terms can induce @xmath0 mixing through tree level sneutrino exchange , and thus , probably , the relevant combination of couplings @xmath15 will be severely constrained by the recent measurements@xcite .",
    "similarly , the terms shown in eq .",
    "( [ largrangian ] ) also can induce the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing , which were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite at the leading - order , and the constraints on the relevant combinations of couplings through comparing with data were given by  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the mass of the sneutrino of the @xmath19-th generation .",
    "however , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite did not include the contributions of the sm , since they believed that both theoretical and experimental results involved considerable uncertainties at that time .",
    "recently , both sm theoretical predictions and experimental results has been improved significantly @xcite .",
    "thus , besides investigating of @xmath20-@xmath21 mixing , it is also worthwhile to reinvestigate the constraints on the combinations of r - parity violating ( rpv ) couplings with the updated data on @xmath22-@xmath23 and @xmath24-@xmath25 mixing including the sm contributions .",
    "moreover , in general , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections are significant , so we also calculate the nlo qcd effects on the above neutral meson mixing in this paper .",
    "in addition to the above mass differences , the r - parity violating couplings can also contribute to the cp asymmetries in the meson decay processes , when the couplings are complex .",
    "so the combinations of rpv couplings discussed above can affect observables related to time - dependent cp violation in processes such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this paper",
    ", we also consider the constraints on the relevant combinations of mssm - rpv couplings from these cp violation observables .",
