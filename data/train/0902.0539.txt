    "kallenberg  @xcite , kingman  @xcite , diaconis and freedman  @xcite , and aldous  @xcite are among many studies of exchangeable random variables ( r.v . )  with polish state spaces , a fundamental topic in many fields of probability and statistics .",
    "nevertheless , many models in stratified sampling , statistical mechanics , chemistry , communication networks , biology , etc . , actually involve _ varied _ classes of similar objects , which we call `` particles '' .",
    "some examples can be found in graham  @xcite and graham and robert  @xcite .",
    "several classical results for exchangeable systems are extended to such multi - class particle systems in graham  @xcite , under a natural partial exchangeability assumption called _ multi - exchangeability_. it is notably proved that the convergence in law of a family of _ finite _ systems , with limit a system with _",
    "infinite _ class sizes , is equivalent to the convergence in law of the corresponding family of vectors of the empirical measures within each class , with limit the vector of the directing measures of each limit class ( which is exchangeable , and the directing measure is given by the de finetti theorem ) .",
    "this result allows use of compactness - uniqueness techniques on the measure vectors for convergence proofs , extending those for propagation of chaos proofs for exchangeable systems introduced by sznitman  @xcite and developed among others by mlard  @xcite and graham  @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further motivation .    in the present paper , we extend this convergence result to multi - exchangeable systems with _ fixed _ class sizes , which may be both finite and infinite , by showing that their convergence in law is equivalent to the convergence in law for the vectors of measures with components the empirical measures for finite classes and the directing measure for infinite classes ( given by the de finetti theorem ) .",
    "we first extend another result of @xcite , and prove that the conditional law of a multi - echangeable system , given the vector of measures defined above , corresponds to sampling _ independently _ without replacement from _ each _ finite class and i.i.d .  from the directing measure for _ each _ infinite class , the remarkable fact being independence between _ different _ classes .",
    "these new results are related to , and combine well with , those of @xcite .",
    "for instance , results in @xcite can yield a tractable large size limit for a finite model of interest , one hopes that the long - time behavior of the finite model is well approximated by that of the limit , and the new results can help us study all the long - time behaviors and their relationship .",
    "they can be likewise used for _",
    "e.g. _ fluid limits or diffusion approximations .",
    "all state spaces @xmath0 are polish , and the weak topology is used for the space of probability measures @xmath1 which is then also polish , as are products of polish spaces . for @xmath2",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of permutations of @xmath4 , and by @xmath5 the set of permutations of @xmath6 with _ finite _ support .",

    "sampling @xmath9 times without replacement among @xmath10 possibly not distinct points @xmath11 corresponds to sampling from the law @xmath12 which is a continuous function ( for the weak and the total variation topologies ) of @xmath13 more precisely , @xmath14 can be written as a sum of continuous linear functions of @xmath15 for @xmath16 by an exclusion - inclusion formula .",
    "sampling @xmath9 times with replacement corresponds to using the law @xmath17 .",
    "the statements about the laws used for sampling without and with replacement are obvious .",
    "sampling from @xmath14 corresponds to sampling @xmath9 times without replacement from the atoms of @xmath18 counted with their multiplicities , and this fact clearly implies the continuity statement .",
    "more precisely , @xmath19 where the term of index @xmath20 in the sum is a continuous linear function of @xmath21 , and since @xmath22 we conclude by recurrence over @xmath23 .",
