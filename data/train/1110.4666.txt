    "phase transitions are one of most interesting phenomena that occurs in nature .",
    "many systems have phase transitions in critical regions and it is widely known that the classic ising model ( and others ) displays a second order temperature driven phase transition .",
    "in particular , phase transitions and the critical behaviors of the random field ising model ( rfim ) were studied extensively in the last years , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the rfim leads to a number of challenging problems in the physics of disordered systems@xcite .",
    "there are two basic types of disorder in spin models :    disordered bonds ( spin - glass models ) and    site disorder ( randomness of the applied magnetic field in the rfim ) .",
    "mean - field theory has been one of several techniques used to study the rfim .",
    "although the mean - field version of the rfim is much easier , there are some open questions about the behavior of the rfim with more realistic , short - rgange interactions , which still motivate experimental and theoretical investigations@xcite . the lower critical dimension and the existence of an ordered phase in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "have been rigorously established by mathematical proofs@xcite",
    ". however , the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) for a double-@xmath10 distribution of random fields , in accordance with mean - field results , is still under question ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the rfim is revelant for the description of several physical situations , as example :    for the structural phase transitions in random alloys ,    for the phase transitions in commensurate charge - density - wave systems with impurity pinning and    in binary fluid mixtures in random porous media    .",
    "random fields have been used to mimic frustration introduced by the disorder in interacting many body systems and for explaining several aspects of electronic transport in disordered insulators@xcite and in systems near the metal - insulator transition @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the physics of hysteresis , of the avalanche behavior , and of the origin of self - organized criticality @xcite , has been explained by resorting to the analysis of the non - equilibrium behavior of suitable rfim .",
    "there is a new class of problems related to the self - generated glassy behavior , which has been explained instead in terms of a spin model in infinitesimal random fields @xcite , and more recently , the rfim has been employed to describe critical behavior of amorphous magnetic systems , such as thin films and critical surface behavior of the amorphous semi - infinite systems  @xcite . in the last years",
    ", a new effective field theory ( eft ) has been used to study second - order phase transition of both classical and quantum spin models , and tricritical point in the phase diagram , which leads to useful qualitative insights for the critical behavior .",
    "the eft method uses the callen - suzuki identities@xcite as a starting point and utilizes the differential operator technique , developed by honmura and kaneyoshi@xcite .",
    "it provides a hierarchy of approximations to obtain thermodynamic properties of magnetic models .",
    "one can continue these series of aproximations considering increasing clusters which leads to better results .",
    "the exact solution would be obtained by considering an infinite cluster . however , by using relatively small clusters that contain the topology of the lattice , one can obtain a reasonable description of thermodynamic properties as it will be shown below .",
    "several spin models , such as blume - capel  @xcite , random field ising  @xcite , heisenberg  @xcite , ising metamagnet  @xcite and ising with four - spin couplings  @xcite models , have been treated by using eft . in these works",
    ", the first - order line could not be obtained due to the absence of an expression for the free energy .",
    "therefore , only second - order lines and tricritical points were analyzed .",
    "in particular , fittipaldi and kaneyoshi  @xcite have used the eft approach to study the phase diagram of the blume - capel model with spin-@xmath11 on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the position of the first - order transition was obtained from the isotherms in the @xmath12 plane ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the magnetization and the magnetic field , respectively ) applying the maxwell equal area construction .",
    "the first - order lines obtained in ref . [ 28 ] are not correct , since in the limit @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the biquadratic ( bilinear ) coupling ) at @xmath7 the exact value is @xmath18 , and the value presented in ref .",

    "our goal is to propose a functional for free energy , in order to obtain the first - order line in the phase diagram in the @xmath4 plane for the random field classical and quantum spin-@xmath20 heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : the model and formalism are developed in section ii , and the results and conclusions are discussed in section iii .",
