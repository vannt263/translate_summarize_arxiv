    "entanglement is one of the most fundamental features of quantum mechanics . besides its fascinating conceptual aspect it also plays an important role in quantum information science because entanglement of qubits is the essential requirement for quantum computing .",

    "contrary to the previous studies where the so called external approximation was used @xcite in this paper we take into account the full qubit - field interaction .",
    "the entanglement swapping was originally proposed for photons @xcite and has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently this idea has been used to demonstrate the entanglement of two single atom quantum bits each spontaneously emitting a photon @xcite . in our paper",
    "we use this idea to entangle solid state qubits which seem to be the most scalable and integrable @xcite .",
    "the process of entanglement can be described in this case by the interaction hamiltonian with controllable parameters .",

    "we investigated a mechanism for creation of entanglement of two qubits , each interacting with a single mode electromagnetic field coming from independent sources .",
    "this interaction leads to two independent entangled qubit - field states and that bsm performed on the electromagnetic field modes projects the qubits onto an entangled state .",
    "thus we discussed transfer of quantum information between systems having different physical nature and defined in hilbert spaces of different dimensions .    in the first part of the paper we have dealt with the pure states which is justified to some extent by estimated relatively long decoherence times .",

    "they can be at much larger distances as the scheme does not depend essentially on the distance between them .",
