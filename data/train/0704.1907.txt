    "agb stars are predicted to be major contributors to the enrichment of the interstellar medium in carbon , nitrogen and s - process elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath1c and s - process elements are brought to the surface of agb stars during the third dredge - up @xcite and they are then ejected into the interstellar medium by the extensive stellar winds that occur during the agb phase of evolution .",
    "the @xmath2n production is mainly from the envelopes of the more massive agb stars where the hot - bottom burning process @xcite can cycle the entire envelope through the outer parts of the hydrogen - burning shell , converting @xmath1c to @xmath2n . in the case where the @xmath1c in the envelope has",
    "a component that comes from third dredge - up , the @xmath2n resulting from the dredged - up @xmath1c is of primary origin .",
    "there is strong evidence that some of the @xmath2n in the universe is of primary origin @xcite , with the primary source dominating for metal abundances less than one third solar .",
    "hot - bottom burning in intermediate - mass ( @xmath3m@xmath0 ) agb stars is a possible source for this primary nitrogen .",
    "detailed stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations suggest that the hot - bottom burning in agb stars may also involve the ne - na and mg - al chains , leading to changes in the surface abundances of al amd mg as well as nitrogen @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all the evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations are very uncertain due to the problem of treating convection , especially the critical process of convective overshoot .",
    "observational constraints from intermediate - mass agb stars are required to constrain the convection parameters such as mixing length and overshoot distance , which are critical to the nucleosynthesis results .",
    "this study was initiated to provide such constraints .",
    "considerable numbers of intermediate - mass agb stars are known in the magellanic clouds ( wood , bessell & fox 1983 ) , and these stars can be used to provide the observational tests required for the evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "some work has been done in this area by @xcite who examined the c , n and o abundances in a sample of luminous agb stars in the lmc .",
    "they found that @xmath2n was enhanced in a way consistent with first dredge - up only , without the need for hot - bottom burning .",
    "however , the stars studied by @xcite were not known variable stars , meaning that they were not near the end of their agb evolution where the effects of dredge - up and hot - bottom burning should be most pronounced . in addition",
    ", the lack of pulsation means that there was no way to estimate the mass of the stars involved .    in this study , we have aimed to get surface abundances for a small sample of intermediate - mass , pulsating agb stars .",
    "these stars are near the end of their agb evolution and are about to enter their final superwind stage where most of the material currently in their envelopes will be ejected back into the interstellar medium ( in fact , two of the stars are iras sources already exhibiting strong superwinds ) .",
    "since they are pulsating , we can also estimate their current masses from pulsation theory .",
    "on the other hand , because of their low effective temperatures and their pulsation , the model atmospheres required for the interpretation of their spectra are complicated and difficult , and must involve the dynamics of the atmosphere .    in section [ sec : observations ]",
    ", we describe the sample of stars and the photometry and spectra obtained for them . in section [ sec : pulsation ] , we describe the pulsation models , in section [ sec : modelatmos ] the model atmospheres are described and the derived abundances are given .",
    "the results are discussed in the final section .",
    "the sample of objects observed in this study is given in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "all these stars are oxygen - rich , pulsating , luminous agb stars .",
    "all the stars have been monitored in @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the anu 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory , using either a single channel photometer ( prior to march 1994 ) or the infrared array caspir @xcite.the mean bolometric luminosity @xmath6 of each star was derived from the @xmath7 photometry and monitoring , using the bolometric corrections from @xcite with @xmath8 = -0.3 $ ] and -0.6 for the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "distance modulii of 18.54 and 18.93 and reddenings",
    "e(b - v ) of 0.08 and 0.12 were assumed for the lmc and smc , respectively ( keller and wood 2006 ) .",
    "the least evolved of the stars in table [ tab : sample ] , with lowest luminosity , smallest amplitude and shortest pulsation period , is the most luminous red giant in the lmc cluster ngc1866 . at the other extreme",
    "are two iras sources with very long pulsation periods and large amplitudes .",
    "the luminosities and periods of the stars in the sample mean that their current masses lie in the range 38 m@xmath0 @xcite .",
    ".the intermediate - mass agb star sample [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our final derived abundances are shown in table [ tab : abundances ] .",
    "for the elements fe , na , al , sc , ti , and n , the error estimates in the table are those arising from the fit to the line only , as only one line was available .",
    "they are eye - estimates based on the fits 0.15 dex above and below the adopted optimum fit abundance .",
    "the c and o values are based on averages of the fits to 6 and 4 lines , respectively , with the stated errors being based on the standard deviation .",
    "the lines used are given in table [ tab : spectrallines ] .",
    "systematic errors , such as errors in the pulsation model and its phase , will undoubtedly add significantly to the fit error , but such additional errors are hard to estimate .",

    "this has made abundance derivation with our atmosphere code impossible .",
    "[ fig : gm103_m119467_k4308 ] shows a sample of the spectrum for each star , along with an attempt at synthesisizing the spectrum using the pulsation models from section  [ sec : pulsation ] .    in the case of gm103 ,",
    "the synthesized absorption lines are much stronger than the observed lines .",
    "a comparison of the observed and synthesisized spectra shows clearly that the observed line cores are filled in by strong emission in every case .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that each line is split into a pre- and post - shock absorption component , with no emission in the middle .",
    "however , the weakness of the observed absorption lines compared to the model lines suggests that there is indeed a strong emission component . in hv11303 ,",
    "the lines are much broader than in gm103 , with evidence for an emission component as well as absorption components corresponding to the pre- and post - shock velocities .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : pulsation ] , the spectral synthesis code ignores the immediate post - shock , high - temperature region so that there is no post - shock emission component in our synthesized spectra .",
    "when a strong shock is present in the atmosphere , this model deficiency prevents abundance determination from lines which have a post - shock emission contribution .",
    "these results show that observations useful for abundance analysis must be obtained at phases of the pulsation cycle when no strong shock wave is present in the atmosphere . in these relatively massive stars ,",
    "the shock wave enters the lower part of the stellar atmosphere near minimum of the @xmath5 light curve , or phase @xmath110.20.3 past minimum visual light .",

    "[ fig : finalabundances ] . the fe abundance is close to half solar , consistent with the values obtained by @xcite , @xcite and other studies of young objects in the lmc .",
    "the other metal abundances are similarly near half - solar , except for ti in hv2576 where our derived value seems anomalously low .",
    "the cno abundances are the most interesting part of this study , since in a highly - evolved , intermediate - mass agb star they will be altered by the 1st , 2nd and 3rd dredge - ups and by hot - bottom burning .",
    "evidence for hot - bottom burning has been found in intermediate - mass agb stars in the magellanic clouds by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined spectra of 7 luminous agb stars in the smc and found them to be li - rich , c - poor and with low @xmath1c/@xmath12c ratios , consistent with hot - bottom burning .",
    "@xcite examined a large number of smc and lmc stars and found many luminous agb stars , including hv2576 , showed strong li lines that could be attributed to hot - bottom burning .",
    "in fact , hv2576 had the largest estimated li abundance of all the stars examined .",
    "@xcite examined li lines in the giant stars in ngc1866 and found that ngc1866#4 ( which they mislabel as # 2 ) had enhanced li compared to other stars in the cluster , indicating that hot - bottom burning is operating in this star also .",
    "there is evidence that the third dredge - up has been operating in hv2576 , as well as hot - bottom burning . @xcite",
    "give a spectral type m5.5/s1 for hv2576 , indicating the presence of excess zro in the spectrum , which is a result of the dredge - up of s - process elements during thermal pulses .",
    "@xcite noted that hv2576 had one of the strongest zro bands in their large sample of stars , indicating that a large amount of third dredge - up has occurred in this star .",
    "the combination of third dredge - up and hot - bottom burning is predicted to be a significant source of primary nitrogen in the universe .",
    "the @xmath1c dredged up at a thermal pulse is converted into @xmath2n during the next interpulse period when hot - bottom burning operates during the quiescent h - shell burning phase . @xcite and @xcite ( see their figs . 2.37 and 5.6 , respectively )",
    "show the effects of third dredge - up and hot - bottom burning in intermediate - mass , luminous and sub - solar metallicity agb stars such as those we are dealing with here .",
    "initially on the agb , just at the onset of thermal pulses , hot - bottom burning by the cn cycle reduces the @xmath1c abundance to @xmath111/15 of its initial main - sequence value , and increases the @xmath2n abundance to @xmath115 - 6 times its initial value .",
    "the ratio @xmath1c/@xmath2n at this time is @xmath111/15 . during subsequent evolution ,",
    "the dredge - up of @xmath1c by third dredge - up at thermal pulses , followed by hot - bottom burning , causes a steady rise over many pulsation cycles in both the c and n abundance , with the c / n ratio remaining almost constant at @xmath111/15 . during this relatively long evolutionary process , there is a small decrease in the o abundance , but this effect would be too small for us to reliably detect .    looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : finalabundances ] and table  [ tab : abundances ] , we see that the c abundance in both ngc1866#4 and hv2576 is about 0.1 times half - solar . at the same time , the n abundance is @xmath1110 times the half - solar value .",
    "both these numbers are consistent with the strong operation of hot - bottom burning in the envelopes of these stars .",
    "furthermore , the very large n abundances can only be explained by hot - bottom processing of dredged - up @xmath1c into @xmath2n i.e. a large fraction of the nitrogen in the envelopes of these stars must be of primary origin .",
    "this is the first direct demonstration that this long - predicted source of primary nitrogen does exist .",
    "the o abundance in hv2576 is essentially unchanged from the half - solar value , as predicted by models .",
    "there is some evidence for an increase in the o abundance in ngc1866#4 .",
    "if confirmed , this would lend support to convective theories such as that of @xcite which lead to overshoot at convective boundaries , enrichment of the intershell region in both @xmath1c and @xmath9o at each helium shell flash , and subsequent dredge - up of both @xmath1c and @xmath9o in third dredge - up events .",
    "a strong disagreement between the observations and evolutionary models without convective overshoot relates to the total stellar mass required for the efficient operation of hot - bottom burning .",
    "the mass of ngc1866#4 must be no more than @xmath114 m@xmath0 because of cluster membership .",
    "this star shows evidence for efficient hot - bottom burning , while models without convective overshoot do not predict efficient hot - bottom burning at masses this low .",
    "this suggests that overshoot ( inwards ) of convective material at convective boundaries is required to significantly extends the convective envelope into nuclear - burning regions .",
    "the models of @xcite use a convective theory that does produce overshoot , and their 4 m@xmath0 , half - solar metal abundance agb models do have the efficient hot - bottom burning observed in ngc1866#4 . at 6 m@xmath0 , both the observations of hv2576 and models with or without convective overshoot show efficient hot - bottom burning .",
    "the elements li , na and al can also be compared with evolutionary models . @xcite give a(li ) = 3.8 for hv2576 while @xcite give a(li ) = 1.5 ( note that these authors used static model atmospheres , and observations at random phases where shocks may have been present in the stellar atmosphere ) .",
    "models of agb stars with efficient hot - bottom burning generally show an initial large increase in the surface li abundance , after which it slowly decreases to low values ( a(li ) @xmath13 1.0 ) while the cn cycle converts c into n - see @xcite and @xcite . the high li value derived for hv2576 , together with the observed high @xmath2n and low @xmath1c abundances , is consistent with model predictions for a 6 m@xmath0 star about one quarter of the way through its tpagb phase and undergoing efficient hot - bottom burning - see fig .",
    "c27 of @xcite .",
    "the na and al abundances found in this study are marginally below the expected half - solar values and within the expected range of observed variation .",
    "models of agb stars @xcite with efficient hot - bottom burning show a small increase in al abundance and small changes in the total mg abundance but these are too small to detect here .",
    "the @xmath14mg/@xmath15 mg ratio can increase greatly in such stars , but we are unable to detect isotopic changes .",
    "high - dispersion , near - infrared spectra have been used to derive abundances of luminous , intermediate - mass agb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the c and n abundances derived here provide the first observational demonstration that third dredge - up at thermal pulses followed by hot - bottom burning can produce significant amounts of primary nitrogen in intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "the observed spectra and modelling show that only spectra taken during the part of the pulsation cycle near minimum visual light , equivalent to the latter part of the decline of the @xmath5 light curve , are useful for abundance analysis .",
    "the results in this paper come from exploratory observations and calculations and , in the end , only two stars were suitable for abundance analysis .",
    "it is clear that follow - up work with a larger sample of objects is required to confirm the results found here , and to seek c and n abundances as a function of stellar mass , luminosity and metal abundance .",
