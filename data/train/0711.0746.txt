    "over the past decade , cosmological n - body simulations have shown consistently that equilibrium dark matter halos have spherically - averaged mass density profiles which are approximately `` universal '' in form ; i.e. , their shape is independent of mass , of the values of the cosmological parameters , and of the linear power spectrum from which nonlinear structures have grown . as a result , it is useful to parametrize halo profiles by simple empirical formulae , such as that proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the critical density for closure and its present - day value as @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13.[ftn : hz ] ] , @xmath14 is a characteristic density contrast , and @xmath15 is a scale radius .",
    "note that this formula contains two scale parameters but no adjustable shape parameter .    as discussed in some detail by nfw and confirmed by subsequent numerical work",
    ", the two parameters of the nfw profile do not take arbitrary values , but are instead correlated in a way that reflects the mass - dependence of halo assembly times ( e.g. , kravtsov , klypin & khokhlov 1997 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "1999 ; jing 2000 ; ghigna et al . 2000",
    "; bullock et al . 2001 ; eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 ; klypin et al .",
    "the basic idea behind this interpretation is that the characteristic density of a halo tracks the mean density of the universe at the time of its formation .",
    "thus , the later a halo is assembled , the lower its characteristic density , @xmath14 , or , equivalently , its `` concentration '' ( see section  [ ssec : hcat ] for a definition ) .    although the general validity of these trends is well established , a definitive account of the redshift and mass dependence of halo concentration is still lacking , even for the current concordance cosmology .",
    "this is especially true at high masses , where enormous simulation volumes are required in order to collect statistically significant samples of these rare systems .",
    "simulating large cosmological volumes with good mass resolution is a major computational challenge , and until recently our understanding of the mass profile of massive halos has been rather limited , derived largely from small numbers of individual realizations or from extrapolation of models calibrated on different mass scales ( nfw ; moore et al .",

    "2005 ) .",
    "individual halo simulations may result in biased concentration estimates , depending on the specific selection criteria used to set them up .",
    "in addition , they are unlikely to capture the full scatter resulting from the rich variety of possible halo formation histories . extrapolation based on poorly tested models",
    "can also produce substantial errors , as recently demonstrated by neto et al .",
    "these authors analyzed the mass - concentration relation for halos identified at @xmath5 in the _ millennium simulation _ of springel et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter ms ) and confirmed the earlier conclusion of zhao et al .",
    "( 2003b ) that the models of bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter b01 ) and eke et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter ens ) ( which were calibrated to match galaxy - sized halos ) severely underestimate the average concentration of massive clusters , by up to a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "estimates of concentrations can also be biased by the inclusion of unrelaxed halos .",
    "these often have irregular density profiles caused by major substructures .",
    "smooth density profiles are often poor fits to such halos , and the resulting concentration estimates are ill - defined because they depend on the radial range of the fit and choice of weighting .",
    "they can also lead to spurious correlations ( see for example figure  9 of neto et al .",
    "2007 ) . consequently , in this paper we follow neto et al . and select only relaxed halos for analysis .",
    "this is not without its own problems .",
    "such selection biases against recently formed halos , which may preferentially have lower concentrations .",
    "however we believe this is preferable to polluting the sample with meaningless concentration estimates of the kind that arise when smooth spherical models are force - fit to lumpy , multi - modal mass distributions .",
    "hayashi & white ( 2008 ) stacked _ all _ halos , regardless of dynamical state , in the ms and studied the resulting mean profiles as a function of halo mass .",
    "the relatively small differences between their results and those found below shows that the inclusion of unrelaxed halos has rather little effect in the mean .",
    "a further preoccupation concerns indications that halo profiles deviate slightly but systematically from the nfw model ( moore et al .",
    "1998 , jing & suto 2000 , fukushige & makino 2001 , navarro et al .",
    "2004 , prada et al .",
    "2006 , merritt et al .",
    "2006 ) , raising the possibility that estimating concentrations by force - fitting simple formulae to numerical data may result in subtle biases that could mask the real trends .",
    "this is especially important because of hints that such deviations depend systematically on halo mass ( navarro et al .",
    "2004 , merritt et al .",
    "evaluating and correcting for such deviations is important in order to establish conclusively the mass and redshift dependence of halo concentration .",
    "these uncertainties are unfortunate since observations , especially at high redshift , often focus on exceptional systems .",
    "for example , massive galaxy clusters are readily identified in large - scale surveys of the distant universe , and understanding their internal structure will be critical for the correct interpretation of cluster surveys intending to constrain the nature of dark energy .",
    "these will make precise measurements of the evolution of cluster abundance in samples detected by gravitational lensing , by their optical or x - ray emission , or through the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( see , e.g. , carlstrom et al .",
    "2002 , hu 2003 , majumdar & mohr 2003 , holder 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "there is at present no _ ab initio _ theory that can reliably predict the internal structure of cdm halos .",
    "the models of zhao et al ( 2003a ) , wechsler et al ( 2002 ) ( see also lu et al .",
    "2006 ) are interesting , but as shown in neto et al ( 2007 ) they account for only a small fraction in the measured dispersion in concentration at a fixed mass .",
    "there is currently no substitute for direct numerical simulation when detailed predictions are needed for comparison with observation .",
    "we address these issues here by combining results from the ms with results from an additional simulation which followed a substantially smaller volume but with better mass resolution .",
    "this allows us to extend the range of halo masses for which we can measure concentrations and to assess how these measures are affected by numerical resolution .",
    "our analysis procedure follows closely that of neto et al .",
    "in particular , we concentrate in this paper on the properties of halos which are relaxed according to the criteria defined by these authors ; mean density profiles for _ all _ ms halos of given mass , regardless of dynamical state , are presented by hayashi & white ( 2008 ) .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : numexp ] by describing briefly the numerical simulations and the halo catalogue on which this study is based . in section  [ sec : res ]",
    "we present our main results for the dependence of profile shape and concentration on halo mass and redshift .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion and summary in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the analysis presented here is based primarily on halos identified in the _ millennium simulation _ ( ms ) of springel et al .",
    "the halo identification and cataloguing procedure follows closely that described in detail by neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for completeness , we here recapitulate the main aspects of the procedure , referring the interested reader to the earlier papers for details .      the ms is a large n - body simulation of the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmogony .",
    "it follows @xmath17 particles in a periodic box of side @xmath18 .",
    "the chosen cosmological parameters were @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the present - day contribution of each component to the matter - energy density of the universe , expressed in units of the critical density for closure , @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the spectral index of the primordial density fluctuations , and @xmath28 is the rms linear mass fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath29 mpc at @xmath5 .",
    "the particle mass in the ms is @xmath30 .",
    "particle interactions are softened on scales smaller than the ( plummer - equivalent ) softening length , @xmath31 .",
    "we also use a second simulation of a smaller volume ( @xmath32 mpc@xmath33 ) within the same cosmological model .",
    "this simulation followed @xmath34 particles of mass @xmath35 and softened interactions on scales smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "it thus has approximately 9 times better mass resolution than the ms .",
    "hereafter we refer to it as the hms .",
    "our halo cataloguing procedure starts from a standard @xmath37 friends - of - friends list of particle groups ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) and refines it with the help of subfind , the _ subhalo finder _",
    "algorithm described by springel et al .",
    "each halo is centred at the location of the minimum of the gravitational potential of its main subfind subhalo , and this centre is used to compute the virial radius and mass of each halo .",
    "we define the virial radius , @xmath38 , as that of a sphere of mean density @xmath39 .",
    "note that this defines implicitly the `` virial mass '' of the halo , @xmath40 , as that enclosed within @xmath38 .",
    "the choice of @xmath41 varies in the literature .",
    "the most popular choices are : ( i ) a fixed value , as in nfw s original work , where @xmath42 was adopted ; or ( ii ) a value motivated by the spherical top - hat collapse model , where @xmath43 for a flat universe ( eke et al .",
    "the latter choice gives @xmath44 at @xmath5 for the cosmological parameters adopted for the ms .",
    "we keep track of both definitions in our halo catalogue , and will specify our choice by a subscript . thus , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mass and radius of a halo adopting @xmath42 , whereas @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the values corresponding to @xmath44 at @xmath5 .",
    "quantities specified without subscript assume @xmath42 , so that , e.g. , @xmath49 . the halo concentration is defined as the ratio between the virial radius and the scale radius : @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", the characteristic density is related to the concentration by @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{eq : cdeltac}\\ ] ]    since halos are dynamically evolving structures , we use a combination of diagnostics in order to flag non - equilibrium systems . following neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we assess the equilibrium state of each halo by measuring : ( i ) the * substructure mass fraction * ; i.e. , the total mass fraction in resolved substructures whose centres lie within @xmath46 , @xmath52 ; ( ii ) the * centre of mass displacement * , @xmath53 , defined as the normalized offset between the location of the minimum of the potential and the barycentre of the mass within @xmath46 ; and ( iii ) the * virial ratio * , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total kinetic energy of the halo particles within @xmath48 and @xmath56 their gravitational self - potential energy .    using these criteria",
    ", we shall consider halos to be _ relaxed _ if they satisfy _ all _ the following conditions : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "( see neto et al .",
    "2007 for full details . )",
    "we shall also impose a minimum number of particles in order to be able to say something meaningful about internal halo structure .",
    "we initially set this limit at 500 particles , but following the analysis of profile shapes presented in section  3.2 we subsequently adopt a stricter criterion of 3000 particles .",
    "we consider only _ relaxed _ halos in this study , since only for such systems can the mass profiles of individual objects be represented accurately by a simple fitting formula with a small number of parameters .",
    "such formulae are also useful for characterizing the _ average _ profiles of large ensembles of halos , since the fluctuations in the individual systems then average out .",
    "hayashi & white ( 2007 ) present such mean profiles as a function of mass for all ms halos regardless of their dynamical state .",
    "we compare their results with our own below .    with these restrictions , including the 3000 particle limit , our final ms catalogue contains @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 relaxed halos at @xmath5 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively . ( the corresponding numbers for the hms catalogue are @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . ) the overall fractions of these halos that are relaxed in the ms are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 at these redshifts , respectively .",
    "we note that these fractions also depend on halo mass : at @xmath5 about @xmath75 of @xmath76 halos are relaxed by our criteria , but only @xmath77 of @xmath78 halos . in order to obtain usefully large statistical samples ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to the redshift range @xmath9 in the following .",
    "for each halo in the samples described in section  [ sec : numexp ] we have computed a spherically - averaged density profile by measuring the halo mass in @xmath79 equal intervals of @xmath80 over the range @xmath81 .",
    "profiles may also be stacked in order to obtain an _ average _ profile for halos of similar mass .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of erasing individual deviations from a smooth profile which are typically due to the presence of substructure .",
    "such deviations increase the ( already considerable ) scatter in the parameters fitted to individual profiles and may mask underlying trends in the data .",
    "the left panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] show the profile that results from stacking @xmath82 halos of mass @xmath83 identified at @xmath5 in the ms .",
    "we choose to show @xmath84 vs @xmath85 rather than @xmath86 vs @xmath85 in order to remove the main radial trend and enhance the dynamic range of the plot .",
    "similar stacked profiles for _ all _ halos in the ms ( regardless of dynamical state ) are shown by hayashi & white ( 2008 ) .",
    "the concentration of a halo is defined using the scale radius of the profile , @xmath15 .",
    "this identifies the location of the maximum of the @xmath87 profile .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] , the peak is rather broad , leading to some uncertainty in its exact location when noise is present .",
    "typically this problem is addressed by fitting the numerical data to some specified functional form over an extended radial range .",
    "the curves in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] show the result of fitting the stacked halo profile with the nfw formula ( eq .  ( [ eq : nfw ] ) ) , but varying the radial range of the fit as shown by the labels .",
    "this results in slightly different estimates for @xmath15 , and consequently for the concentration , @xmath88 .",
    "increasing the innermost radius of the fit from @xmath89 to @xmath90 results in a concentration estimate that decreases from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "this variation is a result of the slight ( but significant ) mismatch between the _ shape _ of the nfw profile and that of the stacked halo , as shown by the residuals in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] .",
    "the `` s '' shape of the residuals implies that the stacked profile steepens more gradually with radius in a log - log plot than does the nfw profile , a result that has been discussed in detail by navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , prada et al . ( 2006 ) and merritt et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "these results suggest that force - fitting nfw profiles may induce spurious correlations between mass and concentration .",
    "in particular , when halos are identified in a single cosmological simulation , the numerical resolution varies systematically with halo mass ( less massive halos are more poorly resolved ) so that the radial range available for fitting is a strong function of halo mass .",
    "one way to address this issue is to adopt a fitting formula that better matches the mean profile of simulated halos . as discussed by navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , prada et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and merritt et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , improved fits are obtained adopting a radial density law where the logarithmic slope is a power - law of radius , @xmath93 which implies a density law of the form @xmath94 .",
    "\\label{eq : rhoalpha}\\ ] ] here @xmath95 is the density at @xmath96 .",
    "this density law was first introduced by einasto ( 1965 ) who used it to describe the distribution of old stars within the milky way . for convenience",
    ", we will thus refer to it as the einasto profile .",
    "note that according to our definition , @xmath97 corresponds to the radius where the logarithmic slope of the density profile has the `` isothermal '' value , @xmath98 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath97 is equivalent to the nfw scale - length , @xmath15 , and again marks the location of the maximum in the @xmath84 profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] .",
    "the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] shows that , at the cost of introducing an extra shape parameter , the fits improve to the point that the sensitivity of concentration estimates to the fitted radial range is effectively eliminated .",
    "thus , concentrations obtained by fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoalpha ] ) to the stacked halo profiles are robust against variations in fitting details .",
    "hayashi & white ( 2007 ) show that the same is true for fits to stacks of _ all _ halos of a given mass , rather than just the relaxed halos used to make fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] , and indeed , the @xmath2 and @xmath99 values they find are very similar to the values we obtain here , showing that our restriction to relaxed halos has relatively little effect in the mean .",
    "we conclude that accounting for the subtle difference between halo profile shape and the nfw fitting formula is worthwhile in order to avoid possible fitting - induced biases in concentration estimates . in the remainder of this paper we quote concentrations , @xmath100 , which are estimated by fitting density profiles by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoalpha ] ) .",
    "we discuss in the next section how @xmath2 is chosen for these fits .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the shape parameter , @xmath2 , should be used to improve the description of the typical density profiles of simulated halos and to eliminate possible biases in estimates of their concentration . to do this",
    ", it is necessary to understand whether ( and how ) @xmath2 varies with redshift and/or halo mass .",
    "we explore this in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphamz ] .",
    "the left panel shows how the best - fit value of @xmath2 depends on halo mass for the average profiles of relaxed halos stacked according to their mass .",
    "we consider only halos with at least @xmath101 particles within the virial radius , and stacks containing at least @xmath102 halos .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in this plot correspond to the ms and hms simulations , respectively .",
    "this figure illustrates several interesting points . in the first place",
    ", we note that there is good agreement between the two simulations for halos which are represented by at least 3000 particles , but that systematic differences are visible when the ms halos contain fewer particles than this . in the rest of this paper we will thus only present results for halos containing at least 3000 particles within the virial radius .",
    "a second interesting point is that there are well - defined trends for @xmath2 to increase with mass at each redshift , and with redshift at each mass . the ( weak ) trend with mass was already visible in navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and merritt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , although the small number of halos in these studies made their results rather inconclusive in the face of the large halo - to - halo scatter . the use of stacked profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphamz ] , together with the much larger number of halos in the simulations used here , leads to a far more convincing demonstration of the trends than was previously possible .",
    "the trend with redshift at given mass may seem surprising , but its interpretation is made clear by the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alphamz ] . here",
    "we show @xmath2 as a function of a dimensionless `` peak - height '' parameter , defined as @xmath103 ; i.e. , as the ratio of the linear density threshold for collapse at @xmath104 to the rms linear density fluctuation at @xmath104 within spheres of mean enclosed mass @xmath105 .",
    "the parameter @xmath106 is related to the abundance of objects of mass @xmath105 at redshift @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath107 defines the characteristic mass , @xmath108 , of the halo mass distribution at redshift @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath109 then corresponds to rare objects with @xmath110 , while @xmath111 corresponds to objects in the low - mass tail of the distribution .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 plays a key role in the press - schechter model for the growth of nonlinear structure ( see , for example , lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alphamz ] shows that all curves coincide when expressed in terms of @xmath106 ( and when considering halos with @xmath113 particles ) .",
    "thus , the redshift dependence in the left panel merely reflects the fact that objects of given virial mass correspond to very different values of @xmath112 at different redshifts .",
    "it is interesting that the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath112 is very weak for @xmath114 ( it is nearly constant at @xmath115 ) , but it increases rapidly for rarer , more massive objects , reaching @xmath116 for @xmath117 . a simple formula",
    ", @xmath118 describes the numerical results quite accurately .",
    "taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , austin et al ( 2005 ) and dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) investigated a halo model based on the assumption that the phase space density , @xmath119 , was a simple powerlaw of radius .",
    "interestingly , the density profile they found is almost identical to an einasto profile with @xmath120 and so the sharp upturn we find in @xmath2 at @xmath121 could be taken as indication that such a model is not valid for rare and massive halos .",
    "the dependence of profile shape on @xmath112 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rhonu ] , where we plot @xmath84 profiles for halo stacks corresponding to three different values of @xmath112 : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the larger @xmath112 , the larger @xmath2 , and the more sharply the profile peaks .",
    "it is unclear what causes these systematic trends , but the fact that they depend on @xmath112 ( rather than , say , on mass alone ) is an important clue for models that attempt to explain the near - universality of dark halo density profiles .",
    "while our results here are based purely on relaxed halos , very similar results were found by hayashi & white ( 2007 ) for the average profiles of stacks of _ all _ ms halos , regardless of dynamical state .",
    "as we discussed above , a fitting formula other than nfw is needed to obtain concentration estimates that are insensitive to the radial range fitted .",
    "einasto s profile , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoalpha ] ) , accomplishes this at the cost of introducing an additional shape parameter , @xmath2 . adjusting @xmath2 to fit",
    "the detailed structure of individual halos would negate the spirit of the nfw programme which attempts to predict the structure of dark halos in any hierarchical cosmology from its initial power spectrum and the global cosmological parameters .",
    "three - parameter fits to individual halos are also susceptible to strongly correlated parameter errors . we have therefore explored whether fixing @xmath2 as a function of halo mass and redshift according to the @xmath125 relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphanu ] ) results in significantly different concentration distributions than adjusting it freely to fit each halo .",
    "we show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : resid ] , which shows concentration distributions for the @xmath82 individual halos which were stacked to make fig .",
    "[ fig : r2rho ] .",
    "we compare the distribution obtained from full three - parameter einasto fits to that obtained when @xmath2 is set to the value predicted for each halo from its mass .",
    "we find that for most halos the fits give essentially the same concentration , and the distributions of concentration are almost indistinguishable .",
    "the medians of the fixed-@xmath2 and floating-@xmath2 distributions are @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively",
    ". the scatters also coincide , as noted in the labels of fig .",
    "[ fig : resid ] .",
    "interestingly , the scatter around the best - fit profile is typically only slightly smaller for the einasto model than for the nfw model , showing that the difference between the two models is much smaller than the deviation of the profile of typical individual halos from either model . in this sense",
    ", the 3-parameter einasto profile has little advantage over the 2-parameter nfw profile when estimating dark matter halo concentrations .",
    "this is easily understood . estimating the concentration of a halo is equivalent to locating the `` peak '' of the @xmath84 profile .",
    "provided that the shape of the fitted profile is , on average , a good approximation to the simulated ones , no systematic offset is expected between concentrations estimated using the two procedures .",
    "we conclude that concentrations may be estimated robustly by fitting einasto profiles to individual halos with @xmath2 fixed to the value obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphanu ] ) .",

    "the concentration - mass relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmz ] for @xmath128 and @xmath66 .",

    "the differences are small , as may be judged from the power - law fit proposed by neto et al . , @xmath131 , shown as a dotted line in the upper - left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : cmz ] .",
    "this power law fit is very similar ( after correction for differing concentration and mass definitions ) to that which maccio et al .",
    "( 2007 ) obtained from nfw fits to halos in an independent set of ( smaller ) simulations , despite the fact that these authors included halos with as few as 250 particles , which we would consider to be significantly under - resolved on the basis of our own tests .",
    "both the concentration values and the trends with mass and redshift are very similar to those presented in figure  2 of zhao et al ( 2003b ) who analysed a set of @xmath0cdm simulations of varying resolution .",
    "the small offsets between their mean concentrations and our results are consistent with the slight differences we have noted when switching from nfw to einasto models for determining concentrations .",
    "in addition to confirming these earlier results , the much larger volume of our simulations results in a better determination of the intrinsic scatter about the mean relation .",
    "red and black symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmz ] correspond to the ms and hms simulations , respectively , with dots plotted at the median concentration for each mass bin .",
    "boxes represent the lower and upper quartiles of the concentration distributions , while the whiskers show their 5% and 95% tails .",
    "we also show the concentrations predicted by three previously proposed analytic models : nfw ( solid - dotted magenta ) , b01 ( dot - dashed black ) , ens ( dashed green ) . as discussed by neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , none of these models reproduces the simulation results over the full mass range accessible at @xmath5 : the nfw and ens models underestimate the concentration of galaxy - sized halos , whereas the b01 model fails dramatically at the high - mass end , where it predicts a sharp decline which is not seen in the simulations . to characterize the shape of the linear power spectrum .",
    "we use @xmath132 here since that provides the best fit to the _ actual _ power spectrum used in the ms . for b01",
    "we have used the default values advocated in the latest version of their software ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 in their notation ) , which is available from http://www.physics.uci.edu/@xmath135bullock / cvir/. the differences between the predictions shown here and in fig .  4 of hayashi & white ( 2008 ) , or in neto et al ( 2007 ) , for example , are due to slight differences in the values chosen for these parameters . ]",
    "there is a hint in the @xmath5 panel that the relation is flattening at the high - mass end , where the nfw predictions at @xmath5 appear slightly better than those of ens .",
    "this is because a constant concentration for very rare and massive objects is _ implicit _ in the nfw model , which assumes that the characteristic density of a halo reflects that of the universe at the time it collapsed .",

    "the near - constant concentration of the most massive halos is considerably more obvious at higher redshift , presumably because well - resolved halos ( i.e. , those with @xmath113 in the ms or hms ) become rarer and rarer with increasing lookback time . indeed , whereas at @xmath5 our ms halo catalogue spans the range @xmath136 , at @xmath137 all the halos retained have @xmath138 . as a result , the average concentration at @xmath137 is almost independent of mass over the accessible mass range , i.e. , @xmath139 .",
    "it is interesting that the average concentration of the most massive halos ( i.e. @xmath140 ) is similar at all redshifts , @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",

    "the original nfw model shows a flattening of the concentration - mass relation with increasing redshift , similar to that observed in the simulations , but it predicts insufficient evolution in concentration at given mass . as a result , this model overestimates the concentrations by an increasing amount with increasing redshift , about 40% at @xmath143 .",
    "the ens and b01 models fail to reproduce the features of the mass - concentration - redshift relations at high mass , predicting a stronger mass dependence and much more evolution than is seen . in these two models ,",
    "the concentration of halos of given mass scales inversely as the expansion factor , so that shape of the mass - concentration relation remains fixed . while the high - mass discrepancy between the b01 model and our measurements can be reduced by changing the parameters to @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( see wechsler et al 2006 ) , neither for this model nor for the ens model can parameter changes produce agreement with the weak redshift evolution seen at high mass both here and by zhao et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "on the other hand , the ens and b01 models predict the concentration evolution of galaxy mass halos substantially better than the nfw model .",

    "[ fig : cmz ] .",
    "this modified nfw model succeeds well in matching the redshift evolution , but its mass dependence is still too shallow at @xmath5 and too steep at @xmath143 , leaving room for improvement , especially at low masses where the b01 and ens prescriptions give better predictions of the evolution rate . we have checked that the same model also gives an acceptable fit for other cosmologies , in particular for a simulation of a @xmath0cdm model similar to hms but with the values of the cosmological parameters inferred from the 3-year wmap satellite data ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) .",

    "( [ eq : cdeltac ] ) ) , this implies that the characteristic densities of such halos are underestimated by at least an order of magnitude by the latter two models , leading to dramatic changes in the expected lensing power , x - ray luminosity , and s - z detectability of massive clusters at high redshift .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the @xmath5 concentration - mass relation found here to the one which hayashi & white ( 2007 ) obtained by fitting einasto profiles to stacks of _ all _ halos of a given mass , rather than to stacks of relaxed halos .",

    "thus , the restriction to relaxed halos has little systematic effect on einasto - based concentrations at masses above about @xmath162 , but at lower masses it results in somewhat larger concentrations .",

    "the median of their nfw - based concentrations is also closer to the nfw model prediction on galaxy scales ( both for relaxed and for all halos ) than is the median of the einasto - based concentrations which we plot in fig .",

    "neto et al . ( 2007 ) , hayashi & white ( 2007 ) and this paper are all based on the same simulations ( although hayashi & white do not use the hms ) .",
    "the small but ( statistically ) significant differences in their derived concentration - mass relations show that at the 10 to 20% level these relations depend on the details of the halo sample selection and profile fitting procedures .",
    "the * modified * nfw model works reasonably well over the full range of mass and redshift studied here , certainly rather better than the revisions proposed by ens and b01 .",
    "significant discrepancies remain , however , notably at galaxy masses where the nfw model underpredicts the rate of evolution , resulting in systematically low einasto - based concentrations at @xmath163 and systematically high values at @xmath164 . for such objects the evolution _ rate _",
    "is better predicted by the ens and b01 models . given the good agreement between various simulations on this mass scale ( see , e.g. , zhao et al 2003b , macci et al . 2007 and neto et al .",
    "2007 ) , we believe these concentration estimates for low redshift @xmath0cdm galaxy halos to be accurate .",
    "this implies that the nfw model needs further improvement for such objects . at higher masses and higher redshifts , however , the ( modified )",
    "nfw formalism works quite well , and should be preferred to those of b01 or ens .    with our modified parameters ,",
    "the nfw prescription not only fits concentrations in the wmap1 cosmology investigated here , but also our ( less extensive ) set of data for the wmap3 cosmology . without detailed testing",
    ", however , it is unclear if the prescription can be extended to other regimes of interest .",
    "for example , what concentrations are expected for dwarf galaxy halos or for `` first object '' halos at @xmath165 ?",
    "the incorrect conclusions reached by applying the b01 and ens formulae to massive clusters at high redshift are testimony to the dangers of using empirical formulae outside the range where they have been tested .",
    "clearly , further theoretical effort aimed at understanding the factors which determine the internal structure of dark halos would be a welcome complement to the numerical work presented here .",
    "we have used data from the _ millennium simulation _ and from a smaller but higher resolution simulation to examine how the density profiles of relaxed @xmath0cdm halos vary with halo mass and redshift .",
    "we study profile shape and concentration for halos with mass exceeding @xmath166 over the redshift range @xmath9 .",
    "our main results may be summarized as follows .",
    "* we confirm the conclusion of previous studies that , in the mean , the shape of spherically averaged @xmath0cdm halo density profiles deviates slightly but systematically from the two - parameter fitting formula proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "a more accurate description is provided by the three - parameter einasto ( 1965 ) profile , for which the logarithmic slope is a power - law of radius , @xmath167 .",
    "we show that this fitting formula gives concentration estimates which are insensitive to the radial range fitted , albeit at the price of an additional shape parameter .",
    "although einasto fits avoid small but significant biases that arise if all halos are fit to the nfw model , we emphasise that individual halos typically deviate from either model by more than the difference between them . * using stacked profiles of halos of similar mass , we show that the shape parameter , @xmath2 , depends systematically on halo mass and on redshift .",
    "these dependences can be collapsed into a dependence on the single `` peak height '' parameter , @xmath168 .",

    "the dependence of halo concentration on mass becomes progressively weaker with increasing redshift , as found earlier by zhao et al ( 2003b ) . at @xmath137 , concentrations are almost independent of mass over the mass range accessible to our simulations .",
