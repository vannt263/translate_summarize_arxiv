    "microbial identification is the task of determining to which species a microorganism isolated from a clinical or industrial sample belongs .",
    "it plays a central role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and industrial quality control . in the clinical",
    "setting , identification is often the first step towards a finer characterization of the microorganism , aiming in general to establish its virulence and/or antibiotic resistance profiles , which is ultimately used by the clinician to prescribe a therapy .    since the proof of concept of bacterial identification with maldi - tof ms  @xcite , , this high - throughput technology has been improved up to a genuine paradigm breaking technology in microbiology , allowing to quickly , cheaply and efficiently characterize a microorganism  @xcite . starting from an isolated colony of the targeted microorganism , maldi - tof ms provides a snapshot of its proteomic content .",
    "such a proteomic fingerprint is highly species specific , and can be used to identify a microorganism by matching it with a reference database of annotated fingerprints  @xcite .    at the basis of maldi - tof ms identification system",
    "is therefore a software component in charge of finding the closest match between the fingerprint of the unknown microorganisms and the reference fingerprints of the database . from the data analysis perspective , this can be formalized as a multiclass classification task .",
    "this learning task presents several challenging issues .",
    "first , maldi - tof mass spectra are measured on several tens of thousands of mass to charge channels , and although they are generally pre - processed in order to extract their predominant peaks  @xcite , the resulting peak lists are still high - dimensional vectors . moreover ,",
    "current commercial systems like the biotyper ( bruker daltonics , germany ) , lt2 ( andromas , france ) , or vitek - ms ( biomrieux , france ) address several hundreds of species  @xcite , which constitutes a relatively massive multiclass problem . finally , the number of observations per class , that is , of representative strains per species , is often limited , which leads to strongly unbalanced datasets . on the other hand ,",
    "the classes of the problem correspond to microbial species which can be organized into well known hierarchical structures , generally defined in terms of evolutionary distances and/or phenotypic differences .",
    "such tree structures provide a rich source of information that could be added as prior knowledge within the training of automatic microbial identification systems .",
    "several `` structured '' machine learning methods were indeed recently proposed for taking into account the structure embedded in a hierarchy and using it as additional _ a priori _",
    "information  @xcite , and could potentially be used to train microbial identification systems .",
    "surprisingly , however , this possibility has not been investigated to our knowledge , and current systems implement `` flat '' multiclass classification algorithms that do not take into account the known tree structure .",
    "in this paper , we evaluate the relevance of structured machine - learning methods in the context of microbial identification from maldi - tof mass spectra . for that purpose",
    ", we use the micromass dataset  @xcite to benchmark several `` flat '' and `` structured '' machine learning techniques .",
    "the dataset considered in this benchmark is described in table  [ tab : micromass ] .",
    "it involves 20 gram positive and negative bacterial species covering nine genera .",
    "this dataset was extracted from the reference database embedded in the commercial vitek - ms system and made public through the uci machine learning repository .",
    "each species is represented by 11 to 60 mass spectra obtained from 7 to 20 bacterial strains , leading altogether to a dataset of 213 strains and 571 spectra .",
    "these spectra were obtained according to the standard workflow used in clinical routine in which the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate from 24 to 48 hours , before some colonies were picked , spotted on a maldi slide and a mass spectrum was acquired .    .",
    "* micromass dataset*. this table describes the micromass dataset content , in terms of used bacterial genera and species .",
    "it also provides information on the number of bacterial strains and mass - spectra for each species . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the benchmark experiment described in the previous sections are summarized in table [ tab:03 ] .",
    "considering the overall accuracy obtained by the various methods , we first note that svm classifiers , with an accuracy ranging from 86.6 to 89.4% , outperform random forests ( accuracy of 84% ) and similarity - based approaches ( accuracy of 76.8% and 78.8% for the nearest neighbour and nearest centroid approaches respectively ) . in both cases , these differences are significant ( @xmath0-value @xmath1 ) . among the different svm formulations , we see that the best structured svm ( ` structured ` ) , with an accuracy of 89.4% , outperforms the best `` flat '' svms ( ` svm - ova ` and ` multiclass ` ) , which reach an accuracy of 88.9% .",
    "this difference , however , is not significant ( @xmath0-value @xmath2 ) , suggesting that the more elaborate structured svms are not particularly useful for this application .",
    "this being said , a closer look at the nature of the misclassifications , given in table [ tab:03 ] , reveals some slight differences between the various svm strategies .",
    "we note indeed that while ` svm - ova ` , ` multiclass ` , ` treeloss ` and ` structured ` make fewer errors than ` svm - ovo ` and ` coc ` ( 54 to 57 _ versus _ 65 to 66 ) , some of these errors involve mistaking a species for a species of the other gram , which never occur with ` svm - ovo ` and ` coc ` .",
    "this however comes at the price of an increased proportion of errors involving mistaking a species for another one of the same gram but of another genus , and therefore suggests that a trade - off between the number and the severity of the classification errors can be achieved . in a similar spirit ,",
    "we observe some discrepancies between the results provided by the two cascade approaches ( ` coc ` and ` dsvm ` ) : while the two approaches lead to a similar number of classification errors , ` dsvm ` leads to a higher rate of uncorrect gram errors for a lower rate of distinct genus but same gram errors .",
    "these two methods only differ in the tree considered , which therefore suggests that its structure has indeed an important role in the learning process and that it could be optimized @xcite .",
    "finally , a striking observation that can be made from table [ tab:03 ] is that the great majority of errors involve predicting a species for a species of the same genus , for any considered method .",
    "while this makes sense from a biological point of view , this raises at least two hypotheses to explain why the structured methods considered in this benchmark , and in particular those derived from the structured svm formalism ( ` treeloss ` and ` structured ` ) , did not bring any improvement over their `` flat '' counterparts .",
    "first , we note that with a loss function @xmath3 defined as the length of the shortest path between species @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the tree , this type of error is the less penalized one .",
    "while this is indeed a natural and relevant definition , it can mainly be expected to limit the number of errors involving remote pairs of species , and hardly to improve over a `` flat '' strategy that does a limited number of errors of this kind , as this is the case for ` svm - ova ` for instance . on the other hand",
    ", it may also be the case that the tree considered in this study is not informative below the genus level .",
    "as mentioned previously , the dataset considered in this study involves several pairs or groups of species that are known to be hard to discriminate in general , and by maldi - tof ms in particular .",
    "figure [ fig : commonmistakes ] shows the counts of the most common types of misclassifications obtained across all the methods considered .",
    "it reveals that five pairs or groups of species proved to be particularly challenging : _ bacillus cereus _",
    "/ _ b. thuringiensis _ , _ streptococcus mitis _",
    "/ _ s. oralis _ , _ enterobacter asburiae _ / _",
    "e. cloacae _ , _",
    "citrobacter braakii _",
    "/ _ c. freundii _ , and the group defined by _",
    "e. coli _ and the three _ shigella _ species .",
    "it also shows that _ e. coli _ and _ enterobacter cloacae _",
    ", that do not belong to the same genus but both to the _ enterobacteriaceae _ family , are relatively often mistaken .",
    "the biological proximity within some of these pairs or groups of species may in fact be beyond what can be captured by the maldi - tof technology .",
    "the _ b. cereus _ and _ b. thuringiensis _",
    "species are for instance known to belong to the _ bacillus cereus _ group , which is sometimes considered to define a single species @xcite and other studies indeed suggest that they can not be discriminated by maldi - tof @xcite .",
    "_ streptococcus mitis _ and _ streptococcus oralis _ are also part of similar group comprising more than 99@xmath6 16s rrna similarity @xcite , and maldi - tof mass - spectrometry is known to be hardly able to distinguish them properly @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bacillus ] illustrates the fact that mass spectra obtained in this study from _ b. cereus _ and _ b. thuringiensis _",
    "are hardly distinguishable , at least when they have undergone the process of peak extraction , as opposed to the spectra obtained from _",
    "clostridium difficile _ and _ c. glycolicum _ , that are almost never mistaken one for the other .",
    "we evaluated several structured methods in the microbial identification context , using mass - spectrometry data .",
    "our results suggest that methods exploiting the underlying bacterial hierarchical structure perform as well as standard `` flat '' methods .",
    "we noted in particular that the majority of classification errors obtained by all the methods considered in this benchmark are within - genus misidentifications .",
    "we postulate that the structured methods considered in this benchmark are not tailored to improve flat methods for this type of errors .",
    "unfortunately , a larger panel of strains with a careful definition of the reference identification would be required to validate this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a structured regularization method specifically designed to cope with this issue , and it would therefore be interesting to evaluate its relevance in this context .",
