    "we use the symbol @xmath18 for the metric space of @xmath0-dimensional convex bodies under the ( multiplicative ) banach - mazur distance @xmath19 .",

    "the famous hadwiger covering conjecture @xcite  also called the levi - hadwiger conjecture or the gohberg - markus - hadwiger conjecture  states that any @xmath23 can be covered by @xmath24 of its smaller positive homothetic copies with @xmath24 homothets needed only if @xmath3 is an affine @xmath0-cube .",
    "this conjecture appears in several equivalent forms one of which we discuss here .",
    "boltyanski @xcite and hadwiger @xcite introduced two notions of illumination of a convex body , the former being ` _ _ illumination by directions _ _ ' while the latter being ` _ _ illumination by points _ _ ' .",
    "the two notions are actually equivalent @xcite and @xmath3 is said to be _ illuminated _ if all points on the boundary of @xmath3 are illuminated ( in either sense ) .",
    "the _ illumination number _ @xmath25 of @xmath3 is the smallest @xmath26 for which @xmath3 can be illuminated by @xmath26 points ( resp . , directions ) .",
    "furthermore , boltyanski @xcite showed that @xmath27 if and only if the smallest number of smaller positive homothets of @xmath3 that can cover @xmath3 is @xmath26 .",
    "thus the hadwiger covering conjecture can be reformulated as the boltyanski - hadwiger illumination conjecture , which states that for any @xmath0-dimensional convex body @xmath3 we have @xmath28 , and @xmath29 only if @xmath3 is an affine @xmath0-cube . despite the interest in these problems",
    "they have only been solved in general in two dimensions or for select few classes of convex bodies .",
    "we refer to @xcite for detailed surveys of these and other related problems of homothetic covering and illumination .",
    "this apparent difficulty has recently led to the introduction of quantitative versions of illumination and covering problems .",
    "for instance , it can be seen that in the definition of illumination number @xmath25 , the light sources can be taken arbitrarily far from @xmath3 .",
    "however , it seems natural to start with a relatively small number of light sources and quantify how far they need to be from @xmath3 in order to illuminate it .",
    "this is the idea behind the illumination parameter @xmath30 of an @xmath2-symmetric convex body @xmath3 defined by the first named author @xcite as follows .",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the norm of @xmath33 generated by the symmetric convex body @xmath3 . clearly , @xmath34 , for @xmath2-symmetric convex bodies .",
    "several authors have investigated the illumination parameter of @xmath2-symmetric convex bodies @xcite , determining exact values in several cases .    inspired by the above quantification ideas , swanepoel @xcite introduced the covering parameter of a @xmath0-dimensional convex body to quantify its covering properties .",
    "this is given by @xmath35    thus large homothets are penalized in the same way as far away light sources are penalized in the definition of illumination parameter .",
    "note here @xmath3 is not assumed to have any symmetry as the definition of covering parameter does not make use of the norm @xmath36 . in the same paper ,",
    "swanepoel obtained the following rogers - type upper bounds on @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 he further showed that if @xmath3 is @xmath2-symmetric , then @xmath40    despite the usefulness of the covering parameter , not much is known about it .",
    "for instance , we do not know whether @xmath41 is lower or upper semicontinuous on @xmath18 and the only known exact value is @xmath42 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to come up with a more refined quantification of covering in terms of the covering index with the hadwiger covering conjecture as the eventual goal .",
    "we show that the covering index possesses a number of useful properties such as upper bounding several quantities associated with the covering and illumination of convex bodies , lower semicontinuity , compatibility with direct vector sum and minkowski sum , a complete characterization of minimizers and the development of tools to compute its exact values for several convex bodies .",
    "furthermore , the covering index gives rise to a number of open problems about the homothetic covering behavior of convex bodies in general , and @xmath0-dimensional balls and ball - polyhedra in particular . in section [ variations ] , we discuss a variant of the covering index that is perhaps more natural , but possesses weaker properties .",
    "finally , in section [ improved ] , we obtain upper bounds on the covering and weak covering indices .",
    "before formally defining the covering index , we describe two other related ideas that , in addition to the covering parameter , influence our definition of the covering index .    given a positive integer @xmath43 ,",
    "lassak @xcite introduced the _ @xmath43-covering number _ of a convex body @xmath3 as the minimal positive homothety ratio needed to cover @xmath3 by @xmath43 homothets .",
    "that is , @xmath44 lassak showed that the @xmath43-covering number is well - defined and studied the special case @xmath45 for planar convex bodies .",
    "zong @xcite studied @xmath46 as a functional and proved it to be uniformly continuous for all @xmath43 and @xmath0 .",
    "he did not use the term @xmath43-covering number for @xmath47 and simply referred to it as the smallest positive homothety ratio .",
    "obviously , any @xmath23 can be covered by @xmath24 smaller positive homothets if and only if @xmath48 . zong used these ideas to propose a possible computer - based approach to attack the hadwiger covering conjecture @xcite .    given convex bodies @xmath49 , the _ covering number of @xmath3 by @xmath50 _ is denoted by @xmath51 and is defined as the minimum number of translates of @xmath50 needed to cover @xmath3 . among covering problems , the problem of covering the @xmath0-dimensional ball by smaller positive homothets has generated a lot of interest .",
    "one question that has been asked repeatedly is : what is the value of @xmath52 @xcite ?",
    "in particular , the case @xmath53 has attracted special attention .",
    "verger - gaugry @xcite showed that @xmath54    we can now present the formal definition of covering index .    [ coin - def ] let @xmath3 be a @xmath0-dimensional convex body .",
    "we define the _ covering index _ of @xmath3 as @xmath55    intuitively , @xmath56 measures how @xmath3 can be covered by a relatively small number of positive homothets all corresponding to the same relatively small homothety ratio .",
    "we note that @xmath56 is an affine invariant quantity assigned to @xmath3 , i.e. , if @xmath57 is an invertible linear map then @xmath58 .",
    "we have the following relationship .",

    "the reader may be a bit surprised to see the restriction @xmath65 .",
    "one immediate consequence of this restriction is that for any @xmath66 , @xmath67 that is , @xmath68 .",

    "@xmath56 ) can be used to estimate @xmath70 ( resp .",

    "the proofs of relations ( [ half ] ) and ( [ dim ] ) make extensive use of homothety ratios to be less than or equal to half .",
    "this shows that the ` half constraint ' in the definition of covering index results in a quantity with potentially nicer properties .",

    "second , remark [ balls ] provides another example of a situation when inequality ( [ two ] ) is strict , as @xmath426 .",

    "we conclude by listing some of the known values ( or estimates ) of the covering index . we remark that table 1 can be continued indefinitely by using the operations of direct vector addition and the minkowski addition , resulting in infinitely many convex bodies for which we know exact values of @xmath62 , and infinitely many convex bodies for which we can estimate @xmath62 .",

    "<S> we show that the covering index is a lower semicontinuous functional on the banach - mazur space of convex bodies . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the affine @xmath0-cubes minimize covering index in any dimension @xmath0 , while circular disks maximize it in the plane . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the covering index satisfies a nice compatibility with the operations of direct vector sum and vector sum . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we obtain an exact formula for the covering index of a direct vector sum of convex bodies that works in infinitely many instances . </S>",
    "<S> this together with a minimization property can be used to determine the covering index of infinitely many convex bodies . </S>",
    "<S> as the name suggests , the weak covering index loses some of the important properties of the covering index . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtain upper bounds on the covering and weak covering index .    </S>",
