    "@xmath0 equation:@xmath16 for `` hamilton s characteristic function '' @xmath17 , with the energy entering as one of the additional parameters on which the principal function has to depend .",
    "however , even in this case , the most general solution of eq.([hj1 ] ) need not be linear in @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath0 equations come from the search for a canonical transformation on the extended phase space @xmath19 such that:@xmath20 with the additional requirement that @xmath21 , i.e. that , in the sought - for new coordinates:@xmath22 or , more generally:@xmath23 be the `` model dynamics '' we would like to relate with our starting one , i.e.:@xmath24    of course , we might consider other `` model dynamics '' .",
    "for example , we might require that : @xmath25 , in such a way that the `` model dynamics '' would be:@xmath26    clearly , other models could be implemented .",
    "for instance , we might require:@xmath27 and hence : @xmath28 .",
    "the associated partial differential equations would be : @xmath29 or:@xmath30\\ ] ]    while the first two cases are strictly local , the third one is `` less local '' , it identifies some equilibrium points , say @xmath31 , which are also stable ones .    the conditions for solvability of these @xmath32 s are quite strong .",
    "for instance , the first one requires : @xmath33 , i.e. that the system be maximally integrable .",
    "the second one requires the system to be completely integrable , while the third one requires not only complete integrability , but also that there be stable equilibrium points .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 problem in this generalized form would solve not only a conjugacy problem , i.e. how to transform a given dynamical system into another one with a preassigned form , but one would find also the required transformation to be generated by a function @xmath6 .",
    "> from a geometrical point of view , the first case requires the original dynamics to define a fundamental vector field of the natural foliation of the contact manifold after we have removed possible equilibrium points . in  the second case the phase space is foliated by invariant cylinders , while in the third case the dynamics will preserve a foliation by tori .",
    "as already noticed , the conditions for the solution of the various problems are quite stringent , and one should expect that global solutions can be found only very rarely .",
    "nevertheless , this more general perspective may be interesting because it could provide the hamilton - jacobi theory with a wider range of applications .",
    "for instance , it might be applied to the study of scattering problems , where now @xmath34 would be the `` comparison hamiltonian '' and @xmath35 that of the system one is analyzing .",
    "it might be also applicable in field theory and general relativity .",
    "in particular , one might consider applying it to quantum mechanics going beyond the usual @xmath36 approximation .",
    "_ let us observe that if we define , keeping the additional parameters fixed:__@xmath37 _ _ and we form @xcite the vector field:__@xmath38 _ it is immediate to show , using eq.([hj2 ] ) , that if : _ @xmath39 _ is an integral curve for the vector field _ @xmath40 _ _ , then : _",
    "_ @xmath41 _ is in turn an integral curve for hamilton s canonical equations .",
    "thus , eq.([hj2 ] ) describes in a unified manner one particular family of the phase - space equations of motion . _",
    "it is worth stressing that , already at this rather well - known level , the hamilton - jacobi theory establishes a deep connection between first - order partial differential equations @xmath42 and systems of first - order ordinary differential equations @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "quite similar connections appear when one investigates the short - wavelength limit of `` wave - like '' equations ( including also the schrdinger equation ) such as hamiltonian optics as the short - wavelength rgime of wave optics ( the eikonal approximation @xcite , but see also ref.@xcite for applications in field theory ) and classical mechanics as the short - wavelength rgime of wave mechanics @xcite .    in taking this limit ,",
    "one starts with some differential operator of hyperbolic type on some manifold @xmath2 , passes through a hamilton - jacobi - type equation ( the characteristics equation @xcite ) for a function @xmath6 and , by substituting covectors ( the @xmath45 s ) for the first - order derivatives , arrives at a some hamiltonian function on the cotangent bundle @xmath1  which yields also the dispersion relation of the wave motion .",
    "the associated hamilton equations give rise , by projection on @xmath2 of the solutions , to the bi - characteristics @xcite of the original differential system .",
    "rephrased in an `` optical '' language , the characteristics describe the propagation of wave fronts , while the bi - characteristics describe that of rays .",
    "note that `` substituting covectors for first - order derivatives '' , in the case in which the differential operator is homogeneous , is just a down - to - the -earth way of saying that we deal with what is known as the symbol @xcite of the operator .",

    "@xcite is widely used both in wave optics and wave mechanics to investigate several physical problems in the short - wavelength rgime which , in wave mechanics , amounts to a leading - term expansion in powers of the planck constant @xmath48 .",
    "it is also closely related to the saddle - point approximation ( plus one - loop corrections ) in the path - integral approach to problems in field theory @xcite , quantum @xcite and statistical mechanics @xcite . in this context , and concentrating for the sake of definiteness on the motion of a particle of mass @xmath49 in a potential @xmath50 , one represents the wave function ( in gaussian form ) as into the definition of @xmath6 , writing then : @xmath51 , where the @xmath6 of eq.([wkb ] ) is replaced by @xmath52 and is no more real.[foot ] ] : @xmath53 ( with both @xmath54 and @xmath6 real ) . substituting into the schrdinger equation ,",
    "one ends up with the ( exact ) coupled equations @xcite:@xmath55 and:@xmath56 where : @xmath57 and : @xmath58 .",
    "neglecting `` quantum correction '' proportional to @xmath59 on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([hj3 ] ) yields the @xmath0 equation ( [ hj1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath6 solves the time - dependent @xmath0 equation , it is possible to show ( see , e.g . ,",
    "app.@xmath60 of ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite ) that eq.([continuity ] ) is solved by ) is the well - known @xcite _ pauli - morette - van vleck determinant._]:@xmath61 where the @xmath62 s are the initial coordinates , and hence the @xmath44 solution is : @xmath63    as discussed in ref.@xcite , eq.([propag ] ) yields the @xmath44 approximation to the _ propagator _ ( or green function ) for the schrdinger operator , and the result becomes exact  for _ quadratic _ hamiltonians .",
    "similar conclusions hold @xcite in the path - integral formalism , where the saddle - point approximation also becomes exact for quadratic hamiltonians ( or lagrangians ) .",
    "a useful geometrical formulation of the @xmath0 theory can be given as follows .",
    "consider a symplectic manifold : @xmath64 with symplectic structure @xmath65 . with any symplectomorphism:@xmath66 @xmath67",
    "we may associate a `` graph '' @xmath68 , i.e. a submanifold in the symplectic manifold @xmath69 , the second factor being equipped with the symplectic structure @xmath70:@xmath71 by requiring it to be lagrangian w.r.t .",
    "the symplectic structure on @xmath69 provided by : @xmath72    by using the fact that : @xmath73 , we can consider those lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath74 that can be written as graphs:@xmath75 when @xmath68 projects onto @xmath76 we may consider it as the graph of a generating function @xmath6 .    in many cases @xmath77 may admit of many alternative cotangent bundle structures , i.e. we may identify `` alternative '' submanifolds @xmath78 such that : @xmath79 , with @xmath2 and @xmath78 possible alternative `` placements '' of some external configuration space @xmath80 .",
    "a typical example is provided by : @xmath81 , where any identification of  an affine subspace @xmath82 is  a possible placement of an `` abstract '' @xmath82 .",
    "> from this point of view , if we start with @xmath83 and @xmath68 we may look for a particular placement of @xmath2 in @xmath77 that makes @xmath68 projectable ( a submersion onto ) @xmath76 .",
    "the usual `` colloquial '' classification into `` four possible sets of independent canonical variables '' usually encountered in textbooks on classical mechanics , say @xmath84 and @xmath85 are exactly different identifications of the `` configuration space '' over which one constructs the cotangent bundle structure",
    ". therefore we would have the corresponding symplectic structures : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 and : @xmath89 respectively .",
    "when the graph @xmath90 is viewed as a map : @xmath91 , i.e. the second factor @xmath2 is considered as a family of `` parameters '' , we may obtain a regular foliation of @xmath1 .",
    "then we may say that @xmath6 is a `` complete solution '' of some associated @xmath0 equation , and in this case the hamiltonian flow associated with the hamiltonian @xmath34 would preserve the foliation induced by @xmath6 on @xmath1 . on the open dense submanifolds",
    "on which : @xmath92 provides a diffeomorphism we would have equivalence between the cauchy problem in terms of initial data @xmath93 and the boundary value problem in terms of @xmath94 .",
    "we notice that in this case:@xmath95 is a symplectic structure ( cfr .",
    "eq.([essential ] ) ) on @xmath76 , and hence it would allow for a hamiltonian formulation on the space of `` boundary data '' rather than of the `` initial conditions '' .",
    "the inverse image of the one - parameter group of evolution on @xmath1 would provide the `` propagator '' on the configuration space .    by using the geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics a similar picture",
    "can be considered also for quantum mechanics in the schrdinger picture .",
    "let us restrict for convenience to a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath96 . again",
    "a transformation:@xmath97 will be associated with a graph:@xmath98    if we consider on @xmath99 the pseudo - hermitian form:@xmath100 and noticing that , on @xmath101 , @xmath102 , we find that  @xmath101 will be isotropic w.r.t .",
    "the pseudo - hermitian form ( [ pseudoherm ] ) iff @xmath103 is a unitary transformation .    by considering the realification of @xmath96 ,",
    "the hermitian product decomposes into a real and an imaginary part , the former providing an euclidean product and the latter a symplectic product .    as for the symplectic part ,",
    "we have  a situation similar to the one we considered previously , i.e. we may consider a generating function of the canonical transformation and require afterwards that this transformation should preserve also the euclidean product . in a somewhat simplified notation",
    "we may write then:@xmath104 and then we require , in addition:@xmath105    the resulting transformation would be a khlerian transformation derived from the generating function @xmath106 .",
    "for : @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109:@xmath110 for example , a hadamard gate:@xmath111{cc}1 & 1\\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{array } \\right\\vert\\ ] ] has the generating function:@xmath112      in the heisenberg picture , one may devise a direct approach to the @xmath0 problem by replacing classical variables with hermitian operators .",
    "indeed , shortly after the advent of quantum mechanics , various efforts were made @xcite to formulate both the theory of canonical transformations and hence also the action principle @xcite and the hamilton - jacobi equation in operator terms from the very beginning .",
    "following , e.g. , the scheme of eqs.([hj1 ] ) to ( [ ct1 ] ) , one might be tempted to `` promote '' these equations to operator equations defining a ( quantum ) canonical transformation as:@xmath113 and a ( quantum ) @xmath0 equation as:@xmath114    due to operator - ordering problems , these equations are obviously ambiguous . according to jordan @xcite and dirac @xcite the ambiguity should be resolved by requiring @xmath6 and the operators in eqs.([qct ] ) and ( [ qhj ] ) to be `` _ _ well ordered _ _ '' , i.e. by requiring all the `` uppercase '' operators ( the @xmath115 s ) to stay to the right of the `` lowercase '' ones ( the @xmath116 s ) .",
    "this implies that the `` generating operator '' @xmath6 should be of the general form @xcite:@xmath117 for suitable functions @xmath118 and @xmath119 . the `` well - ordering '' procedure must be applied also , using when necessary the commutation relations , to the hamiltonian operator @xmath35 in eq.([qhj ] ) .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite have devised a procedure for converting the operator equation ( [ qhj ] ) into a @xmath120-number equation that we will illustrate here on a simple example , namely that of a ( non - relativistic ) @xmath121 particle of mass @xmath49 subject to a scalar potential @xmath122 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then:@xmath123 and the ( operator ) @xmath0 equation becomes ( @xmath124):@xmath125    sandwiching between eigenstates , @xmath126 , and similarly for @xmath115 . ]",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath128 of @xmath116 and @xmath115 respectively , the `` well ordering '' prescription leads to:@xmath129 i.e. to a ( uniquely defined and not necessarily real ) @xmath120-number function @xmath130 .",
    "sandwiching between the same eigenstates the quadratic term on the l.h.s . of eq.([qhj2 ] ) is a bit more complicated .",
    "explicitly:@xmath131 now , the standard canonical commutation relations imply , for any function @xmath132@xmath133   = i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\widehat{q}}\\ ] ] using then the first of eqs.([qct ] ) ( i.e. : @xmath134 ) one finds @xcite:@xmath135 which is again a `` well ordered '' expression , and hence:@xmath136   \\langle q|q\\rangle\\ ] ]    dropping then the common factor @xmath137 one obtains the @xmath120-number equation ) ( as well as the classical equation ( [ hj1 ] ) ) contains only derivatives of @xmath6 , any solution will be ambiguous by the addition of a constant term .",
    "this ambiguity , which is totally irrelevant at the classical level , will turn out instead to be useful in what follows .",
    "[ foot2]]:@xmath138   + v\\left (   q\\right )   + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}s\\left ( q , q , t\\right )   = 0\\label{qhj3}\\ ] ] which is completely equivalent to the operator equation ( [ qhj2 ] ) .",
    "eq.([qhj3 ] ) is precisely the equation that results @xcite from the schrdinger equation ( in the variables @xmath139 ) by expressing the wave function @xmath140 as ( see footnote @xmath141):@xmath142 it provides then a solution of the schrdinger equation depending ( in an essential way ) from the additional parameter @xmath2 , just as the propagator @xmath143 @xcite , which obeys the same equation , does .",
    "the propagator is known @xcite to obey the boundary condition : @xmath144 as @xmath145 and , in order to complete the identification , one has to check ( the equation being first - order in time ) that there is a solution of the form ( [ qhj4 ] ) which does the same .",
    "for example , from the well - known result @xcite for the propagator of the @xmath121 harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath49 , proper frequency @xmath146 and hamiltonian:@xmath147 one can check directly that : @xmath148 + \\frac{i\\hbar } { 2}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{2\\pi i\\hbar \\sin \\left ( \\omega t\\right ) } { m\\omega } \\right ) \\label{prop1}\\]]does indeed solve eq.([qhj3 ] ) with the appropriate boundary condition , insertion of eq.([prop1 ] ) into eq.([qhj4 ] ) reproduces of course the kernel for the @xmath121 free particle . ] .",
    "it is then immediate to see that the `` well - ordered '' solution of the operator equation ( [ qct2 ] ) will be:@xmath149 + \\frac{i\\hbar } { 2}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{2\\pi i\\hbar \\sin \\left ( \\omega t\\right ) } { m\\omega } \\right )    \\label{prop2}\\ ] ]    when substituting from eq.([prop2 ] ) into eq.([qct2 ] ) we need to square the derivative : @xmath150 .",
    "this brings about terms that are not `` well - ordered '' .",
    "bringing them in the correct order @xcite requires using the ( exact ) commutation relation : @xmath151 = -i\\hbar\\sin\\left (   \\omega t\\right )   /m\\omega$ ] .",
    "the time derivative of the last term in eq.([prop2 ] ) ( see also footnote [ foot2 ] ) does then the job of compensating for this operation .    the short - time limit of eq.([prop2 ] )",
    "is:@xmath152which is the same as for the free particle .",
    "the harmonic potential does not contribute to this short - time limit .",
    "as remarked in ref.@xcite , the same will happen more generally for any nonsingular potential @xmath153 .",
    "so , the result ( prop3 ) will have a more general significance , going slightly beyond the case of quadratic potentials .",
    "going back now to our general discussion , the attempt to recover the original @xmath32 from the equations of motion of the `` rays '' , i.e. hamilton s equations , is what is usually called the `` quantization problem '' .",
    "this interplay between @xmath32 s , associated first - order @xmath32 s ( @xmath0-type equations ) describing the propagation of `` wave - fronts '' and the corresponding , `` ray '' @xmath154 s ( hamilton s equations ) has been widely investigated in various branches of theoretical physics . moreover , because of the hamiltonian - lagrangian correspondence , also the calculus of variations appears in this interplay .",
    "> from all these remarks it should be clear that the @xmath0 theory is very rich in analytic and geometric ideas , and that it unifies apparently diverse topics like higher - order @xmath32 s , first - order @xmath32 s , @xmath154 s and the calculus of variations .    in this paper we will try and use some of our experience with quantum mechanics to formulate and give a geometric  presentation of many problems which , born in a quantum setting , are of more general validity in the framework of the hamilton - jacobi theory .",
    "besides many original papers on this vast subject , we shall rely on some work by a.vinogradov @xcite , some more recent work by grabowski and poncin @xcite , a previous paper of ours @xcite and recent paper on the hamilton - jacobi theory in a lagrangian setting @xcite . we shall discuss the following topics :    -reviewing briefly how the @xmath0 problem can be formulated in geometric terms on the cotangent bundle @xmath1 of a smooth manifold @xmath2 , we shall discuss how the same problem can be formulated on the tangent bundle @xmath155 , hence in a lagrangian setting .",
    "-how one can pose a generalized @xmath0 problem for differential operators of any order , giving another coordinate - free characterization of the @xmath0 equation .",
    "-we shall try and discuss to which extent , instead of differential operators acting on functions , one can consider differential operators acting on sections of vector bundles , thereby obtaining `` wave - like '' equations that are not scalar , like the pauli and the dirac equations .    -just as in quantum mechanics one poses a joint eigenvalue problem for two ( or more ) observables , we shall discuss how one can pose a `` joint @xmath0 problem '' for more than two functions on the cotangent bundle , and , finally ,    -after `` revisiting '' briefly the geometrical formulation of the time - dependent hamilton - jacobi theory , whose proper setting @xcite is on the cotangent bundle @xmath156 , we shall discuss how one can obtain generalizations thereof when the action of the abelian group @xmath157 is replaced with that of a general lie group @xmath158 ( a `` @xmath0 problem on a lie group '' , then ) .",
    "let us begin by recalling  @xcite some preliminary notions .",
    "the cotangent bundle @xmath1 carries with it the canonical ( exact ) symplectic structure:@xmath159 where , in local coordinates : @xmath160 , and hence : @xmath161 .",

    "it is clear from eq.([map1 ] ) that:@xmath168 where : @xmath169 is the canonical projection .",
    "this shows that  @xmath170 gives a global section of @xmath1 . @xmath166",

    "being closed , @xmath164 will be locally exact , i.e. : @xmath178 for some function @xmath179 , at least locally . whether or not such a function exists globally will depend on whether or not @xmath180 , the first de rham cohomology group of @xmath2 , is trivial .",

    "for example , as mentioned already in sect.[tihj2 ] , posing a `` hamilton - jacobi problem '' as the search of foliations of the energy surfaces by lagrangian but not necessarily transversal submanifolds opens the possibility of implementing the full set of canonical symmetries as symmetries of the hamilton - jacobi problem as well .",
    "we have also shown elsewhere @xcite how to deal , in the same fully geometric spirit , with transformations and symmetries for partial differential equations of the monge - ampre type . using the present generalization to differential operators acting on sections of vector bundles it should be possible to incorporate into the formalism more general @xmath32 s than those of the above `` monge - ampre '' type .",
