    "the light elements beryllium and boron ( beb ) provide unique insight into the nature of non - thermal nucleosynthesis in our galaxy . due to their low binding energy ,",
    "these nuclei are not produced significantly in the big bang ( thomas , schramm , olive , & fields @xcite , delbourgo - salvador & vangioni - flam @xcite ) or in stellar nuclear burning .",
    "instead , beb are made by spallation processes due to energetic nuclei and neutrinos .",
    "the nucleosynthesis origin of beb is in principle encoded in their abundances in the most primitive , metal poor ( population ii ) stars .",
    "indeed , the mere presence of be in halo stars is perhaps the strongest evidence that accelerated particles were present in the early galaxy .",
    "thus , in this paper we will focus on pop ii beb trends , via a detailed analysis of the data and a comparison with recent models .",
    "the production of beb by galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) spallation of interstellar cno nuclei was the standard model for beb nucleosynthesis for almost two decades after first being proposed ( reeves , fowler , & hoyle @xcite ; meneguzzi , audouze , & reeves @xcite ) .",
    "however , this simple model was challenged by the observations of beb abundances in pop ii stars , and particularly the beb trends versus metallicity .",
    "measurements showed that both be and b vary roughly _ linearly _ with fe , a so - called `` primary '' scaling .",
    "in contrast , standard gcr nucleosynthesis predicts that beb should be `` secondary '' versus spallation targets cno , giving @xmath5 ( vangioni - flam , cass , audouze , & oberto @xcite ) . if o and fe are co - produced ( i.e.",
    ", if o / fe is constant ) then the data clearly contradicts the canonical theory , i.e. beb production via standard gcr s .",
    "beb abundances in pop ii stars have thus provided the motivation for primary beb nucleosynthesis , in which the production rate is independent of metallicity .",
    "these primary models invoke the extraction and acceleration of fresh products of nucleosynthesis ( @xmath6 s , co ) originating from type ii supernovae and wolf - rayet stars and fragmenting on interstellar h and he .",
    "they should be considered in addition to the standard gcr ( secondary ) process ; any primary process would be expected to play a major role in the early galaxy ( halo phase ) , whereas the secondary one takes over in the galactic disk ( cass 1995 , vangioni - flam 1996 ) or earlier as we shall see .",
    "the transition between the two modes may vary depending on the adopted beb data , as well as the [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] correlation .",
    "one such primary model has focused on superbubbles  regions of hot , rarefied , metal - rich gas swept out by the collective effects of massive star winds and supernova explosions .",
    "these regions have been proposed ( vangioni - flam et al .",
    "@xcite ; higdon @xcite ; ramaty & lingenfelter @xcite ; parizot @xcite ; vangioni - flam , cass & audouze 1999 ) to accelerate freshly synthesized , metal - rich particles .",
    "the energy spectrum of these nuclei has been extensively studied by bykov ( 1999,@xcite ) and it is remarkably similar to the gcr injection spectrum . finally , core collapse supernovae themselves have been proposed as a site of 11 production ( and some 7 ) via spallation reactions between supernova neutrinos passing through the layer , the `` @xmath7-process '' ( woosley @xcite ) .",
    "recently , another solution has been proposed to resolve discrepancy between the observed beb abundances as a function of metallicity and the predicted secondary trend of gcr spallation . as noted above",
    ", standard gcr nucleosynthesis predicts @xmath8 , while observations show @xmath9 , roughly ; these two trends are inconsistent if o / fe is constant in pop ii .",
    "however , recent observations find o / fe increasing at low metallicities ( israelian , garca - lpez , & rebolo @xcite ; boesgaard @xcite ) .",
    "in fact boesgaard argue for a single slope of @xmath10 for o / fe vs. fe _ at all _ metallicities .",
    "as shown by fields & olive , a combination of standard gcr nucleosynthesis , and @xmath7-process production of 11 is consistent with current data .",
    "one should note that while the trend in o / fe is seen in the oh data and agrees with the o i triplet ( boesgaard @xcite ) , they continue to disagree with the observations of o / h using the forbidden [ o i ] line ( fulbright & kraft 1999 ) .",
    "it is clear that spallation processes , beb abundances , and o - fe evolution are closely linked . in this paper",
    ", we explore these connections via careful analysis of both data and theory .",
    "we use the most current beb data , with abundances derived from consistent stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we consider stellar parameters based the balmer - line data of axer , fuhrmann , & gehren and the irfm ( alonso @xcite ) .",
    "we first fit the data to both iron and oxygen to determine the overall primary vs. secondary nature of the beb abundances .",
    "these data are fit to a two - component , primary plus secondary , metallicity dependence .",
    "this fit quantifies both the strength of each component as well as the metallicity and hence epoch as which the secondary component becomes dominant .",
    "we compare these phenomenological results to the predictions of current models for beb nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution .",
    "we find that for the balmer line data , any primary component could only have been dominant at oxygen abundances [ o / h ] @xmath11 , which is at metallicities below the existing data .",
    "that is , for this data set , we find no evidence for primary beb production .",
    "in contrast , for the irfm data , we find that primary production dominates for [ o / h ] @xmath12 to @xmath4 ( depending on the exact data - see below ) .",
    "the higher value indicates indicating the need for a primary mechanism at low metallicities .",
    "if o / fe is constant then the transition between primary and secondary production processes would occur at [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",
    "as such , our quantitative conclusions can not be definitive .",
    "the derivation of the oxygen abundance from the observed spectra is delicate , specifically at low metallicity .",
    "moreover , non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects on fe could affect substantially the beb - fe relationship .",
    "we also point out that since magnesium is not plagued by the same difficulties regarding the stellar yields of fe , it would be worthwhile to examine the relationship of the beb elements with mg .",
    "new observations are eagerly awaited .",
    "the beb - ofe abundance trends encode the history of spallation in the galaxy .",
    "our ability to infer this history is completely determined by the accuracy of the abundance data studied .",
    "it is thus necessary to obtain high quality data .",
    "just as importantly , the abundances must be combined in a systematic and consistent way .    the determination of abundances from raw stellar spectra requires stellar atmosphere models .",
    "the atmospheric models require key input parameters , notably the effective temperature @xmath14 and surface gravity @xmath15 , and assumptions regarding , e.g. , the applicability of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no standard set of stellar parameters for the halo stars of interest . in practice ,",
    "different groups derive abundances via different procedures , which give similar results but retain systematic differences .",
    "the systematic differences in the data can in fact obscure the beb - ofe trends one seeks .",
    "thus , to derive meaningful beb fits , one must systematically and consistently present abundances derived under the same assumptions and parameters for stellar atmospheres .",
    "below , we will present results based for the available bebofe data based on two methods of analysis",
    ". we will refer to these as the balmer line data and the irfm data .",
    "the balmer line data is taken from the work of axer , fuhrmann , & gehren and fuhrmann , axer , & gehren .",
    "these authors have studied over 100 dwarf and subgiant stars to determine a consistent set of stellar parameters which includes the effective temperature , surface gravity and iron abundance .",
    "the effective temperatures are determined from the synthesis of the first four balmer lines",
    ". this amounts to a spectroscopic rather than a photometric determination of the effective temperature .",
    "the remaining parameters were determined simultaneously from the analysis of a number of iron lines .",
    "the temperatures determined this way are typically 100200 k higher than many of the photometric determinations in the literature . the [ fe / h ] abundance determined by axer , fuhrmann , & gehren are also typically higher than others sometimes by as much as 0.5 dex .",
    "it goes without saying that such differences can have an enormous effect in trying to establish a trend for beb vs. fe .",
    "an alternative method to obtain effective temperatures is achieved by comparing the bolometric flux and the ir flux at a fixed wavelength .",
    "this method , knows as the irfm , requires only the theoretical prediction of the continuum ir flux .",
    "there is a slight dependence on the assumed surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "a large compilation of nearly 500 stars for which the irfm was used to determine temperatures was presented in alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger .",
    "bonifacio and molaro used these temperatures to accurately determine li abundances in 41 plateau stars as a follow - up of their previous work using balmer line temperatures ( molaro , primas , & bonifacio @xcite ) .",
    "for li similar results were found for the plateau abundance in each of the two methods . in alonso ,",
    "arribas , & martinez - roger , calibrated expressions for the effective temperatures were derived based on the earlier tabulation .",
    "unfortunately , these calibrations do not always lead to the same temperatures found in the tabulations and differences by as much as 200 k occur .",
    "we will present results based on both ( 1 ) the irfm temperatures in the compilation alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger , and ( 2 ) based on the calibration .",
    "we can not overly stress the importance of reliable stellar data .",
    "the balmer - line data appear to be self - consistent , and are probably the most reliable .",
    "however , because we will present results based on the irfm temperature scales , we would like to point out that there are significant differences in the data . to illustrate the point we take for example the case of the star bd @xmath16 740 . from axer , we find this star to have ( @xmath17 , [ fe / h ] ) = ( 6264 , 3.72 , -2.36 ) .",
    "the beryllium and oxygen abundances for this star was reported by boesgaard and . when adjusted for these stellar parameters ,",
    "we find [ be / h ] = -13.36 , and [ o / h ] = -1.74 .",
    "in contrast , the stellar parameters from alonso are ( 6110,3.73,-2.01 ) with corresponding be and o abundances of -13.44 and -2.05 .",
    "garcia - lopez use a calibrated irfm based on alonso and take ( 6295,4.00 , -3.00 ) . for these choices ,",
    "we have [ be / h ] = -13.24 and [ o / h ] = -1.90 .",
    "notice the extremely large range in assumed metallicities and the difference in the two so - called irfm temperatures . while this may not be a typical example of the difference in stellar parameters , it is differences such as this ( and this star is not unique ) that accounts for the difference in our results and the implications we must draw from them .",
    "we also note that in addition to the large systematic differences in the fe abundances ( an order of magnitude in the above example ) , it has recently been argued that nlte effects for fe , particularly in low metallicity stars are non - negligible ( thvenin & idiart @xcite ) . at the low end of the metallicity range considered here ,",
    "they argue for a @xmath18 0.3 dex upward correction in [ fe / h ] .",
    "we have not included this correction in the data discussed below .    in the next section",
    "we will fit the beb - ofe abundances over pop ii metallicities .",
    "the fits span a metallicity range @xmath19 , and @xmath20 depending on the particular choice of stellar parameters .",
    "the upper bounds roughly mark the disk - halo transition , and the low metallicity bounds are just set by the availability of beb data .",
    "as we indicated , we will consider three sets of stellar parameters to be used in the beb vs ofe analysis .",
    "the three are : stellar parameters based on the balmer line data of axer  to be denoted as balmer ; the irfm , with data from alonso  denoted as irfm1 ; the irfm with stellar parameters as determined from the calibrations in alonso as reported by garcia - lopez and israelian  denoted as irfm2 .",
    "note that at low metallicities this calibration is based on an analytic formula which is divergent .",
    "thus , the points at low metallicity could be questionable .",
    "be abundances used in the present work are from rebolo , ryan , gilmore , rebolo , boesgaard & king , primas , hobbs & thorburn , molaro , boesgaard .",
    "for each star , and for each choice of balmer , irfm1,2 , we first adjust the be abundance to a common set of stellar parameters . then when multiple observations for a given star are available these abundances are weight averaged .",
    "lte is commonly used , since non - lte ( nlte ) corrections for be are not expected to be significant . in total",
    ", we have data on be for 37 stars .",
    "not all of the stellar parameters have been determined in a uniform way for the entire set of 37 stars . in the case of the balmer set",
    ", we have parameters from axer for 22 stars .",
    "this set can be enlarged somewhat using the data of boesgaard who have presented results based on two scales , the king scale which they claim is similar to balmer and carney which they claim is similar to irfm .",
    "thus for balmer + king we have data for 30 stars . in the case of irfm1",
    ", we also have data on 22 stars .",
    "irfm 1 + carney contains 25 stars .",
    "finally for irfm2 , there are only 18 stars , but irfm2 + carney gets us up to 24 stars .",
    "b abundances are taken from duncan and garcia - lopez and primas ( 1999 ) .",
    "nlte corrections for b are significant ( kiselman @xcite , kiselman & carlsson @xcite ) , and are not uniform over metallicity , giving larger enhancements at the lower metallicities .",
    "thus , nlte correction have the systematic effect of flattening the b - ofe trends .",
    "we apply the same procedure as described above for the boron data .",
    "there are a total of 15 low metallicity stars with boron measured , of which we have balmer data for 11 ( and balmer + king on 13 ) .",
    "9 stars are known for irfm1 ( and 10 for irfm1 + carney ) , and 11 for irfm2 .",
    ".slopes for o / fe versus fe . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : prod_ratios ]      as emphasized by ramaty , a study of the energy budget associated with beb production models can give additional insight .",
    "there are several ways to proceed , but the key point is to link the energy in accelerated particles required to make the beb with the available energy budget in the form of supernovae .",
    "the power of the analysis is in judging whether the energy requirement changes with metallicity ( and thus epoch ) ; in particular , it is important to see whether there is too large an energy requirement in population ii .",
    "we find that there is not an energetics problem in the models we consider .",
    "one way to see this is as follows . given a model , we wish to compute the accelerated particle energy input per supernova : [ eq : e_cr ] = where @xmath21 is the total energy going into particle acceleration throughout the galaxy per second , and @xmath22 is the supernova rate .",
    "the direct approach is simply to note that in both the gcr and primary components , supernovae are the power source of energetic particles : @xmath23 .",
    "since the power input is proportional to the supernova rate , their ratio @xmath24 is constant , independent of metallicity",
    ". the models always require the same accelerated particle energy per supernova .",
    "note that this approach simply examines the internal consistency of the model .",
    "we have not used the properties of the be data .",
    "we can use the data , however , and get the same conclusion .",
    "one can derive the @xmath24 scaling _ observationally _ by relating the be - o and be - fe data to the energy budget .",
    "this comes about by using the definition of @xmath24 above ( eq .  [ eq : e_cr ] ) and a `` chain rule '' expansion : [ eq : eobs ] ( ) _ obs = ( ) _ model ( ) _ obs ( ) _ model for the metal tracers @xmath25 .",
    "as we have indicated , the first and last terms must be taken from the model ( note that in pop ii , @xmath26 in the ramaty @xcite notation ) .",
    "the middle term can be related to the data , since @xmath27 as long as be can be expressed as a power law in @xmath28 .",
    "all theory terms ( both denominators and numerators ) are individually calculable , so we can now rearrange terms : @xmath29 equation follows from eq .   due to the intrinsic constancy of @xmath30 in the models ; now , however , something new has been added in that the observed be/@xmath28 ratio appears explicitly . in particular",
    ", we see that the scaling of @xmath24 with metallicity depends on the ratio of observed to predicted be/@xmath28 .",
    "if the observations are well matched by the predictions , then the ratio remains constant , as does @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , the constancy of @xmath24 is determined by the goodness of the be-@xmath28 fit .",
    "thus , _ all models which fit the data are able to avoid an energetics problem . _ this applies quite generally , to the models presented here as well as others ( e.g. , ramaty @xcite ) which fit the data .",
    "data will also satisfy the energy requirements in earlier epochs . ]",
    "this argument shows that the models in question are energetically sound , simply due to their agreement with the data ; however , a more detailed analysis is instructive .",
    "as we have argued , it is preferable to use the o data as the metal tracer @xmath28 , as this is the most direct diagnostic of beb origins .",
    "as we have emphasized , and shown in table [ bedata ] , the observational data clearly show that be / o is not constant , but rather @xmath31 , where the exact power depends on the atmospheric model used .",
    "this factor alone would lead to a _ decrease _ in @xmath24 at low metallicity .",
    "however , when the gcr is dominant over sap s , ( i.e. , for metallicities @xmath32 ) , the `` production efficiency '' factor scales as @xmath33 .",
    "this reflects the reduced efficiency for gcr be production in the early galaxy : the paucity of o targets in the early ism leads to a lower beb production for each supernova s complement of accelerated particles ; this factor alone would lead to an _ increase _ in @xmath34 thus , the first two factors in eq .",
    "offset each other , which is largely why @xmath24 is constant .",
    "we must consider several smaller and more subtle effects to complete our analysis of eq .  .",
    "the last factor in eq .",
    ", the `` average yield '' @xmath35 has a weak dependence on o , rising slightly towards low metallicity .",
    "however , we have until now assumed that @xmath36 .",
    "this is a good approximation in pop ii , where be evolution is dominated by production only , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "but in pop i , astration effects become important since many low - mass stars begin to die and return their astrated , be - free gas , which dilutes the ism be abundance .",
    "astration manifests itself in the be - o and be - fe relations by the turnover of be at high metallicity : be production is overtaken by destruction .",
    "thus , for pop i , the change in be gas mass is lower than the cosmic ray production term would give : @xmath38 .",
    "pop i be production is , in this respect , less efficient than in pop ii where astration is small and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the be-@xmath28 relation is flattened in pop i , and the extrapolation of @xmath24 via eq .",
    "back to pop ii overestimates the energy needed if this astration is neglected .",
    "finally , at very low metallicity , @xmath40 , the sap component takes over the energy budget .",
    "thus , just as sap s are primarily responsible for beb production below , they are also the dominant energy source in this range .",
    "finally , we consider using @xmath41 in eq .  .",
    "to reiterate , the question regarding the energetic problem , rests on @xmath24 .",
    "this quantity may be constant , even though @xmath42 is not constant , depending on the observed be / fe ratio and the ratio of be / fe produced .",
    "since the be - fe slopes are larger than ( though close to ) 1 , be / fe increases with fe .",
    "more significantly , the be / fe production ratio does not scale as fe itself , but rather @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , the iron yield per supernova may also not be constant if the yield of fe falls off at large stellar masses ( see fig [ fig : yields ] ) .",
    "both of these facts simply reflect the fact that o / fe is not constant in pop ii .",
    "thus , models in which @xmath45 is not constant , can not a priori be disregarded .",
    "the history of the accelerated particles within the galaxy is coded in the evolution of spallogenic be and b. recent theoretical studies of particle acceleration suggest that the galaxy may have two components of nonthermal particles .",
    "these two populations yield different beb evolution , gcr particles lead to secondary ( @xmath46 ) production , while nuclei accelerated in superbubbles give a primary ( @xmath47 ) production .",
    "we have searched for the corresponding evidence of two components in the evolution of be and b versus o and fe abundances in low metallicity halo stars .",
    "specifically , we have made two - component fits of abundance data , to identify the presence of primary and secondary beb components , and to quantify their relative strength .",
    "this analysis has been carried out using consistent stellar atmosphere parameters based on balmer lines and the infrared flux method ( irfm ) .",
    "some results depend on the method used to get the atmospheric parameters , while others do not . in both balmer and irfm methods ,",
    "the secondary beb component is seen to dominate for @xmath48 .",
    "however , the status of the primary component depends on the atmospheric parameters chosen .",
    "when the balmer treatment is used , a primary mechanism is not required over the observed metallicities , whereas it is required in the irfm2 case , where it dominates at @xmath49 .",
    "we use the beb - ofe fits to constrain the theories , whose predictions we model by combining cosmic ray nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution . the gcr component has the observed present - day spectrum , is assumed to be accelerated from supernovae , and to have a composition which scales with that of the ism . for the case of superbubbles , the energy spectrum has been taken from bykov ( 1999 ) , and is quite similar to the that of the gcrs . thus there a little hope to differentiate the two components on an isotopic basis , since the production ratios of superbubbles and gcr are very similar in spite of their different composition ( c / o = 0.09 against c / o = 0.81 respectively ) .",
    "the two - component beb - o fits constrain the models by demanding that : ( 1 ) the gcr production dominates over the superbubble component at @xmath50 in all cases , and in the balmer case it is unclear whether the sap component is needed ; ( 2 ) the secondary , gcr component requires that the mean gcr flux at present factor of 2.1 higher than current estimates ; given the uncertainties , this is quite plausible ; and ( 3 ) the is needed to produce 11 , but at a level that is 40% of the fiducial woosley & weaver yields ; again , this is well within the uncertainties of the yield calculations .",
    "our results can be further tested , and the constraints tightened , by several types of observations .",
    "simultaneous and high signal / noise measurements of be , b , o , and fe , are called for .",
    "these must be interpreted within detailed and consistent atmospheric models including accurate nlte corrections .",
    "the current situation is not definitive , since the conclusions regarding the primary component depend sensitively on the atmospheric parameters adopted .",
    "a critical goal is to determine be and b abundances  as well as key ratios such as b / be , li / be , and 11/10at very low metallicity , where the primary and secondary origins differ most in their predictions .",
    "it is just as important to firmly establish the nature and evolution of o / fe ; other metallicity indices , such as mg , could help to clarify this question .",
    "these should be analyzed systematically as we have tried to do with oxygen .",
    "gamma - ray line astronomy should also help to confirm the possibility of acceleration of freshly synthesized nuclei in superbubbles and ob associations .",
    "this will be a key objective for the european integral mission .",
    "thus , we are pleased to report that the nature of libeb evolution , is a problem that is ripe for new and precision observations , which can go far to reveal the origin and history of accelerated particles in the galaxy .",
