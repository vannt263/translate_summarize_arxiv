    "essentially , the energy density of excited phonons in each material drives the lattice expansion , since the electrons carry a negligible fraction of the specific heat , when the electrons have relaxed to approximately the lattice temperature .",
    "table 1 summarizes the @xmath47 constants of nb , y , as well as the spin and phonon systems of dy .",
    "these beta values are essentially independent of temperature , as confirmed exemplarily by the constant linear slopes of the curves @xmath48 plotted in fig . 2 of ref .",

    "[ eq : energydy ] and [ eq : strainsuperpositiondy ] to @xmath57 below @xmath49 we have four heat carrying degrees of freedom in the system , namely the spin - excitations in dy and the phonon - excitation in dy , nb and y. in addition to the three measured transient lattice strains @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uxrddata ] ) , we need a fourth equation to find the solution to the heat transport problem .",
    "we conducted temperature dependent ellipsometry measurements proving that the absorbed energy density of the multilayer does not change considerably with temperature . assuming that no substantial fraction of the initial heat is transported to the substrate",
    ", we can identify the total amount of energy deposited in the multilayer at any temperature @xmath59 with the value @xmath60 measured at @xmath61k , where only phonons drive the dy expansion .",
    "this is an excellent approximation for timescales below @xmath62ns and a very good appoximation up @xmath11ns , because the heat transport into the sapphire substrate is similar for all temperatures .",
    "when we write @xmath63 we only overestimate @xmath64 at low temperatures by the rather small fraction @xmath65 of heat that is transported into the substrate more than it would be transported at @xmath8k . for convenience",

    "we find that with lower base temperature a larger and larger fraction of the energy is rapidly transferred from the excited y layer into dy .",
    "we now solve eq .",
    "[ deltaqdy ] to obtain equations for the contractive strain @xmath67 driven by spin order and the phonon driven expansive strain @xmath68 , which only depend on measured quantities :    @xmath69    here , @xmath70 is the experimentally determined energy density plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhody]a ) .",
    "we can now use eq .",
    "[ eq : defbeta ] to derive the contributions to the time - dependent energy densities @xmath71 in dy .",
    "the corresponding energy densities @xmath72 of the adjacent layers are determined directly from the measured quantities @xmath73 .",

    "[ fig : rhody]c ) and compared to a simple calculation of the heat transport according to the heat equation .",
    "@xcite assuming a small thermal interface resistance of 200 mw / m@xmath74k only between nb and sapphire , we find a very good simultaneous agreement of the experimentally derived total energy density in dy @xmath75 and the simulations at @xmath8k and @xmath6k .",
    "in contrast , the simulated thermal expansion @xmath76 averaged over the film thickness ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : uxrddata]b ) considerably deviate from the measured strain @xmath77 , because the spin- and phonon - system are not even locally in thermal equilibrium .",
    "closer to the phase transition the deviations get stronger .",
    "heat transport is driven by temperature gradients .",
    "we therefore plot the transient temperature changes of the spins and phonons @xmath78 in dy and @xmath79 in fig . [",
    "fig : delt ] as the experimental solution of the heat transport problem through the three layers as a function of time for two temperatures above and below @xmath49 .",
    "we use the specific heats @xmath41 of the individual subsystems to calculate the temperature rise @xmath80 from @xmath81 .",
    "the most striking result is , that within the time resolution of @xmath11ps , we measure that the y layer is heated by @xmath82k at low and 68k at high temperature , although ellipsometry proves that the same amount of energy was deposited by the light pulse .",
    "this suggests that the additional energy dissipation channel into spin excitations at low temperatures dramatically speeds up the heat transport across the y / dy interface .",
    "another robust feature seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : delt ] is the delay of the temperature rise in the nb layer , indicating a reduced heat transport through dy .",
    "the temperature rise in the phonon system of dy at both base temperatures is nearly the same , and therefore the heat arriving in the spin system effectively is additional to the phonon heat , explaining the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhody]a ) that the increase of the energy density in dy is higher at low temperature .",
    "note that the kinetics of the temperature rise in the spin- and phonon - systems of dy are clearly different .",
    "the fact that energy density in the spin system of dy drives a lattice contraction counteracting the expansion initiated by phonon - heating explains the strong deviations of the observed lattice strain @xmath83 from the simulated strain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uxrddata]b ) when spins and phonons are not in a thermal equilibrium .",
    "the good agreement on the level of comparing the heat transport can be understood , when we identify the electrons as the main heat transporting quasiparticles .",
    "this means that a temperature - gradient in the electron system promotes the transport .",
    "immediately after the optical excitation , the energy is essentially stored in the electron system , with a very large temperature gradient according to the small heat capacity of electrons in dy . within the timescale of electron - phonon and electron - spin coupling",
    "the heat transport should therefore considerably speed up .",
    "this would then lead to an even better match of the simulations with the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhody]a ) .",
    "when the electron- , spin- and phonon temperatures have approached each other , the heat is essentially stored in spin excitations and phonons .",
    "nonetheless it is the electron system which transports the energy , explaining why we simulate the heat transport essentially correct , even if the spin and phonon system have not equilibrated .",
    "we have exemplified an experimental procedure to measure the heat transport through multilayer systems with thicknesses in the nanometer - range in the non - trivial case , where a considerable fraction of the heat of one material ( dy ) is dynamically stored in a strongly interacting spin system . at all temperatures ,",
    "the heat transport is dominated by electron transport , although electrons only contribute negligibly to the heat capacity . below the nel temperature ,",
    "the spin - system opens up an additional heat sink . while the heat transport into the phonon system is nearly unchanged ,",
    "the spins extract additional energy from the adjacent laser heated y layer and speed up the inital cooling . at the same time",
    "the spin - excitations slow down the electronic heat transport by electron - magnon scattering , which is evidenced by a delayed rise of the nb temperature , through which the heat is finally dissipated .",
    "although the average heat , experimentally measured in each layer , is in rather good agreement with standard simulations using the heat equation , there are strong deviations of simulated strain from the measured values .",
    "this is because a large fraction of the energy is stored in spin excitations which promote the contraction of the film . in general , for multilayer - systems where only electrons and phonons carry the heat , the transient temperatures can be directly read from the measured strains , which may be very useful when simulations fail to predict real situations e.g. rough interfaces . for even more complex situations , where several quasiparticles contribute to the heat transport and thermoelastic strain , we have shown how to analytically decompose the measured signal and get the correct decomposition of spin- and phonon contributions to the strain and the heat .",
    "a direct experimental assessment of the heat flow is crucial for understanding the heat transport via various quasi - particles and across interfaces .",
    "we believe that such direct experimental crosschecks of theoretical predictions yield valuable information when it comes to optimizing heat transport for real applications .",
