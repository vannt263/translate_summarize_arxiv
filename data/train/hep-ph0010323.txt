    "in order to obtain muon spectrum and value for integral muon flux at large depths where existing and planned neutrino telescopes are located ( one to several kilometers of water equivalent ) one has to perform several steps starting with interactions of primary cosmic rays in atmosphere .",

    "it can be done both with analytical or semianalytical technique and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation which directly takes into account that muon energy loss represents an essentially stochastic process .",
    "mc codes for muon transportation have to use some simplifications to optimize equilibrium between reasonable computation time , desirable accuracy and neccessary statistics .",
    "the usual approximation when calculating the muon propagation through a medium is the following : muon interactions with comparatively large energy transfers , i.e. , when fraction of energy lost @xmath0 exceeds some value @xmath1 10@xmath210@xmath3 , are taken into account by direct simulation of @xmath4 for each single interaction according to shape of differential cross sections @xmath5 ( these interactions lead to `` stochastic '' energy loss or sel ) while the part of interaction with relatively small @xmath6 is treated by the approximate concept of `` continuum '' energy loss ( cel ) , i.e. , using the function @xmath7_{cel}$ ] which is obtained from formula @xmath8 _ { cel } & \\ ! = & \\frac{n_{a}}{a}e \\left(\\ : \\int\\limits_{v_{min}^{\\gamma}}^{v_{cut}}\\frac{d\\sigma^{\\gamma}(e , v)}{dv}v\\,dv",

    "one is forced to decompose energy loss because simulation of all interactions with @xmath17 would result in infinite computation time due to steep dependence of muon cross sections on @xmath6 ( they decrease with @xmath6 at least as @xmath18 and for some processes are not finite at @xmath19 0 ) .",
    "number of interactions to be simulated per unit of muon path grows , roughly , as @xmath20 along with computation time .",
    "on the other hand , setting @xmath21 to large value may affect simulation accuracy .",
    "thus , the question is _ how large value of @xmath21 may be chosen to keep result within desirable accuracy _ ?",
    "the second problem can be formulated as follows : _ if it is necessary to include ionization in sel , at all _ ?",
    "small energy transfers strongly dominate at knock - on electron production ( @xmath22 ) , so this process is almost non - stochastic and it seems to be reasonable to omit the last term in expression for cel ( eq .  ( [ cl ] ) ) and",
    "exclude knock - on electrons from simulation procedure when simulating sel , i.e. , to treat ionization completely as `` continuous '' process which saves computation time noticeable .",
    "how much does it affect the result of simulation ?",
    "influence of these factors on simulated result was discussed in literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) but , in our opinion , more detailed analysis on which further improvement of muon propagation mc algorithms could be based is still lacking . in presented work we undertook an attempt to investigate in details with the mum ( muons+medium ) muon propagation code ( ref .",

    "description of the mum code which was used to obtain presented results has been published in ref .",
    "here we only dwell briefly on those features of the code which seem to be important in the frame of discussed problem :    * the most recent results on parametrizations for muon cross sections are used in the code ; * we tried to decrease the `` methodical '' part of systematic error due to interpolation , numerical integration , etc .",
    ", down to as low level as possible , especial attention was put on simulation procedures for free path and fraction of energy lost ; * the most important parameters , like value of @xmath21 , model for ionization loss , kind of medium , parametrizations for muon cross sections are changeable and represent input parameters for initiation routine ;    the accuracy of simulation algorithm used in mum was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be high enough to perform systematically significant analysis which is presented below .",
    "in order to study how different factors influence upon result of simulation we performed several sets of simulations both for propagation of monoenergetic muon beam and muons sampled by real sea - level spectrum ( in the later case we limited ourselves by simulation only vertical muons ) through pure water down to depths from @xmath23 1 km to @xmath23 40 km . of course , depths of more than several kilometers of water for vertical muons do not concern any real detector but simulations for larger depths allow us to study general appropriatenesses for large muon ranges which correspond , for instance , to nearly horizontal muons .",

    "the real accuracy of existing parametrization for muon cross sections is worse ( see refs .",

    "we fixed the muon spectra at final and several interim depths .",

    "the difference between survival probabilities for two models of ionization is the less appreciable the larger muon energy is .",
    "it is quite understandable because at muon energies @xmath50 1 tev ionization represents the great bulk of total energy loss , and vice versa , it becomes minor at @xmath51 1 tev .",
    "thus , contribution which is given by ionization at higher energies is small and , the more , its fluctuations do not play an important role . for muons with initial energies",
    "@xmath52 1 tev fluctuations in ionization become important only at very last part of muon path and `` are not in time '' to produce some noticeable effect .",
    "* generally , parametrizations ( [ bbpn ] ) and ( [ zeuspn ] ) do not show a noticeable difference in survival probabilities , in most cases it is within statistical error or exceeds it only slightly .",
    "* increase of @xmath21 gives effect of both signs in survival probabilities : function @xmath53 grows at the beginning of muon path and falls at the last part .",
    "the same `` both - sign '' dependencies are observed for ionization model . * for @xmath54 0.02  0.05 there is almost no dependence of survival probability on @xmath21 with the exception of very last part of muon path where survival probability becomes small .",
    "generally , dependence @xmath53 is the less strong the larger initial muon energy is .",
    "the last item is illustrated complementary by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which show that for all initial energies @xmath43 simulated survival probability does not depend , in fact , on @xmath21 until 90% ( for @xmath43 = 1 tev ) to 99.5% ( for @xmath43 = 10 pev ) muons have been stopped .",
    "it was shown above _ what is result _ of simulations with different models of ionization and values of @xmath21 .",
    "it was a special point of interest for us to track _ how does it _ influence upon behaviour of survival probability .",
    "[ fig4n ] shows how muon spectrum resulting from monoenergetic muon beam with initial energy @xmath43 = 1 tev transforms when propagating through pure water down to the depth of 3.2 km .",
    "simulated results for four settings of parameters are presented by four columns of plots .",
    "the first three columns represent spectra obtained with ionization included in sel for @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 , 10@xmath3 and 0.2 .",
    "4th column contains spectra simulated with entirely `` continuous '' ionization and @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 .",
    "the spectra grouped into the first column represent some `` ethalon '' because they were simulated with the most accurate tuning both for @xmath21 and ionization model .",
    "the first three columns demonstrate that `` compactness '' of spectra at the same depth is the higher the more value of @xmath21 is . put your attention to the right edge of spectra which shifts toward low energies when @xmath21 increases ( it is the most noticeably for @xmath21 = 0.2 ) .",
    "the reason is that at any depth energy of the most energetic muons in simulated beam is determined by cel .",
    "these muons due to statistical fluctuations did not undergo interactions with @xmath4 and , consequently , lost energy only by cel which increases when @xmath21 increases . that is why the maximum energy in simulated muon beam is lower for large values of @xmath21 .",
    "fraction of muons which did not undergo an `` catastrophic '' act with @xmath4 till given depth grows with increase of @xmath21 because free path between two sequential interactions with @xmath4 grows approximately as @xmath55 .",
    "it leads , in particular , to distinctly visible picks in spectra for @xmath21 = 0.2 consisted just of muons which lost energy only by cel .",
    "also , some deficit of low energy muons appears if one sets @xmath21 to a large value . in this case",
    "left edge of spectrum is provided only with muons which interacted with large fraction of energy lost while for smaller @xmath21 an additional fraction of muons comes here . as a result simulated spectrum of initial monoenergetic muons at given depth is more narrow if @xmath21 is large and , on the contrary , more wide if @xmath21 is small .",
    "now it is easy to understand how value of @xmath21 influences on simulated survival probabilities .",
    "when simulated muon beam goes through medium loosing energy both in cel and sel processes , its spectrum is constantly shifting to the left ( energy decreases ) . for @xmath21",
    "= 10@xmath30 the left part of spectrum reaches @xmath28 = 0 at a smaller depth comparing with larger @xmath21 ( because in this case spectrum is wider ) and survival probability starts to decrease . at the same depth survival probability for @xmath21 = 10@xmath3 and @xmath21 = 0.2",
    "is still equal to 1 .",
    "thus , for the first part of path the survival probability is always larger for large @xmath21 . at some depth ( which is equal to approximately 2.8 km for considered case ) compactness of spectra simulated with",
    "large @xmath21 starts to play an opposite role . due to this compactness and higher cel muons",
    "stop faster comparing with accurate simulation .",
    "so , at the final part of the beam path simulated survival probability for large @xmath21 decreases faster comparing with accurate simulation and , for instance , for @xmath21 = 0.02 the rest of muon beam which reaches the depth of @xmath44 = 2.72 km ( 37% of initial number of muons ) completely vanishes within the next 30 m of path , while some fraction of muons simulated with @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 ( 0.07% ) escapes down to the depth of @xmath44 = 3.2 km .",
    "qualitatively the same effect leads to the same results if one treats ionization as completely `` continuous '' energy loss .",
    "again , spectra becomes more narrow since fluctuations in ionization do not work and , as a consequence , survival probability becomes significantly higher comparing with simulation with accurate treatment of ionization at the beginning of muon beam path and falls down essentially faster at the final part of path .",
    "results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : mono ] show the significant influence which both model of ionization and value of @xmath21 have over survival probability for monoenergetic muon beam .",
    "but for practical purposes the more important is _",
    "how this factors do work for real atmospheric muons with a power spectrum _ ?      in fig .",
    "[ fig5n ] we present intensity of vertical atmospheric muon flux @xmath56 at different depths of pure water @xmath44 from 1 km to 20 km vs. @xmath21 as simulated with muons sampled according to sea - level spectrum ( [ bknsspec ] ) .",
    "simulation continued until 10@xmath57 muons reached given depth .",
    "curves for two models of ionization are shown for each depth along with results for @xmath42 = 1.00 @xmath49 0.01 at @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 , parametrization ( [ zeuspn ] ) at @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 , sea - level muon spectrum ( [ gaisspec ] ) at @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 and all energy loss treated entirely as cel ( for depths @xmath58 5 km only ) .",
    "general appropriatenesses for real muon spectrum are qualitatively the same as observed for monoenergetic muon beams .",
    "* for all depths at which neutrino telescopes are located it was found to be better to take into account fluctuations of energy loss simulated by _ any _ model than to treat energy loss as completely `` continuous '' : muon flux intensity computed with non - stochastical model of energy loss is always less comparing with stochastical model , the difference reaches 10 % at 3 km w.e . and",
    "40% at 5 km w.e .",
    "( at the depth of 20 km of pure water vertical muon flux computed with ignorance of fluctuations is only 10 % of simulated flux ) . *",
    "like in a case for monoenergetic beams 1%-uncertainty in muon cross sections plays the principal role for resulting error in simulated muon depth intensity .",

    "@xcite , does not lead to a significant difference in resulting intensity . * difference between muon spectra ( [ bknsspec ] ) and ( [ gaisspec ] ) leads to uncertainty from -4% ( @xmath44 = 1 km ) to 16% ( @xmath44 = 20 km ) . *",
    "error which appears due to simplified , entirely `` continuous '' ionization lies , commonly , at the level of 23 % .",
    "* dependence of simulated muon flux intensity upon @xmath21 is the most weak one comparing with other studied error sources .",
    "function @xmath59 is almost a constant if @xmath54 0.020.05 and changes in a range @xmath4912% which is very close to statistical error .",
    "we also tried to reveal how value of @xmath21 and model for ionization influence upon differential muon depth spectra .",
    "no differences were detected which would exceed statistical error .",
    "it is illustrated by two figures .",
    "[ fig6n ] displays simulated mean energies for vertical muon flux at different depths @xmath44 of pure water vs. @xmath21 as simulated with muons sampled according to sea - level spectrum ( [ bknsspec ] ) .",
    "two dependencies are presented at each depth for two model of ionization loss .",
    "no appropriatenesses are visible on the plot . in fig .",
    "[ fig7n ] we present simulated differential muon spectra at four depths @xmath44 = 1 km , 5 km , 10 km , 20 km .",
    "two spectra are displayed on each plot obtained _ i ) _ for the most accurate value of @xmath21 = 10@xmath30 and _ ii ) _ for the most rough case @xmath21 = 0.2 .",
    "spectra are normalized to 10@xmath57 muons and at each depth are divided into three parts along muon energy to keep linear scale at y - axis .",
    "again , no statistically significant differences are marked .",
    "results obtained in this work are evidence of accuracy in parametrizations for muon cross sections and spectra to be the principal source of uncertainties when simulating muon flux at depths where neutrino telescopes are located . both for monoenergetic muons and muons sampled according to a power spectrum it gives uncertainty at least of 24% to 10 - 15% in resulting intensity of muon flux , depending upon depth .",
    "unfortunately , this level has at present to be considered as a limit for accuracy of muon propagation codes .",
    "influence of model for ionization exceeds this limit only for monoenergetic muons with sea - level muon energies @xmath60 10 tev and only if level of observation is at very last stage of muon path where major fraction of initial muon energy has been lost .",
    "actually , due to steep shape of atmospheric muon power spectrum , an essential part of muons reaches detector location being just on the last part of path .",
    "therefore effect remains noticeable also for real atmospheric muons but in this case uncertainty was found in this work to be much less : 23% , which is in an excellent agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite predicts much more significant difference ( up to 17% ) .",
    "we suppose this disagreement may result from the fact that `` small transfer grouping '' technique used for simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite treats muon cross sections to be constant between two interactions in contrast with algorithm used in the mum code . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this case switching off the fluctuations in ionization leads to an additinal amplification in effective energy loss for muon energies @xmath61 1 tev and , consequently , simulated muon flux intensity must decrease at relatively small depths where muon spectrum is formed by muons with sea - level energies just in a range @xmath62 10@xmath4110@xmath63 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same simplification was used but reported reults were obtained by simulation with @xmath21 = 10@xmath2 . at this value of @xmath21 role of correct treatment for free path is not significant .",
    "choice of value for @xmath21 is of even less importance and again , it is more critical if one investigates monoenergetic muon beam but for power spectrum alteration in @xmath21 within @xmath54 0.020.05 leads only to 12% differences in simulated muon flux intensities which , again , is in a good agreement with level of errors reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "differences between muon flux intensities simulated for different models of ionization and values of @xmath21 , as obtained in given work and in refs .",
    "@xcite , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig9n ] and fig .",
    "[ fig10n ] .",
    "since computation time which is neccessary for simulation depends strongly upon used model of ionization loss and upon @xmath21 , it seems to be reasonable for most purposes to set @xmath21 to @xmath64 0.010.05 .",
    "anyway , in this case resulting error will be less comparing with error caused by accuracy of parametrization for muon cross sections and sea - level muon spectrum , if one treats free path @xmath65 by an accurate method ( ref .",
    "note that `` inner '' accuracy of the mum code was found to be worse than `` outer '' one ( which results from uncertainties of muon cross sections ) if ionization is set to `` continuous '' model and @xmath31 10@xmath3 . for fluctuated ionization inner accuracy remains high enough at least till @xmath21 = 0.05 ( ref .",
    "so , using mum one should set @xmath21 to @xmath54 0.01 if ionization is entirely continuous and to @xmath54 0.05 for ionization included in sel . for test runs it is possible to set @xmath21 even to larger values .",
    "on the other hand for some methodical purposes it may be useful to simulate fluctuations in knock - on electron production and choose more fine @xmath21 , e.g. , if one wants to exclude an additional error when comparing results of simulations for different models of muon sea - level spectrum with each other .",
    "it is impossible to consider all particular cases and give some strict conformity between setting of parameters at muon mc propagation code and problem to be solved .",
    "we had for an object to create a code which would allow to change easy the most important parameters and to perform an analysis which would allow anyone to choose these parameters according to one s purposes and taste .",
    "we hope this object has been achieved with this article .",
