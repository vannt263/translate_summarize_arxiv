    "the simplest generalizations of frw braneworlds are bianchi braneworlds .    by making an assumption about the weyl term on the brane",
    ", the dynamics of a bianchi type  i brane were studied in  @xcite , and it was shown that high - energy effects from extra - dimensional gravity remove the anisotropic behaviour near the singularity that is found in general relativity .",

    "it was then suggested that this may be generic in cosmological braneworlds , which was supported by subsequent work  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "this fact can be seen from the relative shear eigenvalues , @xmath251 this is illustrated by examples  i and ii , where in the future the brane isotropizes .",
    "by contrast , in example  iii the brane approaches frw in the past .",
    "a striking feature of our models is that geometric anisotropy on the brane , from the bianchi symmetry , imposes via the bulk curvature and the junction conditions , anisotropy on the matter content of the brane . in other words , it is not possible within our family of models to have a perfect fluid matter content ( including the case of a minimally coupled scalar field )  anisotropic pressure in the matter is unavoidable unless the brane geometry reduces to friedmann isotropy .",
    "this feature may be a consequence of the simplicity of the bulk metric ansatz that we used , but it raises an interesting challenge , i.e. , to find complete bianchi brane - world solutions with perfect fluid matter and nonzero anisotropy .",
