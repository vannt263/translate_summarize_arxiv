    "thermoelastic noise will be the dominant noise source in the advanced ligo interferometers for frequencies at which they are most sensitive , should the advanced ligo upgrade follow the baseline design @xcite . other noise processes ( e.g. , conventional bulk thermal noise ; coating thermal noise ; unified optical noise ) could be important , but are expected to be smaller in noise power , by a factor @xmath0 ( at the minimum of the noise curve ) , than thermoelastic noise . as a result , the sensitivity of the advanced ligo interferometers can be significantly increased .    in a companion paper  the mesa - beam interferometer paper ( mbi ) @xcite , summarized briefly in a short ligo technical document ( mbi - s ) @xcite  we and our collaborators have argued that a significant reduction in thermoelastic noise can be achieved by using modified optics that reshape the beam from a conventional ( gaussian ) profile into a _ mesa - beam _ shape .",
