    "in the course of the last three decades , spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has proven to be a valuable tool in the experimental investigation of fundamental properties of the electromagnetic field in the quantum domain @xcite , including nonclassical correlations , entanglement and nonlocality .",
    "the fact that spdc is capable of generating pairs of photons in a wide range of frequencies and wave vectors , in addition to the fact that these photons may be entangled in a number of different degrees of freedom , qualifies spdc also as a unique tool in the demonstration of quantum information procedures and protocols @xcite .    in many applications , especially in the pioneering ones ,",
    "a basic knowledge of a few properties of the two - photon states generated by spdc is enough to explain the effects discussed .",
    "as the applications become more sophisticated , for example in those that combine correlations in more than one degree of freedom , a more comprehensive approach is necessary in order to enhance the capabilities of quantum state engineering . in this direction ,",
    "the use of fourier optics concepts in two - photon optics represents a significant step .",
    "an important application field of spdc is the construction of entangled photon state sources with high fidelity and purity @xcite . in order to obtain efficient and dependable two - photon sources ,",
    "a number of questions must be addressed , as for example , phase compensation , mode coupling , pair collection efficiency , maximum photon flux , etc .",
    "to be optimized , all these points require a detailed knowledge of the spdc process .",
    "another context in which a more precise model is crucial refers to the issue of conservation of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light in the process of spdc @xcite .",
    "oversimplifications or inconsistent assumptions about the two - photon state generated have led to conflicting conclusions on whether oam is conserved or not in spdc .    in this work , we present a detailed account of the two - photon states generated by spdc in both type i and type ii phase matching , including the effects of anisotropy of the nonlinear medium and the frequency spread of the down - converted fields . as an exact approach to this problem presents a considerable level of difficulty , we are forced to restrict ourselves to some approximations .",
    "we adhere to the commonly adopted simplified procedure for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the nonlinear medium by just multiplying the @xmath0 vectors by the corresponding refractive indices and keeping the vacuum expressions for the field operators .",
    "the frequency spread of the down - converted fields is considered to be small compared to their central frequencies .",
    "we also work in the paraxial approximation , in which the propagation of the fields is much easier to deal with .",
    "fortunately , these approximations , are good enough to encompass a great number of practical cases .",
    "we admit , however , that while the model discussed here is helpful in far field applications , it may not be appropriate in discussions of the fundamental interactions inside the nonlinear medium . whenever possible , the results reported here are compared with experimental data , obtained in our labs or reported in the literature .    it should be mentioned that other authors have reported their contributions to this field , in different levels of detail and scope @xcite . from our point of view , a comprehensive description of spdc that accounts for all features observed so far in two - photon states , with expressions ready to use in fourier optics , is still missing .",
    "it is in this context that we present our work .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian describing the optical processes of parametric down - conversion in nonlinear birefringent crystals is usually written in terms of a simplified field quantization in matter @xcite .",
    "the field modes participating in this process are coupled by the second - order susceptibility tensor @xmath1 . due to the phase matching conditions ,",
    "the coupling occurs only for some sets of polarizations , known as type i and type ii . in negative uniaxial crystals ( @xmath2 ) such as bbo ( @xmath3bab@xmath4o@xmath5 ) and lithium iodate ( liio@xmath6 ) , the down - conversion process with type i phase matching",

    "the ( post - selected ) two - photon state generated by spdc is written as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the wave vectors of the down - converted fields , @xmath13 is the wave vector of the pump field , whose frequency @xmath14 is assumed to be well defined .",

    "the frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath44 can therefore be written as    @xmath45    this assumption can be justified by the use of a moderate power continuous - wave pump laser so that the time interval between two down - conversions is large compared to the detection resolving time .",
    "( _ b _ ) the frequency spread of the detectable down - converted fields is small compared to the central frequency ( @xmath46 ) , so that the dispersion of the refractive indices around the central frequency @xmath47 is small and a linear approximation can be used .",
    "this assumption is justified by the use of narrow - band interference filters in front of the detectors .",
