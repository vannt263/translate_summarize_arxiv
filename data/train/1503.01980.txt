    "grbs are explosive cosmic gamma - ray emissions , with typical energy fluxes of the order of @xmath0 to @xmath1 j m@xmath2 , and durations that range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 s @xcite . since their distribution is isotropic , they are believed to have a cosmological origin , being located at extra - galactic distances @xcite .",
    "the observable effects of grbs are produced by the dissipation of kinetic energy from a relativistically expanding plasma , though the underlying progenitor model is , as yet , unknown .",
    "reviews and discussion of new models may be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the detection of x - ray flares in nearly half of the observed grb afterglows @xcite has added a new mystery to the grb puzzle .",
    "the present astrophysical observations suggest that the central engines of bursts , after the gamma - ray emission has ended , still have long periods of activity , during which energetic explosions eject relativistic materials , leading to late - time x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the grb observations show that strong magnetic fields play a key role during the acceleration of the outflow and the prompt emission @xcite , while any remaining magnetization at large distance can affect the interactions of the flow with the external medium .",
    "a statistical analysis of the x - ray flares of grbs with known redshifts was performed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that x - ray flares and solar flares share three statistical properties : a ) power - law energy frequency distributions , b ) power - law duration - time frequency distributions , and c ) power - law waiting time distributions , respectively .",
    "all these distributions can be well understood within the physical framework of a magnetic reconnection - driven _ self - organized criticality system_. these statistical similarities , together with the fact that solar flares are triggered by a magnetic reconnection process taking place in the atmosphere of the sun , suggest that x - ray flares originate from magnetic reconnection - driven events possibly involved in ultra - strongly magnetized millisecond pulsars @xcite .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite it was already proposed that grb x - ray flares may be powered by magnetic reconnection events .",
    "magnetic reconnection may occur near the photosphere if the outflow develops an alternating field structure due to e.g. magnetic instabilities or a misalignment between the magnetic and rotation axes .",
    "the magnetic dissipation model is favoured by observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the numerous spatial extended systems , which exhibit a number of properties which may be shortly characterized as flicker noise for the temporal evolution and self - similar ( fractal ) behavior for the spatial evolution can be organized under the same principle of nature , namely as systems in the state of _ self organized criticality _",
    "( soc ) @xcite .",
    "there is a lot of literature covering the aspects of soc in astrophysics  ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , ranging from simple but effective numerical models  @xcite , to sophisticated analytical models as in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the possible areas of physics in which these models prove to reproduce observational data is very wide .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that soc may be an underlying principle in nature , as the initial intuition of  @xcite stated .",
    "examples in astrophysics include organization of plasma in accretion discs  @xcite to explain observational data such as those discussed in  @xcite , axion clouds around black hole  @xcite , solar flares  @xcite .",
    "@xcite have analyzed grb x - ray data , and they did find that all observational results can be fitted into a framework based on a stochastic pulse avalanche model running in a near - critical regime .",
    "their reasoning is reproduced here : 1 .",
    "all grbs can be described as different random realizations of the same simply organized stochastic process within narrow ranges of the parameters of the process .",
    "2 . the stochastic process should be scale invariant in time .",
    "the stochastic process works near its critical regime .",
    "this would explain the large morphological diversity of grbs .",
    "they propose that the flaring events are based on magnetic reconnection , but their simulations do not include evolution equations for magnetic fields . while this type of statistics of data can be explained by turbulence ,",
    "the analysis performed by  @xcite is clearly in favour of a self organized criticality model .",
    "it is the goal of the present paper to investigate from the point of view of soc one dimensional magnetized systems undergoing slow driving .",
    "more specifically , this study aims at describing a specific behaviour , i.e. , that of magnetic field on a space scale that is global . thus we do not attempt to solve the mhd equations nor do we even take all of them into account .",
    "we focus on the magnetic field as a being a relevant parameter , since it is a field that couples to the radiation field and since radiation is our main source of information on astrophysical sources .",
    "also , the magnetic field is a parameter that exhibits a transition in its behaviour and this transition can be explained based on the laplacian of the magnetic field reaching a critical value .",
    "the evolution equation for this parameter is the magnetic induction equation , which describes the time behaviour of a magnetic field in a resistive plasma medium in which the mhd approximation holds  @xcite , with a background flow .",
    "magnetic reconnection was investigated independently of the idea of soc as a natural phenomenon occurring in all branches of astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a change in the magnetic field topology when the value of a certain parameter locally reaches a threshold value .",
    "the change in topology occurs fundamentally because the configuration is no longer of minimum energy .",
    "a part or all of the excess energy is lost to radiation .",
    "extension of the idea of magnetic reconnection to soc is nothing more but moving from the local scale of the reconnection site to the entire system .",
    "so conceptually soc in a magnetized environment is expected and it is thought to be the answer to many unanswered questions in astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "this expectation was confirmed by observational data of solar flares ( a review of theory and data is presented in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : soc ] we introduce the magnetic induction equation for plasma flows , and we present its one - dimensional version .",
    "the discretization of the induction equation as well as the simulation procedure is presented in section  [ disc ] .",
    "the results of our simulations for one dimensional magnetic flows and the establishment of the soc are presented in section  [ sect : sims ] .",
    "the applications of the model for the study of grb afterglows are briefly presented in section  [ grb ] .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in sections  [ discussion ] and  [ concl ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to investigate whether or not soc is possible in a one dimensional magnetic field set - up .",
    "the set of magnetohydrodynamic equations which ( under some assumptions regarding the ratio of microscopic and macroscopic time - and - space scales ) analytically describe general magnetized flows are inhomogeneous nonlinear partial - differential equations , which are sometimes anisotropic .",
    "numerical techniques to solve this set of equations have evolved , but one still can not solve them in full generality not even locally .",
    "cellular automata ( ca ) simulations are a valid alternative to the full numerical treatment when only qualitative and quantitative answers of a specific kind are sought for .",
    "in such a setup the velocity profile has not been consistently included , to our knowledge .",
    "in fact , most of the times it has been considered nonexistent and the convective part was replaced by a stochastic loading phase .",
    "the following treatment aims at a middle ground between ignoring the flow completely and the exact numerical solution of the equation ( not accessible to a ca of this type ) .",
    "the skeleton of our approach to calculating the stress , number of events and released energy has been used in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite ; the novelty in this work is explicitly taking into account the background flow characteristic to grbs .",
    "thus we consider the induction equation @xmath5 and define the control parameter as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the magnetic field , @xmath8 is the flow velocity , @xmath9 is the constant plasma resistivity and the notation @xmath10 denotes the number of nearest neighbours in the configuration .    the set - up consists of a flux tube aligned with the @xmath11 axis of a system of coordinates fixed at the footpoint of the tube .",
    "a magnetic field is present , @xmath12 and we allow for a background flow @xmath13 .",
    "we emphasize that the setup is thus two dimensional . in this setup , with @xmath14 , the magnetic induction equation and the control parameter become @xmath15    in astrophysical conditions the classical resistivity is very small and the magnetic field behaves macroscopically as if the diffusion term in the magnetic induction equation would be zero .",
    "this behaviour is dictated by the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are characteristic velocity and space - scale respectively .",
    "however , under certain conditions , in relatively small volumes , the diffusive behaviour becomes dominant and the magnetic field lines reconnect . to model this in our grid",
    ", we shall assume that the physics occurs in two different regimes and the switch between these two regimes is dictated by the behaviour of the control parameter .",
    "the control parameter tells us what is the value of the difference between the magnetic field between one grid point and its neighbours . by definition",
    "this control parameter is thus local , and its characteristic scale @xmath19 is very small .",
    "if @xmath18 is the characteristic length scale of the simulation , then in our case @xmath20 is at least @xmath21 .",
    "if the control parameter exceeds a certain threshold , then what happens locally becomes worthwhile inspecting . since we may assume the velocity does not change in order of magnitude , and since the diffusivity @xmath9 is constant ( the plasma does not change ) , the ratio between the macroscopic reynolds number and that of the local reynolds number is of the same order of @xmath20",
    "this can be viewed as a reason why the control parameter changes the behaviour of the reynolds number .",
    "to summarise , the convective behaviour is the main framework . if the control parameter becomes critical the magnetic field evolution is given , for a brief period of time , by a diffusive behaviour .",
    "once this local criticality is relaxed , control is given back to the convective behaviour .",
    "stated more clearly , the induction equation is @xmath22    we denote the term @xmath23 in by @xmath24 and consider it as a stochastic source term .",
    "equations   are brought to dimensionless form by the transformations @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a characteristic timescale , @xmath31 is the characteristic magnetic field , @xmath32 is the a characteristic length scale defined here as the distance travelled in time @xmath30 by a perturbation moving with alfven velocity @xmath33 in a medium with a characteristic magnetic field equal to @xmath31 , and @xmath34 is the initial velocity of the flow .    with these parameters ,",
    "the diffusive description becomes @xmath35 while the convective description becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 ; the dimensionless expression for the control parameter is @xmath38",

    "we find that the bursting behaviour is well reproduced by a model with convective behaviour of the type @xmath148 and a large ratio of initial - to - alfven velocity ( fig  [ fig : obs ] ) .",
    "in assessing the importance of the chosen velocity profile with respect to reproducing observational data , there are two aspects which can be discussed separately : 1 ) reproduction of the 1d event size distribution and 2 ) reproduction of observed emitted energy ( light curve ) . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : d(n ) ] , the model reproduces the expected event size distribution , regardless of the velocity scaling law considered .",

    "there are several issues which must be stressed regarding this toy model .",
    "first , the model seems to show that there is a possibility that in real phenomena magnetic reconnection occurs in an one dimensional set - up .",
    "second , the already known problem of representation in a cellular automata : have we really represented the magnetic field and its dynamics ?    in real natural phenomena",
    "one dimensional magnetic reconnection is not in agreement with maxwell s , and subsequently with the mhd , equations .",
    "one always needs at least two independent vectors in a basis to be able to describe the physics of magnetic reconnection - and in fact there exist 2d mhd setups that do this job @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that in stochastic magnetic reconnection magnetic field line wanderings occur in a random fashion , leading to increased reconnection velocity .",
    "they calculate the ratio of the wandering length to the main direction of the magnetic field and this ratio is very small .",
    "this is how the toy model presented in this work should be regarded .",
    "our one dimensional grid obscures the fine details of the phenomenon and follow the macroscopic evolution of the system in agreement with some microscopic laws ; and this is what cellular automata do .",
    "we place this issue in the `` _ sweep the microscopic physics under the rug _ ''",
    "category .",
    "the question of representation is what can now be called an `` old '' problem . in a classical three dimensional setup",
    "it has already been shown that a ca where the represented variable is the vector potential , one can claim that both qualitative and quantitative data can be extracted  @xcite .",
    "this is also valid for representing the magnetic field directly , with the only problem that @xmath149 can not be controlled , but its validity can be checked a - posteriori , during the simulations .    in short , this model does not claim to do anything more than provide a ca approach to a convection plus critical diffusion equation , stemming from the set of mhd equations written for a two - dimensional configuration .",
    "this solution , at least qualitatively , fits the one dimensional self organized criticality signature inferred from observations and theory .",
    "following the suggestion by @xcite that x - ray flares in grbs originate from magnetic reconnection - driven events , we have investigated the possibility of formation of self - organized criticality in an one dimensional magnetized fluid flow . as mentioned in @xcite , such a work `` ... could not only help to understand the central engines of grbs , but also help to study applications of solar magnetic - reconnection theories . '' in the present paper we have adopted a simplified theoretical approach for the study of magnetic reconnection , which is based on the one - dimensional form of the magnetic induction equation , with the background flow explicitly included . in the induction equation",
    "we have considered the term @xmath150 as a stochastic source term , and we have constructed an equivalent cellular automaton model to describe the evolution of the magnetized plasma flow , as well as its energy emission .    our analysis , based on computing the event size distribution and the fact that a grid averaged value of the critical parameter stabilises to a constant value during the simulations , concludes that soc appears in a one - dimensional magnetized setup with background flow . this result was not unexpected , as the onset of magnetic reconnection is threshold dependent and many observational and theoretical efforts , together with simulations have established that observational data can be explained by a self - organizing ( dynamical ) spread of reconnection events .",
    "even more , soc seems to be an underlying principle of nature .",
    "one novel pillar in this line of thought has been set by the observational analysis performed by @xcite , and sustained by previous efforts to explain the diversity of grbs through one single principle .",
    "this is why the possibility of the application of the present model to the grbs afterglows was also briefly considered .",
    "both qualitative and quantitative results show that the same grid , equipped with the same evolution law is able to produce a large diversity of light curves ( e.g. , fig .",

    "<S> a simplified one dimensional grid is used to model the evolution of magnetized plasma flow . </S>",
    "<S> we implement diffusion laws similar to those so - far used to model magnetic reconnection with cellular automata . as a novelty , we also explicitly superimpose a background flow . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to numerically investigate the possibility that self - organized criticality appears in a one dimensional magnetized flow . </S>",
    "<S> the cellular automaton s cells store information about the parameter relevant to the evolution of the system being modelled . under the assumption that this parameter stands for the magnetic field , the magnetic energy released by one volume during one individual relaxation event is also computed . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that indeed in this system self - organized criticality is established . </S>",
    "<S> the possible applications of this model to the study of the x - ray afterglows of grbs is also briefly considered .    </S>",
