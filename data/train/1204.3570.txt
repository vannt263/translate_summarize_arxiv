    "there has been extensive work in recent decades on the definition and use of the expectation value of a quantum stress tensor operator .",
    "when this expectation value is used as the source in the einstein equations , the resulting semiclassical theory gives an approximate description of the effects of quantum matter fields upon the gravitational field .",
    "this theory gives , for example , a plausible description of the backreaction of hawking radiation on black hole spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "however , the semiclassical theory does not describe the effects of quantum fluctuations of the stress tensor around its expectation value .",
    "quantum stress tensor fluctuations and the resulting passive fluctuations of gravity have been the subject of several papers in recent years   @xcite . however , most of these papers deal with effects described by the correlation function of a pair of stress tensor operators , and ignore higher - order correlation functions .",
    "one way to include these higher - order correlations is through the probability distribution of a smeared stress tensor operator .",
    "this distribution was given recently for gaussian averaged conformal stress tensors in two - dimensional flat spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this result will be discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : sgd ]",
    ". a recent attempt to define probability distributions for quantum stress tensors in four dimensions was made by duplancic , _ et al _",
    "@xcite . however , these authors attempt to define distributions for stress tensor operators at a single spacetime point . because such operators do not have well - defined moments , the resulting probability distribution is not well - defined . in our view ,",
    "only temporal or spacetime averages of quantum stress tensors have meaningful probability distributions in four dimensions .",
    "furthermore , these averages should be normal ordered , resulting in a zero mean for the vacuum probability distribution and a nonzero probability of finding negative values .",
    "none of these conditions are satisfied by the distribution proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain information about the form of the probability distribution for averaged stress tensors in four - dimensional spacetime from calculations of a finite set of moments .",
    "this method was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to infer the distribution for @xmath0 , with lorentzian averaging , where @xmath1 is a massless scalar field four - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the result matches a shifted gamma distribution to extremely high numerical accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , the probability distribution of the smeared energy density for massless scalar and electromagnetic fields can not be found so precisely . however , under certain assumptions to be detailed later , we are able to give approximate lower bounds and asymptotic tails for these cases , and to give a rough fit to the intermediate part of the distribution .",
    "an important point arises here . throughout this paper ,",
    "all quadratic operators are understood to be normal - ordered with respect to the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "however , the smeared normal ordered operators are defined , in the first instance , only as symmetric operators on a dense domain in the hilbert space ( assuming a real - valued smearing function ) and it is possible that there is more than one way of extending them to provide self - adjoint operators - particle wavefunctions in fock space . ] the operators of greatest interest to us are bounded from below on account of quantum inequalities ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : qi ] ) and so there is a distinguished friedrichs extension ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , theorem x.23 ) , whose lower bound coincides with the sharpest possible quantum inequality bound .",
    "it is this operator that we have in mind when we discuss the probability distribution of individual measurements of the smeared operator in the vacuum state . the question of whether there is more than one self - adjoint extension , i.e. , whether the normal ordered expressions fail to be essentially self - adjoint , is nontrivial and not fully resolved .",
    "recent results ( not , however , immediately applicable to our situation ) and references may be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if there are distinct self - adjoint extensions , their corresponding probability distributions will all share the same moments in the vacuum state .",
    "this links to the wider issue of whether or not the moments of the probability distribution determine the distribution uniquely .",
    "there is a rich theory concerning this question , which is reviewed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed below , some of the moments we study grow too fast to be covered by well - known sufficient criteria ( due to hamburger and stieltjes ) for uniqueness .",
    "this does not prove that the distribution is nonunique ( nor would the existence of distinct self - adjoint extensions prove nonuniqueness ) and we have not been able to resolve the question of uniqueness .",
    "however , in sect .",
    "[ sect : cdf ] we prove that _ any _ probability distribution with the moments we find has a cumulative distribution function close to that corresponding to the fitted asymptotic tail . as various applications ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and sect .",
    "[ sec : apps ] ) depend only on the rough form of the tail , the possible lack of uniqueness is not as crucial as might be thought .",
    "further discussion of this point can be found in sect .",
    "[ sec : unique ] .",
    "here we will briefly summarize selected aspects of two topics , quantum inequality bounds on expectation values , and known results for probability distributions .",
    "both of these related topics are important for the present paper .",
    "quantum inequalities are lower bounds on the smeared expectation values of quantum stress tensor components in arbitrary quantum states  . in two - dimensional spacetime",
    ", the sampling may be over either space , time , or both . in four dimensions",
    ", there must be a sampling either over time alone , or over both space and time , as there are no lower bounds on purely spatially sampled operators  @xcite . here",
    "we will be concerned with sampling in time alone , in which case a quantum inequality takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normal - ordered quadratic operator , which is classically non - negative , and @xmath4 is a sampling function with characteristic width @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is a numerical constant , typically small compared to unity , and @xmath7 is the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "although quantum field theory allows negative expectation values of the energy density , quantum inequalities place strong constraints on the effects of this negative energy for violating the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite , maintaining traversable wormholes  @xcite or warpdrive spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "the implication of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) is that there is an inverse power relation between the magnitude and duration of negative energy density .    for a massless scalar field in two - dimensional spacetime ,",
    "flanagan  @xcite has found a formula for the constant @xmath6 for a given @xmath4 which makes eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) an optimal inequality , and has constructed the quantum state in which the bound is saturated .",
    "this formula is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is the @xmath11 special case of a general result for unitary , positive energy , conformal field theories in two dimensions , where @xmath12 is the central charge , in which the left - hand side of   is multiplied by @xmath12  . in four - dimensional spacetime , fewster and eveson  @xcite",
    "have derived an analogous formula for @xmath6 , but in this case the bound is not necessarily optimal .",
    "here we briefly recall the main results of ref .",
    "first , we determined the probability distribution for individual measurements , in the vacuum state , of the gaussian sampled energy density @xmath13 of a general conformal field theory in two - dimensions .",
    "this was achieved by finding a closed form expression for the generating function of the moments @xmath14 of @xmath15 , from which the probability distribution was obtained by inverting a laplace transform .",
    "the resulting distribution is conveniently expressed in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath16 and is a shifted gamma distribution : @xmath17 with parameters @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the infimum of the support of the probability distribution , which we will often call the _ lower bound of the distribution _ , and @xmath20 is the central charge , which is equal to unity for the massless scalar field . using the binomial theorem and standard integrals , the @xmath21th moment @xmath22 of @xmath23",
    "is easily found to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a generalized hypergeometric function .",
    "the lower bound , @xmath26 , for the probability distribution for energy density fluctuations in the vacuum for @xmath11 is exactly flanagan s optimum lower bound , eq .  ( [ eq : flanagan ] ) , on the gaussian sampled expectation value and , for all @xmath20 , coincides with the result of ref .  .",
    "as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is a general feature , giving a deep connection between quantum inequality bounds and stress tensor probability distributions .",
    "the quantum inequality bound is the lowest eigenvalue of the sampled operator , and is hence the lowest possible expectation value and the smallest result which can be found in a measurement . that the probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations actually extends down to this value is more subtle and depends upon special properties of the vacuum state .",
    "in essence , the reeh - schlieder theorem implies a nonzero overlap between the vacuum and the generalized eigenstate of the sampled operator with the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "there is no upper bound on the support of @xmath27 , as arbitrarily large values of the energy density can arise in vacuum fluctuations .",
    "nonetheless , for the massless scalar field , negative values are much more likely ; 84% of the time , a measurement of the gaussian averaged energy density will produce a negative value .",
    "however , the positive values found the remaining 16% of the time will typically be much larger , and the average [ first moment of @xmath27 ] will be zero .    the asymptotic positive tail of @xmath27 has recently been used by carlip _",
    "@xcite to draw conclusions about the small scale structure of spacetime in a two - dimensional model .",
    "these authors argue that large positive energy density fluctuations tend to focus light rays on small scales , and cause spacetime to break into many causally disconnected domains at scales somewhat above the planck length .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also reported on calculations of the moments of @xmath29 averaged with a lorentzian , where @xmath1 is a massless scalar field in four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "it appears that the probability distribution is also a shifted gamma function in this case .",
    "define a dimensionless variable @xmath30 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 there is good evidence that the probability distribution is to be eq .",
    "( [ eq : shifted_gamma ] ) with the parameters @xmath33 these parameters were determined empirically by fitting to the first three calculated moments . however , the resulting distribution matches the first sixty - five moments exactly ( agreement had been checked up to the twentieth moment at the time of writing of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so there can little doubt that it is correct .",
    "the details of this calculation are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : moments ] and appendix  [ appx : comp ] .",
    "furthermore , the probability distribution for both the two - dimensional stress tensor and the four - dimensional @xmath29 is uniquely determined by its moments , as a consequence of the hamburger moment theorem  @xcite .",
    "this states that if @xmath34 is the @xmath21-th moment of a probability distribution @xmath27 , then there is no other probability distribution with the same moments provided there exist constants @xmath6 and @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for all @xmath21 .",
    "this condition is a sufficient , although not necessary , condition for uniqueness , and is fulfilled by the moments of the shifted gamma distribution .",
    "the hamburger moment theorem is also an existence result : given a real sequence @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 , such that the @xmath40-matrix @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is strictly positive definite for every @xmath43 , then there exists at least one associated probability distribution for which the @xmath34 are the moments .",
    "in this section , we describe how the moments of a quadratic quantum operator may be calculated explicitly .",
    "let @xmath44 be a free quantum field or a derivative of a free field , and let @xmath3 be the smeared normal ordered square of @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a sampling function . in our detailed calculations , the smearing will be in time only , and @xmath47 will be the lorentzian function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lorentzian ] ) , but our preliminary discussion can be more general . the @xmath21-th moment @xmath48 of @xmath3 is formed by smearing the vacuum expectation value @xmath49 over @xmath21 copies of @xmath46 . by wick",
    "s theorem , this quantity is equal to the sum of all contractions of the form @xmath50 the contractions are subject to the rules that no @xmath51 is contracted with the other copy of itself and all fields are contracted , with each contraction @xmath52 contributing a factor @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to represent the contractions by graphs with @xmath21 vertices labelled @xmath54 placed in order from left to right so that ( 1 ) every vertex is met by exactly two lines ; ( 2 ) every line is directed , pointing to the right ; ( 3 ) no vertex is connected to itself by a line . for each graph",
    "every line from @xmath55 to @xmath56 contributes the factor @xmath57 and we supply a combinatorial factor that gives the number of contractions represented by a given graph ; we then sum over all distinct graphs of the above type to obtain @xmath58 .",

    "it is convenient to rescale the @xmath48 and define dimensionless moments @xmath34 .",
    "our explicit calculations of moments assume the lorentzian sampling function of width @xmath5 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lorentzian ] ) . in the case that @xmath68 , the massless scalar field in four dimensions , we take @xmath69 for the case that @xmath70 , we take @xmath71 we also take the latter form for the cases of the squared electric field , and scalar and electromagnetic field energy densities .",
    "for @xmath72 , the wick expansion involves both connected and disconnected graphs .",
    "however , we need not consider the disconnected graphs explicitly , as the moment generating function @xmath73 is the exponential of @xmath74 , the generating function for the connected graphs .",
    "the full moment generating function is defined by @xmath75 so the @xmath21-th moment has the expression @xmath76 the connected moment generating function , @xmath74 , has an analogous definition , but in terms of the dimensionless connected moments @xmath77 only .",
    "these are the moments which arise from counting only connected graphs . for @xmath60",
    ", there is a single connected graph , with combinatorial factor @xmath78 as already described . for @xmath79 , there are @xmath80 distinct connected graphs , each with a combinatorial factor @xmath81   terms in the wick expansion for @xmath79 as follows .",
    "choose one of the lines emanating from @xmath82 , which can correspond to any of four possible contractions .",
    "continuing around the diagram , each line can correspond to two possible contractions until the last line , which is fixed .",
    "thus a total of @xmath83 contractions are represented by each graph . ] .",
    "of course , the enumeration of these graphs becomes rapidly unmanageable , and one must exploit further degeneracies among the graphs to reduce the counting . for sampling using the lorentzian function , it is possible to reduce the number of terms to the number of distinct partitions of @xmath21 into an even number of terms .",
    "this grows much more slowly than @xmath80 : for example , for @xmath84 , we require @xmath85 terms instead of @xmath86 .",
    "further details can be found in appendix  [ appx : comp ]    our procedure will be to explicitly compute a finite number @xmath87 of connected moments , which allows @xmath74 to be approximated as an @xmath87-th degree polynomial in @xmath88 .",
    "we then use @xmath89 to find @xmath73 , which may also be approximated as an @xmath87-th degree polynomial . finally , the first @xmath87 moments @xmath34 may be read off from the coefficients of this polynomial .",
    "we emphasize that this procedure makes sense whether or not the series   converges ; expressions such as are simply convenient expressions for the combinatorial relation between different moments and may be understood as formal power series .",
    "consider the case of @xmath0 in four dimensions , where @xmath1 is a massless scalar field and the average is in the time direction only .",
    "the two - point function which appears in the integrals for the moments is now @xmath90 the corresponding dimensionless moments were calculated using maple for @xmath91 , and the resulting moments up to @xmath92 are listed in the first column of table  [ table : moments ] .",
    "our computations were exact and give the @xmath34 as rational numbers .",
    "however , for ease of display , the results have been rounded to five significant figures .",
    "the full set of exact moments is available as supplementary material  @xcite .",
    "as stated earlier , these moments may be used to infer that the probability distribution of the quantity in   is a shifted gamma given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shifted_gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : phi2-parameters ] ) .",
    "only the first three moments are needed for this fit , but the result reproduces the first 65 moments exactly , a spectacular agreement .",
    "next we turn to the case where @xmath93 and calculate several of the moments of the lorentz - smearing of @xmath94 . in this case",
    "we use @xmath95 as before , the moments were computed exactly as rational numbers using maple for @xmath96  @xcite , and the resulting moments up to @xmath92 are listed in the second column of table  [ table : moments ] .",

    "as already mentioned , it is possible that the moment problem is indeterminate and that there are many probability distributions with these moments . here",
    ", we show that no such distribution can have a tail decreasing much more slowly than that studied above .",

    "let @xmath104 be the probability measure of @xmath100 and then compute @xmath105 ( the term @xmath106 is only needed for odd @xmath21 , in fact .",

    "this gives an asymptotic bound on the tail probability @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",
    "this gives an upper bound on the tail probability distribution , which is not much more slowly decaying than that for our fitted tail , for which the tail probability would be decaying like @xmath115 .",
    "the following discussion sketches how information on the lower bound can be obtained ; this could be developed into a rigorous discussion ( and probably sharpened ) with further work .",
    "in fact , we do not seek a strict lower bound on the tail probability , but rather aim to show that it must be very often of the order of the fitted tail or higher .",

    "the supremum mentioned occurs for @xmath143 , and we find @xmath144",

    "it seems likely that this is a substantial underestimate of the measure of @xmath132 , as some of the estimates used in the last part of the argument are rather weak .",
    "thus the broad behavior of the tail of the probability distribution is determined by the moments , even if the exact probability distribution is not uniquely determined . in the applications we give below",

    "thus nucleation of black holes of mass @xmath189 is common , but @xmath188 black holes are very rare .",
    "why do we not notice these @xmath190 g black holes ?",
    "presumably they must appear for a very short time and be surrounded by negative energy which quickly destroys them .",
    "recently , the `` boltzmann brain '' problem has become the subject of increasing interest in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "this is the possibility that conscious entities , which may or may not resemble biological brains , might spontaneously nucleate and exist for a finite time .",

    "although the probability per unit volume for the nucleation of a boltzmann brain may seem exceedingly low , the available volume could make them more numerous than other observers .",
    "note that in this case , the energy density has been averaged over a spacetime region which is much larger in the time direction than in the spatial directions , @xmath204 .",
    "hence the probability distribution for the energy density averaged in time alone should be a good approximation here .",

    "if the probability distribution is continuous , with probability density function @xmath206 on @xmath101 , and @xmath207 then the stieltjes problem is indeterminate for the moments of @xmath208 ( assuming they all exist , and that @xmath209 for convenience ) ; there is more than one probability distribution supported in @xmath101 with the same moments .",
    "this is a theorem of krein ( modified slightly to our setting ) see , e.g. , theorem  5.1 in ref .",
    "in particular , this would show that any distribution whose tail was exactly equal to @xmath210 for large enough @xmath30 had indeterminate moments in the above sense . on the other hand , if @xmath206 were to oscillate around @xmath211 , but sometimes taking much smaller values than @xmath212 , then the logarithm will take large negative values ; such behavior could lead the integral to diverge and allow the moment problem to be determinate .    to illustrate how delicate the uniqueness issue can be",
    ", we note that the probability distribution @xmath213 , has moments @xmath214 , that are indeterminate in the stieltjes sense on @xmath142 by krein s theorem",
    ". however , mild modifications of these moments yield determinate problems . for example , by cor .  4.21 in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a constant @xmath12 so that the set of moments @xmath215 , @xmath216 is a _ determinate _ problem , corresponding to a purely discrete probability distribution .",
    "overall , we are not able to resolve the question of determinacy , although on balance our expectation is that the problem is indeed indeterminate . certainly we have not been able to find any positive evidence to suggest that the moments are determinate .",
    "nonetheless , certain features of the probability distribution can be ascertained .",
    "we have shown in appendix  a that our moments grow as a power times @xmath217 .",
    "this rate of growth seems to be just what is needed to produce distributions with tails falling as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pb2 ] ) , that is , proportional to @xmath218 .",
    "we have argued that any probability distribution arising from our moments will have a broadly similar tail .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is all that is needed for many applications of our distributions , such as those discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : apps ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that the conclusion that the probability distribution has a lower bound is independent of any concerns about uniqueness , because this follows from existing quantum inequality bounds .",
    "our actual estimates of the lower bounds , given in sect .",
    "[ sec : estimates ] , are not strictly independent of the uniqueness issue , but only use a finite number of the moments .",
    "thus the numerical answers obtained only depend upon the values of these moments .      in this paper we have explored possible probability distributions for averaged quadratic operators in the four - dimensional minkowski vacuum state .",
    "we use averaging with a lorentzian function of time , and investigate the distributions for @xmath94 , where @xmath1 is a massless scalar field , for @xmath98 , the associated scalar field energy density , for @xmath97 , the squared electric field , and for @xmath99 . in all cases , we infer that the distributions have some features in common with our previous results  @xcite for a conformal field in two dimensions and for @xmath0 in four dimensions . specifically , there is a lower bound on the distribution , which coincides with the optimal quantum inequality bound on the associated expectation value in an arbitrary quantum state . furthermore , there is no upper bound on the distributions , so arbitrarily large positive quantum fluctuations are possible .",
    "we have outlined a procedure that , in principle , allows the calculation of an arbitrary number of moments of a given distribution . in practice , this procedure can be carried at least as far as the @xmath219 moment , which is sufficient to allow reasonable numerical estimates of both the lower bounds , and of the asymptotic tail for large argument .",
    "these are not guaranteed to be unique , but as was argued in the previous subsection , they may be useful .    if we accept the forms of the tails which we find , then several physically interesting applications follow , including the nucleation rates for black holes and boltzmann brains .",
    "it should also be possible to apply these results to the study of the small scale structure of four dimensional spacetime , along the lines studied in two dimensions in ref .",
    "it may also be possible to learn more about the non - gaussian density and gravity wave perturbations in inflationary cosmology , which were studied in refs .",
    "another implication of our form for the tail is that vacuum fluctuations will dominate thermal fluctuations at high energies .",
    "the boltzmann distribution falls exponentially with energy , but vacuum energy density fluctuations fall more slowly and hence eventually dominate .",
    "there is clearly room for further work on the topic of this paper .",
    "one obvious problem is to determine whether or not the moment problems we have studied are determinate : if so , one would like to know the detailed form of the corresponding probability distributions ; if not , one would like to know how much information may be extracted from the moments , nonetheless , along the lines of the arguments in sect .",
    "[ sect : cdf ] .",
    "in addition , our results have now trapped the sharp quantum inequality bounds for various operators between the lower bounds given by the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite and the bounds obtained in sect .",
    "[ sec : estimates ] , which are an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "if the moment problem is determinate , the latter bounds will coincide with the sharp bound ; otherwise it would be interesting to determine what the sharp bound actually is . recall that here we deal only with lorentzian sampling and only in the time direction",
    ". it will also be of interest to investigate more general sampling functions , and the effects of sampling in space as well as time .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation under grants phy-0855360 and phy-0968805 .",
    "we describe how the moments of smeared wick squares may be computed for a general derivative @xmath44 of the massless field @xmath1 in four dimensions , writing @xmath208 for one more than twice the number of derivatives , so @xmath220 for @xmath29 and @xmath221 for @xmath205 .",
    "thus the two - point function for @xmath44 , restricted to the time axis , is given by @xmath222 with smearing along the time axis against smearing function @xmath46 , the rules for computing the contribution to the @xmath21th connected moment of a given connected graph on @xmath21 vertices may be stated in fourier space as follows .",
    "for each line , the form of the two - point function entails that there is a momentum integral over the positive half - line and a factor of the @xmath208th power of the momentum ; for each vertex there is a factor of @xmath223 if the vertex is the source of the lines carrying momenta @xmath224 and @xmath225 , a factor of @xmath226 if the vertex is the source ( resp . , target ) of the line carrying momentum @xmath224 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath225 ) , or a factor of @xmath227 if the vertex is the target of the lines carrying momenta @xmath224 and @xmath225 ; there is an overall factor of @xmath228 and a combinatorial factor that is @xmath81 for @xmath229 and @xmath61 for @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath230 is the fourier transform , defined with the convention @xmath231 an important point is that if , as for the lorentzian , @xmath230 is real and positive , then every graph contributes positively to the moment .",
    "thus any individual graph on @xmath21-vertices gives a lower bound on the @xmath21th connected moment .",
    "if one wishes to compute the dimensionless moments , defined in the text so that @xmath232 , the overall factor @xmath233 is replaced by @xmath234 for @xmath229 ( or @xmath235 in the case @xmath60 ) .    in the particular case of the lorentzian  , we have @xmath236 , and a simplification of the computation rules : a vertex met by lines carrying momenta @xmath224 and @xmath225 contributes @xmath237 if it is a target for one and a source for the other , or @xmath238 otherwise .",
    "this means that the overall integral over @xmath239 factorizes at each vertex that is either a double source or a double target .",
    "recall that the graphs involved are drawn on @xmath21 vertices @xmath54 , placed in increasing order from left to right .",
    "each vertex is met by two distinct lines , and each line is directed to the right . in particular , @xmath82 is the source of both lines connected to it .",
    "we may represent such a graph by a permutation @xmath240 of the set @xmath241 of integers , subject to the conditions that @xmath242 and @xmath243 . to reconstruct a graph from a permutation , draw lines from @xmath244 to @xmath245 , from @xmath245 to @xmath246 , and so on , finishing with an line from @xmath247 to @xmath82 .",
    "[ for this reason , it is convenient to adopt a convention that @xmath248 . ]",
    "then place rightwards - pointing arrows on each line . on the other hand , to encode a graph as a permutation , start at @xmath82 and follow the shorter of the two lines to the vertex it meets [ i.e. , of the two vertices joined to @xmath82 , choose the one with the smaller label ] , and continue along the other line meeting that vertex .",
    "at each subsequent vertex , continue along the line not previously traversed , eventually returning to @xmath82 . then @xmath249 is defined to be the @xmath250th vertex met on this trip .",
    "a _ run _ of @xmath240 is a set of consecutive integers in @xmath251 , say @xmath252 , such that @xmath253 is a monotone sequence , either ascending or descending , and so that no superset of consecutive integers has the same property .",
    "the length of the run is defined to be @xmath254 .",
    "every permutation used to label our graphs corresponds to an even number of runs , alternating between ascending and descending , whose lengths sum to @xmath21 , and with consecutive runs sharing a common endpoint .",
    "for example , the permutation @xmath255 ( i.e. , @xmath242 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , ... ) has runs @xmath258 ; @xmath259 ; @xmath260 and @xmath261 , of lengths @xmath262 ; representing each run by its image under the permutation , these runs are more transparently written as @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 .    the contribution to the @xmath21th connected moment arising from the graph corresponding to any given permutation is easily seen to factorize into terms corresponding to the runs , whose values depend only on the length of the run : in our example , the graph contributes @xmath267 to the dimensionless connected moment @xmath268 , where the @xmath269 correspond to the special case @xmath270 of the family of integrals @xmath271 [ here , @xmath272 are dimensionless versions of the momenta previously used . ]",
    "these considerations reduce the computation of the @xmath21th connected moment to two problems : the computation of the @xmath269 and the enumeration of all permutations in the class considered with a given run structure . to address the first of these , we note the easily proved identity @xmath273 of which the standard integral @xmath274 is the @xmath275 special case , and which entails the recurrence relation @xmath276 as @xmath277 , it follows that @xmath278 is given by @xmath279 for any integers @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "although we have not found a closed form expression for the @xmath282 , the above expressions allow for them to be computed efficiently .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the problem of enumerating permutations of the class we study in terms of their run structure does not appear to have been solved in the literature on enumerative combinatorics , although related problems have been studied for over a century .",
    "a closed form answer seems out of reach , but generating function techniques allow one to build up a solution for each @xmath21 in a recursive way .",
    "the details will be reported elsewhere  @xcite , but the overall result is the following : for each @xmath21 , let @xmath283 be a polynomial in the variables @xmath284 , with @xmath285 and subject to the recurrence relation @xmath286 then , for @xmath229 , the coefficient of @xmath287 in @xmath283 is precisely the number of permutations @xmath240 of @xmath241 with @xmath288 runs of length @xmath191 ( @xmath289 ) , subject to the side conditions @xmath242 , @xmath243 . in the case",
    "@xmath60 , we find half of the number of such permutations .",
    "the generating function is extremely convenient , because it already incorporates the sum over all possible connected graphs . putting this together with the other considerations above , the @xmath21th dimensionless connected moment",
    "is given by @xmath290 , for any @xmath291 , where the variables @xmath269 are given the values defined above by ( recalling that @xmath270 ) .",
    "for example , we find the explicit formulae : @xmath292 which can be used to provide the first few connected moments for @xmath29 in the case @xmath220 or @xmath205 in the case @xmath221 .",
    "one may check that the coefficients inside each parenthesis sum to @xmath293 , the total number of connected graphs involved in the @xmath21th moment .",
    "in this appendix we give asymptotic estimates for the @xmath21th moments of the lorentzian smearing of the wick square of the @xmath294th derivative of @xmath1 as @xmath21 becomes large .",
    "we rigorously establish a lower bound and also give an upper bound , for which our reasoning is not completely rigorous , but which appears to be satisfied on the grounds of numerical evidence .",
    "the basic observation is that the dominant contribution to @xmath77 [ and hence the full dimensionless moment @xmath34 ] is @xmath296 ; this is certainly a lower bound ( as all terms are positive ) and numerical evidence suggests that it gives the correct answer modulo a fractional error of order @xmath297 .",
    "thus lower bounds on the @xmath298 will give rigorous lower bounds on @xmath77 , while upper bounds give an upper bound on the @xmath77 that seems reasonably secure , albeit not fully rigorous . in terms of permutations and graphs ,",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the identity permutation , and thus the graph on @xmath21 vertices that has lines from @xmath299 to @xmath300 for each @xmath301 and an line from @xmath82 to @xmath302 .",
    "the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] represent the case @xmath60 and @xmath67 .",
    "we begin with the lower bound , which is @xmath303 where @xmath304 in which the product over @xmath250 is taken to be equal to unity in the case @xmath183 .",
    "the bound   is proved by induction , noting that the it is true ( indeed , an equality ) for @xmath183 .",
    "supposing that it holds for some @xmath280 , we use the recurrence relation eq .   to show that @xmath305 where",
    ", in the first line , we have used the fact that the constants @xmath306 are clearly monotone decreasing in @xmath307 for each fixed @xmath21 , and the identity ( 0.151.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath308 the second line is an elementary algebraic manipulation .",
    "a further algebraic manipulation shows that @xmath309 which allows us to conclude that the bound on @xmath282 holds for all @xmath21 by induction . noting that @xmath310 we obtain a lower bound on @xmath311 as @xmath312    in a similar way",
    ", we find an upper bound @xmath313 where @xmath314 and the product on @xmath250 is again regarded as a factor of unity in the case @xmath183 . from this expression , it is clear that the @xmath315 are monotone increasing in @xmath307 for each fixed @xmath21 .",
    "the double product can be also be written as a ratio of products of @xmath121-functions and other simple functions ; in the case @xmath316 there is a particularly simple expression @xmath317 as before , we prove by induction , noting that it holds with equality in the case @xmath183 . supposing that it is true for some @xmath280 , the recurrence relation eq .",
    "gives @xmath318 over the summation range , we have @xmath319 , so @xmath320 where we have changed summation variable to @xmath321 and extended the summation range in the second step . using eq .  , this gives @xmath322 using the fact that @xmath323 !",

    "then one may check that the lower bound in   is , asymptotically , @xmath328 while a similar calculation at the upper bound gives @xmath329 so the ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound grows as @xmath330 as @xmath331 , with @xmath332 which in the case @xmath221 gives @xmath333 , @xmath334 .",
    "so we have a reasonable control over the leading order contribution .",
    "as mentioned above , it is certain that the dimensionless moment @xmath34 obeys @xmath335 , and numerical evidence suggests that @xmath336 at least in the case @xmath221 ( we believe that this is true for all @xmath337 and could be proved with more effort ) .",
    "on that basis , we have @xmath338 in the @xmath221 case , for @xmath331 .",
