    "the integral observatory @xcite with the ibis / isgri telescope @xcite and the swift observatory @xcite with the burst alert telescope ( bat , @xcite ) are performing a continuous monitoring of the sky in the hard x - ray energy band offering a long - term database for the activity of the x - ray sources and a large number of new detections of transient or very faint accreting sources .",
    "most of the recently discovered high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are characterized by high local absorption ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) that prevented their detection by past soft x - ray monitoring .",
    "the bat telescope is complementary to ibis / isgri for the study of the temporal behavior of these sources as it covers a fraction between 50% and 80% of the sky every day thanks to is large field of view ( 1.4 steradian half coded ) and to its pointing strategy . the long ( since 2004 december 15 ) and continuous monitoring has allowed to investigate the intrinsic emission variability and to search for the presence of long periodicities , unveiling the binary nature of many integral sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .            in this letter",
    "we analyze the soft and hard x - ray data collected by swift on igr  j182191347 .",
    "the source was discovered by integral @xcite and it was associated with xmmsl1 j182155.0134719 because of a spatial coincidence .",
    "a 2mass object ( 2mass 182154631347232 ) found within the xmm counterpart position error box was initially identified as the infrared counterpart of the igr source @xcite .",
    "igr  j182191347 was also detected by bat @xcite at the end of january 2012 , with an intensity rising of a factor of 10 in 7 days : the average 17 - 60 kev flux was @xmath7 erg @xmath6 s@xmath8 , more than 25 times the flux measured by integral @xcite .",
    "the bat detection triggered a swift - xrt @xcite follow up observing campaign allowing to obtain a refined position with a localization accuracy of 1.7  , confirming the soft x - ray counterpart xmmsl1 j182155.0134719 and rejecting the infrared counterpart candidate 2mass 182154631347232 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-xrt observations also revealed strong evidence for variability with an intensity variation at least of a factor of 50 . a follow - up observation with",

    "the chandra source position was cross correlated with the ukidss sky survey data allowing to identify an infrared source at ra@xmath10 = 18h 21 m 54.766s , dec@xmath10 = -13@xmath11 47 26.77  , at a distance of @xmath12 0.8  , with magnitudes j=18.00 , h=16.01 , and k=14.44 , as the likely counterpart . an accurate study of the profile of the image of this source showed , however , that it is likely the superposition of two sources that can not be separated because of the spatial resolution of the infrared data",
    ".    broad band ( 0.5100 kev ) spectral analysis combining @xmath9-xrt and integral / ibis data was modeled with an absorbed power law ( n@xmath13   @xmath14 , photon index @xmath121 and an exponential cutoff at @xmath126 kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "the information derived from the broad band spectrum analysis and the strong variability suggested that igr  j182191347 belongs to the class of the hmxbs .",

    "section 2 describes the data reduction .",
    "section 3 reports on the timing analysis . in section 4",
    "we describe the spectral analysis and in section 5 we briefly discuss our results .",
    "the bat survey data ( 15150 kev ) of the first 88 months of the @xmath9   mission ( 2004 december  2012 march ) were retrieved from the heasarc public archive and processed with a software @xcite dedicated to the analysis of data of coded mask telescopes .",
    "the code performs screening , mosaicking and source detection and produces scientific products of any detected source .",
    "igr  j182191347 was detected in the 15150 kev at a significance of 12.0 standard deviations , with a maximum of significance ( 12.7 standard deviations ) in the 1545 kev energy band .",
    "figure  [ map ] ( left ) shows the 1545 kev significance sky map ( exposure time of 28.1 ms ) centered in the direction of igr  j182191347 .",
    "we extracted the background subtracted spectrum of the source averaged over the entire survey and the light curve in the 1545 kev energy range with the maximum available time resolution ( @xmath15 s ) .",
    "the time tag of each bin of the light curve was corrected to the solar system barycentre ( ssb ) using the jpl de-200 ephemeris @xcite and the task earth2sun .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath9-xrt observed the field of igr  j182191347 on 2010 march 5 in photon counting ( pc ) mode without detecting any source ( obs # 0 in table  [ log ] ) .",
    "two years later ( 2012 february 15 ) , following the detection of the source as a transient by bat , a one month target of opportunity campaign was activated .",
    "the source was observed in pc mode in the first observation ( obs # 1 in table  [ log ] ) and in windowed timing ( wt ) mode @xcite in the following observations ( obs # 2 to 11 in table  [ log ] ) .",
    "the xrt data were processed with standard procedures ( xrtpipeline v.0.12.4 ) , filtering and screening criteria , using ftools in the heasoft package ( v 6.8 ) .",
    "we adopted standard grade filtering 0 - 12 and 0 - 2 for pc and wt data , respectively .",
    "igr  j182191347 was detected only in 5 out of 11 observations .",
    "table 1 reports the details on the @xmath9-xrt observations and the relevant count rate .",
    "figure  [ map ] ( right ) shows the 0.210 kev xrt image from obsid 00032285001 where a source consistent in position to the likely soft x - ray counterpart xmmsl1 j182155.0134719 is detected with a significance of @xmath16 standard deviations .",
    "no other sources are detected inside the bat error box .",
    "the source events for data collected in pc mode ( obs # 1 ) were extracted from a circular region of 20 pixel radius ( 1 pixel = 2.36  ) centered on the source position as determined with xrtcentroid while , for data collected in wt mode , events were extracted only from obs . 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 ( see table 1 ) by selecting a 20 pixel wide portion of the wt strip centered on the source position .",
    "the background for spectral analysis was extracted from an annular region centered on the source with radii of 70 and 130 pixels for the observation in pc mode and from two strip regions ( symmetrical with respect to the source position ) sufficiently offset ( @xmath17 arcminutes ) from the source to avoid any contamination from its psf wings in wt mode .",
    "we used the official bat spectral redistribution matrix and the xrt spectral redistribution matrix v013 .",
    "xrt ancillary response files were generated with xrtmkarf spectral fits were performed using xspec v.12 .",
    "the source and background spectra of the observations in wt mode were combined to obtain a single spectrum , and the ancillary files were combined using addarf weighting them by the exposure times of the relevant spectra .",
    "finally , spectra were rebinned with a minimum of 20 counts per energy channel , in order to allow the use of the @xmath18 statistics .",
    "we analyzed the long term bat light curve to search for periodic intensity modulation using the epoch folding method @xcite .",
    "the 1545 kev bat light curve was folded with different trial periods p from 0.5d to 500d with a step of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of trial profile phase bins and @xmath21211.7 ms is the data time span . to build profiles for each trial period",
    "we applied a weighing procedure ( e.g. @xcite ) suitable for background dominated data with a large span of count rate errors .",
    "figure  [ period]a shows the periodogram , where several features emerge .",
    "the highest one has a @xmath18 value of @xmath22 and corresponds to a period of p@xmath1 d. from fitting the peak profile with a gaussian function , we derived a p@xmath2 centroid and a standard deviation of 72.44 d and 0.3 d , respectively .",
    "we see also other evident features at periods multiples of p@xmath2 ( p@xmath23 , p@xmath24 , p@xmath25 , p@xmath26 , p@xmath27 in fig  [ period]a ) and at the sub - multiple @xmath28 .",
    "the intensity profile ( fig  [ period]b ) folded at p@xmath2 with t@xmath29=54619.3125 shows a peak that covers 30% of the period , over a flat level consistent with zero . to evaluate the phase position of the peak centroid we have built a pulse profile folding bat data with p@xmath2 , @xmath30 phase bins and fit the peak with a gaussian model : the centroid is at phase @xmath31 corresponding to mjd @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of the feature at @xmath28 is a direct consequence of the sharp and narrow peak shown in figure  [ period]b : folding with a period equal to p@xmath33 this peak will be added coherently to the profile every two cycles , producing a feature in the periodogram with an intensity significantly lower with respect to the main feature .    as a consequence of the source variability and of the presence of a periodic signal , the average @xmath18 in the periodogram is far from the average value expected for white noise @xmath34 and the @xmath18 statistics can not be applied .",
    "the significance of the observed feature shall be evaluated with respect to the average level of the periodogram noise .",
    "for this reason , we fitted the periodogram with a second order polynomial and subtracted the best fit ( @xmath35 ) to the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the @xmath36 distribution has a value of @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore have built the histogram of the @xmath39 distribution ( figure  [ period]c ) extracting the values only from 22 to 122  d ( where the noise level is quite consistent with the noise level at @xmath38 ) and excluding the interval around @xmath38 and around @xmath28 .",
    "we fit the tail ( @xmath40 ) of this distribution with an exponential function .",
    "the resulting best fit model is plotted in figure  [ period]c .",
    "we have evaluated the area under the histogram dividing it into two parts : from its left boundary up to @xmath41 we have summed the contribution of each single bin ; beyond @xmath41 up to infinity we have integrated the best fit exponential model .",
    "therefore , we evaluated the integral of the best - fit exponential function beyond 304 and normalized it to the total area of the histogram . the result ( @xmath42 )",
    "is the probability of chance occurrence of a @xmath39 equal to or larger than 304 or a @xmath18 equal to or larger than 358 and it corresponds to a significance for the detected feature of @xmath43 standard deviations in gaussian statistics .",
    "figure  [ period]d shows the 1545 kev light curve of igr  j18219 - 1347 with a bin time of p@xmath44 . to visually show the periodicity in the bat light curve , we over - plotted vertical shaded bars spaced by p@xmath2 and in phase with the peak of the bat folded profile ( fig .  [ period]b ) .",
    "table  [ log ] reports the phase corresponding to each xrt observation relevant to the bat light curve profile in figure  [ period]b .",
    "we observe that the pointing with the highest count rate corresponds to the phase closest to the peak , while upper limits correspond to orbital phases farther from the peak .",
    "the statistics of the source in the xrt dataset both in pc and in wt mode is too low to allow for timing analysis finalized to the search for a pulsation .",
    "broad band spectral analysis was performed using the xrt data relevant to the observations with the source detected above 2 standard deviations ( obs .  1 in pc mode and obs .  2 , 3 , 5 and 6 in wt mode that were summed into a single spectrum because the statistics of each single wt dataset is too low to build a significant spectrum ; see table  [ log ] and sect .  2 ) and",
    "the bat hard x - ray spectrum averaged over the 88 months of monitoring , selecting only intervals corresponding to the phase of the peak .",
    "we assumed no significant spectral variability among the xrt observations and during the bat monitoring .",
    "a preliminary analysis was made to verify that this assumption was indeed valid .",
    "the xrt spectra in pc mode and wt mode were fitted simultaneously with an absorbed power - law with the absorption hydrogen column and the photon index parameters forced to have the same value in both datasets .",
    "the best fit residuals showed the same trend for both datasets , with a best fit photon index equal to @xmath45 and absorbing column density equal to @xmath46 .",
    "six bat spectra were produced to verify the assumption of non - variability both during the 88-month monitoring ( dividing it into four 22-month long intervals ) and/or during different phase intervals of figure  [ period]b ( selecting the two spectra corresponding to phase intervals 0.43750.625 and 0.6251.375 ) .",
    "these spectra were fitted with a power law model and , as above , the photon index was constrained to have the same value for all the spectra without any constraint for the normalization parameters .",
    "the best fit residuals show the same trend for all the datasets , with best fit photon index @xmath47 .    therefore , assuming no significant spectral variability during the bat monitoring and between the xrt spectra we performed a broad band spectral analysis coupling the soft x - ray spectra with the bat spectrum selected in phase with the peak in the folded profile ( phase intervals 0.4375 to 0.625 in figure  [ period]b ) introducing in the model a multiplicative factor to take into account both an intercalibration factor between the two telescopes and the different average flux level among the three datasets .",
    "an absorbed power law model gave an unacceptable @xmath18 of 89.21 ( 52 d.o.f . ) .",
    "this was expected because of the difference in photon index found in the analysis performed separately for the xrt and bat datasets .",
    "the broad - band spectrum resulted indeed well fitted ( @xmath18=61.7 ( 51 d.o.f . ) adding to the power law a high energy exponential cutoff ( phabs*cutoffpl model ) .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows the combined xrt and bat energy distribution with best fit model ( top panel ) and residuals in units of standard deviations ( bottom panel ) .",
    "table  [ fit ] reports the best fit parameters ( quoted errors are given at 90% confidence level ) .",
    "we have presented the results obtained from the analysis of the data collected by _ swift _ on igr  j18219 - 1347 .",
    "the first 88 months of bat survey data show a strong emission variability in the hard x - ray energies with the source going from quiescent to high emission states .",
    "the timing analysis performed on the bat data unveils a periodic modulation of p@xmath2=72.44 days that we interpret as the orbital period of binary system .",
    "the profile obtained folding the bat light curve at p@xmath2 shows a flat plateau consistent with the source being in a quiescent state , and a narrow peak lasting only 30% of the orbital period . the brightness enhancement on 2012 feb . 6",
    "( mjd 55963 ) , observed by bat and reported by @xcite , correspond to phase 0.54 , fully consistent with the phase of the peak in the folded light curve .",
    "the one - month xrt observing campaign that followed this detection shows that the soft x - ray emission is in agreement with the hard x - ray modulation , with the source * strongly * detected only in the observations close to the bat folded light curve peak * ( obs 1 to 3 ) * and with no or marginal detections ( obs 5 and 6 ) in the observations corresponding to the plateau .",
    "* the non - detection in obs 4 is * due to a higher background level ( a factor of 2 higher than in obs 5 and 6 ) .    the long orbital period and the evidence that the source emits only during a small fraction of the orbit suggests that the high mass companion of igr  j18219 - 1347 is a be star .",
    "be / x - ray binaries are indeed the most numerous class of hmxb and are characterized by wide orbits with moderate eccentricities , as opposite to supergiant x - ray binaries that show circular orbits with periodicities shorter than @xmath48 days ( e.g. @xcite ) . in a be / x - ray binary system the accretion onto the neutron star is driven by mass capture from an equatorial disk around the equatorial plane of the be star @xcite .",
    "this is favored at the periastron passage and causes the so - called type - i outbursts , while for most of the orbit a large orbital distance prevents the accretion , keeping the source in a quiescent state .",
    "this is consistent with the overall behaviour observed in the bat light curve of igr  j18219 - 1347 ( fig .",
    "[ period]d ) , with the source emission characterized by periodical emission peaks .",
    "as observed for be / xray binary systems @xcite , the intensity of these peaks show a large variability and is related to the amount of disk material captured for accretion during the periastron passage .",
    "@xcite showed that in be / x - ray binaries the orbital period tends to be correlated with the spin period .",
    "if igr  j18219 - 1347 is indeed a member of this class , we can expect a spin period longer than 10 s.    the broad - band ( 0.2150 kev ) spectrum of igr  j182191347 is well modeled with a flat absorbed power law with a high energy exponential cutoff at @xmath4 kev .",
    "the column density is @xmath49 , which is a factor of @xmath50 larger than the galactic value in the direction of the source ( @xmath51 @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests an additional intrinsic absorption in the environment of the binary system .",
