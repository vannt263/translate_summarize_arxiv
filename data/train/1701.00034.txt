    "all the negative cubes in @xmath657 that touch @xmath369 do so through an edge in @xmath373 since they will be at distance @xmath4 from the children structures @xmath658 . since the perturbation @xmath2 takes a strictly positive value ( approx .",
    "@xmath582 ) along any edge in @xmath373 , the negative cubes in @xmath657 will be separated from those in in @xmath659 .",
    "simultaneously , for each @xmath129 , all the cubes in @xmath660 are glued to each other since they are negative cubes that touch @xmath661 and @xmath661 is a connected set on which the perturbation @xmath2 takes a strictly negative value ( approx .",

    "this edge , which joins a negative cube in @xmath662 and a negative cube in @xmath663 has its boundary inside @xmath661 . since @xmath2 is strictly positive ( approx .",
    "@xmath582 ) on @xmath661 , we know that the parts of the two cubes that are close to the boundary will be disconnected . however , since the perturbation was built so that @xmath2 is strictly negative ( approx .",
    "@xmath430 ) at the midpoint of the edge , both negative cubes are glued to each other .",
    "in fact , one can build a curve @xmath664 contained inside the nodal domain that joins @xmath665 with @xmath666 .",
    "it then follows that all the cubes in @xmath667 are glued to each other after the perturbation is performed and they will form the nodal domain @xmath507 of @xmath423 containing @xmath668",
    ". one can carry the same stability arguments we presented in section [ local ] to obtain that at a local level there are no unexpected new nodal domains .",
    "for this to hold , as in the @xmath316 case , the argument hinges on the fact that in the places where both @xmath247 and @xmath2 vanish , the gradient of @xmath2 is not zero ( as explained at the end of each rule ) .",
    "finally , rule b is there to ensure that the topology of each nodal domain is controlled in the sense that when the cubes in @xmath656 glue to each other they do so without creating unexpected handles .",
    "indeed , the cubes in @xmath656 can be retracted to the set @xmath669 where @xmath670 and @xmath671 are the children of @xmath672 .",
    "the argument we just sketched also shows that the nodal domains @xmath507 with @xmath356 are nested as prescribed by the tree @xmath47 .",
