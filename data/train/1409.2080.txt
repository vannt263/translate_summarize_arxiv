    "the first step to build a connectome is to select a parcellation of the brain , with @xmath4 parcels . in this work , we used functional brain parcellations , aimed at defining groups of brain regions with homogeneous time series .",
    "a number of algorithms have been proposed with additional spatial constraints , to ensure that the resulting parcels are spatially connected @xcite . however , from a pure functional viewpoint , the spatial constraint seems somewhat arbitrary , as functional units in the brain at low resolution encompass distributed networks of brain regions with homotopic regions often being part of a single parcel @xcite .",
    "some works have thus used distributed parcels as the spatial units to measure functional brain connectivity , e.g. @xcite . to generate the functional parcelations , we relied on a recent method called `` bootstrap analysis of stable clusters '' ( basc ) , which can identify consistent functional parcels for a group of subjects @xcite , using a hierarchical cluster with ward s criterion both at the individual and the group levels .",
    "the functional parcels can be generated at any arbitrary scale ( within the range of the fmri resolution ) , and we considered only parcels generated at the group level , which were non - overlapping and not necessarily spatially contiguous .",

    "there are exactly @xmath12 distinct elements in an individual connectome @xmath13 .",
    "this connectome can be stored as a @xmath14 vector , where the brain connections have been ordered arbitrarily along one dimension .",
    "when functional data is available on @xmath15 subjects , the group of connectomes is then assembled into a @xmath16 array @xmath17 , where @xmath18 each code for one subject and @xmath19 each code for one connection . a general linear model ( glm )",

    "the idea of the fdr is not to strictly control the probability to observe at least one false positive ( a quantity know as family - wise error , fwe ) , but rather to control , on average , the proportion of false positive amongst the findings . note that controlling for the fdr is not necessarily a more liberal attitude than controlling for the fwe : if the global null hypothesis is verified , i.e. all discoveries are false positive , then the fdr is exactly the fwe . in the presence of true discoveries",
    ", however , the fdr procedure tolerates in general more noise than a fwe approach .",
    "the actual number of false discoveries will depend on the amount of signal ( true positive ) present in the data , and is therefore a context - dependent question .",
    "the bh procedure is a popular technique to control the fdr , which was designed for independent tests .",
    "the bh still has been shown to have a satisfactory behaviour even in the presence of positive correlation between the tests @xmath34 @xcite . on simulations ,",
    "the specificity of the fdr - bh algorithm was assessed in the presence of a realistic amount of correlation between tests , as would be found in a mspc analysis of fmri data .          to explore the association of connectomes and a trait of interest at multiple scales , some",
    "multiscale brain parcellations first need to be generated , for which we employed the basc method @xcite .",
    "a glm was then estimated with fdr control at each scale independently ( figure [ fig_connectome_multiscale ] ) .",
    "to choose the scales of analysis , a comprehensive strategy would consist of a regular grid , e.g. from @xmath40 to @xmath41 brain parcels , with a step of @xmath40 .",
    "the glm results at such scales may however be highly redundant , as some parcels may be found identically at different scales , if those are close . to systematically examine the results of the glm analysis",
    "at all selected scales , a better strategy would be to select a limited number of non - redundant scales that span a given range ( e.g. @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) .",
    "for this purpose , we used the multiscale stepwise selection ( msteps ) algorithm recently proposed by @xcite to select scales that provide an accurate summary of the stable features of brain clusters observed at all possible scales . both strategies ( comprehensive grid of scales and sparse subset )",
    "were examined in this work , both on simulations and real data .",
    "testing glm on connectomes at multiple scales introduces a new level of multiple comparisons , this time across scales rather than across connections .",
    "in addition to the fdr within scale , one now needs to consider the fdr across scales , i.e. for all tests combined across scales .",
    "for example , if two scales were used , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , there would be @xmath44 tests at each scale ( i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . if there were @xmath40 discoveries at scale @xmath40 , @xmath47 of which was a false positive , and @xmath48 discoveries at scale @xmath49 , @xmath40 of which were false positive , the ratio of false discoveries for this simulation would be @xmath50 within scale 10 , and @xmath51 within scale @xmath49",
    ". the ratio of false discoveries across scales would be @xmath52 .",
    "the fdr within - scale and between - scale would be the average of these false discovery proportions over many replications of such experiments .",
    "a straightforward way to control the fdr across scales would be to apply the fdr - bh procedure to the whole set of tests , pooled across scales . for a regular grid of scales ranging from 10 to 300 , with a step of 10 ,",
    "the largest numbers of tests within scale is @xmath53 .",
    "the total number of tests is in that case @xmath54 , an order of magnitude larger . because the fdr - bh relies on a bonferroni estimation of the number of false positives , an fdr procedure in such a high dimension is bound to have low sensitivity , and would be a high price to pay to explore multiple scales of a glm analysis .",
    "however , we can note that in a multiscale analysis , a detection at any scale makes the presence of signal at all the other scales very likely . in the presence of multiple families of tests and a substantial amount of true discoveries , @xcite hypothesized based on simulations that there would be no need to adjust the fdr across families , when the fdr is controlled within family .",
    "the rationale for this hypothesis is that , in the presence of signal , the fdr controls for a proportion , which behaves well when multiple families are combined .",
    "by contrast , the fwe looks at a maximum statistics and gets mechanically inflated when mutliple families are combined .",
    "in the context of a mspc analysis , efron s hypothesis would mean that controlling for the fdr at each scale independently would also guarantee that the fdr would be controlled across scales .",
    "if supported empirically , this hypothesis would justify to examine the results of a glm on connectomes at many scales , without introducing the need for any additional correction of multiple comparisons beyond what is required by a traditional , single - scale analysis .",
    "the multiscale exploration would basically come for free , provided that enough true discoveries were made overall .",
    "our hypothesis is that the control of the overall fdr ( across connections and scales ) can be attained through the sole control of fdr within scale , in the presence of a substantial volume of true discoveries . at a given scale @xmath55",

    "the glm was first applied with a reduced model where the explanatory variable of interest ( as selected through the contrast ) had been removed .",
    "then , a permutation of the residuals was generated as described in @xcite , see [ app_omnibus ] .",

    "was applied to all of the connections and scales .",
    "the detection procedure was applied on each replication of connectomes , under @xmath58 , and the total volume of discoveries was derived .",

    "high scales indeed proved in some cases to be additionnally informative compared to low scales , despite decreased overall detection rate . for instance , the parcel centered on the hippocampus was seen to be more positively connected with the thalamus and caudate nucleus in schizophrenia only when the ventral prefrontal cortex was not part of the parcel ( figure [ fig_eff_maps ] ) . as another exemple , the thalamus showed increased connectivity with a large sensorimotor cortical parcel at scale 25 and above only , when it was not part of the same parcel as the putamen .",
    "furthemore , the thalamus only showed a significant decrease in connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at scale 55 and above , when isolated as a single parcel rather than smoothed out inside the basal ganglia .",
    "we more formally tested the level of correspondence of the effects across scales for the three seeds listed above in the schizo dataset , as well as for seeds matching our a priori in the blind and motor datasets , respectively located in the right primary visual cortex and the left primary motor cortex .",
    "pairwise comparisons between spatial effect maps across scales mostly revealed positive correlation values in all three datasets and for all seeds ( figure [ fig_eff_multiscale ] ) .",
    "correlations for the three seeds investigated in the schizo contrast were as follows : hippocampus ( mean , standard deviation , minimum , maximum = 0.86 , 0.06 , 0.76 , 0.97 ) , anterior cingulate ( 0.41 , 0.39 , -0.20 , 0.93 ) , and thalamus ( 0.78 , 0.09 , 0.64 , 0.94 ) .",
    "high correlations were always observed when comparing high scales ( above scale 55 ) between them .",
    "comparisons between low and high scales remained associated with high correlations values for two out of the three seeds , namely the hippocampus and thalamus .",
    "however , results for the anterior cingulate demonstrated that a low correspondence between low and high scales was possible .",
    "results for the seeds in the blind ( 0.71 , 0.15 , 0.46 , 0.93 ) and motor ( 0.80 , 0.08 , 0.70 , 0.95 ) datasets further supported the general conclusions drawn from the schizo dataset .",
    "this work investigated empirically how the scale impacted the results of a glm analysis on connectomes .",
    "we first assessed the validity of a glm analysis at a single scale .",
    "on the three real datasets , there was no sign of substantial departure from the assumptions of a basic parametric glm .",
    "importantly , the control of the effective fdr within scale on simulations was exact or conservative , including the cambridge `` global null '' experiment where real random subgroups were compared .",
    "our empirical evaluation thus supports the validity of parametric glm analysis of connectomes at a single scale .",
    "we also investigated the specificity of mspc analysis across scales .",
    "in most simulation experiments , the control of the fdr within each scale also implied a tight control of the fdr across scales . under the global null hypothesis ,",
    "the omnibus test precisely controlled the fdr ( or , equivalently , the fwe ) . the omnibus test had little to no impact in scenarios with many true non - null hypothesis , where the fdr across scales was conservatively controlled .",
    "the only simulations where a deviation of the fdr accross scales from nominal levels was observed ( up to 0.09 for a nominal level at 0.05 ) typically resulted in very few findings , especially at high scales ( above 50 ) .",
    "considering that the fdr was always appropriately controlled within scale , our overall conclusion was that , for scales matching those used in our simulation experiments , the inflation of fdr across scales was not a concern as long as the omnibus test was rejected at an appopriate fwe level .",
    "we found some convergent evidence regarding the sensitivity of mspc in our simulation and real data experiments .",
    "first , on simulations with independent tests , the sensitivity decreased sharply with scale , to reach a plateau around scale 50 .",
    "this behaviour appeared to be a consequence of multiple testing in the fdr - bh procedure , as the proportion of true non - null hypothesis and the effect size were strictly maintained at a constant level across scales . in our simulations of dependent tests ,",
    "the scale directly impacted the effect size , as some test clusters matched better the underlying simulated signals than others . in this setting , marked increase ( up to 0.3 ) in sensitivity were observed at certain scales , sometimes quite high ( 200 + ) . in summary , scale - dependent gains in sensitivity were observed and appeared to be simultaneously driven by the match between the test clusters and the underlying signal as well as a mechanic effect of multiple comparisons in the fdr - bh procedure .    on real data , we investigated the discovery rate , i.e. the proportion of significant connections in a connectome .",
    "the same behaviour was observed on the three datasets : highest discovery rate at low scale ( below 50 parcels ) , a plateau from 50 to 100 and a low asymptote above 100 - 200 parcels .",
    "this profile resembled most closely the sensitivity results from simulations with independent tests , and may reflect some intrinsic property of the fdr - bh procedure .",
    "in particular , scales larger than 100 , routinely used with the aal template @xcite , was systematically associated with a much smaller discovery rate than lower scales ( below 50 ) .    in our three experiments ,",
    "we did not identify strong discrepancies between statistical maps generated at different scales , consistent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "this supports the idea that , in many cases a glm analysis at a single scale may be enough to summarize the results of a glm on connectomes .",
    "we observed that effects in some brain parcels were better captured at particular scales .",
    "for example , the difference in thalamic connectivity in the schizo analysis was better seen at scale 55 and above , where the thalami were clustered in one parcel rather than agregated with the putamen and caudate nuclei .",
    "the control of the fdr across scales , which is central to the proposed mspc approach , is only relevant if the results of a glm - connectome analysis are investigated and reported at mutiple scales",
    ". it would not be advisable to run a mspc and then simply report results at the scale with the highest discovery rate .",
    "there would be no guarantee that the fdr would be controlled for a scale that was selected precisely because of a high associated discovery rate , a classic case of circular analysis .",
    "if a single scale were considered in an analysis , the selection of this scale should be either set a priori or selected through mspc on an independent dataset .",
    "however , as we noted previously , our findings on three experiments follow an overall trend that suggests that a single scale below 50 would likely be a better default choice than a template at scale 100 + , such as aal @xcite , in terms of discovery rate .",
    "the effects found on the real datasets were consistent with the existing literature .",
    "first , schizophrenia has been defined as a dysconnectivity syndrome , with aberrant functional interactions between brain regions being a core feature of this mental illness ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as shown here for two out of three parcels , and observed for other unreported brain parcels , widespread decrease in connectivity was observed in patients , with the addition of more localized increases in connectivity .",
    "the prominence of decreases in connectivity in the temporal lobe , hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex , amongst other regions , is well supported by previous studies @xcite .",
    "similarly , increased connectivity between the thalamus and sensorimotor cortex but decreased connectivity with striatal and prefrontal regions has been reported before @xcite .",
    "second , resting - state fmri studies have previously shown that congenital blindness is associated with a reorganization of the interactions between the occiptial cortex and other parts of the brain , in particular the auditory and premotor cortices @xcite , consistent with our findings .",
    "finally , our results are in agreement with the observation that brain activity at rest is modulated by previous intensive motor practice @xcite . even in the absence of a definite ground truth on these real life applications ,",
    "our findings thus had good face validity , and suggested that mspc could be successfully applied to a variety of clinical or experimental conditions .      in this work",
    ", we only controlled for multiple comparisons within each scale using the fdr - bh method , yet several alternative methods have recently been proposed .",
    "@xcite developped a multivariate test that applies on a region - to - brain connectivity map , called multivariate distance matrix regression ( mdmr ) .",
    "this procedure would be used to screen for promising seed - based connectivity maps worthy to explore in a subsequent , independent analysis .",
    "the mdmr approach effectively performs one test per parcel , instead of one test per connection , and thus greatly alleviates the multiple comparison problem .",
    "it does not however provide a control of statistical risk at the level of single connections .",
    "@xcite proposed to use uncorrected threshold on the individual @xmath0-values , but then to identify to which extent the connections that survive the test are interconnected .",
    "this extent measure is compared against what could be observed under a null hypothesis of no association , implemented through permutation testing .",
    "this approch , called network - based statistics ( nbs ) , is the connectome equivalent to the `` cluster - level statistics '' used in spms .",
    "the nbs only offers a loose control of false - positive rate at the level of a single connection , but can be used to reject the possibility that a group of significant findings could be observed by chance in the fwe sense .",
    "both the mdmr and nbs do not offer control of the fdr within scale , and thus can not be used with the mspc approach based on the argument that the fdr control extends across scales .",
    "some of these methods have been compared in a variety of scenarios , e.g. fdr - bh and nbs @xcite , but at a fixed scale . based on the observation of important variations in sensitivity across scales for the fdr - bh , an important avenue of future",
    "work would be to investigate how mdmr , nbs and fdr - bh compare at different scales . of note",
    "is the recent work of @xcite , which combines two scales to peform connectome - wide testing : the low scale is used to screen for promising groups of intra- or inter - parcel connections , and the tests at high scale are re - weighted based on that screening .",
    "the weights can be adjusted to ensure control of the fdr across the connectome .",
    "this alternative approach to multiscale testing is limited to two scales , but may provide additional statistical power compared to mspc as the two scales are analyzed in coombination rather than separately .",
    "although the impact of the number of parcels on cwas sensitivity has been extensively investigated in this work , we only briefly examined how the choice of parcels , and not just their number , could impact sensitivity .",
    "we could , for example , have used random parcellations , like @xcite , a parcellation based on anatomical landmarks such as the aal atlas @xcite , or a functional parcellation with spatial connexity constraints @xcite . from our results on simulations , it seems clear that dramatic differences in statistical power can be achieved at a given spatial scale , if a set of parcels is best adapted to the spatial distribution of an effect .",
    "the work of @xcite suggested that functional brain parcels are more homogeneous than anatomical parcels .",
    "we believe that important improvement in sensitivity could be gained from the optimization of the parcellation scheme , rather than scale , and this represents an important avenue for future research .",
    "following an idea initially explored in @xcite , it may even be possible to relax the constraint of identical parcels across subjects , by matching different individual - specific parcels and use this correspondence to run group - level cwas analysis .",
    "our overall conclusion is that the mspc method is statistically valid ( specific ) and has the potential to identify biologically plausible associations in a variety of experimental conditions .",
    "an analysis at a single scale with less than 50 parcels appears as a reasonable default option , likely to have a sensitivity superior to the common approach using 100 + brain parcels in many settings .",
    "multiscale analysis still have the potential to identify specific effects in small parcels .",
    "the mspc method is available in the niak package @xcite , a free and open - source software that runs in matlab and gnu octave , and we also released a set of multiscale functional brain parcellations .",

    "<S> second , we observed both on simulations and on three real resting - state fmri datasets ( schizophrenia , congenital blindness , motor practice ) that the rate of discovery varied markedly as a function of scales , and was relatively higher for low scales , below 25 . despite the differences in discovery rate , the statistical maps derived at different scales were generally very consistent in the three real datasets . </S>",
    "<S> some seeds still showed effects better observed around 50 , illustrating the potential benefits of multiscale analysis . on real data , the statistical maps agreed well with the existing literature . </S>",
