    "suppose that we have a large population in which only a small number of people are infected by a certain viral disease ( e.g. , one may think of a flu epidemic ) , and that we wish to identify the infected ones . by testing each member of the population individually",
    ", we can expect the cost of the testing procedure to be large .",
    "if we could instead pool a number of samples together and then test the pool collectively , the number of tests required might be reduced .",
    "this is the main conceptual idea behind the classical _ group testing _",
    "problem which was introduced by dorfman @xcite and later found applications in variety of areas .",
    "a few examples of such applications include testing for defective items ( e.g. , defective light bulbs or resistors ) as a part of industrial quality assurance @xcite , dna sequencing @xcite and dna library screening in molecular biology ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) , multiaccess communication @xcite , data compression @xcite , pattern matching @xcite , streaming algorithms @xcite , software testing @xcite , and compressed sensing @xcite . see the books by du and hwang @xcite for a detailed account of the major developments in this area .",
    "symbols represent infected people among healthy people indicated by @xmath6 symbols .",
    "the dashed lines show the individuals contacted by the agents .",
    ", width=328 ]    one way to acquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population whose task is to contact people ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : agents ] ) .",
    "the agents can also be chosen as atm machines , cashiers in supermarkets , among other possibilities . once an agent has made contact with an `` infected '' person ,",
    "there is a _ chance _ that he gets infected , too . by the end of the testing procedure ,",
    "all agents are gathered and tested for the disease . here",
    ", we assume that each agent has a _ log file _ by which one can figure out with whom he has made contact .",
    "one way to implement the log in practice is to use identifiable devices ( for instance , cell phones ) that can exchange unique identifiers when in range .",
    "this way , one can for instance ask an agent to randomly meet a certain number of people in the population and at the end learn which individuals have been met from the data gathered by the device that is carried by the agent . note that , even if an agent contacts an infected person , he will not get infected with certainty . hence , it may well happen that an agent s result is negative ( meaning that he is not infected ) despite a contact with some infected person .",
    "we will assume that when an agent gets infected , the resulting infection will not be contagious , i.e. , an agent never infects other people .",
    "our ultimate goal is to identify the infected persons with the use of a simple recovery algorithm , based on the test results .",
    "we remark that this model is applicable in certain scenarios different from what we described as well .",
    "for instance , in classical group testing , `` dilution '' of a sample might make some of the items present in a pool ineffective .",
    "the effect of dilution can be captured by the notion of contamination in our model .",
    "it is important to notice the difference between this setup and the classical group testing where each contact with an infected person will infect the agent with certainty . in other words , in the classical group testing the decoder fully knows the sampling procedure , whereas in our setup , it has only uncertain knowledge .",
    "hence , in this scenario the decoder has to cope simultaneously with two sources of uncertainty , the unknown group of infected people and the partially unknown ( or stochastic ) sampling procedure .",
    "the collective sampling can be done in adaptive or non - adaptive fashions . in the former",
    ", samplings are carried out one at a time , possibly depending the outcomes of the previous agents . however , in the latter , the sampling strategy is specified and fixed before seeing the the test outcome for any of the agents . in this paper",
    "we only focus on non - adaptive sampling methods , which is more favorable for applications .    the idea behind our setup is mathematically related to compressed sensing @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they differ in a significant way : in compressed sensing , the samples are gathered as linear observations of a sparse real signal and typically tools such as linear programming methods is applied for the reconstruction .",
    "to do so , it is assumed that the decoder knows the measurement matrix a priori . however , this is not the case in our setup .",
    "in other words , using the language of compressed sensing , in our scenario the measurement matrix might be `` noisy '' and is not precisely known to the decoder . as it turns out , by using a sufficient number of agents",
    "this issue can be resolved .",
    "to model the problem , we enumerate the individuals from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and the agents from @xmath7 to @xmath9 . let the non - zero entries of @xmath10 indicate the infected individuals within the population .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath11 is a @xmath2-sparse vector , i.e. , it has at most @xmath2 nonzero entries ( corresponding to the infected population ) .",
    "we refer to the _ support set _ of @xmath11 as the the set which contains positions of the nonzero entries .    as typical in the literature of group testing and compressed sensing , to model the non - adaptive samplings done by the agents , we introduce an @xmath12 boolean _ contact _ matrix @xmath13 where we set @xmath14 to one if and only if the @xmath15th agent contacts the @xmath16th person .",
    "as we see , the matrix @xmath13 only shows which agents contact which persons . in particular it does not indicate whether the agents eventually get affected by the contact",
    "let us assume that at each contact with a sick person an agent gets infected independently with probability @xmath1 ( a fixed parameter that we call the _ contamination probability _ ) .",
    "therefore , the real _ sampling _ matrix @xmath17 can be thought of as a variation of @xmath13 in the following way :    * each non - zero entry of @xmath13 is flipped to @xmath18 independently with probability @xmath19 ; * the resulting matrix @xmath17 is used just as in classical group testing to produce the _ outcome _ vector @xmath20 , @xmath21 where the arithmetic is boolean ( i.e. , multiplication with the logical and and addition with the logical or ) .",
    "the contact matrix @xmath13 , the outcome vector @xmath22 , the number of non - zero entries @xmath2 , and the contamination probability @xmath1 are known to the decoder , whereas the sampling matrix @xmath17 ( under which the collective samples are taken ) and the input vector @xmath11 are unknown .",
    "the task of the decoder is to identify the @xmath2 non - zero entries of @xmath11 based on the known parameters .    as a toy example , consider a population with @xmath23 members where only two of them ( persons @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) are infected .",
    "we send three agents to the population , where the first one contacts persons @xmath26 , the second one contacts persons @xmath27 , and the third one contacts persons @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the contact matrix and the input vector have the following form @xmath29 let us assume that only the second agent gets infected .",
    "this means that the outcome vector is @xmath30 as we can observe , there are many possibilities for the sampling matrix , all of the following form : @xmath31 where the question marks are @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 and @xmath7 with probability @xmath1 .",
    "it is the decoder s task to figure out which combinations make sense based on the outcome vector .",
    "for example , the following matrices and input vectors fit perfectly with @xmath22 : @xmath32    more formally , the goal of our scenario is two - fold :    1 .   designing the contact matrix @xmath13 so that it allows unique reconstruction of _ any _ sparse input @xmath11 from outcome @xmath22 with overwhelming probability ( @xmath0 ) over the randomness of the sampling matrix @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   proposing a recovery algorithm with low computational complexity .    in this work",
    ", we present a probabilistic and a deterministic approach for designing contact matrices suitable for our problem setting along with a simple decoding algorithm for reconstruction .",
    "our approach is to first introduce a rather different setting for the problem that involves no randomness in the way the infection spreads out .",
    "namely , in the new setting an adversary can arbitrarily decide whether a certain contact with an infected individual results in a contamination or not , and the only restriction on the adversary is on the total amount of contaminations being made . in this regard , the relationship between the adversarial variation of the problem and the original ( stochastic ) problem can be thought of akin to the one between the combinatorial problem of designing block codes with large minimum distances as opposed to designing codes for stochastic communication channels .",
    "the reason for introducing the adversarial problem is its combinatorial nature that allows us to use standard tools and techniques already developed in combinatorial group testing .",
    "fortunately it turns out that solving the adversarial variation is sufficient for the original ( stochastic ) problem .",
    "we discuss this relationship and an efficient reconstruction algorithm in section  [ sec : advers ] .",
    "our next task is to design contact matrices suitable for the adversarial ( and thus , stochastic ) problem .",
    "we extend two standard techniques from group testing to our setting .",
    "namely , we give a probabilistic and an explicit construction of the contact matrix in sections [ sec : prob ]  and  [ sec : expl ] , respectively .",
    "the probabilistic construction requires each agent to independently contact any individual with a certain well - chosen probability and ensures that the resulting data gathered at the end of the experiment can be used for correct identification of the infected population with overwhelming probability , provided that the number of agents is sufficiently large .",
    "namely , for contamination probability @xmath1 , we require @xmath33 agents , where @xmath2 is the estimate on the size of the infected population .",
    "the explicit construction , on the other hand , precisely determines which agent should contact which individual , and guarantees correct identification with certainty in the adversarial setting and with overwhelming probability ( over the randomness of the contaminations ) in the stochastic setting .",
    "this construction requires @xmath34 agents which is inferior than what achieved by the probabilistic construction by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "we point out that , very recently , atia and saligrama  @xcite developed an information theoretic perspective applicable to a variety of group testing problems , including a `` dilution model '' which is closely related to what we consider in this work .",
    "contrary to our combinatorial approach , they use information theoretic techniques to obtain bounds on the number of required measurements .",
    "their bounds are with respect to random constructions and typical set decoding as the reconstruction method .",
    "specifically , in our terminology with contamination probability @xmath1 , they obtain an information theoretic upper bound of @xmath36 on the number measurements , which is comparable to what we obtain in our probabilistic construction .",
    "as is customary in the standard group testing literature , we think of the spartsity @xmath2 as a parameter that is noticeably smaller than the population size @xmath8 ; for example , one may take @xmath37 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath2 becomes comparable to @xmath8 , there would be little point in using a group testing scheme and in practice , for large @xmath2 it is generally more favorable to perform trivial tests on the individuals .",
    "nevertheless it is easy to observe that our probabilistic scheme can in general achieve @xmath38 , but we ignore such refinements for the sake of clarity .",
    "the problem described in section  [ sec : setting ] has a stochastic nature , in that the sampling matrix is obtained from the contact matrix through a random process . in this section",
    "we introduce an adversarial variation of the problem that we find more convenient to work with .    in the adversarial variation of the problem",
    ", the sampling matrix is obtained from the contact matrix by flipping up to @xmath39 arbitrary entries to @xmath18 on the support ( i.e. , the set of nonzero entries ) of each column of @xmath13 , for some _ error parameter _ @xmath39 .",
    "the goal is to be able to exactly identify the sparse vector despite the perturbation of the contact matrix and regardless of the choice of the altered entries .",
    "note that the classical group testing problem corresponds to the special case @xmath40 .",
    "thus the only difference between the adversarial problem and the stochastic one is that in the former problem the flipped entries of the contact matrix are chosen arbitrarily ( as long as there are not too many flips ) while in the latter they are chosen according to a specific random process .",
    "it turns out that the combinatorial tool required for solving the adversarial problem is precisely the notion of _ disjunct _ matrices that is well studied in the group testing literature .",
    "the formal definition is as follows .",
    "[ defn : disjunct ] a boolean matrix @xmath41 with @xmath8 columns @xmath42 is called @xmath43-disjunct if , for every subset @xmath44 $ ] of the columns with @xmath45 , and every @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the support of the column @xmath49 .",
    "the following proposition shows a one - to - one correspondence between contact matrices suitable for the adversarial problem and disjunct matrices :    [ prop : disjunct ] let @xmath41 be a @xmath50-disjunct matrix .",
    "then taking @xmath41 as the contact matrix solves the adversarial problem for @xmath2-sparse vectors with error parameter @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , any matrix that solves the adversarial problem must be @xmath51-disjunct .",
    "let @xmath41 be a @xmath50-disjunct matrix and consider @xmath2-sparse vectors @xmath52 supported on different subsets @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "take an element @xmath54 which is not in @xmath55 . by definition  [ defn : disjunct",
    "] , we know that the column @xmath49 has more than @xmath39 entries on its support that are not present in the support of any @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , even after @xmath39 bit flips in @xmath49 , at least one entry in its support remains that is not present in the measurement outcome of @xmath57 , and this makes @xmath11 and @xmath57 distinguishable .",
    "for the reverse direction , suppose that @xmath41 is not @xmath58-disjunct and take any @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] with @xmath60 , @xmath46 which demonstrate a counterexample for @xmath41 being @xmath51-disjunct .",
    "consider @xmath2-sparse vectors @xmath11 and @xmath57 supported on @xmath55 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "an adversary can flip up to @xmath39 bits on the support of @xmath49 from @xmath7 to @xmath18 , leave the rest of @xmath41 unchanged , and ensure that the measurement outcomes for @xmath11 and @xmath57 coincide .",
    "thus @xmath41 is not suitable for the adversarial problem .    of course",
    ", posing the adversarial problem is only interesting if it helps in solving the original stochastic problem from which it originates .",
    "below we show that this is indeed the case ; and in fact the task of solving the stochastic problem reduces to that of the adversarial problem ; and thus after this point it suffices to focus on the adversarial problem .",
    "[ prop : advers ] suppose that @xmath41 is an @xmath62 contact matrix that solves the adversarial problem for @xmath2-sparse vectors with some error parameter @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , suppose that the weight of each column of @xmath41 is between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for a parameter @xmath65 and a constant @xmath66 , and that @xmath67 , for a constant @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath41 can be used for the stochastic problem with contamination probability @xmath1 , and achieves error probability at most @xmath69 , where probability is taken over the randomness of sampling ( and the constant behind @xmath70 depends on @xmath1 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "take any column @xmath49 of @xmath41 , and let @xmath72 be its weight .",
    "after the bit flips , we expect the weight of the column to reduce to @xmath73 . moreover , by chernoff bounds , the probability that ( for `` small '' @xmath71 ) the amount of bit flips exceeds @xmath74 is at most @xmath75 thus , by a union bound , the probability that the amount of bit flips at some column is not tolerable by @xmath41 is at most @xmath76 .",
    "note that , as we mentioned earlier , the adversarial problem is stronger than classical group testing , and thus , any lower bound on the number of measurements required for classical group testing applies to our problem as well .",
    "it is known that any measurement matrix that avoids confusion in standard group testing requires at least @xmath77 measurements @xcite .",
    "thus we must necessarily have @xmath78 as well , and this upper bounds the error probability given by proposition  [ prop : advers ] by at most @xmath79 .",
    "suppose that the contact matrix @xmath13 is @xmath80-disjunct .",
    "therefore , by proposition  [ prop : disjunct ] it can combinatorially distinguish between @xmath2-sparse vectors in the adversarial setting with error parameter @xmath39 . in this work we consider a very simple decoder that works as follows .",
    "* distance decoder : * for any column @xmath81 of the contact matrix @xmath13 , the decoder verifies the following : @xmath82 where @xmath22 is the vector consisting of the measurement outcomes .",
    "the coordinate @xmath83 is decided to be nonzero if and only if the inequality holds .",
    "the distance decoder correctly identifies the correct support of any @xmath2-sparse vector ( with the above disjunctness assumption on @xmath41 ) .",
    "let @xmath11 be a @xmath2-sparse vector and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 denote the corresponding set of columns in the sampling matrix .",
    "obviously all the columns in @xmath86 satisfy ( as no column is perturbed in more than @xmath39 positions ) and thus the reconstruction includes the support of @xmath11 ( this is true regardless of the disjunctness property of @xmath41 ) .",
    "now let the vector @xmath87 be the bitwise or of the columns in @xmath86 so that @xmath88 , and assume that there is a column @xmath89 of @xmath13 outside @xmath55 that satisfies . thus we will have @xmath90 , and this violates the assumption that @xmath13 is @xmath50-disjunct .",
    "therefore , the distance decoder outputs the exact support of @xmath11 .",
    "in light of propositions [ prop : disjunct ]  and  [ prop : advers ] , we know that in order to solve the stochastic problem with contamination probability @xmath1 and sparsity @xmath2 , it is sufficient to construct a @xmath80-disjunct matrix for an appropriate choice of @xmath39 . in this section ,",
    "we consider a probabilistic construction for @xmath13 , where each entry of @xmath13 is set to @xmath7 independently with probability @xmath91 , for a parameter @xmath92 to be determined later , and @xmath18 with probability @xmath93 .",
    "we will use standard arguments to show that , if the number of measurements @xmath9 is sufficiently large , then the resulting matrix @xmath13 is suitable with all but a vanishing probability .",
    "let @xmath94 be an arbitrary ( and small ) constant .",
    "using chernoff bounds , we see that if @xmath95 ( which will be the case ) , with probability @xmath0 no column of @xmath13 will have weight greater than @xmath96 or less than @xmath97 . thus in order to be able to apply proposition  [ prop : advers ] , it suffices to set @xmath98 as this value is larger than the error parameter @xmath99 required by the proposition .    for the above choices of the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath39 , the probabilistic construction obtains a @xmath50-disjunct matrix with probability @xmath0 using @xmath3 measurements .",
    "consider any set @xmath55 of @xmath2 columns of @xmath13 , and any column outside these , say the @xmath15th column where @xmath46 .",
    "first we upper bound the probability of a _ failure _ for this choice of @xmath55 and @xmath15 , i.e. , the probability that the number of the positions at the @xmath15th column corresponding to which all the columns in @xmath55 have zeros is at most @xmath39 . clearly if this event happens the @xmath101-disjunct property is violated . on the other hand ,",
    "if for no choice of @xmath55 and @xmath15 a failure happens the matrix is indeed @xmath101-disjunct .",
    "now we compute the failure probability @xmath102 for a fixed @xmath55 and @xmath15 .",
    "a row is _ good _ if at that row the @xmath15th column has a @xmath7 but all the columns in @xmath55 have zeros . for a particular row ,",
    "the probability that the row is good is @xmath103 .",
    "then failure corresponds to the event that the number of good rows is at most @xmath39 .",
    "the distribution on the number of good rows is binomial with mean @xmath104 . by a chernoff bound ,",
    "the failure probability is at most @xmath105 where the last inequality is due to the fact that @xmath106 is always between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 .",
    "note that by choosing the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath71 as sufficiently small constants , @xmath110 can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath111 .",
    "now if we apply a union bound over all possible choices of @xmath55 and @xmath15 , the probability of coming up with a bad choice of @xmath13 would be at most @xmath112 .",
    "this probability vanishes so long as @xmath113 .",
    "along with propositions  [ prop : disjunct ]  and  [ prop : advers ] , the result above immediately gives the following :    the probabilistic design for construction of an @xmath62 contact matrix @xmath13 achieves @xmath3 measurements and error probability at most @xmath114 for the stochastic problem using distance decoder as the reconstruction method .",
    "the probabilistic construction results in a rather sparse matrix , namely , one with density @xmath115 that decays with the sparsity parameter @xmath2 . below we show that sparsity is necessary condition for the construction to work :    let @xmath41 be an @xmath62 boolean random matrix , where @xmath116 for an integer @xmath117 , which is constructed by setting each entry independently to @xmath7 with probability @xmath100 .",
    "then either @xmath118 or otherwise the probability that @xmath41 is @xmath43-disjunct ( for any @xmath119 ) approaches to zero as @xmath8 grows .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 is an @xmath62 matrix that is @xmath43-disjunct .",
    "observe that , for any integer @xmath120 , if we remove any @xmath121 columns of @xmath41 and all the rows on the support of those columns , the matrix must remain @xmath122-disjunct .",
    "this is because any counterexample for the modified matrix being @xmath123-disjunct can be extended to a counterexample for @xmath41 being @xmath43-disjunct by adding the removed columns to its support .",
    "now consider any @xmath121 columns of @xmath41 , and denote by @xmath124 the number of rows of @xmath41 at which the entries corresponding to the chosen columns are all zeros .",
    "the expected value of @xmath124 is @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath94 we have @xmath126 \\leq \\exp ( -\\delta^2 ( 1-q)^t m/4 ) \\ ] ] by a chernoff bound .",
    "let @xmath127 be the largest integer for which @xmath128 .",
    "if @xmath129 , we let @xmath130 above , and this makes the right hand side of upper bounded by @xmath131 .",
    "so with probability @xmath0 , the chosen @xmath121 columns of @xmath41 will keep @xmath124 at most @xmath132 , and removing those columns and @xmath124 rows on their union leaves the matrix @xmath133-disjunct , which obviously requires at least @xmath134 rows ( as even a @xmath135-disjunct matrix needs so many rows ) .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath136 or otherwise ( with overwhelming probability ) @xmath41 will not be @xmath43-disjunct .",
    "but the latter inequality is not satisfied by the assumption on @xmath127 .",
    "so if @xmath129 , little chance remains for @xmath41 to be @xmath43-disjunct .",
    "now consider the case @xmath137 . by a similar argument as above",
    ", we must have @xmath138 or otherwise the matrix will not be @xmath43-disjunct with overwhelming probability .",
    "the above inequality implies that we must have @xmath139 which , for @xmath140 gives @xmath141 .",
    "in the previous section we showed how a random construction of the contact matrix achieves the desired properties for the adversarial ( and thus , stochastic ) model that we consider in this work .",
    "however , in principle an unfortunate choice of the contact matrix might fail to be of use ( for example , it is possible though very unlikely that the contact matrix turns out to be all zeros ) and thus it is of interest to have an explicit and deterministic construction of the contact matrix that is guaranteed to work .    in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate how a classical construction of superimposed codes due to kautz and singleton @xcite can be extended to our setting by a careful choice of the parameters .",
    "this is given by the following theorem .",
    "there is an explicit construction for an @xmath62 contact matrix @xmath13 that is guaranteed to be suitable for the stochastic problem with contamination probability @xmath1 and sparsity parameter @xmath2 , and achieves @xmath142    let @xmath9 be an even power of a prime , and @xmath143 . consider a reed - solomon code of length @xmath144 and dimension @xmath145 over an alphabet of size @xmath144 .",
    "the contact matrix @xmath13 is designed to have @xmath146 columns , one for each codeword .",
    "consider a mapping @xmath147 that maps each element of @xmath148 to a unique canonical basis vector of length @xmath144 ; e.g. , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , etc .",
    "the column corresponding to a codeword @xmath89 is set to the binary vector of length @xmath9 that is obtained by replacing each entry @xmath151 of @xmath89 by @xmath152 , blowing up the length of @xmath89 from @xmath144 to @xmath153 .",
    "note that the number of columns of @xmath13 is @xmath154 , and each column has weight exactly @xmath155 .",
    "moreover , the support of any two distinct columns intersect at less than @xmath145 entries , because of the fact that the underlying reed - solomon code is an mds code and has minimum distance @xmath156 .",
    "thus in order to ensure that @xmath13 is @xmath50-disjunct , it suffices to have @xmath157 ( so that no set of @xmath2 columns of @xmath13 can cover too many entries of any column outside the set ) , or equivalently , @xmath158 by proposition  [ prop : advers ] , we need to set @xmath159 for an arbitrary constant @xmath94 . thus in order to satisfy  , it suffices to have @xmath160 , which gives @xmath161 .",
    "as @xmath71 can be chosen arbitrarily small , the denominator can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath162 and thus we conclude that this construction achieves @xmath163 measurements , which is essentially larger than the amount achieved by the probabilistic construction by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "observe that , unlike the probabilistic construction of the previous section , the explicit construction above guarantees a correct reconstruction in the adversarial setting ( where up to a @xmath19 fraction of the entries on the support of each column of the contact matrix might be flipped to zero ) .",
    "moreover , in the original stochastic setting with contamination probability @xmath1 , a single matrix given by the explicit construction guarantees correct reconstruction with overwhelming probability , where the probability is only over the randomness of the testing procedure .",
    "this is in contrast with the probabilistic construction where the failure probability is small , but originates from two sources ; namely , unfortunate outcome of the testing procedure as well as unfortunate choice of the contact matrix @xmath13 .",

    "<S> more precisely , for a contamination probability @xmath1 , the number of agents required by the probabilistic and explicit designs for identification of up to @xmath2 infected members is bounded by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> a simple decoder is able to successfully identify the infected population in time @xmath5 . </S>"
