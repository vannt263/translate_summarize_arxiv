    "out of equilibrium quantum fluids such as polaritons in semiconductor microcavities are being the subject of an intensive study .",
    "microcavity polaritons , the quasiparticles resulting from the strong coupling of cavity photons and quantum well excitons , have the prerogative of being easy to both manipulate , via an external laser , and detect , via the light escaping from the cavity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , resonant excitation allows the accurate tuning of the fluid properties , such as its density and current .",
    "however , the polariton lifetime being finite establishes the system as intrinsically out of equilibrium : an external pump is needed to continuously replenish the cavity of polaritons , that quickly , on a scale of tens of picoseconds , escape .",
    "recently , the superfluid properties of a resonantly pumped polariton quantum fluid in the pump - only configuration  i.e. , where no other states aside the pump one are occupied by , e.g. , parametric scattering  have been actively investigated both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "this pumping scheme , differently from other cases , such as the resonant optical parametric oscillator regime and the non - resonant pumping scheme , creates a polariton fluid that , inside the pump spot , is not characterised by a free phase . on the contrary , the phase of the pump state is locked to the one of the external pumping laser . nevertheless , it has been predicted  @xcite and observed  @xcite that scattering can be suppressed below a critical velocity , where the system displays superfluid behaviour , similarly to what has been predicted by the landau criterion for equilibrium superfluid condensates .",
    "further , a fixed phase clearly prevents the formation of phase dislocations , such as vortices and solitons . for this reason ,",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite and experimentally realised  @xcite that the defect can be located just outside the pump spot , where the hydrodynamic nucleation of vortices , vortex - antivortex pairs , arrays of vortices , and solitons can be observed when the fluid collides with the extended defect .",
    "similarly , nucleation of vortices in the wake of the obstacle has been observed in pulsed experiments  @xcite .    in a conservative quantum liquid flowing past a small defect , the landau criterion for superfluidity links the onset of dissipation at a critical fluid velocity with the shape of the fluid collective excitation spectrum  @xcite . in particular , for weakly interacting bose gases",
    ", the dispersion of the low - energy excitation modes being linear implies that the critical velocity for superflow coincides with the speed of sound @xmath0 . clearly , this is strictly correct only for vanishingly small perturbations  @xcite , while for a defect with finite size and strength , the critical velocity can be smaller than @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "however , even for perturbatively weak defects , in out - of - equilibrium systems , where the spectrum of excitations is complex , the validity of the landau criterion has to be questioned  @xcite . in the particular case of coherently driven polaritons in the pump - only configuration ,",
    "it has been predicted  @xcite , and later observed  @xcite , that scattering is suppressed at either strong enough pump powers or small enough flow velocities . yet , on a closer scrutiny , it has been shown that , despite the apparent validity of the landau criterion , the system always experiences a residual drag force even in the limit of asymptotically large densities  @xcite or small velocities .",
    "this result has been proven by numerically solving the gross - pitaevskii equation describing the resonantly - driven polariton system in presence of a non - perturbative extended defect . here , the drag force exerted by the defect on the fluid has been shown to display a smooth crossover from the subsonic to the supersonic regime , similarly to what it has been found in the case of non - resonantly pumped polaritons  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we find an even richer phenomenology for the dependence of the drag force on the fluid velocity and two different kinds of crossovers from the sub- to the supercritical regime .",
    "further , we show that the origin of the residual drag force , which , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , lies in the polariton lifetime only , can be demonstrated even within a linear response approximation .",
    "more specifically , in this work , we apply the linear response theory to analytically evaluate the drag force exerted by the coherently driven polariton fluid in the pump - only configuration on a point - like defect . to simplify the formalism ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of resonant pumping close to the bottom of the lower polariton dispersion , where the dispersion is quadratic . here , the properties of the collective excitation spectrum have been shown to be uniquely determined by three parameters only  @xcite : the fluid velocity @xmath1 , the interaction - renormalised pump detuning @xmath2 , and the polariton lifetime @xmath3 . in particular , the sign of the detuning @xmath2 determines three qualitatively different types of spectra : linear for @xmath4 , diffusive - like for @xmath5 , and gapped for @xmath6 .    for both cases of linear and diffusive spectra , we find a qualitatively similar behaviour of the drag force as a function of the fluid velocity @xmath1 : in particular , the drag displays a crossover from a subsonic or superfluid regime  characterised by the absence of quasiparticle excitations  to a supersonic regime  where cherenkov - like waves are generated by the defect and propagate into the fluid .",
    "the crossover becomes sharper for increasing polariton lifetimes @xmath7 and displays the typical threshold behaviour for @xmath8 with a critical velocity given by the speed of sound of linear regime , @xmath9 , exactly as for weakly interacting equilibrium superfluids ( in the case of perturbatively weak defects ) .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the one predicted for polariton superfluids excited non - resonantly  @xcite , where the spectrum in that case is diffusive - like .",
    "however , for gapped spectra at @xmath10 , we find that the critical velocity governing the drag crossover exceeds the speed of sound , @xmath11 , and we determine an analytical expression of @xmath12 as a function of the detuning @xmath2 .",
    "further , for @xmath8 , the drag has a threshold - like behaviour qualitatively different from the one of weakly interacting equilibrium superfluids , with the drag jumping discontinuously from zero to a finite value at @xmath13 .",
    "we evaluate the drag as a function of the polariton lifetime @xmath3 and find for all three cases that : in the supercritical regime , @xmath14 , the lifetime tends to suppress the propagation of the cherenkov waves away from the defect and therefore to suppress the drag .",
    "instead , well in the subcritical regime , @xmath15 , we find that the residual drag goes linearly to zero with the polariton lifetime @xmath3 , in agreement to what it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , by making use of a non - perturbative numerical analysis for a finite size defect .",
    "similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , here , we do also find that the residual drag in the subcritical regime can be explained in terms of an asymmetric perturbation induced in the fluid by the defect in the direction of the fluid velocity .",

    "moreover , starting from a formulation in terms of coupled exciton and photon fields , the polariton lifetime would be momentum dependent and , similarly , the polariton - polariton interaction strength @xmath30 is not contact - like as instead assumed in eq .  .",
    "however , as shown in appendix  [ app : full ] , these simplifications , do not affect our results qualitatively , rather , allow to write them in terms of simpler expressions .",
    "further , we have checked that , whenever the system is excited near the bottom of the lower polariton dispersion , the results for the drag force reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : drag ] coincide with the ones obtained by using an exact photon - exciton coupled field description .",

    "later on , we will assume the defect to be point - like @xmath32 and weak , so that we can apply the linear response approximation  @xcite . in this treatment ,",
    "one divides the response of the lp field in a mean - field component @xmath33 corresponding to the case when the perturbing potential is absent , and a fluctuation part @xmath34 reflecting the linear response of the system to the perturbing potential : @xmath35 \\ ; . \\label{eq : mfield}\\ ] ] by substituting   into  , we obtain a mean - field equation and , by retaining only the linear terms in the fluctuation field and the defect potential , the following first order equation in @xmath36 : @xmath37 where the operator @xmath38 is given by : @xmath39 with latexmath:[$\\widetilde{\\omega_{lp } } = \\omega_{lp}-\\omega_p + 2 g    mean - field equation for @xmath33 , as this has been already widely studied  @xcite .",

    "this , as we will see in the next section , will imply that the drag force for @xmath8 goes abruptly , rather than continuously , from zero at @xmath69 to a finite value at @xmath72 .",

    "we also note that for these spectra , even if considering only the real part of the collective excitation spectrum , as soon as the fluid is in motion @xmath89 , dissipation in the form of waves is possible .",

    "the cone was gradually closing with increasing the fluid velocity .",

    "@xcite . instead , in the supersonic regime",

    "however , for negative pump detuning , where the spectrum of excitations is gapped , the drag shows a discontinuity with a critical velocity larger than the speed of sound . in this sense , the case of coherently driven microcavity polaritons in the pump - only configuration displays a richer phenomenology than the case of polariton superfluids non resonantly pumped",
