    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of dilute atomic gases has been achieved in a variety of atomic samples using different magnetic and optical traps  @xcite .",
    "these advances have resulted in a investigations of properties of these ultra - cold gases in different conditions . at present",
    ", there is considerable interest in bec in low dimensions where particle motion is restricted in one or more dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this is because a bose gas confined in low dimensions shows remarkably different behaviour than it shows in three dimensions .",
    "for example , a two - dimensional homogeneous bose gas does not undergo bose - einstein condensation on cooling . instead",
    ", there is a phase transition called berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless transition in which system becomes superfluid without having long - range ordering . for a homogeneous bose gas confined in one dimension , bec does not exist even at absolute zero .",
    "however , in inhomogeneous confining potentials bec can exist in lower dimensions also  @xcite .",
    "recently , several groups have experimentally investigated the properties of bose condensates confined in the low dimensions  @xcite . to investigate the macroscopic quantum behaviour of these systems ,",
    "the study of collective modes has proved to be a fundamental tool .",
    "usually , the theoretical description of these dynamical properties such as collective modes of a bose condensate can be accomplished by gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation taking interaction energy within the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , it is known that the mean - field theory gives accurate results only in the regime of small values of gas parameter(@xmath0 is density and @xmath1 is scattering length ) . with the recent experimental advances in this field , access to the large gas parameter regime has become feasible either by increasing the number of atoms in the condensate or by increasing the scattering length via feshbach resonances .",
    "therefore it is essential to assess the gp theory in this regime . in the present theoretical studies",
    ", we have calculated the collective mode frequencies of a q2d gas in the regime of large gas parameter by using a perturbative expansion for the interaction energy .",
    "we have incorporated the lee , huang and yang ( lhy ) correction term in the energy expansion to go beyond the mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "we find that detectable changes in the collective mode frequencies can occur when we incorpoarte the lhy correction term in the energy expansion .",
    "the gp equation for a condensate admits formulations in terms of the hamilton least action principle with the action functional given as , @xmath2 here @xmath3 is lagrangian density and is given by , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is trapping potential , @xmath6 is mass of the atom , @xmath7 is self interaction energy , @xmath8 is condensate wave function and @xmath9 is density(@xmath10 ) .",
    "the normalization condition is , @xmath11 by evaluating lagrangian for a trial wave function , the solution of lagrange s equations gives the parameters used in the trial wavefunction .    in the large gas parameter regime",
    ", we use the perturbative expansion  @xcite for the interaction energy @xmath7 beyond mean field approximation by including the correction term calculated by lee , huang and yang ( lhy )  @xcite as following ,    @xmath12 ,",
    "\\label{eq : int_energy}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 . here",
    "the first term in the expression of interaction energy @xmath7 represents the mean - field energy whereas the second term represents the lhy correction term .",
    "it is also known that this expansion is valid upto @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "further , we assume that the bose condensate is trapped in a harmonic potential of the form ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the trap frequencies along x , y and z - axes respectively .    in the q2d regime of confinement ,",
    "the condensate is supposed to be confined in a trap which has frequency along one axis ( z - axis ) much larger than the frequencies along the other two axes ( x - axis and y - axis ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath17 and motion in z - direction is frozen .",
    "however , the oscillator lengths @xmath18 along the three axes of the trap are still much larger than the scattering length so that the collisions are three dimensional . for the scattering length @xmath19 larger or comparable to the oscillator length along the confining axis ,",
    "the scattering properties become significantly different from those of a three - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the chosen parameters for the condensate are such the nonlinear energy is smaller than the zero point energy implying that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the size of the cloud in the x - y plane . throughout the studies",
    "we have restricted @xmath22 and @xmath19 so that the above conditions are satisfied . under these conditions",
    "we can write the condensate wave function @xmath8 in a factorized form as following  @xcite ,    @xmath23    we take the wave function along z - axis as @xmath24 \\label{eq : wf_z}\\ ] ] such that @xmath25 in order to study the time evolution of a bose condensate confined in a q2d trap as described above , we choose the general trial wavefunction in x - y coordinates as , @xmath26\\right)}\\right ] , \\label{eq : wf_var_xy}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are time dependent complex variational parameters .",
    "we have taken the trap to be anisotropic in the x - y plane with anisotropy parameter @xmath30 given by @xmath31 . in",
    "equation ( [ eq : wf_var_xy ] ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are dimensionless coordinate variables with @xmath34 .",
    "we can write the condensate parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the inverse square of the widths along x and y - axes respectively .",
    "the imaginary parts @xmath38 and @xmath39 account for the time dependent phases .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 representing the cross term in the coordinates account for the scissors modes of collective oscillation  @xcite . from the normalisation condition we can find that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .    by substituting equations ( [ eq : ld])-([eq : wf_var_xy ] ) in equation ( [ eq : action ] )",
    ", we can evaluate lagrangian as    @xmath44    where    to know the static properties of the condensate , we substitute the static values of different parameters as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 in the lagrangian in equation ( [ eq : lag ] ) . then , from the lagrange s equations of motion , we can obtain the following coupled equations for @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 where ,    these equations are coupled nonlinear equations .",
    "the terms with @xmath52 as coefficient in the above expressions appear due to the incorporation of lhy correction in the energy @xmath7 .",
    "for the known values of parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) for the condensate in a q2d trap , the static size - parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 along x and y - axes can be evaluated by solving the above equations .",
    "we have solved these equations numerically .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 obtained thus have been used for the calculation of collective mode frequencies as described in the following section .",
    "the low energy excitations of condensate correspond to the small oscillations in the cloud around the equilibrium configuration .",
    "therefore we can expand the time dependent variational parameters around their static values in the following manner ,    @xmath56    after substituting the above values in the lagrangian in equation ( [ eq : lag ] ) and using the euler - lagrange equations , the time evolution of the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be obtained as @xmath60\\delta\\alpha_{1 } \\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{\\omega^{2}_{0}a^{2}_{0}}{2}\\frac{\\alpha^{2}_{10}}{\\beta_{10}}\\left[k_{1}(\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10})^{1/2}+{\\frac{9}{4}}{k}_{2}(\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10})^{3/4}\\right ] \\delta\\beta_{1}=0 , \\label{eq : alp}\\\\ \\ddot{\\delta\\beta_{1}}+\\omega^{2}_{0}{a}^{2}_{0}\\left[{\\frac{4}{\\lambda{a}^{2}_{0}}}-{\\frac{k_1}{2}}{\\beta_{10}}\\sqrt{\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10}}- { \\frac{3}{8}}{k}_{2}\\beta_{10}(\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10})^{3/4}\\right]\\delta\\beta_{1 } \\nonumber \\\\ + \\frac{\\omega^{2}_{0}a^{2}_{0}}{2}\\frac{\\beta^{2}_{10}}{\\alpha_{10}}\\left[k_{1}(\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10})^{1/2}+{\\frac{9}{4}}{k}_{2}(\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10})^{3/4}\\right]\\delta\\alpha_{1}=0 , \\label{eq : bet}\\\\ \\ddot{\\delta\\gamma_{1}}+\\omega^{2}_{0}\\left[\\left(\\lambda+{\\frac{1}{\\lambda}}\\right)+2{a}^{4}_{0}\\alpha_{10}\\beta_{10}\\right]\\delta\\gamma_{1}={0}. \\label{eq : gam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations ( [ eq : alp ] ) - ( [ eq : gam ] ) , the first two equations ( i.e. ( [ eq : alp ] ) and ( [ eq : bet ] ) ) are the coupled equations for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these equations represent the monopole and quadrupole modes of collective oscillations .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : gam ] ) for @xmath59 is not coupled to the other two and represents the scissors mode of collective oscillation  @xcite . in order to calculate the the mode frequencies , we take the harmonic time dependence of amplitudes as @xmath61    this results in the solution for mode frequencies as @xmath62^{1/2 } \\label{eq : monoquad}\\ ] ] and @xmath63 where ,    here @xmath64 is monopole mode frequency , @xmath65 is quadrupole mode frequency and @xmath66 is scissors mode frequency .",
    "the terms with @xmath67 as coefficient in the above expressions of frequencies represent the corrections due to lhy term in the interaction energy @xmath7 .",
    "it can be noted that monopole and quadrupole mode frequencies depend explicitly upon @xmath67 whereas scissors mode frequency does not depend upon it .",
    "variation of monopole mode frequency @xmath64 with scattering length ( i.e. @xmath68 , @xmath69 is scattering length in absence of magnetic field ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mono ] .",
    "it is evident that with finite value of @xmath67 , monopole mode frequency changes with @xmath68 in a differnt manner than that with @xmath70 .",
    "the frequency values from the two curves differ in quantitative as well as in qualitative manner as shown in the figure . after the initial fall in the frequency @xmath71 with increasing @xmath68 ,",
    "it becomes nearly constant if @xmath72 .",
    "however for a finite value of @xmath73 , after the initial fall , there is monotonous increase in @xmath71 values with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "although the modifications in the values of @xmath71 with finite @xmath73 are just by a few percent , nonetheless , they can be easily detected as has been pointed out earlier  @xcite .",
    "as has been discussed earlier  @xcite the splitting between quadrupole and scissors modes occurs in a 2d anisotropic trapped bose condensate .",
    "the value of mode splitting ( @xmath74 ) depends upon anisotropy and interaction strength . to assess the effect of lhy term on the value of @xmath75 , we have calculated it as function of @xmath76 for finite @xmath67 as well as for @xmath67 = 0 .",
    "the results are as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : scissor ] .",
    "the values shown here are for anisotropy parameter @xmath77 .",
    "as is evident from the figure , the splitting @xmath75 calculated with finite @xmath73 keeps on changing with @xmath76 whereas it becomes nearly constant with @xmath76 for @xmath78 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scissors mode frequency @xmath66 does not explicitly depend upon the lhy term ( i.e. @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , its dependence on this term occurs via parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which is quite small .",
    "therefore the difference in the @xmath75 values in two curves in fig.[fig : scissor ] arises mainly due to dependence of quadrupole frequency @xmath65 on the terms containing @xmath52 .",
    "we have theoretically studied the collective mode frequencies of a quasi two - dimensional bose condensate in the large gas parameter regime .",
    "we find that in this regime , the inclusion of lhy correction term beyond the mean - field term in the interaction energy leads to quantitative as well as qualitative changes in the dependence of collective mode frequencies on interaction strength . such regime of parameters is experimentally accessible with the present advancements in this field and modifications in the mode frequencies are easily detectable .",
