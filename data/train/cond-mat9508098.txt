    "in recent years , considerable attention has been devoted to ground - state properties of low - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the interest was greatly stimulated by the discovery of the high - temperature superconductivity,@xcite and by subsequent studies which revealed the importance of the cuo@xmath0 plane of high-@xmath1 materials .",
    "however , complete understanding of the high-@xmath1 mechanism still appears to be beyond our reach .",
    "a possible new approach to the high-@xmath1 mechanism was provided by a recent experiment@xcite on the novel material sr@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "this material has periodic line defects in the cuo@xmath0 plane , and thus is composed of ladders with @xmath5 legs interacting weakly with each other .",
    "the limit @xmath6 yields the high-@xmath1 superconductors .    at half - filling this material",
    "may be described well by the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model defined on a ladder : @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9 spin at the @xmath10th site of the @xmath11th chain .",
    "we put @xmath12 hereafter . )",
    "it was reported,@xcite indeed , that the double chain ( @xmath13 ) with @xmath14 develops the paring correlation upon doping .",
    "this report was followed by the suggestion@xcite that a set of ladders interacting weakly with frustration might show the superconductivity .",
    "thus , characterization of the ground state of the ladder models can be an essential step to understanding the high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "it has been conjectured@xcite for @xmath15 that the ground state of the model ( [ hamil ] ) with even @xmath5 is spin liquid with the energy gap , while that with odd @xmath5 is critical , or gapless .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a theorem,@xcite numerical calculations up to @xmath16,@xcite and a scaling theory.@xcite in order to explain this remarkable conjecture intuitively , white _ et al._@xcite  proposed a resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) picture of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic ladder models .",
    "this was followed by a proposal@xcite of a hidden - order correlation for the rvb ground state of the double chain : @xmath17 the existence of the long - range rvb correlation supported@xcite the rvb picture for @xmath13 .",
    "the present rvb correlation ( [ rvb_double ] ) was also shown@xcite to be very useful in discussing another issue , namely the criticality of the model ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "suppose that we change the value of the coupling across the ladder , @xmath18 ( the inter - chain coupling ) .",
    "then the above conjecture arises the following question .",
    "the model is known to be critical , or gapless@xcite for @xmath19 , whereas the model has the gap for @xmath20 according to the above conjecture . how does the energy gap emerge as @xmath18 changes ? in the previous paper@xcite we presented numerical calculations of the rvb correlations as well as another hidden - order correlation , namely the string correlation:@xcite @xmath21",
    "we showed@xcite quite clearly for @xmath13 that the energy gap appears as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with other studies.@xcite    hidden correlations were first introduced to investigate the ground state of the integer-@xmath24 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains .",
    "the hidden correlations relevant to the model are the following string correlations,@xcite .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 denote the @xmath27 spins .",
    "the correlations successfully detected the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) structure@xcite of the ground state of the integer - spin chains as well as their criticality.@xcite    now that we know the usefulness of the rvb correlation in the case @xmath13 , it is a challenging problem to generalize the definition ( [ rvb_double ] ) to higher @xmath5 , and to explore the ground state and the criticality of general @xmath5 ladder models . here",
    "we consider the ground state of the ladder model with _",
    "four _ legs .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by ( [ hamil ] ) with @xmath16 .",
    "we generalize the definitions ( [ rvb_double ] ) and ( [ string_double ] ) for the four - leg ladder , and show the rvb structure of the ground state in terms of the correlations .",
    "we also confirm the prediction of the scaling theory@xcite that the ground - state phase diagram consists of two disordered phases covering @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and the critical point between them , @xmath30 .",
    "this phase diagram is the same as in the two - leg case.@xcite    the ground - state properties are known in some cases . in the limit @xmath31 , the model is decoupled to independent four - spin rungs .",
    "the ground state is given by the product of singlets formed on the rungs.@xcite therefore , the energy gap is given by @xmath32 in this strong - coupling region . at the isotropic point @xmath33 , which is of experimental interest,@xcite the energy gap @xmath34 and the correlation length @xmath35",
    "have been numerically estimated as @xmath36 and @xmath37.@xcite at @xmath19 the model is reduced to four @xmath38 heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chains .",
    "hence , it is critical as noted above . in the limit @xmath39",
    ", the model converges to the @xmath27 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain , which is massive according to the haldane conjecture.@xcite the haldane conjecture for @xmath27 has been confirmed numerically.@xcite    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce hidden correlations in the next section , and present a naive discussion on the existence of the hidden correlations in terms of the rvb argument . in section 3 ,",
    "we show numerical results of the hidden correlations with an emphasis on the case @xmath33 , where the corresponding material is available .",
    "we also present an argument on the existence of the rvb structure by considering two double - chain ladders coupled weakly .",
    "this argument intuitively shows the nature of the rvb ground state . in section 4",
    ", we elaborate on the criticality of the model in terms of the hidden correlations . in the last section ,",
    "we give a summary of the present paper .",
    "in this section , we introduce the hidden correlations for the present four - leg - ladder model ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "they are defined so that they can detect expected rvb patterns .",
    "we present schematic drawings of the expected rvb patterns in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) for @xmath28 and ( b ) for @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "each rvb pattern is arranged as follows .",
    "first for @xmath28 , white _ et al._@xcite proposed that the ground state is dominated by the rvb pattern with vertical singlets and horizontal singlets .",
    "the state is stabilized by the resonance between the configuration of two adjacent vertical singlets and the configuration of two horizontal singlets ; see fig .",
    "this rvb picture was reported@xcite to be very useful for understanding several features of the ladder models .",
    "second , the expected rvb pattern for @xmath29 is given as follows . in the limit @xmath39 , the system ( [ hamil ] ) with @xmath16 converges to the @xmath27 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "the ground state of the chain was described@xcite well in terms of the @xmath27 valence - bond - solid state .",
    "this vbs state is constructed in the following manner : suppose that each spin with @xmath27 consists of four spins with @xmath38 ; form a singlet using two @xmath38 spin of neighbouring sites ; arrange the singlets so that each bond may have two singlets .",
    "all the @xmath38 spins are thus connected each other with the short - range valence bonds consequently .",
    "we expect this state in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "the resonance may arise among the different pairing patterns for finite and negative @xmath18 .",
    "hence we have drawn the pattern which is shown in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "we expect that this pattern dominates in the whole region @xmath29 .    in order to detect the above rvb patterns , we define the following hidden correlations : @xmath40 and @xmath41 we here generalized the hidden correlations ( [ rvb_double ] ) and ( [ string_double ] ) , which have been applied to the double - chain ladder model.@xcite the angle @xmath42 appearing in ( [ rvb_double ] ) and ( [ string_double ] ) is replaced by @xmath43 in the present definitions ( [ rvb ] ) and ( [ string ] ) .",
    "we show in the present paper that the choice @xmath44 is the most relevant to the four - chain ladder model .",
    "we also show that the correlation ( [ rvb ] ) develops in the phase @xmath28 while the corelation ( [ string ] ) develops in the phase @xmath29 .",
    "let us explain the reasons of these facts briefly , before going into details in  3 and 4    first , in the limit @xmath39 , the model converges to the @xmath27 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain , as is explained in the previous section .",
    "the correlation ( [ string ] ) then is reduced to @xmath45 where @xmath46 denote the @xmath27 spins . this correlation with @xmath44 is reported to remain finite in the limit @xmath47,@xcite as was mentioned in  1 .",
    "the correlation ( [ rvb ] ) , on the other hand , remains finite in the limit @xmath31 ; see the next section .",
    "second , as was done for the double - chain ladder model,@xcite we can show the existence of hidden orders schematically as follows . consider any spin configurations of the four - leg ladder , satisfying the rvb pattern of fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . we present an example in fig .",
    "we notice that the set of the numbers @xmath48 in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) satisfies the condition @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to the formation of two singlets over two neighboring composite spins @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to see that the quantity @xmath53 remains finite for any @xmath10 and @xmath54 , when it is averaged over all configurations that satisfy the condition ( [ condition]).@xcite this explains that the rvb correlation ( [ rvb ] ) remains finite if the rvb configurations as fig .",
    "1 ( a ) are dominant in the ground state .",
    "the above argument applies to the rvb patterns as fig . 1 ( b )",
    "if we define the composite spin as @xmath55 ; see fig .",
    "2 ( b ) . we can expect that local destruction of the rvb patterns does not result in vanishing of the long - range correlation.@xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate the ground state of the four - leg ladder by means of the hidden correlations ( [ rvb ] ) and ( [ string ] ) numerically .",
    "the rvb picture explained in the above section is confirmed .",
    "we show that the choice @xmath44 is the most relevant to the present system .",
    "in this subsection , we concentrate on the four - leg ladder in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "the limiting point is expected to be the fixed point of the phase @xmath28.@xcite .",
    "hence , characteristics at the point may be relevant to those of the whole region @xmath28 .    in this limit @xmath31 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is reduced to a set of independent rungs .",
    "the ground state is given by the direct product of singlets that are formed on the rungs .",
    "we can calculate the long - range limit of the hidden correlations ( [ rvb ] ) and ( [ string ] ) exactly .",
    "though the ground state is spin liquid.@xcite the hidden correlation ( [ rvb ] ) is long - ranged .",
    "the correlation @xmath56 is plotted against @xmath43 in fig .",
    "3 . the correlation has the maximum around @xmath57 , while the correlations at @xmath58 and @xmath42 are both vanishing .",
    "these behaviors are intrinsic to the whole region of the phase @xmath28 as we see below .",
    "it is apparent , on the other hand , that the correlation ( [ string ] ) is of short range , @xmath59 .      in this subsection ,",
    "we concentrate on the system at @xmath33 , where the interaction is spatially isotropic .",
    "this isotropic system is of experimental interest.@xcite .",
    "a strong - inter - chain - coupling expansion starts to fail at this point.@xcite we employed the density - matrix renormalization - group method @xcite in order to treat large systems approximately .",
    "we conclude that ground state properties are indeed consistent with the rvb picture given in the previous section and the recent proposal that the point @xmath31 is the fixed point of the phase @xmath28.@xcite    first of all , we show the precision of the present renormalization - group calculation . in fig .",
    "4 we plotted the relative error of the ground state energy with @xmath33 and @xmath60 against the approximate level @xmath61 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is the number of states kept;@xcite in this method , we treat only @xmath61 states in the course of the renormalization .",
    "it should be noted that the precision of the correlations is worse than that of the ground - state energy .",
    "the reason may be as follows .",
    "because the hilbert space is restricted to the @xmath61 states , this renormalization - group method may be regarded as a kind of variational method . in many cases ,",
    "the variational calculation yields worse estimation for the correlation functions .",
    "the correlations @xmath62 and @xmath63 are plotted in fig .",
    "5 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the maxima of the correlations are located around @xmath44 .",
    "this is also reported in the previous subsection for the system with @xmath31 .",
    "we hence observe that the most relevant angle for the correlations is given by @xmath57 as is expected from the discussions in  2 . in order to estimate the infinite distance limit of the correlations",
    ", we plotted @xmath64 and @xmath65 against @xmath66 in fig .",
    "6 ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , respectively .",
    "the correlation ( [ rvb ] ) remains finite ; @xmath67 ( the correlation would have developed fully as @xmath68 , if the ground state satisfied the condition ( [ condition ] ) completely . ) on the other hand , it is seen that the correlation ( [ string ] ) is very small .",
    "considering the precision of the numerical calculators , we conclude that the correlation ( [ string ] ) is of short range .",
    "finally , we show the results of the correlation ( [ rvb ] ) with the angle @xmath58 .",
    "note that this is nothing but the nel correlation .",
    "we present a semi - logarithmic plot of the correlation against @xmath69 ; see fig .",
    "it is seen that it does decrease exponentially .",
    "the correlation length is somewhat consistent with an estimate in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we clarify the essential mechanism of the development of the correlation ( [ rvb ] ) with @xmath44 in the region @xmath28 .    for this purpose ,",
    "let us decouple the four - leg ladder system into two ladder systems .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath70 the effect of the inter - ladder coupling @xmath71 is analysed with the aid of numerical simulations below .",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that the decoupled system ( @xmath72 ) is a convenient starting point for investigating the four - leg ladder .",
    "first , we consider the completely decoupled case @xmath72 .",
    "the hidden correlation ( [ rvb ] ) is reduced to @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the brackets here denote the ground - state expectation value of a single two - leg ladder system .    in fig .",
    "8 , we show an example of spin configurations @xmath76 and @xmath77 for each single - ladder system .",
    "the configurations are expressed in terms of the height of steps .",
    "the upward ( downward ) step at the position @xmath10 of the upper drawing stands for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the same rule applies to the lower drawing .",
    "the example here satisfies the conditions @xmath80 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; therefore the sites with the magnetization @xmath81 and @xmath82 appear alternately with the sites with @xmath83 being inserted between them .",
    "indeed , such configurations are expected to dominate the ground state of the two - leg ladder system @xcite , according to the rvb theory for the two - leg ladder.@xcite rvb pattern as in fig .",
    "9 satisfies the condition ( [ conditions ] ) .",
    "we calculated the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ decoupled_rvb ] ) for the exemplified configuration in fig . 8 fixing the angle @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "the expectation values indicated in fig .",
    "8 are the average over the depicted configuration and the reflected ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) one .",
    "we can see that the correlation ( [ decoupled_rvb ] ) does not vanish only at the sites where the steps of the upper and lower ladders synchronize coincidently .",
    "we can also show after a similar analysis that the hidden correlation ( [ rvb ] ) does not develop for @xmath58 and @xmath86 , if we restrict the configurations with the condition ( [ conditions ] ) .",
    "this is the same as what we observe in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , the analysis based on the decoupled system appears to be fairly relevant .",
    "now we investigate the effect of the inter - ladder coupling in terms of the above rvb picture numerically . as a consequence , we present more detailed information on the rvb pattern . in fig .",
    "10 , we show the hidden correlation ( [ rvb ] ) for the system with @xmath60 , @xmath33 and @xmath71 varied . we observe that the inter - ladder coupling @xmath71 stabilizes the hidden correlation .",
    "recall that the essential mechanism of the development of the rvb correlation is the synchronization of the configurations of the upper - half ladder and the lower - half ladder ; see fig . 8 .",
    "the rvb correlation @xmath87 for @xmath72 expresses the contribution of the coincidental synchronization .",
    "we can observe from fig .",
    "10 that the inter - ladder coupling enhances the synchronization .",
    "we can explain the reason of the enhancement as follows . according to the rvb picture ,",
    "the ground state is stabilized by the resonance between the configuration of two vertical singlets and that of two horizontal singlets.@xcite when the inter - ladder coupling @xmath71 is turned on , the resonance shown in fig .",
    "11 becomes possible . to take advantage of the resonance , singlets along the upper - half ladder and those along the lower - half ladder may tend to appear at the same position @xmath10 .",
    "this effect can enhance the synchronization of the configurations .",
    "in this section , we investigate the development of the hidden correlations ( [ rvb ] ) and ( [ string ] ) and their criticality when we change the parameter @xmath18 . we show the results of the exact - diagonalization method under the periodic - boundary condition .",
    "the result is consistent with that of the scaling theory@xcite .",
    "we plotted the values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the system of the size @xmath90 and @xmath91 in fig .",
    "12 . as is expected , we observe that the correlation @xmath92 develops in the region @xmath28 , while the correlation @xmath93 develops in the region @xmath29 .",
    "we readily know the values of the correlations in two limiting cases . in the limit @xmath31",
    ", we showed @xmath94 . in the limit @xmath39",
    ", the corelation ( [ string ] ) corresponds to the string correlation of the @xmath27 heisenberg chain .",
    "it is reported@xcite that we have @xmath95 .    in order to see the development of the correlations and the criticality , we calculated the squared order parameters , @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 we plotted the results in fig . 13 ( a ) and ( b ) , scaling the data by the factor @xmath100 .",
    "this is because of the following reason . at the critical point @xmath30",
    ", the correlations are reduced to @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the string correlation for the @xmath9 heisenberg chain:@xcite @xmath103 if we know the correlation exponent of ( [ halfstring ] ) defined in @xmath104 the relation ( [ square ] ) is immediately followed by @xmath105 both for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "generalizing hida s analysis@xcite we obtain the formula @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the exponent is given by @xmath109 .",
    "the scaled order parameters are invariant at the critical point for various system sizes . in fig .",
    "13 ( a ) and ( b ) , we observe the crossing points close to the expected critical point @xmath30.@xcite ( another crossing point which appears in fig .",
    "13 ( b ) around @xmath110 may have arose owing to the limited system size . )",
    "the hidden correlations appear to obey the behavior explained in  2 .",
    "the ground state of the four - chain ladder model with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic inter - chain coupling @xmath18 has been analysed by means of the hidden correlations ( [ rvb ] ) and ( [ string ] ) .",
    "the hidden correlations can indicate the development of the corresponding rvb states .",
    "the hidden correlation ( [ rvb ] ) develops in the phase @xmath28 , while the hidden correlation ( [ string ] ) develops in the phase @xmath29 .",
    "though both the two phases are disordered , they are characterized in terms of the hidden long - range orders .",
    "it indicates that the rvb structure varies drastically at the critical point @xmath30 .",
    "these results are consistent with a recent proposal@xcite that the point @xmath31 @xmath111 is the fixed point of the region @xmath28 @xmath112 .",
    "a detailed analysis of rvb pattern has been reported for the phase @xmath28 .",
    "it implies that valence bonds formed along the ladder are not negligible as are in the case of the double - chain ladder model.@xcite this tendency may be more apparent as the number of the legs is increased .",
    "we are in position to conclude that , in the phase @xmath28 , the ground state of the ladder models with two and four legs is the rvb state proposed by white _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the rvb pattern may be common to the arbitrary ladder models with even legs .",
