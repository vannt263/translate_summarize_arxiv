    "the study of baryon excitations provides valuable insight into the forces of confinement and the nature of qcd in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the experimental effort currently under way at jefferson lab which is accumulating data of unprecedented quality and quantity on @xmath7 transitions .",
    "one of the long - standing puzzles in baryon spectroscopy has been the low mass of the first positive parity excitation of the nucleon ( the @xmath8 roper resonance ) compared with the lightest odd parity state . without fine tuning of parameters ,",
    "valence quark models tend to leave the mass of the roper too high .",
    "another challenge is presented by the odd parity @xmath6 , whose anomalously small mass has been interpreted as an indication of strong coupled channel effects , and a weak overlap with a three - valence quark state .",
    "while model studies have provided some understanding of the level orderings and mass splittings in the baryons spectrum , it is hoped that lattice qcd @xcite will provide a definitive resolution of some of the outstanding issues .",
    "recently a new approach to nonperturbative @xmath9 fermion action improvement has been developed based on the fat - link irrelevant clover ( flic ) fermion action @xcite .",
    "first results for the spin-1/2 excited nucleon and hyperon , and spin-3/2 @xmath1 and @xmath10 , spectra were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . here",
    "we update the earlier analyses @xcite by including more configurations , and using correlation matrix techniques to better resolve individual excited states of the nucleon and @xmath3 .",
    "following standard procedure , we calculate two - point correlation functions from baryon interpolating fields constructed to maximize overlap with states with specific quantum numbers . in this analysis two interpolating fields are considered . for the positive parity proton",
    "these are given by , @xmath11 where the fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 are evaluated at euclidean space - time point @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are color labels .",
    "as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , because of the dirac structure of the `` diquark '' in the parentheses in eqs .",
    "( [ chi1p ] ) and ( [ chi2p ] ) , one expects correlation functions constructed from @xmath17 to be dominated by larger mass states than those arising from @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17 interpolating field is known to have little overlap with the nucleon ground state @xcite .    for the @xmath3 states , we consider several interpolating fields with different su(3 ) properties .",
    "to test the extent to which su(3 ) flavor symmetry is valid in the baryon spectrum , we construct an interpolating field ( `` @xmath19 '' ) composed of terms common to both the singlet and octet @xmath3 interpolating fields @xcite , @xmath20 and similarly for @xmath21 .",
    "such interpolating fields allow for mixing between singlet and octet states induced by su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking , and may be useful in determining the nature of the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "the simulations are performed on a @xmath22 lattice at @xmath23 , with a lattice spacing of @xmath24  fm , based on a sample of 392 configurations . for the gauge fields ,",
    "a mean - field improved plaquette plus rectangle action is used , while for the quark fields , the flic action @xcite is implemented with @xmath25 sweeps of ape smearing at @xmath26 .",
    "further details of the simulations are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in fig .  1 we show the @xmath28 and @xmath29 masses as a function of @xmath30 for the new simulations with the flic action",
    ". for comparison",
    ", we also show results from earlier simulations with wilson @xcite and domain wall fermions ( dwf ) @xcite , and a nonperturbatively improved clover action @xcite with different source smearing and volumes .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the different improved actions for the nucleon mass .",
    "the wilson results lie systematically low in comparison to these due to large @xmath31 errors in this action @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is repeated for the @xmath29 masses . a mass splitting of around 400",
    "mev is clearly visible between the @xmath28 and @xmath1 for all actions , including the wilson .",
    "the trend of the @xmath29 data with decreasing @xmath32 is also consistent with the mass of the lowest physical negative parity @xmath1 state .",
    "the mass of the @xmath35 state obtained from the @xmath36 interpolating field is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in addition to the flic and wilson results from the present analysis , also shown are the dwf results @xcite , and results from an earlier analysis with wilson fermions together with the operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of the data is the relatively large excitation energy of the @xmath33 , some 1  gev above the nucleon .",
    "it has been speculated that the @xmath36 field may have overlap with the lowest @xmath37 excited state @xcite , however , there is little evidence that this state is the @xmath8 .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath34 interpolating field simply does not have good overlap with either the nucleon or the @xmath8 , but rather a ( combination of ) excited @xmath37 state(s ) .      the spectrum of positive and negative parity @xmath3 states is shown in fig .",
    "the positive ( negative ) parity states labeled @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are constructed from the @xmath44 and @xmath21 interpolating fields , respectively .",
    "the pattern of mass splittings is similar to that observed for the @xmath1 s in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the importance of the correlator matrix analysis ( filled symbols ) is evident from a comparison with the naive results ( open symbols ) , where the states have not been diagonalized .",
    "in particular , using the naive fitting scheme , it is difficult to obtain a mass splitting between @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "once the correlation matrix analysis is performed it is possible to resolve two separate mass states .",
    "there is little evidence that the @xmath42 has any significant overlap with the first positive parity excited state , @xmath45 .",
    "while it seems plausible that nonanalyticities in a chiral extrapolation @xcite of @xmath46 and @xmath47 results could eventually lead to agreement with experiment , the situation for the @xmath6 is not as compelling .",
    "whereas a 150  mev pion - induced self energy is required for the @xmath48 and @xmath40 states , 400  mev is required to approach the empirical mass of the @xmath6 .",
    "this large discrepancy suggests that relevant physics may be absent from simulations in the quenched approximation .",
    "the study of more exotic interpolating fields may indicate the the @xmath6 does not couple strongly to @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "investigations at lighter quark masses involving quenched chiral perturbation theory will assist in resolving these issues .",
