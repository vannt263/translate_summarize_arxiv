    "the exact asymptotic behavior of @xmath104 requires sharp estimates of the jump rates of the process described in figure [ fig9 ] . by symmetry , there are only few different rates . to estimate these rates",
    ", one has to examine the dynamics in which particles slide along the sides of the square .",
    "this process , denoted by @xmath195 in section [ sec2 ] , is a reversible , symmetric markov process on a seven - dimensional graph in which each vertex has degree less than or equal to eight .",
    "such estimates are certainly not easy , but are conceivable . in possession of these estimates",

    "one @xmath216 has been replaced by @xmath3 in the argument due to our incapacity to estimate sharply the hitting probabilities .",
    "the main idea of the article consists in taking a temperature low enough , with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to be allowed to discard all jumps of lower order in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , a square configuration has @xmath217 jumps whose rates are @xmath218 and @xmath219 jumps whose rates are @xmath220 . hence , if @xmath221 vanishes as @xmath55 , a particle which is not at the corner of a square jumps in a time interval @xmath222 $ ] , @xmath145 , with a probability converging to @xmath223 .",
    "if we discard such jumps , from a square the process @xmath73 can only reach a configuration in which a particle at the corner of the square has detached itself from the square . at this point , the detached particle performs a rate one symmetric random walk on @xmath7 until it reaches a side of this square .",
    "while this particle moves , other particles may also jump .",
    "there are a few rate @xmath224 and rate @xmath218 jumps and @xmath225 rate @xmath220 jumps . in order to apply the approach presented here we need to guarantee that the detached particle returns to the square before any another particle moves . we have seen that a particle in the square jumps at rate at most @xmath224 while the detached particle returns to the square in a time of order @xmath226 . hence , the probability that a lower order jump occurs before the detached particle returns should be of order @xmath227 .",
    "we are only able to estimate this probability , in proposition [ s16 ] , by @xmath228 .",
    "thus , as in the previous paragraph , to guarantee that no lower order jump occurs in the time scale in which the center of mass evolves we need to impose that @xmath229 vanishes .",
    "this explains the factor @xmath228 appearing in the error term @xmath230 introduced in .    proceeding in this way",
    ", we face many cases presented in sections [ sec3 ] , [ sec2 ] and [ sec6 ] .",
    "the error term @xmath230 summarizes all the constraints , it represents the bound obtained in proposition [ lc01 ] for the probability that a lower order jump occurs before the process returns to a square configuration when it starts from a square configuration .",
    "this estimate is not sharp and the conditions on the growth of @xmath3 and @xmath2 can certainly be improved .",
    "condition is spurious and comes from the fact that we are not able to estimate correctly the hitting probabilities appearing in .",
    "it can certainly be suppressed , but its removal depends on the estimation of hitting probabilities of a seven dimensional random walk .    finally , note that in theorems [ s10 ] and [ sc01 ] , @xmath2 has to be large , but does not need to increase with @xmath0 .",
