    "recent results of the superkamiokande ( sk ) experiment confirmed the solar neutrino deficit at the level less than data / ssm @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". there are well - known msw , vo , rsfp solutions to the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) that have different signatures which could be observed through day / night ( d / n ) , seasonal and 11 year periodicities of the solar neutrino flux correspondingly .",
    "we study here new aperiodic spin - flavor conversion ( asfc ) scenario@xcite that , on the one hand , is similar with the rsfp scenario because same neutrino transition magnetic moment is assumed while , on the other hand , differs significantly from the rsfp case since the presence of random magnetic fields leads to a large amount of electron antineutrinos produced efficiently _ by a non - resonant way _ within the convective zone of the sun even for small mixing in the cascade conversions @xmath4 .    for the large mixing , @xmath9 , antineutrinos",
    "are produced through last step of such conversions for both scenarios on the way to the earth in the solar wind as well as through usual vacuum neutrino oscillations , @xmath10 , without helicity change .",
    "non - observation of antineutrinos in the sk experiment ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xcite ) puts the bound on neutrino mixing angles in the rsfp like @xmath13 .",
    "we checked this statement from our numerical code using different regular magnetic field profiles @xcite and this bound almost coincides with the limit @xmath14 obtained earlier in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we confirm another result in @xcite that the moderate mixing angle region @xmath15 for which @xmath5 maybe detectable is still acceptable for the rsfp solution to the snp for the lowest allowed strengths of the magnetic field , @xmath16 and for the tipical mass parameter @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we make here accent on much smaller mixing angles , @xmath18 , when the rsfp mechanism fails to produce @xmath5 while our asfc scenario remains very efficient .",
    "moreover , the allowed @xmath1-region occurs quite different for the case of random magnetic fields .    in all four solar neutrino experiments one",
    "measures the integral spectrum , i.e. the number of neutrino events per day for the sk experiment , @xmath19 or the number of neutrino events in snu ( 1 snu = @xmath20 captures per atom / per sec ) in the case of gallex ( sage ) and homestake experiments , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the integral flux of neutrinos of kind `` i '' ( @xmath23 ) assumed to be constant and uniform at a given distance @xmath24 from the center of the sun , @xmath25 is the normalized differential flux , @xmath26 ; @xmath27 are corresponding cross sections ; the thresholds @xmath28 for gallex ( sage ) and homestake are @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspondingly while for sk at present @xmath31   .",
    "the probabilities @xmath32 , where the subscript @xmath33 equals to @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath5 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 correspondingly , satisfy the unitarity condition @xmath41 and   @xmath42  corresponds to averaging over the solar interior if necessary .",
    "there exists , however , a problem with large regular solar magnetic fields , essential for the rsfp scenario .",
    "it is commonly accepted that magnetic fields measured at the surface of the sun are weaker than within interior of the convective zone where this field is supposed to be generated .",
    "the mean field value over the solar disc is about of order @xmath43 and in the solar spots magnetic field strength reaches @xmath44 .",
    "because sunspots are considered to be produced from magnetic tubes transported to the solar surface due to the boyancy , this figure can be considered as a reasonable order - of - magnitude observational estimate for the mean magnetic field strength in the region of magnetic field generation . in the solar magnetohydrodynamics",
    "@xcite one can explain such fields in a self - consistent way if these fields are generated by dynamo mechanism at the bottom of the convective zone ( or , more specific , in the overshoot layer ) .",
    "but its value seems to be too low for effective neutrino conversions .",
    "the mean magnetic field is however followed by a _ small scale _ , random magnetic field .",
    "this random magnetic field is not directly traced by sunspots or other tracers of solar activity .",
    "this field propagates through convective zone and photosphere drastically decreasing in the strength value with an increase of the scale . according to the available understanding of solar dynamo ,",
    "the strength of the random magnetic field inside the convective zone is larger than the mean field strength .",
    "a direct observational estimation of the ratio between this strengthes is not available , however the ratio of order 50  100 does not seem impossible . at least , the ratio between the mean magnetic field strength and the fluctuation at the solar surface is estimated as 50 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is the main reason why we consider here an analogous to the rsfp scenario , an aperiodic spin - flavour conversion ( asfc ) , based on the presence of random magnetic fields in the solar convective zone .",
    "it turns out that the asfc is an additional probable way to describe the solar neutrino deficit in different energy regions , especially if current and future experiments will detect electron antineutrinos from the sun leading to conclusion that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the termin `` aperiodic '' simply reflects the exponential behaviour of conversion probabilities in noisy media ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    as well as for the rsfp mechanism",
    "all arguments for and against the asfc mechanism with random magnetic fields remain the same ones that have been summarized and commented by akhmedov ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the random magnetic field is considered to be maximal somewhere at the bottom of convective zone and decaying to the solar surface . to take into account a possibility , that the solar dynamo action is possible also just below the bottom of the convective zone ( see @xcite )",
    ", we accept , rather arbitrary , that it is distributed at the radial range @xmath45 , i.e. it has the same thickness as the convective zone , while its correlation length is @xmath46 that is close to the mesogranule size .",
    "we suppose also that all the volume of the convective zone is covered by a net of rectangular domains where the random magnetic field strength vector is constant .",
    "the magnetic field strength changes smoothly at the boundaries between the neighbour domains obeying the maxwell equations . since one can not expect the strong influence of small details in the random magnetic field within and near thin boundary layers between the domains this oversimplified model looks applicable .    in agreement with the ssm the neutrino source is supposed to be located inside    = -0.32 cm    -0.58 cm    the solar core with the radius of the order of @xmath47 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we do not consider here the spatial distribution of neutrino emissivity from a unit of a solid angle of the core image and the differences in @xmath48 for different neutrino kinds `` i '' .",
    "different parallel trajectories directed to the earth cross different magnetic domains because the domain size @xmath49 ( in the plane which is perpendicular to neutrino trajectories ) is much less than the transversal size @xmath50 of the full set of parallel rays , @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "the whole number of trajectories ( rays ) with statisticaly independent magnetic fields is about @xmath52 .    at the stage of numerical simulation of the random magnetic field",
    "we generate the set of random numbers with a given r.m.s .",
    "value and for each realization of random magnetic fields along each of @xmath53 rays solve the cauchi problem for the @xmath54 master equation @xcite .",
    "then we calculate the dynamical probabilities @xmath55 , and average them in transversal plane , i.e. obtain the mean arithmetic probabilities as functions of mixing parameters @xmath2 , @xmath56 .",
    "we argue that being additive functions of the area of the convective zone layer ( or , the same , of the number of rays ) these probabilities with increasing area become self - averaged .",
    "to demonstrate the properties of our model we briefly discuss how random magnetic field influences the small - mixing msw solution to snp .",
    "it turns out that for the ssm exponential density profile , typical borone neutrino energies @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , the msw resonance occurs well below the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "thus we can divide the neutrino propagation problem and consider two successive stages .",
    "first , after generation in the middle of the sun , neutrinos propagate in the absence of any magnetic fields , undergo the non - adiabatic ( non - complete ) msw conversion @xmath59 and acquire certain nonzero values @xmath60 end @xmath61 , which can be treated as initial conditions at the bottom of the convective zone . for small neutrino mixing @xmath62 the @xmath63-master equation @xcite",
    "then splits into two pairs of independent equations describing correspondingly the spin - flavor dynamics @xmath64 and @xmath65 in noisy magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , once the msw resonance point is far away from the convective zone , one can also omit @xmath66 and @xmath67 in comparison with @xmath68 . for @xmath69 conversion",
    "this results into a two - component schr@xmath70dinger equation @xmath71 with initial conditions @xmath72 as normalized probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( satisfying the conservation law @xmath75 ) are the only observables , it is convenient to recast eq.([(01 ) ] ) into an equivalent integral form @xmath76\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\cos2\\delta(t_1 - t_2 )   -[b_x(t_1)b_y(t_2 ) - \\nonumber\\\\   & & - b_x(t_2)b_y(t_1)]\\sin2\\delta(t_1 - t_2)\\ } , \\label{(03)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is the third component of the polarization vector @xmath78 .",
    "let us trace the line of further derivation in a spirit of our numerical method .",
    "dividing the interval of integration into a set of equal intervals of correlation length @xmath79 and assuming that possible correlations between @xmath80 and @xmath81 under the integral are small , @xmath82 itself varies very slowly within one correlation cell , and making use of statistical properties of random fields , ( @xmath83 ) different transversal components within one cell are independent random variables , and ( @xmath84 ) magnetic fields in different cells do not correlate , we can average eq.([(03 ) ] ) thus obtaining a finite difference analogue .",
    "returning back to continuous version we get @xmath85~ , \\label{finite}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we retained possible slow space dependence of the r.m.s . magnetic field value .    for @xmath86 and constant   r.m.s .",
    "@xmath87   we obtain the   simple   @xmath88-correlation   result @xcite , @xcite , otherwise there remains an additional stabilizing factor @xmath89 , demonstrating to what extent the vacuum / medium neutrino oscillations within one correlation cell can suppress the spin - flavor dynamics due to the magnetic field only .",
    "another important issue is the problem of temporal dependence of higher statistical moments of @xmath90 as @xmath91 enter the eq.([integ ] ) for the number of events one should be certain that the averaging procedure does not input large statistical errors , otherwise there will be no room for the solar neutrino puzzle itself . for @xmath92 basing on eq .",
    "( [ ( 03 ) ] ) we evaluate the dispersion @xmath93 . here",
    "we present only the final result , the details of derivation will be published elsewhere : @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 .",
    "we see that relative mean square deviation of @xmath60 from its mean value tends with @xmath97 to its maximum asymptotic value @xmath98 irrespectively of the initial value @xmath99    this estimate is true , evidently , only for one neutrino ray .",
    "averaging over @xmath100 independent rays lowers the value ( [ ( c10 ) ] ) in @xmath101 times . that is for our case of @xmath102 rays we get that maximum relative error should not exceed approximately @xmath103 thus justifying the validity of our approach . for smaller magnetic fields",
    "the situation is always better .    to conclude this section , it is neccesary to repeat that the above estimate eq .",
    "( [ ( c10 ) ] ) indicates possible danger when treating numerically the neutrino propagation in noisy media .",
    "indeed , usually adopted one - dimensional ( i.e. along one ray only ) approximation for the @xmath54 master equation @xcite or @xmath104 eq . (",
    "[ ( 01 ) ] ) can suffer from large dispersion errors and one should make certain precautions when averaging these equations over the random noise _ before _ numerical simulations .",
    "otherwise , the resulting error might be even unpredictable .",
    "in order to find the regions in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 plane excluded from nonobservation of @xmath5 in sk it is necessary to compute and plot the isolines of the ratio @xmath105 . indeed ,",
    "as antineutrinos were not detected in the sk experiment one should claim that antineutrino flux is smaller than the sk background @xmath106   @xcite .",
    "deviding this inequality by the ssm borone neutrino flux with energies @xmath107 ,   @xmath108 we find the bound on the averaged over cross - section and spectrum , cascade transition probability @xmath109  , @xmath110 or @xmath111%  . here",
    "^ 2 $ ] is the cross - section of the capture reaction @xmath113 .",
    "notice that the above bound is not valid for low energy region below the threshold of the antineutrino capture by protons , @xmath114 .    for low magnetic fields , @xmath115 , both for regular and random ones we do not find any violation of the bound eq .",
    "( [ percent ] ) .",
    "however , for strong magnetic fields such forbidden parameter regions appear in different areas over @xmath56 and @xmath2 for different kind of magnetic fields ( regular and random ) . in general , the influence of random magnetic fields is more pronounced as compare to the regular ones of the same strength .",
    "it follows that the more intensive the r.m.s .",
    "field @xmath116 in the convective zone the more effective spin - flavour conversions lead to the production of the right - handed @xmath5 , @xmath40-antineutrinos . in the case of small mixing this",
    "is also seen from eq .",
    "( [ finite ] ) .",
    "our results , however , show that there exists strong dependence not only on the r.m.s . magnetic field strength but on its correlation length also .",
    "in particular , when for the same @xmath117 we substitute @xmath118 ( a granule size ) instead of @xmath119 ( a mesogranule size treated in numerical simulation ) the small mixing msw region is fully excluded via the sk bound eq .",
    "( [ percent ] ) ( see fig . 14 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is easily explained due to the maximum value of asfc seen from eq .",
    "( [ finite ] ) ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "vice versa , if the small - mixing msw solution is valid and a large neutrino magnetic moment exists we can extract from neutrino data important constraints on the structure of random magnetic fields deep under surface of the sun .    extrapolating the tendency above either with a decrease of the correlation length @xmath121 or with an increase of the magnetic field values @xmath122 ( or for both changes )",
    "we could also exclude lma msw region or both standard msw regions would be forbidden .",
    "however , for such case one finds low msw with @xmath123 , @xmath124 becomes to be allowed being forbidden for larger correlation lengths ( @xmath125 ) and lower r.m.s .",
    "values ( @xmath126 ) ( see fig . 14 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we develop a model of neutrino spin - flavour conversions in the random magnetic fields of the solar convective zone supposing in consistence with modern mhd models of solar magnetic fields that random fields are naturally much higher than large - scale magnetic fields   created and supported   continuously from the small - scale   random ones @xcite .",
    "it follows that if neutrinos have a large transition magnetic moment their dynamics in the sun is governed by random magnetic fields that , first , lead to _ aperiodic _ and rather _ non - resonant _ neutrino spin - flavor conversions , and second , inevitably lead to production of electron antineutrinos for _ low energy _ or _ large mass difference _ region .",
    "analogous results were obtained in the work @xcite where the averaging of the redfield equation for the @xmath127 density matrix over @xmath88-correlated random magnetic fields allowed to get simple asymptotical solutions for strong random fields and led to the same aperiodic form of the probabilities as in eq.([(c9 ) ] ) .    however , for the realistic case of solar random magnetic fields with a finite correlation length the method of direct numerical simulation of the schroedinger equation given in @xcite is more appropriate .",
    "then the averaging of numerical solutions ( not schroedinger equation ! ) over an ensemble of random field configurations ( see fig . 1 ) gives correct results for this case .",
    "if antineutrinos @xmath5 would be found with the positive signal in the borexino experiment@xcite or , in other words , a small - mixing msw solution to snp fails , this will be a strong argument in favour of magnetic field scenario with asfc in the presence of a large neutrino transition moment , @xmath128 for the same small mixing angle .",
    "we would like to emphasize the importance of future low - energy neutrino experiments ( borexino , hellaz ) which will be sensitive both to check the msw scenario and the @xmath5-production through asfp . as it was shown in a recent work@xcite a different slope of energy spectrum profiles for different scenarios would be a crucial test in favour of the very mechanism providing the solution to snp .",
