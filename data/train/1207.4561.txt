    "one important field is the prediction of soccer matches . in literature",
    "different approaches can be found . in one type of models @xcite appropriate parameters",
    "are introduced to characterize the properties of individual teams such as the offensive strength .",
    "of course , the characterization of team strengths is not only restricted to soccer ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the specific values of these parameters can be obtained via monte - carlo techniques .",
    "these models can then be used for prediction purposes and allow one to calculate probabilities for individual match results .",
    "a key element of these approaches is the poissonian nature of scoring goals @xcite . beyond these goals - based prediction properties",
    "also results - based models are used . here the final result ( home win , draw , away win )",
    "is predicted from comparison of the difference of the team strength parameters with some fixed values @xcite . the quality of both approaches has been compared and no significant differences have been found @xcite . going beyond these approaches",
    "additional covariates can be included .",
    "for example home and away strengths are considered individually or the geographical distance is taken into account @xcite .",
    "recently , also the elo - based ratings have been used for the purpose of forecasting soccer matches @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that statistical models are superior to lay and expert predictions but have less predictive power than the bookmaker odds @xcite .",
    "this observation strongly suggests that either the information , used by the bookmakers , is more powerful or , alternatively , the inference process , based on the same information , is more efficient .",
    "probably , both aspects may play a role .",
    "when predicting soccer matches different key aspects have to be taken into account : ( i ) choice of appropriate observables which contain optimum information about the individual team strengths , ( ii ) definition and subsequent estimation of the team strength , ( iii)estimation of the outcome of a soccer match based on the two team strengths , ( iv ) additional consideration of the stochastic ( poissonian ) contributions to a soccer match .",
    "the final two aspects have been analyzed in detail in ref.@xcite .    in the present work we concentrate on the first two aspects .",
    "therefore we are restricting ourselves to predict the outcome of the second half of the season , i.e. summing over the final 17 matches ( in the german bundesliga ) . to reach this aim",
    "the stochastic aspects are somewhat easier to handle than for the prediction of a single match so that we can concentrate on ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "however , all concepts can be also directly applied to the prediction of single soccer matches .",
    "furthermore , our analysis can naturally be transferred to all other soccer leagues . as a key result",
    "we identify the level of optimum predictability and determine how close our actual inference approaches this optimum level .",
    "it will turn out that the chances for goals are highly informative .",
    "they are provided by a professional sports journal ( www.kicker.de ) since the season 1995/96 . in total",
    "we take into account all seasons until 2010/11 . since the definition of the chances for goals has slightly changed during the first years of the reporting period we have normalized the chances for goals such that their total number is identical in every season .",
    "our general goal is the prediction of the future results of soccer matches .",
    "more specifically , we concentrate on the prediction of the outcome of the second half of the league tournament ( german bundesliga ) .",
    "this second half involves @xmath0 matches .",
    "we want to predict the final goal difference @xmath1 of each team after these @xmath2 match .",
    "a similar analysis could also be performed for points .",
    "we mention in passing that the information content of the goal difference about the team strength is somewhat superior to that of points @xcite .",
    "in previous work we have defined the team strength @xmath3 of a team as the expected average goal difference when playing against all other 17 teams .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath3 could be strictly determined if this team plays very often against the other 17 teams under identical conditions .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the goal difference of some team after @xmath2 matches in the second half , normalized per match .",
    "then @xmath4 can be expressed as the sum of its strength @xmath3 and a random variable @xmath5 , which denotes the non - predictable contributions in the considered matches . in what follows",
    "we assume that the variance of @xmath5 is not correlated to the strength index @xmath3 .",
    "taking into account that the random contributions during different matches are uncorrelated one immediately obtains @xmath6 where @xmath7 describes the variance of the random contribution during a single match and @xmath8 reflects the variance of the distribution of team strengths in the league @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-scaling simply expresses that the statistical effects average out when taking into account a larger number of matches .",
    "this scaling only breaks down for @xmath2 close to unity because then the goal difference also depends on the strength of the opponent . in practice",
    "it turns out that for @xmath10 the difference of the @xmath2 opponents has sufficiently averaged out .",
    "this dependence on the number of considered matches has been explicitly analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the present set of data we obtain @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "actually , @xmath13 is very close to the total number of goals per match ( 2.85 ) .",
    "this expectation is compatible with the assumption of a poissonian process .      in an initial step",
    "we use information from the first half of the season to predict the second half .",
    "the independent variable in the first half is denoted as @xmath14 , the dependent variable in the second half as @xmath15 . as the most simple approach we formulate the linear regression problem @xmath16 . in what follows",
    "all variables fulfill the condition that the first moment of the variable , if averaged over all teams , is strictly zero .",
    "generalization is , of course , straightforward .",
    "the regression problem requires the minimization of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the explicit prediction of @xmath15 . inserting the resulting value of @xmath20 yields for this optimum quadratic variation @xmath21 ^ 2 \\right ] \\ ] ] where @xmath22 )",
    "denotes the variance of the distribution of @xmath15 and    @xmath23    the pearson correlation coefficient between the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this relation has a simple intuitive interpretation .",
    "the higher the correlation between the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 the better the predictability of @xmath15 in terms of @xmath14 .    to be somewhat more general",
    ", we consider the case that exactly @xmath24 matches in the first half of the season have been taken into account to define the independent variable @xmath14 . whenever we want express the dependence on @xmath25 we use the terminology @xmath26 . without this explicit dependence",
    "we always refer to @xmath27 . to reduce the statistical errors we always average over different random selections of @xmath25 matches from the first half of the season .",
    "a natural choice for the variable @xmath14 is the goal difference @xmath28 during the first half .",
    "we always assume that the results have been corrected for the average home advantage in that season .",
    "the quality of the prediction is captured by @xmath29 ; see eq.[chi2 ] . from the empirical data we obtain @xmath30 .    are there other observables @xmath14 which allow one to increase @xmath31 significantly beyond the value of 0.56 ?",
    "the scoring of goals is the final step in a series of match events .",
    "one may thus expect that there exist other match characteristics which are more informative about the team strength .",
    "a possible candidate is the number of chances for goals .",
    "we denote the chances for goals as @xmath32 and the goals as @xmath33 .",
    "the sign indicates whether it refers to the considered team ( + ) or the opponent of that team ( - ) .    in a next step",
    "one can define the goal efficiencies @xmath34 via the relation    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 denotes the probability that the team is able to convert a chance for a goal into a real goal and @xmath37 that the team manages to not concede a goal after a chance for a goal of the opponent . averaging over all teams and seasons one obtains @xmath38 .",
    "in analogy to @xmath39 we will mainly consider the difference @xmath40 for prediction purposes .",
    "if the goal efficiencies strongly vary from team to team in an a priori unknown way the chances for goals contain only very little information about the actual number of goals .",
    "if , however , the goal efficiencies are identical for all teams the chances for goals are more informative than the goals themselves . in appendix",
    "i this general statement is rationalized for a simple model .     as a function of the differences of the chances for goals",
    "@xmath41 ]    in fig.[fig1 ] the actual goal efficiencies @xmath42 after a season are shown together with the respective values of @xmath41 .",
    "naturally , @xmath41 is strongly positively correlated with the team strength .",
    "two effects are prominent . ( 1 ) there is a slight correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath42 . on average better teams",
    "have a slightly better efficiency to score goals .",
    "analogous correlations exist between @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "( 2 ) the goal efficiencies are widely distributed between approx .",
    "15% and 35% .",
    "this observation would indicate that the information content of the chances for goals about the resulting team strength , defined in terms of scoring goals , is quite limited .",
    "surprisingly , this is not true .",
    "for the correlation coefficient @xmath44 one obtains a value of 0.65 which is much larger than @xmath30 .    to understand this high correlation for the chances for goals with the team strength we can discuss the reason for strong fluctuations of @xmath34 between the different teams . in general they are a superposition from two effects : ( i ) true differences between teams and ( ii ) statistical fluctuations , reflecting the random effects in the 34 soccer matches of the season .",
    "both effects can be disentangled if one analyses the @xmath45-dependence of the variance of @xmath34 .",
    "whereas the statistical effects should average out for large @xmath45 the systematic effects remain for all @xmath45 . in analogy to eq.[vg1 ] this can be written as @xmath46        @xmath47 can be interpreted as the true variance of the distribution of @xmath48 void of any random effects .",
    "this n - dependence of @xmath49 is explicitly shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "obviously , one obtains very small values for @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , by far the largest contributions to the scatter of @xmath54 in fig.[fig1 ] is due to random effects . stated differently , beyond the minor correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath41 , shown in fig.[fig1 ] , the efficiency to score a goal out of a chance for a goal is basically the same for all teams !    to better understand the statistical properties of the chances for goals we again disentangle the systematic and random parts by writing @xmath55 one obtains @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "based on this relation it is possible to discuss the individual contributions to the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath58 . using the independence of the random effects in the first and the second half of the season one obtains @xmath59    this expression clearly shows that there are three reasons why the prediction has intrinsic uncertainties , i.e. the correlation coefficient is smaller than unity .",
    "first , the team strength may change in the course of the season , i.e. @xmath60 . since all parameters on the right side are explicitly known ( see above ) we can evaluate eq.[corryz ] , e.g. , for @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the variation of the team strength during a single season is basically absent ; see also ref.@xcite .",
    "second , the estimation of the team strength in the first half of the season is hampered by random effects , as expressed by @xmath63 .",
    "of course , the larger the information content , i.e. the larger @xmath25 , the better the prediction . for the chances for goals",
    "this ratio is given by @xmath64 .",
    "if we had based @xmath14 on @xmath39 rather than @xmath41 we would have obtained a value of 11.1 .",
    "this comparison explicitly reveals why the chances for goals are more informative .",
    "knowledge of the chances for goals of 10 matches is as informative as the goal differences of approx .",
    "21 matches .",
    "third , the prediction of @xmath1 always has intrinsic uncertainties due to the unavoidable random effects in the second half of the season , i.e. @xmath65 .    eq.[corryz ] allows one to define the limit of optimum prediction .",
    "it this case @xmath14 would be explicitly given by @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "this yields @xmath68 .",
    "this shows that the improvement of taking the chances for goals ( @xmath69 ) rather than the goals ( @xmath70 ) indeed is a major improvement relative to this optimum limit .",
    "naturally , the prediction quality can be further improved by incorporating information from the previous season about the team strength .",
    "this additional variable is denoted as @xmath71 .",
    "here we consider the chances for goals of the previous season which we denote @xmath72 .",
    "one obtains @xmath73 . in principle one",
    "can again analyse the systematic and random contributions of @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath75-dependent variance reads ( see eq.[vc1 ] )    @xmath76    with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for reasons of comparison",
    "all relevant statistical parameters are summarized in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .",
    "the different systematic and random contributions of the observables , relevant for this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     of course , both values are close to @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the small differences expresses the fact that the statistical properties of the first and the second half of the season are slightly different @xcite . using the same reasoning as in the context of eq.[corryz ] one finally obtains @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "both values are identical within statistical errors .",
    "this is compatible with the observation that the team strength does not vary within a season .",
    "the fact that both values are significantly smaller than unity shows , however , that there is a small but significant variation of the team strength between two seasons . for future purposes we use the average value of @xmath83 for the characterization of the correlation of the team strength between two seasons .",
    "for small @xmath25 , i.e. at the beginning of the season , the information content about the strength of a team is quite limited .",
    "therefore it is essential to incorporate also team information which is already available at the beginning of the tournament , i.e. reflects the strength of this team from the past season .",
    "thus , before the first match the prediction is fully based on @xmath71 and gradually with an increasing number of matches the variable @xmath14 contains more and more information about the present team strength and thus will gain a stronger statistical weight in the inference process .",
    "this setup is sketched in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "as discussed above we choose for @xmath71 the chances for goals of the previous season .",
    "the general relations , however , also hold beyond this specific choice .",
    "interestingly , the quality of the multivariate prediction can be expressed in analogy to eq.[chi2 ] and reads @xmath84 ^ 2 \\right ] \\ ] ] where the partial correlation coefficient @xmath85 has been used .",
    "@xmath86 has been already defined in eq.[chi2 ] .",
    "the second factor on the right - hand side of eq.[chi2new ] explicitly contains the additional information of the variable @xmath71 as compared to @xmath14 .",
    "one can easily show that in agreement with expectation eq.[chi2new ] is completely symmetric in @xmath71 and @xmath14 .",
    "since eq.[chi2new ] is non - standard it is explicitly derived in the appendix ii via some general arguments .",
    "so far , we have identified @xmath15 with the goal difference in the second half of the season which is composed of @xmath3 and the non - predictable random effects as expressed by @xmath87 .",
    "now we define @xmath88    , is shown as a function of the number of match days @xmath25 .",
    "different choices of variables are shown .",
    "the solid lines are based on the explicit formulas for the prediction quality . ]",
    "this can be interpreted as the statistical error for the prediction of the individual team strengths . in case of a perfect estimation of the team strengths",
    "one would have @xmath89 .",
    "mathematically this result can be derived by choosing @xmath90 rather than @xmath91 in eq.[chi2new ] . after employing some straightforward algebraic manipulations of eq.[chi2new ]",
    "one directly obtains @xmath92 .",
    "for each value of @xmath25 we have performed a multivariate regression analysis , yielding @xmath93 , and finally subtracted @xmath94 . as before we have chosen several subsets of @xmath25 matches from the first half of the season to decrease the statistical error .",
    "now we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we neglect the contribution of @xmath71 , i.e. the information from the previous season .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "one can see that ( trivially ) for @xmath95 the standard deviation in the estimation of the team strength is identical to the standard deviation of the @xmath3-distribution .",
    "the longer the season , the more information is available to distinguish between stronger and weaker teams . using the information of the complete first half of the season ( @xmath61 ) the statistical uncertainty decreases to 0.22 . here",
    "one can explicitly see the advantage of using the chances for goals rather than the goals themselves .",
    "repeating the same analysis with the number of goals one would have an uncertainty of 0.30 after @xmath61 matches which is significantly higher than the value of 0.22 , reported above .",
    "second , when additionally incorporating the information from @xmath71 , the statistical uncertainty is already quite small at the beginning of the season ( 0.3 ) .",
    "of course , during the course of the season it becomes even smaller . even after 17 matches",
    "the additional gain of using @xmath71 is significant ( 0.22 vs. 0.19 ) .",
    "@xmath92 can be also calculated analytically by incorporating the statistical properties of the variables @xmath96 , and @xmath15 . for future purposes we abbreviate @xmath97 .",
    "first , we have ( using ( @xmath98 )    @xmath99    furthermore , we express @xmath100 as @xmath101    in analogy one obtains @xmath102    in summary , all information is contained in the two constants @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields @xmath105 . finally , one ends up with @xmath106    now we can compare the actual uncertainty , as already shown in fig.[fig4 ] , with the theoretical expectation , as expressed by the analytical result eq.[chitheo ] . the results are included in fig.[fig4 ] . to reproduce the case without the variable @xmath71 one can simply choose @xmath107",
    "one can see a very close agreement with the actual data .",
    "is this good agreement to be expected ? actually , our analysis just contains two approximations .",
    "first , we have chosen @xmath108 which , indeed , holds very well ( see above ) .",
    "second , we have assumed that the team strength does not vary during the first half of the season .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite the team strength fluctuates with a small amplitude of approx . @xmath109 and with a decorrelation time of approx .",
    "7 matches .",
    "since we average over different choices of @xmath25 matches and , furthermore , restrict ourselves to the prediction of the total second half , these temporal fluctuation are to a large extent averaged out .",
    "the main goal was ( i ) to analyse the information content of different observables and ( ii ) to better understand the limits of the prediction of soccer matches .",
    "the prediction quality could be grasped by the two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "one can easily see that the theoretical expression for the prediction quality eq.[chitheo ] approaches the limit of perfect prediction in two limits ( i ) for @xmath110 and @xmath111 the information from either the previous or from the present season , respectively , perfectly reflects the present team strength .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath112 all random effects have averaged out so that only the systematic effects remain .    this result can be easily generalized .",
    "for example one can show for the german bundesliga that the market value , determined before the season , is highly informative for the expected outcome .",
    "taking an appropriately chosen linear combination of different observables one may slightly increase the value of @xmath103 but keeping the general structure of eq.[chitheo ] identical .",
    "the same analysis could have been also performed by predicting points rather than goal differences .",
    "both observables are linearly correlated via the simple relation @xmath113 . in analogy",
    "to @xmath3 the value of @xmath114 denotes the expected number of points which a team gains in a match against an average team of the league in a neutral stadium .",
    "thus , an average team ( @xmath115 ) on average gains 23 points per half - season .    ) .",
    "different choices of variables are shown .",
    "furthermore , the limit of perfect predictability is indicated . ]",
    "one interesting question arises : is the residual statistical error of @xmath3 for @xmath61 small or large ?",
    "this question may be discussed in two different scenarios .",
    "first , one may want to predict the outcome of the second half of the league . in the present context",
    "the uncertainty is given by @xmath116 .",
    "these values are plotted for different prediction scenarios in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "one can see how the additional information decreases the uncertainty of the prediction .",
    "most importantly , the _ no man s land _ below an uncertainty of @xmath117 can not be reached by any type of prediction .",
    "the art of approaching this perfect prediction thus resorts to decrease the present value of 7.8 to a value closer to 7.1 .",
    "second , one may be interested in the prediction of a single match .",
    "this case is somewhat different .",
    "since the team fluctuations are very difficult to predict the fluctuation amplitude @xmath109 @xcite serves as a scale for estimating the quality of prediction . if the uncertainty is much smaller than @xmath118 any further improvement would not help . in the present case",
    "the statistical error is close to @xmath118 so that a further reduction of @xmath92 would still be relevant for prediction purposes .",
    "note that the chances for goals are not completely objective observable because finally also the subjective judgement of a sports journalist may influence its estimates . in this sense",
    "the high information content of chances for goals indicates that the subjective component is quite small and the general definition is very reasonable .",
    "of course , in the future one may look for strictly objective match observables taken by companies such as opta and impire to further improve the information content .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with d. riedl , b. strauss , and j. smiatek .",
    "here we consider a simple example of a fictive coin - tossing tournament where the head appears with probability @xmath119 which in this simple example is given by 1/2 . a team is allowed to toss the coin @xmath120 times per round . in the first round this results in @xmath121 times tossing the head .",
    "thus , in the first round one has observed the number of tosses @xmath120 as well as the number of heads @xmath121 . in the relation to soccer",
    "@xmath120 would correspond to the number of chances for goals and @xmath122 to the number of goals in that match . in order to keep the argument simple",
    "we assume that @xmath120 is a constant whereas in a real soccer match @xmath120 can naturally vary . how to predict the expected number of goals @xmath123 in the next round ? here we consider two different approaches .",
    "( 1 ) the prediction is based on the achievement of the first round , i.e. on the value of @xmath122 .",
    "then the best prediction is @xmath124 .",
    "the variance of the statistical error of the prediction can be simply written as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the binomial distribution . a straightforward calculation yields for this variance a value of @xmath127 .",
    "( 2 ) the prediction is based on the knowledge of tossing attempts .",
    "the optimum prediction is , of course , @xmath128 .",
    "the variance of the statistical error is given by the binomial distribution , i.e. by @xmath129 .",
    "stated differently , knowing the number of attempts to reach a specific goal ( here tossing a head ) is more informative that the actual number of successful outcomes as long as the probability @xmath119 is well known .",
    "here we show a simple derivation of the chosen form of @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath130 denote the solution of the regression problem @xmath131 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath132 is the solution of the regression problem @xmath133 . in a next step one defines the new variables @xmath134 and @xmath135 . for these new variables",
    "the correlation with @xmath14 is explicitly taken out .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath136 is exactly given by the partial correlation coefficient @xmath137 .",
    "now we consider the regression problem of interest @xmath138 . in a first step",
    "it is formally rewritten as @xmath139 using the above notation and introducing the new regression parameter @xmath140 we abbreviate this relation via @xmath141 by construction the observable @xmath14 is uncorrelated to @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    ". therefore the independent variable @xmath14 does not play any role for the prediction of @xmath143 so that effectively one just has a single - variable regression problem",
    ". therefore one can immediately write @xmath144 ^ 2\\right].\\ ] ] the first factor is identical to @xmath86 whereas the pearson correlation coefficient in the second factor is identical to @xmath137 .",
    "this concludes the derivation of @xmath93 ."
