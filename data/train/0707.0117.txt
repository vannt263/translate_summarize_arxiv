    "the difficulty in performing quantum mechanical calculations of multi - dimensional systems has stimulated an intensive and ongoing effort in the last three decades to develop numerical tools based on semiclassical mechanics . in this context",
    ", we refer to semiclassical mechanics as the derivation of a quantum mechanical wavefunction or propagator via propagation of classical ( or classical - like ) trajectories . from a physical point of view",
    ", semiclassical methods try to evade the non - locality imbedded in quantum mechanics .",
    "mathematically speaking , semiclassical methods aim at casting the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which is a pde , in terms of odes related to classical equations of motion .",
    "this transformation has significant computational advantages that can ease the inherent difficulty of multi - dimensional quantum calculations .",
    "the wkb method@xcite can be considered as the first of the semiclassical methods .",
    "its date of birth almost coincides with the publication of the schrdinger equation in 1926 , and virtually every standard text book in quantum mechanics has a description of the method .",
    "the basic idea of the wkb method is to recast the wavefunction as the exponential of a function and then replace the exponent with a power series in @xmath1 .",
    "the wkb method is ordinarily applied to the _ time - independent _ schrdinger equation and provides for a good approximation to the eigenstates as long as one is not too near a classical turning point .",
    "it is only natural that as part of the effort to develop time - dependent semiclassical methods , a time - dependent version of the wkb method would be explored .",
    "surprisingly little work has been done in this direction@xcite .",
    "a decade ago , boiron and lombardi@xcite developed a complex trajectory version of time - dependent wkb ( tdwkb ) , which we refer to as ctdwkb .",
    "in conventional wkb the leading order term in the phase of the wave function is taken to be @xmath2 and the leading order term in the amplitude is taken to be @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the ctdwkb formulation treats the amplitude and phase on an equal footing .",
    "the price to pay for this procedure is that the resulting classical trajectories propagate in the complex plane .",
    "the benefits are that the results are superior to standard tdwkb and no singularities are encountered during the integration of the equation of motion .",
    "the ctdwkb equations of motion can be solved analytically and yield the _ exact _ wavefunction for an initial gaussian wavepacket in a potential with up to quadratic terms .",
    "the first - order method was tested numerically by boiron and lombardi for scattering of a gaussian wavepacket from a potential barrier .",
    "they showed that the method produced very good results as long as the wavefunction did not exhibit _ interference effects _ in the form of oscillations or nodes@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a simple modification to ctdwkb that provides an accurate description of oscillations in the wavefunction .",
    "we show that complex classical trajectories , similar to real classical trajectories , can cross in configuration space . by superposing the contributions from two or more crossing trajectories ,",
    "interference effects are obtained .",
    "we take ctdwkb a step further in another direction by showing that the approximation generally improves when incorporating additional terms in the series expansion .",
    "since the wkb expansion is an asymptotic series , this observation is non - trivial .",
    "two other semiclassical formulations that incorporate complex trajectories should be mentioned in relation with ctdwkb .",
    "the first is the generalized gaussian wavepacket dynamics ( ggwpd ) developed by huber , heller and littlejohn @xcite .",
    "one may show that for an initial gaussian wavepacket the equations of motion of ggwpd are de facto identical to the equations of the first - order approximation of ctdwkb .",
    "however the ggwpd has no generalization to arbitrary initial wavefunctions and no systematic way to increase the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "on the other hand , in reference @xcite , huber and heller appreciate the importance of multiple complex trajectories in obtaining interference phenomena . here",
    "we incorporate the idea of crossing complex trajectories into the more general ctdwkb formulation .",
    "the second formulation that is closely related to ctdwkb is bohmian mechanics with complex action ( bomca)@xcite . ctdwkb and bomca begin with the same ansatz of substituting of an exponential function @xmath4 $ ] into the tdse .",
    "similar to ctdwkb , the bomca formulation incorporates equations of motion that propagate along complex trajectories .",
    "the first - order equations of motion of bomca are identical to the equations of first - order ctdwkb .",
    "the differences between the two formulations are : ( 1 ) the equations of motion in bomca are for the coefficients of spatial derivatives of the phase . in ctdwkb the equations of motion are for the coefficients of an @xmath1 taylor expansion of the phase and their spatial derivatives .",
    "( 2 ) incorporating higher order terms of the ctdwkb approximation does not effect the the results for lower order terms since each equation of motion depends only on lower terms of the expansion .",
    "this is not the case with bomca where each equation of motion depends on both lower and higher terms resulting in a backward feedback .",
    "( 3 ) a result of the last difference is that in ctdwkb the equations of motion of the trajectories remain _ classical _ whereas in bomca , the inclusion of higher orders of the approximation affect the complex trajectories by adding a  quantum force \" that yields _ quantum _ trajectories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ formulation ] we formulate tdwkb and the ctdwkb .",
    "our derivation is more compact than the boiron - lombardi derivation and demonstrates how to obtain the equations of motion for higher orders of the expansion in a simple manner . in section [ num ]",
    "we apply the formulation to a gaussian initial wavepacket propagating in a quartic double - well potential .",
    "we demonstrate that superimposing the contributions of crossing trajectories leads to interference effects and that incorporating higher order terms in the expansion improves the approximation .",
    "section [ summary ] is a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "following boiron and lombardi we will refer to the ctdwkb method in the body of the paper as the complex trajectory method ( ctm ) for short .",
    "for simplicity we present the one - dimensional version of the ctm derivation . the generalization to",
    "multi - dimensions can be performed in a straightforward manner .",
    "the conventional wkb derivation begins by inserting the ansatz @xmath5,\\ ] ] into the _ time - independent _ schrdinger equation , where @xmath1 is planck s constant divided by @xmath6 .",
    "the end result is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the particle , @xmath9 is the potential energy and @xmath10 is the eigenvalue . if we assume that @xmath11 can be expanded asymptotically as a polynomial in @xmath1 @xmath12 then , by substituting the last equation into eq.([dsdx ] ) and equating powers of @xmath1 , a series of coupled odes are obtained for the @xmath13 s .",
    "the time - dependent wkb begins by inserting the ansatz@xcite @xmath14,\\ ] ] into the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath15 the result is the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation@xcite @xmath16 where the lhs of the equation is in the form of the classical hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "equation ( [ st1 ] ) is formally exact since no approximation has been introduced . in tdwkb formulation",
    "we insert into eq.([st1 ] ) a time - dependent version of eq.([expansion1 ] ) @xmath17 the result is @xmath18 by equating terms having the same powers of @xmath1 we obtain the classical hamilton - jacobi equation for @xmath19 @xmath20 and equations of motion for @xmath21 @xmath22 conveniently , each equation depends only on lower order terms . the next step in tdwkb is to convert eqs.([st2 ] ) and ( [ st3 ] ) into a set of odes by looking at the evolution of @xmath23 along classical trajectories , as described in the next section .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the first term in the @xmath1 power expansion , @xmath24 , obeys the hamilton - jacobi equation ( eq.([st2 ] ) ) .",
    "this equation is an alternative formulation of newton s second law of motion in terms of an action field .",
    "the emergence of classical trajectories in the tdwkb equations provides the incentive to solve eqs.([st2 ] ) and ( [ st3 ] ) by integrating along such trajectories .",
    "the link between the hamilton - jacobi equation and classical trajectories is demonstrated by defining the _ velocity field _ @xmath25 and considering the trajectories defined by @xmath26 by taking the spatial partial derivative of eq.([st2 ] ) , using the definition of the lagrangian time derivative @xmath27 , and applying eq.([def1 ] ) we obtain the equation of motion for the velocity along a trajectory as newton s second law @xmath28 hence , the trajectories defined are simply classical trajectories .    inserting eq.([st2 ] ) in the lagrangian time derivative of @xmath24 yields @xmath29 where we recognize the equation of motion for the action along a classical trajectory . noting that @xmath30 is a mere dummy variable , we summarize the equations of motion for the zeroth order term of tdwkb , @xmath24 @xmath31 we turn to the higher order terms in the series @xmath32 , @xmath33 . recognizing the lhs of eqs.([st3 ] ) as the lagrangian time derivative of @xmath32 , we can write @xmath34 these equations do not constitute a closed set of odes since they depend on partial derivatives such as @xmath35 .",
    "we close the set of equations by deriving equations of motion for the partial derivatives on the rhs of eq.([st4 ] ) ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the process by deriving equations of motion for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . inserting @xmath41 in eq.([st4 ] )",
    "yields @xmath42 an equation of motion for @xmath43 is obtained by taking a second spatial partial derivative of eq.([st2 ] ) , @xmath44+\\partial_{xx}v=0,\\ ] ] and rewriting it as @xmath45 this equation is derived in reference @xcite by a cumbersome finite difference scheme .",
    "it is equivalent to eq.(2.9d ) of reference @xcite where the equation appears in the context of ggwpd .",
    "note that an equation of motion for any order of spatial derivatives of @xmath24 can be derived in a similar fashion by taking consecutive spatial derivatives of eq.([dtdsxx ] ) and then grouping the lagrangian time derivative terms .",
    "equations ( [ dtds1 ] ) and ( [ dtds0xx ] ) provide a closed set of equations of motion for @xmath39 .    inserting @xmath46 into eq.([st4 ] )",
    "yields @xmath47 the equations of motion for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained by first inserting @xmath41 in eq.([st3 ] ) .",
    "we then derive two equations by taking a first and a second spatial partial derivative of the result . by grouping the lagrangian time derivatives of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in each of the two equations",
    "separately we obtain @xmath50 the last equations depend in turn on @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the equation of motion for these terms can be obtained by additional spatial derivatives of eq.([dtdsxx ] ) , a process that yields @xmath53-\\partial_{xxxx}v.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ dtds0xx ] ) and ( [ dtds2])-([st52 ] ) provide a closed set of equations of motion for @xmath40 .",
    "the scheme we described for @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be extended to any of the higher order terms in the expansion .",
    "note that incorporating higher order terms @xmath32 in the tdwkb approximation does not affect the classical trajectories associated with @xmath24 , defined by eqs.([set_s0 ] ) and ( [ set_s01 ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the source of the distinction between conventional tdwkb and ctm .      in conventional tdwkb the initial wavefunction is  divided \" between @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56=\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}s_{0}(x,0)+s_{1}(x,0)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the initial amplitude and phase respectively , both taken to be real .",
    "the phase is related to the zero - order term @xmath24 and the amplitude to the first - order correction term @xmath39 according to @xmath59,\\ ] ] and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "note that the initial conditions specified by eqs.([last ] ) yield classical trajectories that propagate on the _ real _ axis since @xmath24 and its spatial derivatives are real quantities ( see eqs.([set_s0 ] ) and ( [ set_s01 ] ) ) .",
    "in contrast , in ctm the amplitude and phase are treated on an equal footing with far - reaching consequences .",
    "the initial wavefunction is specified by @xmath54 @xmath62 , \\",
    "s_{n}(x,0)=0 , \\ n\\geq1.\\ ] ] since @xmath24 is generally complex and since the initial velocity @xmath63 , the trajectories propagate in the _ complex plane _ even if the initial positions are on the real axis ( @xmath64=0 $ ] ) .",
    "this observation requires us to look at the analytic continuation of the wavefunction in the complex plane and find ways to extract the wavefunction on the real axis .",
    "one of the benefits of conventional tdwkb and ctm compared with bomca , is that the trajectories obey the classical equations of motion and are independent of the order of the phase expansion we incorporate in the final wavefunction .",
    "but the fact still remains that for an arbitrary initial position @xmath65 and an arbitrary final propagation time @xmath66 the final position @xmath67 is complex and yields an  analytically continued \" wavefunction at @xmath67 @xmath68\\approx\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\sum_{j=0}^{n}\\hbar^{j}s_{j}[x(t_{f}),t_{f}]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the non - negative integer @xmath69 is the order of the approximation .",
    "references @xcite include discussions of root search algorithms for the derivation of initial positions that reach the _ real _ axis at a given time .",
    "we will not describe all the details here but will just state the central idea .",
    "the complex root search exploits the assumption that the mapping @xmath70 is analytic .",
    "this property allows for an iterative process that detects the initial positions that correspond to real final positions .",
    "as demonstrated in references @xcite and in section [ frt_ord ] , for an arbitrary potential and final time , the mapping is only _ locally _ analytic .",
    "generally , more than one initial position ends at a final position ( whether real or complex ) .",
    "this makes the search for trajectories that end on the real axis more complicated but it has an important advantage in terms of interference effects .",
    "our main observation is that the contribution of multiple trajectories in ctm can accumulate to an interference pattern . for simplicity",
    "we make the following assumption .",
    "suppose that @xmath71 trajectories end at final time @xmath66 on real position @xmath67 then the final wavefunction is approximated by a superposition of contributions @xmath72\\approx\\sum_{l=1}^{l}\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}s^{l}\\left[x(t_{f}),t_{f}\\right]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where each trajectory ( denoted by the index @xmath73 ) is associated with a phase @xmath74 $ ] @xmath75=\\sum_{j=0}^{n}\\hbar^{j}s_{j}^{l}[x(t_{f}),t_{f}],\\ ] ] that is calculated by the ctm equations of motion . in section [ num ] we show that this assumption is too simplified and does not hold at all times and all positions .",
    "for example , for positions associated with a tunneling part of the wavefunction , only one of the multiple trajectories should be taken into account . a partial discussion on the superposition of contributions from complex trajectories appears in reference @xcite in the ggwpd context . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we will explain an alternative derivation of the ctm in which the need to include multiple trajectories for certain times and positions becomes apparent",
    "in this section we examine numerically the ctm formulation allowing for the superposition of complex trajectories . for ready comparison the physical system we choose is identical to the one studied by boiron and lombardi ( reference @xcite section ivb ) .",
    "the potential considered is a quartic double - well @xmath76 the initial wavefunction is a gaussian wavepacket @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and we take @xmath82 ( all quantities are given in atomic units ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the terms in the @xmath1 power - expansion of the phase are @xmath83 where @xmath84 .    in section [ frt_ord ]",
    "we analyze the first order approximation of ctm ( @xmath85 ) and the properties of the trajectories .",
    "section [ sec_ord ] is dedicated to the next order of the approximation ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we omit an analysis of @xmath87 since it is well presented in reference @xcite and only yields poor results .",
    "the first order approximation of ctm requires the solution of eqs.([set_s0 ] ) , ( [ set_s01 ] ) , ( [ set_s02 ] ) , ( [ dtds1 ] ) and ( [ dtds0xx ] ) .",
    "the first two equations define the complex classical trajectories and the next three equations yield @xmath24 and @xmath39 .",
    "we start by analyzing the complex classical trajectories . as mentioned above , the mapping @xmath89 is not one - to - one .",
    "for the quartic potential , we found that three initial positions are mapped to every real final position at @xmath90 . for short time",
    "scales this observation can be supported analytically . for general potentials or for longer time scales than we present here , more than three initial positions might lead to the same final position@xcite . in figures [ tra](a ) and",
    "[ tra](b ) we plot complex classical trajectories for @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "the _ initial positions _ of the trajectories can be divided into three groups referred to as _ _ branches__@xcite .",
    "one group of the initial positions is called the real branch and the other groups are called the secondary branches .",
    "the real branch is characterized by the property that it includes the initial position of a trajectory that propagates _",
    "solely _ on the real axis .",
    "we refer to this trajectory as the real trajectory .",
    "it can be readily verified that for a gaussian initial wavefunction there is only a single real trajectory that initiates at @xmath93 ( see eqs.([set_s01 ] ) , eq.([set_s0 ] ) and ( [ moment0 ] ) ) . in fig.[tra](b ) we depict the real trajectory explicitly .",
    "the secondary branches are defined simply as the groups of initial positions that do not belong to the real branch .",
    "generally , the branches might be infinitely long curves in the complex plane .",
    "we will use the term branches to refer to the locus of _ initial _ positions that leads to final positions where the wavefunction is significantly different from zero .",
    "hence , the branches are curves of _ finite _ length in the complex plane , although clearly there is some arbitrariness to their length .    in fig.[tra](a ) we see that at short time scales the secondary branches are centered far from neighborhood of the real axis .",
    "we can show analytically that for small times @xmath94 the initial positions that comprise the real branch obey @xmath95 whereas the secondary branches obey @xmath96 .",
    "note that the linear dependence of the initial momentum on position ( eq.([moment0 ] ) ) allows trajectories with initial positions far from the real axis to reach a real final position in a short time .",
    "unlike the secondary branches , the real branch is centered in the vicinity of the real axis at all times .",
    "the initial position @xmath93 is a fixed point of the real branch and prevents the real branch ( recall that this is the locus of _ initial _ positions ) from  straying \" from the neighborhood of the real axis as the final time @xmath94 is increased . at intermediate times",
    "( time scales comparable to the time of the collision of the wavefunction with the barrier , @xmath97 ) secondary branch ( 1 ) reaches the vicinity of the real axis ( fig.[tra](b ) ) and at longer time scales it continues in the direction of the positive imaginary axis . as we demonstrate below , the proximity of secondary branch ( 1 ) to the real axis is closely related to the size of its contribution to the final form of the wavefunction and its role in interference effects .",
    "secondary branch ( 2 ) does not reach the vicinity of the real axis for any of the time scales specified below .",
    "the contribution of this branch to the absolute value of the final wavefunction ( eq.([sup ] ) ) is negligible ( in the order of @xmath98 ) .",
    "hence , from here on we ignore secondary branch ( 2 ) and refer to secondary branch ( 1 ) as _ the _ secondary branch .",
    "= 9 cm = 9 cm    as we mentioned in section [ super ] , the existence of more than one branch motivates the attempt to superpose the contributions of the real branch and secondary branch in the final wavefunction @xmath99=\\psi_{\\textrm{r}}+\\psi_{\\textrm{s } } ; \\ \\ \\ \\psi_{\\textrm{r}}=\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}s_{\\textrm{real}}\\right ] , \\",

    "the figures indicate that when the wavefunction does not exhibit oscillations , the contribution of the real branch is sufficient to obtain a good approximation to the wavefunction .",
    "but at intermediate times , when the wavefunction exhibits interference effects , the contribution of both branches must be included .",
    "this last last observation applies in the spatial range up to the classical turning point ( @xmath104 ) , beyond which the combined contribution diverges from the exact result .",
    "we turn to a closer inspection of this divergence . in fig.[prop6_1 ] we plot the contribution at @xmath92 of each individual branch and their superposition .",
    "starting from the vicinity of @xmath105 , we observe an exponential increase of @xmath103 .",

    "<S> we present a significant improvement to a time - dependent wkb ( tdwkb ) formulation developed by boiron and lombardi [ jcp * 108 * , 3431 ( 1998 ) ] in which the tdwkb equations are solved along classical trajectories that propagate in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> boiron and lombardi showed that the method gives very good agreement with the exact quantum mechanical result as long as the wavefunction does not exhibit interference effects such as oscillations and nodes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that this limitation can be overcome by superposing the contributions of _ crossing _ trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the approximation improves when incorporating higher order terms in the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> these improvements could make the tdwkb formulation a competitive alternative to current time - dependent semiclassical methods .    </S>",
