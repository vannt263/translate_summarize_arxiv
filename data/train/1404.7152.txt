    "the ability to geospatially index a large volume of twitter data is valuable for several emerging research directions . indeed",
    ", geographic social media analytics have proven useful for understanding regional flu trends @xcite , linguistic patterns @xcite , election forecasting @xcite , social unrest @xcite , and disaster response @xcite . these approaches",
    ", however , depend on the physical locations of twitter users which are only sparsely available in public data .",
    "interestingly , recent work from the computational social sciences community has established that online social ties are often formed over short geographic distances @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "because of this , it is possible to approximate the location of a twitter user by examining publicly - known locations of their online friends @xcite @xcite .",
    "using social network analysis to solve geolocation problems relies only on public twitter metadata , which , somewhat counterintuitively , provides several advantages over content - based approaches .",
    "network - based geotagging sidesteps difficulties with foreign natural language processing , ignores noisy twitter text , and makes it possible to demonstrate results at previously unreachable scales .",
    "the largest and most accurate geolocation results currently published have utilized social network analysis @xcite @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we solve network - based geotagging problems from an optimization viewpoint . unlike existing methods which have independently developed node - wise heuristics",
    ", we show that a globally - defined and highly - studied convex optimization can be solved for location inference . to be precise",
    ", we infer user location by solving @xmath3 where @xmath4 encodes a location estimate for each user , @xmath5 denotes the set of users who opt to make their locations , @xmath6 , public , the total variation on the twitter social network is defined by @xmath7 measures geodesic distance via vincenty s formulae , and the edge weights , @xmath8 , are equal to the minimal number of reciprocated @mentions between users @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    in other words , *",
    "we seek a network such that the weighted sum over all geographic distances between connected users is as small as possible*. this sum , defined in ( [ eq : tvdef ] ) and known in the literature as total variation , has demonstrated superior performance as an optimization heuristic for several information inference problems across a wide variety of fields .",
    "the minimization in ( [ eq : tvopt ] ) leads to a network where connected communities of users are placed into the same city .",
    "motivation for this heuristic relies on communicative locality in twitter which has been demonstrated in previous research @xcite @xcite @xcite and is further justified by our experiments in section [ sec : grnd ] .",
    "evidence of communicative locality in other online social networks can be found in @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the social media geotagging problem is relatively new ; total variation minimization , however , is not .",
    "originally introduced to the computational sciences as a heuristic for image denoising @xcite , literature on total variation minimization is now truly vast  thousands of papers spanning several decades .",
    "while most of this research has been confined to imaging processing , recent work has shown that total variation is valuable to several newer applications , such as crime modelling @xcite , graphics @xcite , and `` community detection '' @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that use of total variation for general transductive learning tasks outperforms state - of - the - art methods on standard benchmark datasets @xcite @xcite .",
    "the present work is the first to demonstrate a theory link between the social media geotagging problem and total variation minimization .",
    "there are real and immediate practical applications for our results . from a business perspective",
    ", the importance of twitter geotagging has recently warranted several commercial offerings .",
    "at least one product is based on alignments between self - reported profile locations and the geonames database .",
    "our experiments in section [ sec : coverage ] demonstrate that , even if all nonempty profile locations could be mapped to unambiguous locations , the coverage of profile - based geotagging could reach at most @xmath11 of tweet volume .",
    "when nonsensical or ambiguous profile locations are ignored , our experiments show that the coverage of profile - based geotagging drops below @xmath12 .    a salient feature of our approach",
    ", however , is that we are unable to estimate within - city motion for individual twitter users .",
    "our goal is high - volume static location inference with city - level accuracy .",
    "this may be tolerable for several applications as research has indicated that users typically remain within a small radius ; cf .",
    "section [ sec : motion ] and @xcite .",
    "since it is still unclear if better - than - city - level accuracy is possible at scale , we restrict our training sets to users who tweet primarily within the same radius , using their median location as `` home '' using social networks to infer location makes sense only if a user s friends are primarily located within the same geographic region .",
    "we show that the geographic dispersion of each user s ego network , @xmath13 agrees well with geotag error and therefore provides us with a per - user confidence measure .",
    "overall error can thus be controlled by limiting @xmath14 .",
    "our experiments show that coverage remains high even when restrictions on @xmath14 are tight .",
    "solutions to the geotagging problem are most interesting when demonstrated at scale .",
    "we exhibit our method on a network of @xmath15 twitter users with @xmath16 connections between them and infer locations for @xmath0 users .",
    "this is made possible by the optimization algorithm we employ to solve ( [ eq : tvopt ] ) , parallel coordinate descent @xcite , which we have implemented in a distributed manner using the apache spark cluster computing framework @xcite .    to be clear ,",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows :    * we show that the social network geotagging problem can be solved via a globally - defined convex optimization * we develop a novel per - user accuracy estimate * we demonstrate our results at scale ; producing the largest database of twitter user locations currently known in the literature",
    "location inference in social media has caught the attention of several researchers from both academia and industry .",
    "two major classes of solutions to the geotagging problem are now prevalent : language - based , and network - based .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite provided methods based on identifying and searching for location - specific terms in twitter text .",
    "more recent work by @xcite ( extended in @xcite ) builds on these approaches with ensemble classifiers that account for additional features such as time zone and volume of tweets per hour . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "@xcite showcases the current state - of - the - art for content - based geotagging : @xmath17 test users at @xmath18 city - accuracy .",
    "our goal is similar to that of @xcite in that both works focus on static location inference with city - resolution accuracy , however , we demonstrate several orders of magnitude greater coverage as well as higher accuracy .",
    "specifically , our leave - many - out validation tests indicate that we can correctly predict the city a user resides in with vs @xmath19 city - accurate vs. the @xmath18 reported by @xcite .    geotagging via natural language processing",
    "requires that users from different geographic regions tweet in different dialects , and that these differences are great enough to make accurate location inference possible .",
    "evidence against this possibility appears in @xcite , where the author examined a large twitter dataset and found minimal agreement between language models and proximity .",
    "additionally , language - based geotagging methods often rely on sophisticated language - specific natural language processing and are thus difficult to extend worldwide .",
    "large - scale language - agnostic geotagging is possible by inferring a user s location with the known locations of their friends .",
    "influential work in this field was conducted at facebook inc . in @xcite . here",
    ", the authors infer a user s home address with a maximum likelihood estimate that best fits an empirically observed power law .",
    "surprisingly , the results of @xcite indicate that social network based methods are _ more _ accurate than ip - based geolocation .",
    "since the ip addresses of twitter users are never public , and our research involves public data alone , we can not report any results about how the present work compares against ip - based twitter geolocation .",
    "geotagging work on flickr and twitter by sadilek _",
    "@xcite uses social ties to infer location and then studies the converse problem : using location to infer social ties .",
    "they conclude that location alone is insufficient for this task .",
    "very recent work by @xcite uses network structure as well as language processing of user profiles to identify `` landmark '' users in the united states for whom location inference is optimal while @xcite showcases a similar result on korean twitter users .",
    "most closely related to our work is that of @xcite , where the author developed a node - wise algorithm , `` spatial label propagation '' , which iteratively estimates twitter user locations by propagating the locations of gps - known users across a twitter social network . while not discussed in @xcite , it turns out that spatial label propagation is in fact a parallel coordinate descent method applied to total variation minimization . later in this work",
    "we show how our technique can reduce to spatial label propagation by removing constraints on ( [ eq : mediantv ] ) .",
    "while spatial label propagation was demonstrated at scale , our study reaches higher coverage and accuracy : @xmath20 m users at a median error of @xmath21 km vs. @xmath22 m users at a median error of @xmath23 km .",
    "research indicating that twitter contact is independent of proximity can be found in @xcite , where the author examines gps - known retweet pairings and finds an average distance of @xmath24 miles between users .",
    "averages , however , are sensitive to outliers which are often present in social data . in this work , we will make use of robust statistics to estimate center and spread for sets of locations .",
    "an appropriate social network is a fundamental part of our algorithm .",
    "twitter users often `` @mention '' each other by appending an `` @ '' to the mentioned user s name .",
    "we build a social network , @xmath25 , with users as vertices and @mentions between users as edges .    reciprocated @mentions indicate social ties .",
    "we define edge weights , @xmath8 , of @xmath26 , the `` bidirectional @mention network '' , using the minimum number of reciprocated @mentions between users @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the key advantage to constructing a social graph from @mentions ( as opposed from  followers \" or  favourites \" ) is that it enables us to build a large social graph from a large collection of tweets without being burdened by twitter api rate limiting .",
    "we use a @xmath27 sample of public tweets collected between april 2012 and april 2014 .",
    "this amounts to @xmath28 tb of json data ( uncompressed ) and @xmath29 @mentions . from the complete set of @mentions we built a weighted and directed network of @xmath30 edges by condensing multiple mentions into weighted edges . filtering down to only reciprocated @mentions",
    "leaves us with a network of @xmath31 edges chance of @mention reciprocation ] and @xmath32 users .",
    "this bidirected network is the focus of our experiments .",
    "we define a function , @xmath33 , which assigns to each user an estimate of their physical location .",
    "users may opt to make their location publicly available though cellphone - enabled gps or self - reported profile information . for this small set of users , computation of @xmath33",
    "is relatively straightforward .    to assign a unique location to a user from the set of their gps - tagged tweets , @xmath34 , we compute the @xmath35-multivariate median @xcite of the locations they have tweeted from : @xmath36    our data contains @xmath37 users who have tweeted with gps at least three times .",
    "several of these users are highly mobile and can not reasonably be assigned a single , static , location .",
    "we filter out users whose median absolute deviation ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : mediantv ] ) ) of gps - annotated tweet locations is over @xmath38 km .",
    "this leaves with a set of @xmath39 users whose location might be known via gps .",
    "however , tweet timestamps reveal that @xmath40 of these users have at some point exceeded the flight airspeed record of @xmath41 km / h .",
    "manual examination of these accounts finds several bots retweeting worldwide gps - annotated tweets as well as human users who suffer gps malfunctions ( e.g. a tweet near @xmath42 shortly after a valid location ) .",
    "we remove from our training set any user who has travelled in excess of @xmath43 km / h .",
    "the total number of gps - known users is @xmath44 .    following this , we extract self - reported home locations by searching through a list of @xmath45 unambiguous location names for exact matches in user profiles .",
    "users who list several locations in their profile are not geotagged by this step , though it is possible to account for such users using a method found in @xcite .",
    "when self - reporting users also reveal their location though gps , we opt to use their gps - known location .",
    "we remove self - reports which are over @xmath46 days old .",

    "the list of @xmath45 location names has been optimized for accuracy on twitter .",
    "starting with an initial list of @xmath50 location names obtained from the geonames project , we examined @xmath51 gps - tagged tweets from users who self - reported profile locations and removed location names from the list when the median discrepancy between gps and the reported location was greater than @xmath52 km .",

    "users with gps - known locations make up only a tiny portion of our @mention networks . despite the relatively small amount of data ,",

    "the optimization ( [ eq : tvopt ] ) models proximity of connected users .",
    "unfortunately , the total variation functional is nondifferentiable and finding a global minimum is thus a formidable challenge .",
    "we will employ `` parallel coordinate descent '' @xcite to solve ( [ eq : tvopt ] ) .",
    "most variants of coordinate descent cycle through the domain sequentially , updating each variable and communicating back the result before the next variable can update .",
    "the scale of our data necessitates a parallel approach , prohibiting us from making all the communication steps required by a traditional coordinate descent method .    at each iteration",

    "however , there do exist several users who have amassed friends dispersed around the globe .",
    "for these users , our approach should not be used to infer location .",
    "we use a robust estimate of the dispersion of each user s friend locations to infer accuracy of our geocoding algorithm .",

    "<S> geographically annotated social media is extremely valuable for modern information retrieval . however , </S>",
    "<S> when researchers can only access publicly - visible data , one quickly finds that social media users rarely publish location information . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a method which can geolocate the overwhelming majority of active twitter users , independent of their location sharing preferences , using only publicly - visible twitter data .    </S>",
    "<S> our method infers an unknown user s location by examining their friend s locations . </S>",
    "<S> we frame the geotagging problem as an optimization over a social network with a total variation - based objective and provide a scalable and distributed algorithm for its solution . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show how a robust estimate of the geographic dispersion of each user s ego network can be used as a per - user accuracy measure which is effective at removing outlying errors </S>",
    "<S> .    leave - many - out evaluation shows that our method is able to infer location for @xmath0 twitter users at a median error of @xmath1 km , allowing us to geotag over @xmath2 of public tweets .    social and information networks ; data mining ; optimization </S>"
