    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in magnetic traps @xcite has induced a great interest in the properties of quantum atomic gases and their manipulation by atom optic techniques .",
    "although the latter are usually used for laser cooling in the formation process of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , confinement in an optical dipole - trap has been demonstrated only recently @xcite .",
    "the all - optical confinement of a bec provides a great potential for the manipulation and application of bec .",
    "in particular , it opens the new opportunity to study atomic becs in optical lattices . in recent years",
    "experimentalists have made great efforts to create a bec in optical lattices .",
    "although there are presently still some technical problems to achieve this goal the rich physics of uncondensed ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and quasi - crystals @xcite has attracted great interest for both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "recently , several theoretical papers dealing with condensates in optical potentials have been published @xcite    in this paper we focus on a new aspect of this subject : light propagation through a coherent condensate confined in an optical lattice .",
    "since the ground state of the condensate in a lattice potential is periodic , it will act as a periodic dielectric for laser light propagating through it .",
    "thus it will give rise to photonic band gaps at optical frequencies .",
    "the phenomenon of photonic band gaps is a natural consequence of the periodicity of the condensate .",
    "in fact , it also should occur for uncondensed ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "however , in the case of a condensed atomic lattice what is interesting is that , because of the macroscopic occupation of the ground state , a proper description of photonic band gaps is given in terms of polaritons ( an entangled coherent system composed of superpositions of photons and excited atoms ) .",
    "furthermore , elementary excitations may be present in the lattice bec .",
    "in general these excitations are no longer periodic and will cause distortions of the perfect periodic structure of the condensed atomic lattice .",
    "an excitation - induced defect in the atomic lattice in turn causes the occurence of defect states inside photonic band gaps of light propagating through the bec . in this sense ,",
    "elementary excitations have a close analogy to lattice defects in solid state physics which cause defect states in the electronic band structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we will derive the equations of motion . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the case where only the lattice laser beams are present and seek for a periodic solution to the coupled equations of motion describing the ground - state bec and the lattice laser beams .",
    "this solution shows that the optical potential experiences no back - reaction from the condensate if the latter has settled down into its ground state . in this sense , the lattice laser beams just effectively act as a constant periodic potential for the bec . in sec .",
    "iv we consider the propagation of a weak probe laser beam through the ground - state bec and derive the form of the lowest photonic band gap for this beam by using polariton modes . to examine the behaviour of a probe laser beam propagating through a weakly non - periodic bec a theory of defect states for photonic band gaps is developed in sec .",

    "vi to the koster - slater model for a localized elementary excitation . sec .",
    "vii concludes the paper .",
    "the system under consideration consists of interacting two - level atoms which are coupled to the electromagnetic field .",
    "this coupling is described by using the electric - dipole and rotating - wave approximation so that the corresponding second quantized hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 describes the atomic center - of - mass motion .",
    "@xmath3 denotes an external potential .",
    "@xmath4 represents the atomic mass , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the internal energy levels for ground - state and excited atoms , respectively . the corresponding field operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 fulfill the commutation relations @xmath9 = \\delta_{ij } \\delta(\\vec{x}-\\vec{y})$ ] .",
    "@xmath10 is the nonlinear part of the atomic hamiltonian which describes two - body collisions . for a dilute bose gas",
    "it can be approximated by @xmath11 where @xmath12 are coupling constants and @xmath13 denote the scattering lengths for scattering between atoms in the internal state @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "for the description of the electromagnetic field we use the representation in terms of positive end negative frequency parts of the vector potential , @xmath16 .",
    "this representation will turn out to be convenient for the adiabatic elimination of excited atoms .",
    "the hamiltonian for the free electromagnetic field then takes the simple form @xmath17 the positive and negative frequency parts are related by @xmath18 and fulfill the commutation relation @xmath19 =   ( \\hbar/2 \\varepsilon_0 ) \\hat{\\omega}^{-1 }   \\delta_{ab}^t(\\vec { x}-\\vec { y})$ ] , where @xmath20 is the transverse delta function . the _ frequency operator _",
    "@xmath21 is a pseudo - differential operator whose action is defined in momentum space by @xmath22(\\vec{x } ) =    ( 2\\pi)^{-3/2 } \\int d^3 k e^{i \\vec{k}\\cdot \\vec{x } }      c |\\vec{k}| \\vec{a}(\\vec{k})\\ ; .\\ ] ] the physical interpretation of the frequency operator is simple .",
    "it just multiplies a photon mode with its frequency @xmath23 .",
    "a more compact representation of @xmath21 in position space is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the laplace operator .",
    "using the positive and negative frequency part of the vector potential the electric dipole coupling between the atoms and the electromagnetic field in rotating - wave approximation can be written as @xmath26    the heisenberg equations of motion derived from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) are given by @xmath27",
    "to analyse the interaction between the atoms and the lattice laser beams in absence of an external potential ( @xmath28 ) we restrict us to the particular case where the atomic field is composed of condensed atoms , i.e. , a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this allows us to make further substantial simplifications .",
    "as is well - known a condensate can be described by assuming that all atoms are in the same quantum state @xmath29 .",
    "this amounts in replacing the field operator @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ gdgl ] ) by the c - number field @xmath29 which then fulfills a nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "in addition , we assume that the photon fluctuations of the lattice laser beams are small and therefore not important for our case .",
    "this allows us to replace the operator @xmath30 by a corresponding classical field vector @xmath31 of the lattice laser beams .",
    "we consider the regime of coherent interaction where the electromagnetic field is detuned far away from the atomic resonance frequency @xmath32 .",
    "specifically , we assume that the detuning @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) of the lattice laser beams is negative ( red detuning ) and its absolute value much larger than any other characeristic frequency of our system so that we can adiabatically eliminate the excited atoms @xcite .",
    "this amounts in replacing the field operator for excited atoms by @xmath35 inserting eq .",
    "( [ adiab ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ gdgl ] ) and ( [ adgl ] ) one easily finds ( to first order in @xmath36 ) @xmath37 eqs.([gdgl2 ] ) and ( [ adgl2 ] ) describe the coherent coupling of a ground - state atomic field to the lattice laser beams .",
    "the physics implicit in these equations is straightforward .",
    "the laser beams induce an optical potential for ground state atoms which is proportional to the light intensity ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the atoms in turn act on the electromagnetic field like a dielectric , where the index of refraction is determined by the density @xmath39 of ground - state atoms .",
    "we are interested in how the condensate affects the lattice laser beams and the corresponding back - reaction in the optical potential . for simplicity , we take the laser beam to be parallel to the x - axis . further , we assume that the bec has settled to its ground - state which , because of the periodicity of the optical potential provided by the lattice laser beams , is periodic .",

    "it is defined by its relation to the spatial period @xmath42 of the optical lattice by @xmath43 .",
    "this period @xmath42 differs in general slightly from the wavelength of the laser beams outside the atomic medium @xcite .",
    "transforming eqs .",
    "( [ gdgl2 ] ) and ( [ adgl2 ] ) to momentum space we arrive at the following one - dimensional set of equations , @xmath44 where we have defined the transversal dipole moment of the atoms @xmath45 .",
    "we can now exploit the fact that the optical frequency @xmath46 is typically ( very ) much larger than any other frequency scale involved in the system .",
    "this allows us to perform a rotating - wave approximation by inserting @xmath47 into eqs .",
    "( [ momg ] ) and ( [ moma ] ) and neglecting all terms which rotate at multiples of the frequency @xmath46 .",
    "this procedure results in the simplified equations @xmath48 these equations have some properties which allow to decouple the system for some physically interesting cases .",
    "the most important one is that the atoms do only couple counterpropagating modes , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of energy conservation since a transition to any other mode would require an amount of energy in the order of @xmath51 which can not be provided by the interaction with the condensate .",
    "in addition , it is not difficult to see that both the mean density @xmath52 and the mean light intensity per mode , @xmath53 , respectively . therefore , the first sums on the right - hand - side of eqs .",
    "( [ mom2 g ] ) and ( [ mom2a ] ) just produce a constant shift of the energy levels .",
    "we now consider a solution of the system of equations ( [ mom2 g ] ) and ( [ mom2a ] ) which corresponds to a standing - wave lattice laser beam interacting with a bec in its ground state in the coherent regime . for a standing - wave lattice",
    ", we can make the ansatz @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , in the ground state of the bec the time dependence of all coefficients @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 \\psi_l(0)$ ] , where @xmath57 denotes the chemical potential and @xmath58 can be chosen to be real .",
    "it is then not difficult to show that @xmath54 holds for all times ( by differentiating both sides and comparing the results ) .",
    "in addition , the expression @xmath59 , which describes the optical potential in eq .",
    "( [ mom2 g ] ) , is time - independent , too .",
    "an immediate consequence of this fact is that in the coherent regime the optical potential created by the lattice laser beams for the bec in eq .",
    "( [ mom2 g ] ) is not altered by the condensate itself .",
    "thus , the problem is decoupled and the condensate behaves as if it were moving in a given external periodic potential . in this sense",
    "the influence of the lattice laser beams on the bec can be replaced by an external potential @xmath3 with periodicity @xmath60 .",
    "in the preceding section we have shown how the combined system of a bec and lattice laser beams behaves in its ground state .",
    "we are now interested in a different situation where a running probe laser beam propagates through the `` lattice condensate '' ( condensate plus lattice laser beams ) .",
    "the behaviour of the probe laser can intuitively understood by considering the bec as a kind of dielectric for the probe laser beam .",
    "since the bec is periodic the probe laser beam will effectively propagate through a periodic dielectric .",
    "we thus expect it to show the phenomenon of photonic band gaps @xcite .    to describe the interaction of the probe laser beam with the condensate we will assume that the ground - state bec changes little so that @xmath29 enters as a given external field into the equations of motion for excited atoms ( [ edgl ] ) and for the probe laser beam ( [ adgl ] )",
    ". solutions of these coupled equation describe polariton modes , i.e. , entangled superpositions of matter and light fields @xcite .",
    "thus , it is really `` polaritonic '' band gaps rather than photonic band gaps that we are studying .",
    "however , for sufficiently large detuning of the lattice laser beams the entanglement is very small so that the result indeed can be considered as photonic band gaps .    to find a suitable expression for the ground - state wavefunction @xmath29 we use the results of the preceding section , i.e. , consider the case where the bec is confined by a periodic potential of the form @xmath61 ( we choose the factor of @xmath62 since the potential created by an optical lattice of wavevector @xmath63 would create such a potential @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we consider a very weak probe beam and neglect the four - wave mixing effect due to the interference between the probe laser and the lattice lasers @xcite . as a result",
    ", the ground state of the bec can effectively be described by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath64 where @xmath57 is the chemical potential . in the",
    "experimentally realized dilute bose condensates the interaction energy of the two - body collisions between atoms is usually large , so that one can perform the thomas - fermi approximation by neglecting the kinetic energy .",
    "this transforms eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) into a simple algebraic equation whose solution is of the form @xmath65 .",
    "this solution is valid for all @xmath66 if the optical potential is not too strong , so that @xmath67 is smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath67 is not too close to @xmath68 we furthermore can simplify the wavefunction to @xmath69 ( this time - independent expression is valid in a frame rotating at frequency @xmath70 ) .",
    "we remark that this expression produces qualitatively correct results for the lowest photonic band even if the kinetic energy is not negligible or @xmath71 because the corresponding correction essentially introduce higher coefficients in the fourier series of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "since these higher coefficients do only couple higher bands , they do not affect the results for the lowest band .",
    "since @xmath29 does not depend on @xmath72 and @xmath73 it is advantageous to rescale the wavefunctions as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the typical extension of the bec in the @xmath72 and @xmath73 direction .",
    "this guarantees that the one - dimensional integral @xmath76 is dimensionless and can be interpreted as a particle number . in the actual calculations",
    "this rescaling leads to the appearance of various factors of @xmath75 .",

    "since the density of excited atoms should be very small we have neglected two - body collisions between excited atoms ( @xmath79 in eq .",
