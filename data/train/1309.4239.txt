    "recently there has been widespread renewed interest  spurred on by the many interesting developments in cluster algebras  in tilting phenomena . in particular , the geometrical interpretation of cluster - tilting objects in cluster categories as triangulations suggests the consideration of similar models in relation to other algebras .",
    "one such area of interest is the class of finite - dimensional self - injective algebras .",
    "finite dimensional self - injective algebras encompass a large variety of algebras , such as the group algebras of finite groups , hecke algebras and special biserial algebras .",
    "the last family is particularly interesting , as large parts of the representation theory and ( co)homology are well - studied and understood .",
    "the class of symmetric special biserial algebras coincides with the class of brauer graph algebras  @xcite .",
    "brauer graph algebras can be described in two important ways , firstly as a quotient of the path algebra of a quiver , and secondly via a graph , the brauer graph , with a circular ordering on the edges around each vertex , together with some special ( exceptional ) vertices with associated multiplicities .",
    "this combinatorial description makes them particularly amenable to calculations and combinatorial studies .",
    "we observe that the definition of a brauer graph without exceptional vertices is essentially that of a ribbon graph ( or fat graph ) .",
    "such a graph has a natural filling embedding into an oriented surface ( see  @xcite ) giving rise to the cyclic ordering of the edges incident with each vertex .",
    "conversely , such an embedding gives rise to a brauer graph without exceptional vertices .",
    "in particular , kauer  @xcite shows that if a certain local move ( which we call a _ kauer move _ ) is applied to the graph of a brauer graph algebra , the resulting brauer graph algebra is derived equivalent to the initial algebra .",
    "we show that if a brauer graph arises from a triangulation of a compact oriented marked surface ( regarded as the embedding of a graph ) , then the kauer move coincides with the flip of the triangulation which corresponds to mutation in the cluster algebra associated to the surface  @xcite .",
    "it follows that we can associate a brauer graph algebra to a compact oriented marked surface ( by choosing a triangulation ) which is unique up to derived equivalence .",
    "we also give a version of this for the case of a surface with boundary .    in the case of a disc with marked points on its boundary",
    "we consider not only triangulations but @xmath0-angulations .",
    "for such an @xmath0-angulation , regarded as a brauer graph without exceptional vertex , the kauer move again coincides with the mutation of the @xmath0-angulation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) in the cluster sense .",
    "we may also consider the dual graph of the @xmath0-angulation , which is an @xmath1-ary tree .",
    "mutation of the @xmath0-angulation induces a move which coincides with a _",
    "nearest neighbour interchange _ ( in the sense of  @xcite , which refers to  @xcite ) , or _ whitehead move _ , i.e.  the contraction and expansion of a given edge .",
    "note that in the case of a triangulation the effect on the dual graph corresponds to the associativity rule as described , for example , in  @xcite .    in the case of a triangulation of a disc , a mutation or flip of",
    "a diagonal corresponds to four different things simultaneously : a mutation of the associated cluster , a derived equivalence of the brauer graph algebra whose graph is the triangulation , a derived equivalence of the brauer tree algebra of the dual graph of the triangulation and , using  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , a derived equivalence of endomorphism algebras in frobenius categories in the cluster context .",
    "we observe that in the case of brauer graph algebras the brauer graph algebra associated to an @xmath0-angulation is of tame representation type whereas the one associated to the dual graph is of finite representation type .    in section 1",
    "we recall the concept of a brauer graph algebra and recall the pivotal result of kauer on derived equivalences of brauer graph algebras which lies at the heart of this paper .",
    "as we expect the audience of this paper to have a more algebraic background we begin section 2 with a short recall of the theory of ribbon graphs and surfaces , and go on to show how up to derived equivalence there is a unique brauer graph algebra associated to every compact oriented marked surface ( with or without boundary ) . in section 3",
    "we explain how our results are connected with the theory of cluster algebras and cluster categories . in section 4",
    "we consider @xmath0-angulations of a disc with marked points on its boundary .",
    "we give an explicit two - term tilting complex , compatible with the geometry , realising the derived equivalence of brauer tree algebras induced by the move on the dual graph induced by mutation of a diagonal in the @xmath0-angulation .",
    "finally , in section 5 we give counter - examples to show that the brauer graph algebras of the dual graphs associated to two graphs related by the kauer move need nt necessarily be derived equivalent in general , by considering the cases of a triangulation of a sphere and a punctured disk .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for helpful comments on the first version of this paper .",

    "_ relations of type ii _ :",

    "a.   we do not allow truncated edges in the sense of  @xcite here .",
    "b.   in @xcite it is shown that for any given brauer graph there is a tower of coverings of brauer graphs corresponding to a tower of coverings of brauer graph algebras such that the topmost covering brauer graph has no loops , no multiple edges and multiplicity function identical to 1 . c.   we do not consider the quantized case of  @xcite .",
    "the brauer graph algebras that we consider here are all symmetric algebras ( recall that a finite dimensional @xmath2-algebra @xmath6 is symmetric if there exists an isomorphism of @xmath6-@xmath6-bimodules between @xmath6 and @xmath47 ) .",

    ".,width=377 ]    [ fig : kauermove ]    we call the move appearing in theorem  [ thm : kauermove ] the _ kauer move _ at the edge @xmath29 .",
    "we note that this derived equivalence has later also been considered in  @xcite where in some cases it is called a tilting mutation in analogy with the corresponding mutation in cluster theory ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to introduce ribbon graphs and to establish the fact that a brauer graph is a ribbon graph with a vertex labelling corresponding to the values of the multiplicity function of the brauer graph .",
    "the natural embedding of a ribbon graph into a compact oriented marked surface gives a natural way to associate a surface to a brauer graph algebra .",
    "we will also see that , by considering triangulations , we can associate to every compact oriented marked surface a brauer graph algebra unique up to derived equivalence ( although we note that this is not the inverse of the above operation ) .    first , we recall part of the well - known theory of ribbon graphs and their embeddings into surfaces , following  @xcite . we will break this section into two parts . in the first part we consider marked surfaces without boundary and in the second we consider marked surfaces with boundary .",
    "we begin by giving the definition of a _ ribbon graph _ or _",

    "we call the pair @xmath63 an _ undirected edge_. thus we are regarding an undirected edge as a pair of directed edges in opposite directions between the same pair of vertices ( which might be equal , in the case of a loop ) .    the _ geometric realisation _ @xmath64 of @xmath57 is the topological space @xmath65)/{\\sim},$ ] where @xmath66 is the equivalence relation defined by @xmath67 ( for all @xmath68 $ ] ) , @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 if @xmath72 , for all @xmath73 .",
    "a _ cyclic _ ordering of a finite set @xmath74 is a bijection @xmath75 satisfying @xmath76 for all @xmath77 .",
    "the _ predecessor _ of @xmath78 is @xmath79 and the _ successor _ of @xmath80 is @xmath81 .    if @xmath82 , then the _ star _ of @xmath49 is @xmath83 a _ ribbon graph _ ( or fat graph ) is a graph together with a cyclic ordering on @xmath84 on @xmath85 for each @xmath82 . morphisms and isomorphisms of ribbon graphs are then defined in the natural way .",
    "it is easy to see that :    a ribbon graph is a brauer graph without exceptional vertices . in particular , the way loops work ( see section 1.1 above ) , ensures that the definitions of ribbon graphs and brauer graphs coincide .",
    "thus a brauer graph can be regarded as a ribbon graph with a multiplicity attached to each of its vertices .",
    "examples of ribbon graphs include planar graphs and graphs locally embedded in the plane .",
    "an embedding of a graph into an oriented surface induces a ribbon graph structure on the graph , with cyclic ordering induced from the embedding around each vertex and the orientation of the surface .",
    "conversely , every brauer graph with multiplicity function identically equal to 1 gives rise to an oriented surface with boundary :    @xcite every ribbon graph @xmath15 can be embedded in an oriented surface with boundary in such a way that the cyclic orderings around each of its vertices arise from the orientation of the surface .",
    "the _ ribbon surface _ @xmath86 of @xmath15 is an example of such a surface .",
    "it can be constructed in the following way .",
    "firstly , a surface is associated to each vertex and edge of @xmath15 as in figure  [ fig : localsurface ] .",
    "then the structure of the graph determines a gluing of the corresponding surfaces giving an oriented surface together with an embedding of @xmath15 .",

    "( see  @xcite ) [ pro : embeddingexists ] every ribbon graph has a filling embedding into a compact oriented surface such that the connected components of @xmath100 are in bijection with the faces of @xmath15 in the above sense .",
    "this is proved by gluing discs onto the ribbon surface of the ribbon graph to fill in the boundary components .",
    "such an embedding has the following uniqueness property :    ( see  @xcite ) [ pro : fillinguniqueness ] let @xmath101 , @xmath102 be filling embeddings of ribbon graphs of compact oriented surfaces @xmath103 and @xmath104 an isomorphism of ribbon graphs .",
