    "a simple example is @xmath634 and @xmath635 , where @xmath636 is a common zero of @xmath637 and @xmath638 .",
    "this zero is common to the all family @xmath639 .",
    "looking at @xmath640 , we observe that we can regularize it at @xmath419 and that it is enough to apply the previous argument for showing that there is at least two solutions of @xmath641 for @xmath642 ( see figure [ fig : cos-3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "this is of course trivial in this case .     in the interval @xmath189.,width=302 ]    the general case is similar .",
    "we first determine the cardinal @xmath643 of the set @xmath644 in @xmath645 ) of the @xmath183 s such that @xmath646 is a zero of @xmath647 .",
    "similarly , we consider the set of the @xmath311 such that @xmath648 for some @xmath183 .",
    "another way of presentation is to claim the existence of a polynomial @xmath649 of degree @xmath643 such that @xmath650 so that the regularization of @xmath287 is given by : @xmath651 it suffices to do the same proof as before but keeping only in our construction the @xmath652 which are not the @xmath643 common zeros of @xmath582 and @xmath583 .",
    "the proof is then identical and will give at least @xmath653 solutions of @xmath654 , hence of @xmath655 in addition to the @xmath643 previously obtained .",

    "then the eigenfunction @xmath657 satisfies @xmath658    this is obtained by using euler s formula , which implies ( forgetting the contribution of the critical points inside the square ) @xmath659 where @xmath660 is the number of connected components of @xmath661 ( @xmath662 being the zero set of @xmath34 ) . using @xmath663 and proposition [ prop : touchingpoints ] we get  .",
    "this gives a rather explicit way to prove that for a specific family which seems relatively generic ( any family corresponding to eigenvalues of multiplicity at most @xmath298 ) the number of nodal domains tends to @xmath577 .",
