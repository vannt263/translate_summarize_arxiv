    "the rate of tidal disruption events in these systems is expected to be @xmath234 per globular cluster @xcite . taking a globular cluster space density of @xmath235 @xcite we estimate the density rate of rt to be at most @xmath236 . in this case",
    ", lsst should detect rt events arising from the disruption of a @xmath237 star with a rate of @xmath238 .",
    "the globular cluster luminosity function in the galaxies studied to date @xcite is well fit by a gaussian distribution with a peak @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the rt should thus easily outshine the cluster s optical luminosity .",
    "non - detection of flares after a few years would argue against the existence of intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters .",
    "the purpose of this paper is has been to explore whether the unbound debris of tidal disruption might give rise to luminous optical emission , and to determine under what conditions this emission may be observationally relevant .",
    "the analytical results predict a brief ( 3 - 5 day ) optical transient with peak luminosities in the range @xmath241  @xmath2 .",
    "the energy for the emission is stored mostly in the ionization energy of hydrogen , and is released when the ejecta becomes neutral and transparent at temperatures @xmath242  k. this physics will be relevant not only for the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes , but to the weak ejection of hydrogen envelopes in general by , e.g. , stellar collisions or pulsations .",
    "the predicted bolometric luminosities of the recombination transients fall into the interesting  that is to say , relatively unexplored  range between novae and supernovae .",
    "upcoming synoptic surveys will begin to probe these sorts of intermediate events .",
    "the rt of 1  @xmath4  stars are relatively dim events which would only be visible in the nearby universe ( @xmath5  mpc ) .",
    "the disruption of more massive stars ( @xmath243 ) , on the other hand , can be quite bright .",
    "such events may not be as rare as one might first expect .",
    "there is strong evidence that the initial mass function of stars within the galactic center is top heavy @xcite .",
    "perhaps massive stars are more common in the cores of other galaxies as well .    for massive black holes , @xmath207 , the optical luminosity from the accretion of bound material",
    "likely surpasses the emission from the unbound debris .",
    "nevertheless , the rt may still be discernible as a precursor , and may provide a important complementary signature . while the properties of the accretion flare depends most sensitively on the black hole mass , the luminosity of the rt depends primarily on the properties of the disrupted star , with little dependence on @xmath29 . in principle observations of both components",
    "would allow one to solve for the parameters of the event , providing insight into both the black hole mass and stellar population in the centers of distant galaxies .",
    "more basically , detection of a rt would provide confirmation that the event witnessed was in fact a legitimate tidal disruption ,    recombination transients appear to be of greatest interest for probing lower mass black holes ( @xmath244 ) . in these systems ,",
    "the optical luminosity of the transient is likely to exceed that of accretion , and should outshine the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "this offers one means of searching for low mass black holes in dwarf galaxies , or for intermediate mass black hole in globular clusters .",
    "if black holes do lurk in these numerous locations , the recombination transient might be the most prominent optical signature of a stellar disruption .",

    "<S> in the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole , roughly half of the stellar mass becomes bound and falls into the black hole , while the other half is ejected at high velocity . </S>",
    "<S> several previous studies have considered the emission resulting from the accretion of bound material ; we consider the possibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded and become transparent . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gradual energy input from hydrogen recombination compensates for adiabatic loses over significant expansion factors . </S>",
    "<S> the opacity also drops dramatically with recombination , and the internal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling - transparency wave propagating from the surface layers inward . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a brief optical transient occurring @xmath0 week after disruption and lasting 3 - 5 days with peak luminosities of @xmath1  @xmath2 , depending on the mass of the disrupted star . </S>",
    "<S> these recombination powered transients should accompany the x - ray / ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material , and so may be a useful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events , especially for lower and intermediate mass black holes . </S>"
