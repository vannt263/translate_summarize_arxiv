    "in this paper we analyze a system of identical interacting bosons by using the hard sphere ( hs ) model @xcite , which is a useful reference system for classical and quantum many - body theories both for weak and strong interactions because it depends only on one interaction parameter : the sphere diameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the quantum hs model has led to the understanding of several general features of helium in its condensed phases @xcite , serving as a reference or a starting point for studies with more accurate potentials @xcite .",
    "in addition the quantum hs model provides the standard benchmark for mean  field approaches @xcite such as , for example , gross - pitaevskii equation or hartree  fock  bogoliubov approximation @xcite .",
    "a large number of approaches have been put forward to deal with quantum hs and , among them , monte carlo method based on feynmans path integrals come out as a most powerful tool @xcite .",
    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) studies of quantum hs systems at finite temperature cover almost the whole relevant gas parameter range @xcite .",
    "however , at zero temperature , there are studies that cover ( with different techniques ) only portions of the @xmath0 range and are mainly devoted to the investigation of different properties such as the universal behavior in the dilute limit @xcite or the gas  solid transition @xcite .    here",
    "we calculate the equation of state of the bulk quantum hs system of identical bosons from very low gas parameter value up to high density solid with path integral ground state ( pigs ) monte carlo @xcite method , which provides exact expectation values on the ground state .",
    "our exact pigs results for the equation of state are then used to derive other relevant properties by means of the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "actual experiments on bosonic atomic gases reach so low temperatures that the effects of thermal fluctuations are largely negligible , making a zero temperature approach well justified@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the basic features of pigs method are reported in section ii .",
    "numerical results on the ground - state energy and condensate fraction are shown and discussed in section iii , where we compare our data with previous monte carlo calculations and other theoretical approaches . in section iv we introduce the zero - temperature hydrodynamic equations of superfluids @xcite and we use them ( with the pigs equation of state ) to find other relevant quantities as a function of the gas parameter : the chemical potential , the pressure and the sound velocity .",
    "we find that our sound velocity , which gives the low - momentum linear slope of the excitation spectrum , is in excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained with the help of the pigs static response function .",
    "moreover , within the feynman s approximation , we determine the full spectrum of elementary excitations , which displays a maxon - roton behavior when the gas parameter is close to the freezing value .",
    "in section v we consider the inclusion of an anisotropic but axially - symmetric trapping harmonic potential .",
    "the collective modes of the confined bose gas are then easily calculated using again the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics with the pigs equation of state , which is locally approximated with a polytropic equation of state @xcite .",
    "the paper is concluded by section vi .",
    "the aim of pigs is to improve a variationally optimized trial wave function @xmath5 by constructing , in the hilbert space of the system , a path which connects the starting @xmath5 with the exact lowest energy wave function of the system , @xmath6 , constrained by the choice of the number of particles @xmath7 , the geometry of the simulation box , the boundary conditions and the density @xmath1 , provided that @xmath8 . the correct correlations among the particles arise during this path through the action of the imaginary time evolution operator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian operator . in principle , @xmath6 is reached in the limit of infinite imaginary time , but a very accurate representation for @xmath6 is given by @xmath11 , if @xmath12 is large enough ( but finite ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath13 can be analytically written by discretizing the path in small imaginary time steps .",
    "this discretization is necessary since the aviable approximations for @xmath14 became more accurate as the imaginary time step goes smaller @xcite .",
    "here we have used the cao ",
    "berne approximation @xcite , which is one of the most efficient propagators ( i.e. allows for larger values of imaginary time step ) for hs @xcite . because because of this discretization of the imaginary time path , the quantum system is mapped into a system of specially interacting classical open polymers @xcite .",
    "each open polymer represents the full imaginary time path of a quantum particle that is sampled by means of the metropolis algorithm .",
    "thus , the entire imaginary time evolution of the system is sampled at each monte carlo step @xcite .",
    "an appealing feature of the pigs method is that , in @xmath13 , the variational ansatz acts only as a starting point , while the full path is governed by @xmath14 , which depends only on the hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "thus the pigs method turns out to be unbiased by the choice of the trial wave function @xcite and then the only input is @xmath10 . in the coordinate representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum hs system is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be reduced in a useful adimensional form by giving the energies in unit of @xmath18 and the lengths in unit of @xmath2 , which represents also the s  wave scattering length .",
    "we make use of these reduced units throughout the paper .",
    "the trial wave function @xmath5 does not really need to be fully variational optimized : in fact , for a large enough value of @xmath12 , pigs results turn out to be independent on @xmath5 , in both the phases @xcite . the sole role of @xmath5 is to determine the length of the path in imaginary time @xcite to converge on @xmath6 : better is @xmath5 , faster is the convergence . here , as @xmath5",
    ", we have employed a jastrow wave function , where the two - body correlations are given by the fist order expansion of the exact solution for the two - body problem i.e. : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the coordinates of the @xmath7 hs .",
    "all the approximations involved in the pigs method , i.e. the choice of the total imaginary time @xmath12 and of the imaginary time step @xmath21 ( that fixes the quality of the approximation on @xmath14 ) , are so well controlled that the resulting systematic errors can be reduced within the unavoidable monte carlo statistical error . in this sense pigs is an exact @xmath22 k method @xcite .    in order to improve the ergodicity of the monte carlo sampling",
    ", we have implemented bosonic permutations @xcite , even if not required in principle since ( [ psit ] ) has the correct bose symmetry , and a canonical ( i.e. with fixed @xmath7 ) version of the worm algorithm @xcite , which has the ulterior advantage of giving access also to off - diagonal properties within the same simulation .",
    "we have studied with pigs a system of @xmath23 hs in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions in all the directions , for values of the gas parameter @xmath0 ranging from dilute gas , namely @xmath24 , up to @xmath25 , deep inside the solid phase . by studying the convergence in @xmath12 and @xmath21 of the energy per particle",
    "we have fixed the values @xmath26",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28  @xmath27 to be a very good compromise between accuracy and computational cost .",
    "for some values of @xmath0 , we have check the convergence of our results both by reducing the time step to @xmath29  @xmath27 and by extending the total projection time up to @xmath30  @xmath27 .",
    "we have performed also simulations with @xmath31 and @xmath32 hs in order to verify the presence of size effects , especially close to the gas - solid transition region .",
    "we find that the energy per particle does not sensibly change within the error bars , inferring that our results are no affected by a significant size effect .",
    "our results for the energy per particle @xmath33 as a function of the gas parameter are reported in fig .",
    "[ liquid ] .",
    "we find an excellent agreement with previous gfmc @xcite and dmc data @xcite in the range of gas parameter values covered by the previous studies .",
    "we report also two mean field predictions for @xmath33 : the perturbative correction to the bogoliubov mean - field due to lee , huang and yang ( lhy ) @xcite that turns out to be in a quite fair good agreement with monte carlo data up to @xmath34 @xcite , and a more recent perturbative approach due to yukalov and yukalova @xcite that , however , distances itself from monte carlo data for just lower values of @xmath0 .    by adding successive powers at the mean - field prediction of bogoliubov with the lhk perturbative correction , we have fit our data with the expression @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 the best values for the parameters coming from the fit of the pigs data are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the resulting curve of @xmath41 is also reported as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ liquid ] .    by increasing the gas parameter the system spontaneously breaks the translational invariance due to the effect of the increased correlations among the particles , resulting in a solid phase , as inferred also from the characteristic oscillations in the pair correlation function @xmath42 reported in fig .",
    "the emerging crystal is the fcc , that is the lattice that best fits the cubic geometry of the simulation box .",
    "very recent pimc simulations @xcite have shown , however , that the free energy difference between the two closed packed crystals , fcc and hcp , for the quantum hs , is vanishing small .",
    "this is not surprising since the difference in these two lattices arises from the second shell of neighbors , and the hs potential is short ranged . in fig .",
    "[ solid ] we report the resulting energy per particles @xmath33 as a function of the gas parameter . even in this case , we find a quite good agreement with older gfmc data @xcite .",

    "[ solid ] .    by using the polynomial fit to the pigs data ( [ liq_fit ] ) and ( [ sol_fit ] ) it is possible to locate the transition region between the gas and the solid phase via the standard maxwell ( double tangent ) construction .",
    "we find that the coexistence region is bounded by @xmath50 ( freezing gas parameter ) and @xmath51 ( melting gas parameter ) .",
    "these values are close , but not perfectly compatible , with the older gfmc results @xcite @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the shift to higher values for the bounding gas parameters can be due to a greater accuracy of the imaginary time propagator used here @xcite .",
    "another source of difference can be the strong dependence of such bounding values on the different used fitting formula , even if the energies @xmath33 obtained with the two exact monte carlo methods are very close ( as one expects from exact techniques ) .",
