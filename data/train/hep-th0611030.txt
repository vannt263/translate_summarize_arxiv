    "unification of electroweak and strong interaction couplings@xcite , at a precise energy scale@xcite , is the main information we have about physics at energies much larger than @xmath1 . given how elementary particles fit multiplets of a unified gauge group , it is natural to conclude that such unification is not an accident , but a crucial feature of nature , that should be explained , rather then merely reproduced , by an extension of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "many attempts have been devoted to the construction of unified models , in a field theory@xcite scenario , even in presence of one@xcite or two@xcite extra dimensions , as well as in string model building ( for recent realistic constructions see@xcite ) . in the latter ,",
    "large gauge groups naturally arise , and a unified description of gauge and gravity interactions is also possible . in all the models a key feature is the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism , and in this paper we focus on such an issue : our main aim is the study of the mechanism due to the presence of orbifold projections in ( toroidal ) orbifold models .",
    "we avoid a complete discussion of other symmetry breaking mechanisms , such as the one realized by continuous wilson lines or by higgs - like effects , as well as the kind of gauge symmetry breaking due to magnetic fluxes for the gauge fields or , in a dual picture , the one due to the presence of angles between d - branes in open string model building .",
    "we distinguish between two different options , characterized by the details of the orbifold projection .",
    "namely , it may act in the internal space as a _ rotation _ ( with fixed points ) or as a _ rototranslation _ ( without fixed points i.e. _ freely _ ) .",
    "in the _ rotational _ case the breaking is _ localized _ in the fixed points and , generically , there is no scale of breaking : the coupling constants of the unbroken gauge factors ( namely , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) run in different ways at all the energies .",
    "this implies that the unification of the couplings can be at best numerically reproduced , but not explained .    in the _ rototranslational _ case",
    "the breaking is _ non - local_@xcite .",
    "this implies that the couplings run in the same unified way between the high energy cutoff of the model ( string scale ) and an intermediate scale , related to the compactification scales .",
    "then , from this scale down to low energy , the three couplings run in different ways , and so they split apart from each other@xcite .",
    "it is very natural to define such an intermediate scale as the symmetry breaking scale of the model .",
    "the presence of such a scale is crucial in heterotic string model building , where the string scale is typically larger than the `` observed '' unification scale @xmath5@xcite : the hierarchy @xmath6 can be introduced via a compactification scale smaller then @xmath7 , rather then by appealing to large threshold corrections at the string scale@xcite hierarchy see also@xcite . ] .",
    "we mainly focus on non - local breaking , describing its details in nontrivial compactifications . since an orbifold model with a single orbifold operator / projection is an over - simplified system , we extend the analysis to orbifold models with enlarged orbifold group . in this case",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking is non - local only provided that all the gauge - symmetry - breaking orbifold operators have a free action@xcite .",
    "such a requirement imposes severe constraints on the allowed orbifolds / geometries ; we review those described in@xcite , relevant in string model building .",
    "the complication of having many orbifold operators has a relevant extra consequence .",
    "namely , it ensures the absence of continues wilson lines mimicking the kind of gauge symmetry breaking we are interested in , i.e. it ensures that the symmetry breaking scale is completely fixed by the compactification moduli .",
    "the mechanism is then peculiarly different from the hosotani mechanism , where an extra continuous parameter , other than the compactification scale , can be tuned to fix the breaking scale , exactly as in the standard higgs mechanism . in this sense ,",
    "the mechanism combines the absence of extra continuous parameters , typical of discrete wilson lines breaking , with the presence of a breaking scale , typical of hosotani / higgs mechanism .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following + in sect .",
    "2 we consider field theory examples , in presence of two extra dimensions compactified on orbifolds .",
    "we first study two simplified models , one with rotational action , the other with rototranslational action , computing the running of the coupling constants .",
    "we show that only in the rototranslational case it is possible to have unification of the couplings at the compactification scale and unified running of the couplings between this scale and the cutoff .",
    "we extend the study to a third model with non - local breaking , discussed in@xcite and relevant also in@xcite .",
    "we compute the symmetry breaking scale , finding its exact relation with the surface of the two - dimensional space .",
    "we also show the absence of continuous wilson lines mimicking the non - local gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , we extend the results to generic orbifolds , and comment about the gauge symmetry breaking due to discrete wilson lines .",
    "we show that in the latter case a scale of breaking is present only in _ very specific _ constructions and is absent in the general case .    in sect .",
    "3 we study 6d orbifold geometries , relevant in string model building since type i and heterotic string compactifications on such backgrounds produce 4d @xmath0 susy models with non - local gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "we comment about the details of open string model building@xcite .",
    "we remind that , in presence of stacks of dp - branes with @xmath8 , the orbifold action can be _ external _ to the stacks , i.e. it can identify different stacks of d - branes . in this case",
    "the symmetry breaking reduces the rank of the gauge group .",
    "we comment about a purely external orbifold action , irrelevant for our purposes , a purely internal action , producing models with features close to the heterotic ones , and finally we address the issue of a mixed internal and external action .",
    "we show that in this case the combination of a rank - reducing orbifold with a discrete wilson line can produce a model with gauge coupling unification at a scale fixed by the compactification scale .    *",
