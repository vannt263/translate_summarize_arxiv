    "the 21  cm signal from neutral hydrogen has the potential to provide a direct and independent probe of the cosmological gas distribution and its thermal and ionization states before and during reionization .",
    "indirectly , such observations can be used to study the formation and evolution of early luminous sources , their feedback on the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and their impact on the formation of subsequent generations of structures . as the 21  cm line",
    "is associated with the hyperfine transition in the ground state of neutral hydrogen , it depends on the distribution of atoms in these two energy levels , which is quantified by the spin temperature @xmath2 . since all the atoms are immersed in a sea of cmb radiation , in principle they can absorb or emit photons with the frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two hyperfine levels , @xmath3 , possibly changing the shape of the cmb spectrum itself .",
    "if only cmb photons are present , absorption and emission equilibrate in a short time , and no line will be visible . however , there are other two mechanisms that can change the spin states of neutral hydrogen atoms  collisions and @xmath0 excitation ( wouthuysen - field effect , @xcite ) , which render the 21  cm line visible in emission ( @xmath4 ) or absorption ( @xmath5 ) against the cmb background ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 21  cm signal from the high redshift universe has been studied in relation to minihalos ( @xcite ) and the igm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "prior to the formation of radiation sources , the igm is cold and neutral and the 21  cm line is expected to be observed in absorption against the cmb .",
    "observations of the 21  cm signal at these very high redshifts would provide a wealth of information about the initial density fluctuations and the presence of a running spectral index or deviations from gaussianity ( @xcite ) .",
    "once the ionization sources turn on , they affect the 21  cm signal both by reducing the amount of neutral hydrogen and by increasing the temperature of the igm though photoheating , @xmath0 photon scattering and , if the sources are hard enough , x - ray heating @xcite .",
    "eventually , such heating renders the igm visible in emission .",
    "a 21  cm signal is also expected from minihalos ( mhs ) , collapsed structures with masses larger than the jeans mass and smaller than the mass corresponding to a virial temperature of @xmath6 . in such halos , the gas can not cool efficiently unless a large fraction of molecular hydrogen is present .",
    "this , together with their fragility with respect to feedback effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) makes their contribution to star formation and photon production small at best .",
    "nevertheless , mhs are expected to form copiously throughout cosmic history and their detection would be an observational breakthrough . it has been suggested that a possible way of detecting mhs is via the 21  cm line ( @xcite ) . because of their high density and temperature , mhs result in a signal that is expected to be different from that of the igm . on one hand ,",
    "collisions are frequent in such halos , coupling @xmath2 to the gas temperature ; on the other hand , the very dense gas can trap ionization fronts , protecting their central regions from being ionized .",
    "this makes mhs a possibly significant or even dominant source of 21  cm emission at some stage of cosmic history .    as mhs",
    "are expected to be found preferentially in high density regions , they are more likely to absorb uv radiation produced by nearby sources and get progressively photoevaporated ( @xcite ) . as a consequence , they can deplete the number of ionizing photons and delay igm reionization .",
    "in addition to photoionization , mh formation and evolution is affected by a variety of feedback effects ( see @xcite for a complete review ) , whose relative importance has not been clearly established yet .",
    "* c06 hereafter ) performed the first simulations of reionization with a self - consistent treatment of mh photoevaporation , finding that , depending on the strength of the feedback effects , the presence of mhs could delay the end of reionization by as much as @xmath7 . in this paper , we use the results of these simulations to study the 21  cm signal from both the igm and minihalos .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ methods ]",
    "we give a short description of the c06 simulations and the method used to calculate the 21  cm signal from the igm and the mhs . in section [ results ] we present our results and discuss their uncertainties . in section [ con ] we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the method used to derive the 21  cm signal from the igm and the mhs .      here",
    "we give a short description of the simulation run in c06 .",
    "readers can find more details in the original paper and references therein .",
    "the underlying n - body simulation was run in a cubic box of comoving length @xmath8 , which was extracted and resimulated from a much larger region @xcite .",
    "galaxy formation was followed with a semi - analytic model @xcite and radiative transfer was calculated with the code crash @xcite , with the assumption that the gas follows the dark matter .",
    "this distribution was then mapped on a @xmath9 grid , using the triangular shaped cloud interpolation ( @xcite ) to get the density in each cell . throughout the simulation ,",
    "the @xcite transfer function was used and the cosmology was taken to be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mean matter , vacuum , and baryonic densities in units of the critical density , @xmath14 is the hubble constant in units of 100 kms@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 is the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations on the 8 mpc h@xmath15 scale , and @xmath17 is the slope of the primordial power spectrum .    unlike the original simulations by @xcite and @xcite , in c06 sub - grid physics was included to take into account the effects of mhs on reionization . generally speaking , the box size of a reionization simulation should be large enough to be representative of the whole universe .",
    "this requirement makes it impractical to resolve individual minihalos ( whose mass may be as small as @xmath18  m@xmath19 ) . for this reason , c06 used a `` sub - grid correction '' to include their effects on reionization , which are mainly due to two issues :    \\1 ) gas accretion onto mhs , which reduces the density of the igm ;    \\2 )",
    "mhs absorption of photons that would otherwise ionize the igm .",
    "because of their high gas density and recombination rate , mhs can consume many more photons than the igm , relative to their overall mass fraction .    to take into account the above effects , at each step of the simulation in c06 ,",
    "the following `` sub - grid correction '' was applied :    * in each cell , the total mass of mhs was calculated using the extended press - schechter ( eps ) theory @xcite , and the igm density was corrected accordingly . * the number of ionizing photons absorbed by mhs in each cell was taken to be : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the optical depth of mhs , which is proportional to the mass fraction of mhs @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the number of photons injected into this cell . * at each step , the fraction of minihalos photoevaporated was computed as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hydrogen number density , @xmath26 is the size of one cell , while @xmath27 is the average number of photons consumed by minihalos per total atom ( the expressions can be found in the original paper ) .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the detailed effect of feedback on mh formation and evolution is still unknown .",
    "for this reason c06 have considered two extreme models in the simulations .",
    "the first is the extreme suppression ( es ) model , in which once a cell has been crossed by an ionizing photon , no new halos are allowed to form within it unless it recombines to become completely neutral .",
    "the second is the reformation model ( re ) , in which mhs continue to form undisturbed by feedback effects .",
    "the real situation is expected to lie between these two extreme cases .",
    "the differential brightness temperature @xmath28 of the igm is calculated following @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30^{1/2 } , \\label{t_igm}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 ionization fraction .",
    "this formula is accurate only in the optically thin limit , which is appropriate for the igm .",
    "@xmath2 is the spin temperature , which determines the distribution of neutral hydrogen atoms in the two hyperfine levels .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is a weighted mean between the cmb temperature , @xmath32 , and the gas kinetic temperature , @xmath33 , and depends on the effect of collisions and @xmath0 pumping . in this work",
    "we use @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the collisional coupling efficiency ( including h - h , h - e@xmath36 and h - p collisions ; see @xcite ) , and @xmath37 is an effective ly@xmath38 coupling efficiency term that can be written as @xcite : @xmath39\\left(1+\\frac{0.4}{t_k}\\right)^{-1 } , \\label{yalpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the standard @xmath0 coupling efficiency @xcite .",
    "the igm temperature in the absence of heating mechanisms has been calculated using recfast ( @xcite , 2000 ) .",
    "typically , the igm can be found in three thermal states , which define the value of the differential brightness temperature , as listed below :    \\1 ) _ no heating .",
    "_ in this state , which occurs before and during the early stages of structure evolution , the igm cools adiabatically .",
    "as long as the density of neutral hydrogen is high enough , collisions between different atoms couple @xmath2 to @xmath33 , which is usually lower than @xmath32 at that stage , so that the 21  cm signal is in absorption . however , following the expansion of the universe , the density decreases as @xmath41 , so that collisional coupling becomes ineffective below @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", the spin temperature is only slightly smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "\\2 ) _ @xmath43 and uv photon heating_. once the first sources of radiation turn on , their uv photons start to ionize and heat the surrounding gas .",
    "while their impact is limited to the regions in the immediate vicinity of the sources , the @xmath43 photons ( both continuum and injected ; see @xcite ) can travel much further from their production sites because of the longer mean free path compared to uv photons , and quickly build up a background that can influence the igm as a whole .",
    "the @xmath43 photons have a double effect on the spin temperature .",
    "first , even a small @xmath0 intensity ( @xmath44 ) can make @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ yalpha ] ) much larger than 1 and bring @xmath2 very close to @xmath33 , so that the spin temperature traces the state of the igm .",
    "this effect is typically referred to as @xmath0 coupling or the wouthuysen - field effect .",
    "secondly , @xmath43 photons can heat or cool the igm slightly by resonance scattering , as has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite find lower values than originally estimated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it may still have some impact on the thermal evolution of the igm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate this effect with the @xmath43 background derived in @xcite , which is self - consistent with the simulation of c06 .",
    "figure [ fig.tem ] shows the temperature evolution of a homogeneous cosmic density field .",
    "the dashed - dotted line is the spin temperature without any heating mechanisms , while the dotted line is the spin temperature used in our @xmath43 heating case .",
    "both estimates exclude the photoionization heating . with the adopted @xmath43 flux background ,",
    "the temperature of the igm is never higher than @xmath32 before the end of reionization .",
    "thus , as @xmath43 heating is not extremely efficient , we expect a 21  cm signal in absorption .",
    "\\3 ) _ strong heating_. finally , when the @xmath0 background becomes strong enough or additional sources of heating are present , we expect the temperature @xmath33 to become much larger than @xmath32 .",
    "such high temperatures could be reached in the presence of x - rays , that can heat the igm above 1000  k @xcite .",
    "although there are still some uncertainties on the extent of the x - ray background , it seems plausible to have @xmath46 at later times during cosmic evolution . in this situation ,",
    "the 21  cm signal is always in emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to x - rays , ly@xmath38 and uv photons , shocks due to structure formation can also heat the igm @xcite .",
    "shock heating may be significant if the gas is still cold at high redshift @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that even taking into account shock heating , the 21  cm signal from mhs is still larger than that from the igm at @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , shock heating usually is efficient around large halos or in high density regions .",
    "the same regions however are also likely to be ionized by nearby sources .",
    "this may suppress the effect of heating by shocks .",
    "also , c06 did not consider shock heating because they assumed the gas to trace the dark matter distribution .",
    "so this contribution is not considered further in the present work .",
    "the details about the transition between these three configurations are still not clear , mainly because of our persistent ignorance on the details associated with the heating mechanism . here",
    ", we estimate the 21  cm signal in three heating case : pure uv heating , ly@xmath38 and uv heating and strong heating .",
    "the uv heating is treated as did in the simulation by c06 .      in principle , the differential brightness temperature of mhs can be derived by replacing @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ t_igm ] ) with : @xmath49^{1/2 } , \\label{t_mh}\\ ] ] which is proportional to the mass fraction of mhs .    however , this formula is valid only in the optically - thin case , while the optical depth of an individual minihalo is usually large .",
    "in fact , for a halo with mass @xmath18  m@xmath19 , the typical value of the optical depth along a line - of - sight across the center of the halo is @xmath50 @xcite , and it drops as the mass increases because of the high @xmath2 and the low absorption coefficient of high mass halos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite give the more appropriate result of 21  cm flux and @xmath28 for an optically - thick case , assuming that the halo is a truncated isothermal sphere ( tis ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we make use of their results .    because of their high density and temperature ( compared with @xmath32 ) , individual mhs",
    "are expected to always produce a 21  cm signal in emission @xcite , with a large @xmath28 ( in fig .",
    "1 of @xcite , the typical value is several hundred mk at frequency @xmath51 , and even larger after integration along the line profile ) .",
    "however , it is extremely difficult to resolve individual halos , because their angular size is usually less than @xmath52 . for this reason it is customary to estimate , rather than the signal from individual halos , the beam - averaged effective differential brightness temperature as ( eq .  ( 6 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass function of minihalos and @xmath55 is the hubble parameter . here",
    "we take the jeans mass as the lower mass limit , which is @xmath56^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left[\\frac{\\omega_hb^2}{0.02}\\right]^{-\\frac{3}{5}}\\left(\\frac{1+z}{10}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2 } } , \\label{mmin}\\ ] ] as in @xcite .",
    "the upper mass limit is @xmath57 , which corresponds to @xmath58  k in our cosmology .",
    "@xmath59 is the geometric cross section of a halo , where @xmath60 is the truncated radius in the tis model @xcite ; @xmath61/(1+z)$ ] is the redshifted effective line width and @xmath62 is the differential brightness temperature of a single halo at the frequency @xmath63 ( the detailed expressions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "while @xmath54 can be derived from a press - schechter approach , in this case , we need also to account for photoevaporation of the mhs .",
    "while the simulations described in section  [ methods ] provide the total mhs mass fraction in each cell at any given time , we have no information on the distribution of mass amongst the mhs .",
    "we thus proceed as follows . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the mass evolution of an individual halo exposed to a flux @xmath64\\}}$ ] , with an initial mass @xmath65 at redshift @xmath66 , is a function @xmath67 .",
    "the function can be inverted to derive @xmath68 , i.e. from the mass of a halo we can get the mass of its progenitor .",
    "then , at any redshift and in any given cell , the minihalo mass function , including photoevaporation , can be written as : @xmath69 here , @xmath70 is the redshift at which a photon packet crosses the cell for the first time and @xmath71 .",
    "the first term of the equation takes into account the evolution of the mass function due to all the halos forming between @xmath70 and @xmath72 , while the second term describes the evolution in the mass function of halos already in place at @xmath70 .",
    "both @xmath73 and @xmath74 are calculated with the eps theory , following c06 .",
    "the equation above is valid in the reformation case , while in the extreme suppression model , once a cell has been crossed by ionizing photons , no new halo can form . in this case , the first term of the equation should be set to zero .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the mass photoevaporation law of @xcite , which is : @xmath75 in this equation , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are parameters determined by the spectrum of the sources . in our case @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the evaporation time @xmath80 is a function of @xmath81 and of the source spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig.haloeva ] shows the mass evolution of individual halos with different initial masses , @xmath65 , at @xmath82 , exposed to various constant fluxes of @xmath83= 0.01 , 1 , and 1000 .",
    "while low - mass halos disappear on very short time scales ( @xmath8414  myrs if @xmath85 and @xmath86  m@xmath19 ) , larger mass halos retain most of their mass . for example , with @xmath85 , a halo with @xmath87  m@xmath19 will have a mass @xmath88  m@xmath19 after 126  myrs , i.e. has undergone a mass loss of only 40% .    in principle , if the flux evolution in each cell is known , it is possible to re - construct the mass evaporation process for halos in each mass bin according to eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) . in c06",
    ", the flux is determined by sources in the simulation box @xcite . however , as it is computationally unfeasible to record the value of @xmath83 in each cell at each timestep of the simulation , we only recorded the total evaporated mass fraction of minihalos in each cell .",
    "we then adopt an effective ionization flux which gives identical evaporated mass fraction as @xmath83 , to calculate the mass evolution of halos with different mass .",
    "two methods are used to get the effective flux and implement eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) . in the first , in each cell and at each time step of the simulation , @xmath89 , we use an effective ionization flux , @xmath90 , which is assumed to be constant between @xmath70 and @xmath89 .",
    "as we know the total mass of mhs in the cell , @xmath91 , we use the following equation : @xmath92 where the sum is performed over all the mhs in the cell .",
    "the above equation is solved to derive the only unknown quantity @xmath90 , which is then used in eq .",
    "( [ newmf ] ) to calculate the re - distributed mh mass function and @xmath93 . at the following time step",
    ", the same process is repeated to derive a new effective flux .    in the second method , we also choose an effective flux for each cell .",
    "differently from the first method , here the effective flux evolves step by step , rather than being constant from @xmath70 to @xmath89 . at each time step ,",
    "@xmath89 , we calculate : @xmath94 where : @xmath95 , \\label{dm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the mass of minihalo @xmath96 evaporated between two steps . from the above equations we derive the only unknown quantity , @xmath90 and then we use it in eq .",
    "( [ newmf ] ) to calculate the re - distributed mh mass function and @xmath93 .",
    "also , the same process is repeated to derive a new effective flux at the following time step .",
    "we have used both methods and found that the results are consistent with each other , as in the vast majority of cells at any time the difference in the @xmath28 obtained with the two methods is less than 5% .",
    "thus , in the following we will always use the first one .",
    "figure [ fig.newmf ] instead shows the mass function at different redshifts with the assumption of a constant ionization flux @xmath85 , as calculated in eq .",
    "( [ newmf ] ) .",
    "the thin lines refer to the extreme suppression model , while the thick lines are the reformation model .",
    "as expected , the mass function in the reformation model is always larger than that in the extreme suppression model . in the former , at high mass end ,",
    "the formation rate of halos is higher than the evaporation rate , so the mass function increases with time .    using the above mass functions , we can now calculate the expected differential brightness temperature .",
    "figure [ fig.dt_mh ] shows the mean ( volume - averaged ) @xmath28 evolution for the two mh formation models , which has been calculated both with the optically - thin formula given in eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) with the assumption that @xmath46 ( dashed lines ) and for the optically - thick case in eq .",
    "( [ dt_mh ] ) ( solid lines ) , with @xmath97 taken from figure  1 of @xcite . although the @xmath28 for an individual halo is very high compared with the optically - thin case , the beam - averaged @xmath93 is very small ( with a typical value of @xmath98 mk ) .",
    "this is because the halos usually have a small geometric cross section @xmath99 , and thus the associated flux is not very significant .",
    "figure [ fig.dt_mh ] also shows that the optically thin assumption with @xmath46 is a good approximation to calculate the mean 21  cm signal from minihalos .",
    "@xmath100 in the extreme suppression model drops dramatically following the evaporation of the minihalos . in the reformation model",
    "instead , it increases continuously until late times .",
    "thus , the presence or absence of mh reformation can result in totally different pictures of the evolution of the 21  cm signal from mhs .",
    "in this section we present our results in terms of mean differential brightness temperature ( as described in secs .  2.2 and  2.3 ) and fluctuations of brightness temperature , and",
    "we discuss their uncertainties . as a visual example , in figure  [ map ] we show maps of the @xmath28 in the pure uv heating case and reformation model .",
    "form top to bottom , the three rows correspond to the igm , mhs , and the total .",
    "the map shows that at the early and late stages of reionization , mhs contribute more to the total signal compared with the igm , while at intermediate redshifts the contribution from partially ionized igm increases .      the contribution from mhs to the mean differential brightness temperature",
    "is calculated as described in the previous section and is shown as dashed - dotted lines in figure  [ fig.dt_nh ] .",
    "the two formation models for mhs ( es and re ) represent two extreme effects of the igm heating on the 21  cm signal from mhs . in each model , the signal of mhs does not vary as a function of igm heating , so these lines are the same as the solid lines in figure  [ fig.dt_mh ] .",
    "@xmath28 from mhs is roughly proportional to the total mass of mhs , while it is not sensitive to the shape of their mass function . on the other hand ,",
    "the igm contribution strongly depends on its thermal state , and we present results for three different cases .",
    "first , we discuss the case in which only heating from ionizing radiation is present . over the redshift range covered by the simulations ,",
    "the collisional coupling in the mean - density igm considered here is very weak .",
    "thus , in the absence of other decoupling mechanisms , the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen is very close to @xmath32 and the 21  cm line is only slightly visible in absorption ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.dt_nh ] ) .",
    "however , as the first sources of radiation turn on and reionization begins , the energy of the ionizing photons heats the igm in the vicinity of the sources to a significant high temperature ( in this work we follow c06 and use the reference value @xmath101k , which is a reasonable approximation in regions ionized by stellar type sources ; see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the igm in such regions may emit 21  cm radiation until it has been fully ionized , so that the mean @xmath28 changes from a negative to a positive value .",
    "however , as reionization proceeds , the amount of neutral hydrogen decreases and the mean @xmath28 drops to zero again .    in the extreme suppression case , we find that even in the presence of only collisional decoupling and uv heating , the 21  cm signal from minihalos dominates the total signal only in the very early stages of reionization .",
    "this is because reionization suppresses the formation of new minihalos and photoevaporates existing ones , reducing their contribution with time . on the other hand",
    ", reionization increases the temperature of the partially - ionized igm and the density of free electrons .",
    "in high temperature , partially ionized regions , h-@xmath102 and h - p collisions are more effective than h - h collisions in coupling @xmath2 to @xmath33 . as a consequence ,",
    "the fraction of flux from partially ionized gas is higher than its volume filling factor , and the signal from the igm increases with time until a volume averaged ionized fraction of @xmath103 has been reached , at @xmath104 , which corresponds to a peak of the emission .    on the other hand , in the reformation model",
    ", the flux from the igm is reduced by the significant value of @xmath105 and pushed towards lower redshift by the delay in the reionization process . in this case , the period during which the flux from minihalos is larger than that from the igm is extended to @xmath106 , and reaches a peak at @xmath107    it should be stressed that the signal from the igm dominates over that from the mhs because of the collisions between atoms and free electrons and protons ( we discuss the uncertainties of this in sec . [ uncer ] ) . in fact , if we ignore this contribution , the peak of @xmath28 from the igm is only @xmath108  mk and the signal from mhs dominates down to @xmath109 in the extreme suppression model , and at almost all redshifts in the reformation model .",
    "next , we consider a case that includes the effects from a @xmath0 background , leading to the mean @xmath28 evolution shown in figure [ fig.dt_hc ] . here",
    "we see that the @xmath0 background produced by the sources in the simulation is strong enough to couple @xmath2 to @xmath33 and to heat the igm above the adiabatic temperature , but the mean temperature is still below @xmath32 .",
    "this induces a strong mean signal in absorption , and a minimal emission is visible only at a late evolutionary stage in the reformation model .",
    "this is because reionization proceeds to lower redshift , when more sources form and produce a larger value of the @xmath0 background . yet even in this case the bulk of the emission is due to the partially - ionized regions .",
    "the reason for the very different behavior compared to the no @xmath0 background case is the following . without @xmath0 photons",
    "the contribution to @xmath28 consists of a small negative signal from the neutral , cold igm ( because @xmath110 ) , and a positive signal from the the partially ionized , hot igm . in the presence of @xmath0 photons instead ,",
    "the dominant contribution comes from a strong negative signal from the the neutral , warm igm ( because @xmath111 ) which exceeds the smaller positive signal from the partially ionized , hot igm . in this case",
    "we find that the igm signal always dominates the total signal consistent with @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider a situation in which @xmath112 resulting in the evolution of the mean @xmath28 shown in figure  [ fig.dt_er ] .",
    "as expected , in this case @xmath28 is always positive and it decreases as reionization proceeds and the available neutral hydrogen is depleted .",
    "unlike the cases analyzed before , the signal corresponding to the extreme suppression model is always lower than that of the reformation model .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in this case , @xmath28 is independent of @xmath2 and depends only on the amount of neutral hydrogen present at each redshift , which is higher in the reformation model .",
    "moreover , the signal from the igm always dominates over that from the mhs .",
    "this is because in both cases the condition @xmath46 is satisfied , meaning that @xmath113 and @xmath114 with a similar constant of proportionality . thus @xmath115 implies @xmath116      we now calculate the rms fluctuations in the brightness temperature distribution , @xmath117 as a function of the beamsize , @xmath118 , and redshift .",
    "we choose a slice corresponding to a bandwidth @xmath119  mhz , located at the center of the simulation box . a larger bandwidth ( e.g. 1  mhz )",
    "would produce lower fluctuations because in that case inhomogeneities in the gas density and in the hydrogen ionized fractions would be more poorly resolved ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig.rms_theta ] and [ fig.rms_z ] , for the three igm thermal states and two mh formation models described in the previous sections .",
    "figure  [ fig.rms_theta ] gives the rms as a function of beamsize at several different redshifts for both the reformation ( upper panels ) and the extreme suppression ( bottom panels ) model .",
    "figure  [ fig.rms_z ] , instead , gives the evolution of rms for different beamsize in the same two models .",
    "in all cases , the signal increases as the angular scale decreases because the mass variance is larger on small scales .",
    "another common feature is that , although the continuous formation of minihalos increases the signal compared to the extreme suppression case , it does not increase the inhomogeneity of the gas , so the rms in the reformation model is similar to the rms of the extreme suppression model until the latter drops because of reionization .    in the pure uv heating case ,",
    "the signal from the igm reaches a maximum at @xmath120 ( extreme suppression model ) and at @xmath121 ( reformation model ) , corresponding to the epoch when several neutral regions are still present , but the volume is roughly half ionized .",
    "then it starts decreasing and drops dramatically when the igm gets close to complete reionization .",
    "the signal from the mhs shows a similar behavior , but in the reformation model the drop associated with photoevaporation is not evident because they are allowed to continuously reform .",
    "the general trend in the relative importance of the igm and mhs contribution follows what already seen in the mean brightness temperature , i.e. the mhs contribution dominates in both models in the earliest stages of the evolution and when reionization is almost complete in the reformation model .",
    "otherwise the igm contribution is dominant .",
    "in addition , the smaller the beamsize , the earlier the fluctuations that from igm exceed those from the mhs because this corresponds to the size of one cell in the simulation . ] .",
    "thus , increasing the resolution of the beam might not help in detecting the signal from mhs ( because observations at higher redshift and lower frequencies are more difficult ) , unless one chooses a region particularly rich in mhs .",
    "also in the @xmath46 case and in the ly@xmath38 case , the behavior of the rms is similar to that of the mean brightness temperature , with the mh signal dominating only in the reformation model during the latest stages of reionization .",
    "we then calculate the pixel distribution of the brightness temperature , @xmath122 , as a function of @xmath28 for the igm in the three cases and minihalos . here",
    "@xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the total number of cells in the simulation box and @xmath125 is the number of cells that lie in the bin @xmath126 . in figure [ fig.pixel_er ] and [ fig.pixel_f ]",
    "the panels correspond , from left to right and from top to bottom , to pure uv heating case , ly@xmath127 heating case , @xmath128 case and minihalos , respectively .",
    "the amplitude of the pixel distribution indicates the relative contributions from different @xmath28 bins to the total signal .",
    "the double peaks associated with the two - phase structure of the igm ( totally neutral and partially ionized regions ) are very prominent ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the ly@xmath38 heating case , at an early stage ( dashed lines ) , when most of the signal comes from completely neutral regions , only one peak is visible in absorption , corresponding to @xmath129  mk .",
    "however , as ionization proceeds , the amplitude of the peak decreases and moves toward a positive value ; meanwhile , a new , smaller peak appears with positive value at @xmath130 several mk , which comes from the partially ionized regions ( see the dashed and dashed - dotted lines in fig .  [ fig.pixel_er ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.pixel_f ] ) .",
    "the three redshifts chosen show three typical situations : when the totally neutral regions dominate , when the partially ionized regions begin to produce a significant signal and when the contribution from partially ionized regions is more evident , respectively .",
    "the behavior of the pixel distribution is very similar for the extreme suppression and the reformation model , the only difference being a delay in the reformation model . in the @xmath46 case ,",
    "the trend is the same as in the ly@xmath38 heating case , i.e. as ionization proceeds , the peak corresponding to the totally neutral regions decreases and moves toward zero , while the peak originating from the partially ionized regions increases .",
    "however , the situation is slightly different in the pure uv heating case , in which the contributions from the partially ionized regions become significant at an earlier stage .",
    "finally , the dominant minihalo contribution at all redshifts comes from cells with @xmath131  1 - 2  mk , which is a typical value of beam - averaged differential brightness temperature in our simulation ( this value depends on the cosmological parameters and the matter power spectrum , see @xcite ) .",
    "unlike the igm signal , here there is always only one peak ; however , since we can measure only a total flux , this feature is not useful to distinguish the signal of minihalos from that of the igm .",
    "the sawtooth features come from the discreteness effect introduced when calculating @xmath132 , which shows also in the spikes of the igm signal .      in this section",
    "we discuss the main approximations and uncertainties of our model and their impact on the results , in addition to those already discussed in c06 .",
    "* in the pure uv heating case , partially ionized regions contribute significantly to the emission signal .",
    "however , we note that the resolution of our simulation is only @xmath84  223  kpc , which is not enough to resolve the i - front .",
    "this leads to the possibility of overestimating the signal from partially ionized regions by mixing together totally ionized and totally neutral regions .",
    "in fact there are many uncertainties related to the sub - grid neutral filling factor , including the inhomogeneity of the density field on small scales and the spectrum of the sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ in our work we refer to `` partially ionized '' cells as regions heated by uv photons that still contain enough neutral hydrogen to emit a 21  cm signal .",
    "note that this somewhat arbitrary definition is used only to estimate the relative contribution of gas in different physical conditions , while all the cells in the simulation have been used to calculate the total 21  cm signal . in all our previous calculations",
    ", we identified partially ionized cells as those with ionization fraction @xmath31 above a threshold value of 0.1 , but a value of 0.01 leads to similar results .",
    "if @xmath31 is very close to 1.0 , the signal from a cell is negligible and the cell is referred to as totally ionized .",
    "+ if we assume that in a partially ionized cell only a fraction @xmath133 of the gas is partially ionized with an ionization fraction of @xmath134 , while the rest is either neutral and cold , or ionized and hot and thus irrelevant for the contribution from the partially ionized regions .",
    "furthermore , we should consider that only a fraction of gas @xmath135 is contributing to the signal .",
    "both @xmath133 and @xmath134 are unknown , and vary in a large range cell by cell . as a reference ,",
    "if we assume @xmath136 we find that at the redshift when half of the gas has been ionized , the mean @xmath137 of the total simulation volume for @xmath133 equal to ( 0.0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 1.0 ) are ( -0.054 , -0.051 , -0.012 , 0.21 , 5.63 )  mk respectively for the extreme suppression case . note that @xmath138 corresponds to the peak of the dashed line in upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.dt_nh ] .",
    "+ so if the sub - grid neutral filling factor is much lower than 1.0 , we expect no emission mean signal or non - dominant partially ionized igm signal in the pure uv heating case",
    ". however , the pure uv heating model ignores the pre - heating by x - rays and ly@xmath38 photons , thus we expect it to be appropriate to describe only the early stages of reionization .",
    "also the small emission in the @xmath139 coupling case suffers from this uncertainty , although our main trends and conclusions will not change .",
    "finally , in the strong heating case , the influence of resolution should be negligible .",
    "this is natural since in those two models , the dominant signal is from the neutral gas .",
    "* to derive the mass evolution of mhs undergoing photoevaporation we use the fitting formula by @xcite .",
    "the formula reproduces the results from their numerical simulation , but it is approximate .",
    "moreover , it is accurate only for a constant ionization flux , while in the simulations by c06 , the flux assumes different values at different times and locations .",
    "we tried two different methods to derive eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) in the presence of a time dependent flux , corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ mi ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) , which consistently predict the @xmath137 within few percent . as in c06 , for most halos , the evaporation time is comparable or smaller than the time between two outputs ( for example , in the extreme suppression model @xmath84 66% of the cells lose 80% of their mh mass between two outputs ) .",
    "we also do not expect the use of those formulae to introduce uncertainties in addition to those already present in the c06 implementation . * to calculate the 21  cm flux from an individual minihalo we use the formula from @xcite and then we integrate over the mass function in eq .",
    "( [ newmf ] ) to obtain the beam - averaged effective differential brightness temperature of eq .",
    "( [ dt_mh ] ) .",
    "this formula is only suitable for halos that are in post - collapse equilibrium with a tis profile . yet ,",
    "when a halo is being photoevaporated , both its density and temperature profile may be substantially different .",
    "the new profile should depend on the local ionization flux .",
    "if we define the dynamical timescale as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the halo circular velocity , for a halo with mass @xmath142  m@xmath19 at redshift 15 , @xmath143 myr while @xmath144 myr if @xmath85 .",
    "so the timescales are comparable and the halo profile could be changed during photoevaporation .",
    "in fact , also @xcite notice that the typical evaporation time is long enough to see a gas - dynamic back - reaction . since the effects of this change on the 21  cm signal of mhs is still not clear , we ignore the effect in this work .",
    "in addition , heating of the igm can also change the profile of a halo , make it less concentrated and thus increase the 21  cm signal @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the equation @xmath46 will always be satisfied , so the impact of the temperature change on the 21  cm signal should be much less than that of the change on the density profile .",
    "we have studied the 21  cm signal from both the igm and minihalos based on the reionization simulations run by @xcite .",
    "these include a `` sub - grid '' prescription to take into account the photoevaporation of mhs in two different models for their formation ( extreme suppression and reformation ) .",
    "our estimates follow the changes in the mass function of mhs and consider three heating case of the igm .",
    "we find that :    * the 21  cm signal tightly relates to the thermal history of the igm .",
    "in all the three configurations ( heating purely by the uv photons , ly@xmath38 and uv heating , and strong heating ) , the igm dominates the 21  cm signal at almost all redshifts , except at a very early stage when the gas is still cold and a ly@xmath38 background has not been constructed or at the end of reionization in the reformation model , when almost all the remaining neutral gas is in mhs .",
    "the small contribution of minihalos to the total 21  cm flux is partially due to the fact that the collapsed fraction of mhs is relatively small at high redshift .",
    "minihalos are significant emission sources in the absence of igm heating , however , in partially ionized regions which are heated by uv photons , where there is enough residual neutral gas and the temperature is much larger than @xmath32 , the igm also provides a contribution to the emission signal . in the presence of a ly@xmath38 background",
    ", neutral gas will be visible in strong absorption until a later stage when neutral regions are rare .",
    "in such case , totally neutral regions contribute more than partially ionized regions and mhs to the total 21  cm signal .",
    "* although mhs are directly visible in 21  cm signal only under particular circumstances , they nevertheless play a significant role in affecting the ionization state of the igm and the corresponding 21  cm flux .",
    "their presence can delay reionization by as much as @xmath145 , depending on the effect of feedback on their formation ( c06 ) .",
    "more specifically , in the pure uv heating case , the 21  cm signal from the igm in the reformation model is weaker than that in extreme suppression model at the same redshift , since mhs delay the photoheating associated with reionization . in the strong heating case on the other hand , the 21",
    "cm emission is higher in the reformation model than in the extreme suppression model at the same redshift , because absorption from mhs leaves more neutral gas in the igm .",
    "this difference shows that in the pure uv heating case , the temperature is the most important factor which can impact the @xmath28 of the igm , while in the strong heating case the most important factor is @xmath146 .",
    "* while the 21 cm signal from mhs exhibits differences from the igm signal , including the pixel distribution , detecting such features will not be within the capabilities of the planned generation of radio telescopes ( e.g. lofar , mwa , 21cma ) . in principle , mhs are more abundant in rich cluster regions , which implies a higher 21  cm signal . in practice , in these regions also contain more ionizing sources that suppress mhs formation and evolution , reducing their signal .",
    "conclusions similar to those derived from our simulations have been reached by previous analytic estimates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated the signal from both the igm and the minihalos , using a semi - analytic approach that includes the x - ray heating and feedback effects on halo formation .",
    "they found that in the presence of wouthuysen - field coupling , mhs are always buried by the igm signal , even if the ly@xmath38 background is small . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite concluded that before reionization but after @xmath147 , ignoring the radiative processes but taking into account shock heating , minihalos could dominate the total signal .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with our pure uv heating case at the early stage .",
