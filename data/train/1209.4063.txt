    "numerical models of dynamic twisted magnetospheres of magnetars ( parfrey et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) show how the twist creates spindown anomalies and initiates giant flares when the magnetosphere is `` overtwisted '' and loses equilibrium .",
    "free energy stored in the magnetospheric twist is gradually dissipated through the continual electron - positron discharge that sustains the electric current . as a result",
    ", the magnetosphere tends to `` untwist '' on the characteristic ohmic timescale of a few years .",
    "electrodynamics of untwisting is quite peculiar : whenever the crustal motions stop or slow down , the electric currents tend to be quickly removed from the magnetospheric field lines with small apex radii @xmath4 ( beloborodov 2009 ) .",
    "currents have longest lifetimes on field lines with @xmath5 ( where @xmath6  km is the star radius ) and form an extended `` j - bundle '' ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the j - bundle has a sharp boundary , which gradually shrinks toward the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "in particular , the footprint of the j - bundle on the neutron star surface , which may be observed as a hot spot , shrinks with time . shrinking hot spots were indeed reported in `` transient magnetars '' whose magnetospheres were temporarily activated and then gradually relaxed back to the quiescent state ( see figure  5 in beloborodov 2011a and refs . therein ) .",
    "the j - bundle must be filled with relativistic plasma that carries the electric current @xmath7 .",
    "the plasma is continually created by @xmath0 discharge near the star and must expand along the extended field lines .",
    "the plasma emits persistent nonthermal emission , converting the dissipated twist energy to radiation . in the accompanying paper ( beloborodov 2013 )",
    ", we calculate the spectrum of produced radiation and show that it forms the observed hard x - ray component with a peak around 1  mev .",
    "the present paper studies in more detail the dynamics of the @xmath0 plasma .",
    "previously , semi - transparent plasma flows around magnetars were invoked to explain the deviation of the observed 1 - 10  kev emission from a thermal spectrum ( thompson et al .",
    "it was usually assumed that the magnetar corona is filled with positive and negative charges that are counter - streaming with mildly relativistic speeds .",
    "the counter - streaming picture was motivated by the fact that electric current @xmath8 must flow along the twisted magnetic field lines .",
    "the coronal plasma must be nearly neutral ; it can easily carry the required current if the opposite charges with densities @xmath9 flow in the opposite directions , so that @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the velocities @xmath12 are free parameters in this phenomenological model , which may be adjusted so that resonant scattering of thermal x - rays in the corona reproduces the 1 - 10  kev part of the magnetar spectrum ( e.g. fernndez & thompson 2007 ; nobili et al . 2008 ; rea et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the counter - streaming model has , however , a problem .",
    "note that the thermal radiation of the magnetar ( @xmath13  kev ) is resonantly scattered at large radii @xmath14  km where @xmath15  g. in this region , the plasma is strongly pushed by radiation away from the star and the counter - streaming model needs an electric field @xmath16 that forces charges of the right sign to move toward the star against the radiative drag . at the same time , the electric field acts on the opposite charges and accelerates them away from the star , cooperating with the radiative push . in the presence of @xmath0 plasma ( which is inevitably created near magnetars )",
    ", the outward acceleration generates relativistic particles , and no self - consistent solution exists for the mildly - relativistic counter - streaming model .    in this paper ( and the accompanying paper beloborodov ( 2013 ) ) , we develop a different picture of plasma circulation in the magnetar corona .",
    "it is schematically shown in figure  2 .",
    "the outer corona is inevitably filled with @xmath0 pair plasma of a high density @xmath17 , which is larger than @xmath18 by the `` multiplicity factor '' @xmath19 ; in this respect it resembles the flow along the open field lines of a rapidly rotating , strongly magnetized neutron star ( e.g. hibschman & arons 2001 ; thompson 2008a ; medin & lai 2010 ) .",
    "pairs are created in the `` adiabatic zone '' @xmath20  g where the flow energy is reprocessed into particles with lorentz factors @xmath21 ( beloborodov 2013 ) ; their multiplicity @xmath22 is basically set by energy conservation and mainly controlled by the discharge voltage .",
    "both electrons and positrons outflow from the magnetar , and radiation pressure forces the particles to accumulate in the equatorial plane of the magnetic dipole , where they annihilate .",
    "the required current @xmath23 is sustained in the outflow by a moderate electric field @xmath16 .",
    "this field is self - consistently generated to maintain a small difference between the velocities of the @xmath24 charges , @xmath25 , so that the condition @xmath26 is satisfied with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in the simplest , two - fluid model (  3 ) the velocities @xmath12 tend to be `` locked '' by the balance of two forces , electric and radiative .",
    "the coronal outflow significantly changes the radiation it interacts with via scattering .",
    "the problem of outflow dynamics can be formulated as a problem of self - consistent radiative transfer where particles and photons exchange energy and momentum as they flow away from the neutron star .",
    "this problem is solved in this paper using a specially designed numerical method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 discusses the creation of @xmath0 pairs and their circulation in the inner and outer magnetosphere .",
    "3 presents the model of a radiatively locked outflow in its simplest version using a two - fluid description and assuming an optically thin magnetosphere .",
    "4 discusses the two - stream instability in the @xmath0 flow and the origin of low - frequency emission from magnetars .",
    "then , in  5 and 6 we formulate and solve the full problem where an outflow with a broad momentum distribution function and significant optical depth interacts with the neutron - star radiation . the numerical method and results",
    "are described in  6 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  7 .",
    "the creation of @xmath0 pairs by an accelerated particle is a two - step process : the particle generates a high - energy photon ( via resonance scattering ) and then the photon converts to an @xmath0 pair in the strong magnetic field . an accelerated electron ( or positron ) can resonantly scatter photons of energy @xmath29 once it reaches the lorentz factor required by the resonance condition @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the angle between the photon and the electron velocity and @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath31 is not small , the resonance condition gives [ eq : res1 ] ~10 ^ 3 b_14()^-1 .",
    "the scattered photons are boosted in energy by the factor of @xmath33 .",
    "such high - energy photons quickly convert to @xmath0 pairs in the strong magnetic field , creating more particles near the star .",
    "a similar process of @xmath0 creation operates in the polar - cap discharge of ordinary pulsars , but in a different mode . in ordinary pulsars , the high - energy photons convert to @xmath0 with a significant delay .",
    "the scattered photon initially moves nearly parallel to @xmath2 and converts to @xmath0 only when it propagates a sufficient distance where its angle @xmath34 with respect to @xmath2 increases so that the threshold condition for conversion is satisfied .",
    "this delay leads to the large unscreened voltage in pulsar models .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic field of magnetars is so strong that pair creation can occur immediately following resonant scattering ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 )",
    ". the energy of a resonantly scattered photon is related to its emission angle @xmath34 by e(_)= , where @xmath35 is the energy of the first excited landau level and @xmath36  g. the scattered photon may immediately be above the threshold for conversion , @xmath37 , if @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 discharge in magnetars can screen @xmath16 more efficiently than in ordinary pulsars and buffer the voltage growth once the lorentz factors of accelerated particles reach @xmath39 given in  ( [ eq : res1 ] ) .",
    "the discharge on twisted closed field lines can be explored using a direct numerical experiment where plasma is represented by a large number of individual particles in the self - consistent electric field .",
    "the existing numerical simulations ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) describe the discharge on field lines that extend to a moderate radius @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "the magnetic field is ultrastrong everywhere along such field lines , @xmath42 , and resonant scattering events may effectively be treated as events of pair creation  a significant fraction of scattered photons immediately convert to @xmath0 .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that voltage and pair creation self - organize in the twisted magnetosphere so that a particle on average scatters @xmath43 photon as it travels through the electric circuit , maintaining the near - critical multiplicity of pair creation @xmath44 .",
    "this criticality condition regulates the induced voltage to @xmath45  v , which accelerates @xmath0 particles to lorentz factors @xmath46 .",
    "the electric circuit operates as a _",
    "discharge , in the sense that the accelerating voltage is distributed along the entire field line between its footpoints on the star .",
    "it is quite different from the localized `` gap '' that is usually considered above polar caps in pulsars .",
    "the discharge fluctuates on the light - crossing timescale @xmath47 and persists in the state of self - organized criticality .",
    "the behavior of the global circuit resembles a continually repeating lightning : voltage between the footpoints of the field line quasi - periodically builds up and discharges through the enhanced production of charges .",
    "the average plasma density in the circuit @xmath17 is close to the minimum density @xmath48 , as required by the criticality condition @xmath49 .",
    "the global - discharge picture applies only to field lines with @xmath40 and becomes irrelevant when the currents are erased in the inner magnetosphere as shown in figure  1 .",
    "then the observed activity must be associated with currents on field lines with large @xmath4 , i.e. extending far from the star .",
    "the discharge on extended field lines may be expected to have a similar threshold voltage @xmath45  v , because the conversion of upscattered photons to @xmath0 is efficient near the field - line footpoints where @xmath42 . in this zone , particles are able to resonantly scatter soft x - rays once they are accelerated to @xmath46 (  [ eq : res1 ] ) , which requires @xmath45  v. further growth of voltage would cause excessive creation of @xmath0 moving in both directions , toward and away from the star , leading to efficient screening of @xmath16",
    ".    a large fraction of the created particles must outflow to @xmath50 along the extended field lines .",
    "the rate of resonant scattering by a relativistic particle _ increases _ as it moves from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the particle scatters many more photons , because the resonance condition shifts toward photons of lower energy @xmath53 whose number density is larger .",
    "note also that the effective cross section for resonant scattering @xmath54 increases as @xmath55 ( here @xmath56 is the classical electron radius ) .",
    "practically all photons scattered by the outflowing particles in the region @xmath57  g convert to @xmath0 ; detailed monte - carlo simulations of this process are presented in the accompanying paper ( beloborodov 2013 ) .",
    "in essence , the particles outflowing from the discharge zone lose energy to photon scattering , and this energy is transformed to new generations of @xmath0 . as a result , the @xmath0 multiplicity of the outflow increases from @xmath44 to @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that there is no charge starvation in the outer corona  there are plenty of charges to conduct the current demanded by the twisted magnetic field .",
    "pair creation sharply ends near the surface of @xmath59  g ; outside this surface the resonantly scattered photons are not absorbed . the steady relativistic outflow without pair creation maintains @xmath60 along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this follows from conservation of magnetic flux , charge , and particle number , which give @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 along the field line .",
    "the picture of plasma circulation in the magnetar magnetosphere is summarized in figure  2 .",
    "the inner corona ( field lines with @xmath4 of a few neutron - star radii ) is filled with the ultra - relativistic counter - streaming @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this region ,",
    "resonant scattering is marginally efficient and a global discharge operates as described in  2.1 , with multiplicity @xmath44 . outside this region ,",
    "pair multiplicity is much higher and the electric current is organized with both @xmath64 and @xmath65 outflowing from the star .",
    "the exact location of the boundary between the two regions depends on the strength of the magnetic field of the star .    in the outer corona ,",
    "the opposite flows in the nothern and southern hemispheres meet in the equatorial plane of the magnetic dipole and stop there .",
    "two effects prevent their inter - penetration .",
    "( 1 ) radiative drag is strong in the outer corona and pushes both nothern and southern flows toward the equatorial plane ( see  3 below ) .",
    "( 2 ) when the two opposite flows try to penetrate each other , a two - stream instability develops . as a result , a strong langmuir turbulence is generated , which inhibits the penetration .",
    "this effect is particularly important in the transition region between the outer and inner corona . for these field lines ,",
    "resonant scattering is efficient enough to generate @xmath66 but not strong enough to stop the pair plasma in the equatorial plane .",
    "then the colliding northern and southern flows are stopped by the two - stream instability .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the inner corona where the induced electric field enforces the counter - streaming of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. the opposite flows with @xmath44 are forced to penetrate each other despite the two - stream instability .    the density of @xmath0 pairs accumulated in the outer equatorial region ( shown in blue in fig .",
    "2 ) is regulated by the annihilation balance . in a steady state , the annihilation rate is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the electric current through the annihilation region .",
    "the corresponding annihilation luminosity is @xmath69 .",
    "dynamics of the @xmath0 flow in the outer corona ( @xmath50 ) is influenced by resonant scattering , which exerts a strong force @xmath70 on the particles along the magnetic field lines .",
    "@xmath70 vanishes only if the particle has the `` saturation momentum '' @xmath71 such that the radiation flux measured in the rest frame of the particle is perpendicular to @xmath2 . in the simplest case of a weakly twisted dipole magnetosphere exposed to central radiation @xmath71",
    "is given by ( appendix  b ) , .",
    "in this region , stellar radiation may be approximated as a central flow of photons , neglecting the angular size of the star @xmath72 . ] [ eq : sat1 ] p_(r,)= , where momentum is in units of @xmath73 .",
    "the radiative force always pushes the particle toward @xmath74 .",
    "the strength of this effect may be measured by the dimensionless `` drag coefficient , '' [ eq : drag ] .",
    "momentum @xmath71 is a strong attractor in the sense that deviations @xmath75",
    "generate @xmath76 in the outer corona ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "even an extremely strong radiative drag does not imply that @xmath65 and @xmath64 acquire exactly equal velocities @xmath77 .",
    "such a `` single - fluid '' flow would be unable to carry the required electric current @xmath78 , and @xmath16 must be induced to ensure a sufficient velocity separation @xmath79 .",
    "below we describe the two - fluid model with @xmath80 .",
    "consider an @xmath0 flow in the region where no new pairs are produced . in a steady state ,",
    "the fluxes of electrons and positrons are conserved @xmath81 .",
    "this implies @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the contributions of electrons and positrons to the net electric current @xmath84 . since @xmath0 move along the magnetic field lines , @xmath85 where @xmath86 are scalar functions . from @xmath82 and",

    "then the neutrality condition becomes @xmath99 .",
    "magnetars rotate slowly ( typical @xmath100  rad / s ) and hence a small fraction of their magnetic flux is open , typically @xmath101 . in the main , closed magnetosphere , the condition @xmath102 is satisfied , and neutrality requires @xmath27 with a high accuracy . ]",

    "an electric field @xmath16 must be established in the outflow to sustain the condition  ( [ eq : j ] ) against the radiative drag that tends to equalize @xmath107 and @xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "this moderate electric field must be self - consistently generated by a small deviation from neutrality , @xmath110 .",

    "straightforward algebra gives , @xmath122    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      suppose that @xmath0 plasma is injected near the star with a given multiplicity , e.g. @xmath123 , and a given high lorentz factor , e.g. @xmath124 .",

    "a more detailed model will be developed in  5 and 6 , which will take into account radiation scattered in the magnetosphere ; then radiation field is not central , and we will have to solve radiative transfer to determine the flow momentum .",

    "this estimate describes the optical depth seen by photons that can be resonantly scattered by the flow , i.e. the resonance condition @xmath30 is satisfied somewhere along the photon trajectory .",
    "the large @xmath132 implies the presence of scattered radiation in the magnetosphere , which is quasi - isotropic rather than central .",
    "this increases the drag exerted on the outflow and reduces @xmath71 .",
    "one may also expect a self - shielding effect : the drag force @xmath70 experienced by an electron ( or positron ) is reduced by the factor of @xmath134 .",
    "the problem of self - consistent outflow dynamics will be solved in  5 and 6 .",

    "the two fluids with densities @xmath147 move in the opposite directions with non - relativistic velocities @xmath148 , so the dispersion relation  ( [ eq : disp ] ) simplifies .",

    "then the contribution of positrons to the dispersion relation is small compared to that of the electrons .",
    "the growth rate of the instability is given by @xmath152 ( e.g. lyubarsky & petrova 2000 ) .",
    "this estimate gives the characteristic length - scale of the instability @xmath153 , which is much shorter than the electron free path to resonant scattering , @xmath154 .",

    "a simplest estimate suggests that this effect could be very strong .",
    "suppose a substantial fraction of the energy density of the flow @xmath159 is given to plasma oscillations .",

    "this value turns out to be very small , @xmath181 .",
    "thus , the measured anomalous resistivity is small , in sharp contrast with the simplest estimate  ( [ eq : diff ] ) that would predict @xmath182 and hence @xmath183 .",
    "the failure of the estimate  ( [ eq : diff ] ) is related to the assumption that the stochastic electric force applied to the particle is random , uncorrelated on timescales longer than @xmath184 .",
    "the numerical simulation indicates that this assumption is incorrect .",
    "apparently , a complicated time - dependent pattern is organized in the phase space , which allows the charges to find small - resistance paths through the waves of @xmath16 and conduct the current at a low net voltage and a low dissipation rate .",
    "one limitation of the numerical experiment should be noted : the one - dimensional computational box allows no dependence of @xmath16 on the transverse coordinates @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which excludes the coupling of langmuir waves to the transverse electro - magnetic modes . a two - dimensional ( or a complete three - dimensional ) simulation will be needed to explore the role of the transverse modes .",
    "we anticipate that a low anomalous resistivity will be found in the full simulations .",
    "a high resistivity would imply a quick dissipation of magnetospheric currents , which would produce a high luminosity and quickly erase the magnetic twist .",
    "this is not supported by observations of magnetars .",
    "the observed luminosities and evolution timescales are consistent with the model neglecting the anomalous resistivity , where voltage is controlled by the threshold of the @xmath0 discharge , @xmath187  v.    the numerical simulation shows that the two - stream instability significantly changes the momentum distributions of electrons and positrons from the injected delta - functions @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the @xmath0 distributions are broadened so that they fill the region between the injection momenta @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( figure  6 ) .",
    "an important implication of the two - stream instability is the excitation of a strong plasma turbulence that can generate coherent low - frequency radiation . the two - stream instability is often considered in pulsar models as a mechanism feeding radio emission from the open field - line bundle ( e.g. sturrock 1971 ; cheng & ruderman 1977 ) .",
    "a related model invoking radiative drag was considered by lyubarsky & petrova ( 2000 ) . so that it sustains the electric current @xmath78 ; without @xmath16 radiative drag",
    "would equalize the velocities of all particles at @xmath190 . ]",
    "in the @xmath0 flows around magnetars , the two stream instability is naturally driven by the strong electric current in the system that tends to lock itself in the two - fluid configuration as described in  3 .",
    "the instability is continually pumped by the radiative drag in the dense radiation field of the magnetar .",
    "the generated low - frequency radiation has the best chance to escape near the magnetic axis , where the plasma density is lowest and its lorentz factor is highest .",
    "note that the two - stream instability operates on the closed ( twisted ) field lines , which carry significant magnetic flux .",
    "this allows the low - frequency emission to be unusually bright , even though the voltage @xmath191  v is small by the ordinary - pulsar standards .",
    "radio pulsations have been detected and studied in detail in two magnetars xte  1810 - 197 and 1e  1547.0 - 5408 ( camilo et al .",

    ", voltage is likely near the threshold of @xmath0 discharge , which gives @xmath201  v.    therefore , we conclude that the electric current associated with observed radio emission is large , @xmath202 , and should flow in the closed ( twisted ) magnetosphere , giving a bright and relatively broad radio beam .",
    "this is consistent with the unusually broad radio pulses of magnetars , much broader than the typical pulse of ordinary pulsars with similar periods ( camilo et al . 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "note also that the plasma density in the twisted closed magnetosphere reaches much higher values than in the open field - line bundle , and the plasma frequency may approach the infrared band .",
    "this may explain the observed hard radio spectra .",
    "one could consider the possibility that the radio luminosity of magnetars is generated by enhanced dissipation in the open field - line bundle and its immediate vicinity .",
    "thompson ( 2008b ) suggested that the diffusion of magnetic twist @xmath203 in the closed magnetosphere initiates a strong alfvnic turbulence near the light cylinder , with a high dissipation rate .",
    "this picture assumes that the magnetic twist tends to spread due to ohmic diffusion , as observed in normal laboratory plasma with a finite resistivity .",
    "however , later work ( beloborodov 2009 ; 2011a ) showed that the twists in neutron - star magnetospheres evolve differently : the twist is erased `` inside out '' rather than spreads diffusively .",
    "the twist evolution @xmath204 is controlled by voltage induced along the magnetic field lines , @xmath179 , so that @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the magnetic flux function labeling the field lines ( @xmath207 on the magnetic dipole axis ) .",
    "an increased voltage near the axis would imply a large negative @xmath208 , which implies a large negative @xmath204 , i.e. rapid untwisting .",
    "thus , the high-@xmath179 twist near the open field - line bundle can not be sustained .",
    "the ohmic effects in the closed magnetosphere can pump the twist near the open bundle only if @xmath179 is _ reduced _ toward the magnetic dipole axis , i.e. @xmath209 . then the twist pumping continues until the expanding cavity @xmath210 reaches the open bundle ; a snapshot of this evolution is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the pumping of @xmath203 leads to outbursts and spindown anomalies ( parfrey et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "our scenario for the low - frequency emission from magnetars may be summarized as follows .",
    "the emission is generated by the two - stream instability on the twisted closed field lines with the apex radii @xmath4 such that @xmath211 .",
    "these field lines carry a large electric current @xmath212 and a modest voltage @xmath191  v. the high plasma density and the broad beam of radiation expected on these field lines explain the unusual radio pulsations of magnetars .",

    "relativistic zone @xmath299 ( blue to green in figure  9 ) .",
    "this zone is transparent for essentially all thermal photons flowing from the star , except for rare photons in the far wien tail of the planck spectrum , which may be neglected .",

    "it mainly interacts with ( and is decelerated by ) the quasi - thermal photons that flow from the equatorial equator .",
    "it is easy to see why the outflow in the relativistic zone @xmath313 is regulated so that it interacts with a tiny fraction of the thermal photons around the magnetar . scattering on average boosts",

    "the self - consistent temperature is sufficiently low so that fusion reactions occur only in the far tail of the maxwell distribution ; as a result only rare particles participate in burning , and these particles are concentrated in a narrow interval of ( large ) momenta , a phenomenon known as the gamow peak .",
    "similarly , our self - consistent outflow moves sufficiently slow so that resonant scattering is only enabled between rare particles with the highest @xmath298 and rare thermal photons with the highest energies in the particle rest frame .",
    "these lucky photons have the largest @xmath31 ( gained after reflection from the equatorial reflector ) and large @xmath319 . the inward direction ( @xmath320 ) of the reflected photons",
    "gives them particularly large blueshift in the outflow rest frame and hence reduces the energy requirement in the lab frame .",
    "this makes the reflected photons the dominant targets for scattering even though their density is much smaller than the density of photons flowing directly from the star .",
    "the reflected photons have a diluted quasi - thermal spectrum of temperature @xmath310 .",
    "in essence , we observe in our simulations that the outflow moves fast enough to resonantly interact with reflected photons of energy @xmath321 ( the low - density exponential tail of the thermal spectrum ) , and slow enough to not interact with the main peak of the reflected thermal spectrum @xmath322 .",
    "this condition , together with the resonance condition @xmath30 and @xmath323 , determines that the scattering plasma moves with lorentz factor [ eq : gsc ] , as long as @xmath324 . in this regime ,",
    "the number of target photons visible to an outflowing particle has a strong exponential sensitivity to the particle momentum @xmath237 .",
