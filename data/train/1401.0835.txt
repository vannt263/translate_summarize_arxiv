    "several researchers@xcite investigated compact stars analytically or numerically . stars , in general , are evolved by burning lighter elements into heavier nuclei from the time of birth . in the end of nuclear burnning white - dwarf",
    ", neutron stars , quark stars , dark stars and eventually black holes may formed due to strong gravity . to include the effects of local anisotropy ,",
    "bowers and liang ( 1974)@xcite stressed on the importance of local anisotropic equations of state for relativistic fluid sphere .",
    "they showed that anisotropy may have effects on such parameter like maximum equilibrium mass and surface redshift . in stellar system ,",
    "ruderman ( 1972)@xcite argued that , in very high density range @xmath1 nuclear matter may have anisotropic features and nuclear interaction should be treated relativistically .",
    "anisotropy in matter indicates that radial pressure @xmath2 is not same as the tangential pressure @xmath3 .",
    "a star becomes anisotropic , if its matter density exceeds the nuclear density@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may occur for existence of solid core , phase transition , presence of electromagnetic field etc .",
    "4u 1820 - 30 resides in the globular cluster ngc 6624 .",
    "it is an ultra - compact binary and has an orbital period of 11.4 minutes@xcite . during rossi x - ray timing explorer(rxte ) observations , it has been observed that 4u 1820 - 30 exhibits a super - burst .",
    "possibly this is due to burning of a large mass of carbon @xcite .",
    "the 4u 1820 - 30 exhibits super burst , however , these strange stars may be made of chemically equilibrated strange matter .",
    "scientists are searching that matter distribution which should be incorporated in energy momentum tensor to describe strange stars .",
    "this paper depicts how this is accomplished mathematically and discuss the consequences of the properties of the strange stars .",
    "there are many high masses stars are found in different types of pulsar binaries . in these cases",
    "the masses rely an observation of periastron advance which is believed to be due to general relativistic effects only rather than other effects due to rotationally and tidally induced quardrupoles .",
    "one of the useful tool for determining masses of the compact stars is x - ray eclipses .",
    "the binary eclipses are approximated analytically by assuming that the companion star is spherical with an effective roche lobe radius .    in 1939 ,",
    "tolman@xcite proposed static solutions for a sphere of fluid . in that article , he pointed out that due to complexity of the vii - th solution ( among the eight different solutions ) , it is not a feasible one for physical consideration ( there was a misprint in the tolman solution vii ( 4.7 ) but that does not affect the original solution ) .",
    "it seems due to complicated nature of the solution he did not able to provide more physical properties of the solution .",
    "rather we say that he did not try to explore physics of his solution vii due to complexity of the solution .",
    "we thought this solution may explore some physics . in this work",

    "+ motivated by the above fact , we are specifically interested for modeling strange star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "we compare our measurements of mass , radius , central density , surface density and surface red - shifts with the strange star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 and it is found to be consistent with standard data@xcite .",
    "+ the density within the strange stars are normally beyond the nuclear matter density .",
    "the theoretical advances in last few decades indicate that pressures within the stars are anisotropic .",
    "thus one would expect anisotropy plays a major role for modelling these stars .",
    "we have considered the interior space time geometry of the strange star is tolman vii type and try to investigate the matter distributions which produce this space time .",
    "our calculations show that the matter distribution that produces tolman vii type spacetime geometry should be anisotropic .",
    "this helps us for modelling strange star which is anisotropic in nature as the density within the strange stars are normally beyond the nuclear matter density .    in this work ,",
    "we have chosen the interior space time geometry of the strange star is tolman vii type and try to investigate the matter distributions which produce this space time .",
    "we have assumed only tolman vii space time for modelling strange stars .",
    "the other solutions of tolman are not interesting to us as far as we have studied @xcite . in tolman",
    "i solution , @xmath4 , i.e. redshift function is constant , therefore not interesting .",
    "tolman ii corresponds to schwarzschild de - sitter solution . in tolman iii solution , the energy density is constant , therefore not interesting . in tolman iv and v , redshift function are very much specific , therefore not interesting . in tolman",
    "vi , coefficient of @xmath5 has been taken as constant .",
    "therefore we did not consider .",
    "the tolman viii solution , @xmath6\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is conformally related to the metric whose redshift function is very specific ( polynomial function of r ) .",
    "so , we discarded it .",

    "we assume that the interior space - time of a star is described by the metric @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are constants .",
    "such type of metric ( 1 ) was proposed by tolman @xcite(known as tolman vii metric)to develop a viable model for a star .",
    "we assume that the energy - momentum tensor for the interior of the star has the standard form @xmath12",
    "in this section we will discuss the following features of the anisotropic strange star :      now from eqn.(3 ) and eqn .",
    "( 6)we get    @xmath23    where we have assumed that @xmath24 is the radius of the star and @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the matter density at center and surface of the star .",
    "now , we will check , whether at the centre of the star , matter density dominates or not . here",
    ", we see that @xmath27 clearly , at the centre of the star , density is maximum and it decreases radially outward .",
    "+ similarly , from eq.(4 ) , we get @xmath28 now , at the centre(r=0 ) , @xmath29 therefore , at the centre , we also see that the radial pressure is maximum and it decreases from the centre towards the boundary .",
    "thus , the energy density and the radial pressure are well behaved in the interior of the stellar structure .",
    "variations of the energy - density and two pressures have been shown in fig .  1 and fig .  2 , respectively .",
    "the anisotropic parameter @xmath30 representing the anisotropic stress is given by fig.3 .",
    "the ` anisotropy ' will be directed outward when @xmath31 i.e. @xmath32 and inward when @xmath33 i.e. @xmath34 it is apparent from the fig.(3 ) of our model that a repulsive ` anisotropic ' force ( @xmath35 ) allows the construction of more massive distributions .",

    "in this work we have investigated the nature of anisotropic strange stars in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 by taking following considerations : ( a ) the stars are anisotropic in nature i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "( b ) the space - time of the strange stars can be described by tolman vii metric .",
    "+ the results are quite interesting , which are as follows : ( i ) though the radial pressure@xmath2 vanishes at the boundary @xmath83 , tangential pressure@xmath3 does not . however , at the centre of the star , it s anisotropic behavior vanishes .",
    "( ii ) our model is well stable according to herrera stability condition @xcite .",
    "( iii ) from mass - radius relation , any interior features of the star can be evaluated .",
    "+ therefore , our overall observations of anisotropic strange stars under tolman vii metric satisfies all physical requirements of a stable star .",
    "+ it is to be noted that while solving einstein s equations as well as for plotting , we have set c = g=1 .",
    "now , plugging g and c into relevant equations , the values of the central density and surface density of our strange star turn out to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the numerical values of the parameters as @xmath86 .",

    "@xcite reported that the gravitational redshift of strange star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 , based on the modeling of the relativistically broadened iron line in the x - ray spectrum of the source observed with suzaku is @xmath88 .",
    "the surface redshift of our strange star with radius @xmath89 km turns out to be @xmath90 .",
    "this indicates that the measurement of redshift of our strange star is nearly reliable with the strange star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 .",
