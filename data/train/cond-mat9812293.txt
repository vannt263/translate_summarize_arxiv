    "among the iii - v semiconductors the nitride - based semiconductors have received both scientific and technological attention over the past years owing to their excellent physical properties.@xcite the fascinating mechanical properties , such as hardness , high melting temperature , high thermal conductivity , and large bulk moduli make them useful for protective coatings . in particular , the electronic properties , characterized by large band gaps and relatively low dielectric constants , indicate tremendous potential applications in optical devices working in the blue and ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "recently , high - power blue and green light emitting diodes ( leds ) have been fabricated by using ingan - based multiquantum - well structures and are commercially available .",
    "@xcite blue and uv nitride semiconductor laser diodes ( lds ) have also successfully been demonstrated .",
    "@xcite    consequently there has been great interest in the fundamental properties , the understanding of which can render the improvement of the materials and device quality possible .",
    "heterostructures based on gan and ga@xmath0al@xmath1n have become important candidates for optoelectronic materials .",
    "great attention has been paid to the nitride heterostructures and layered structures .",
    "short - period superlattices ( sl s ) have been successfully fabricated by advanced growth techniques .",
    "@xcite phonon spectra of these sl s were investigated by infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy . @xcite",
    "it has been known that gan and aln are crystallized in the stable wurtzite structure and metastably in the cubic structure .",
    "phonons in cubic gan / aln systems have drawn interest in recent years .",
    "theoretical studies on phonons in cubic gan / aln sl s have been reported by several groups .",
    "@xcite there have been , however , few studies of phonons in hexagonal gan / aln sls,@xcite where the constituents have wurtzite structures .    in this paper",
    "we develop a planar force - constant model ( pfcm ) to describe the longitudinal phonons in wurtzite gan and aln propagating along the [ 0001 ] direction .",
    "we then apply the pfcm to study the phonons in hexagonal ( 0001)-gan / aln sl s .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the pfcm is described in section ii .",
    "the calculated results for hexagonal ( 0001)-gan / aln sl s are presented in section iii and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "in general , a three - dimension calculation is necessary in the discussion of phonons because of the coupling between longitudinal and transverse vibrations . for the vibrations of wurtzite compounds along the [ 0001 ] direction , however , the longitudinal and transverse vibrations can be decoupled . as a result , the longitudinal and transverse vibrations can be treated separately .",
    "the pftm for wurtzite gan or aln is schematically displayed in fig .",
    "the dynamical matrix elements are given by @xmath2 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{dy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the wave - vector ; @xmath4 is the index of a unit cell and @xmath5 stands for the index of atoms in the unit cell ; @xmath6 is the mass of the atom @xmath5 ; @xmath7 is the planar force - constant between the atoms @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is the position of the atom @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamical matrix subjects to the following secular equation    @xmath12    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the vibrational modes can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ secular ] ) .",
    "four planar force - constants shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are used for either gan or aln .",
    "they are two cation - anion planar force - constants , one cation - cation force - constant and one anion - anion force - constant .",
    "the on - site force - constants @xmath13 can be obtained from the sum rules @xmath14    the values of the four planar force - constants are obtained by a fitting procedure .",
    "the existing experimental data that are useful in fitting are the a@xmath15(lo ) phonon frequency at the zone - center determined by raman spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , the four planar force - constants are obtained by fitting them to the three - dimensional calculations.@xcite the fitted a@xmath15(lo ) phonon frequency , two b@xmath15 phonon frequencies and the elastic constant @xmath16 are given in table [ tab1 ] together with the corresponding experimental data and other theoretical results .",
    "it is obvious that the fitted a@xmath15(lo ) phonon frequencies of both gan and aln are in good agreement with the raman experimental data .",
    "the two b@xmath15 phonon frequencies agree fairly well with other theoretical calculation .",
    "the fitted elastic constants @xmath16 are also in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "the resulting four planar force - constants are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the calculated phonon dispersion based on the obtained planar force - constants for wurtzite gan and aln for the longitudinal polarization along the [ 0001 ] direction are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the four planar - force - constants can give very satisfactory phonon dispersion of both gan and aln compared with other three - dimensional calculations.@xcite",
    "from fig . [ fig2 ] some general features of phonon modes in hexagonal gan / aln sl s can be postulated .",
    "if a sl mode is located inside gan or aln continuum while gan and aln phonon continua do not overlap , vibrations of this mode will sharply be confined to one of the constituent layers since the other constituent can not sustain this kind of vibrations . if a mode is located in a region where gan and aln phonon continua overlap the mode will be a resonant , quasi - confined one because the vibrations in another constituent layers will be excited .",
    "if there is a sl mode with its frequency lies neither in gan continuum nor aln continuum the vibrations of this mode will be constrained in the interface region .",
    "it is a microscopic interface mode .    with the pfcm introduced in the above section phonons in any hexagonal ( 0001)-(gan)@xmath17/(aln)@xmath18",
    "sl s can be studied , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number of bilayers@xcite of gan and aln , respectively . for gan",
    "/ aln sl s , the planar force - constants are assumed to have the same values as corresponding bulk except that across an interface the planar force - constants are taken to be the average of those for gan and aln .",
    "the calculated phonon dispersion and vibrational patterns is given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for a ( 0001)-(gan)@xmath21/(aln)@xmath21 sl . it is obvious that the vibrations of modes 1 - 3 are sharply confined to aln layers .",
    "they are aln - like modes originated from the a@xmath15 branch of aln .",
    "there is nearly no dispersion for these modes due to the strong confinement of vibrations .",
    "mode 4 is also an aln - like mode , but it is from the optical b@xmath15 branch of aln .",
    "the frequency of mode 5 is slightly above the a@xmath15 branch of gan .",
    "it is an aln - like mode , from the b@xmath15 branch of aln .",
    "finite excitations in gan layers exist near the interfaces .",
    "modes 6 - 9 are resonant , quasi - confined gan - like modes due to the fact that their frequencies are inside the overlap region of the b@xmath15 branch of aln and a@xmath15 branch of gan .",
    "vibrations in aln layers could be excited .",
    "consequently , there exists finite dispersion for these modes .",
    "mode 10 is a gan - like mode with vibrations confined to gan layers .",
    "modes 11 - 13 are aln - like modes and they are from the acoustic b@xmath15 branch of aln .",
    "the remaining modes are folded acoustic modes .",
    "the minigaps in the zone - center and zone - boundary are due to the difference of the elastic properties of gan and aln .",
    "no interface modes are found in hexagonal gan / aln sl s .",
    "this may stem from the fact that there are no _",
    "new bonds _ across the interface .    for a confined mode the vibrations",
    "are sharply confined to one of constituent layers . in consequence",
    ", the confined mode can be viewed as the standing wave , described by an effective bulk wave - vector @xmath22 where @xmath20 is the nominal number of bilayers , @xmath23 is the order of a confined mode , @xmath24 is the nearest - neighbor cation - cation or anion - anion distance and @xmath25 is a parameter describing the degree of penetration of the vibrations of a confined mode into the adjacent constituent . the frequency of the confined mode can be derived simply from the bulk dispersion @xmath26 instead solving the secular equation about the dynamical matrix if the parameter @xmath25 is properly chosen .",
    "the above discussions are only valid for the confined modes not for the resonant , quasi - confined modes or the extended modes .    to test the above idea we give in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the comparison of the bulk dispersion and the frequencies of the confined modes of a ( gan)@xmath27/(aln)@xmath28 sl mapped according to eq .",
    "( [ conf ] ) .",
    "a good correspondence is established between the confined modes and the bulk dispersions for both gan and aln when @xmath25 is chosen to be 1 for all branches .",
    "this means that the vibrations of gan or aln confined modes extend about one bilayer into the adjacent constituent . for those resonant , quasi - confined modes",
    "significant vibrations exist in the other constituent layers .",
    "their frequencies are somewhat dependent on the thickness of the constituents . therefore standing wave picture",
    "is no longer valid .",
    "this can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "in the present work a pfcm is developed for wurtzite gan and aln for the longitudinal phonons propagating along the [ 0001 ] direction .",
    "we apply the pfcm to the study of the phonons in hexagonal ( 0001)-gan / aln sl s .",
    "there are confined modes and resonant , quasi - confined modes depending on their frequencies .",
