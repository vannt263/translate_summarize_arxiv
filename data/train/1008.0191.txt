    "the presence of a flat entropy core in the center of non - radiative galaxy clusters simulated with eulerian grid codes , and its complete absence in the core of galaxy clusters simulated with lagrangian approaches ( such as smoothed - particle - hydrodynamics codes , sph ) , has been object of an interesting debate in the last few years and among a number of different groups ( e.g. frenk et al.1999 ; voit et al.2005 ; dolag et al.2005 ; lin et al.2006 ; wadsley et al.2008 ; tasker et al.2008 ; mitchell et al.2008 ; springel 2010 ; abel 2010 ) .",
    "the issue of the real inner entropy profile of non - radiative galaxy clusters may be loosely connected to the case of real clusters , which are interested by cooling and energy feedback by several astrophysical sources ; nonetheless , this topic represents one of the main diagnostic to compare cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters performed with different numerical approaches .    the evolution of gas in the simulated universe , when only shock heating is present as _",
    "explicit _ source of energy dissipation , represents a rather simple scenario to study the thermodynamics of cosmic baryons starting from simple initial conditions .",
    "understanding the systematics that affect the generation of entropy in the different codes , even in this rather idealized setup , would represent a useful step forward in all research topics dealing with the numerical treatment of non - reversible processes in astrophysical plasmas at all scales .",
    "in non radiative simulations of galaxy clusters , the task of understanding the correct entropy distribution in the innermost cluster regions is made complicated by a few circumstances : a ) the radius of the entropy core produced in grid codes is rather small @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the cluster virial radius ) , and even the most resolved cosmological simulations can concentrate only a moderate number of resolution elements , of the order of @xmath5 , inside this region : therefore resolution and sampling problems may always be present ; b ) the baryon accreted by a cluster are interested by several dynamical processes across their evolution ( shock heating , violent relaxation , gas mixing and sloshing of the dark matter peak ) which distribute entropy in clusters in different ways ; disentangling the various effects within the same galaxy cluster is usually not a trivial task ; c ) due to the typical radial entropy distribution in galaxy clusters , _ physical _ mixing driven by matter sub - clumps in - falling from the outside regions , and _ numerical _ mixing or spurious heating from n - body noise would have the same net effect , leading to an increase of gas entropy within the densest regions in clusters ; unluckily , the different numerical methods are prone to numerical mixing in a ways difficult to quantify .",
    "therefore very similar entropy configurations may be degenerate respect to various interplays between physical and numerical effects along the whole cluster evolution , and specific numerical tests aiming at the close comparison between re - simulations of the same objects with different numerical methods are highly desirable in this respect .    from the literature ,",
    "the first clear indication of a fundamental difference between the results of sph codes and grid ones in galaxy cluster simulations was presented in the santa barbara comparison project ( frenk et al.1999 ) . in this work",
    ", evidence was obtained that the innermost entropy radial distribution in cluster simulated in grid methods such as enzo contain a nearly isoentropic core inside @xmath6 , at variance with sph codes ; later works basically confirmed this trend also at higher resolutions ( e.g. voit et al.2005 ; wadsley et al.2008 ) .",
    "several reasons were suggested to interpret this discrepancy : over - mixing in grid codes ( e.g. wadsley et al.2008 ) , spurious n - body heating from dm particles in the cluster core ( e.g. lin et al.2006 ; springel 2010 ) , galilean invariance in the gravity solver of grid codes ( tasker et al.2008 ; robertson et al.2010 ) , lack of physical mixing in sph codes ( e.g. dolag et al.2005 ; agertz et al.2007 ; abel 2010 ) , pre - shocking in sph ( e.g. oshea et al.2005 ) etc . to date , the most detailed analysis of the generation of entropy has been presented by mitchell et al.(2009 ) , by studying idealized cluster mergers with a non - cosmological setup with the sph code gadget2 ( springel et al.2005 ) and the grid code flash ( fryxell et al.2000 ) .",
    "the authors provided striking evidences that the mechanism at work in setting the different entropy level between sph and grid codes takes place at the time of the closest encounter between the colliding structures , and it is related to the suppression of mixing in sph because of artificial viscosity , which highly suppresses hydro instabilities and mixing motions respect to grid codes .",
    "it would be now interesting to extend the results of this seminal paper to fully cosmological simulations , and to the case of clusters in which the mass is assembled with realistic and different dynamical history ( major mergers or regular smooth accretions ) .",
    "the present paper is first devoted to constrain at which extent all the numerical effects cited above may affect also the specific distribution of gas entropy in realistic and high resolution cosmological simulations .",
    "secondly , this paper is devoted to focus on the physical mechanisms for the generation and the spreading of gas entropy within clusters , in relation to gravitational mechanisms ( e.g. shock heating and mixing motions ) and to non - gravitational ones ( e.g. radiative cooling and energy feedbacks from astrophysical sources such as agns ) . to this end",
    "we produced a set of 30 re - simulations of the same galaxy cluster , with a final mass of @xmath7 and a very quiet dynamical history for most of its evolution ( complementary results for a major merger cluster are shown in the appendix ) .",
    "the first part of this work ( sec.[sec : numerics ] ) explores many of the possible numerical mechanisms which may lead to the formation of an inner entropy core in _ cosmological _ cluster simulations , by using customized re - simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement code enzo ( norman et al.2007 ) . in detail",
    ", sec.[subsec : amr ] discusses the role of the mesh refinement strategy adopted in the simulation ; sec.[subsec : dual ] estimates the role played by cold unresolved flows and n - body gravitational heating , making changes to the `` dual energy formalism '' method adopted in enzo ; sec.[subsec : smooth ] investigates the influence of the softening length in the computation of the gravitational force in the pm method ; sec.[subsec : gas_res ] compares re - simulations adopting different maximum resolution to compute hydro - dynamics of baryons .    in sec.[subsec :",
    "tracers ] the _ physical _ generation of entropy and the volume spreading of it during cluster evolution is investigated by means of lagrangian tracers , injected and evolved in non radiative runs .",
    "radiative cooling can completely alter the above picture , in systems characterized by a cooling time shorter compared to the cluster lifetime ( e.g. katz & white 1993 ; fabian 1994 ) .",
    "indeed the hot gas phase in the core region of these systems is removed by the radiative losses , and the inward motion of the cooling gas would produce the theoretical `` cooling flow '' scenario .",
    "however , drastic cooling flows are not observed in real clusters , and additional _ non - gravitational _ heating mechanisms are need to restore ( or keep ) the cooling gas on an higher adiabat ( e.g. evrard & henry 1991 ; kaiser 1991 ; lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon 2000 ) .",
    "two of the most promising scenarios in this respect are the pre - heating scenario ( e.g. white 1991 ) , in which gas is heated before it collapses within structures , or agn feedback ( e.g. churazov et al.2000 ) , in which the inner entropy is raised by the energy released , through different channels , out of the regions surrounding the growing super massive black hole .",
    "many works investigated the above mechanisms with cosmological simulations , by implementing non - gravitational heating mechanisms in sph or in grid methods ( e.g. borgani et al.2002 ; borgani et al.2005 ; heinz et al.2006 ; sijacki & springel 2006 ; younger & bryan 2007 ; burns et al.2008 ; mc carthy et al.2009 ; teyssier et al.2010 ) . however comparing the outcomes of these studies",
    "is made complex by the great number of assumption and parameters often involved in the modelization of feedback sources . also considering the underlying fundamental differences of the hydro methods discussed above ,",
    "the characterization of the inner entropy profile of radiative cluster with non - gravitational heating mechanisms at play is a still very open topic of research for simulations .",
    "for instance , qualitatively similar models applied to gadget ( borgani et al.2002 ) or enzo simulations ( younger & bryan 2007 ) has lead to different conclusion about the efficiency of pre - heating at the scale of galaxy clusters or galaxy groups .",
    "the ability of cluster merger in quenching ( or slowing down ) the cooling catastrophe in radiative simulations is also a debated issue ( burns et al.2008 ; poole et al.2008 ) .    in the second part of the paper ( sec.[sec : phys ] ) we focus on the additional _ physical _ mechanisms which are able to affect the gas entropy distribution in real galaxy cluster , by studying in detail the effects of a ) radiative cooling ( sec.[subsec : cool ] ) ; b ) non - gravitational heating by a `` uniform '' heating mechanism in the early universe ( sec.[subsubsec : ph ] ) ; c ) non - gravitational heating by a central agn with outflows , within an already formed cluster ( sec.[subsubsec : agn]-[subsubsec : ph_agn ] ) .",
    "our goal is not that of constraining the most likely extra heating mechanism at work in real galaxy cluster , but rather to show what is the net effect of _ plausible _ heating mechanism on the entropy distribution of a cluster with an ongoing cooling flow , using a budget for the energy release under control .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] finally summarizes our discussions of the results and our conclusions , while in the appendix complementary tests studying the numerical and physical generation of entropy in major merger cluster are reported for completeness .",
    "the computations presented in this work were performed using the enzo code , developed by the laboratory for computational astrophysics at the university of california in san diego ( http://lca.ucsd.edu ) .",
    "enzo is an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cosmological hybrid code highly optimized for high performance computing ( norman et al.2007 and references therein ) .",
    "it uses a particle - mesh method to follow the dynamics of the collision - less dark matter ( dm ) component ( hockney & eastwood 1981 ) , and a eulerian solver based on the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm , woodward & colella , 1984 ) .",
    "the adopted simulational setup is the same as in vazza , gheller & brunetti ( 2010 ) . in summary ,",
    "cosmological initial conditions were produced with nested grid / dm particle distributions of increasing in order to achieve high dm mass resolution in the region of cluster formation ; also an implemented mesh refinement scheme was applied to trigger mesh refinement based on gas / dm over - density and/or velocity jumps across cells . in this scheme , a normalized 1d velocity jump across 3 adiacent cells in the scan direction ( at a given refinement level ) is recursively computed as as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the minimum velocity , in absolute value , among the 3 cells .",
    "the scheme is made manifestely non galileian invariant by the presence of @xmath10 ; this problem is unavoidable in this kind of simulations , because in principle every forming shock wave moves on a different reference frame , and a run - time procedure to account for this would represent a too large computational effort . in order to have this effect under control we performed many convergence tests with idealized and cosmological simulations with enzo , finding showing that a very good numerical convergence is achieved in cluster simulations by fixing @xmath11 ( more detailed discussions can be found in vazza et al.2009 ; vazza , gheller & brunetti 2010 ) .      in order to role of various numerical effects ( such as resolution , softening in the gravitational force , etc . )",
