    "the elastoresistance of a material describes the relation between strain and changes in the electrical resistance .",
    "an important quantity in the semiconductor industry , for which strain effects must be carefully controlled @xcite , this property has been largely overlooked in the study of strongly correlated quantum materials .",
    "however , the elastoresistance tensor contains a wealth of information relating to both the symmetry of ordered states and also the nature of fluctuations .",
    "in addition , since electronically driven phase transitions often strongly affect the conductivity of a material , and since the order parameter must be coupled to the crystal lattice , such materials are likely to have anomalously large elastoresistance values relative to simple metals . in this paper",
    "we describe a new method to determine specific terms in the elastoresistivity tensor that is especially suitable for small samples , appropriate for typical cases of interest in the field of strongly correlated materials .",
    "we focus on the specific case of the underdoped iron arsenide ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 , for which an electronically driven structural phase transition leads to a divergence of specific terms in this tensor .",
    "the iron - arsenide superconductors undergo a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural transition at a temperature that either precedes or accompanies the onset of long range magnetic order .",
    "the origin of this effect has been discussed in various contexts , including orbital order @xcite , a spin - driven nematic state @xcite , a combination of both @xcite , and a pomerancuk - type instability @xcite . in a recent paper , we presented results of measurements of the induced resistivity anisotropy in the tetragonal state of the archetypal electron - doped iron - arsenide ba(fe@xmath6co@xmath7)@xmath3as@xmath3 under conditions of uniaxial strain , using a piezoelectric stack to generate the strain @xcite .",
    "we related the induced in - plane resistivity anisotropy to the nematic susceptibility , and interpreted the divergence of this quantity as providing evidence that the structural transition is driven by an electronic nematic phase transition . in the current paper we describe the elastoresistive properties in greater detail , and show how terms in the elastoresistance tensor can be determined through measurement of longitudinal and transverse elastoresistance measurements .",

    "our initial experiments were inspired by the original work by shayegan et al @xcite , and followed a similar characterization of the piezoelectric stacks used for their measurements .",
    "some care must be taken to ensure that the strain is fully transmitted to the sample , which can be readily checked by comparing strain measurements on the top surface of the sample relative to the surface of the piezoelectric stack . in our most recent experiments , described in this paper ,",
    "samples are mounted in both longitudinal _ and _ transverse geometries such that the strain @xmath8 is parallel or perpendicular to the current in the sample respectively ( illustrated in figure 1 ) .",
    "the strain @xmath8 is modulated by varying the voltage applied to the piezoelectric stack ( figure 2(a ) ) , and measured by strain gauges glued to the surface of the piezoelectric stack .",

    "elastoresistance is rarely discussed in the context of strongly correlated materials , although it conveys a wealth of important information relevant to understanding the nature of both fluctuations and also broken symmetry states . in the following paragraphs",
    "we briefly outline the tensor description of this quantity , making clear how specific terms in the elastoresistance tensor can be determined by a combination of longitudinal and transverse elastoresistance measurements made for specific crystal orientations .",
    "we start by describing the better known case of piezoresistance .",
    "the piezoresistance of a material relates changes in resistance ( @xmath18 ) and the stresses experienced by the material . from the definition of resistivity ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "changes in the resistance are given by @xmath20 the first term on the right hand side of equation 1 describes changes in the resistivity of the material as a result of the applied stress .",
    "the second two terms describe purely geometric effects associated with changes in the length @xmath21 and cross - sectional area @xmath22 . for typical metals ,",
    "these geometric terms dominate the piezoresistance .",
    "however , as we show below , for the fe - pnictides this is not the case , and we must also consider the effect of changes in the resistivity of the material as a function of applied stress .    the piezoresistivity is a fourth rank tensor , relating the applied stress and the resistivity , both second rank tensors .",
    "it is , however , more convenient to use the symmetry properties of the resistivity @xmath19 and stress @xmath23 tensors to express these as 6 component arrays , with components @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that the piezoresistivity is described by a pseudo - second rank tensor @xmath26 ; @xmath27 where 1 = @xmath28 , 2 = @xmath29 , 3 = @xmath30 , 4 = @xmath31 , 5 = @xmath32 , 6 = @xmath33 .",
    "the stress can be expressed in terms of the elastic stiffness @xmath34 and the strain @xmath35,@xcite @xmath36 and hence we can readily derive an equivalent relation to equation 4 , relating changes in the resistivity to the strains experienced by the material : @xmath37 equation 6 defines the elastoresistivity tensor , sometimes also called the piezoresistive strain matrix , @xmath38 .",
    "the measurements we describe below directly measure terms in this tensor . for a tetragonal material , appropriate for the fe - arsenides for temperatures above the structural transition",
    ", there are 6 independent terms in the elastoresistivity tensor : @xmath39      for the longitudinal arrangement shown in figure 1(a ) , if we neglect geometric factors , the change in resistance of the crystal is given by @xmath40 the strain in the @xmath41 direction , @xmath16 , is determined by the effective poisson s ratio of the piezoelectric stack , @xmath14 , whereas the strain in @xmath42 direction , perpendicular to the plane of the crystal , is given by an effective poisson s ratio @xmath43 . although @xmath43 can be determined from knowledge of the elastic stiffness coefficients and @xmath14 @xcite , we will soon see that it cancels out when we consider the difference of longitudinal and transverse values",
    ". expressing the change of resistance in terms of just the strain in the @xmath44 direction , we then have for the longitudinal geometry ( figure 1(a ) ) @xmath45 similarly , the change in resistance for the transverse geometry ( figure 1(b ) ) is given by @xmath46 to determine other relevant terms in the elastoresistance tensor , in particular @xmath4 , we need to apply strain in directions that are not just along the crystallographic [ 100]@xmath10 tetragonal axes .",
    "if we rotate the sample around the c - axis by an angle @xmath12 , the elastoresistance tensor transforms @xcite according to @xmath47 @xmath48 hence , measurements of the longitudinal and transverse elastoresistance for samples rotated by an in - plane angle @xmath12 ( illustrated in figure 1(c ) ) are given by @xmath49 similarly , the transverse elastoresistance is given by @xmath50 it is useful at this stage to define the induced in - plane resistivity anisotropy , @xmath51 , referred to a particular set of orthogonal in - plane axes x and y ; @xmath52 since changes in the resistance have opposite signs for longitudinal and transverse configurations , to leading order the anisotropy is given by @xmath53 hence , for arbitrary angle @xmath12 , the induced anisotropy is given by @xmath54 as anticipated , terms involving @xmath55 cancel .",
    "for the two high symmetry cases @xmath12 = @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( corresponding to @xmath8 aligned along the tetragonal [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] directions respectively ) , we obtain @xmath58 @xmath59 hence , measurement of the induced resistance anisotropy , and in particular of the slope @xmath60 , combined with the measured effective poisson s ratio of the piezoelectric stack , directly yields a measure of the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the elastoresistivity tensor of the crystal sample @xcite .",
    "microscopically , the resistivity of a metal is determined by a combination of fermi surface parameters and the scattering rate . for the case of a single band , free electron model , the resistivity is given by the familiar expression @xmath63 . in this case , the induced anisotropy due to the strain effects described above is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( and @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) differ only because of the anisotropic biaxial strain .",
    "hence , the measured elastoresistance and the derived slope @xmath60 reflect induced anisotropy in both the effective mass @xmath69 and the relaxation time @xmath23 @xmath70 for the case of a simple free - electron - like metal , anisotropy in @xmath69 and @xmath23 arise from strain - induced anisotropy in the bandwidth and phonon - spectrum respectively .",
    "neither of these effects is large , and neither has a strong temperature dependence . for a multiband material ,",
    "the situation is more complex , since the conductivity is determined from the sum of all of the pockets , each described by its own parameters .",
    "even so , we can loosely think of the elastoresistivity as arising from some combination of strain - induced changes in the fermi surface parameters , parameterized by an effective mass , and in the scattering , parameterized by some effective relaxation time .",
    "measurement of the dc elastoresistivity coefficients can not distinguish these effects , but equivalent measurements of the optical conductivity under applied strain are able to differentiate between anisotropy in scattering and spectral weight , as has recently been demonstrated for ba(fe@xmath6co@xmath7)@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite .    if we also include the geometric factor described by equation 1 , then the total change in the resistance as a function of strain yields the so called `` gauge factor '' , gf , of a material .",
    "( the name derives from the use of such materials as strain gauges : the gauge factor relates the change in resistance to the strain for a given configuration . ) for the longitudinal configuration , this yields @xmath71 for ordinary metals , like copper , the first term on the right hand side is negligible as described above , and the gauge factor is almost solely determined by the geometric effect , yielding temperature - independent values with a magnitude close to 2 since the poisson s ratio , @xmath72 , for most metals is about 0.5 . for the fe - pnictides , the opposite is true , and the first term on the right hand side dominates for specific crystal orientations .",
    "this effect is intimately connected with the electronically - driven structural phase transition , as described in greater detail below .    by way of comparison , for semiconductors ,",
    "the gauge factor is typically dominated by the change of resistivity ( the first term on the right side of equation 22)and consequently can be much larger than values obtained for typical simple metals . for example",
    ", the elastoresistivity coefficients for n - si and p - si , cubic semiconductors used in the most sensitive commercially available solid - state strain gauges , are respectively @xmath73 = -100.7 , @xmath74 = 58.0 , @xmath75 = -10.8 and @xmath73 = 9.5 , @xmath74 = 1.7 and @xmath75 = 109.9 at room temperature @xcite , comparable to the maximum values observed for ba(fe@xmath6co@xmath76)@xmath77as@xmath77 in this study .",
    "however , the physical mechanism that results in the large elastoresistance of semiconductors is very different , being associated with strain - induced changes in the band gap that strongly affect the majority carrier density .",
    "consequently , the elastoresistance of semiconductors follows a characteristic @xmath78 temperature - dependence @xcite .",
    "single crystals of ba(fe@xmath6co@xmath76)@xmath77as@xmath77 with @xmath44 = 0.025 were grown from a self - flux method as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the composition was determined by electron microprobe analysis with an uncertainty of 0.0015 .",

    "electrical contact was made to sputtered gold pads using dupont 4929n silver paste , and the temperature - dependence of the resistance measured by a standard four - point technique .",

    "two samples were mounted close together on the surface of the piezoelectric stack , as illustrated in figure 1(d ) , enabling simultaneous measurement of the longitudinal and transverse elastoresistance for a given crystallographic orientation .",
    "the strain @xmath8 was measured by a strain gauge glued on the other side of the piezoelectric stack .",
    "elastoresistance measurements were made at fixed temperature by sweeping the voltage applied to the piezoelectric stack , typically between -50 v and + 150 v at a sweep rate of 8 v / s while simultaneously measuring the sample resistance and strain .",

    "similar data were obtained at 2k increments between 80k and 280k .",
    "the measured elastoresistances vary linearly with the applied strain@xcite , and are largest for @xmath87 . for each angle ,",
    "the longitudinal and transverse elastoresistances are opposite in sign , but are not exactly equal in magnitude , as can be anticipated by inspection of equations 9 and 10 .",
    "this effect arises from a combination of the effective poisson s ratio of the pzt piezo stack @xmath14 and also the effective poisson s ratio of the sample @xmath43 , this latter quantity affecting strain in the @xmath42-direction .",

    ". the data are linear with strain , with intercept at zero anisotropy for zero applied strain .",
    "for all three angles the slope @xmath60 is negative , as anticipated from figure 3 , indicating an increase ( decrease ) in the longitudinal ( transverse ) elastoresistance as a function of strain @xmath8 .",
    "the largest slope is obtained for @xmath87 ( red data points in figure 4 ) .",
    "the anisotropy in @xmath60 can be more clearly represented on a polar plot , shown in figure 5 , for which we have used the tetragonal crystal symmetry to generate equivalent data points .",
    "data for @xmath79 and @xmath81 were used to extract values for ( @xmath100 ) and @xmath62 respectively , following equations 18 and 19 , and using measured values for @xmath14 shown in figure 2(b ) . following equation 17 ,",

    "even so , the data at the intermediate angle of @xmath86 nicely confirm the anticipated angle - dependence based on the tensor transformation described in the previous section .",

    "several features of the data shown in figures 3 - 6 are unusual from the perspective of a simple metal .",
    "first , the magnitude of the elastoresistance is much larger than anticipated for a simple metal . for the specific cobalt concentration that we focus on in this paper",
    ", the @xmath4 coefficient reaches a maximum value of 24 ( @xmath105 ) for @xmath89 = 98k .",
    "the gauge factor for other doping levels rises to a maximum of 300 for @xmath44 = 0.0051 @xmath106 0.007 @xcite .",
    "as described in section 2 , for simple metals , one anticipates values of the gauge factor close to 2 since geometric effects dominate the elastoresistance . with the exception of the semimetals sb and bi , and ferromagnetic materials like ni",
    ", this is indeed found to be the case @xcite .",
    "second , the temperature dependence of the elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath4 is found to diverge towards lower temperatures .",
    "following our initial analysis in ref [ 18 ] , the data can be very well fit by a curie - weiss temperature dependence ; @xmath107 the fit , shown by a solid line in figure 6 , yields fit parameters @xmath108k , @xmath109k , and @xmath110 . using the @xmath111 value estimated from this fit , it is possible to plot the inverse elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath112^{-1}$ ] as a function of temperature ( figure 7 ) , yielding a clear linear behavior up to at least 250 k.",
    "while the strain - induced anisotropy for a simple metal will not necessarily be temperature - independent , there is no physical reason to anticipate a curie - weiss temperature dependence .",
    "finally , the elastoresistivity exhibits a large anisotropy , not just in magnitude , but also in terms of the temperature dependence , neither of which effect is anticipated for a material described by a simple nearly - free - electron picture .    in the following section , we describe how all of these observations can be understood in terms of electronic nematic order .",
    "a natural order parameter for the ferroelastic structural phase transition is the spontaneous lattice strain that develops at @xmath5 .",
    "the orthorhombic lattice parameters are rotated by @xmath81 with respect to the tetragonal unit cell , so referenced to the high - temperature tetragonal lattice the order parameter would be @xmath113 ( @xmath114 @xcite , where @xmath115 refer to the in - plane crystal axes ) .",
    "softening of the associated elastic stiffness modulus @xmath116 in the tetragonal state has been observed via resonant ultrasound measurements @xcite . for a true - proper ferroelastic phase transition ,",
    "the lattice strain is the primary order parameter , and the phase transition is driven by the elastic part of the free energy @xcite .",
    "hence , a landau treatment of a true proper ferroelastic transition begins with a free energy expansion given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 represents an externally applied stress , the elastic modulus @xmath119 is assumed to have a temperature dependence @xmath120 , and we have dropped the tensor description for simplicity . under conditions of zero stress ,",
    "the material develops a spontaneous strain at @xmath121 .",
    "within such a picture , all other physical quantities , including the resistivity , develop an in - plane anisotropy at @xmath122 as a consequence of the orthorhombicity .",
    "since all of these physical quantities share the same symmetry as the spontaneous strain , for small strains they are linearly proportional .",
    "application of external stress in the same direction as the spontaneous strain ( i.e. @xmath123 ) yields a finite strain for all temperatures , and the phase transition is smeared out .",
    "the associated strain - induced anisotropy in the resistivity in the tetragonal state is small , and hence linearly proportional to the strain , @xmath35 . with reference to equation 19 ,",
    "the proportionality constant is given by the elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath124 , the quantity that we have measured .",
    "within the picture of a true - proper ferroelastic transition , @xmath4 is not necessarily temperature independent .",
    "for example , critical fluctuations very close to the structural transition could lead to anisotropic scattering , though this effect is anticipated to be small given that the orthorhombic distortion is a q=0 phenomenon ( i.e. does not lead to large momentum transfer ) .",
    "however , the observation of a divergent elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath4 that follows curie - weiss - like temperature dependence over a wide temperature range is completely inconsistent with a scenario in which the structural transition is driven by a true - proper ferroelastic transition .",
    "rather , these data suggest either an improper or pseudo - proper ferroelastic transition , implying that the primary order parameter is not the elastic strain .    for an improper ferroelastic transition , the primary order parameter has a different symmetry to the spontaneous strain .",
    "there is no reason based on any physical measurements to expect that this is the case for ba(fe@xmath6co@xmath76)@xmath77as@xmath77 .",
    "rather , it is much more natural to assume that the primary order parameter shares the same symmetry as the spontaneous strain , which is indeed consistent with results of transport @xcite , and arpes @xcite measurements of detwinned crystals , and neutron scattering measurements @xcite of twinned crystals . lacking knowledge of the specific physical mechanism that is responsible for the electronic order that drives the lattice distortion , we need to choose suitably precise terminology that at least describes the broken symmetry , and",
    "therefore label this as an `` electronic nematic '' phase , following ref [ 44 ] .",
    "the only semantic caveats are ; first , that in contrast to liquid crystal nematic phases , this electronic nematic phase breaks a discrete ( rather than continuous ) symmetry ; and second , that use of the word nematic does not necessarily imply the orientational order of local objects .    proceeding as described above , we define an electronic nematic order parameter , @xmath125 .",
    "we do not directly measure this quantity , but assume that the resistivity anisotropy @xmath51 ( equation 15 ) is a sensitive measure of it , and is linearly proportional for small enough values ( appropriate in the tetragonal state for strained samples ) .",
    "as described in our previous paper @xcite , the associated free energy expansion is given by : @xmath126 since @xmath35 and @xmath125 have the same symmetry , they are coupled in a bilinear fashion .",
    "furthermore , since strain acts as a field on the nematic order parameter via the coupling @xmath127 , the measured proportionality constant relating the resistivity anisotropy @xmath51 and the strain @xmath113 ( i.e. the quantity @xmath62 @xcite ) is proportional to the `` nematic susceptibility '' : @xmath128 the temperature - dependence of the elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath4 can then be readily understood in terms of the pseudo - proper ferroelastic phase transition .",
    "in particular , minimization of the free energy ( equation 25 ) with respect to both @xmath35 and @xmath125 for a strained sample yields @xmath129 hence , the observation of an elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath4 that follows the mean - field curie - weiss form directly implies that the coefficient of the electronic nematic order parameter vanishes following @xmath130 , as anticipated if @xmath125 is the primary order parameter . the value @xmath109k , which is directly found from fitting the temperature dependence of the @xmath4 coefficient ( figure 6 ) , would be the mean - field critical temperature for the nematic phase transition if there were no coupling to the crystal lattice .",
    "however , as we previously described in ref [ 18 ] , the coupling @xmath127 both ensures that there is a concurrent structural phase transition and also raises the critical temperature to a value @xmath131 this is also consistent with the observation that @xmath132 ( @xmath133 for the specific cobalt concentration used in this study ) .    as a final comment",
    "we note that there is no evidence for any additional phase transition for temperature above @xmath5 , up to our maximum measured temperature of @xmath106 300k in contrast to recent claims @xcite .",
    "however , the large magnitude of the elastoresistivity coefficients imply an extreme sensitivity to in - plane stress , and consequently care must be taken when interpreting results of experiments probing in - plane anisotropy for temperature above @xmath5 since residual strain can easily cause unintentional two - fold anisotropy .",
    "in writing this paper we have had two broad goals in mind .",
    "our first goal has been to describe the elastoresistivity tensor , which relates changes in the resistance of a material to strain , and explain in some detail a new technique that we have developed to measure specific terms in this tensor .",

    "building on our earlier experiments @xcite , we have shown via a combination of longitudinal and transverse measurements that the @xmath4 elastoresistivity coefficient of this material follows a curie - weiss temperature dependence .",
