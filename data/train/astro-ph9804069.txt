    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is one of the most important universal relations in early type galaxies because it contains valuable information about the formative and evolutionary process of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the commonly used form of the scaling relation in the fp is described as @xmath0= @xmath1 , where @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are effective radius , central velocity dispersion , and mean surface brightness of elliptical galaxies , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath4 , @xmath5 are considered to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the fp derived by @xmath8 band photometry , respectively , and these values deviate significantly from the values @xmath9 and @xmath10 expected from virial theorem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this apparent deviation requires that the ratio of dynamical mass ( @xmath11 ) to luminosity of elliptical galaxies ( @xmath12 ) depends on @xmath11 as @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 ( @xmath16 = 0.12 @xmath17 0.03 for @xmath8 band ) . to understand the physical meaning of this dependence is one of the fundamental issues in the theory of galaxy formation ( e.g , bender , burstein , & faber 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "possible interpretations for the required dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath11 ( the `` slope '' or `` tilt '' of the fp ) are generally considered to be divided into the following two .",
    "one is that the required dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath11 results from the fact that the mean stellar age and metalicity of elliptical galaxies depend systematically on @xmath11 .",
    "the other is that the required dependence reflects the @xmath11 dependence of structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies ( `` nonhomology '' ) .",
    "although we should not neglect the importance of stellar populations in generating the @xmath11 dependence of the @xmath13 ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ; pahre & djorgovski 1997 ) , we here consider that the origin of the required @xmath11 dependence of @xmath13 is closely associated with the structural and kinematical properties dependent on @xmath11 or @xmath12 in elliptical galaxies .    a growing number of observational studies have been accumulated which reveal the nonhomology in structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies , such as the systematical departure from the universal light profile of elliptical galaxies , the so - called @xmath18 law ( e.g. , burkert 1993 ; caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1993 ) , the difference in the relative importance of global rotation in kinematics between elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , davies et al .",
    "1983 ) , and the ratio of dynamical mass to luminous mass ( e.g. , rix 1997 ) .",
    "these nonhomology observed in elliptical galaxies are considered to be one of the most promising candidates which can provide a plausible explanation for the origin of the slope of the fp ( ciotti , lanzoni , & renzini 1996 ; pahre et al .",
    "1995 ; prugniel & simien 1996 ; graham & mathew 1997 ) .",
    "there are a number of theoretical attempts to provide a physical basis for the origin of the above structural and kinematical nonhomology of elliptical galaxies .",
    "hjorth & madsen ( 1995 ) constructed a self - consistent equilibrium model of elliptical galaxies based upon the statistical mechanics of violent relaxation and demonstrated that if the more luminous elliptical galaxies have the so - called @xmath19 light profile with larger @xmath20 , the slope of the fp can be successfully reproduced .",
    "capelato , de carvalho , & carlberg ( 1995 ) performed a set of numerical simulations on dissipationless galaxy mergers with variously different initial conditions of mergers and found that initial orbital energy of merging systems is a primarily important factor for the radial profile of velocity dispersion and mass distribution of merger remnants and thus for the successful reproduction of the fp slope .",
    "these studies have indeed provided clues about the understanding of the origin of the fp slope , it has not been clarified , however , why and how the exponent @xmath20 in the @xmath19 light profile and the initial orbital energy of merging systems depend primarily on the galactic luminosity or mass .",
    "thus it is vital to make it clear why and how the structural and kinematical nonhomology required for the reproduction of the fp slope depends on the galactic luminosity or mass .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to elucidate the origin of the luminosity - dependent structural and kinematical properties ( `` nonhomology '' ) in elliptical galaxies and thereby to explore the physical meaning of the fp .",
    "we here focus particularly on the star formation history of elliptical galaxies and accordingly investigate the important roles of the star formation history in generating the structural and kinematical nonhomology of elliptical galaxies . in the present study , the origin of the luminosity - dependent structural and kinematical properties ( nonhomology ) is considered as follows . first , the difference in structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies is determined primarily by the difference in the star formation history of elliptical galaxies .",
    "next , the star formation history of forming elliptical galaxies depends principally on galactic luminosity .",
    "the structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies therefore depend on galactic luminosity .",
    "this consideration for the understanding of the origin of the fp slope is reasonable and realistic , since difference in star formation history between elliptical galaxies and its possible dependence on galactic luminosity are suggested both by theoretical studies and by observational ones on chemical and photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies such as color - magnitude relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the abundance ratio [ mg / fe ] ( @xcite ) , and @xmath21 line index ( faber et al .",
    "1995 ; worthey , trager , & faber 1996 ) .",
    "in investigating the non - homologous nature in elliptical galaxies , we adopt the `` merger hypothesis '' in which elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy mergers between two late - type spirals ( toomre & toomre 1977 ) .",
    "in particular , we consider galaxy mergers between two disk galaxies with a gas mass fraction larger than 0.2 observed in the present typical late - type spirals in order to mimic elliptical galaxy formation by galaxy mergers at higher redshift , which is suggested by recent observational studies on the tightness of the color - magnitude relation and the fp and on the photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies ( bower et al .",
    "1992 ; ellis et al .",
    "1996 ; franx & van dokkum 1996 ) .",
    "we do not here intend to discuss formation of elliptical galaxies within a framework of a specific cosmology such as the cdm model ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1992 ; baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we summarize numerical models used in the present study and main points of analysis of the study . in  3 , we describe the dependence of structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants on the star formation history of galaxy mergers . in this  3",
    ", we furthermore discuss how the star formation history of galaxy mergers should depend on galactic luminosity for the successful reproduction of the fp slope observed in elliptical galaxies . in  4 , we discuss a close relation between the origin of the slope and the tightness of the fp and the star formation history of galaxy mergers .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are given in  5 .",
    "we construct models of galaxy mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies with equal mass by using fall - efstathiou model ( 1980 ) .",
    "the total mass and the size of a progenitor disk are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . from now on , all the mass and length are measured in units of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , unless specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath24 = @xmath25 and @xmath26 = @xmath27 , respectively , where @xmath28 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study . if we adopt @xmath22 = 6.0 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath23 = 17.5 kpc as a fiducial value , then @xmath24 = 1.21 @xmath29 @xmath32 km / s and @xmath26 = 1.41 @xmath29 @xmath33 yr , respectively . in the present model ,",
    "the rotation curve becomes nearly flat at 0.35 radius with the maximum rotational velocity @xmath34 .",
    "in the present study , this @xmath34 is assumed to be free parameter which controls the degree of self - gravitation of initial galactic disks .",
    "the value of @xmath34 for each model is described later . if we assume , for example , that @xmath34 is equal to 1.8 which is used for most of models in the present study , the corresponding total mass @xmath35 and halo mass @xmath36 are 3.8 and 2.8 in our units , respectively .",
    "the radial ( @xmath37 ) and vertical ( @xmath38 ) density profile of a disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath39 with scale length @xmath40 = 0.2 and to @xmath41 with scale length @xmath42 = 0.04 in our units , respectively .",
    "the mass density of halo component is truncated at 1.2 in our units and its velocity dispersion at a given point is set to be isotropic and given according to the virial theorem .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity made by the gravitational field of disk and halo component , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion are given to disk component according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter ( @xcite ) @xmath43 = 1.0 .",
    "this adopted value for @xmath43 parameter is appreciably smaller compared with the value required for stabilizing the initial disk against the non - axisymmetric dynamical instability ( e.g. bar instability ) .",
    "the reason for this adoption is that the initial disk is assumed to be composed mostly of interstellar gas and thus random kinetic energy in the disk is considered to be rather smaller because of gaseous dissipation in the disk . the vertical velocity dispersion at given radius",
    "are set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point , as is consistent with the observed trend of the milky way ( e.g. , wielen 1977 ) .",
    "actually , the initial structure and kinematics in precursor disks of a merger are different between galaxy mergers and depends on the epoch of the merging .",
    "although this difference probably can yield a great variety of dynamical structures in merger remnants , we do not intend to consider this important difference for simplicity in the present paper and will address in our future paper .",
    "the collisional and dissipative nature of interstellar medium is modeled by the sticky particle method ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be emphasized here that this discrete cloud model can at best represent the @xmath44 interstellar medium of galaxies in a schematic way . as is modeled by mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) ,",
    "the interstellar medium can be considered to be composed mainly of ` hot ' , ` warm ' , and ` cool ' gas , each of which mutually interacts hydrodynamically in a rather complicated way .",
    "actually , these considerably complicated nature of interstellar medium in disk galaxies would not be so simply modeled by the ` sticky particle ' method in which gaseous dissipation is modeled by ad hoc cloud - cloud collision : any existing numerical method probably could not model the @xmath44 interstellar medium in an admittedly proper way . in the present study , as a compromise , we only try to address some important aspects of hydrodynamical interaction between interstellar medium in disk galaxies and in dissipative mergers .",
    "more elaborated numerical modeling for real interstellar medium would be necessary for our further understanding of dynamical evolution in dissipative galaxy mergers . to mimic the galaxy mergers which are occurred at higher redshift and thus very dissipative because of a considerably larger amount of interstellar gas in the progenitor disks , we assume that the fraction of gas mass in a disk , which is represented by @xmath45 , is a free parameter with the value ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 for each model is described later .",
    "the size of the clouds in the sticky particle method is set to be 3.5 @xmath29 @xmath46 in our units in the present simulations .",
    "the radial and tangential restitution coefficient for cloud - cloud collisions are set to be 0.5 and 0.0 , respectively .    in all of the simulations , the orbit of the two disks in a merger",
    "is set to be initially in the @xmath47 plane and the distance between the center of mass of the two disks , represented by @xmath48 , is assumed to be the free parameter which controls the epoch of galaxy merging .",
    "the pericenter distance , represented by @xmath49 , is also assumed to be the free parameter which controls the initial total orbital angular momentum of galaxy mergers .",
    "the orbit eccentricity , represented by @xmath50 , is also assumed to be the free parameter which controls initial orbital energy of galaxy mergers .",
    "the spin of each galaxy in a merger is specified by two angle @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where suffix @xmath53 is used to identify each galaxy .",
    "@xmath51 is the angle between the @xmath54 axis and the vector of the angular momentum of a disk .",
    "@xmath52 is the azimuthal angle measured from @xmath55 axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of a disk on to @xmath47 plane .",
    "the time when the progenitor disks merge completely and reach the dynamical equilibrium is less than 28.0 in our units for most of models and does not depend so strongly on the history of star formation in the present calculations .",
    "the value of each parameter , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath49 @xmath48 , and @xmath50 for each model is described later .",
    "as is described above , the present merger model is different from that of previous studies in the following two points .",
    "firstly , the initial gas mass fraction is assumed to be 1.0 for most of models in the present study , which is considerably different from 0.1 ( 0.2 ) adopted in previous studies .",
    "this is principally because we intend to investigate dynamical evolution of relatively higher redshift galaxy mergers , which probably have a larger amount of interstellar gas .",
    "secondly , the radius at which the rotation curve of an initial disk becomes flat is assumed to be relatively larger , which is one of characteristics of late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "considering our not including the bulge component in merger progenitor galaxies , the present model describes galaxy mergers between ` purely ' late - type disks considerably abundant in interstellar gas .",
    "star formation is modeled by converting the collisional gas particles into collisionless new stellar particles according to the algorithm of star formation described below .",
    "we adopt the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with exponent @xmath56 ( 1.0 @xmath57 @xmath56 @xmath57 2.0 , @xcite ) as the controlling parameter of the rate of star formation .",
    "the @xmath56 is set to be 2.0 for all the simulations in the present study . the amount of gas consumed by star formation for each gas particle in each time step , @xmath58 , is given as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the gas density around each gas particle and the mean gas density at 0.48 radius of an initial disk , respectively . in order to avoid a large number of new stellar particles with different mass , we convert one gas particle into one stellar one according to the following procedure .",
    "first we give each gas particle the probability , @xmath62 , that the gas particle is converted into stellar one , by setting the @xmath62 to be proportional to the @xmath58 in equation ( 1 ) estimated for the gas particle .",
    "then we draw the random number to determine whether or not the gas particle is totally converted into one new star .",
    "this method of star formation enables us to control the rapidity of star formation without increase of particle number in each simulation thus to maintain the numerical accuracy in each simulation .",
    "the @xmath63 in the equation ( 1 ) is the parameter that controls the rapidity of gas consumption by star formation : the larger the @xmath63 is , the more rapidly the gas particles are converted to new stellar particles . as a result of this , total amount of gaseous dissipation is also controlled by this parameter @xmath63 : the more amount of kinetic energy of gas particles is dissipated away by cloud - cloud collision for the models with smaller @xmath63 .",
    "this parameter @xmath63 is meant to be proportional to the ratio of dynamical time - scale of the system to the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation .",
    "furthermore the equation ( 1 ) states that a larger number of stellar particles are created at the regions where the local gas density become larger owing to the onset of local jeans instability .",
    "the positions and velocity of the new stellar particles are set to be the same as those of original gas particles . as is described above , in the present study",
    ", we do not explicitly include the ` threshold density ' of star formation , which is demonstrated to be associated with the growth of local gravitational instability with relatively smaller wavelength , that is , the toomre s @xmath43 parameter ( kennicutt 1989 ) , for isolated disk galaxies .",
    "this is because the threshold criterion , which is derived only for calmly evolving galactic disks , would not so simply be applied to the present merger model , in which the time - scale that the disk can evolve without strong dynamical perturbation is relatively smaller ( less than 10 dynamical time for typical models ) . in the present study",
    ", we do not intend to include any ` feedback effects ' of star formation such as thermal and dynamical heating of interstellar medium driven by supernovae , firstly because such inclusion probably prevents us from deducing more clearly the important roles of the rapidity of star formation and secondly because there still remains a great uncertainty concerning the numerical implementation of the ` feedback effects ' ( katz 1992 ; navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "we perform 14 sets of numerical simulations of galaxy mergers with variously different initial conditions of galaxy merging . for most of models in the present study , the initial gas mass fraction ( @xmath45 )",
    "is set to be 1.0 , principally because we intend to elucidate more clearly the roles of star formation in determining structure and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "each set of merger models is labeled according to initial orbit configuration , gas mass fraction , and the maximum value of rotation curve in galaxy mergers ( model 1 @xmath64 14 ) .",
    "the value of each parameter in each set of merger models is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the first , second , third , and fourth column denote the model number ( model 1 @xmath64 14 ) , maximum rotational velocity of a disk ( @xmath34 ) , the corresponding total mass in a merger progenitor ( @xmath35 ) and initial gas mass fraction ( @xmath45 ) , respectively .",
    "the fifth , sixth , and seventh column give the value of initial separation of galaxy mergers ( @xmath48 ) , pericenter distance ( @xmath49 ) , and orbit eccentricity ( @xmath50 ) , respectively .",
    "the values of initial intrinsic spins of two disks , @xmath51 ( @xmath53 = 1 , 2 ) , are given in the eighth and ninth columns , and those of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 = 1 , 2 ) in the tenth and eleventh columns .",
    "each set of models , model 1 @xmath64 14 , includes five @xmath65 merger models with different rapidity of star formation ( @xmath63 = 0.35 , 0.7 , 1.75 , 3.5 , and 7.0 ) .",
    "model 1 is considered to be the standard set of models and the results of the set of models are presented the most frequently in the present study .",
    "thus we examine totally 70 merger models with variously different initial conditions of galaxy merging in the present study .",
    "although the adopted value of each parameter still would not be so extended enough to describe reasonably well the @xmath44 parameter space of galaxy merging as is predicted by a specific cosmological model , we however believe that the present parameter study can enable us to provide clues about the origin of the fp .    all the calculations related to dynamical evolution of galaxy mergers including the dissipative dynamics , star formation , and gravitational interaction between collisionless and collisional component",
    "have been carried out on the grape board ( @xcite ) at astronomical institute of tohoku university .",
    "the number of halo particles and that of the gaseous ones for an isolated disk galaxy with @xmath45 = 1.0 are 5000 and 10000 , respectively . for an isolated disk galaxy with @xmath45",
    "= 0.1 and 0.5 ( for models in model 12 and 13 ) , the number of particles of halo , stars , and gas are 5000 , 5000 , and 10000 , respectively .",
    "the parameter of gravitational softening length is set to be fixed at 0.04 for models with @xmath45 = 1.0 and 0.036 for models with @xmath45 = 0.1 and 0.5 .",
    "the reason for the smaller value of the gravitational softening length in the models with @xmath45 = 0.1 and 0.5 is that initial mean separation of particles in the initial disks of these models are smaller owing to the larger number of particles .",
    "the time integration of the equation of motion is performed by using 2-order leap - flog method with time step interval equal to 0.01 in our units .",
    "energy and angular momentum are conserved within 1 percent accuracy in a test collisionless merger simulation .",
    "all of the calculations are set to be stopped at 28 @xmath26 .",
    "considering the time - scale of the present calculations and the total particle number used in this study , it is considerably reasonable that the two body relaxation due to the finite particle number of numerical simulations has a negligible effect on dynamical evolution of galaxy mergers in the present study .      in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the most extensively fundamental importance of the rapidity of star formation ( @xmath63 ) in determining structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants . the reason for our investigation of the importance of the @xmath63 and the parameterization of structural and kinematical nonhomology of merger remnants",
    "are presented as follows .      in the present study , the origin of the luminosity - dependent structure and kinematics of elliptical galaxies",
    "are considered to be closely associated with the difference in star formation history between elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging with star formation .",
    "the reason for the luminosity - dependent structure and kinematics of elliptical galaxies can be explained in the present study as follows .",
    "first , the star formation history of galaxy mergers determines structure and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "next , the star formation history of galaxy mergers depends basically on galactic luminosity .",
    "structure and kinematics of elliptical galaxies therefore depend on galactic luminosity . the adopted ` working hypothesis ' on the luminosity - dependent star formation history of elliptical galaxies ( or galaxy mergers ) is considerably realistic and reasonable , since a growing number of observational studies support this hypothesis .",
    "for example , the line ratio of [ mg / fe ] , which can be interpreted as the strength of the past activity of type - ii supernovae relative to that of the type i supernovae , implies that more luminous elliptical galaxies are likely to truncate their star formation earlier ( e.g. , worthey et al .",
    "1992 ) . furthermore , as is suggested by the analysis of @xmath66 line index , the epoch , the strength , and the duration of the latest star formation of elliptical galaxies seem quite diverse , implying that the classical single burst picture of elliptical galaxy formation becomes less attractive ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    ". it should be also emphasized that the @xmath67 color in more luminous disk galaxies , which are considered to be merger precursors of more luminous ellipticals in the present study , is found to be redder than the less luminous ones ( gavazzi & scodeggio 1996 ) .",
    "these lines of observational evidences strongly motivate us to clarify the important roles of star formation history in determining the structural and kinematical properties in elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus particularly on the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 ( @xmath63 ) : it should be emphasized here that not the simple time - scale of gas consumption by star formation but the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath76-@xmath77 ( @xmath63 ) is considered to be an important determinant for structure and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "the details concerning the physical meanings of the @xmath63 and the possible luminosity dependence of the @xmath63 are given in the appendix a. we examine the most extensively the @xmath63 dependence of the following three properties of merger remnants : projected density profile , the relative importance of the global rotation in kinematics , and the ratio of total dynamical mass to luminosity mass ( mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "all of these three properties are generally considered to be fundamental factors for generating structural and kinematical nonhomology of elliptical galaxies . for convenient , these three properties of merger remnants",
    "are hereafter referred to as `` nonhomology parameters '' .",
    "since the parameter @xmath63 is assumed to depend primarily on galactic luminosity in the present study , examining the @xmath63 dependence of the above three nonhomology parameters corresponds to clarifying the luminosity - dependent structure and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "thus , clarifying the @xmath63 dependence of the three nonhomology parameters enables us to explore the origin of the fp , in particular , a close physical relation between the star formation history of merger progenitor and the origin of the fp slope .      in order to investigate the dependence of the three nonhomology parameters on the @xmath63 in galaxy mergers",
    ", we must quantify more explicitly the nonhomology parameters .",
    "first of all , we observe how the three parameters should depend on galactic luminosity in order to satisfy the fp slope .",
    "the scaling relation expected from virial theorem is given as follows ( @xcite ) : @xmath78 where @xmath35 , @xmath12 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are total mass , luminosity , mean surface luminosity , and central velocity dispersion of elliptical galaxies .",
    "these three terms , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are referred to as nonhomology parameters in the present study .",
    "the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the above equation represent characteristics of mass distribution and those of kinematical structure , respectively . to be specific ,",
    "@xmath84 reflects systematical departures from universal density profile @xmath18 law and @xmath85 reflects the relative importance of global rotation in the kinematics of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the @xmath83 term basically represents both the nature of stellar populations and the ratio of dynamical mass to luminous mass in galaxies .",
    "since we here neglect the effects of stellar populations on the @xmath83 , the @xmath83 is considered to depend predominantly on the ratio of dynamical mass to luminous mass . by comparing the above equation ( 2 ) with the scaling relation implied by fp",
    ", we can constrain the dependence of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 on @xmath12 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . assuming that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 depend only on @xmath12",
    ", we can derive the following constraint on these three terms .",
    "@xmath86    where @xmath0 is effective radius and @xmath87 represents `` total '' nonhomology of galaxies , which includes the above three different types of nonhomology . if elliptical galaxies do not have non - homologous nature , the @xmath87 , which corresponds to the conventionally used @xmath13 , is constant for all elliptical galaxies .",
    "we use the @xmath87 in discussing the origin of the fp slope , as is described later .",
    "@xmath16 is required to be about 0.14 for @xmath8 band fp relation ( pahre et al .",
    "1995 ; djorgovski , pahre , & de carvalho 1996 ) .",
    "thus the three nonhomology parameters must cooperate to satisfy the equation ( 3 ) for the generation of the fp .",
    "next we quantify these three terms ( nonhomology parameters ) more explicitly as follows : @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 in the above equation ( 4 ) , the @xmath91 represents the gravitational radius of a galaxy and is defined as @xmath92 , where @xmath28 , @xmath93 , and @xmath35 are gravitational constant , total potential energy , and total mass in a galaxy , respectively .",
    "here we adopt the relation , @xmath94 , rather than the relation , @xmath95 , derived by prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) in estimating the @xmath81 . the first reason for this",
    "is that the present merger model is initially @xmath96 components system ( dark matter and luminous component ) to which the semi - analytic expression , @xmath95 , for @xmath97 component system can not be so simply applied .",
    "the second reason is that the @xmath98 is more feasible to estimate with smaller numerical uncertainty in the present study .",
    "the details of the dependence of the @xmath98 on the exponent @xmath20 in the @xmath19 light profile are given in ciotti ( 1994 ) .",
    "in the equation ( 5 ) , @xmath99 represents the maximum rotational velocity in a galaxy , and the value of the parameter @xmath100 depends on the details of radial distribution of kinematical properties of galaxies . in the present study , we adopt 0.81 for the @xmath100 , which is the same as that of prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) .",
    "the equation ( 5 ) means that @xmath85 is larger for elliptical galaxies which are dynamically supported more strongly by global rotation . in the equation ( 6 )",
    ", @xmath101 represents the total luminous ( baryonic ) mass .",
    "we here neglect the effects of stellar populations on the luminosity dependence of @xmath102 principally because we discuss mainly the fp in the context of structural and kinematical nonhomology of elliptical galaxies .",
    "presumably , the above semi - analytic expressions for the three nonhomology parameters are not so sophisticated enough to describe structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies @xmath103 @xmath104-@xmath105 .",
    "we believe , however , that as long as we discuss global characteristics of structure and kinematics in elliptical galaxies qualitatively , the expressions are appropriate enough to describe structural and kinematical nonhomology of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the values of the three nonhomology parameters for merger remnants are estimated as follows .",
    "since all merger models reaches dynamical equilibrium within @xmath106 = 28.0 in our units in the present study , we estimate the @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath107 for each of three projections ( @xmath47 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 plane ) in each merger remnant at @xmath106 = 28.0 .",
    "effective radius ( @xmath0 ) is set to be exactly the same as half mass radius of stellar component in the present study . projected values of @xmath99 and @xmath80 are measured inside a slit with the length of 0.2 @xmath0 for each of three projections in each model .",
    "typical length of the slit ranges from 0.04 to 0.08 in our units for the preset study .",

    "we use the derived vales of the @xmath87 in discussing the origin of the fp slope of elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging .",
    "the organization of the present investigation is two - fold .",

    ", we furthermore observe whether the variety of initial conditions of galaxy mergers such as the orbital energy , angular momentum , and gas mass fraction in merger progenitor strengthens or lessens the derived @xmath63 dependence of structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants .",
    "second , based upon the derived @xmath63 dependence of the above nonhomology parameters , we discuss in  3.2 how the rapidity of star formation ( @xmath63 ) @xmath112 depend on the galactic luminosity ( @xmath12 ) for the successful reproduction of the fp slope . in this",
    " 3.2 , we also discuss the origin of the tightness in the fp within a frame of merger scenario for elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "we first observe how the rapidity of star formation generates structural and kinematical nonhomology in merger remnants .",
    "we begin to present the results of five models with different @xmath63 (= 7.0 , 3.5 , 1,75 , 0.7 , and 0.35 ) in model 1 , since in these models we can observe typical roles of the @xmath63 in controlling structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants .",
    "figure 1 describes the time evolution of gas mass fraction of galaxy mergers for five models with different @xmath63 in model 1 .",
    "as is shown in this figure , the interstellar gas is more rapidly consumed by star formation for models with larger @xmath63 .",
    "this typical behavior of the @xmath63 in the star formation history of galaxy mergers is found to hold for all sets of models ( model 1 @xmath64 14 ) in the present study .",
    "figure 2 describes the @xmath63 dependence of the nonhomology parameters , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath113 in the merger remnants at @xmath106 = 28.0 in our units for models in model 1 . in order to show more clearly characteristics of the @xmath63 dependence of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath113 ,",
    "we preset the best fitted line derived by least square fitting of each set of experimental data to assumed relations like as @xmath81 ( @xmath82 and @xmath113 ) @xmath14 @xmath114 , where the exponent @xmath55 is described below . we can observe clear trends in the @xmath63 dependence of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath113 as follows .",
    "first , as is shown in the top panel of figure 2 , @xmath81 is appreciably larger for models with larger @xmath63 .",
    "this result demonstrates that the rapidity of star formation of galaxy mergers greatly affects the mass distribution of merger remnants , in particular , the projected density profile of stellar component .",
    "the reason for this dependence is that the rapidity of star formation of mergers basically determines how much amount of stellar component is transferred to the central region of the remnants during mergers , which is a key factor for final mass distribution of stellar component in merger remnants .",
    "the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath63 is described as @xmath81 @xmath14 @xmath115 .",
    "second , we can observe in the middle panel of figure 2 that the larger the @xmath63 is , the smaller the @xmath82 is .",
    "this result indicates that galaxy mergers with rapid gas consumption become elliptical galaxies which are dynamically supported by global rotation less strongly .",
    "this is because total amount of gaseous dissipation during merging , which is smaller for models with larger @xmath63 , principally determines how efficiently initial total potential energy of a galaxy merger can be converted into rotational energy rather than random kinetic energy during galaxy merging and thus how strongly the merger remnant is dynamically supported by global rotation .",
    "the dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath63 is described as @xmath82 @xmath14 @xmath116 .",
    "third , @xmath113 is larger for models with larger @xmath63 .",
    "this result indicates that galaxy mergers with rapid star formation become ellipticals with less strongly self - gravitation ( corresponding to larger @xmath113 ) .",
    "this is because in the model with larger @xmath63 , less amount of stellar component is transferred to the central region owing to less amount of kinetic energy dissipated away by gaseous dissipation during merging .",
    "the dependence of @xmath113 on @xmath63 is described as @xmath113 @xmath14 @xmath117 .",
    "what we should emphasize regarding the above results is that the exponent in the @xmath63 dependence for three terms , @xmath81 , @xmath118 , and @xmath113 are all positive .",
    "specifically , merger remnants with larger ratio of effective radius to gravitational radius are more likely to show both the smaller degree of global rotation and the smaller degree of self - gravitation of stellar component .",
    "since @xmath119 , this result means that these three terms cooperate to make the @xmath63 dependence of @xmath87 in merger remnants become stronger .",
    "this cooperation of three nonhomology parameters can be more clearly observed in figure 3 in which the @xmath81 dependence of @xmath118 and @xmath113 is described . as is shown in this figure , @xmath120 the @xmath118 and @xmath113 are larger for models with larger @xmath81 .",
    "this remarkable cooperation observed in the @xmath63 dependence of nonhomology parameters , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath113 , is first demonstrated in the present dissipative merger model , which is accordingly one of successes in the present study . as a natural result of the cooperation",

    "the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath63 is described as @xmath87 @xmath14 @xmath121 .",
    "thus the origin of structural and kinematical nonhomology of elliptical galaxies is demonstrated to be closely associated with the difference in the rapidity of star formation of galaxy mergers .",

    "the reason for this is that the degree of self - gravitation of stellar component in merger remnants is determined by the initial degree of self - gravitation of progenitor disks as well as by the rapidity of star formation .",
    "this result suggests that the diversity in the degree of self - gravitation actually observed in galactic disks ( e.g. saglia 1996 ) introduces a scatter in the scaling relation of the fp and thus that degree of self - gravitation of galactic disks should not be so different between merger progenitor for the considerably smaller dispersion in the fp .",

    "this is principally because in the models with smaller gas mass fraction ( @xmath45 = 0.1 ) , the rapidity of star formation can not affects so greatly the final structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants . as a result of this , the exponents @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are all smaller compared with those derived in other model groups , group a , b and c ( see the table 2 . ) .",

    "we here discuss how the @xmath63 should depend on the galactic luminosity ( @xmath12 ) for successful reproduction of the fp slope .",

    "probably the most plausible value of the exponent in the present study is 0.39 which is derived for model group e including all the dissipative merger models .",
    "this expected dependence of @xmath134 implies that if more luminous elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy mergers with more rapid star formation , the slope of the fp can be at least qualitatively explained in the present merger model .",
    "this result furthermore demonstrates that although a specific relation between star formation history of galaxy mergers and galactic luminosity is required , the origin of the fp slope can be closely associated with the star formation history of elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging .",

    "the results for the models in model 10 and 11 in which the initial ratio of dynamical mass to luminous mass is different from other models are not plotted , principally because these models in model 10 and 11 do not match with the adopted assumption of constant ratio of dynamical mass to luminous mass in progenitor disks ( actually , the results in model 10 and 11 are found to introduce an appreciably larger scatter in the reproduced fp . ) .",

    "( 1995 ) and djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and with an arbitrary zero point for the present model .",
    "the reproduced fp slope of merger remnants reflects the difference in total amount of gaseous dissipation , which is controlled greatly by the rapidity of star formation , among galaxy mergers .",
    "as is shown in this figure , there is an appreciable scatter in the fp .",
    "this result probably reflects either the uncertainty of the adopted scaling relations between the rapidity of star formation and galactic luminosity , or some defects of the present merger model , such as dissipative dynamics of interstellar gas , star formation model , and initial mass distribution and kinematics of merger progenitor .",
    "what we should stress here is that the reproduced fp in figure 10 is not exactly the same as the observed fp , the figure 10 suggests , however , that if a specific physical relation between the rapidity of star formation of galaxies and galactic luminosity @xmath149 exists , the fp can be reproduced in remnants of dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation .",
    "thus , our numerical results indicate that the slope of the fp reflects the difference in dissipative dynamics , which is probably controlled the most effectively by star formation history of galaxies , between elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging .",
    "although the importance of gaseous dissipation in reproducing the fp has been already suggested by several authors ( e.g. , djorgovski et al .",
    "1988 ; bender et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ) , the present numerical study , however , first demonstrated this importance in the context of star formation history of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the essentially important physics related to the origin of the fp is violent relaxation combined with gaseous dissipation in the present study . since the star formation history of galaxies , in particular , the rapidity of star formation , is a key determinant for the effectiveness of gaseous dissipation , the origin of the fp can be closely associated with the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "it is however not clarified in the present study whether this importance of galactic star formation history in the reproduction of the fp can be @xmath149 applied to more realistic situation of galaxy merging which is allowed by a specific cosmology and environment . accordingly",
    "we will investigate this importance more throughly by using more elaborated numerical simulations with more cosmologically plausible initial orbit configuration and more realistic initial physical conditions of merger progenitor .",
    "in the previous sections , we demonstrated that the rapidity of star formation ( @xmath63 ) can greatly affect both mass distribution and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "we furthermore suggested that if a specific dependence of the @xmath63 on galactic luminosity ( @xmath12 ) is satisfied like as @xmath134 among merger progenitor , the origin of the fp can be explained at least qualitatively in the present merger model .",
    "what we should stress here is that not the simple time - scale of gas consumption by star formation but the ratio of the dynamical time - scale of galaxies to the time - scale of gas consumption is found to be a key determinant for the reproduction of the fp .",
    "the reason for this importance of the time - scale ratio ( @xmath63 ) is that the @xmath63 can control the total amount of gaseous dissipation during galaxy merging , which is a primarily important factor for structure and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "this importance of the rapidity of star formation in explaining the origin of the fp is first pointed out in the present study .",
    "it has not been however clarified whether or not the expected relation of @xmath134 is astrophysically plausible and realistic .",
    "accordingly , it is our next step to assess the validity of the expected @xmath12 dependence of the @xmath63 in order that we confirm a close physical relation between the rapidity of the star formation and the origin of the fp .    to confirm the above important roles of the rapidity of star formation in the reproduction of the fp ,",
    "we must foremost know the dependence of time - scale of gas consumption by star formation on galactic luminosity . however , the dependence of star formation history of galaxies on galactic luminosity has not been so extensively examined in the previous observational studies .",
    "the reason for the smaller number of observational studies on the luminosity - dependent star formation history of galaxies is probably that characteristics of star formation history in galaxies have been generally considered to be more closely associated with the hubble type rather than the galactic luminosity or mass ( e.g. , sandage 1984 ; kennicutt 1992 ; larson 1992 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "only a few observational studies regarding the dependence of global color , surface density , and gas mass fraction on galactic luminosity in disk galaxies have been accumulated which suggest strongly that galactic luminosity or mass is a primarily important parameter which can control the whole history of galactic star formation ( see e.g. , gavazzi & scodeggio 1997 ; mcgaugh & blok 1997 ) .",
    "we accordingly await more extensive observational studies in order to explore more quantitatively the important roles of the rapidity of star formation in the creation of the fp .",
    "thus , it is still not clear whether the rapidity of star formation @xmath149 plays a vital role in creating the fp , the present numerical study , however , suggests strongly that both more extensive theoretical and observational studies concerning the dependence of galactic star formation history on galactic luminosity are doubtlessly worthwhile for better understanding of the origin of the fp .",
    "there are a number of previous studies in which main points on the origin of the fp slope are greatly different from those of the present study .",
    "hjorth & madsen ( 1995 ) constructed a self - consistent equilibrium model of elliptical galaxies and demonstrated that if the more luminous elliptical galaxies have the so - called @xmath19 light profile with larger @xmath20 , the slope of the fp can be successfully reproduced .",
    "they furthermore discussed that the origin of the fp slope can be understood in terms of dissipationless galactic dynamics , in particular , the physics of violent relaxation .",
    "capelato et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that initial orbital energy of merging systems is a primarily important factor for the radial profile of velocity dispersion and mass distribution of merger remnants , and thus for successful reproduction of the fp slope .",
    "based upon this result , they suggested that if the more luminous elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy merging with larger initial orbital energy , the fp can be reproduced successfully .",
    "levine ( 1997 ) discussed how the three basic variables in the fp should change in dissipationless merger events for the reconstruction or maintenance of the fp of elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging .",
    "the essential differences between the above previous studies and the present one are the following two .",
    "first , the dissipationless dynamics of galaxy merging is a primarily important factor in the previous works whereas the dissipative dynamics combined with galactic star formation is essential for the present merger model .",
    "second , the origin of the fp slope can be essentially ascribed to the difference of initial conditions of galaxy mergers with different luminosity or mass in the previous studies whereas the difference in star formation history between merging galaxies is reflected on the fp slope in the present merger model . since",
    "both the above previous studies and the present one are still in the preliminary stage of exploring the origin of the fp , it is safe for us to say that both merger models are actually promising candidates which provide valuable clues about the origin of the fp .",
    "what the above dissipationless and the present dissipative merger models should foremost address in the future studies is on whether these models can @xmath104-@xmath105 explain @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152 of elliptical galaxies such as the color - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "both the dissipationless and dissipative models at least in the preset stage seem to have a number of disadvantages or caveats for explaining both the origin of the fp and that of the other universal scaling relations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "further theoretical studies based on numerical simulation with variously different and astrophysically plausible initial conditions will point out more clearly advantages and disadvantages in explaining the origin of the fp for each of the two models .      our final goal is to construct a self - consistent model of elliptical galaxy formation which can explain not only the origin of the fp but also other fundamental characteristics observed in elliptical galaxies , such as the color - magnitude ( cm ) relation ( faber 1973 ; visvanathan & sandage 1977 ) , @xmath153 relation ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) , age - metal - conspiracy in stellar populations ( faber et al . 1995 ; worthey et al .",
    "1996 ) , kormendy - relation ( e.g. , djorgovski et al . 1996 ) , and dichotomy between boxy and disky elliptical galaxies ( kormendy & bender 1996 ) .",
    "thus it is essential for our future studies to confirm whether the derived relation between the rapidity of star formation and the galactic luminosity for the reproduction of the fp slope ( @xmath154 ) can also be essentially important for understanding the origin of the above fundamental characteristics of elliptical galaxies . in particular , it is the most important future study to discuss the validity of the derived @xmath12 dependence of @xmath155 in explaining also the origin of the cm relation , which is one of the most fundamental universal relations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "actually we have already obtained the result that even the origin of the cm relation can be closely associated with the rapidity of star formation of galaxy mergers ( bekki & shioya 1997 ) .",
    "however it has not yet been clarified throughly whether the @xmath12 dependence of the @xmath155 required for the reproduction of the fp is admittedly similar to that required for the cm relation .",
    "accordingly , we will investigate how the rapidity of star formation ( @xmath155 ) should depends on the galactic luminosity ( @xmath12 ) in order that both the origin of the fp and that of the cm relation can be reproduced successfully for the present merger model in a self - consistent manner .",
    "although the rapidity of star formation is probably not only the parameter which can explain the origin of fundamental scaling relations of elliptical galaxies , we consider that it is doubtlessly worthwhile to investigate the importance of the rapidity of star formation in generating scaling relations other than the fp in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have numerically investigated structural and kinematical properties of remnants of galaxy mergers between late - type spirals considerably abundant in interstellar gas in order to explore the origin of the fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we particularly considered that the origin of the slope of the fp is essentially due to the nonhomology in structure and kinematics of elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging with star formation .",
    "we found that the rapidity of star formation , which is defined as the ratio of dynamical time - scale of merger progenitor to the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation , is a key determinant for nonhomology parameters such as the density profile , the degree of global rotation , and the ratio of total dynamical mass to luminous mass , in merger remnants .",
    "this result strongly suggests that structural and kinematical nonhomology in elliptical galaxies can be closely associated with the difference in star formation history between elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging .",
    "this result implies that if a specific relation between the rapidity of star formation ( @xmath63 ) and galactic luminosity ( @xmath12 ) is satisfied like as @xmath134 , the required dependence of mass - to - light ratio on galactic mass in the fp ( the slope of the fp ) can be explained at least qualitatively in the present merger model .",
    "further extensive observational studies probably assess the validity of the expected @xmath12 dependence of the @xmath63 and thus determine whether or not the star formation history of merger progenitor galaxies can be a crucial factor for the creation of the fp .",
    "although the present merger model is indeed rather idealized and less realistic for @xmath44 dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation at higher redshift universe , it appears to have succeeded in demonstrating that the origin of the fp can reflect a close physical relation between galactic luminosity and star formation history of merger progenitor galaxies , in particular , the rapidity of star formation of galaxies .",
    "what we should emphasize here is that the proposed idea is only one of several promising ones in which physical meanings of the fp are extensively examined in variously different ways .",
    "probably , both the slope and the tightness of the fp contain more profound meanings on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies than we considered in the present study .",
    "thus , it is our future study to explore another promising candidates related to the origin of the fp , such as the age and metallicity difference of elliptical galaxies and hierarchy of galaxy merging .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for valuable comments , which contribute to improve the present paper",
    "thanks to the japan society for promotion of science ( jsps ) research fellowships for young scientist .",
    "the reason for the importance of the @xmath63 , which represents the time - scale of gas consumption relative to dynamical time - scale , is explained as follows .",
    "redistribution of mass and angular momentum of galaxy mergers , which is a crucial factor for structure and kinematics of merger remnants , can proceeds @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath73 @xmath71",
    "@xmath76 in galaxy mergers . dissipative dynamics of interstellar gas during galaxy merging greatly affects the redistribution of mass and angular momentum in galaxy mergers , as is demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations of barnes & hernquist ( 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "accordingly it is essential how greatly the gaseous dissipation can affect the redistribution process @xmath156 @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath73 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 . since , the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation basically determines the time - evolution of gas mass which is a key determinant for dissipative dynamics of interstellar gas , the ratio of the gas consumption time - scale to the dynamical time - scale is thus more essential for structure and kinematics of merger remnants .",
    "for example , if the dynamical time - scale is much larger than the gas consumption time - scale , star formation can proceed quite efficiently before the system reach the dynamical equilibrium , and consequently gaseous dissipation does not play a great role in determining the structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants .",
    "thus , since the gaseous dissipation can strongly affect the dynamical evolution of mergers which proceeds within the order of dynamical time - scale , the ratio of the above two time - scales are expected to be more essential for the structural and kinematical properties of merger remnants .",
    "we should emphasize here that for convenient , the @xmath160 ratio of the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation to the dynamical time - scale is referred to as the rapidity of star formation .",
    "we consider the @xmath63 to depend basically on galactic luminosity , as is described below .",
    "it has not been observationally clarified how the @xmath63 actually depends on galactic luminosity .",
    "accordingly we here give a simple order estimation for the luminosity dependence of the @xmath63 .",
    "the expected luminosity ( mass ) dependence of the @xmath63 is described as follows .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is set to be proportional to @xmath161/@xmath162 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the dynamical time - scale and the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation , respectively .",
    "we here define the mass of a galactic disk , the total mass of luminous and dark matter , and size of the progenitor as @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "we consider here that gas mass in a disk is equal to @xmath163 for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath161 is given as @xmath166 provided that the coefficient in the schmidt law is not dependent on the galactic mass ( or luminosity ) , we can derive @xmath162 as follows .",
    "@xmath167 where @xmath168 is the surface density of the gas disk .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 is the exponent of schmidt law , which is the same as that used in previous subsections . assuming the freeman s law and the constant ratio of @xmath165 to the scale length of exponential disk , we derive @xmath169 assuming that the degree of self - gravity of a galactic disk is described as @xmath170 then we can derive @xmath171 since @xmath172 is considered to have positive value ( @xmath173 : saglia 1996 )",
    ", this relationship predicts that @xmath63 becomes larger as @xmath163 increases .",
    "furthermore , if we assume the constant mass to light ratio for luminous matter , we can obtain the luminosity dependence of @xmath63 .",
    "alternatively , if we adopt the observed trend that more luminous disks have large surface density , such as @xmath174 ( mcgaugh & blok 1997 ) , we can obtain @xmath175 .",
    "these simple theoretical arguments accordingly suggest that larger ( or more luminous ) disk galaxies are more likely to have larger values of @xmath63 .",
    "it should be noted here that the derived @xmath12 ( or @xmath22 ) dependence of the @xmath63 is not necessarily plausible ( or realistic ) for @xmath44 galaxies owing to the lack of extensive observational studies on the luminosity dependence of the @xmath63 .",
