    "the past few years have witnessed an explosion of interest in discrete models that has been summarized in a number of recent reviews @xcite .",
    "this growth has been , to a large extent , motivated by numerous applications of nonlinear dynamical lattice models in areas as broad and diverse as the nonlinear optics of waveguide arrays @xcite , the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates in periodic potentials @xcite , micro - mechanical models of cantilever arrays @xcite , or even simple models of the complex dynamics of the dna double strand @xcite . arguably , the most prototypical model among the ones that emerge in these settings is the , so - called , discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite .",
    "dnls may arise as a direct model , as a tight binding approximation , or even as an envelope wave expansion : the dnls is one of the most ubiquitous models in the nonlinear physics of dispersive , discrete systems .",
    "perhaps the first set of experimental investigations that generated an intense interest in dnls type equations was in the area of nonlinear optics and , in particular , in fabricated algaas waveguide arrays @xcite . in the latter setting a wide range of phenomena such as discrete diffraction , peierls barriers ( the energetic barrier that a wave needs to overcome to move over a lattice see details below ) , diffraction management ( the periodic alternation of the diffraction coefficient ) @xcite and gap solitons ( structures localized due to nonlinearity in the gap of the underlying linear spectrum ) @xcite among others @xcite were experimentally observed .",
    "these phenomena , in turn , led to a large increase also on the theoretical side of the number of studies addressing such effectively discrete media .    a related area where dnls ,",
    "although it is not the prototypical model , it still yields useful predictions both about the existence and about the stability of nonlinear localized modes is that of optically induced lattices in photorefractive media such as strontium barium niobate ( sbn ) . since the theoretical inception of such a possibility in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its experimental realization in refs .",
    "@xcite , there has been an ever - expanding growth in the area of nonlinear waves and solitons in such periodic , predominantly two - dimensional , lattices .",
    "a wide array of structures has been predicted and experimentally observed in lattices induced with a self - focusing nonlinearity , including , e.g. , discrete dipole @xcite , quadrupole @xcite , necklace @xcite and other multi - pulse patterns ( such as e.g. , soliton stripes @xcite ) , discrete vortices @xcite , and rotary solitons @xcite . such structures have a definite potential to be used as carriers and conduits for data transmission and processing , in the setting of all - optical communication schemes .",
    "a recent review of this direction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , yet another independent and completely different physical setting where such considerations and structures are relevant is that of soft - condensed matter physics , where droplets of the most recently discovered state of matter , namely of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , may be trapped in an ( egg - carton ) optical lattice ( ol ) potential produced by counter - propagating laser beams in one , two or even all three directions @xcite .",
    "the field of bec has also experienced a huge growth over the past few years , including the prediction and manifestation of modulational instabilities ( i.e. , the instability of spatially uniform states towards spatially modulated ones ) @xcite , the observation of gap solitons @xcite , landau - zener tunneling ( tunneling between different bands of the periodic potential ) @xcite and bloch oscillations ( for matter waves subject to combined periodic and linear potentials ) @xcite among many other salient features ; reviews of the theoretical and experimental findings in this area have also recently appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while dnls combines two important features of many physical lattice systems , namely nonlinearity and periodicity , yet another element which is often physically relevant and rather ubiquitous is disorder .",
    "localized impurities are well - known in a variety of settings to introduce not only interesting wave scattering phenomena @xcite , but also to create the possibility for the excitation of impurity modes , which are spatially localized oscillatory states at the impurity sites @xcite . physical applications of such phenomena arise , e.g. , in superconductors @xcite , in the dynamics of the electron - phonon interactions @xcite , in the propagation of light in dielectric super - lattices with embedded defect layers @xcite or in defect modes arising in photonic crystals @xcite .    in the context of the dnls ,",
    "there have been a number of interesting studies in connection to the interplay of the localized modes with impurities .",
    "some of the initial works were either at a quasi - continuum limit ( where a variational approximation could also be implemented to examine this interplay ) @xcite or at a more discrete level but with an impurity in the coupling @xcite ( see also in the latter setting the more recent studies of a waveguide bend @xcite and the boundary defect case of ref .",
    "more recently the experimental investigations of refs .",
    "@xcite motivated the examinations of linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite defects in a dnls context . in the photorefractive context",
    ", further recent experimental work has illustrated blocking effects to a probe beam from either bright or dark soliton beams in defocusing waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to systematically examine the properties of the focusing dnls equation in the presence of both an attractive and a repulsive linear impurity .",
    "our first aim is to present the full bifurcation diagram of the localized modes in the presence of the impurity and how it is _ drastically _ modified in comparison to the case of the homogeneous lattice .",
    "the relevant bifurcations are quantified whenever possible even analytically , in good agreement with our full numerical computations .",
    "a second problem that is examined is that of the threshold for the formation of solitary waves and how it is _ systematically _ affected by the presence of impurities both in the repulsive and in the attractive case .",
    "this is motivated by the recent examination of the relevant threshold in the homogeneous lattice @xcite and its connection with experiments in focusing @xcite ( and even defocusing @xcite ) waveguide arrays . finally , in the same spirit as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but for attractive and repulsive impurities , we systematically investigate the interaction of an incoming solitary wave with the localized impurity , identifying the main observed regimes as being trapping , reflection with trapping , pure reflection and pure transmission .",

    "ii , we introduce the model . in section iii",

    "if @xmath64 is small enough , and @xmath85 high enough , transmission with no trapping occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ reflex ] ( bottom ) .",
    "there exists a critical value of @xmath109 that , if @xmath110 , the incident soliton crosses through the impurity .",
    "the value of @xmath111 grows with @xmath64 . in the case where @xmath112 , if @xmath63 , reflection with no trapping occurs , while if @xmath62 , trapping with no reflection phenomenon takes place .",
    "our results related to trapping , reflection and transmission phenomena are in agreement with some results recently obtained , using a different approach , in a similar system @xcite . in this work ,",
    "where approximate discrete moving solitons with fixed amplitude are generated using a continuous approximation , the authors study the trapping process by a linear and a nonlinear attractive impurity . in this latter framework , trapping can be explained by means of resonances with the linear localized mode . in our case , where nonlinear effects become stronger , all this phenomena are related with resonances with a nonlinear localized mode .",
    "finally , a very interesting phenomenon occurs when parameter @xmath11 is repulsive and small ( in absolute value ) enough . in this case , the solitary wave can be reflected or transmitted depending on its velocity .",
    "also , when it is reflected , our numerical tests show that its velocity is similar to its incident velocity .",
    "thus , if we consider the soliton as a `` quasiparticle '' , the effect of the impurity is similar to the effect of a potential barrier . to determine this potential barrier for a given value of parameter @xmath11 , we have used a method similar to the one described by ref .",
    "we have considered different values of the thrust parameter @xmath85 corresponding to the reflection regime , and determine , for each value , the turning point , @xmath113 .",
    "thus the translational energy of the barrier for this value of @xmath85 is defined as the difference between the energy ( [ ham ] ) of the moving soliton ( [ thrust ] ) and the stationary state ( [ stat ] ) of the same frequency far from the impurity .",
    "it can be written as @xmath114 , with @xmath115 being the lattice momentum , as defined in ref .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ barrier ] , which exhibits , as expected , an irregular shape , whose origin lies in the nonuniform behavior of the translational velocity due to the discreteness of the system .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the parameter @xmath11 is small enough , and positive ( attractive ) , the solitary wave faces a potential `` well '' and can be trapped if its translational energy is small or , if the translational energy is high enough , it may be transmitted , losing energy that remains trapped by the impurity , and decreasing its velocity .",
    "we have not found a regime with trapping and transmission as have also been observed in klein ",
    "gordon lattices @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have revisited the long - standing theme of the interactions of dnls localized modes with an impurity . in particular , we have examined both the case of attractive and repulsive impurities and have shown how localized modes bifurcate out of the linear spectrum in the presence of the impurity .",
    "subsequently , we have seen how _ drastically _ the bifurcation diagram of localized modes is affected by the presence of the impurity . in particular , we have concluded that for attractive impurities the on - site mode at the impurity eventually disappears , while for repulsive ones , it becomes unstable beyond a critical impurity strength .",
    "in addition , localized modes one site away from the impurity and beyond are also structurally affected and can not be sustained under strong ( either attractive or repulsive ) impurities . furthermore , we have seen how the presence of the impurity significantly modifies the threshold for the formation of localized modes , under a compactum of initial data .",
    "attractive impurities favor the formation of such a mode under weaker excitations , while repulsive ones necessitate an even higher amplitude threshold .",
    "finally , we have examined in detail for both impurity cases ( attractive and repulsive ) the interaction of the impurity with a moving localized mode initiated away from it .",
    "the principal regimes that we have identified as a function of the impurity strength ( and sign ) and initial speed are trapping , partial trapping and partial reflection , pure reflection and pure transmission . in general , if the impurity is repulsive , and the speed small enough , the wave is always reflected .",
    "if the impurity strength ( in absolute value ) is small enough and the speed is high enough , then transmission can take place .",
    "on the other hand , if impurity is attractive , trapping can occur , and if the speed is high enough trapping with reflection too .",
    "if impurity is attractive and sufficiently strong , the frequency of the soliton is smaller than the one corresponding to the linear localized impurity mode and the wave is reflected .",
    "there are numerous avenues that one can think of for further exploration of this subject . on the one hand",
    ", we feel that numerous among the conclusions of the present work including ones about the unavailability of localization on or at nearby sites to the impurity for sufficiently high strengths , or ones about the threshold for localized modes should be immediately experimentally testable in arrays of optical waveguides . on the other hand , this type of wave - impurity interactions have been predominantly studied in one - dimensional systems .",
    "however , the present availability of two - dimensional waveguide arrays renders this a very interesting system for examining the relevant interaction in multi - dimensional frameworks , even from a theoretical point of view and the examination of both the standing wave and of the scattering problems .",
    "the latter problem is currently under investigation and will be reported in future publications .",
