    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) in @xmath0 dimensions arises in many descriptions of physical phenomena which range from the water waves and wave propagation in fibre optics to biophysics @xcite .",
    "moreover , being perhaps the simplest nonlinear pde , it has been studied a lot by both mathematicians and physicists .",
    "in particular the equation was shown to be integrable and that it has soliton - like solutions @xcite .",
    "most of this work involved the simplest version of the equation - in which the nonlinearity was in the form of a simple power of the field itself .",
    "the equation has also been extended in many ways ; people looked at the effects of the additions of higher powers of the fields and of their derivatives .",
    "some of these generalisations involved also nonlocal terms .",
    "in fact , some of them , in the optics literature , go under the name of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . due to its general nature",
    "the equation has been used in many applications .",
    "recently these generalisations involving a nonlocal nonlinear term have been used in the description of the bose - einstein condensates below the transition temperature @xcite . in this case the external potential models the trap for the particles , while the nonlocal interaction describes the interaction between the bosons in the condensate .",
    "the nonlocal equation has also recently been used to describe wave dynamics in media with a large response length , _",
    "e.g. _ in nonlinear optics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the nonlocal equation was also studied some time ago by ginibre and velo @xcite who , in their mathematical paper , proved that some nonlocal schrdinger equations possess well defined solutions .",
    "this proof did not give any details of their nature , _",
    "i.e. _ it did not answer the question whether the solutions represent solitons and what their properties are .",
    "more recently abe and ogawa @xcite looked at the nonlocal version of the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath0 dimensions for a class of nonlinear terms involving a power - law interaction .",
    "they demonstrated the existence of solitonic solutions and then , using a gaussian approximation , studied the dependence of the width of the solitons on the exponent of the power - law interaction .",
    "however , the study did not include the cases of a coulomb or yukawa interactions . in @xcite",
    "the study was extended to more than one spatial dimension using an exponential - type nonlocal interaction .",
    "given that in most applications the nonlocal term comes from the interaction of some ( spread - out ) physical charges we have decided to have another look at this equation for the cases of coulomb - and yukawa - like interactions .    in this paper , we present the results of our studies of a system in one spatial dimension with nonlocal interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ when the kernel of the nonlocal term is given by @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we introduce all the notations and present the model . in sections iii and iv , respectively , we discuss the cases of the coulomb - and yukawa interactions . in each section",
    "we present the numerically obtained results for the existence of solitons and their properties and then present some analytic arguments based a gaussian approximation which allow us to explain these results .",
    "we finish with some conclusions in section v.",
    "the action of the model in @xmath0 dimensions , which we have studied , is given by : @xmath3\\,+\\ ] ] @xmath4 and the corresponding equation reads : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the kernel of the non - local interaction of the system . for @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the `` local '' limit , ( [ nnls ] ) reduces to the usual non - linear schrdinger equation , which is known to possess soliton solutions , while the case @xmath8 , @xmath9 was studied in @xcite . here , we are interested in the physically more relevant coulomb and yukawa - type interactions which lie outside the range of potentials studied in @xcite .",
    "note that the system possesses some conserved quantities , like the energy which is given by : @xmath10 and the intensity ( or the number of particles ) @xmath11 which , in this work , for convenience , we have set equal to one .",
    "often we can `` undo ''",
    "this setting of @xmath12 by an appropriate scaling of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "first we consider a coulomb - type interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ the case of @xmath16 .    clearly the equation ( [ nnls ] ) is too hard to solve analytically .",
    "however , we expect it to have solitonic solutions .",
    "note that both terms in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , due to the @xmath17 sign in @xmath18 , are positive but their roles are very different ; the first term tends to spread the field while the second one tends to focus it .",
    "hence we expect the interplay of both terms to lead to a stable ( stationary ) solution which minimises the hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "what is this solution like ? clearly ,",
    "to get some intuition for its shape we can try a gaussian of the form : @xmath20 if this approximation is relevant then the height of the soliton , defined here as the max of @xmath21 , in this ansatz is proportional to @xmath22 , which is a free parameter in ( [ gauss ] ) , while its width is proportional to @xmath23 .    inserting ( [ gauss ] ) into ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we find that @xmath24 the value of the parameter @xmath22 which minimises the energy then is given by @xmath25 note that increasing strength of the nonlocal interaction @xmath26 , the height of the soliton ( given by @xmath27 ) increases and the width ( given by @xmath23 ) decreases . for @xmath28 ( the case of the `` pure '' _ i.e. _ linear schrdinger equation ) , no localised structures appear , as expected .",
    "note that , as expected , ( [ energy_coulomb ] ) shows that the energy of the approximate solution consists of two terms which exhibit a different behaviour when one varies @xmath22 . to predict the dependence of the minimal energy on the coupling @xmath26 , we insert ( [ coulomb_height ] ) into ( [ energy_coulomb ] ) and find that @xmath29      next we have checked how good our predictions based on the gaussian approximation really are . to do this we have performed several numerical calculations using a fourth - order runge - kutta method for simulating the time evolution .",
    "of course the @xmath13-variable has been discretised and we have typically used 500 lattice points .",
    "= 9.0 cm +    we have used several starting field configurations .",
    "most of our simulations involved starting with a strongly localised structure , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "then we took the energy out of the system by adding a small dissipative term into ( [ nnls ] ) having first taken most of the explicit time dependence of @xmath33 into account by writing @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 can be calculated from ( [ nnls ] ) , and really only evolving the equation for @xmath36 .",
    "in consequence , the system evolved into a static equation for @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e. _ a stationary solution field equation for @xmath33",
    ".    a typical soliton solution is shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( it corresponds to @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have found that the final stationary configurations were very well localised even for small values of @xmath26 .",
    "next we studied the dependence of the height and of the energy of the stationary solution as a function of the nonlocal coupling constant @xmath26 .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "= 9.0 cm +    clearly , we have found that soliton solutions exist for all values of the nonlocal coupling @xmath26 .",
    "fitting our numerical data for the height of the soliton , we see that @xmath39 for @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 for @xmath42 $ ] . for the energy , we have @xmath43 for @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath44 for @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "thus for small values of @xmath26 our numerical results agree extremely well with the predictions based on the gaussian approximation - given by the expressions in ( [ coulomb_height ] ) and ( [ energy2 ] ) .",
    "next we have looked at a yukawa - type interaction , for which we have @xmath45 . note that @xmath46 corresponds to the case of the coulomb - interaction studied above .",
    "this time it is even harder to get any analytical results .",
    "so , again we look at a gaussian approximation",
    ". thus we insert ( [ gauss ] ) into ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and find that @xmath47 with @xmath48 \\left(1 +   \\exp\\left[2\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha } x'\\right ] \\nonumber \\right.\\,+ \\\\ & + & \\left .",
    "{ \\rm erf}\\left[x'-\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\alpha}\\right ] - { \\rm erf}\\left[x'+\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\alpha}\\right ] \\exp\\left[2\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha } x'\\right]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where erf is the errorfunction .",
    "the value of this integral has to be evaluated numerically .",
    "we find that _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ we see that for fixed @xmath52 , the value of the integral increases with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "the energy thus decreases with the increasing height of the approximate soliton .    to be able to give arguments on how the height of the soliton depends on the coupling @xmath52 , we expand the exponential for small @xmath52 as @xmath53 neglecting @xmath54-terms",
    ", we obtain for the energy @xmath55 where the second term on the rhs is a constant piece that is not important for the arguments that follow .",
    "the value of @xmath22 that minimises the energy fulfills the equation @xmath56 since the expressions for the roots of this equation are complicated , we evaluate the required value of @xmath22 by comparing it to the solution in the case when @xmath46 _ i.e. _ @xmath57 .",
    "thus we put @xmath58 and inserting this into ( [ eq2 ] ) we find that @xmath59 this tells us that for fixed values of @xmath26 , the height of the soliton",
    "_ decreases _ with @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , in the linear approximation in @xmath52 , the correction to the height does nt depend on the strength of the nonlocal coupling @xmath26 .",
    "= 9.0 cm +    again , as in the coulombic case , we have studied this problem numerically using the same procedures as before . in",
    "all studied cases we have found solitonic - like stationary solutions .",
    "next we have looked at the properties of these solutions .",
    "we have fixed @xmath26 and have tried to determine the height and the energy of the stationary soliton as a function of the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "we have found that in all cases the soliton height decreases as one increases @xmath52 . in fig.[fig3 ] we present our results for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . as predicted by our analytic argument ( [ yukawa_height ] )",
    ", we observe that the height of the soliton decreases linearly with @xmath52 and that the two curves are parallel to each other indicating the independence of the decrease on @xmath26 .    in fig.[fig4 ] , we show the energy of the solutions as a function of @xmath52 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that when we have added the constant piece @xmath62 to the energy ( compare also ( [ energy_yukawa ] ) ) , in order to make the energy finite for @xmath46 , the energy also decreases . for @xmath46",
    ", the yukawa interaction reduces to the coulomb interaction , while for @xmath63 we obtain the case of the `` pure '' schrdinger equation .",
    "we would thus expect the height and the rescaled energy to tend to the values found in the coulomb case for @xmath64 and our numerical results confirm this .",
    "moreover , for @xmath65 , there is no localised structure and so the height and the energy , as expected , tend to zero .",
    "we have studied a class of nonlinear schrdinger models in which the nonlinear term involves nonlocal interactions based on coulomb or yukawa like potentials .",
    "we have shown that , like the more familiar local nonlinear schrdinger model , these models also possess solitonic - like stationary solutions for all values of the coupling constant .",
    "all solutions in the yukawa case are less localised than the corresponding coulombic solutions . as expected , when one increases the strength of the potential the solitons become more localised .",
    "the solitonic fields look a little like gaussians ; in fact an approximation of them by a gaussian is very reliable .",
    "we have calculated various properties of the solitons based on this approximation and have found them to be in a good agreement with what we have seen in our simulations of the full equations .    in @xcite",
    "a similar gaussian approximation was successfully applied to the problems involving a local nonlinear term ( but involving derivatives ) in many dimensions .",
    "would this be the case when we look at nonlocal terms in two or even three spatial dimensions ?",
