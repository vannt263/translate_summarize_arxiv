    "the pion production processes from nucleons and nuclei at intermediate energies are important tools to study the hadronic structure .",
    "the dynamic models of the hadronic structure are used to calculate the various nucleon and transition form factors which are tested by using the experimental data on photo , electro and weak pion production processes on nucleons . the weak pion production along with the electro pion production from nucleon in the @xmath3-resonance region is used to determine the various electroweak @xmath4 transition form factors .",
    "the neutrino induced pion production experiments performed at cern@xcite , anl@xcite and bnl@xcite laboratories have been analyzed to obtain informations on these form factors .",
    "the early neutrino experiments performed at cern[1 ] have low statistics and are done using heavy nuclear targets and their analysis have uncertainties related to the nuclear corrections .",
    "the later experiments performed at anl@xcite and bnl@xcite are done in hydrogen and deuterium and are free from nuclear medium corrections .",
    "these experiments also have high statistics and provide reasonable estimates of the dominant form factors in @xmath4 transitions .",
    "however , with the availability of the new neutrino beams in intermediate energies at k2k@xcite and miniboone@xcite , it is desirable that various @xmath5 weak transition form factors are determined for low lying nuclear resonances like @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc .",
    "there is a considerable activity in this field , specially , in the determination of electromagnetic transition form factors using the photo and electroproduction data from mainz , bonn and tjnaf laboratories@xcite .",
    "it is desirable that such attempts be extended to the determination of weak transition form factors also .",
    "-flux for kamioka site[7 ] ]    recently , the weak pion production processes have become very important in the analysis of the neutrino oscillation experiments with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the energy spectrum of atmospheric neutrino at kamioka site@xcite , shown in fig.1 is such that the weak pion production contributes about @xmath9 of the quasielastic lepton production and is a major source of uncertatinty in the identification of electron and muon events .",
    "in particular , the neutral current @xmath10 production contributes to the background of @xmath11 production while @xmath12 production contributes to the background of @xmath13 production .",
    "this is because both the particles i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 are identified through the detection of photons and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are identified through single track events in the detection of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "moreover , the neutral current @xmath10 production plays very important role in distinguishing between the two oscillation mechanisms @xmath14 and @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillation experiments are generally performed with detectors which use material with nuclei like @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc . as targets .",
    "it is therefore desirable that nuclear medium effects be studied in the production of leptons and pions induced by the atmospheric as well accelerator neutrinos used in these neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "there have been many attempts in past to calculate the weak pion production@xcite , but very few attempts have been made to estimate the nuclear effects and their influence on the weak pion production in nuclei@xcite .",
    "the recent experiments on neutrino oscillation experiments with atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos in the intermediate energy region have started a fresh interest in the study of weak pion production of pions from nuclei@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we report in this paper the results of a calculation of the weak pion production in nucleus assuming @xmath3 dominance .",
    "the effect of pauli blocking , fermi motion and renormalisation of weak @xmath3 properties in the nuclear medium are taken into account in a local density approximation following the methods of ref.@xcite .    in section-2",
    ", we describe the matrix elements for the production of @xmath3 resonance from free nucleons using the information about the @xmath4 transition form factors as determined from experiments .",
    "these matrix elements are then used to calculate the weak pion production in nuclei .",
    "we have described and discussed the incoherent weak production of pions in section-3 and the coherent weak pion production in section-4 with conclusion given in section-5 .",
    "the weak pion production processes like @xmath16 and @xmath17 where n can be a proton or neutron and @xmath18 are the different possible charged states ( @xmath19 and @xmath10 ) of the pions produced and are determined by the lepton number and charge conservation in the charged current and neutral current reactions in eqns.(1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",
    "the pion production induced by charged current neutrino interaction is calculated in the standard model of electroweak interactions using the lagrangian given by @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the hadronic current given by @xmath23 for the charged current reactions .",
    "the matrix element of the hadronic current @xmath24 is generally calculated using the nucleon and meson exchanges and the resonance excitation diagrams .",
    "however , it has been shown that in the intermediate energy region of about 1gev , the dominant contribution to the pion production from nucleons as well as from nuclei comes from the @xmath3 resonance due to very strong p wave pion nucleon coupling leading to @xmath3 resonance .",
    "furthermore , the angular distribution and the energy distribution of the pions is dominated by the @xmath3 contribution while the other diagrams contribute to the tail region due to the interference of the nucleon and meson exchange diagrams with the @xmath3 resonance diagram@xcite .    in this model",
    "the matrix element for the neutrino excitation of the @xmath3 resonance through charged current reaction i.e. @xmath25 @xmath26 is written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the leptonic current and @xmath29 and @xmath30 defines the vector and axial vector part of the transition hadronic current between @xmath31 and @xmath3 states for the charged current interaction .",

    "the vector form factors @xmath39(i=3 - 6 ) are determined by using the conserved vector current(cvc ) hypothesis which gives @xmath41=0 and relates @xmath42(i=3,4,5 ) to the electromagnetic form factors which are determined from photoproduction and electroproduction of @xmath3 s . using the analysis of these experiments@xcite,@xcite we take for the vector form factors @xmath43 the axial vector form factor @xmath44 is related to @xmath45 using pcac and",
    "is given by @xmath46 the remaining axial vector form factor @xmath47 are taken from the experimental analysis of the neutrino experiments producing @xmath3 s in proton and deuteron targets@xcite-@xcite .",

    "the step function @xmath63 denotes the fact that the width is zero for the invariant masses below the @xmath64 threshold .",
    "@xmath65 is the pion momentum in the rest frame of the resonance .",
    "the reaction given in eqns.4 and 5 taking place in the nucleus produces @xmath32 or @xmath66 which give rise to pions as decay product through @xmath67 channel . in the incoherent pion production process only these pions are observed and no observation is made on other hadrons .",
    "however , in the nucleus there is a possibility , that the @xmath3 produced in the reaction decays producing a pion such that the nucleus stays in the ground state .",
    "this leads to the process of coherent production of pions which are characterized by the forward production of pions in the direction of the lepton momentum transfer as the recoil of the nucleus is very small and negligible .    in the following",
    "we discuss separately the incoherent and coherent production of pions in nuclei .",
    "when the reaction given by eqns.4 or 5 takes place in the nucleus , the neutrino interacts with the nucleon moving inside the nucleus of density @xmath68 with its corresponding momentum @xmath69 constrained to be below its fermi momentum @xmath70^\\frac{1}{3}$ ] , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the neutron and proton nuclear densities .",

    "these @xmath73 decay through various decay channels in the medium .",
    "the production of @xmath3 in the nucleus , leads to pion as it decays into nucleon and pion through @xmath74 channel .",
    "however , these nucleons have to be above the fermi momentum @xmath75 of the nucleon in the nucleus thus inhibiting the decay as compared to the free decay of the @xmath3 described by @xmath59 in eqn.12 . therefore , in the nuclear medium the decay width @xmath59 in eqn.15 is to be modified in the nuclear medium .",
    "the modification of @xmath59 due to pauli blocking of nucleus has been studied in detail in electromagnetic and strong interactions@xcite .",
    "the modified @xmath3 decay width i.e. @xmath76 is written as@xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the pauli correction factor given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the fermi momentum , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the @xmath3 momentum and @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , in the nuclear medium there are additional decay channels now open due to two body and three body absorption processes like @xmath84 and @xmath85 through which @xmath73 disappear in the nuclear medium without producing a pion while a two body @xmath3 absorption process like @xmath86 gives rise to some more pions .",
