    "measurements on collective flow in heavy ion collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite showed that the matter produced , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is a nearly perfect fluid @xcite . because the strength of the collective flow increases with decreasing viscosity , indirect extractions of the shear viscosity have recently been performed by tuning the shear viscosity ( or the qcd coupling ) as a parameter in viscous hydrodynamic @xcite and transport models @xcite to match the elliptic flow @xmath0 .",
    "a consistent result has been achieved : on a conservative basis the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio @xmath4 of the qcd matter at rhic is less than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "uncertainties stem from assumptions in modelling the various stages that the matter undergoes during its evolution .    the results from the transport calculations using the boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ( bamps ) @xcite showed that @xmath3 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath2 is lower and the @xmath2 spectra are harder than the experimental data , whereas the integral of both gives a @xmath2 averaged @xmath0 , which matches the experimental data .",
    "this inconsistency may stem from the nature of the rather complicated hadronization process than the simple parton - hadron duality picture used in @xcite .",
    "another reason may lie in the fact that only gluons are considered as interacting constituents in the calculations presented in @xcite . including quark dynamics will increase the number of parton degrees of freedom and , thus , may soften the @xmath2 spectra and enhance @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we employ bamps and include effective quark degrees of freedom to investigate how the increase and the equilibration of partonic multiplicities affect the elliptic flow and also the @xmath4 ratio of the qgp .",
    "this study shall demonstrate whether the buildup of elliptic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions depends on the chemical equilibration of gluons and quarks .",
    "the latter determines the actual number of constituents in the partonic phase .",
    "in hydrodynamic calculations it is assumed that the matter stays in chemical equilibrium and thus the number of constituents is conserved .",
    "however , the situation in a real heavy ion collision might be considerably more complicated @xcite .",
    "quarks are expected to achieve chemical equilibrium ( if this occurs ) later than gluons @xcite . even for gluons",
    "only , the chemical equilibration will proceed faster at the collision center than at the region near transverse edge of the parton system .",
    "the parton chemical equilibration can well be studied using the microscopic transport model with multiple scatterings such as bamps @xcite , because bamps implements perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) elastic collisions as well as the pqcd based inelastic bremsstrahlung incorporating full detailed balance .",

    "[ v2 t ] .    the resulting smaller difference in the total transport collision rates than that in the total collision rates ( when varying @xmath30 from @xmath31 to @xmath42 ) stems from the time evolution of the screening mass @xmath98 [ see eq .",

    "the reason is that for the same initial condition the system with @xmath58 is initially farther apart from full chemical equilibrium than the system with @xmath10 ( see fig .",

    "the production of more particles from the same energy content leads to a smaller temperature at the ( chemical ) freeze - out .",

    "<S> we calculate the elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 for au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev employing the parton cascade bamps ( boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ) . besides gluon interactions including the bremsstrahlung process , interactions with quarks are considered in an effective , but approximate way to investigate the dependence of the collective flow on the number of parton degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath2 is sensitive to the number of parton degrees of freedom , whereas the @xmath2 averaged @xmath0 does not . when including quarks , @xmath3 shifts to lower @xmath2 , the parton transverse momentum spectra become softer and the mean parton transverse momenta decrease </S>"
