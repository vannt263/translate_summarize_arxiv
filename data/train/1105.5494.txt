    "the possibility of kaon bound states in nuclei  @xcite has been intensely discussed recently  @xcite and is one of the central subjects in forthcoming experiments at japan proton accelerator research complex e15  @xcite , fopi at gsi  @xcite , and amadeus at da@xmath6ne  @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical concept to describe kaonic nuclei is the two - body @xmath2-@xmath0 interaction , which closely relates to the description of the @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath5 amplitude .",
    "theoretical models of the @xmath2-@xmath0 scattering amplitudes have been constrained by the total cross sections of low - energy @xmath7 scattering into various final states and the threshold branching ratios of the @xmath7 channel .",
    "recently , due to intensive experimental activities , new data of the @xmath0 invariant mass distributions are becoming available , and the analysis of the energy level and width of the kaonic hydrogen provides precise information regarding the @xmath7 scattering length  @xcite .    in this way , there are many experimental data around the @xmath2 threshold , while the amplitude at far below the threshold is not well constrained .",
    "this means that the @xmath2-@xmath0 interaction relevant to the study of the @xmath8-nucleus systems with strong binding is achieved only through the subthreshold extrapolation from the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "for instance , the chiral unitary model  @xcite , a coupled - channels approach with the low - energy interaction constrained by chiral symmetry , has revealed an interesting two - pole structure  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the nominal @xmath1 resonance is not a single state but a superposition of two states with different properties .",
    "it is shown that this two - pole structure has substantial influence for the @xmath2 interaction  @xcite and the @xmath9-@xmath10 system  @xcite .",
    "however , it is found that the position of the lower energy pole is sensitive to the details of the model , due to the lack of the information of the @xmath0 interaction  @xcite .",
    "the scattering length characterizes the property of the two - body interaction .",
    "the attractive / repulsive nature of the interaction is reflected in the sign of the scattering length .",
    "the magnitude is sensitive to the singularity of the amplitude close to the threshold .",
    "if there is a bound ( virtual ) state , the scattering length becomes large and negative ( positive ) , as is known for the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 scattering  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath2-@xmath0 interaction ,",
    "it is shown that the position of the lower energy pole of @xmath1 is closely related to the @xmath0 scattering length with isospin @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to determine the @xmath14 scattering length to impose further constraints on the low - energy @xmath2-@xmath0 interaction .",
    "there are several ways to extract the hadron scattering length in experiments .",
    "the standard method is to measure the energy shift and the width of the hadronic atom state  @xcite or to extrapolate the low - energy phase - shift data down to the threshold  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both methods can not be applied to the @xmath0 case .",
    "recently , an alternative method to determine hadron scattering lengths was proposed by cabibbo  @xcite , in which the cusp effect at the @xmath15 threshold is used to extract the @xmath4 scattering length in the @xmath16 decay .",
    "the structure around the cusp at the @xmath17 threshold is related to the scattering amplitude of the @xmath18 process , which is nothing but the @xmath4 scattering length ( the relationship between the scattering length and the cusp phenomena in the @xmath4 spectrum has been discussed also in ref .",
    "the cusp effect is indeed observed in the high - statistics experimental data  @xcite which leads to the determination of the @xmath4 scattering length .    in this paper , we propose to apply a similar methodology to the @xmath0 scattering lengths by use of the @xmath3 decays .",
    "this decay process has been measured as the @xmath19 peak in the three - body invariant mass spectrum in refs .",
    "the branching ratios to the relevant decay channels are reported as a few percents by the particle data group ( pdg )  , so the extraction would be feasible at belle and babar where a huge amount of @xmath20 is produced .",

    "we review the general argument of the determination of the scattering length from the threshold cusp effect and summarize the possible @xmath0 channels in the @xmath20 decay where we have a chance to observe the cusp structure .",
    "we then discuss the method to extract the scattering length with minimal model assumptions by expanding the amplitude in terms of the momentum variable .",

    "in both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 modes , the effect of the @xmath5 component is reflected in the cusp structure , so these modes can be used to extract the isosinglet scattering length .",
    "a nice feature of the @xmath49 mode is the large branching fraction of the decay ( @xmath863.6% ) which is advantageous for the experimental observation . on the other hand ,",

    "the @xmath51 mode is not useful to extract the @xmath5 component , and the expected cusp structure seems to be relatively weak .",
    "in addition , observing two neutral pions in the final state would be experimentally difficult .",
    "nevertheless , once the precise decay spectrum is observed , this mode serves as a precise test of the chpt prediction for the scattering lengths in @xmath70 and @xmath63 channels .    in order to estimate the accuracy of the spectrum measurement for the feasible determination of the scattering length , we consider the deviation of the spectrum from the phase - space distribution @xmath87 for a given @xmath88 , the magnitude of this deviation provides the lower limit of the experimental accuracy to extract the scattering length .",
