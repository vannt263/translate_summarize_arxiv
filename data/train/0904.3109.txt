    "a quantum spin hall insulator ( qshi ) is a time reversal invariant two dimensional electronic phase which has a bulk energy gap generated by the spin orbit interaction@xcite .",
    "it has a topological order@xcite which requires the presence of gapless edge states similar to those that occur in the integer quantum hall effect . in the simplest version",
    ", the qshi can be understood as two time reversed copies of the integer quantum hall state@xcite for up and down spins .",
    "the edge states , which propagate in opposite directions for the two spins , form a unique one dimensional system in which elastic backscattering is forbidden by time reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "this state occurs in hgcdte quantum well structures@xcite , and experiments have verified the basic features of the edge states , including the landauer conductance@xcite @xmath10 , as well as the non locality of the edge state transport@xcite .    in the presence of electron interactions , the edge states form a luttinger liquid@xcite . for strong interactions ( when the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath11 ) random two particle backscattering processes destabilize the edge states , leading to an anderson localized phase . for @xmath12 ( or a sufficiently clean system ) , however , one expects the characteristic power law behavior for tunneling of a luttinger liquid .",
    "a powerful tool for probing edge state transport experimentally is to make a quantum point contact . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a , b ) , a gate voltage controls the coupling between edge states on either side of a hall bar as the point contact is pinched off .",
    "recently , the point contact problem for a qshi has been studied@xcite .",
    "hou , kim and chamon@xcite made the interesting observation that the qshi problem maps to an earlier studied model@xcite of a weak link in a spinful luttinger liquid ( sll ) , in which the charge and spin luttinger parameters are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently strong interactions ( @xmath9 ) they found that the simple perfectly transmitting and perfectly reflecting phases are both unstable .",
    "they showed that as long as spin is conserved at the junction the low energy behavior is dominated by a non trivial  mixed \" fixed point of the sll , in which charge is reflected but spin is perfectly transmitted .",
    "this charge insulator / spin conductor ( ic ) phase leads to a novel structure in the four terminal conductance of the point contact .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the qshi point contact for weaker interactions , when @xmath15 . in this regime the open limit ( or weak backscattering ,  small @xmath16 \" ) and the pinched off limit ( or weak tunneling ,  small @xmath17 \" ) are _ both _ stable perturbatively .",
    "this is different from the behavior in an ordinary luttinger liquid@xcite or a fractional quantum hall point contact@xcite . in those cases",
    "the perfectly transmitting limit is unstable for @xmath18 .",
    "weak backscattering is relevant and grows at low energy , leading to a crossover to the stable perfectly reflecting fixed point .",
    "the fact that both the small @xmath16 and the small @xmath17 limits are stable for the qshi point contact means that there must be an intermediate unstable fixed point which separates the flows to the two limits .",
    "this unstable fixed point describes a quantum critical point where the point contact switches on as a function of the pinch - off gate voltage .",
    "we will argue that in the limit of zero temperature the point contact switches on abruptly as a function of gate voltage @xmath19 , with conductance @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . at finite but low temperature @xmath24 ,",
    "the shape of the pinch - off curve @xmath25 is controlled by the crossover between the unstable and stable fixed points , and is described by a universal crossover scaling function , @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a non universal constant .",
    "@xmath29 is a critical exponent describing the unstable intermediate fixed point .",
    "@xmath30 is a universal function which crosses over between @xmath31 and @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are completely determined by the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior means that as temperature is lowered , the pinch - off curve as a function of @xmath19 sharpens up with a characteristic width which vanishes as @xmath34 , as shown schematically in fig . [ fig1](c ) .",
    "the curves at different low temperatures cross at @xmath35 , the conductance of the critical point .",
    "[ scalingform ] predicts that data from different temperatures can be rescaled to lie on the same universal curve .",
    "the crossover scaling function @xmath30 is similar to the scaling function that controls the lineshape of resonances in a luttinger liquid@xcite and in a fractional quantum hall point contact@xcite . that scaling function was computed exactly for all @xmath5 by fendley , ludwig and saleur@xcite using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz .",
    "that problem , however , was simpler than ours because the critical point occurs at the weak backscattering limit , which is described by a boundary conformal field theory with a trivial boundary condition@xcite .",
    "the intermediate fixed point relevant to our problem has no such simple description .",
    "thus , even the critical point properties @xmath29 and @xmath36 ( which were simple for the resonance problem ) are highly nontrivial to determine .",
    "intermediate fixed points in luttinger liquid problems were first discussed in refs . and",
    "in the context of slls .",
    "however , for that problem they occur in a rather unphysical region of parameter space @xmath37 , because spin rotational invariance requires @xmath38 . to our knowledge",
    ", the qshi point contact provides the first physically viable system to directly probe these non trivial fixed points .",
    "the existence of the intermediate fixed points can be inferred from the stability of the simple perfectly transmitting or reflecting fixed points@xcite .",
    "however their properties are difficult to compute , and a general characterization of these critical points remains an unsolved problem in conformal field theory@xcite .",
    "two approaches have been used to study their properties . in ref .",
    ", a perturbative approach was introduced which applies when the luttinger parameters are close to their critical values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where the simple fixed points become unstable .",
    "( for instance , for the weak backscattering limit , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) . for @xmath43 , the fixed point is accessible in perturbation theory about the simple fixed point , and it s properties can be computed in a manner analogous to the @xmath44 expansion in statistical mechanics .",
    "an alternative approach is to map the theory for specific values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 onto solvable models . in ref .",
    ", yi and kane recast the luttinger liquid barrier problem as a problem of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) in a two dimensional periodic potential .",
    "when @xmath47 , @xmath48 and the potential has minima with a honeycomb lattice symmetry , a stable intermediate fixed point which occurs in that problem was identified with that of the 3 channel kondo problem .",
    "this , in turn is related to the solvable @xmath49 wess zumino witten model@xcite , allowing for a complete characterization of the fixed point .",
    "this idea was further developed by affleck , oshikawa and saleur@xcite , who provided a more general characterization of the fixed point in terms of the boundary conformal field theory of the three state pott s model . for @xmath50 and @xmath51 the qbm model with triangular lattice symmetry",
    "has an unstable intermediate fixed point , which we will see is related to the fixed point of the qshi problem . in ref .",
    "symmetry arguments were exploited to determine the critical conductance @xmath52 in that case .    in this paper",
    "we will compute @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( along with a multiterminal generalization of the conductance ) in three solvable limits :    _ ( i ) _ for @xmath2 , we will perform an expansion for weak electron interactions . for non interacting electrons",
    "the point contact can be characterized in terms of a scattering matrix @xmath53 , for arbitrary transmission .",
    "weak interactions lead to a logarithmic renormalization of @xmath53 . following the method developed by matveev , yue and glazman@xcite , this allows @xmath30 and @xmath29 to be calculated exactly in the limit @xmath54 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ for @xmath55 we find that the intermediate fixed point approaches the charge insulator / spin conductor fixed point , allowing for a perturbative calculation of the fixed point properties @xmath36 and @xmath29 to leading order in @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath56 the luttinger liquid theory can be fermionized , which allows the full crossover function @xmath30 to be determined in that limit .    _",
    "( iii ) _ for @xmath57 the self duality argument developed in ref . allows us to compute the fixed point conductance @xmath52 exactly .",
    "these three results , along with the general scaling analysis provide an overall picture of the critical behavior of the qshi point contact as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the analysis of the pinch - off transition discussed above , we will touch on two other issues in this paper .",
    "first , we will introduce a convenient parameterization of the four terminal conductance as a @xmath58 conductance matrix . in this form symmetry constraints on the conductance",
    "are reflected in a natural way .",
    "moreover , we will predict that different components of the conductance matrix have different temperature dependence at the low temperature fixed points .",
    "in particular , we will introduce a  skew \" conductance @xmath6 , which is predicted to vanish as @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "for non interacting electrons we will show that @xmath61 , and for weak interactions @xmath62 .",
    "this behavior is a direct consequence of the spin filtered nature of the edge states , and does not occur in a generic four terminal conductance device .",
    "it is thus a powerful diagnostic for the edge states .",
    "secondly , we will examine the role of spin orbit terms at the point contact which respect time reversal symmetry but violate spin conservation .",
    "for @xmath63 we will provide evidence that such terms are _ irrelevant _ at the intermediate critical fixed point , so that they are unimportant for the critical behavior of the point contact .",
    "however , for @xmath9 , such terms are relevant .",
    "hou , kim and chamon@xcite pointed out that these terms are relevant perturbations at the charge insulator / spin conductor fixed point for @xmath9 , but they did not identify the stable phase to which the system flows at low energy .",
    "we will argue that the system flows to a time reversal symmetry breaking insulating state in which the _ four terminal _ conductance @xmath64 . since spin orbit interaction terms will generically be present in a point contact , the true low energy behavior of a point contact will be described by this phase . an interesting consequence of the broken time reversal symmetry of this phase is that the weak tunneling processes which dominate the conductance at low , but finite temperature are not electron tunneling processes . rather , they involve the tunneling of neutral spinons and spinless chargons .",
    "this has nontrivial implications for four terminal noise correlation measurements .",
    "a related effect has been predicted by maciejko et al.@xcite for the insulating state of a single impurity on a single edge of a qshi .",
    "this insulating state , however , requires stronger electron electron interactions .",
    "it occurs in the regime @xmath65 , where weak disorder already leads to anderson localization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss our model and analyze five stable phases .",
    "in addition to the simple fixed points , where charge and spin are either perfectly reflected or perfectly transmitted , we discuss the time reversal symmetry breaking insulating phase which occurs for strong interactions with spin orbit . in section iii we discuss the critical behavior of the conductance at the pinch - off transition .",
    "we will begin in section iii.a with a general discussion of the scaling theory and phase diagram , along with a summary of our results .",
    "readers who are not interested in the detailed calculations can go directly to this subsection . in the following subsections",
    "we describe the calculations for @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in detail . in section",
    "iv we conclude with a discussion of experimental and theoretical issues raised by this work . in appendix",
    "a we show describe our parameterization of the four terminal conductance and show that in this representation symmetry constraints have a simple form .",
    "in this section we will describe the luttinger liquid theory of the qshi point contact .",
    "we will begin in section ii.a by describing the luttinger liquid model first for a single edge and then relating the four edges to the theory of the sll .",
    "we then discuss the four terminal conductance . in section ii.b",
    "we describe the simple limits of our model which correspond to stable phases .",
    "the simplest limits are the perfect transmission limit , or charge conductor / spin conductor ( cc ) , the perfect reflection limit , or charge insulator / spin insulator ( ii ) .",
    "in addition we will discuss the ",
    "mixed \" phases , including the charge insulator / spin conductor ( ic ) and the charge conductor / spin insulator ( ci ) .    for most of this section",
    "we will assume that spin is conserved . while spin nonconserving spin orbit interactions are allowed and",
    "will generically be present we will argue that they are _ irrelevant _ for the fixed points and crossovers of physical interest .",
    "an exception to this , however , occurs for strong interactions when @xmath9 .",
    "this will be discussed in section ii.b.5 , where we will show that there are relevant spin orbit terms which destabilize the cc , ii and ic phases .",
    "we will argue that these perturbations flow to a different low temperature phase , which we identify as a time reversal symmetry breaking insulator ( tbi ) . in that section",
    "we will explore the transport properties of that state .",
    "much of the theory presented in this section is contained either explicitly or implicitly in the work hou , kim and chamon@xcite , as well as in refs . .",
    "we include it here to establish our notation and to make our discussion self contained .",
    "we will highlight , however , three results of this section which are original to this work .",
    "they include ( 1 ) our analysis of the four terminal conductance , which predicts that different components of the conductance matrix have different temperature dependence .",
    "in particular , we find that the skew conductance @xmath6 vanishes at low temperature as @xmath59 with @xmath8 .",
    "( 2 ) in section ii.b.5 we introduce the tbi phase discussed above .",
    "( 3 ) we introduce a perturbative analysis of the ic and ci phases in section ii.b.3 and ii.b.4 . while this was partially discussed in ref .",
    ", we will show that a full analysis requires the introduction of a pseudo - spin degree of freedom in the perturbation theory .",
    "this new pseudo - spin does not affect the lowest order stability analysis of the ic phase , but it will prove crucial for the second order renormalization group flows , which will be used in the @xmath44 expansion in section iii.d .",

    "we begin with a brief review of the qbm model and then derive its consequences for the scaling function @xmath30 and @xmath109 .",
    "the qbm model@xcite was originally formulated as a theory of the motion of a heavy particle coupled to an ohmic dissipative environment modeled as a set of caldeira leggett oscillators@xcite .",
    "though the applicability of this model to the motion of a real particle coupled to phonons or electron - hole pairs has been questioned@xcite , it was later shown that this model is directly relevant to quantum impurity problems .",
    "specifically , the qbm model in a one dimensional periodic potential is equivalent to the theory of a weak link in a single channel luttinger liquid@xcite . in this mapping",
    "the qbm takes place in an abstract space where the  coordinate \" of the  particle \" is the number of electrons that have tunneled past the weak link .",
    "the periodic potential is due to the discreteness of the electron s charge .",
    "the low energy excitations of the luttinger liquid play the role of the dissipative bath , and the strength of the dissipation is related to the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the one dimensional qbm model has two phases : a localized phase with conductance @xmath20 stable for @xmath18 and a fully coherent phase with perfect conductance stable for @xmath110 .",
    "the sll model corresponds to a qbm model in a two dimensional periodic potential , where the  coordinates \" are the spin and charge variables @xmath111 . this model is richer than its one dimensional counterpart because it admits additional fixed points which are intermediate between localized and perfect .",
    "these fixed points were first found in the luttinger liquid model@xcite , and later formulated in terms of the qbm@xcite . for certain values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 these intermediate fixed points",
    "are related to the 3 channel kondo problem@xcite and the 3 state potts models@xcite .",
    "however , those limits are not directly applicable to the qshi model , where @xmath112 .",
    "we will show that when @xmath4 the critical fixed point of the qshi point contact corresponds to the intermediate point discussed in ref . for a qbm model on a triangular lattice .    to formulate the qbm model we begin with the action ( [ scc ] ) and",

    "this fixed point can be accessed perturbatively when @xmath134 and @xmath137 are close to 1 .",
    "while this does _ not _ occur in the regime @xmath138 relevant to the qshi problem , it is instructive to study this perturbation theory because it provides evidence that the critical fixed point has emergent mirror and spin conservation symmetry .    when @xmath139 and @xmath140 the period potential has triangular symmetry , which is slightly distorted if @xmath141 .",

    "similarly , the voltages @xmath469 , which are defined up to an additive constant , define three independent voltage differences @xmath470 , with @xmath471 @xmath472 biases leads 1 and 4 relative to leads 2 and 3 , @xmath473 biases leads 1 and 2 relative to leads 3 and 4 , and @xmath474 biases leads 1 and 3 relative to leads 2 and 4 .",
    "the new currents and voltages are then related by a @xmath58 conductance matrix @xmath475 the 9 elements of @xmath428 determine the four terminal conductance matrix , @xmath476 the elements of @xmath428 have a simple physical interpretation .",

    "similarly @xmath479 is a two terminal conductance measured vertically .",
    "@xmath480 describes a two terminal conductance defined by combining the opposite leads 1 and 3 together into a single lead ( and similarly for leads 2 and 4 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is a  skew \" conductance describing the current @xmath478 in response to voltages applied to leads 1 and 2 .",
    "the other off diagonal conductances can be understood similarly .          in the presence of time reversal symmetry",
    "the four terminal conductance obeys the reciprocity relation@xcite , @xmath204 .",
    "this implies @xmath481 .",
    "thus , with time reversal symmetry the conductance has 6 independent components",
    ".      when the spin @xmath100 is conserved the current of up and down spins flowing into the junction must independently be conserved .",
    "it follows that @xmath482 since in the fermi liquid lead ( where the interactions have been turned off ) we have @xmath483 , this implies that @xmath484 it then follows that @xmath485 thus , which spin conservation the conductance is characterized by 3 components : the two terminal conductances @xmath477 , @xmath479 and the skew conductance @xmath6 .",
    "the quantization of @xmath480 and vanishing of @xmath486 are therefore a diagnostic for the conservation of spin .",

    "if the junction has a mirror symmetry under interchanging leads @xmath487 or @xmath488 , it follows that @xmath489 though mirror symmetry is not generically present in a point contact we will argue that that symmetry is restored in the low energy fixed points of interest . moreover , the _ crossover _ between the critical fixed point and the stable fixed point described by ( [ scalingform ] ) is also along a line with mirror symmetry .",

    "the kubo conductance describes the response of an _ infinite _ luttinger liquid , where the limit @xmath491 is taken _ before _",
    "this does not take into account the contact resistance between the luttinger liquid and the electron reservoir where the voltage is defined .",
    "an appropriate model to account for this is to consider a 1d model for the leads in which the luttinger parameter @xmath492 for @xmath493@xcite .    in this section",
    "we assume time reversal symmetry and that spin is conserved . in this case",
    "we may define the charge and spin currents in the fermi liquid leads ( @xmath493 ) to be , @xmath494 similarly , define charge and spin voltages @xmath495 these are related by the conductance matrix .",
