    "field theories for the number of spatial dimensions @xmath0 other than 3 have attracted a great deal of attention . for @xmath1",

    "extra dimensions are an inherent feature in string theories and in supergravity .",
    "there has been a growing interest in recent years in models formulated on backgrounds with the number of spatial dimensions @xmath2 . aside from their role as simplified models in particle physics , field theories in lower dimensions",
    "serve as effective theories describing the long - wavelength properties of a number of condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "examples for the latter are high - temperature superconductors , d - density - wave states , weyl semimetals , graphene ( and graphene related materials ) and topological insulators . for these systems ,",
    "the long - wavelength dynamics of excitations is formulated in terms of the dirac - like theory living in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime where the role of the velocity of light is played by the fermi velocity . in topological insulators ,",
    "@xmath3 massless fermionic excitations appear as edge states on the surface of a @xmath4 topological insulator .",
    "( 2 + 1)-dimensional models also appear as high temperature limits of 4-dimensional field theories .    among interesting features in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models",
    "are flavour symmetry breaking , parity violation , fractionalization of quantum numbers , the possibility of the excitations with fractional statistics .",
    "important new possibilities appear in gauge theories .",
    "in particular , the topologically gauge invariant terms in the action provide masses for the gauge fields .",
    "this leads to a natural infrared cutoff in the theory and to the solution for the infrared problem without changing the physics in the ultraviolet range @xcite . a possible mechanism for the generation of gauge invariant topological mass terms is provided by quantum corrections niem83 .",
    "the corresponding theories provide a natural framework for the investigation of the quantum hall effect . in models with fermions coupled to the chern - simons gauge field , there are states with nonzero magnetic field and with the energy lower than the lowest energy state in the absence of the magnetic field @xcite . as a consequence of this , the lorentz invariance",
    "is spontaneously broken @xcite . among the most interesting topics in the studies of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theories",
    "is the parity and chiral symmetry - breaking .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that a background magnetic field can serve as a catalyst for the dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "in addition , the background gauge fields give rise to the polarization of the ground state for quantum fields with the generation of various types of quantum numbers @xcite . in particular , charge and",
    "current densities are induced @xcite-@xcite .    in a number of field theoretical models , including the ones describing the condensed matter systems at large length scales , additional boundary conditions are imposed on the field operator .",
    "these conditions can have different physical origins .",
    "for example , in graphene nanotubes and nanoloops , because of the compactification of one or two spatial dimensions , the dirac equation is supplemented by quasiperiodicity conditions along compact dimensions with phases depending on the wrapping direction ( chirality of the nanotube ) .",
    "another type of graphene made structures in which additional boundary conditions are imposed on the field wavefunctions are graphene nanoribbons , geometrically terminated single layers of graphite ( see , for instance , @xcite )",
    ". the edge effects play a crucial role in electronic properties of nanoribbons .",
    "in particular , depending on the boundary conditions , a nonzero band gap may be generated .",
    "an important new thing is the possibility for the appearance of dispersive edge states .    among the most interesting physical consequences originating from the spatial confinement of a quantum field",
    "is the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions modify the spectrum of zero - point fluctuations and , as a consequence of that , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of physical observables are shifted .",
    "the physical quantities , most popular in the investigations of the casimir effect , are the vacuum energy and stresses . by using these quantities , the forces acting on the constraining boundaries can be evaluated .",
    "these forces are presently under active experimental investigations @xcite . for charged fields , among the most important characteristics of the ground state",
    "are the expectation values of the charge and current densities . similarly to the vacuum energy and stresses , the vevs of these quantities",
    "are influenced by the change of spatial topology or by the presence of boundaries .",
    "the vacuum currents in spaces with nontrivial topology and with quasiperiodic boundary conditions on the field operator along compact dimensions have been investigated in @xcite for the flat background geometry and in @xcite and beze15 for locally de sitter and anti - de sitter backgrounds .",
    "for the special case @xmath5 , the general results were applied to cylindrical and toroidal graphene nanotubes , within the framework of the effective dirac theory .",
    "the influence of additional boundaries on the vacuum currents along compact dimensions has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite for locally minkowski and anti - de sitter backgrounds .",
    "the combined effects of the topology , induced by a cosmic string , and coaxial boundaries on the vacuum currents have been studied in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the vevs of the fermionic charge and current densities induced by a magnetic flux in a spatial region of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime bounded by two concentric circles . on the circles ,",
    "bag boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "we assume that the flux is located inside the inner boundary and , consequently , its effect on the vacuum properties is of the aharonov - bohm type ( for the influence of the flux and boundaries on the vacuum energy see refs .",

    "mainly motivated by the graphene physics , more general conditions for the dirac equation , ensuring the absence of current normal to the boundary , have been discussed in @xcite . in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions ,",
    "the most general energy - independent boundary condition contains four parameters .    for the further consideration",

    "though the magnetic field strength for ( [ amu ] ) vanishes , the magnetic flux enclosed by the ring gives rise to aharonov - bohm - like effects on physical observables , in particular for the vevs .",
    "note that the distribution of the magnetic flux in the region @xmath46 can be arbitrary . as the boundary @xmath51 is impenetrable for the fermionic field ,",
    "the effect of the gauge field is purely topological and depends on the total flux alone . in this sense",

    "the important point here is that , owing to the flatness of the background spacetime and the zero field tensor for the external electromagnetic field in the region under consideration , for points outside the boundaries the structure of divergences is the same as for the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional boundary - free minkowski spacetime in the absence of the magnetic flux .",
    "consequently , the renormalization is reduced to the subtraction from the vevs of the corresponding minkowskian quantity . in problems of the quantum field theory with boundaries ,",
    "one of the most efficient ways to extract from the vevs the boundary - free part in a regularization independent way is based on the application of the abel - plana - type summation formulae to the corresponding mode sums ( for the applications of the abel - plana formula and its generalizations in the theory of the casimir effect see most97,saha08book ) .",

    "<S> for a massive quantum fermionic field , we investigate the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the charge and current densities induced by an external magnetic flux in a two - dimensional circular ring . </S>",
    "<S> both the irreducible representations of the clifford algebra are considered . on the ring </S>",
    "<S> edges the bag ( infinite mass ) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the radial current vanishes . the charge and the azimuthal current </S>",
    "<S> are decomposed into the boundary - free and boundary - induced contributions . </S>",
    "<S> both these contributions are odd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature that distinguishes the vevs of the charge and current densities from the vev of the energy density , is their finiteness on the ring edges . </S>",
    "<S> the current density is equal to the charge density for the outer edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge . </S>",
    "<S> the vevs are peaked near the inner edge and , as functions of the field mass , exhibit quite different features for two inequivalent representations of the clifford algebra . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , unlike the vevs in the boundary - free geometry , the vacuum charge and the current in the ring are continuous functions of the magnetic flux and vanish for half - odd integer values of the flux in units of the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> combining the results for two irreducible representations , we also investigate the induced charge and current in parity and time - reversal symmetric models . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results are applied to graphene rings with the electronic subsystem described in terms of the effective dirac theory with the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> if the energy gaps for two valleys of the graphene hexagonal lattice are the same , the charge densities corresponding to the separate valleys cancel each other , whereas the azimuthal current is doubled .    </S>",
