    "the spectral index of the blue component is consistent with a geometrically thin accretion disk , and the red component could be described by an agb star .",
    "the sed also shows excessive h@xmath2 emission which is probably originated from the accretion disk or surrounding material photo - ionized by the soft x - ray emission of m81 uls1 , but the band photometry results can not provide the width of the emission line known as an indicator of physical process .    the sed measurements , however , suffer from the intrinsic variabilities of uls1 , since a flux decrease by a factor of @xmath3 2.4 , as @xcite presented , occurred in less than a week in optical wavelength .",
    "spectral observations , on the other hand , are independent of the variabilities .",

    "three exposures of 1000 s were taken in the first night and two of 1200 s in the second night .",
    "the mean seeings in @xmath12 band were 0.6@xmath13 and 0.8@xmath13 respectively .",

    "the position of the optical counterpart along the slit was verified by comparing its position in the target acquisition image ( figure [ position]_b _ ) with an _ hst _ acs f606w image @xcite . on the red side ,",
    "since the counterpart was not obvious along the slit , an offset between the counterpart and the wd ( pg@xmath15 ) was used to verify the position of the counterpart .",
    "subsequently , raw spectra of the counterpart were extracted with an aperture size of 1 .",
    "the wavelength calibration was then carried out based on the line lists given in the manual of keck .",

    "h@xmath21 absorption features are detected in a specific region along the slit as illustrated in figure [ position]_c_. the regions with absorption features are located in the same area of the sky but different parts of the ccd in two nights observations , so these absorption features are unlikely artifacts of the ccd .",
    "the same features were also found near h@xmath26 , but the signal is too low to derive reliable velocity .    in order to investigate the association between the balmer absorption lines and the environment of m81 uls1 , false - color maps were constructed in optical ( _ hst _ ) , uv ( _ galex _ ) and ir ( _ spitzer _ ) wavelengths .",
    "only the map of _ spitzer _ exhibits obvious structures along the slit ( figure  [ position]_a _ ) .",
    "the region with the absorption features is correlated with the dark area in the map of 8  @xmath17 m , and the absorption features disappear when the 8  @xmath17 m emission is strong .",
    "note that there is a positive correlation between 8  @xmath17 m surface brightness and h@xmath2 emission powered by star forming activity @xcite .",
    "the observed absorption features appear in the non - star - forming regions , and likely come from the local stellar environments in the m81 bulge .",

    "the systemic velocity of m81 is @xmath3534 ( obtained from ned ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission line ( @xmath36 ) exhibits a receding velocity of 178 @xmath1 35 relative to the h@xmath21 absorption line from the stellar environment .",
    "this suggests that uls1 is not a system comoving with stars in the bulge of m81 .",
    "such a relative velocity can come from an object in the halo of m81 projected onto its bulge , which is receding along the line of sight . here",
    "we rule out the possibility that the system is located in the milky way , since the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms at the location of uls1 is 5.4 @xmath1 0.5 @xmath37 10@xmath38 @xmath23 in the milky way @xcite , smaller than that derived from the x - ray spectrum fitting by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "the spectral observations of m81 uls1 enable us to obtain sed uncontaminated by its intrinsic variabilities .",
    "here we removed all the emission lines and used a power - law function , @xmath39 , to fit the continuum of @xmath3 4500@xmath356000  , the high response wavelength range , in order to estimate the spectral index on the blue side .",

    "the combined sed is not consistent with the red - side spectrum , which suggests that the agb model may be not a good explanation of the red component .    as a connection of x - ray and optical wavebands ,",
    "the uv emission is important to understand the sed of m81 uls1 . in order to probe the uv emission of m81 uls1",
    ", we used the archive data of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; @xcite ) .",

    "the photometric results are listed in table  [ result ] and also shown in figure [ sed ] .",
    "although with dispersions , the uv fluxes are lying along the mcd powerlaw .",
    "in this letter we report the first optical spectroscopic confirmation of an accretion disk around a uls .",
    "the broad balmer emission lines of m81 uls1 revealed by the keck / lris observations are consistent with from an accretion disk around a compact object .",
    "the spectral index of the continuum on the blue side is also consistent with the @xmath43 relation expected by mcd model .",
    "the velocity of the h@xmath2 emission line relative to its local stellar environments suggests that m81 uls1 is possibly a halo system in m81 belonging to an old population .",
    "careful analysis shows no significant shift of h@xmath2 emission line with a span of 4 days .",
    "this might suggest a small inclination angle or a small velocity of the compact object .",
    "the latter can come from a long orbital period , or a very massive compact object such as an imbh .",
    "however , the exact nature of the compact object is still unknown without monitoring of the long - term motion of the system .    besides emission lines of balmer series ,",
    "an emission line arises around 5530  on the blue side with an fwhm of 1700 @xmath1 200 , larger than that of h@xmath2 by a factor of 4 ( the lower panel in figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "all exposures obtained in two nights show the same emission feature and similar velocity dispersions , so it is unlikely an artifact or cosmic rays .",
    "this emission line is too broad to be a nebular line , and it is probably not an fe ii emission line because fe@xmath46 ion emits through a huge number of multiplets scattered across the blue side of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "since the relative shift is 10  @xmath1 2  between two nights observations , the emission line is unlikely related to the accretion disk .",
    "it is reported that n ii @xmath335530 and @xmath335535 emission lines have been detected for ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "however , no other features are found to support the existence of an ae / be star , such as fe ii or o i emission lines .",
    "more spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio are needed to draw a conclusive result .",
    "the spectrum of m81 uls1 shows a gap between the red and blue sides due to the low response on the edges of ccds , and signal - to - noise ratio on the red side is very low .",
    "further deeper spectroscopic observations with the coverage of @xmath3 5000@xmath359000  could present the complete spectrum with high signal - to - noise ratio on the red side , which will enable us to characterize the secondary .    the authors thank prof .",
