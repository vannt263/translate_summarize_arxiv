    "in particular , periodic longitudinal modulation of the coupling strength results in soliton oscillations and decay  @xcite , harmonic longitudinal modulation of the linear refractive index leads to parametric amplification of transverse soliton swinging  @xcite , while longitudinal modulation of the nonlinearity can be used to steer solitons  @xcite .",
    "nowadays the technique in fabricating a desired optical lattice is mature .",
    "even the three - dimensional optical lattice has been created with the optical induction technique  @xcite .",
    "properties of solitons supported by media with local nonlinear response are now well established . however",
    ", under appropriate conditions , the nonlinear response of materials can be highly nonlocal , a phenomenon that importantly affects the properties of solitons supported by such media  @xcite .",

    "the reason is that the peierls - nabarro potential barrier for solitons moving across the lattice is drastically reduced in the presence of nonlocality , which results in an obvious reduction of the radiation losses of solitons traveling across the lattices  @xcite . since the nonlocality makes the radiative trapping less likely to happen , an increase of the nonlocality degree leads to an enhancement of the soliton mobility , as shown in fig .",
