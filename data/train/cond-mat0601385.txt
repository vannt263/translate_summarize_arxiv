    "pressure and magnetic field have been used as external parameters to drive heavy fermion materials through different quantum critical points review .",
    "the theory of the heavy fermion quantum criticality has been developed starting on the paramagnetic side of their phase diagram mucio . in the ordered magnetic phase , usually with antiferromagnetic ( af ) long range order ,",
    "most studies have concentrated in determining the shape of the critical line as a function of pressure ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) , in particular when @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this gives information on the important _ shift _ exponent which is determined by the critical exponents associated with the qcp .",
    "however , in the broken symmetry phase , the magnetic excitations are spin - waves and a relevant question concerns what happens to these modes as the quantum critical point ( qcp ) is approached from the ordered side @xcite . more specifically , we ask what happens to the spin - wave parameters , its gap and stiffness as , for example , @xmath3 goes to zero , i.e. , @xmath0 approaches @xmath4 the critical pressure ?",
    "the most direct way to answer this question would be to perform neutron scattering experiments , but these are non trivial .",
    "there are other less direct strategies to follow these modes as the system approaches a qcp .",
    "one of these is the electrical resistivity .",
    "since magnons scatter the conduction electrons of the correlated metal , the temperature dependent resistivity has a component which is due to electron - magnon scattering .",
    "the temperature dependence of this component yields direct information on the spin - wave gap and stiffness @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been many experimental studies on field induced transitions in magnetic heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these experiments takes into account correlated electrons with masses strongly renormalized by the presence of a qcp at the critical field @xmath5 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , field induced magnetic transitions are associated with soft spin - wave modes . consequently , close to @xmath5 these modes give an important contribution to the thermodynamic properties and electrical resistivity , by scattering the quasi - particles .",
    "these contributions should be included in an analysis of this phase transition , besides that of other quasi - particles .",
    "the magnetic field and temperature dependent phase diagram of an anisotropic antiferromagnet , with the external field @xmath1 applied in the easy axis direction @xcite , is shown schematically in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "general features of this phase diagram are the presence of a tricritical point and lines of first and second order transitions .",
    "heavy fermions are in general strongly anisotropic and a relevant situation for these materials is the _",
    "metamagnetic case _ where there is no intermediate spin - flop phase at all and the system goes directly from the antiferromagnetic phase to the paramagnetic phase through a line of second order phase transitions , @xmath6 .",
    "we start considering the case relevant for the study of heavy fermions systems , _ driven by pressure _ to a qcp .",
    "the spectrum of hydrodynamic spin - wave excitations in the antiferromagnetic phase , for @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , is given by , @xmath9where the gap @xmath10 is proportional to the anisotropy ( either exchange or single ion ) . in the isotropic case and in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the hydrodynamic magnons have a linear dispersion relation , @xmath11 , differently from those in a ferromagnet , for which , @xmath12 .",
    "we consider first a metallic antiferromagnet in a simple cubic lattice with no applied external field . following yamada and takada @xcite we write the electrical resistivity due to electron - magnon scattering as , @xmath13where",

    "the function @xmath21 is such that , @xmath22 and @xmath23.the last condition implies @xmath24 , or @xmath25 .",

    "[ antiferrogap ] allows to obtain from the measured @xmath35 , the absolute value of the spin - wave gap . if @xmath35 is measured for different pressures it yields the trend of the stiffness @xmath36 and gap @xmath10 as a function of this parameter , for example , when approaching a qcp . in a recent analysis of a magnetic heavy fermion driven to a qcp by pressure",
    ", we obtained that @xmath37 , vanishing with pressure at the same critical pressure @xmath4 that @xmath38 vanishes while the stiffness @xmath36 remains unrenormalized @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to confirm these results by direct neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the next topic of this report which deals with the phase transition induced in @xmath39 heavy fermions by an _ external magnetic field_. in this case it is useful to start in the paramagnetic phase , with @xmath40 ( see fig .",

    "the minimum of the spin - wave spectrum occurs for @xmath44 . for simplicity",
    "we have considered only the isotropic part of the exchange coupling @xcite . since @xmath45 , the condition @xmath46 defines the critical field @xmath47 , below which the spin - wave energy becomes negative signalling the entrance of the system in the @xmath39 or spin - flop phase . above",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath6 is determined by that of the spin - wave stiffness @xmath55 keffer , callen .",
    "this generally results in a critical line varying with temperature as , @xmath56 .    we can obtain the magnon contribution to the electrical resistivity in the presence of the external magnetic field as , @xmath57 , where in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite , @xmath58with @xmath20 .",

    "ii , for @xmath62 and in particular for @xmath63 , the dominant contribution to the resistivity is due to gapless magnons and given by , @xmath64 . in this region , for a fixed temperature @xmath62 , the resistivity as a function of magnetic field obtained from eq.[ferro ] is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the resistivity has a cusp at @xmath5 .",
    "in fact @xmath65 and diverges to @xmath66 as @xmath67 @xcite .    in region",
    "i , for @xmath68 the resistivity is calculated as in the previous section and is given by , @xmath69    , which diverges as a power law when @xmath1 approaches @xmath5 . ]",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system close to @xmath5 can be easily obtained in the soft mode scenario .",
    "they are essentially those of a system of non - interacting bosons .",
    "the temperature and field dependent contribution of the spin - wave excitations to the specific heat @xmath70 can be shown to have a form similar to that of the electrical resistivity .",
    "we get , @xmath71 @xmath72 , with @xmath72 given in eq.[ferro ] . consequently , in region ii , which includes the line @xmath73 , the specific heat has a simple power law dependence , @xmath74 . in region",
    "i , the field and temperature dependence of @xmath70 is the same as that of the resistivity given in eq .",
    "[ ferrogap ] .",
    "the magnetization at the critical field @xmath5 decreases with a @xmath75 power law . in region",
    "i for @xmath76 it decreases exponentially due to the gap , @xmath77 .",
    "many heavy fermions systems due to their anisotropy in the crystalline structure have a regime close to their qcp where the critical fluctuations have a two - dimensional character @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to generalize the results obtained above for the case of two dimensions ( 2d ) . in @xmath78",
    "the relevant integral for the resistivity can be evaluated and we get , @xmath79where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the limit @xmath82 , this reduces to @xmath83this resistivity varies nearly linear in temperature ( fig.[fig3 ] ) but for @xmath67 ( @xmath84 ) it is not defined for finite temperatures .",
    "this is related to the fact that for an isotropic system there is no long range order in two dimensions at any finite temperature due to the creation of an infinite number of magnons .",
    "the systems we are considering are in fact three dimensional , although they may exhibit in some region of their phase diagram a @xmath78 behavior .",
    "however , this is just a regime which will cross over to @xmath85 sufficiently close to the transition .",
    "consequently this divergence of @xmath86 should not interfere with the actual observation of a nearly linear temperature dependence of the resistivity of real systems in some range of region ii . in @xmath78",
    "the spin - wave contribution to the specific heat , as before , has a similar field and temperature dependence of the resistivity due to electron - magnon scattering .",
    "we find in this case ( @xmath82 ) that in region ii ( fig.[fig3 ] ) , @xmath87    the decrease of the magnetization with temperature in a fixed field in this region also has a field and temperature dependence similar to eq .",
    "[ r2d ] .     and specific heat @xmath88 divided by t in 2d .",

    "[ ferrogap ] .",
    "only the temperature dependence of the pre - factor is dependent on dimensionality .",
    "this makes it difficult to distinguish a @xmath78 from a @xmath85 regime in this region , either in thermodynamic or transport measurements .",
    "we have obtained the electrical and thermodynamic properties of a metallic antiferromagnetic system due to spin - wave modes close to a zero temperature field induced transition .",
    "the existence of these excitations close to this phase transition is a general phenomenon , depending only on the appearance of a symmetry - broken state below @xmath5 .",
    "the resistivity is determined by the scattering of quasi - particles by ferromagnetic - like magnons which become gapless at the transition .",
    "the contribution of the spin - wave modes to the thermodynamic and transport properties is distinct in different regions of the phase diagram . in region",
    "i , this is exponentially suppressed by the gap @xmath77 , but in region ii these modes are effectively gapless and give rise to important contributions .",
    "notice that these contributions should be considered _ in addition to those of other quasi - particles .",
    "_ for example , in region i , it has been observed @xcite a significant @xmath90 term in the resistivity probably due to electron - electron interaction .",
    "this temperature dependence of the resistivity is different from that arising from spin - wave scattering which in turn is exponentially suppressed by the gap . in region",
    "ii however , the spin - wave term is large and its power law temperature dependence is similar to that associated with non - fermi liquid behavior close to a qcp @xcite .",
    "this will make it difficult to separate this contribution from that of other quasi - particles .",
    "the interaction of the latter with the spin - wave modes may even give rise to substantial mass renormalization .",
    "the same remarks apply for the thermodynamic properties in both regions .",
    "the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic properties at the critical field @xmath91 is similar to that predicted by the scaling theory of a qcp with a dynamic exponent @xmath92 @xcite . in the present case , this value of @xmath93 reflects the ferromagnetic - like dispersion of the magnons and not the antiferromagnetic nature of the transition .",
    "in the extreme metamagnetic case of an ising antiferromagnet in an external longitudinal field , a renormalization group approach yields a phase diagram where the @xmath94 transition at @xmath5 is not associated with a fixed point .",
    "the point ( @xmath95 ) is just an ordinary point that flows to ( @xmath96 ) as any point in the line of second order transitions @xmath97 , since the magnetic field turns out to be an _ irrelevant _",
    "parameter @xcite .",
    "notice that the spin - wave approach presented above is independent whether the @xmath52 transition at @xmath5 is associated or not with a fixed point .",
