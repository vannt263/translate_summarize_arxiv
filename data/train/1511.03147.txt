    "electromagnetic radiation is produced from multiple sources in heavy ion collisions .",
    "of particular interest is the radiation produced during the deconfined phase by the scattering and annihilation of quarks .",
    "this thermal radiation is not that of a blackbody yet nevertheless provides a reasonable measurement of the temperature reached in these collisions @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow of the radiated photons gives some measure of when these photons were created : the elliptic flow during the plasma phase starts small and then builds up to the measured values , and the photons produced at the various times have flow similar to that of the matter from which they were radiated .",
    "the first predictions of thermal photon production had relatively small elliptic flow , thanks to a large component of the photons coming from the earliest times in the collision .",
    "however , measurements by the phenix collaboration at the relativistic heavy ion collider show @xmath2 of photons approaching that of hadrons @xcite , which suggests underestimation of photons emitted later in the reaction .",
    "phenix s observed yield of direct photons is also larger than what was first predicted using thermal rates of production @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable work both in examining thermal photon rates and of viscous corrections has quantified both the strong agreement between theory and experiment for much of the momentum range for photon production , while showing exactly where novel mechanisms for photon production might be at play @xcite .",
    "possible explanations for the large elliptic flow include initial flow , incomplete thermalization in the quark sector at early times , and the enhancement of quark degrees of freedom in the polyakov nambu - jona - lasinio and the `` semi - qgp '' models @xcite . in this paper , we consider a neglected source of photons sure to exist : the production of photons at the point of recombination of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "this source is analogous to the recombination spectra studied in plasma physics and in cosmology , but it is also similar the the `` fragmentation photons '' produced in event generators such as pythia as quarks evolve from large to small @xmath3 .",
    "the production of photons at the point of hadronization was also considered by campbell @xcite ; this current work differs from campbell s in that we are primarily interested in how the electromagnetically charged quarks and anti - quarks radiate as they hadronize , as opposed to how gluonic degrees of freedom might create light as they disappear .",
    "figure [ fig : curly ] illustrates three contributions to direct photon production from deconfined quarks .",
    "emission occurs as unbound quark states are jostled in the medium , as is well known . but",
    "a significant jerk occurs when the quarks begin to form bound states , leading to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "finally , some of these bound states are initially excited , and must undergo transitions ( sometimes electromagnetic ) to ground states .",
    "this cartoon emphasizes how large the acceleration of quarks is at the end of the heavy ion collision , but work in quantifying this is necessary .",
    "( color online ) an illustration of different sources of photons .",
    "emission from the plasma stage ( a ) is induced by collisions and annihilations of quarks . in ( b ) , the transition to a bound state is electromagnetic , leading to photon emission .",
    "if loose color singlets are first formed , photons are also emitted during the spontaneous emission of excited states ( c).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    figure [ fig : phenix ] displays the direct photon spectra as measured by phenix @xcite along with the ratio of the direct photon spectra to that of positive pions @xcite . if a contribution to the photons is to explain the large elliptic flow , it must come after the first few @xmath4 of the collision so that elliptic flow will have built up , and to explain the measured spectra the contribution must be of the order of 2% of the final number of final - state pions . by considering emission related to hadronization , which should occur for times @xmath5 fm/@xmath6 into the collision , the first criterion is met . for the remainder of this paper , we will focus on seeing whether contributions from emission at hadronization could have sufficient strength to give a ratio of the yields of direct photons to @xmath7 of roughly 2% .",
    "the unifying theme of this current work is that the transition from unbound to bound states and ultimately to ground states represents a significant acceleration of electrically charged particles and therefore an important source of electromagnetic radiation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this paper is broken up as follows : in section [ sec : quark - meson ] we use the quark - meson model at leading order to describe electromagnetic radiation from quarks coalescing directly into pions .",
    "this model is similar to polyakov loop - inspired models in that the gluonic degrees of freedom are suppressed .",
    "the diagram of interest involves an incoming quark - antiquark pair evolving into a final - state pion and a photon , @xmath8 .",
    "because the outgoing state has only two particles , the photon can carry approximately half the center of mass energy which suggests the process might be a good candidate for photons in the gev range . in section [ sec : l>0 ]",
    "we examine whether the transition to hadrons might lead to yields of excited states beyond the thermal expectation values , using a simple scalar potential model to confine the quarks into bound states and two different models for how this transition might occur .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : em ] , we calculate the electromagnetic transitions in these models , to determine rates for photon production both from a thermal gas of bound quarks as well as a gas with elevated populations of excited states . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the main points of the paper as well as suggest where a great deal of future work is necessary .",
    "in the quark - meson model ( which ultimately evolved from descriptions of meson - nucleon couplings in @xcite ) , both quarks and mesons are treated as fundamental point - like degrees of freedom , and gluonic degrees of freedom are ignored .",
    "the lagrangian , without the electromagnetic coupling , is of the form @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the potential which remains after spontaneously breaking the original symmetry in the mesonic sector and explicit chiral symmetry breaking gives masses @xmath11 to the goldstone bosons of the mesonic sector s symmetry breaking . for our purposes , @xmath10 is ignored : we will be concerned with tree - level diagrams where quarks and anti - quarks annihilate into color - neutral particles .",
    "when plasmas of quarks at temperatures near 180 mev cool , they eventually must combine to form the color singlets observed at low temperatures .",
    "the quark - meson model can describe this process at these high but not asymptotically high temperatures , because one needs to be in the transition range where both hadrons and quarks coexist . for simplicity , we consider only those diagrams where the outgoing hadrons are pions .",
    "later , we will discuss how rates might grow if additional hadronic states are included .",
    "additionally , we consider only @xmath12 diagrams .",
    "the neglected @xmath13 processess produce lower energy photons , and should not contribute as significantly to the @xmath14 gev direct photons measured experimentally .    at tree level",
    "this leaves only 5 leading - order channels where the outgoing states are pions or photons : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . at the point of hadronization , there exist two processes of the ones above which lead to the production of photons .",
    "if these were the only two processes , then our work would be finished : we would only have to count the numbers of quarks to determine the number of photons produced . however , there are two competing ( indeed , significantly more frequent ) processes above which lead only to the production of pions .    this situation is encountered frequently in atomic physics , where excited states de - excitate radiatively at a rate @xmath20 as well as de - excitate collisionally at a rate @xmath21 .",
    "the _ quantum efficiency _",
    "@xmath22 gives the fraction of states which de - excitate radiatively ; equivalently , if there are @xmath23 excited atomic states in a given gas , and these excited states only decay once , then there are @xmath24 photons radiated once all excited states decay .",
    "we are interested in the same quantity , the quantum efficiency of photon production at hadronization .",
    "the first step in calculating this efficiency is to determine the matrix elements for photon production at hadronization .",
    "first , we consider @xmath25 : the quarks are coupled to the mesons through the @xmath26 in the quark - meson model .",

    "however , when starting work on a given problem , consideration of the extreme limits is helpful and occasionally , all that is needed .    in the main narrative of this paper , we considered hadronization to be an adiabatic process : the potential changes from negligible to confining slowly enough so that the _ quantum numbers _ of the various quark states are conserved .",

    "this approximation is very useful : one simply takes the wavefunction right before the potential turns on , determines the expression for this wavefunction in terms of the _ new _ eigenfunctions of the system once the potential has turned on , and one now knows the dynamics of the system into the future . in relativistic field theories ,",
    "the situation is richer physically , as we will now demonstrate .",

    "meanwhile , massless quarks above deconfinement have , in the dirac representation of the gamma matrices , the normalized solution for a left - handed particle ( not antiparticle ) moving freely in the z - direction : @xmath136    if the potentials suddenly change from zero to the coulombic and confining potential terms described above , one encounters a problem common when working with quantum fields in curved spacetime : it becomes impossible to choose a vacuum which is `` empty '' both when the potential is zero and when it is the confining cornell potential .",
    "what was the vacuum state for free massless dirac particles is now is an excited state with particles and antiparticles described by the @xmath137 and @xmath138 wavefunctions . very abstractly , where the subscript `` 1 '' indicates the free theory and the subscript `` 2 '' the confined theory , the expectation for the number of particles of type `` 2 '' after the vacuum of type `` 1 '' is subjected to the confining potential is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the bogoliubov coefficients , the index @xmath66 represents labels for both momentum and spin and the index @xmath142 represents the quantum numbers of the @xmath61 and @xmath63 states , and where no sum over @xmath142 is represented by the repeated index .",
    "when the initial state is not the vacuum but instead contains a free dirac particle , the expectation for the number of particles becomes @xmath143    in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( where there is no particle production by potentials breaking poincare symmetry ) , the quantity @xmath144 would simply be the probability that a plane wave would be measured in the energy eigenstate described by the @xmath145 wavefunctions : @xmath146 more explicitly , for the @xmath61 states , @xmath147 \\bigg|^2 { \\rm . }",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the @xmath148-direction was chosen to coincide with the plane wave s momentum @xmath50 .",
    "this probability should then be convolved with the thermal distribution of quarks at @xmath84 and summed over @xmath67 states : @xmath149      in fig . [",
    "fig : overlap ] , the ratio of the thermal average of the probability of a massless quark with momentum @xmath150 to the probability of being found the in the @xmath151 lowest a state is compared with the ratio of the boltzmann factor at @xmath152 to the boltzmann factor of this ground state .",
    "comparing these ratios , instead of just comparing the quantum - mechanical and thermal probabilities , spares us from having to calculate the partition function for a particle in these potentials .",
    "the ratios by definition agree for the ground state , while the @xmath153 states show significant enhancement above the thermal value .",
