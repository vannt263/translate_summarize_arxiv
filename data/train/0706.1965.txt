    "the apparently low resolved binary fraction of field brown dwarfs ( @xmath21015% ; see @xcite and references therein ) has been cited as evidence of mass - dependent multiple formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as predicted by some brown dwarf formation models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , resolved imaging studies provide only a lower limit to the true binary fraction , and evidence from radial velocity studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and overluminous cluster members @xcite suggests a much higher total binary fraction , perhaps 25% or more @xcite .",
    "this may prove to be a significant challenge for some brown dwarf formation theories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unresolved multiples also play an important role in understanding the transition between the two lowest - luminosity classes of known brown dwarfs , the l dwarfs and t dwarfs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "while condensate cloud models provide a physical basis for this transition @xcite , they fail to explain its apparent rapidity , as deduced by the small effective temperature ( t@xmath3 ) differential @xcite and apparent brightening at 1  @xmath1 @xcite between late - type l dwarfs and mid - type t dwarfs .",
    "multiplicity effects may be partly responsible for these trends , particularly as the resolved binary fraction of l / t transition objects is nearly twice that of other spectral types @xcite , and can result in overestimated temperatures and surface fluxes @xcite . as the total binary fraction of l / t transition objects may be higher still ( perhaps as high as 65% ; @xcite ) , interpretations of absolute brightness , color and t@xmath3 trends across this important evolutionary phase for nearly all brown dwarfs may be skewed .",

    "the multiple spectral observations were then median - combined after scaling individual spectra to match the highest signal - to - noise observation .",
    "telluric and instrumental response corrections for the science data were determined using the method outlined in @xcite , with line shape kernels derived from the arc lines .",
    "adjustments were made to the telluric spectra to compensate for differing line strengths in the observed a0  v spectrum and pseudo - velocity shifts .",
    "final calibration was made by multiplying the spectrum of sdss  j0805 + 4812 by the telluric correction spectrum , which includes instrumental response correction through the ratio of the observed a0  v spectrum to a scaled , shifted and deconvolved kurucz model spectrum of vega .",
    "the reduced spectrum of sdss  j0805 + 4812 is shown in figure  [ fig_nirspec ] , and compared to equivalent spex prism data for the optically classified l4 2mass  j11040127 + 1959217 ( * ? ? ?",

    "these properties can be explained by the presence of thinner photospheric condensate clouds @xcite , which enhances the relative opacity of atomic and molecular species around 1  @xmath1 and produces bluer @xmath5 and mid - infrared colors @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have found that the thin cloud interpretation fails to explain the unusually blue @xmath17 colors of sdss  j0805 + 4812 , nor does it explain the presence of ch@xmath0 absorption at 1.6  @xmath1 but not at 2.2  @xmath1 .",

    "subsequent high resolution imaging has resolved this source into two point source components and apparently confirm this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the similarity in the spectral peculiarities between 2mass  j0518 - 2828 and sdss  j0805 + 4812 suggests that the latter may be a similar but as yet unrecognized pair .",
    "to explore the binary hypothesis for sdss  j0805 + 4812 , the technique of binary spectral template matching was employed .",

    "the individual spectra were flux - calibrated using the @xmath18/spectral type relation of @xcite , based on published optical and near - infrared spectral types for l dwarfs and t dwarfs , respectively , and synthetic mko magnitudes determined directly from the spectra .",

    "the best match binary template for sdss  j0805 + 4812 is shown in figure  [ fig_double ] , composed of the l5 2mass  j15074769 - 1627386 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the combined spectrum is an excellent match to that of sdss  j0805 + 4812 ( @xmath22 = 0.10 ) , reproducing the latter s blue spectral energy distribution , enhanced 1.15 and 1.3  @xmath1 h@xmath14o absorption bands , weak 2.3  @xmath1 co absorption , and most notably the presence of weak ch@xmath0 absorption at 1.6  @xmath1 .",
    "several combinations of mid - type l dwarf and mid - type t dwarf components produced similar excellent fits ; in contrast , the single spectral templates were all poor matches ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "a mean of all binary spectral templates with @xmath24 ( 33 pairs ) weighted by their inverse deviations yielded mean component types of l4.6@xmath40.7 and t4.9@xmath40.6 .",
    "the inferred primary type is notably consistent with the optical classification of sdss  j0805 + 4812 .",
    "this is an encouraging result , since l dwarfs are significantly brighter than t dwarfs at optical wavelengths and should thus dominate the combined light flux .",
    "the inferred secondary spectral type is significantly later , explaining both the presence ( strong absorption ) and weakness ( lower relative flux ) of the ch@xmath0 feature at 1.6  @xmath1 in the composite spectrum of sdss  j0805 + 4812 .",
    "spectral types of l4.5 and t5 are hereafter adopted for the binary components of this system .",
    "based on the excellent match of the spectrum of sdss  j0805 + 4812 to empirical binary templates composed of normal , single sources , it is compelling to conclude that unresolved binarity provides the simplest explanation for the peculiarities of this source . assuming this to be the case , it is possible to characterize the components of sdss  j0805 + 4812 in some detail .",
    "component @xmath25 magnitudes on the mko system were determined from reported photometry of the source @xcite and integrating mko filter profiles over the flux calibrated binary template spectra .",
    "best values , again using a weighted mean for all matches with @xmath24 , are listed in table  [ tab_component ] .",
    "comparison of the component magnitudes to absolute magnitude / spectral type relations from @xcite yields distance estimates of 14.5@xmath42.1  pc and 14.8@xmath42.5  pc for the primary and secondary , respectively , where the uncertainties of the spectral types of the components and photometric magnitudes are explicitly included .",
    "it is of no surprise that these distance estimates are consistent , since the binary templates from which the component types are inferred are flux calibrated using the same absolute magnitude scales .",
    "a mean distance of 14.6@xmath42.2  pc is estimated for this system .",
    "the secondary is considerably fainter than the primary , particularly at @xmath15-band , where @xmath26 = 3.03@xmath40.16 is deduced .",
    "this suggests a low system mass ratio ( @xmath27 m@xmath14/m@xmath28 ) . using the relative @xmath15-band flux , @xmath15-band bolometric corrections from @xcite , and assuming @xmath29 @xcite ,",
    "@xmath30 = 0.48 is inferred .",
    "this value is indeed smaller than the mass ratios of most very low - mass binaries , 77% of which have @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , the approximation used here assumes that both components are brown dwarfs .",
    "the primary is of sufficiently early type that it may be an older hydrogen burning low - mass star or massive brown dwarf . using the evolutionary models of @xcite and assuming component luminosities calculated from the @xmath32/spectral type relation of @xcite , estimated component masses and t@xmath3s for ages of 1 and 5  gyr were computed and are listed in table  [ tab_component ] .",
    "if sdss  j0805 + 4812 is an older system , the mass ratio of the system increases toward unity .",
    "this is because the slightly less massive substellar secondary has had a much longer time to cool to t dwarf temperatures , while the primary has settled onto the main sequence .",
    "the strong age dependence on mass ratio estimates for low - mass stellar / substellar binaries is an important bias that is frequently overlooked .      from the previous discussion",
    ", it is clear that a robust characterization of the sdss  j0805 + 4812 components requires an age determination for the system , which is generally difficult for individual field sources .",
    "age constraints may be feasible in this case , however , as the inferred luminosities of its components straddle the depletion line @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig_evol ] .",
    "the so - called `` binary lithium test '' pointed out by @xcite states that if lithium is present in the atmosphere of both components of the system , a maximum age may be inferred .",
    "conversely , if lithium is absent , a minimum age may be inferred .",
    "the most interesting case is the absence of lithium in the primary spectrum but its presence in the secondary spectrum , which restricts the age of the system to a finite range .",
    "the presence of lithium in the primary may be inferred from the 6708   line in the system s composite spectrum .",
    "optical data from @xcite show no obvious feature at this wavelength , indicating lithium depletion in the primary and a minimum age of 0.8  gyr for the system based on the evolutionary models of @xcite and the estimated component luminosities .",
    "however , the optical data for this faint source may have insufficient signal - to - noise , and the absence of the line requires confirmation . for the secondary , the 6708   line",
    "is not expected to be seen even if this component is substellar , as atomic li is expected to be depleted to licl below temperatures of @xmath21500  k @xcite . in this case",
    "the presence of lithium requires detection of the weak 15  @xmath1 band of licl , which has yet to be detected in any t dwarf . nevertheless ,",
    "if licl could be detected in the spectrum of this component , the system s age could be constrained to 15  gyr .",
    "future observational work , perhaps with the james webb space telescope , may eventually provide the necessary observations to make this age determination .",
    "as the inferred components of sdss  j0805 + 4812 appear to widely straddle the l / t transition , their relative magnitudes provide a good test of absolute magnitude / spectral type relations across this transition .",
    "figure  [ fig_absmag ] displays @xmath33 and @xmath18 magnitudes for 28 l and t dwarfs with accurate parallax measurement ( @xmath34  mag ) and the eight components of the binaries kelu  1ab @xcite , @xmath35 indi bab @xcite , sdssp j042348.57 - 041403.5ab ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the absolute magnitudes of the secondary were then computed using the relative magnitudes listed in table  [ tab_component ] . in both bands , there is excellent agreement between the secondary magnitudes and the absolute magnitude / spectral type relations shown .",
    "this is not surprising at @xmath15-band , since the spectral templates used in the binary analysis were all flux - calibrated according to this relation .",
    "however , the agreement at @xmath9-band is encouraging , particularly as the derived @xmath33 for sdss  j0805 + 4812b , 14.7@xmath40.3 , is also consistent with absolute magnitudes for other t5-t5.5 sources .",

    "* m.  liu , 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "the estimated spectral types and photometric properties of the sdss  j0805 + 4812 components are unique in that they straddle the l / t transition more widely than other l dwarf / t dwarf binaries identified to date .",
    "however , it is important to remember that these parameters are predictions based on the binary spectral template analysis .",
    "resolved photometry , radial velocity monitoring and/or parallax measurements would provide unambiguous confirmation of these results .",
    "in this article , it has been demonstrated that the peculiar spectrum of the l4/l9.5 sdss  j0805 + 4812 can be sufficiently explained as the combined light spectrum of an l4.5 plus t5 unresolved binary .",
    "this source joins a growing list of l / t transition binaries , many of which exhibit the same spectral peculiarities as sdss  j0805 + 4812 ( blue near - infrared colors , presence of 1.6  @xmath1 ch@xmath0 absorption without the 2.2  @xmath1 band ) and have been subsequently resolved through high resolution imaging @xcite .",
    "the similarity in the spectral peculiarities of these sources suggests that other binaries composed of l and t dwarf components could be readily identified and characterized through analysis of low - resolution , combined - light , near - infrared spectroscopy alone , as has been demonstrated here .",
    "this is a promising prospect , as traditional high resolution imaging or spectroscopic techniques are limited by resolution and geometry restrictions , such that closely - separated binaries and/or distant binary systems can be overlooked .",
    "this is particularly a concern for brown dwarf binaries , over 80% of which have projected separations less than 20  au @xcite .",
    "the use of combined light spectra in binary studies are not subject to resolution limitations , enabling the identification of binaries independent of separation .",
    "furthermore , low resolution near - infrared spectroscopy is far less resource intensive than high resolution imaging and spectroscopic techniques , which requirie the use of large telescopes and/or space - based platforms .    on the other hand ,",
    "spectral peculiarities arising from binaries will arise only over a limited range of mass ratios ( e.g. , they will not generally be seen in equal - mass systems ) , may be readily apparent only in systems composed of l dwarf plus t dwarf components , and must be distinguished from spectral peculiarities arising from other effects such as metallicity , surface gravity or condensate cloud structure .",
    "hence , the phase space in which unresolved binaries may be identified via low - resolution spectroscopy may be restricted in a non - trivial way , and its characterization is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented here should make it clear that low - resolution near - infrared spectroscopic analysis provides a complementary approach to traditional high resolution imaging and spectroscopic techniques in the identification and characterization of low - mass stellar and substellar binaries .",
