    "<S> i summarize recent developments in spectrum calculations using kogut - susskind quarks . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical developments include one - loop computations with improved actions . </S>",
    "<S> i present some recent simulation results , mostly from a milc collaboration project using three flavors . </S>",
    "<S> effects of dynamical quarks are clearly seen in the isovector @xmath0 meson propagator and in the mass ratio `` j '' .    </S>",
    "<S> the kogut - susskind formulation of lattice fermions , often called `` staggered fermions '' , has long been a popular formulation for qcd simulations including dynamical quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the basic reason for this is the single remaining exact chiral symmetry , which is sufficient to protect the quark mass from additive renormalization . from a practical viewpoint , </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence is a lower limit on the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , which insures that the simulation will be well behaved and not encounter `` exceptional configurations . '' also , but less importantly , there are simply fewer fermionic degrees of freedom to handle . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effect of these advantages is that we can use our limited computer power to push to smaller dynamical quark masses , or larger physical sizes , or perhaps to larger statistics , by using kogut - susskind quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the price that we pay is that it can be a painful exercise to figure out the lattice implementation of your desired operator and , more importantly , flavor symmetry is broken by effects of order @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> although they are of order @xmath2 , in practice the effects of flavor symmetry breaking are unpleasantly large at accessible lattice spacings . </S>",
    "<S> the situation can be greatly improved by the use of an improved action which suppresses the coupling of the quarks to high momentum gluons , as well as fixing up the quarks dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for some relevant references . </S>",
    "<S> the most important point is that exchange of a gluon with momentum near @xmath3 can scatter a low momentum quark from one corner of the brillioun zone into another , resulting in a mixing of different flavors . </S>",
    "<S> `` fattening '' the links , by averaging paths in the parallel transport , effectively puts a form factor into the quark - gluon vertex which suppresses such exchanges .

    "<S> @xcite the quark mass renormalization is calculated , and in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite renormalization constants for several operators are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the results are encouraging , with none of the coefficients coming out surprisingly large . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the conventional kogut - susskind action often has large one - loop corrections . </S>",
    "<S> this can again be understood in terms of a form factor suppressing coupling to high momentum gluons@xcite , so that a diagram like fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will not get large contributions when the quark is in another corner of the brillioun zone . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we suppress the unwanted doublers in the loop diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ scaling_fig ] shows the result of one scaling test of the improved kogut - susskind action . in this figure </S>",
    "<S> we plot the @xmath4 mass in units of the static quark potential as a function of lattice spacing . for the length scale we use @xmath5 , the distance where @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> all these points are from quenched simulations , and they are all interpolated to the quark mass where @xmath7 , or @xmath8 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> next one is motivated to ask whether it is practical to further improve the kogut - susskind action . at this conference dipierro and </S>",
    "<S> mackenzie reported on experiments with empirically tuning the coefficients of the paths in the action@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gains were limited , which they interpret as evidence of the need for four quark operators . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a one - loop improved action was presented , and methods for handling these four quark operators by introducing auxiliary bosonic fields were sketched . taking a different approach , a. hasenfratz and knechtli combined fattening of the links with a projection back onto unitary su(3 ) matrices in the `` hyp '' , for `` hypercubic blocking '' action@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this action produces smaller mass splittings among the pions than the @xmath2 tadpole action . </S>",
    "<S> these authors also describe an algorithm for dynamical simulation of this action , which can not be expressed in a simple way as a sum over paths .    in another theoretical development presented at this conference , </S>",
    "<S> levkova and manke have worked out an action for unimproved dynamical kogut - susskind quarks on an anisotropic lattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while their primary motivation is high temperature qcd , this approach could be useful for spectroscopy of glueballs , hybrids and excited states .    </S>",
    "<S> the milc collaboration has used the @xmath2 tadpole improved action for a set of hadron spectrum calculations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations used three flavors of dynamical quarks , as well as a quenched run and one two - flavor run , on lattices tuned to match the lattice spacing at about 0.13 fermi . for masses larger than the strange quark mass @xmath9 three degenerate flavors </S>",
    "<S> were used , while for smaller masses one quark mass was held fixed at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> quark masses down to @xmath10 , or @xmath11 , were used . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice size was @xmath12 , or @xmath13 fm . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some preliminary results at a finer lattice spacing of @xmath14 fm are available .    </S>",
    "<S> the big advantage of using lattices matched in lattice spacing and physical size for different numbers and masses of quarks is that the effects of dynamical quarks can be convincingly exposed . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest quantity that shows this is the static quark potential . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ potmatch_fig ] shows the potential in quenched qcd and in three - flavor qcd with all the quarks at the strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes of these two potentials agree at the point chosen to define the length scale , but their overall shape is different . </S>",
    "<S> notice that we do not see , and do not expect to see , string breaking in the distance range shown here . to quantify the change in shape we look at dimensionless quantities such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ r0_fig ] shows @xmath15 for the three flavor runs . </S>",
    "<S> it also contains two flavor results with wilson quarks from cppacs and sesam , and a two - flavor improved kogut - susskind point from milc .    </S>",
    "<S> one aspect of lattice spectroscopy where sea quarks are expected to have important effects is in the chiral behavior of hadron masses . in the case of the goldstone pion , at lowest order </S>",
    "<S> the squared pion mass is proportional to the quark mass , so corrections to this behavior can be displayed by plotting the squared pion mass divided by the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ mpisq_over_fig ] is such a plot for the milc runs in both full and quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the increase at the right side is understood as the transition from chiral behavior to heavy quark behavior , while the much sharper upturn at low quark mass is the expected chiral logarithm . </S>",
    "<S> although the quenched and three flavor curves look similar , the theoretical expectation is that the three flavor line has a finite limit as @xmath17 , while the quenched line diverges logarithmically . </S>",
    "<S> the quenched pion masses in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mpisq_over_fig ] are similar to earlier quenched results of kim and ohta using the conventional kogut - susskind action at a lattice spacing of about 0.46 fm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a crude comparison is in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mpisq_ko_fig ] , where i have arbitrarily rescaled both the vertical and horizontal axes to match the results at the strange quark mass .    while it is tempting to simply fit fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mpisq_over_fig ] to the chiral behavior predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is probably necessary to take account of the remaining flavor symmetry violations . </S>",
    "<S> claude bernard has been fitting this data both directly to the continuum form , and to a form that takes into account flavor symmetry violations using the lagrangian of lee and sharpe@xcite with empirically determined non - goldstone pion masses in each loop , to calculate corrections to the pion mass@xcite . in the quenched case , where the coefficient of the chiral logarithm can be a parameter </S>",
    "<S> , reasonable fits can be obtained both with and without the flavor symmetry breaking corrections . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coefficient of the logarithm comes out about 0.06 with the simple fitting , and about 0.14 when the flavor symmetry breaking is included . </S>",
    "<S> when the three flavor data is fit , with the coefficients of the logarithms determined by the chiral theory , good fits can only be obtained when the flavor symmetry breaking is included .    </S>",
    "<S> an application of these chiral corrections to the pion mass was presented at this conference by the ohio state group@xcite . here a particular combination of chiral lagrangian parameters was computed and found to be inconsistent with @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the boulder `` hyp '' action@xcite was used for the valence quarks in this project . in view of bernard </S>",
    "<S> s observations on the effects of flavor symmetry breaking , it is appropriate that they used a valence quark action which makes these effects as small as possible .    </S>",
    "<S> the milc spectrum calculations on matched quenched and three flavor lattices@xcite found some interesting differences between the quenched and full qcd spectra ( and at least one interesting lack of differences ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking difference is in the coupling of hadrons to two particle intermediate states , which is presumably present in full qcd calculations but is represented only by `` hairpin '' diagrams in quenched calculations . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ a0_decay_fig ] shows masses obtained for the isovector @xmath0 propagator on matched quenched and full qcd lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the low quark mass behavior of the full qcd results as an avoided level crossing between a @xmath19 state and a two meson @xmath20 state . in simple language </S>",
    "<S> , we are seeing a meson decay in the lattice simulations .    ' '' ''     + = 3.00 in    ' '' ''     </S>",
    "<S> +    ' '' ''     + = 3.00 in    ' '' ''     +    the ukqcd collaboration pointed out that the ratio `` j '' , defined as j = m_k^ * is a case where the quenched approximation produces an answer different from the real world@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ j_fig ] shows this ratio on the matched quenched and full qcd milc lattices , with a clear increase in the value when the sea quarks are included . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be compared with two flavor wilson quark simulations by the cppacs , ukqcd and jlqcd collaborations@xcite , which also show a larger value in two flavor qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon to rho mass ratio is a much studied quantity where lattice simulations typically disagree with the real world number . </S>",
    "<S> many groups have looked at this , and it has become clear that this quantity is especially sensitive to effects of the lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is interesting to use the matched lattices to look for effects of sea quarks . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ ape_both_fig ] shows this ratio in the milc calculations , with no discernable difference between the quenched and full qcd curves . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to ukqcd calculations on matched lattices with two flavors of wilson quarks , where the two flavor numbers are larger than the quenched ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 9 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . the two plusses in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ape_both_fig ] are quenched points at @xmath14 fm . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary three - flavor results at @xmath21 and @xmath22 fm show a similar trend . </S>",
    "<S> although this lattice spacing dependence is much less than seen with the conventional kogut - susskind action , it is clear that a careful continuum extrapolation will still be required for this quantity .    ' '' ''     </S>"
