    "a large ion collider experiment ( alice )  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been built to investigate the properties of a color - deconfined state of strongly interacting matter , that is formed in ultra - relativistic pb - pb collisions .",
    "flavor quarks ( charm and beauty ) are well  suited probes to study the hot and dense matter , called quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) . due to their large mass heavy ",
    "flavor quarks are produced in initial hard scattering processes on a very short time scale of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "after production they interact with the formed qgp and because of their early production they are sensitive to the full history of the collision . the experimental measurements to access the heavy - flavor sector , which are covered by these proceedings , are :    * fully reconstructed open charmed mesons @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the following hadronic decay channels : @xmath9 and the charge conjugates . @xmath10 and the charge conjugates . @xmath11 and the charge conjugates . *",

    "one important and well established quantity to characterize the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium is the nuclear modification factor @xmath12 studied as a function of transverse momentum @xmath13 .",
    "this quantity is defined as the ratio of the @xmath13 spectrum measured in aa collisions to the proton  proton spectrum at the same center  of  mass energy @xmath14 scaled by the number @xmath15 of binary nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions in the aa collision : @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the average nuclear overlap function calculated in a glauber model of the aa collision geometry .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath17 are dependent on the impact parameter b of the colliding nuclei , i.e.  on the collision centrality .",
    "the ratio @xmath18 equals unity in case of no nuclear effects . in a qgp quarks and gluons",
    "are expected to interact with the hot medium and lose energy . due to their smaller color charge than gluons ,",
    "quarks are expected to lose less energy than gluons .",
    "furthermore , qcd  theory predicts that the  dead - cone - effect  reduces the energy loss of massive charm and beauty quarks with respect to light quarks , see  @xcite .",
    "therefore the expected nuclear modification ordering in the range @xmath19 , where the heavy - quark masses are not negligible with respect to their momenta , is the following : @xmath20 , with @xmath21 denoting the nuclear modification factor of mostly gluon - originated pions , @xmath22 the nuclear modification factor of open charm d mesons and @xmath23 the nuclear modification factor of open beauty b mesons , see  @xcite . +",
    "another important quantity is the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath0 . in heavy ",
    "ion collisions the spatial anisotropy in the overlapping zone in non - central collisions is converted into a momentum anisotropy of the produced particles , if the in ",
    "medium mean free path allows for sufficient re  scattering . in this case , the azimuthal distribution of the emitted particles @xmath24 reflects the initial anisotropy , which can be parametrized via the coefficients of a fourier expansion @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the azimuth of the reaction plane in each expansion order @xmath27 .",
