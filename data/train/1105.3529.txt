    "valence bond solid ( vbs ) models introduced by affleck , kennedy , lieb and tasaki @xcite are exactly solvable models that exemplify the gapped ground states in integer-@xmath0 spin chains conjectured by haldane@xcite . though the vbs states , which are the exact ground states of the vbs models , are disordered spin liquids in the sense that their spin - spin correlations are exponentially dumped with a very short correlation length , there still exists a certain kind of `` hidden order '' captured by the non - local string parameter@xcite .",
    "the existence of the hidden order highlights the exotic features of the haldane - gapped antiferromagnets which are considered as manifestation of the topological order of quantum spin chain@xcite . with recent increasing interests in the topological states of matter spurred by the discovery of topological insulators",
    "[ see ref .",
    "for instance as a review ] , the vbs model and its variants are attracting renewed attention .",
    "since the vbs states enable us to calculate many interesting quantities exactly , they offer a rare theoretical playground for the study of topological states of matter . due to their peculiar features",
    ", the vbs - type states have been investigated in a wide variety of contexts like quantum information@xcite , topological order@xcite , entanglement entropy@xcite , higher symmetric generalizations@xcite , and topological phase transitions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the recently proposed@xcite supersymmetric generalization of valence bond solid ( svbs ) states .",
    "the svbs states are a precise mathematical realization of anderson s scenario of high-@xmath1 conductivity@xcite and the idea of symmetry unification of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "the svbs states are hole - pair doped vbs states containing both the charge sector and the spin sector ; depending on the magnitude of the hole - doping parameter , they exhibit both insulating and superconducting behaviors in the charge sector , while in the spin sector it always displays short - range spin correlations@xcite .",
    "the effects of mobile holes in the spin - gapped background are interesting in their own right not only in purely theoretical context@xcite but also in the experimental point of view@xcite .",
    "however , the impact of mobile holes on the ( hidden ) topological properties has been little studied . in what follows",
    ", we will show that the svbs states possess a kind of non - local topological order in the spin sector as well as local superconducting order in the charge sector , the latter of which is already known . while various ( ordinary ) correlation functions have been investigated already in ref .",

    "such susy of the svbs states is exact @xmath2 @xmath3 the magnitude of hole - doping parameter , and their parent hamiltonians can be readily constructed based on such ( super)symmetry .",
    "thus , the svbs models enable us to systematically study hole - doped antiferromagnets on such a firm mathematical background . to this end , we develop a supersymmetric version of the matrix product state ( mps ) representation of the vbs - type states@xcite .",
    "since the svbs states generally contain fermionic degrees of freedom , we generalize the mps formalism to include both fermionic and bosonic operators .",
    "this supersymmetric mps ( smps ) representation is useful not only in the sense of computational efficiency , but also from the topological - order point of view as the emergent edge degrees of freedom , which characterize the topological features , are automatically incorporated in the mps formalism@xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the mps formalism , which has been introduced@xcite originally as a special class of quantum ground states with short - range correlations , is now believed to be a natural framework to represent entangled quantum many - body states in 1d@xcite . in a similar sense ,",
    "the smps formalism would be applicable not only to the svbs states to be investigated in this paper but to a wider class of entangled many - body states that contain fermionic degrees of freedom .",

    "[ see appendix [ subsec : uosp12 ] for more details ] .",
    "the type - i svbs states@xcite ( [ svbsstatei ] ) , that contain ( fermionic ) hole degrees of freedom as well as the ( bosonic ) spin ones , are a generalization of the standard spin-@xmath0 vbs states@xcite . in the type - i svb states ( [ svbsstatei ] ) , the total particle number at each site is conserved : @xmath26 where the lattice coordination number @xmath27 is @xmath28 for the @xmath29-dimensional hypercubic lattice ( in what follows , @xmath30 unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "the integer @xmath31 plays a role of the spin quantum number @xmath32 in the usual vbs states .",

    "in the following sections , we consider the svbs states defined on one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain .",
    "a simplest susy - extension of the 1d spin-1 aklt ( vbs ) state@xcite is defined as ( @xmath36 , @xmath30 in eq.([svbsstatei ] ) ) : @xmath99 the ( non - hermitian instead of @xmath100 itself . ] ) parent hamiltonian for the susy ( uosp(@xmath101 ) ) vbs model is given as@xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively denote the uosp(@xmath101 ) casimir operator on a two - site cluster @xmath105 ( see eqs.([eqn : def - casimir],[eqn : casimir-2site ] ) for the definition of casimir operators ) and the projection operator onto @xmath106 subspace ( note that the total superspin @xmath107 of two @xmath108 superspins can take all integer- and half - integer values between 0 and 2 ; see eq.([eqn : cg - decomp ] ) ) .",
