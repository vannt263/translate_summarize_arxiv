    "in the last few years a substantial progress has been made in understanding of non - vacuum tunneling in field theory .",
    "the interest to this subject is inspired by attempts to calculate , in the standard model , the instanton - mediated baryon number violation in particle collisions at high energy  @xcite .",
    "although a variety of methods has been developed for calculating the tunneling probabilities at @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the height of the barrier ( the sphaleron energy in the electroweak theory ) , the behaviour of probabilities in the most interesting region @xmath9 is still unknown ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the question of whether the exponential suppression of baryon number violating processes disappears at some sufficiently high energy of colliding particles , still remains unanswered . since analytical approaches",
    "to tunneling induced by particle collisions seem to be exhausted , in the present paper we address this problem by means of numerical methods .    a suitable starting point for numerical study of non - vacuum tunneling",
    "is provided by the semiclassical approach developed in refs.@xcite . in this approach the key role is played by the probability of tunneling from a mixed state with fixed energy @xmath3 and number of particles @xmath2 .",
    "this probability is defined as follows , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the s - matrix , @xmath12 are projectors onto subspaces of fixed energy @xmath3 and fixed number of particles @xmath2 , respectively , while the states @xmath13 and @xmath14 are perturbative excitations above two vacua lying on different sides of the barrier .",
    "it was argued in refs.@xcite that at any fixed @xmath2 , the probability @xmath15 sets an upper bound for the two - particle cross section , while in the limit of small @xmath2 this probability reproduces the two - particle cross section with exponential accuracy .",
    "the advantage of considering multiparticle probability @xmath15 instead of two - particle one is that in the weak coupling regime @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the former can be calculated semiclassically and has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the number of particles produced in the sphaleron decay .",
    "the function @xmath22 is negative at low energies , which corresponds to exponential suppression of probability in this domain . at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( at the sphaleron ) ,",
    "the function @xmath22 vanishes , i.e. the exponential suppression disappears .",
    "the absence of exponential suppression of the two - particle cross section would show up as zero of the function @xmath22 at some fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath22 is determined by a solution to the specific classical boundary value problem for the complexified field equations  @xcite .",
    "namely , one has to solve the usual field equation @xmath27 where time and the field @xmath28 are treated as complex variables .",
    "all the information about particular problem is encoded into the boundary conditions , which are formulated on the contour abcd in the complex time plane ( see fig.1 ) . the asymptotic regions a and d correspond to the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions are as follows .",
    "the final boundary condition states that the field is real on the line cd , where it represents the classical evolution of the system after barrier penetration .",
    "this requirement can be imposed at the point c where it implies @xmath29 @xmath30 the part cd of the contour is not essential for formulation of these boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , this part does not play any role in the calculation of the function @xmath22 and can be dropped , unless the details of the final state are of interest . due to this fact the final boundary conditions ( [ bc 1 ] ) apply also to @xmath1 model where the stable vacuum does not exist and field develops a singularity in the final state , i.e. somewhere on the line cd ( point p in fig.1 ) .    at the other end of the contour , in the asymptotic region @xmath31 , the field is required to be linear .",
    "the initial boundary conditions fix the ratio of amplitudes in the negative- and positive - frequency parts to be a constant independent of momentum .",
    "if one writes general asymptotics of the field in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a real positive parameter , then the boundary condition is @xmath35 this equation fixes one particular linear combination of the field and its time derivative . in total",
    ", there are two real conditions at each end of the contour for the second order complex differential equation , so in general the boundary value problem is completely specified .    the input variables @xmath3 and @xmath2 enter the above boundary conditions through two parameters : @xmath34 , which enters the boundary conditions explicitly , and @xmath36 , which is the amount of euclidean evolution ( see fig.1 ) and specifies the place where initial boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the relation between @xmath36 , @xmath34 and @xmath3 , @xmath2 is given by the equations @xmath37,\\ ] ] @xmath38 , \\label{en eqs}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the action of the solution for given @xmath36 and @xmath34 , evaluated along the contour .",
    "note that according to boundary conditions ( [ bc 1 ] ) the field is real on the line cd , so that this part of the contour does not contribute into @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "alternatively , the energy and the number of particles can be read off from the initial asymptotics of the field , @xmath41 @xmath42 one can check that eqs.([en eqs ] ) and ( [ enspec ] ) coincide , provided that eqs.([field eq ] ) and ( [ bc 2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "given the solution to the boundary value problem one can calculate the function @xmath22 according to the formula @xmath43\\ , , \\label{f=}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath34 depend on @xmath3 and @xmath2 through eqs.([en eqs ] ) .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , as follows from eqs.([asymptotic form ] ) and ( [ bc 2 ] ) , at @xmath44 the solution is necessarily complex along the line ab . thus , contributions to the function @xmath22 come from both minkowskian ( ab ) and euclidean ( bc ) parts of the contour .",
    "second , as the field equations are analytic in time , the solution is also analytic everywhere except possible singularities .",
    "thus , the contour abc can be deformed , provided that the asymptotic region a is untouched and singularities are not crossed .",
    "in fact , one _ must _ expect singularities in between the contour abc and the negative part of the real time axis .",
    "otherwise the reality of the field at real @xmath45 and the initial boundary conditions are incompatible . in the model we consider below these singularities lie on the real time axis , as shown in fig.1 . in numerical calculations",
    "it is convenient to deform the contour in such a way that it passes far from singularities ( dotted line in fig.1 ) .    in one particular case , namely at @xmath46 ,",
    "the above boundary value problem simplifies considerably . in this case the initial boundary conditions , eq.([bc 2 ] ) , reduce to the reality condition imposed at @xmath47 .",
    "the solution to the resulting boundary value problem is given by periodic instanton of ref.@xcite .",
    "periodic instanton is a real periodic solution to the euclidean field equations with period @xmath48 and two turning points at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "being analytically continued to the minkowskian domain through the turning points , periodic instanton stays real at lines @xmath51 and @xmath47 and thus satisfies the boundary conditions with @xmath46 .",
    "the periodic instanton can be found analytically in two extreme cases : at @xmath52 it can be approximated by the periodic chain of instantons and antiinstantons , while at @xmath53 it is approximately given by the oscillations in the sphaleron negative mode . at intermediate energies",
    "the periodic instanton can be obtained numerically  @xcite . in the @xmath54@xmath55 plane ,",
    "periodic instantons form a line connecting the points @xmath56 ( zero energy instanton ) and @xmath57 ( sphaleron ) .",
    "the function @xmath22 monotonically grows from @xmath58 to @xmath59 along this line .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to numerical solution of the boundary value problem specified by eqs.([field eq ] ) , ( [ bc 1 ] ) and ( [ bc 2 ] ) in the general case @xmath60 , and investigation of the behaviour of the function @xmath22 at @xmath61 . for simplicity reasons we concentrate on particle - induced false vacuum decay in the theory with one scalar field .",
    "the choice of particular model turns out to be strongly constrained for technical reasons . after several attempts we ended up with four - dimensional @xmath1 theory with the mass term .",
    "the action of this model reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a positive constant . at non - zero",
    "@xmath64 the region @xmath65 and the instability region @xmath66 are separated by a finite energy barrier , and one can ask whether the presence of colliding particles enhances the probability of the barrier penetration ( i.e. , the decay of the metastable state @xmath67 ) .    it is a lucky coincidence that this model is of special interest for another reason , as it has many features reminiscent of bosonic sector of the electroweak theory . at @xmath68 ( zero higgs vacuum expectation value )",
    "both models are conformally invariant and possess instanton solutions . in the case of @xmath1 model",
    "the instanton @xcite has the action @xmath69 and describes the decay of the metastable state @xmath67 . at @xmath70 ( non - zero higgs vacuum expectation value )",
    "the conformal symmetry is softly broken and instanton solutions disappear , while the low energy transitions are described by constrained instantons  @xcite .",
    "the action ( [ sinst ] ) gets small energy - dependent correction and still determines the transition probability . like the electroweak theory",
    ", the @xmath1 model possesses the sphaleron solution .",
    "the energy of the sphaleron can be found numerically , @xmath71    before discussing the discrete formulation of the boundary value problem specified above , it is convenient to rewrite the action ( [ action ] ) in the dimensionless variables . since the problem is o(3)-symmetric , we restrict ourselves to @xmath72-wave scattering .",
    "the change of variables @xmath73 @xmath74 brings the action for spherically symmetric configurations to the form @xmath75 , \\label{action2}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the dimensionless radial distance . throughout the rest of this paper",
    "all dimensionfull quantities are measured in the units of mass .",
    "the starting point for our calculations is the discretized version of the action ( [ action2 ] ) .",
    "the system is put on a grid of the size @xmath77 with @xmath78 sites @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the time contour is represented by the set of complex points @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "the field @xmath83 transforms into the set of complex variables @xmath84 . to define integrations , we introduce two sets of intervals for each coordinate , @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 and similarly for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( tilted and non - tilted intervals are used to integrate fields and derivatives , respectively ) . with these definitions ,",
    "the discretized action reads @xmath90 , \\label{discrete action}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 @xmath92 equations of motion can be easily derived from this action by variation with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "we also need the discrete version of the boundary conditions .",
    "let us start with the final boundary conditions .",
    "the first equation ( [ bc 1 ] ) transforms into @xmath93 the discrete analog of the second equation can be derived from the requirement that the solution , being continued to the real time axis according to the _ discretized _ equations of motion , stays real .",
    "this requirement leads to the equations @xmath94    the discrete reformulation of the initial boundary conditions requires somewhat more work .",
    "it can be obtained by means of the following trick .",
    "let us make one step back and treat time as continuous variable .",
    "then we would obtain the @xmath95-dimensional quantum mechanical system with the action trivially derived from eq.([discrete action ] ) .",
    "since it is assumed that the field reaches linear regime in the initial asymptotic region , we can restrict ourselves to the quadratic part of the resulting action and diagonalize it numerically . in this way we obtain the discrete analog of the momentum representation .",
    "given the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors , it is straightforward to perform the decomposition of the field into positive- and negative - frequency parts and impose boundary conditions  ( [ bc 2 ] ) .",
    "eqs.([bc 2 ] ) are then translated into conditions imposed on some linear combinations of @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    ". these are the desired initial boundary conditions in the discrete formulation . to save space",
    "we do not present the corresponding cumbersome expressions .",
    "it is instructive to note that the above @xmath95-dimensional quantum mechanical system itself can be viewed as a model for studying tunneling transitions from the excited states in multidimensional systems .",
    "the action ( [ discrete action ] ) can be treated as discretized ( in time ) version of the action for this quantum mechanical system . in practice",
    "this means that particular number of lattice sites in space direction is not crucial for our conclusions , as long as linear regime can be reached at the initial part of the contour .",
    "to solve the boundary value problem for given values of @xmath36 and @xmath34 we use a multidimensional version of newton s method .",
    "this is a relaxation procedure which takes as input an approximate solution to the non - linear field equations and improves it at each iteration by solving the linearized equations in the background of the current approximation .",
    "iterations are repeated until non - linear equations are satisfied to the desired accuracy .",
    "the advantage of this algorithm is that its convergency requires neither positive - definiteness nor even reality of the action .",
    "moreover , the convergency is quadratic , provided that initial approximation is choosen sufficiently close to the solution . in practice ,",
    "the accuracy of @xmath98 is reached in 36 iterations .",
    "a drawback of the newton s method is that its basin of convergency can be very narrow .",
    "thus , it is important to have a good initial approximation at least for some values of @xmath36 and @xmath34",
    ". then one can move gradually in the @xmath36 ",
    "@xmath34 plane using output of each run as input for the next one . in our case",
    "the starting configuration is provided by the periodic instanton which , at @xmath99 , can be approximated by sphaleron plus harmonic oscillation in the sphaleron negative mode ( both the sphaleron and its negative mode have to be found numerically ) .",
    "the period of the periodic instanton at @xmath100 is determined by the sphaleron negative eigenvalue and equals @xmath101 the amplitude of the oscillation goes to zero when @xmath102 .",
    "so , we take @xmath103 , @xmath46 , and adjust the amplitude of the oscillation in order to get inside the basin of convergency of the periodic instanton with the period @xmath36 . in this way",
    "we obtain the very first solution to our boundary value problem .",
    "changing @xmath36 by small steps we then reproduce the whole family of periodic instantons with different periods .",
    "calculations show that in the @xmath1 model the period of the periodic instanton varies from @xmath104 to zero when the energy decreases from @xmath4 to zero .",
    "this unusual behaviour of period with energy is much in common with that in the o(3 ) sigma model @xcite , where it is also related to softly broken conformal invariance .",
    "on the basis of this similarity one should expect the analogous behaviour in the electroweak theory .",
    "the newton s method reduces the non - linear boundary value problem to sequential solution of a few _ linear _ boundary value problems . at each iteration , to find the correction @xmath105 to the current approximation amounts to one matrix inversion , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a matrix of second derivatives of the action and @xmath108 is a vector of first derivatives , both evaluated at the background .",
    "the matrix @xmath107 has the dimension @xmath109 , the factor 2 being due to the complexity of the field . in general ,",
    "the computer time necessary for inversion of such a matrix scales like @xmath110 .",
    "one can use , however , the fact that this matrix originates from the local second order differential equation and thus is sparse .",
    "the sparseness enables one to invert this matrix in @xmath111 operations .",
    "note that for systems containing @xmath112 fields instead of one , this number would be @xmath113 . in practice , to find one solution to the boundary value problem at the grid of dimension @xmath114 takes about 5 minutes at sparcstation 20 , most of this time being spent for matrix inversion .",
    "the necessary amount of memory scales like @xmath115 and for the above grid is of order 10 mb .",
    "let us now discuss constraints on other grid parameters .",
    "the most restrictive requirement is that the field must reach linear regime in the asymptotic region a. for that the number of independent modes ( which equals @xmath95 ) must be large enough , and the length of minkowskian part of the contour , @xmath116 , must be sufficient to let the energy spread over these modes .",
    "since in the minkowskian region the most of the field propagates along the light cone , the space size @xmath77 should be larger than @xmath116 to avoid boundary effects .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice spacing in @xmath117 direction , @xmath118 , should be small enough not only to be close to the continuum limit , but also because otherwise the free spectrum would be cut at too low frequency , @xmath119 .",
    "this would impose constraints on the available region in the @xmath3@xmath2 space , @xmath120 , and would not allow for the initial states consisting of small number of high energy particles .",
    "thus , all these arguments push towards large @xmath95 , which is however bound at relatively low value @xmath121 by the abilities of available computers .",
    "the number of time slices @xmath122 is not so constrained since the required computer resources scale linearly with @xmath122 . in our calculations",
    "we take @xmath122 few times larger than  @xmath95 in order to saturate the continuum limit in time .",
    "this number is different for different @xmath36 and @xmath34 .",
    "the particular choice of parameters is model - dependent and is made by trial and error . in the model",
    "we consider here rather small value @xmath123 is sufficient to reach linear regime starting from the vicinity of the sphaleron configuration .",
    "fast linearization is the advantage of high - dimensional models @xcite and is due to the volume factor ( note @xmath124 in the interaction term in eq.([action2 ] ) ) .",
    "this effect is absent in two - dimensional models .",
    "moreover , in @xmath1 model , the value @xmath123 is sufficient for linearization at least up to energies @xmath125 .",
    "this feature differs the above model from other four - dimensional models we have tried .",
    "fast linearization allows to take relatively small space size , @xmath126 , which leads to the sufficiently wide spectrum already at @xmath127 .",
    "the free spectrum for these values of parameters reproduces the continuum spectrum with reasonable accuracy up to @xmath128 .",
    "the results presented in this this paper were obtained at @xmath126 , @xmath123 , @xmath127 and @xmath122 varying from @xmath129 to @xmath130 . for these values of grid parameters",
    "we have found about 1500 solutions to the boundary value problem with different @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the region of @xmath54@xmath55 plane covered by the solutions is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the top left corner of the solution region ( point s in fig.2 ) is the sphaleron .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath57 . at this point",
    "the function @xmath22 vanishes and exponential suppression of probability disappears .    towards small energies the solution region is bound by the line of periodic instantons ( the line sp in fig.2 ) . in the continuum limit",
    "this line would end up at the point @xmath56 which corresponds to the zero energy instanton .",
    "however , the spatial size of periodic instantons rapidly decreases along this line . at the above values of grid parameters , the instanton size becomes comparable to the lattice spacing at @xmath131 ( the point p in fig.2 ) . at this point",
    "the newton s algorithm stops to converge . along the line of periodic instantons , the function",
    "@xmath22 monotonically decreases and reaches the value @xmath132 at the point p.    the boundary of convergency continues at approximately constant @xmath55 towards higher energy .",
    "it is represented by the line pq in fig.2 .",
    "the function @xmath133 is negative along this line .",
    "the third boundary of the solution region is formed by the line @xmath134 ( solid line in fig.2 ) .",
    "it starts at the sphaleron and goes towards higher energy and smaller number of particles . at energy @xmath135",
    "it comes close to the boundary of convergency , which makes finite the available part of @xmath54@xmath55 plane .",
    "our data cover this available region .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the dependence of the function @xmath133 on energy and number of particles .",
    "it is most conveniently represented by the lines of constant @xmath133 in the @xmath54@xmath55 plane .",
    "these lines can be obtained by interpolation and are shown in fig.3 .",
    "they start at the line of periodic instantons with infinite negative slope .",
    "the latter can be seen analytically . indeed , from eqs.([en eqs ] ) and",
    "( [ f= ] ) one immediately derives that @xmath136 the slope @xmath137 becomes infinite at the periodic instantons where @xmath46 .",
    "the function @xmath22 determines the maximum probability of induced false vacuum decay among @xmath2-particle initial states .",
    "the line @xmath134 separates the classically forbidden and classically allowed regions .",
    "we see from fig.3 that for each energy @xmath138 there exists a minimum number of particles @xmath139 for which the decay may occur classically without exponential suppression . at @xmath140 one",
    "thus may expect the existence of classical configurations which pass above the barrier . on the other hand , at @xmath141",
    "all classical solutions bounce off the barrier . by continuity ,",
    "when @xmath2 approaches @xmath142 from above , the classical solutions which pass above the barrier should spend more and more time on its top oscillating above the sphaleron , so that in the limit @xmath143 this time goes to infinity .    at @xmath141 ,",
    "the decay is a tunneling event which is described by corresponding solution to our boundary value problem . as discussed above ,",
    "the real time part of this tunneling solution represents the classical evolution of the system after barrier penetration . in our model",
    "this evolution leads to the singularity ( point p in fig.1 ) . in between two singularities on the real time axis ,",
    "the tunneling solution represents the field which comes from infinity , bounces off the barrier and goes back to infinity .",
    "when @xmath2 approaches @xmath142 from below , the distance between two singularities grows ( see fig.4 ) and the solution spends more and more time around the sphaleron .",
    "although due to instabilities we were not able to trace the positions of singularities when the distance between them becomes of order one , we expect that at the line @xmath134 this distance goes to infinity and the real time part of the tunneling solution reproduces the infinitely oscillating classical solution described above .",
    "thus , the configurations which correspond to the line @xmath134 should be classical solutions infinitely oscillating above the sphaleron .    due to the existence of minimum number of particles at fixed energy @xmath3 , one can try to obtain the line @xmath134 by minimizing @xmath2 over the set of classical solutions which pass above the barrier .",
    "this strategy was used in ref.@xcite to set bounds on the forbidden region .",
    "we have tried to use this strategy to reproduce the line @xmath134 found by the tunneling approach .",
    "we have obtained bounds which are noticeably higher than the real position of this line .",
    "the reason could be that the classical solutions which correspond to the line @xmath134 are infinitely oscillating around the sphaleron and thus are singular points of the space of solutions which pass above the barrier .    as one can see from fig.3 , the size of allowed region increases towards higher energy ,",
    "while the minimum number of particles for which the decay is not exponentially suppressed , decreases . we have traced this behaviour up to @xmath144 where the absence of convergency prevents us from going further with the same grid parameters .",
    "since the probability @xmath15 is an upper bound for the two - particle cross section at energy @xmath3 , we conclude that the latter cross section is exponentially suppressed at @xmath145 .",
    "moreover , extrapolating the behaviour of @xmath139 and assuming that the derivative @xmath146 continues to decrease in absolute value , one can see that the line @xmath134 does not cross the @xmath147 axis at least up to @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we conclude that exponential suppression of the two - particle cross section persists at least up to @xmath7",
    ".    careful look at the data shows that the behaviour of the function @xmath22 may qualitatively change at substantially lower energy . to see this",
    "consider the slope of the lines of constant @xmath133 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the derivative @xmath137 can be expressed through the known parameters according to eq.([dnde ] ) .",
    "its behaviour with energy is shown in fig.5 .",
    "extrapolating , one can see that it would become zero at @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "if this indeed happens , then starting at this energy the line @xmath134 in coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath2 would turn up ( @xmath150 would become positive ) , while the function @xmath151 at @xmath152 would decrease with energy .",
    "clearly , this behaviour is unphysical .",
    "indeed , it is always possible to put the excess energy @xmath153 in one quantum particle and thus effectively decrease the energy involved in the semiclassical tunneling , leaving the number of particles practically unchanged",
    ". the corresponding initial state would not be semiclassical , and its probability of tunneling would be @xmath154 , i.e. higher than follows from the semiclassical picture .",
    "if this situation realizes , it is natural to expect that starting at @xmath155 the correct function @xmath151 stays constant and thus the line @xmath134 never crosses the @xmath147 axis .",
    "the latter would mean that the two - particle cross section is always exponentially suppressed .    as is clear from fig.3 , in order to go to higher energies and verify the above conclusions based on extrapolation",
    ", one has to extend the convergency region towards smaller number of particles .",
    "the breakdown of convergency is most likely related to the lattice spacing in @xmath117 direction .",
    "we have checked that doubling @xmath95 at fixed @xmath77 extends the convergency region for periodic instanton solutions .",
    "we expect that the same effect persists at @xmath44 .",
    "thus , increasing @xmath95 could be the way to extend the convergency region and improve our results .",
    "this , however , will require noticeably more computer resources .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to stress again the analogy , as long as instanton - like transitions are concerned , between the @xmath1 model and the bosonic sector of the electroweak theory . on the basis of this analogy , we expect that the electroweak theory is also a suitable model for studying instanton - like transitions numerically .",
    "since , because of larger number of fields , calculations there are at least @xmath156 times slower , they would require the use of computers much faster than a typical workstation .",
