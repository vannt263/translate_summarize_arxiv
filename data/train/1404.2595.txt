    "the reason being that these will be correlated between epochs and are negligible in comparison to the intrinsic color uncertainty , that we also assume to be fully correlated .",

    "we carry out the fit iteratively to all bands except f555w and f631n , the former completely includes our reference band and the latter is too narrow for our assumption of sn2014jand sn2011febeing comparable to hold .",

    "these reddened lightcurves are similar to the original , but for the blue bands , and in particular in the uv , the lightcurves are significantly broader , and show a similar decline as the observed data of sn2014j .",
    "we take this as yet another confirmation that sn2011feindeed is very similar to sn2014jand therefore suitable to use as reference for the extinction study presented here .",
    "we further conclude ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that the difference in lightcurve width between the original lightcurves in the bluer bands mainly stems from the fact that we are probing redder effective wavelengths for sn2014jthan for sn2011fewhen comparing the same passbands .",
    "this also has implications for fig .",
    "[ fig : extinctionlaw ] .",
    "here we have calculated the weighted average for each color taking the full covariance into account .",

    "both of these filters suffer from minor red leaks , e.g. for f218w0.3% of the light comes from wavelengths redder than @xmath72 . on the other hand , a sn  iaat maximum with the reddening of sn2014jwill typically be @xmath73  orders of magnitude brighter at @xmath72   compared to the central wavelength of the f218wfilter .",
