    "[ [ section ] ]    a very efficient tool in diophantine geometry is the so - called determinant method which was developed by bombieri and pila in the influential paper @xcite about the number of integral points of bounded height on affine algebraic and transcendental plane curves .",
    "basically , the method consists in using a determinant of a suitable set of monomials evaluated at the integral points , in order to construct a family of auxiliary polynomials vanishing at all integral points on the curve within a small enough box .",
    "building on the estimates in @xcite for algebraic curves , pila proved in @xcite bounds on the number of integral ( resp .",
    "rational ) points of bounded height on affine ( resp .",
    "projective ) algebraic varieties of any dimension , improving on previous results by s. d. cohen using the large sieve method @xcite .",
    "important further improvements going towards optimal bounds conjectured by serre in  13 of @xcite have been made since by heath - brown , browing and salberger @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "pila and wilkie proved a general estimate for the number of rational points on the transcendental part of sets definable in an o - minimal structure ; this has been used in a spectacular way by pila to provide an unconditional proof of some cases of the andr - oort conjecture @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for surveys on applications in diophantine geometry of the pila - wilkie theorem ) .",
    "lying at the heart of pila and wilkie s approach is the possibility of having uniform - in terms of number of parametrizations and in terms of bounds on the partial derivatives - @xmath2-parametrizations .",
    "these parametrizations are provided by an o - minimal version of gromov s algebraic parametrization lemma @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , itself a refinement of a previous result of yomdin @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such @xmath2-parametrizations enter the determinant method via taylor approximation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a version of the yomdin - gromov lemma in the non - archimedean setting , notably for subanalytic sets over @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and to develop the determinant method in this context in order to obtain non - archimedean analogues of some of the results in diophantine geometry mentionned above . at first sight",
    "one may have doubts about the realizability of such a program , since because of the totally disconnected character of non - archimedean spaces , it seems there is no way for a global taylor formula to make sense in this framework . a first indication that the situation may not be completely hopeless , is provided by the fact that in previous work @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    "we have been able to prove a version of first - order taylor approximation , piecewise globally , in the definable @xmath0-adic setting . in the present paper , though we extend this first order result to a much wider situation , we have chosen not trying to generalize it to higher order , but instead we show directly the existence of uniform @xmath2-parametrizations that do satisfy taylor approximation , which is enough for our purpose .",
    "the existence of such parametrizations is provided by theorem [ gyt ] which is the main result of section [ sec:2 ] . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we deduce a @xmath0-adic analogue of the theorem of pila and wilkie in @xcite , in the strengthened version given by pila in @xcite in terms of blocks . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we prove a geometric analogue of results of bombieri - pila @xcite and pila @xcite over @xmath4 where counting number of points is replaced by counting dimensions .",
    "the diophantine applications we give in the @xmath0-adic case ( concerning the density of rational points on the transcendental part of definable sets ) and the motivic case ( concerning the density of rational points on algebraic sets ) are quite different .",
    "one should notice that in the algebraic case , working over @xmath3 instead of @xmath5 would not provide better estimates than those following directly from the archimedean ones in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ [ ssec:1.2 ] ]    let us spell out in some more detail basic versions of three of our results for subanalytic @xmath0-adic sets .    one calls a set @xmath6 semialgebraic if it is definable in the ring language with parameters from @xmath7 . by adding to the ring language symbols for analytic functions , one obtains subanalytic sets",

    "the following statement follows from theorem [ algheights ] :    let @xmath6 be a subanalytic set of dimension @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 and an integer @xmath61 be given .",
    "then there exist an integer @xmath63 and a semialgebraic set @xmath64 such that @xmath38 lies inside @xmath29 , and such that for each @xmath39 , one has @xmath65",
    "our proofs of theorems [ algheights ] and [ blocksq ] rely on the existence of reparametrizations provided by theorem [ gyt ] , where we prove the following :    let @xmath66 , @xmath9 and @xmath67 be integers and let @xmath68 be a subanalytic set of dimension @xmath33",
    ". then there exists a finite collection of subanalytic functions @xmath69 such that the union of the @xmath70 equals @xmath17 , the @xmath71 have @xmath72-norm bounded by @xmath32 , and the @xmath71 are approximated by their taylor polynomials of degree @xmath73 with remainder of order @xmath45 , globally on @xmath74 .    for precise definitions of the @xmath72-norm and approximation by taylor polynomials of certain degree with controlled remainder",
    ", we refer to definition [ tr ] .",
    "note that a key point in this non - archimedean statement is that the approximation holds globally on @xmath74 , which represents a challenging goal because of total disconnectedness . on the opposite , in the real case",
    ", it is enough to consider convex charts , since for such charts global taylor approximation is immediate . in the core of the paper all these results will be stated and proved uniformly for definable families .",
    "[ [ ssec:1.3 ] ]    we end this introduction with a quick overview of our results over the base field @xmath5 . in this case , the analogue of theorem [ gyt ] essentially still holds , except one has to replace `` finite '' by `` parametrized by a constructible subset of @xmath75 for some @xmath46 '' .    for each positive integer @xmath45",

    "lemma [ trivest ] ) .",
    "assume @xmath17 is irreducible of degree @xmath86 .",
    "the main result of section [ sec:4 ] , theorem [ motivicbp ] , states that , for every positive integer @xmath45 , one has @xmath87 which is an improvement on the basic estimate as soon as @xmath17 is not linear .",
    "this result can be seen as an instance of motivic point counting , like in the paper @xcite , where in a somewhat different context a detailed study of the motivic height zeta function leads to asymptotic estimates for dimensions of spaces of sections .",
    "it is a motivic analogue of pila s results of @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we reduce to the case of plane curves by lang - weil type arguments .",
    "however , to prove the result in this case , we do not follow the original method of bombieri and pila in @xcite , which seems difficult to adapt in this setting .",
    "we follow instead a strategy introduced by marmon in @xcite , which relies on the yomdin - gromov lemma in place of the elaborate analytic arguments used in @xcite .",
    "although the general results on lipschitz continuity of theorems [ lip ] and [ lipmixed ] are used to prove theorems [ gyt ] and [ gyts ] , as far as our applications to points of bounded height are concerned , they are not needed in full generality .",
    "first , in the @xmath0-adic setting of section [ sec:3 ] , theorems [ lip ] and [ lipmixed ] are not new since they are proved in @xcite and even appear in a slightly sharper form in @xcite . secondly , in section [ sec:4 ] when working over @xmath88 ,",
    "only the one - dimensional case of theorem [ gyt ] , namely with @xmath89 , is used .",
    "this case of theorem [ gyt ] only relies on the one - dimensional case of theorem [ lip ] , which can be proved similarly as the one - dimensional case of @xcite .",
    "such one - dimensional cases require less work and are easier to prove than the general cases .",
    "for example , for the case of general dimension for theorems [ lip ] and [ lipmixed ] one can not use definable sections as in @xcite and we had to find the alternative approach via theorem [ lipcenter ] ; in the one - dimensional case definable sections were not used in @xcite .",
    "another simplification , in the @xmath0-adic case , would be to exploit the fact that the residue rings @xmath90 are finite .",
    "indeed , this finiteness allows one to zoom and scale as in the real case , and this can serve as an alternative to the passage to the algebraic closure of @xmath91 when proving theorems [ gyt ] and [ gyts ] for @xmath8 .",
    "this zoom and scale technique would not work in the case of @xmath92 , unless one is content in theorem [ motivicbp ] with a weakening of the upper bound to @xmath93 , for some constant depending on @xmath86 .",
    "we would like to thank antoine chambert - loir , immanuel halupczok and ehud hrushovski for stimulating discussions related to this work .",
    "in particular , antoine chambert - loir directed us to marmon s paper , immanuel halupczok provided an example that finitely many pieces do not suffice in general for theorem [ lip ] , and ehud hrushovski encouraged us to consider potential diophantine applications .    the authors were supported in part by the european research council under the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) with erc grant agreement numbers",

    "the paper was finalized while the authors participated in the msri program : model theory , arithmetic geometry and number theory .",
    "in this section and in the next one we prove non - archimedean analogues of the yomdin - gromov parametrization lemma . in the same time , we prove that our parametrizations can be uniformly approximated by their taylor polynomials .",
    "the ability to approximate parametrizations by their taylor polynomials with small error terms is key for counting points of bounded height in the non - archimedean case , as well as in the real case , although in the real case this approximation is classical when the domain is convex and boundeof order @xmath94 ( see theorem [ gyt ] ) .",
    "the yomdin - gromov parametrization lemma , as generalized by pila and wilkie in @xcite , gives for any bounded definable set @xmath17 of dimension @xmath33 in @xmath95 ( in an o - minimal structure on @xmath96 ) and any integer @xmath97 a finite collection of definable maps @xmath98^m\\to x$ ] whose ranges together cover @xmath17 and whose @xmath72-norms are bounded by @xmath32 . by convexity of @xmath99^m$ ] , and techniques based on the mean value theorem , one can control the error terms when approximating @xmath100 by a taylor polynomial of degree @xmath73 . both convexity and the mean value theorem",

    "where @xmath104 , the desired approximation coincides with lipschitz continuity , and the study of piecewise lipschitz continuity , in a general non - archimedean context , is the content of sections [ sec:5b ] and [ sec : mix ] . from section [ sec : gyt ] on",
    ", we will place ourselves in a more concrete framework of definable sets in complete , discretely valued fields ( possibly with extra restricted analytic functions in the language ) , to treat @xmath72-parametrizations with good taylor approximation when @xmath101 .      in @xcite , piecewise lipschitz - continuity for a semialgebraic or subanalytic function @xmath105",
    "is shown to hold whenever @xmath102 is locally lipschitz continuous with a fixed lipschitz constant . moreover ,",
    "the pieces can be taken to be definable . in @xcite ,",
    "the lipschitz constants were further controlled in an optimal way when going from local to global on each piece . in this section ,",
    "we extend the result of @xcite in two ways , namely to many new structures with a non - archimedean geometry , including @xmath5 , and to other languages than the semialgebraic and subanalytic ones , including some weaker languages without multiplication .",
    "when the residue field is not finite , one is led to replace finite definable partitions by definable families with parameters running over the residue field .",
    "our study of lipschitz continuity is subdivided into two cases : equicharacteristic zero and mixed characteristic . both are axiomatically treated . in the mixed characteristic case , residue rings , and not only the residue field , are used .",
    "we first introduce the set - up adapted to the equicharacteristic zero case . the typical example to have in mind",
