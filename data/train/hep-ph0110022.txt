    "the advent of the @xmath8 factories , babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite , opens new perspectives for very precise measurements of non - leptonic @xmath8-decays  @xcite and calls for a significant improvement of the theoretical predictions . in this respect ,",
    "important progress has been recently achieved by systematic studies of factorization in @xmath8 decays  @xcite .",
    "these studies confirmed the physical idea  @xcite that factorization holds in heavy hadron decays , @xmath9 , for the leading terms of the @xmath10 expansion .",
    "they leave open , however , the central question of whether i ) the leading terms predict with sufficient accuracy the relevant @xmath8-meson decay rates or ii ) the power - suppressed corrections , which can not be evaluated without some model assumption , are phenomenologically important .",
    "this problem has been addressed in a series of papers  @xcite@xcite . in particular , the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that _ non - perturbative _ @xmath2 corrections from the leading operators of the effective weak hamiltonian , conventionally called charming ( or gim ) penguins , are very important in cases where the factorized amplitudes are either colour or cabibbo suppressed .",
    "one of the consequences of this observation is that factorization at the leading order in @xmath2 is unable to reproduce the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath3s even taking into account the uncertainties of the input parameters .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite seem to be at variance with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite where it is stated that , in the qcd factorization approach , `` an acceptable fit to the branching fractions is obtained even if we impose @xmath11 as implied by the standard constraints on the unitarity triangle ''   and ref .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath12 . ] .",
    "given the contradictory conclusions of the different studies , it is very important to clarify the situation by comparing input parameters , methods of analysis and results . in order to help the debate on this subject",
    ", we discuss in the following :    * the theoretical framework of factorization and the calculation of the amplitudes at the leading order of the @xmath2 expansion ; * a comparison of the leading terms , including their uncertainties , with the measured @xmath0 and @xmath1 branching ratios ; * results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath3s including charming ( and gim ) penguins ; * a comparison of the results obtained with charming and gim penguins  @xcite with the model of the @xmath2 corrections adopted in @xcite .",
    "in this section we recall the basic ingredients necessary to compute the relevant amplitudes either whithin factorization or including the corrections which arise at higher order in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the physical amplitudes for @xmath1 and @xmath13 can be conveniently written in terms of rg - invariant parameters built using the wick contractions of the effective hamiltonian  @xcite . in the heavy quark limit , following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to compute these rg invariant parameters using factorization . the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite has been developed so that it is also possible to include the perturbative corrections to order @xmath14 , i.e. at the next - to - leading order in perturbation theory  .    for the sake of discussion , it is instructive to start from the explicit expression of the @xmath15 amplitude . in terms of the parameters defined in  @xcite , this amplitude reads @xmath16 we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the factorized matrix elements and @xmath19 the parameters introduced in  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) and  ( [ eq : due ] ) are exact .",
    "unfortunately , similar equations require the knowledge of several non - perturbative parameters , which at present can not be extracted from the data . to be predictive",
    ", we will then use our physical intuition to reduce their number . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) and ( [ eq : due ] ) :    1 .",
    "the ckm matrix elements can either be taken from other experimental measurements or from a fit to the non - leptonic @xmath3s , assuming that factorization is accurate enough ; 2 .   the coefficients @xmath20 ( e.g. @xmath21 ) are renormalization group invariant , as the corresponding factorized matrix elements , and have been computed perturbatively at the nlo in refs .",
    "@xcite ; 3 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which have also been computed to one - loop order , are instead scheme dependent .",
    "their scheme - dependence is cancelled by the hadronic matrix elements of the penguin operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "assuming factorization for the chirally enhanced contributions  @xcite , the latter can be expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath26 which is formally of @xmath27 but numerically important ( an analogous parameter @xmath28 can be defined for @xmath29 decays ) .",
    "we will discuss the rle of these terms below .",
    "the leading amplitudes @xmath18 are computed in terms of decay constants and semi - leptonic form factors .",
    "the form factors can either be taken from theoretical calculations  @xcite or fitted from the experimental @xmath3s ( the possibility of extracting them from the corresponding @xmath30 semileptonic form factor at small momentum transfer is at present rather remote ) . 5 .",
    "the tilded parameters , namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are genuine , non - perturbative @xmath2 corrections which can not be computed at present .",
    "if we neglect zweig - suppressed contributions , by @xmath34 symmetry one can show that all the cabibbo - enhanced @xmath2 corrections to @xmath1 decays can be reabsorbed in @xmath35 .",
    "several corrections are contained in @xmath35 : this parameter includes not only the charming penguin contributions , but also annihilation and penguin contractions of penguin operators .",
    "it does not include leading emission amplitudes of penguin operators ( @xmath36@xmath37 ) which have been explicitly evaluated using factorization .",
    "had we included these terms , this contribution would exactly correspond to the parameter @xmath38 of ref .",
    ". the parameter @xmath35 ( @xmath39 ) encodes automatically not only the effect of the annihilation diagrams considered in  @xcite , but all the other contributions of @xmath27 with the same quantum numbers of the charming penguins . in this respect",
    "it is the most general parameterization of all the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions of the operators @xmath40 and @xmath24 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , including the worrying higher - twist infrared divergent contribution to annihilation discussed in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 has the same quantum numbers and physical effects as the original charming penguins proposed in  @xcite , although it has a more general meaning .",
    "if one also includes @xmath0 decays we have several other parameters , for example @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite . a closer look to @xmath44 shows that this term is due either to zweig suppressed annihilation diagrams ( called cpa and dpa in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or to annihilation diagrams which are colour suppressed with respect to those entering @xmath35 . for this reason in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath44 was taken to be zero .",
    "@xmath45 is equal to the corresponding parameter in @xmath46 decays if @xmath47 symmetry is assumed . in our analysis",
    "we have used the same value of @xmath48 for all @xmath46 and @xmath49 channels .",
    "@xmath43 will be discussed later on .",
    "we are now ready to discuss _ factorization _ for the leading terms of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "factorization is the theory of non leptonic decays which is obtained in the limit @xmath50 . thus it consists in neglecting _ all _ terms of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc . ) . at lowest order in perturbation theory ,",
    "called also nave factorization , the @xmath55 are simple combinations of the wilson coefficients and do not depend on the hadron wave functions .",
    "the inconvenience of nave factorization is that physical amplitudes still have a marked dependence on the renormalization scale because , contrary to the wilson coefficients , the factorized matrix elements are scale independent .",
    "the scale dependence is reduced by working at @xmath56 , both for the wilson coefficients and the matrix elements . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that , at this order , all the dangerous infrared divergences can be reabsorbed in the definition of the hadronic wave functions . for the leading terms in the @xmath2 expansion",
    "there are strong arguments to support the idea that this will remain true at all orders in @xmath14 , see also ref .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath57 , it is likely that factorization is preserved by strong interactions . at @xmath56 or higher ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath55 depend on the specific detail of the hadron wave - fuctions .",
    "for this reason , the uncertainties relative to the wave functions , as the residual renormalization scale dependence , must be taken into account in the evaluation of the uncertainties for the theoretical predictions .",
    "the approximation in which we neglect all the @xmath2 corrections , but include the perturbative corrections to the leading contribution , is called qcd factorization or simply factorization .",
    "factorization implies an important consequence : predictions of non - leptonic decay rates are _ model independent _ to the extent that the few relevant hadronic parameters , namely the kaon and pion decay constants , @xmath58 , the semileptonic form factors , @xmath59 , and the hadronic wave functions are known .    in cases",
    "like @xmath1 decays , where the factorized amplitudes are cabibbo suppressed , the corrections of @xmath27 , which unfortunately are _ model dependent _ , become important . at lowest order in @xmath14 , the chirally enhanced terms proportional to @xmath60 ( @xmath61 )",
    "are computable by assuming that factorization can be applied beyond the leading order .",
    "a substantial difficulty arises , however , at @xmath62 .",
    "although the chirally enhanced corrections from @xmath63 are infrared finite , other contributions of the same order from different operators are infrared divergent , signaling that they belong to the class of the non - perturbative contributions which appear beyond factorization .",
    "these can not be predicted using the same hadronic quantities of the factorized amplitudes .",
    "for this reason , any phenomenological analysis which aims at including in a coeherent way the terms of @xmath64 is forced to introduce extra model - dependent non - perturbative parameters besides @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the hadronic wave functions .",
    "this implies that , _ at @xmath51 ,",
    "model dependence is unavoidable _ ( even in the subsector of the chirally enhanced contributions ) and it is present in both the analyses of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , which we will compare below .",
    "different model - dependent assumptions were made in the two approaches :    1 .   in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath65 and @xmath66 were neglected and @xmath34 symmetry was assumed for @xmath67 ( @xmath47 when it was used for @xmath68 decays ) .",
    "the same approximations were made for @xmath69 .",
    "the complex parameter @xmath35 ( @xmath69 ) was then fitted to reproduce the experimental @xmath3s .",
    "2 .   in ref .  @xcite the effects of the chirally enhanced @xmath2 corrections were either computed perturbatively or encoded in two complex phenomenological parameters called @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "an uncertainty of 100 @xmath72 to the `` default '' values ( e.g. @xmath73 ) was assigned to these parameters in order to determine allowed bands for the predicted @xmath3s .",
    "the bands include all other sources of uncertainties .",
    "we now compare the leading amplitudes to the experimental results in order to _",
    "test factorization_. before using predictions based on factorization to test the standard model and look for signals of new physics , it is crucial to check how large are the errors induced by our ignorance of the @xmath51 corrections which we are unable to compute .",
    "our position , indeed , is that we have more confidence in the sm rather than in factorization . in order to test factorization",
    ", we ought to use all the information that we have from other measurements .",
    "thus , for example , whereas the size of the error on @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be debated , there is no question that these experimental inputs must be included in any analysis that aims at testing ( or using ) factorization .",
    "we also stress that the value of @xmath75 is not expected to be affected by the presence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the cp parameter @xmath4 does in general change if there is physics beyond the sm .",
    "it remains an interesting exercise , however , to verify whether , by taking the value of @xmath4 from the unitarity triangle analysis ( uta ) in the sm , the predicted @xmath3s are in agreement with the data .",
    "if , by using @xmath4 from the uta , one is unable to reproduce the experimental @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath3s , this implies that `` either there is new physics or @xmath2 corrections are important ''  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we have used the likelihood method which has been described in all details in ref .",
    "@xcite . without entering in the `` ideological '' controversy about frequentistic and bayesian methods , we only note here that in  @xcite it has been shown that , at 95 % c.l . , the bayesian analysis give the same results as the frequentistic babar scanning method ( and its variations ) when the same inputs are used .",
    "thus we will present our contour plots , corresponding to fig .",
    "17 of ref .",
    "@xcite , both with factorization plus chirally enhanced contributions and with the non - factorizable charming ( and gim ) penguin corrections .",
    "besides this , we will also give tables with the relevant @xmath3s , both in the factorization approximation with chirally enhanced terms and with the charming ( and gim ) penguin corrections included .",
    "we end this section with some remarks . in our approach , we have first checked that , within factorization and the sm , it is impossible to fit the experimental @xmath3s .",
    "the @xmath2 terms , that we are then forced to include in order to reproduce the experimental results , are non - perturbative quantities , infrared divergent in perturbation theory , on which we do not have any knowledge _ a priori_. for this reason we decided to fit them on the data .",
    "the experimental numbers are nicely reproduced and the corrections to factorization are well consistent with the expected size ( i.e. @xmath35 is of @xmath51 with respect to the leading contributions ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the subleading power corrections are varied in predefined intervals and the change in the predicted @xmath3s is interpreted as uncertainty on the factorized amplitudes . in our opinion",
    "the uncertanties on factorization are only those coming from the ckm matrix elements or the form factors , etc .",
    "the @xmath2 terms instead are really contributions beyond factorization : if they are necessary to reproduce the data then it is not possible to make model independent predictions .",
    "this would remain true even if we knew without any uncertainty the hadronic parameters entering at the lowest order of the @xmath2 expansion  s are dominated by the @xmath2 corrections . ] .",
    "thus we are in the bermuda triangle : i ) without the @xmath76 and @xmath77 terms , that is within qcd factorization , we can not reproduce the data ; ii ) the inclusion of the computable subset of @xmath77 terms only is inconsistent since there is no reason to exclude the other non - perturbative non - computable contributions of the same order . in any case",
    ", we will show that , by using all the available experimental information , also this case is very difficult to reconcile with the data ; iii ) the complete set of @xmath77 corrections leads us beyond factorization and the results are model dependent .",
    "indeed there is no proof that the one - loop finite chirally enhanced terms remain infrared finite at higher orders in @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , if the corrections of @xmath78 are phenomenologicaly important , it is difficult to understand why , at the same level of numerical accuracy , other non - chirally enhanced non - perturbative @xmath2 terms should not also be taken into account .",
    "the sad conclusion is that the very nice theory of qcd factorization developed in  @xcite is insufficient to fit the data because power corrections , which are model dependent , are important in @xmath79 and @xmath80 decays .",
    "finally , model dependence does not implies that we are unable to make any prediction . if the assumptions made in our approach are reasonable  . ] , by fitting @xmath81 to the data and with the increasing experimental precision we may hope to extract also the value of @xmath4 or to constrain @xmath82",
    "in this section we present our analysis and a detailed comparison with the results of ref .  @xcite . in order to obtain our results we used the likelihood method as in  @xcite .",
    "the input parameters , given in table  [ tab : inputs ] , are also the same but for a few differences :    * we added the @xmath56 corrections to the coefficients of the penguin and electropenguin operators computed in  @xcite , which appeared after the completion of  @xcite . in this respect the criticisms of ref .",
    "@xcite do not apply to the present analysis .",
    "we will see below that , even including these new ingredients , the main physics conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite are confirmed . * as for the matrix elements of @xmath63 , we include the `` computable '' factorizable chirally enhanced terms in the definition of @xmath81 , which in this way contains all the possible cabibbo enhanced , model - dependent corrections of @xmath51 . in practice this corresponds to fit @xmath67 as in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath83 .",
    "there is no substantial difference between the old choice and the new one , since the contribution of the chirally enhanced terms and of @xmath31 have exactly the same quantum numbers . *",
    "although this is a minor source of uncertainty we also allow a variation of the renormalization scale and of the parameters of the hadronic wave functions .",
    "we have also verified that by using the inputs of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain essentially the same results , and hence arrive to the same physics conclusions .    in this section",
    "we present :    1 .   a brief discussion of the results obtained in qcd factorization , namely with all the terms of @xmath51 set to zero .",
    "the results obtained in our approach by fitting @xmath35 and using @xmath4 as determined from the unitary triangle analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath84 on the basis of this study we predict the @xmath8@xmath85 asymmetries of the @xmath3s , such as @xmath86 3 .",
    "the results obtained by letting @xmath4 free and a comparison of our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we compare the model independent results obtained with qcd factorization , namely including only the terms which survive when @xmath87 , with the experimental data . in this case",
    "there is still a residual model dependence due to our ignorance of the semileptonic form factors @xmath59 and , at order @xmath14 , to the ignorance of the hadron wave functions .",
    "we vary the semileptonic form factors with flat p.d.f . in the intervals given in table [ tab : inputs ] and the parameters of the hadron wave functions in the intervals given in table 2 of ref .",
    "we also vary the renormalization scale between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , see table 1 of  @xcite .",
    "the data show a generalized disagreement with the qcd factorization predictions .",
    "in particular the allowed region in the @xmath90@xmath91 plane and the value of @xmath4 do not have any overlap with the corresponding ones from the unitarity triangle analysis  @xcite .",
    "this remains true even if we double the uncertainty on @xmath92 .",
    "we conclude that qcd factorization can not be reconciled with data .",
    ".input values used in the numerical analysis .",
    "the form factors are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite , the ckm parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite and the brs correspond to our average of cleo , babar and belle results @xcite .",
    "all the @xmath3s are given in units of @xmath93 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now discuss the effect of @xmath94 on the final results .",
    "the addition of these parameters , in the range proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , leaves the situation substantially unaltered as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lorolastloro ] .",
    "this holds true also for the @xmath3s , which are given in table  [ tab : one ] with the label bbns .",
    "the reason is that on the one hand @xmath71 and @xmath70 do not have the same quantum numbers , and hence effects , of charming penguins , on the other the range chosen _ a priori _ , on the basis on one - loop perturbation theory , is not large enough to improve the agreement with the measured @xmath3s ( it essentially increases the uncertainty on the predictions ) .",
    "of course by choosing a low value of the strange quark mass and of @xmath95 ( without using the experimental information coming from its measurements ) , a large value of @xmath96 and a small value for @xmath97 etc .",
    "it is still possible to find some point in parameter space where the @xmath98 is good .",
    "that this can be used to fit @xmath4 and test the sm is hard to believe though .    the situation would be different if @xmath94 are let free to vary and fitted to the data .",
    "we have done this exercise and found that the preferred value of @xmath99 is much larger than the values allowed in the interval chosen in @xcite , whereas @xmath100 is not determined by the fit .",
    "we conclude that since @xmath71 and @xmath70 are infrared divergent quantities , the value of which can not be predicted , and since without the inclusion of non - perturbative contributions of @xmath51 is not possible to reproduce the experimental data , we are bound to use model dependent assumptions in the analysis of non - leptonic @xmath1 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "we have analyzed the predictions of qcd factorization for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . even taking into account the uncertainties of the input parameters , we find that qcd factorization is unable to reproduce the observed @xmath3s .",
    "the introduction of charming and gim penguins  @xcite allows to reconcile the theoretical predictions with the data . instead of varying the non - perturbative phenomenological parameters in preassigned ranges ,",
    "we prefer to try to fit them on the data . with the present theoretical and experimental accuracy",
    ", we find that it is still not possible to determine the cp violation angle @xmath4 .",
    "the situation is expected to improve in the near future with more accurate experimental measurements of the relevant @xmath3s .",
    "contrary to factorization , we predict large asymmetries for several of the particle ",
    "antiparticle @xmath3s , in particular @xmath101 , @xmath102 and , possibly , @xmath103 .",
    "this opens new perspectives for the study of cp violation in @xmath8 systems .",
