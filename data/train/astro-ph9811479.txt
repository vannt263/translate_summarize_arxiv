    "the planet ( probing lensing anomalies network ) collaboration uses a longitudinally - distributed network of telescopes in the southern hemisphere to perform densely - sampled , precise photometric monitoring of galactic microlensing events with the express goal of searching for anomalies , especially those that may betray the presence of extrasolar planets ( @xcite ) orbiting the lenses .",
    "multiple lenses , such as lensing binary stars or planetary systems , generate measurably anomalous light curves if the background source comes close to a caustic generated by the lens ; direct transits of a caustic can cause sudden and dramatic changes ( amplification @xmath6 10 on time scales of hours ) in the apparent brightness of the source .",
    "three such microlensing events were monitored by planet in its 1997 galactic bulge observing season ; here we describe our results for one of these , .",
    "although typical subgiants and giants in the galactic bulge have radii that subtend only @xmath71@xmath810  microarcseconds ( @xmath9as ) , the dramatic change in magnification in the vicinity of caustics can selectively magnify the spatial structure of the source star by huge factors , momentarily acting as a very high - resolution , large - aperture telescope trained on the background source .",
    "these relatively rare but spectacular lensing events are particularly important because they can yield otherwise unobtainable information about the lens and source .    generally speaking ,",
    "the only physical parameter that can be deduced from non - anomalous microlensing light curves is the characteristic time scale @xmath10 of the event , defined as the time required for the lens to move an angular distance across the observer s sight line to the source equal to the angular einstein radius @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total mass of the lens and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote the observer - lens , observer - source and lens - source linear distances , respectively .    in caustic crossing events ,",
    "photometric monitoring can allow more information to be obtained , including the relative proper motion @xmath9 of the lens - source system and  if the coverage is complete over the caustic  the surface brightness profile of the source star . during a caustic transit , the radial surface brightness profile , or limb - darkening , of the source",
    "influences the shape of the resulting light curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "photometric data of sufficient precision and temporal resolution can thus be inverted to deduce the limb - darkening profile of source stars as distant as the galactic bulge ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , including possible chromatic effects induced by differential limb - darkening at different wavelengths ( @xcite , 1995b ; @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopic monitoring with very large aperture telescopes may reveal even more information , including detailed information about stellar atmospheric physics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and metallicity ( @xcite ) of the sources .",
    "one of the most important observational constraints on models of stellar atmospheres has come from limb - darkening measurements of the sun , a relatively cool dwarf .",
    "constraints on the atmospheres of other types of stars are more difficult to obtain . measurements of radial profiles , or more specifically , limb - darkening parameters , have been attempted for only a handful of stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "eclipsing binaries , lunar occultations and interferometry have been used to resolve and measure the surface structure of nearby stars .",
    "the classical method of using the light curves of eclipsing binaries has provided accurate limb - darkening measurements or consistency checks in only a few cases ( popper 1984 ; andersen 1991 ; ribas  1987 ) , but at least one suggests that a non - linear limb - darkening law is indicated ( milone , stagg & kurucz 1992 ) .",
    "direct hst imaging of the bright , nearby m2 supergiant betelgeuse has resulted in estimates for its limb - darkening and other surface irregularities ( @xcite ) .",
    "interferometric techniques also require very large , bright stars ( hanbury brown  1974 ; dyck  1996 ; mozurkewich  1991 ; mourard  1997 ) , where surface structure is often due to spotting or dust envelopes rather than limb - darkening ( roddier & roddier 1985 ; wilson  1992 ) .",
    "although the interferometric signal is often incompatible with a uniform stellar disk , with the exception of extreme supergiants like betelgeuse ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , theoretical limb - darkening laws are adopted in order to arrive at better stellar radius determinations ( quirrenbach  1996 ; hajian  1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the technique holds promise for limb - darkening determinations as it begins to probe into the normal k giant regime ( @xcite ) .",
    "lunar occultations have been used to resolve stellar surface structure ( bogdanov & cherepashchuk 1984 , 1990 , 1991 ; richichi & lisi 1990 ; di  giacomo  1991 ) , but the dust associated with these supergiants complicates limb - darkening estimates here as well ( richichi  1991 , 1995 ) and surface profiles from theory are generally assumed so as to derive better diameters ( white & feierman 1987 ; richichi  1998 ) .",
    "the precision of microlensing in mapping stellar surface brightness profiles can thus make an important contribution to stellar atmospheric theory by providing limb - darkening and spectral information on stars too faint or too small to be studied by traditional methods .",
    "we report here our precise and temporally dense photometric observations of the macho - detected microlensing event 97-blg-28 , which when combined with our spectral typing and modeling have produced the first limb - darkening measurement via microlensing , and the first resolution of surface structure in a star so distant ( @xmath78  kpc ) .",
    "the galactic bulge microlensing event  was alerted by the macho collaboration on 29 may 1997 as a normal event expected to reach peak brightness near 10 june 1997 .",
    "planet began to observe the event directly after the initial alert as part of its normal monitoring program . within hours of the anomalously rapid increase in its brightness on 14 june 1997 , planetplanet ] and macho / gman",
    "independently issued electronic alerts announcing  as a likely caustic - crossing binary event .",
    "dense photometric planet monitoring continued over the peak of the light curve and for about 6 weeks thereafter , with additional data taken near the baseline magnitude in october 1997 and at the beginning of the 1998 season .",
    "a pre - caustic spectrum was taken on 31 may 1997 .",
    "three planet telescopes participated in the monitoring : the dutch / eso 0.92  m at la  silla , chile , the saao  1 m at sutherland , south africa , and the canopus  1 m near hobart , tasmania .",
    "the full planet dataset consists of 686 data points taken in 1997 ( 508 i - band : 247 la  silla , 128 saao , 133 tasmania ; 178 v - band : 98 la  silla , 38 saao , 42 tasmania ) and another 10 data points ( 5 i - band ; 5 v - band ) collected at the saao  1 m in march and april of 1998 . for details concerning the telescopes , detectors , and field sizes , refer to albrow  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the data were reduced with  ( @xcite ) using fixed position catalogs and four stars in the field chosen to be stable , moderately bright and relatively uncrowded as a relative flux standard ( @xcite ) .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were calibrated against contemporaneous observations of johnson - cousins , ubv(ri)c e - region standards ( menzies  1989 ) made at saao at the beginning of the 1998 season . as we describe in  3.1 , individual zero points for photometry at different planet sites allow us to refer all our multi - site data to the saao natural system , and thus to the standard system .",
    "measurements taken in 1998 and calibrated in the manner described above produced baseline magnitudes of the source star of johnson @xmath17 and cousins @xmath18 , accurate to 0.05  mag .",
    "whenever the event was fainter than @xmath19 , measurements derived from frames with poor image quality ( fwhm @xmath20 ) were clearly and systematically fainter than those from moderate to high quality images , and had a scatter that was substantially larger than the -reported error bars . in order to avoid systematically biasing our modeling , measurements with @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) and fwhm@xmath23 were excluded from the fitting procedure to extract lens and source parameters .",
    "in addition , one particularly poor image that produced measurements that deviated by 0.75  mag for constant stars as bright as @xmath24 was also excluded .",
    "this high - quality subset of our dataplanet ] consists of 586 data points ( 431 i - band : 247 la  silla , 130 saao , 54 tasmania ; 155 v - band : 98 la  silla , 41 saao , 16 tasmania ) and is displayed in fig .  1 .      on 31 may 1997 , prior to the anomalous peak of , red and blue spectra were taken of the source star by dr .",

    "the camera has both imaging and spectroscopic capabilities , and can hold 5 gratings simultaneously so that multiple spectral resolutions and bandpasses can be easily configured .",
    "a direct image of the field was first obtained with an exposure of 10  sec .",

    "no filter was used in order to minimize any possible offset between the slit and the direct image .",
    "a slit of 15 width was used for all the observations , and was placed in the correct parallactic angle .",
    "observations were conducted through thin cirrus clouds in seeing of @xmath710 .",
    "the blue spectrum was obtained at 04:40 ut using the b150 grating , which covers 3900 - 5300  , with a resolution of about 5 .",
    "the red spectrum was obtained at 05:25 ut using the o150 grating , which covers the wavelength range 5200 - 6800  , with the same resolution .",
    "the exposure time in both cases was 2400 sec .",
    "the image processing software packages midas and iraf were used to reduce the spectral data .",
    "after bias subtraction , the frames were flat - field corrected with an average of 5 flat - field images of the dome illuminated with a tungsten lamp . to ensure good sky subtraction , sky levels",
    "were determined from both sides of the spectrum .",

    "obvious cosmic rays have been removed .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath28 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of about 260  at the strong nai absorption feature near 5890 .",
    "the heliocentric correction for the velocities is 9.5 , which is negligible compared to the resolution of the spectrum .",
    "comparison of the flux - calibrated spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 with spectral synthesis codes ( fitgrid and specfit tasks of iraf ) yields the best match to a k2iii star of solar metallicity , effective temperature @xmath29k and surface gravity @xmath30 .",
    "the strong nai line is not typical of a star of this type , but the equivalent width of the line is entirely consistent with interstellar absorption along this long sight line to the bulge source star at celestial ( j2000 ) coordinates @xmath3118@xmath3200@xmath3333.8@xmath34 and @xmath352801@xmath2710@xmath36 , corresponding to galactic @xmath37  and @xmath38 .",
    "some ambiguity remains in the spectral solution depending on the extinction to the source , but the best fit for the reddening of the spectrum and the radius of the source are consistent with that derived from an independent analysis of the color - magnitude diagram of field , described below .",
    "the radius of the source star was determined by considering its position in the @xmath39 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) relative to red clump ( rc ) stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "our cmd was derived from observations taken at the saao  1 m , calibrated by reference to e - region standard star baseline data in 1998 .",
    "the absolute @xmath1 magnitude of the peak of the rc luminosity function in the bulge has been determined to be @xmath40  0.03 ( stanek & garnavich 1998 ; paczyski & stanek 1998 ) .",
    "we have fitted the @xmath1-magnitude distribution of the rc stars in our sample using the same function as stanek & garnavich ( 1998 ) . based on the distribution of stars in cmd",
    ", we find that there is an equal probability that the  source star is in the rc or on the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "possible values for the average field reddening were determined by fitting the observed rgb to the bertelli  ( 1994 ) isochrones for ages of 3.1 and 10 gyr and metallicities [ fe / h ] = @xmath410.4 , 0 , + 0.4 , resulting in the range of reddening values @xmath42 .",
    "stanek s ( 1998 ) reddening map of the galactic plane indicates a gradient of @xmath7 0.2 mag across the @xmath43  arcmin saao field ; interpolation at the position of the microlensing event gives @xmath44 , corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "for each value of plausible reddening , we used the known rc absolute magnitude to rescale our cmd , treating the distance modulus as a free parameter . for each isochrone fit to the rgb for a given age and metallicity ,",
    "other isochrones were also plotted to allow for the possibility that the source star may differ in age or metallicity from the rgb mean . in all cases",
    "for which a reasonable fit ( @xmath46  mag ) was found for the source being on the rgb or in the rc , the source radius was calculated from the appropriate isochrone .",
    "reasonable consistency emerged among the 25 resulting radius values , with all in the range @xmath47 , and a mean value of @xmath48 ( 1-@xmath49 uncertainty ) .",
    "this result will be used together with the modeling in  [ params ] to estimate the relative proper motion of the lens with respect to the source .    in fig .  3",
    ", we show our cmd for the field of , dereddened with our fitted value of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) over the whole of the field .",
    "the position of the observed ( blended ) source star at baseline is shown as the filled circle in fig .  3 , where it is assumed that the source suffers the same reddening as the field mean .",
    "our derived dereddened color of @xmath52 from cmd considerations is in excellent agreement with the @xmath53 ( bessell 1990 ) expected for our k2 giant spectral typing of this source .",
    "the abrupt change of slope in the light curve near hjd - 2449719 = 896.4 evident in fig .",
    "4 suggests that the source star has crossed the caustic structure of a binary lens .",
    "the single nearly - symmetric finite peak near hjd - 2449719 = 895.6 further suggests that the extent of the source is resolved by the observations and that the source passed behind an isolated cusp of the caustic geometry on a nearly perpendicular trajectory .",
    "this lensing geometry is indeed borne out by our modeling of the light curve for , as can be seen in fig .",
    "5 . to reproduce the features in the observed light curve it was necessary to include lens binarity , source blending , extended source size , and source limb - darkening in this model . together with allowances for possible photometric offsets between the 3 observing sites in both bands",
    ", this requires a total of 19 fit parameters , as we now explain .",
    "we label each subset of the data by observing site and filter .",
    "let @xmath54 denote the number of such data subsets .",
    "a model with a point - source and point - lens will require @xmath55 parameters : @xmath56 , the ( einstein ) time required for the lens to move an angular distance @xmath11 ( eq .",
    "1 ) ; @xmath57 , the smallest lens - source angular separation in units of @xmath11 ; @xmath58 , the time at which this smallest separation occurs ; and the set of @xmath54 @xmath59 , the multi - site , multi - band baseline magnitudes .",
    "individual baselines are required for each site because although all data of a given band are referred to the same secondary field standards , we often find that small discrepancies remain in our multi - site photometry that appear to be related to differences in detector resolution and average seeing conditions ( albrow 1998 ) .",
    "parametrization of a binary lens composed of two objects with mass @xmath60 and @xmath61 requires an additional 3 parameters : @xmath62 , the angular binary separation in units of @xmath11 ; @xmath63 , the binary mass ratio ; and @xmath64 , the angle between the line from @xmath61 to @xmath60 and the direction of source proper motion ( relative to the lens ) .",
    "these parameters and the direction of proper motion are chosen so that @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and the midpoint of the lens system is on the right hand side of the moving source as viewed by the observer . for a binary system , the smallest angular separation @xmath57 between lens and source now refers to the midpoint of the lens system , and the angular einstein radius @xmath11 refers to the total mass @xmath68 .",
    "the baseline magnitudes include all light , including any that may be due to any unresolved , non - lensed light that may be confused with source light in the observations .",
    "to account for the possibility of such photometric confusion , blending parameters @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) must be added for each of the observed @xmath71 wave bands to characterize the fraction of the total light contributed by the source alone at baseline .",
    "no blending in wave bands @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "the extended size of the source is characterized by an additional parameter @xmath74 , the angular radius of the source in units of the einstein radius .",
    "finally , the light intensity profile of the source may be limb - darkened rather than uniform over the stellar disk .",
    "we adopt a limb - darkening law of the form @xmath75\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight .",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 are wavelength dependent , requiring an additional @xmath79 parameters .",
    "the inclusion of all these effects thus requires @xmath80 fit parameters . for the 3 planet sites , each observing  in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , thus necessitating 19 parameters in the full model .",
    "we fit three different extended - source binary - lens models , with either a uniform source or a 1- or 2-parameter limb - darkened source , to the combined , high - quality dataset of 586 ccd frames (  2.1 ) using the formal uncertainties reported by dophot .",
    "details of calculating the light curves for such models can be found in the work of dominik ( 1998 ) .",
    "the multi - site , multi - band baselines were allowed to vary independently in the fitting process ; this photometric alignment resulted in relative multi - site offsets of @xmath83mag in our best model .    in general , it is a difficult task to find a minimum in high - dimensional parameter space .",
    "however , in this case , nearly optimal values for some parameters could be found by first searching in lower - dimensional subspaces .",
    "the six baselines could be estimated from the latest data points and then fitted with a point - lens model together with the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath10 and the two blending parameters , using the data points outside the peak region .",
    "we thus began fitting the binary - lens extended - source models only after we had good guesses for 11 of the parameters .",
    "parameters from the uniform source fit then provided us with good initial estimates for a total of 15 parameters , requiring only 2 or 4 additional parameters when including limb - darkening .    our best fit was achieved for a 2-parameter limb - darkening model ( ld2 ) , and yielded a @xmath84 of 1913 for the 567 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) .",
    "this model is displayed in the left panels of fig .  4 and its fit parameters are listed in table  [ fpartab ] .",
    "if the ld2 model is indeed the best representation of the data , then the reduced @xmath85 is an indication that the  uncertainties are on average underestimated by a factor @xmath71.8 , consistent with our previous experience ( @xcite ) .    the corresponding source trajectory and caustic structure for the ld2 model shown in fig .",
    "5 illustrate that the cusp caustic of the binary lens just sweeps over the limb of the extended source , the first clear observation of such a cusp crossing .",
    "such a crossing differentially magnifies different portions of the source as a function of time ( top panel , fig .",
    "6 ) . because the central ring crosses almost directly over the cusp , it experiences the greatest magnification .",
    "the fraction of light contributed by concentric rings ( of equal area ) on the stellar disk therefore also varies during the anomaly ( bottom panel , fig .  6 ) , allowing the surface profile , and thus limb - darkening , of the source to be deduced . for the specific geometry of",
    ", the contrast between the fraction of light contributed by the inner and outermost of 10 equal - area rings is a factor @xmath73 during the cusp crossing .",
    "the planet dataset is well - sampled everywhere during the cusp crossing except in the 12-hour period near @xmath86 .",
    "in addition to our best fitting model with square root limb - darkening coefficients ( ld2 ) , table  [ fpartab ] also lists the parameters for two other models : a fit with a linear , 1-parameter , limb - darkening law ( ld1 ) , which yields @xmath84 of 1930 for 569 d.o.f . , and a fit with a uniformly bright source ( ub ) , which yields @xmath84 of 3255 for 571 d.o.f . under the assumption that our 2-parameter limb - darkening model is indeed the best representation of the data ,",
    "the large @xmath87 compared to the number of degrees of freedom must be attributed to a misestimation of the experimental uncertainties .",
    "this is not unexpected since our previous experience in crowded fields indicates that   formal uncertainties are smaller than the true scatter in the photometry of constant stars by an amount that depends on the crowding of the star ( albrow  1998 ) . in order to assess conservatively the differences in @xmath84 between models , therefore , we first rescale the formal  uncertainties by @xmath88 , which is tantamount to the assumption that the ld2 model is perfect and would yield a true @xmath89 if the `` true '' photometric uncertainties were known .",
    "the rescaling is global , preserving the relative uncertainty between points , and conservative , allowing for the possibility that part of the @xmath90 between models can be due to the underestimation of photometric uncertainties by .",
    "the rescaled @xmath84 of the ld1 and ub models are thus 572 and 965 , respectively .",
    "the significance of the limb - darkened ld1 and ld2 models over the uniform brightness ub model is enormous : using the rescaled uncertainties , @xmath91 between the ld1 and ub models , and @xmath92 between ld2 and ub .",
    "this precipitous drop in @xmath84 with the addition of the limb - darkening parameters leaves no doubt that limb - darkening has been detected to an exceedingly high degree of confidence in the planet photometry of this event .",
    "the enlargements of the light curve in fig .  4",
    "show how precisely the 2-parameter limb - darkening model ( ld2 ) reproduces the detail in the cusp and limb regions in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . on the right of the same figure",
    ", these sections of the light curve are overplotted with the uniform source model ( ub ) .",
    "the multi - site photometry is aligned automatically by the fitting procedure ; this photometric alignment is somewhat different for the two models .",
    "even given the freedom to photometrically realign the data from different sites relative to one another , the ub model fails to fit the shape of the convexity at peak and the gentle slope of the curve as the limb of the star egresses .",
    "the failure of the uniformly bright model to reproduce the structure in the light curve during the limb crossing can be seen most dramatically in fig .  7 , where the residuals of the ld2 and ub models are shown .",
    "if the smaller normalized @xmath84 of the ld2 model compared to the ld1 models is not physically significant , but instead only due to the freedom of adjusting the additional @xmath78 parameters , we would expect @xmath93 to be distributed as @xmath87 with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the number of additional parameters ( press  1986 , chapter 14 ) .",
    "the significance of the ld2 model over the ld1 model is thus determined by the 8.2% probability of obtaining by chance a @xmath94 improvement with two additional degrees of freedom , corresponding to a marginal 1.7@xmath49 detection of a surface profile that deviates from the 1-parameter limb - darkening law in both bands .",
    "this marginal improvement indicates that the inclusion of additional profile fitting parameters beyond those included in the ld2 model is unlikely to result in a significantly better fit ; the ld2 model contains the all the information that we are able to pull from this dataset about the source profile .",
    "the large difference in @xmath93 between the limb - darkened and uniform bright models is not due solely to the cusp - crossing portions of the light curve .",
    "since the model parameters are correlated , even those parameters unrelated to the source profile differ between the uniform source model and the limb - darkened models , as inspection of table  [ fpartab ] indicates .",
    "interestingly , the limb - darkened models always required a smaller photometric offset between sites in both bands .",
    "the uniform brightness model apparently attempted to match the observed shape of the light curve at the limb by adjusting the photometric offsets slightly , hindering the @xmath87 performance of the ub model elsewhere in the light curve .",
    "the clear signature of limb - darkening is revealed only with high precision data during the few hours when the limb of the star is grazing the caustic ; high - quality data over the whole of the light curve is required , however , to obtain a full and accurate microlensing solution .",
    "another test of the reliability of our limb - darkening parameters is provided by fits we performed on the full dataset , including the poorer quality frames , but now estimating the photometric uncertainties empirically so that the size of the error bar scales with the overall frame quality . specifically , we set the uncertainty of the event magnitude on a given frame equal to the average deviation of all similarly - bright constant stars from their average magnitude .",
    "we also eliminated the baseline points taken in 1998 in order to test whether the availability of a long temporal baseline was important to our conclusions about limb - darkening . the resulting @xmath95 and fit parameters",
    "are given in the last three columns of table  [ fpartab ] for the three source models .",
    "the value of @xmath95 now appears to be too small primarily due to the fact that  is less crowded than a typical star of its brightness , so that the frame quality undercertainties are overestimates of its true photometric scatter .",
    "what is important to note is that the uniformly bright source is again strongly ruled out and that all model parameters are left almost entirely unaffected by this alternate selection and treatment of the data , demonstrating the model s robustness .",
    "both of the simpler models are special cases of the ld2 family of models : the ld1 model requires the limb - darkening parameter @xmath96 in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while the ub model sets @xmath97 in both bands .",
    "this means that our ld1 and ub models , which correspond to points on the @xmath87 hypersurface over restricted portions of the ld2 parameter space , also correspond to points on the full ld2 @xmath87 hypersurface .",
    "the probability of obtaining a renormalized @xmath87 that is larger than that of the ld1 solution is @xmath98 for both the  and frame quality methods of estimating relative photometric uncertainties ; the probability of obtaining a renormalized @xmath87 larger than that of the ub is negligibly small .",
    "we conclude that the 2-parameter limb - darkening model is clearly superior to the uniform source model and marginally superior to the 1-parameter limb - darkening model .",
    "we now adopt it as our best model and use it to derive the physical parameters for the lens and the surface brightness profile of the source , which we now compare to expectations from stellar atmosphere models .      as we discussed in  [ data ]",
    ", both spectroscopic and photometric considerations indicate that the source star of  is a k giant in the galactic bulge , with k2iii being the most probable typing .",
    "the fits to our photometric data discussed in  [ model ] yield the limb - darkening coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 bands separately .",
    "the corresponding surface brightness profiles for the source star , normalized so as to give a total flux equal to unity , are shown in fig .  8 for our ld2 model of the high - quality photometric dataset using  estimates for the relative photometric uncertainties .",
    "the surface brightness profiles derived from modeling the full dataset with empirical `` frame quality '' error bars produces nearly identical profiles ( see coefficients in table  1 ) .",
    "our results clearly indicate that , as expected , this giant is more limb - darkened in @xmath2 than in @xmath1 .    also shown in fig .",
    "8 are predictions from stellar atmospheric models for k0 and k5 giants from two different groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) both using the square - root limb - darkening law of eq .  2 .",
    "we have interpolated between the values given by these authors , labeling as k0 a star with effective temperature @xmath99k and surface gravity @xmath100 , and as k5 a giant @xmath101k and surface gravity @xmath102 , in good agreement with standard convention ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cooler , later type k5 giants are more limb - darkened than their warmer k0 cousins .",
    "although the theoretical @xmath1 profiles of both groups are nearly identical , the @xmath2 profiles of diaz - cordoves , claret & gimenez ( 1995 ) are slightly more limb - darkened than those of van  hamme ( 1993 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles derived from our photometric data modeled with the limb - darkening law of eq .",
    "2 are in excellent agreement with these predictions from atmospheric models .",

    "8 indicates that the source star of   may be slightly more limb - darkened in the @xmath1 band than current models predict for its spectral type , this conclusion should be treated with considerable caution given the uncertainties in the light curve modeling , spectral typing , and the rather ad hoc nature of the fitting function for the surface brightness profile .",
    "our results for  represent the first time that limb - darkening coefficients have been measured for a microlensing source .",
    "limb - darkening was indicated but not measured by macho observations of the high - amplitude single - lens event macho  95-blg-30 ; fixing limb - darkening coefficients to agree with stellar atmosphere models did produce a fit to the data that was marginally better ( normalized @xmath103 ) than uniform disk models ( @xcite ) .",
    "our limb - darkening measurement for  is among only a very few determinations for normal giants , and respresents the first surface brightness profile for any star as distant as the galactic bulge .",
    "the ability of planet photometry to yield measurements of limb - darkening coefficients in  is due to the overall characterization of the complete light curve combined with excellent temporal coverage ( sampling times @xmath104 minutes ) over peak and limb caustic egress regions .",
    "in caustic crossing events , dense photometric monitoring allows not only the determination of @xmath10 , the time required for the lens to travel an angular distance @xmath11 , but also a second time scale : the time @xmath105 required to travel the angular source radius @xmath106 . for uniform rectilinear motion ,",
    "the ratio @xmath107 directly yields the angular size of the source in units of the einstein ring , @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath106 can be estimated by other means (  photometric or spectroscopic typing ) , both @xmath11 and the relative lens - source proper motion @xmath108 can thus be determined , yielding important information on lens kinematics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to date ,",
    "proper motions derived from this technique have been published for only two binary events in the magellanic clouds , macho  lmc-09 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and macho  98-smc-01 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and one single - lens ( point - caustic ) event macho  95-blg-30 in the galactic bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relative proper motion can be written in terms of the model parameters @xmath10 and @xmath109 , and the physical source size @xmath110 and distance @xmath111 as : @xmath112 which for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , as indicated by the spectral typing of  2.3 , yield a relative proper motion @xmath115 this corresponds to a perpendicular velocity in the lens plane @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "the ( total ) mass of the lens is given by @xmath118 so that for a disk lens halfway to the galactic center ( @xmath119 ) , one obtains @xmath120 and total lens mass @xmath121 , whereas a lens embedded in the bulge with @xmath122 yields @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "either value is consistent with galactic kinematics .",
    "assuming a source distance @xmath125kpc and source radius in the range @xmath126 (  2.3 ) , the top panel of fig .",
    "9 gives the mass of the individual lensing components as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "since the binary mass ratio is @xmath128 , it is quite likely that the lighter of the lens objects has the mass of an m dwarf or less ; if the lens lies in the galactic disk with @xmath129 , at least the smaller of the binary components is a brown dwarf . if , on the other hand , the lensing binary resides in the bulge @xmath130 , the masses of its components would be consistent with that of a typical lower main - sequence binary with a projected separation @xmath131 between 1 and 2  au ( bottom panel , fig .",
    "disk lenses would have smaller separations .",
    "our model fits to  yield a fraction @xmath132 of blended ( non - lensed ) light that is larger in the @xmath2 than in the @xmath1 band , indicating that the blend star is very much bluer than the background source star ( table  1 ) .",
    "if the blend is due to a single star , it lies in an underpopulated portion of the cmd ( fig .",
    "3 ) , either because it is not at the mean field distance and has been improperly dereddened , or because it is in a short - lived phase of its evolution .",
    "a main sequence star with @xmath133 has @xmath134 , and thus is so intrinsically bright that it can not appear as the blend anywhere along the reddening vector of fig .  3 unless it lies substantially _ behind _ the bulge , where it is likely to have more reddening than the  field , not less .",
    "if , on the other hand , the blend star is somewhat in front of the bulge and experiences slightly less extinction , it could lie on the portion of the isochrone at @xmath135 that corresponds to the transition zone between planetary nebulae and white dwarfs .",
    "such an interpretation would be consistent , furthermore , with the blended light coming from the lens itself : a white dwarf mass of @xmath136 is consistent with the mass that the larger lens component ( @xmath60 ) would have at a distance @xmath137 , slightly in front of the bulge .",
    "this dense portion of the milky way is a likely region for microlenses and should have an extinction similar to ( but slightly less than ) that of the field mean ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "if this explanation is correct , then the smaller lensing component would have a mass just above the hydrogen - burning limit at @xmath138 .",
    "these conclusions are valid only if the blended light sensed by the light curve fitting is due to a single star , but any explanation requiring two stars to produce the color of the blend would be even more ad hoc .",
    "the temporal coverage of the bulge microlensing event  from three planet observing sites longitudinally distributed in the southern hemisphere has resulted in an excellent characterization of the light curve in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "the full data set consists of 513 photometric measurements in the @xmath1-band and 183 measurements in @xmath2 , with 586 of these being of very high quality . during a 30-hour period over the peak of the light curve , sampling times between @xmath139 and 30 minutes were continuously maintained from the three sites .",
    "less dense photometric monitoring over other portions of the light curve , combined with baseline measurements taken nearly a year later have resulted in the best - characterized microlensing light curve to date .",
    "our spectrum of , taken at moderate magnification , indicates that the source star is likely to be a highly reddened k2 giant of solar metallicity .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a comparison of the color - magnitude diagram of the field to theoretical isochrones .",
    "modeling of the planet photometric dataset for   clearly indicates that the disk of the resolved source is transited by the cusp of the central caustic generated by a binary lens with mass ratio @xmath3 and instantaneous separation , in units of the einstein ring radius , of @xmath4 . a source of uniform surface brightness",
    "is strongly ruled out by our data ; the derived square root limb - darkening coefficients in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands derived from the photometric data alone are in excellent agreement with expectations from stellar atmospheric models for k giants . under the assumption that the source star is a k2iii ,",
    "the models appear slightly more limb - darkened in @xmath1 than our measurements , but the difference may not be significant .",
    "all of the conclusions above are independent of the ( unknown ) lens - source distance ratio @xmath127 and ( rather well - constrained ) source distance @xmath111 and radius @xmath140 . assuming a source in the galactic bulge at @xmath141kpc of radius @xmath142 , as indicated by our spectral typing , the total mass of the binary and its projected separation can be determined .",
    "if the lens resides in the bulge , it is likely to be a lower main sequence binary with both components above the hydrogen burning limit and a projected separation between 1 and 2  au .",
    "if the lens resides in the disk with the lens - source distance ratio @xmath129 , the projected separation would be smaller and one or both of the components would have a mass in the brown dwarf regime . assuming the same source distance and radius , the relative lens - source proper motion derived from our modeling is @xmath5 or @xmath143as / day , consistent with the lens having disk or bulge kinematics .",
    "the uncertainty in the proper motion is dominated by the uncertainty in the source radius , not by the characterization of the microlensing light curve . if the unlensed , blended light indicated by our models is due to a single star , its color and magnitude suggest that it is a young white dwarf in the bulge .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the light coming from the lens itself : the larger lens component would have a typical white dwarf mass at a bulge distance of @xmath137 , in which case its companion would be a very faint late m dwarf .",
    "these results mark the first time that the surface structure of a source star has been measured via microlensing and the first limb - darkening determination of a star as distant as the galactic bulge by any technique .",
    "as the number of caustic - crossing events alerted in real time continues to rise , and the quality and frequency of photometric monitoring of microlensing light curves continues to improve , microlensing holds the promise of making a substantial contribution to the field of stellar atmospheres by determining the surface profiles of normal stars too faint or small to be easily measured by other techniques .",
