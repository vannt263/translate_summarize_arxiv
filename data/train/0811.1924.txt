    "we note that the assumed accumulation layer of 2  nm is a rough estimate .",
    "it has been reported that the accumulation layer depends on the doping level ( see , for example , ref .",
    "since the charge carrier density varies only on a small scale due to doping , as compared to the variation due to accumulation , we do not expect this effect to be high .",
    "furthermore , we accounted for additional free charge carriers , as we calculate a total free charge carrier density , which has its origin in doping _ and _ accumumulation , i.e. , the initial intrinsic and extrinsic charge carrier densities were added to get the entire free charge carrier density in the channel .",
    "the mobility @xmath21 charge carrier density plot ( figure [ fig : accdope ] ) indicates that accumulation of charges within the undoped nc - zno results in an electron mobility increase over one order of magnitude from 1.3@xmath110@xmath2  @xmath3v@xmath4s@xmath4to 1.5@xmath110@xmath6  @xmath3v@xmath4s@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with hossain @xmath9 @xmath10  @xcite who simulated grain boundary barrier modulation within zno fets and concluded that an increasing gate voltage leads to a barrier height lowering .",

    "the mobility of the nanocrystalline material consists of the contributions from the bulk of the crystallites and from the grain boundaries .",
    "if thermally activated hopping over the energy barriers between the crystallites is the dominant transport limiting factor in nc - zno ,  @xcite the potential barrier height @xmath43 can be quantitatively derived from temperature dependent mobility data using @xmath44 where the mobility prefactor @xmath45 with @xmath46 being temperature independent .",

    "however , a higher potential barrier of 95  mev and 113  mev , repectively , is present , which we ascribe to the influence of structural disorder .",

    "we discuss them in a context of charge carrier density variation superimposed by crystallite size modification and structural disorder .",
    "the xrd spectra show a significant decrease in the ( 002 ) peak height , which can be accounted for by the additional disorder and transistion to the amorphous phase , induced by the high percentage of dopants in the material .",
    "analyzations of the spectra with the debye - scherrer method indicate that the crystallite size decreases with increasing doping level , resulting in a higher grain boundary density .",
    "in contrast , the maximum particle size , as seen with sem , is increasing up to a doping level of 2  at@xmath0 .",
    "we note that the discrepancy between crystallite sizes estimated by the debye - scherrer method and the particle sizes seen in sem micrographs has been previously reported for sputtered zno : al layers  @xcite and for other nanocrystalline systems .",
    "@xcite the origin of this difference is attributed to particles , consisting of a few crystallographic domains , i.e. , crystallites . between those grains the grain barrier is being formed .",
    "one also has to keep in mind the possiblity , that the ordering within the first few nanometers of the material can be different from the bulk material .",
    "the charge carrier density in the nominally undoped samples , i.e. , denoted as 0  at@xmath0 doping level , is surprisingly high in our case . actually , considering the bulk energy gap around 3.3 ev ,  @xcite one would expect an undoped system to be insulating .",

    "we note that in some cases the opposite doping dependence on the charge carrier density can be observed in hall measurements  @xcite . there , a lowered @xmath25 at high doping levels was reported .",
    "this trend could not be confirmed by our measurements .    for low doping levels",
    ", the growing free charge carrier density leads to an increase in conductivity , whereas at high doping levels , the induced disorder lowers the mobility and thus counteracts the positive effect of a doping induced high carrier concentration on the conductivity .",

    "further extrinsic doping of the nc - zno with al leads to a decreasing electron mobility with increasing doping level , as shown in figure  [ fig : mucondfitn ] . at @xmath23=20",
    "v , we observe decreasing mobilities for increasing doping levels . here , the charge carrier mobility is thus proportional to the crystallite size ( see table  [ dbs ] ) .    in order to investigate the charge transport properties in more detail , we performed temperature dependent mobility measurements .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : mut0at ] for the nominally undoped sample , two different transport regimes are indicated by the changing slope of the temperature dependent electron mobility .",
    "this effect is well known for polycrystalline semiconductors ; the high temperature regime is usually assigned to thermionic emission over energy barriers at the grain boundaries , whereas at low temperature thermally assisted tunnelling  @xcite or variable range hopping between donor states within the crystallites  @xcite is dominant . the activation energy which we derived in the high temperature regime initially decreases with increasing doping level , with a minimum barrier height at 2  at@xmath0 . the sample with the highest doping shows an increase in the activation energy , as seen in figure  [ fig : deltae ] .",
    "the decreasing activation energy for increasing doping level up to 2  at@xmath0 is consistent with the above - mentioned doping induced barrier lowering .",
    "however , as the electron mobility in our systems mostly does not show the expected increase with lowered energy barrier , the charge transport is not limited by thermionic emission over the grain boundaries .",
    "note that high doping levels in crystalline systems also lead to a diminished temperature dependence due to the reduction of the mean free path within the crystallites .",
    "two possible scenarious concerning the decreasing charge carrier mobility due to the extrinsic doping , ( i ) intercrystallite scattering due to a higher density of grain boundaries , and ( ii ) scattering within the crystallites at the defects in the band gap , could both explain our experiments by a formation of additional scattering centers .",
    "we considered the first option following the approach of hossain et al .",
    "@xcite however , the increasing number of grain boundaries shows a lower influence on the mobility as compared to the lowered barrier height , which is why we discard this explanation : the calculated mobilities do not show the experimentally observed decrease with raised extrinsic doping level .",
    "the second scenario , scattering by disorder and impurities due to the high extrinsic doping levels and the sol  gel processing , becomes thus the most probable option governing the charge carrier mobility above 0.8  at@xmath0 doping .",
    "the microscopic origin of these additional trap states is unclear as of yet ; an ionic , electronic and/or structural origin of the scattering centers is possible .",
    "in contrast to the effect of extrinsic doping , the mobility steadily increased due to accumulation of charge carriers in the field effect transistor channel ( see figure  [ fig : accdope ] ) , whereas the trap density remained unchanged.the activation energy , shown in figure  [ fig : deltae ] , decreases correspondingly .",
    "thus , in the case of accumulation , where the density of scattering centers remains constant , the experimental evidence is in favour of carrier concentration induced barrier height lowering governing the charge transport properties .",
    "we synthesized al doped zinc oxide nanoparticles via a sol  gel route , resulting in average crystallite sizes between 20  nm to 7  nm corresponding to doping concentrations from 0  at@xmath0 to 10  at@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the synthesized nanocrystals possess the wurtzite structure as derived from xrd and sem studies .",
    "we investigated the charge transport by using field effect transistor structures on sio@xmath13 with au bottom contacts .",
    "the accumulation of charge carriers in thin films of undoped zinc oxide nanoparticles results in higher charge carrier mobilities .",
    "in contrast , despite the extrinsic al doping leading to an increasing charge carrier density as well , the mobility decreases at higher doping levels .",
    "this is attributed to the formation of additional trap states of ionic , electronic and/or structural origin acting as scattering centers .",
    "high doping levels lead to smaller potential barrier heights at the nanoparticle interfaces .",
    "the potential barrier height derived from temperature dependent measurements reaches its minimum at a doping concentration of 2  at@xmath0 .",

    "the maximum conductivity was achieved at the doping concentration of 0.8  at@xmath0 at room temperature .",
    "the interplay between charge carrier density , barrier height and grain boundary density leads to a lowering of the mobility with increasing doping level . to conclude",
    ", we demonstrate that the al doping of zinc oxide nanoparticles by a sol  gel process is adjustable and can be controlled , but it does not automatically lead to improved electric transport properties as it simultaneously generates structural disorder , thus increasing the scattering of charge carriers .",
