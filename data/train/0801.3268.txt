    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) are interacting binaries harbouring a neutron star ( ns ) or a black - hole ( bh ) which accretes matter from a low mass star .",
    "a subgroup , the so - called x - ray transients ( sxts ) , provide a unique opportunity to set dynamical constraints to the the masses of both nss and bhs because the spectrum of the companion dominates during the quiescent ( x - ray off ) states .",
    "in particular , we can empirically determine the mass function of the system which is usually expressed as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the orbital period , @xmath8 the semi - amplitude of the velocity curve of companion star , @xmath9 the mass of the compact object , @xmath10 is the orbital inclination of the systems and @xmath11 the mass ratio .",
    "therefore , it is possible to establish a secure lower limit to the mass of the compact object by only measuring @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "although this method has successfully been applied to @xmath12 bh x - ray binaries ( see @xcite for details ) , they only represent the peak of the ice - berg of a large population of @xmath13 stellar - mass bh present in our galaxy ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "most quiescent sxts are optically faint , with @xmath14 , and hence dynamical constraints are usually affected by large errors . setting new dynamical constraints and refining the existing mass solutions are the only ways to get new insights into the fundamental properties of stellar - mass bhs .",
    "+ gx 339 - 4 ( v821 ara ) was discovered by oso 7 in 1972 ( @xcite ) . since then , several x - ray outburst ( e. g. 4 in the last decade ) have been observed , and all the x - ray states have been detected in this system ( see @xcite for the intermediate state and @xcite for the very high state ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite detected a compact jet emission from this system , showing that it is a microquasar .",
    "gx 339 - 4 was early proposed as a bh candidate based on its x - ray properties ( @xcite ) but the spectral features of the companion star could not be detected even during x - ray off states ( @xcite ) , preventing a dynamical confirmation ( i. e. @xmath15 ) . only during the 2002 outburst @xcite reported the first detection of the donor star thanks to the discovery of niii / ciii bowen emission lines arising from the irradiated companion star .",
    "the lines are very sharp and swing with a velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath16=@xmath17 km s@xmath18 .",
    "these authors also reported an orbital period of @xmath19 days which was later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the combination of both , radial velocity of the companion and orbital period yields @xmath20 ( and hence @xmath21 ) , which represents the first dynamical proof for a bh in gx 339 - 4 . note that narrow high - excitation emission lines originating from the companion star have also been detected in many others lmxbs ( e.g. @xcite ) and demonstrate that this is a common feature in lmxbs with high x - ray activity ( i. e. steady systems and transients during outbursts ) .",
    "however , the niii / ciii emission lines are excited on the inner hemisphere of the donor star by the bowen mechanism / photoionization ( @xcite ) and only provides a lower limit ( @xmath16 ) to the true @xmath22-velocity of the donor . in @xcite",
    "we tackle this problem in a general approach by modeling the deviation between the reprocessed light - center and the center of mass of a roche lobe filling star ( the so - called k - correction ) including screening effects by a flared accretion disc . in this paper",
    "we compute the k - correction for gx 339 - 4 which provides a more restrictive lower limit to the mass of the bh in this binary . in sections [ companion ] and [ observations ]",
    "we discuss the nature of the companion star and show that all the known observables can be explained by an scenario in which a stripped - giant companion transfers mass onto a bh .",
    "we also apply this evolutionary model to xte j1550 - 564 which shows observational properties very similar to gx 339 - 4 .",
    "the stellar parameters of the companion in this system are in excellent agreement with a stripped - giant scenario .",
    "following mcm05 the relation between the radial velocity corresponding to the center of mass of the companion ( @xmath8 ) and the observed emission line velocity(@xmath16 ) can be expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a dimensionless factor which represents the displacement of the emission light - center from the center of mass of the companion in units of the orbital separation .",
    "the value of @xmath24 depends on how much area of the irradiated hemisphere of the donor is shadowed by the flared accretion disc .",
    "according to mcm05 , @xmath24 is constrained between @xmath25 where the left hand side of the equation represents the case when the emission line is formed in the inner lagrange point whereas the right hand side corresponds to the case where the emission arises from the irradiated point with maximum radial velocity .",
    "this point is located at the limb of the irradiated region and holds an opening angle @xmath26 above the plane of the binary .",
    "an analytical expression of @xmath27 as function of q is provided by paczynski s equation ( 1971 ) ,    @xmath28    it is clear from eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] that @xmath8 ( and hence @xmath29 ) increases with @xmath24 . from the lower limit to @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ limit ] , it is possible to establish a more restrictive lower limit to @xmath30 than the one provided by h03 @xmath29 ( i. e. @xmath21 ) . in fig . [ all ]",
    "we show the lower limit obtained for @xmath30 as function of @xmath31 ( thick solid line ) .",
    "furthermore , gx 339 - 4 does not show eclipses of the x - ray source which results in the following restriction to the orbital inclination ( @xmath10 ) :    @xmath32 .    by using these constraints in eq .",
    "[ mf ] we obtain a strict lower limit to @xmath30 as function of @xmath31 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ all ] as a thick solid line .",
    "the dotted line shows the lower limit to @xmath29 reported by h03 but including also the above constraint on @xmath10 and the dependence of @xmath29 with @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the difference between the solid and dotted lines gives the net effect of the k - correction in the lower limit of the bh mass .",
    "for instance , it rises the lower limit by @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "unfortunately there are no strong constraints on @xmath31 and hence a restriction to the companion mass are clearly needed in order to derive a lower limit to @xmath9 independently of @xmath31 .",
    "( thick solid line ) as function of the mass ratio ( q ) and the mass of the companion(@xmath38 ) .",
    "we find @xmath39 ( thick solid line ) and @xmath40 .",
    "the dotted line shows the same limit by considering only the value reported by h03 ( @xmath41 ) , the absence of x - ray eclipses and the dependence of @xmath29 with @xmath33 ( see eq .",
    "we also mark @xmath42 reported by h03 as the light , grey region.,width=302 ]",
    "in terms of lmxb evolution there are three possible cases in which stable mass transfer occurs .",
    "these three evolutive paths essentially depend on what time scale ( angular momentum loss or stellar evolution ) brings the companion into roche lobe contact first ( e. g. @xcite ) . in this picture , lmxbs with orbital periods around @xmath43 2 days descend from systems where the companion has evolved off the main sequence as a subgiant before angular momentum losses shrink the roche lobe enough to allow mass overflow .",
    "@xcite showed that the mean density ( @xmath44 ) of a roche lobe - filling companion star is determined solely by the binary period @xmath7 :    @xmath45 g @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the orbital period in hours . for gx 339 - 4 , with @xmath48 hours , we obtain @xmath49 g @xmath46 which according to @xcite would correspond to a b main sequence star with @xmath50 .",
    "this scenario does not fit with the gx 339 - 4 case since a b star would dominate the optical spectrum of the binary . on the other hand ,",
    "late - type giants have even lower mean densities than the companion in gx 339 - 4 .",
    "therefore , the companion star is probably a subgiant , as it was previously suggested by @xcite . +",
    "a subgiant is a low mass star which has evolved off the main sequence and posses a helium core which represents an approximate fraction @xmath51 of the total stellar mass ( see @xcite for details ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that all the stellar properties depend on the core mass ( @xmath52 ) instead of its total mass ( @xmath38 ) . in this scenario mass transfer",
    "is driven by the expansion of the hydrogen burning shell as consequence of the nuclear evolution .",
    "this so - called stripped - giant evolutionary model , which is valid for @xmath53 , has been applied by @xcite to the case of the bh lmxb v404 cyg with convincing results . using the orbital period of gx 339 - 4 ( @xmath54 d ) into the k93 s equations we obtain @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . according to k93 @xmath58",
    "is constrained between    @xmath59    where the right hand side condition comes from the schonberg - chandrasekhar limit .",
    ".stripped giant model for gx339 - 4 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the lmxb xte j1550 - 564 was discovered on 1998 by the all sky monitor ( asm ) onboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that this system harbours a bh with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these authors also classify the companion star in the range g8iv - k4iii with @xmath62 k and @xmath63 although a tentative measurement of the rotational broadening suggests @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital period is @xmath65 days ( o02 ) which is very similar to that of gx 339 - 4 .",
    "the stripped - giant model ( see above equations ) for this @xmath7 yields @xmath66 with @xmath67 k , which is highly consistent with the observations . in table",
    "[ j1550 ] we compare the observed properties of the companion in xte j1550 - 564 with those obtained through the stripped - giant model and the parameters are in excellent agreement .",
    "+ since its discovery in 1998 ,",
    "xte j1550 - 564 has undergone two more x - ray outbursts suggesting a mass transfer rate close to @xmath68 .",
    "o02 estimate @xmath69 yr@xmath18 which yields @xmath70 . during the 1998 outburst",
    ", @xcite measured a maximum x - ray flux @xmath71 erg s@xmath18 @xmath72 which results in @xmath73 erg s@xmath18 ( @xmath74 kpc ; o02 ) and @xmath75 yr@xmath18 ( eq [ m1p ] ) . by combining the observational constraints to @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "we obtain a predicted duty cycle in the range @xmath78 .",
    "as expected , these values are larger that those typical of classical transients ( e. g. v404 cyg ) which have longer outburst recurrence times .",
    "we get to reproduce these values by considering stripped - giant companions with @xmath79 , for which we predict @xmath80 in agreement with the observations .",
    "we want to note that xte j1550 - 564 is also interesting because is one of only four sxts for which the very high x - ray state has been observed ( e. g. @xcite ; gx 339 - 4 is one of the other three ) .",
    "moreover @xcite observed relativistic plasma ejections at radio wavelenghts indicating that xte j1550 - 564 is a microquasar as well .",
    "we have applied the stripped - giant model to the bh lmxbs gx 339 - 4 and xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "these systems share the following properties : + ( i ) orbital periods in the range 1.5 - 1.7 d. + ( ii ) transient behaviour with frequent x - ray outburst + ( iii ) the very high state has been observed ( a total of only 4 system have shown this x - ray state ) + ( iv ) both are microquasars . + for the case of xte j1550 - 564 , where the companion star has been detected and its stellar parameters constrained , we find that the proposed evolutionary model successfully reproduces all the observables .",
    "therefore , it seems probable that xte j1550 - 564 harbours a stripped - giant companion .",
    "the case of gx339 is less straightforward since the companion star has not yet been observed . only through the detection of the niii / ciii bowen lines arising from the irradiated donor a lower limit ( @xmath81 km s@xmath18 ) to the velocity of the companion",
    "was established by h03 .",
    "we have applied the k - correction to this @xmath16 velocity and derived @xmath82 including the error bars in @xmath29 reported by h03 .",
    "this value represents a solid lower limit to the mass of the bh in this lmxb .",
    "this result comes from the assumption that the companion is a stripped - giant with the minimum possible mass .",
    "although there is not a definitive evidence for a stripped - giant donor in this system , this model is favoured by the @xmath83 d orbital period which clearly points to an evolved companion",
    ". moreover this evolutionary model is consistent with the transient behaviour of the source and also with the large number of x - ray outbursts displayed .",
    "the radius and luminosity predicted by the stripped - giant model also explain the non - detection of the companion by sfc01 . however , the above lower limit to @xmath30 is quite conservative and unrealistically small since the companion is not an helium white dwarf because it would not fill a 1.7 d roche lobe .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath76 predicted by the minimum mass solution yields an outburst duty cycle which is much too long to explain the frequent x - ray activity in gx 339 - 4 , with 4 outbursts in the last 10 years . assuming the ratio @xmath84 for gx 339 - 4 is similar than for xte j1550 - 564 ( @xmath85 ) we estimate @xmath86 yr@xmath18 , which results in @xmath87 .",
    "if we combine this limit with the k - correction we obtain @xmath88 considering the error bar in @xmath29 . although this lower limit is less secure than the one obtained through the minimum mass solution it is probably more realistic and better explains the frequent x - ray activity displayed by this source .",
    "note that the stripped - giant model is only valid for @xmath53 and hence if we consider heavier evolved companions ( e. g. giant stars ) with @xmath89 we would obtain higher @xmath30 values .",
    "however , as we explain in section [ companion ] , this possibility is at odds with the mean density of the donor derived from the orbital period . +",
    "we have applied the k - correction to the bh lmxb gx 339 - 4 . by considering the limit case where the emission line is formed at the limb of the irradiated region of the companion",
    "we derive a solid lower limit to @xmath0 including the error bars in @xmath29 . here",
    "we have only assumed @xmath90 , the lower limit allowed by the stripped giant model .",
    "we find that the stripped - giant evolutionary model explains the non - detection of the companion by sfc01 and the x - ray behaviour of the source .",
    "in particular , we propose @xmath91 , for which we predict @xmath92 large enough to explain the frequent x - ray outbursts displayed by this source .",
    "this limit results in @xmath93 . from the maximum mass solution we find @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , we have also shown that the stripped - giant model successfully explains the observable properties ( @xmath38 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) of the akin lmxb xte j1550 - 564 . +",
