    "the elastic collision with a nucleus is the main mechanism used by modern detectors to identify neutralinos , or more in general weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite .",
    "the cross section describing this collision can be separated in a part related to the interaction between the wimp and the single nucleon , and another one describing how the struck nucleon is inserted inside the nucleus @xcite . while the former term is one of the unknown which we aim to study in this type of investigations , the knowledge of the latter term is solid , and well grounded on many years of nuclear structure investigation .",
    "the procedures commonly adopted substitute the nucleon distribution inside the nucleus with the charge distribution which is experimentally known with high spatial resolution because it is extracted from the large body of accurate elastic electron scattering data . in specific applications the helm form factor @xcite is usually adopted because of its simple analytic expression whose parameters have been chosen to provide a good description of the empirical charge distributions overall the nuclear chart , but for very light nuclei .",
    "an improvement with respect to this approach has been proposed in ref .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the use of the experimental charge distributions in the calculations of the wimp - nucleus cross sections implies some simplifications of the problem . in the description of the cross section we consider the wimp interacting with the point - like nucleon , either proton or neutron . on the other hand",
    ", the nuclear charge density is mainly sensitive to the proton distributions folded with the electromagnetic proton form factor .    in this article",
    "we propose a methodology to get over these simplifications .",
    "our idea is to consider proton and neutron distributions generated by hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations .",
    "a work based on these ideas , and carried out within a relativistic - hartree framework , has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective nucleon - nucleon interactions used in hf calculations have been tuned to reproduce various ground state observables , among them also the charge root mean square ( rms ) radii of many isotopes . the remarkable success in describing elastic electron scattering data , and",
    "consequently charge distributions , indicates the reliability of these calculations in the description of the nuclear ground states .    in the present work we use a specific implementation of the non - relativistic hf theory , based on a density - dependent and finite - range nucleon - nucleon effective interaction @xcite .",
    "the performances of our approach have been tested against those of hf model which uses a zero - range interaction and those of a relativistic hartree approach @xcite .",
    "we found that the three types of calculations provide very similar descriptions of the ground state properties of spherical and closed shell nuclei .",
    "for this reason we are confident that our results are not simply related to a specific implementation of a particular nuclear structure model , but they represent the general predictions of any microscopic mean - field theory .",

    "we give in the appendix the fourier - bessel expansion coefficients of the proton and neutron distributions obtained in our calculations , for all the nuclei we have considered here .",
    "we write the probability that , in a detector with @xmath0 target nuclei , a nucleus , with a nucleons , recoils with an energy @xmath1 after an elastic collision with a wimp as = n_t _ v_min^ _ a ( v _ ) p(e_r , v _ ) ( v _ ) f(v _ ) dv _ , [ eq : re1 ] where @xmath2 is the velocity of the wimp with respect to the detector and @xmath3 is the minimum velocity that produces a detectable recoil in the apparatus . in the above equation , we have indicated with @xmath4 the wimp - nucleus elastic cross section , with @xmath5 the probability that the nucleus after been struck by the wimp with velocity @xmath2 recoils with energy @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the flux of wimps with velocity @xmath2 , and with @xmath8 the probability that the wimp has velocity @xmath2 .",
    "we express the number of target nuclei as the product of the detector mass times the avogadro s number divided by the target molecular weight , @xmath9 .",
    "the wimps flux is given by the wimps density times the velocity .",
    "we express the wimps density as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the energy density of the wimps , @xmath12 is the wimp mass and @xmath13 indicates , as usual , the speed of the light .    after the collision with a wimp of velocity @xmath2",
    ", the value of the nuclear recoil energy depends on the scattering angle .",
    "the nucleus may recoil with energies values between zero and e_r , max= v_^2 , [ eq : re2 ] where @xmath14 is the mass of the target nucleus and @xmath15 is the wimp - target nucleus reduced mass .",
    "the energetics of the collision is such that the scattering is dominated by the @xmath16 wave , therefore , because of the spherical symmetry of the scattered wave function , the probability @xmath5 is independent on the scattering angle , and can be expressed as p ( e_r , v _ ) = , [ eq : p ] with @xmath17 .    for the evaluation of @xmath8 we consider a maxwell s distribution of the velocities centered at an average velocity @xmath18 .",
    "in this way , we obtain for the differential rate of recoil the expression = _ a .",

    "the wimp - nucleus cross section can be separated in spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) terms @xcite , the latter one active only in odd - even nuclei . in this work",
    "we are only interested in the si term which we write as ^si_a = _ p | z f_p(q ) + g_np n f_n(q ) |^2 , [ eq : sigma2 ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the number of protons and neutrons inside the target nucleus . in the above expression",
    "we have factorized the elastic wimp - proton cross section @xmath24 , and we have indicated with @xmath25 the ratio between the wimp - neutron and proton cross sections .",

    "as we have already pointed out in the introduction , the procedure commonly adopted in the literature considers the form factors obtained by using the experimental charge density distributions .",
