    "as a part of the third phase of the sloan digital sky survey  ( sdss - iii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the marvels ( _ _ m__ulti - object _ _ a__po _ _ r__adial _ _ v__elocity _ _ e__xoplanet _ _ l__arge - area _ _ s__urvey ) project is searching for substellar companions by monitoring the radial velocities ( rvs ) of 3330 fgk stars  @xcite .",
    "this sample size is large enough for the project to find relatively rare objects , such as brown dwarf ( bd ) companions to solar - type stars .",
    "the paucity of observed bd companions to solar - type stars with separations of @xmath85 au is typically referred to as the bd desert  @xcite . since the size of the marvels sample allows us to begin to quantify how arid the bd desert may be , any marvels discovery of a bd in the desert ( or lack thereof ) is a step toward increasing our understanding of bd formation .",
    "in addition to its large homogeneous target sample , marvels differs from other surveys for substellar companions in two key ways .",
    "first , the project employs a dispersed fixed - delay interferometer  ( dfdi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "second , it uses a multi - object spectrograph to observe 60 stars simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "the dfdi prototype instrument was used to discover the first extrasolar planet around hd 102195 in 2006 with this new rv method  @xcite .",
    "the marvels dfdi technique combines an interferometer with a medium resolution spectrograph ( @xmath912,000 ) in order to obtain a precision of @xmath5100 m  s@xmath7 .",
    "given its rv precision and survey design to monitor each target with at least 24 rv measurements over at least 1 yr , marvels is sensitive to bd and low - mass stellar companions with periods ranging from a few days to hundreds of days .",
    "nonetheless , certain specific types of astrophysical false positives can mimic substellar companions unless additional vetting is performed .",
    "this paper describes just such a case , tyc-3010 - 1494 - 1 ( hereafter tyc 3010 ) , a stellar binary that initially appeared as a single star with a substellar companion and that , through a confluence of orbital parameters , continued to masquerade as such despite a disconcertingly extensive amount of observation and analysis .    when we began analysis of tyc 3010 , marvels and its pilot project had already detected two bd candidates orbiting late f stars in the bd desert  ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* at present , we have three more candidates in the desert : ) @xcite ) . the marvels discovery data indicated that tyc 3010  possessed a substellar companion with a minimum mass of @xmath10 and that it was on a @xmath5238-day moderately eccentric orbit with an rv amplitude of @xmath51.5  km  s@xmath7 ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : mc10rv_curve_bd ] ) .",
    "however , given the cadence of marvels and the period of the orbit , there were significant gaps in the phase coverage and additional observations with a different spectrograph were required to constrain the rv solution .",
    "initially , the follow - up data remained fully consistent with the bd companion scenario .",
    "however , during the course of the program , we found two rv points that were shifted by @xmath520  km  s@xmath7with respect to most of our data ; while investigating the source of these anomalous points , we realized that a few similar points had been rejected from our marvels discovery data by the team s outlier rejection procedures ( see bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mc10rv_curve_bd ] ) .",
    "examining the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of the anomalous rv points ( in both the discovery and subsequent data ) revealed evidence that there were two components in the ccf , which suggested that the companion to the primary was most likely a stellar - mass secondary .",
    "finally , including the initially flagged outlier measurements and disentangling the rv measurements of the two components , the system was found to be a nearly equal - mass stellar binary ( @xmath11 ) on a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "evidently , for a system like tyc 3010 , it is possible to clip just a few measurements and obtain an apparently reasonable solution that is convincing but completely incorrect .    as large scale rv and transit surveys for exoplanets",
    "become more common , it is increasingly inevitable that any and all forms of astrophysical false positives , despite their rarity , will be found .",
    "indeed , the first bd candidate discovered by the marvels project , , appeared to exhibit evidence for an additional planet - mass companion , but turned out instead to likely be a quadruple system , comprising four stars with no detected bd or planetary - mass companion  @xcite .",
    "akin to tyc 3010 , is a double - lined spectroscopic binary ; the stars have relative rvs which are sufficiently low that they are always blended , even at the resolution of the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; @xmath13 mode ) .",
    "thus , with both and tyc 3010 , we actually measure a flux - weighted mean of two sets of stellar spectral lines .",
    "this flux - weighted mean exhibits a suppressed velocity shift that mimics a single - lined binary with a bd secondary .",
    "both systems possess geometries that allow them to masquerade as less massive systems : is nearly face - on , which leads to low projected velocities , while tyc 3010  is on a highly elliptical orbit with a semi - major axis oriented nearly perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "similarly , @xcite describe what at first appeared to be a transiting bd companion to an f star from the tres transit survey , but turned out instead to be an f star blended with a g+m stellar eclipsing binary .",
    "the system that we describe here follows these unfortunate examples , and is similarly pernicious .    in the following sections , we present our analysis as a kind of cautionary tale for other rv surveys to avoid similar false positives . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we describe the spectroscopic and photometric data obtained for tyc 3010 . in section  [ sec : results ] , we discuss in detail the nature of the evidence that led us to conclude that tyc 3010  was an eccentric stellar binary instead of a bd companion to a solar - type star",
    ". we also present the properties we derived for both components of the spectroscopic binary . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the circumstances that allowed this false positive to masquerade for so long and through several vetting steps as a compelling detection of a substellar companion , and we describe methods that the marvels team and other rv surveys can use to recognize this kind of astrophysical false positive in the future . finally , in section  [ sec : summary",
    "] , we conclude with a summary of the main results .",
    "we obtained a total of 65 rv measurements from the sloan 2.5 m , the apo 3.5 m , and the het 9.2 m telescopes .",
    "we will briefly summarize the characteristics of the data from all three telescopes .",

    "a total of 28 spectra ( see table  [ tbl : sing_rvs ] ) of tyc 3010  were obtained with the sloan 2.5 m telescope  @xcite at apache point observatory ( apo ) .",
    "the multi - fiber marvels spectrograph  @xcite can simultaneously measure the rvs of 60 stars during each telescope pointing .",
    "both beams of the interferometer are imaged onto the detector , so each 50-minute observation results in two fringed spectra in the wavelength range of @xmath5500570 nm with a resolving power of @xmath14 .",

    "the rv signal from tyc 3010  initially seemed to indicate that it was a bd orbiting a solar - type star in the bd desert . over 80% of the marvels discovery data agreed with this interpretation , and there seemed to be plausible reasons for excluding the outliers .",
    "however , once similar outliers were found in the subsequent observations , we began to suspect the validity of the bd interpretation . in this section , we discuss in detail why we initially favored the bd interpretation , as well as how this conclusion was abruptly overturned by a few surprising data points .    in the discovery data",
    ", there were four outliers in total , each offset by @xmath520 km  s@xmath7  from the rest of the data .",
    "the most anomalous of the outliers was extracted from a spectrum with a low s / n , so its rv value did not seem trustworthy . the remaining outliers",
    "( considering that they corresponded to a @xmath520 km  s@xmath7  offset in rv that was only captured once during the three orbits contained in the discovery data ) , also seemed likely to be spurious .",
    "the marvels spectrograph is a fiber - fed spectrograph that can observe 60 objects simultaneously .",
    "each fiber is plugged by hand to observe the correct target , and occasionally a mistake may occur . indeed , the marvels data vetting procedures were evolved to specifically include an outlier rejection step that sought to mitigate such errors , by searching for consecutive strings of measurements that were offset from the bulk of the data in a similar fashion to how these four measurements behave .    remarkably , excluding these few apparent `` outliers''and in fact _ only _ by excluding them  permits a convincing orbit solution .",
    "it is not intuitive that this should be the case , in particular because only @xmath515% of the measurements are excluded ( including both the discovery data and the initial follow - up data which appeared to corroborate the spurious solution ) and because the resulting solution is so dramatically different from the true solution .",
    "evidently , a system such as tyc 3010  ( with its extreme eccentricity , leading to punctuated large rv excursions , and its orbital orientation being nearly perpendicular to the line of sight , leading to very small rv variations for @xmath595% of the orbit ) is able to mimic a more circular orbit of a low - mass companion about a single star .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the two stars in tyc 3010  leads to a combined light sed that is only slightly different from that of a single star at a nearer distance .",
    "thus many lines of evidence supported the initial solution , considering that the bd interpretation appeared to be supported by two years of discovery rv data , six months of additional rv observations , lucky imaging , and a well - constrained sed . indeed , when the two follow - up rv measurements observed near periastron appeared , indicating a possible problem with the original orbit solution , we began to search for reasons to suspect the validity of these two anomalous points .",
    "at first , we thought the situation might be similar to the fiber mis - pluggings believed to have occurred with the discovery data , and we considered that the arces outliers were the result of pointing at the wrong star . but after investigating the data from those two nights , we confirmed that we had observed the correct target .",
    "next we learned of a recent change that had been made to the arces instrument : the thar lamp had recently been replaced .",
    "the thar lamp is used to perform the wavelength calibration , and it was plausible that the new lamp might have caused problems with the wavelength solution .",
    "therefore , the arces outliers may have merely been the result of an artificial doppler shift generated by an incorrect wavelength solution . in the end",
    ", we were only able to accept that the bd interpretation was incorrect after we inspected the ccf for each of the outliers .",
    "the ccfs for the outliers both showed two peaks instead of one , indicating the presence of a second stellar component .",
    "furthermore , the secondary peak was comparable in height to the primary peak ( see bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ccfs ] ) , which led us to suspect that tyc 3010  was in fact a spectroscopic stellar binary .",
    "but how did most of the data that we had for tyc 3010  conspire to imply that it was a much less massive system ?",
    "the period , shape , and orientation of the orbit with respect to the line of sight ( see figure  [ fig : mc10_schematic ] ) made it such that for most of the orbit the two stars possess relatively low rvs with respect to each other .",
    "in particular , the difference between the magnitude of their rvs is smaller than the typical ccf width for our instruments , resulting in their ccf peaks being blended into one .",
    "since the flux ratio is not too different from unity , and the mass ratio is also close to unity , for epochs where the spectral lines are blended , there is a near - cancellation ( or strong suppression ) of the true orbital velocities for the primary and secondary , which are nearly equal in magnitude but oppositely signed ( see equation  [ eqn : deblend ] , and recall that @xmath201 is what we actually measure ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath595% of the orbit , the amplitude of the variations ( @xmath512 km  s@xmath7 ) suggest a bd companion to a solar - type star ; furthermore , the eccentricity and the orbital period ensure that the stars spend a long time ( @xmath57 months ) away from periastron , which is precisely the moment when the rvs of the components are disparate enough for it to be fairly easy to resolve the two sets of spectral lines , and the large rv amplitude ( @xmath51520 km  s@xmath7 ) is indicative of a stellar binary with two solar - type stars .",
    "moreover , the orientation makes it so that only a relatively small component of the orbital velocities is directed along our line of sight . finally , the cadence of the marvels survey made it unlikely to observe multiple epochs of periastron .",
    "for any given rv survey , the lower the resolution of the spectrograph , the more vigilant one must be for these kinds of false positives .",
    "for tyc 3010  in particular , a spectrograph with a resolution of @xmath202 is required to resolve the spectral lines throughout most of the orbit .",
    "but in general , as the resolution ( and cadence of observations ) decreases , the wider the range of eccentricities , arguments of periastron , and orbital periods by which stellar binaries could masquerade as substellar companions for significant fractions of their orbits .    furthermore , longer period orbits ( @xmath203yr ) should be handled with special care , for in these cases the phase coverage is more likely to be incomplete . in order to survey @xmath53,000 stars over four years , marvels required a cadence that made it less likely to observe multiple epochs of periastron for a binary with the period of tyc 3010 . for marvels and similar rv surveys for substellar companions",
    ", it can be costly to use precious resources to examine false positives .",
    "therefore , in this section , we describe a method that the marvels team currently employs to identify binaries like tyc 3010  during the candidate - vetting process .    for typical rv surveys today , a standard line bisector analysis can usually be performed to assess the presence of blended double - lined binaries . however , this was not possible for the marvels discovery data due to its limited spectral resolution .",
    "thus , following our experience with tyc 3010 , marvels has developed an internal pipeline for inspecting the widths of the ccf peaks for all of our candidates .",
    "this way , we can readily monitor the ccfs for signs that indicate that there may be more than one stellar component present ( e.g. , the large excursions in the width of the ccf peak that occur near periastron for tyc 3010 ; see figure  [ fig : ccf_widths ] ) .",
    "there are two properties of the ccfs that we now monitor : ( 1 ) the average width of the ccf peak compared to other stars in the survey , and ( 2 ) any other significant changes in the shape of the ccf over time .    for a typical solar - type star that is not rotating too rapidly ( i.e. , the kinds of stars that marvels targets )",
    ", one would expect the width of the ccf peak to be @xmath510 km  s@xmath7 , which is largely the result of thermal broadening and micro - turbulence .",
    "however , when binary systems like tyc 3010  are unresolved , the widths of the ccf peak are broader ( @xmath520 km  s@xmath7 ) , indicating that there may be multiple stellar components contributing to the flux from the system ( see figure  [ fig : ccf_widths ] ) .",
    "in fact , an atypically broad ccf peak could also be the result of a single star rotating atypically fast , so a broad peak is not in itself sufficient to identify the system as a binary .",
    "nevertheless , a broad peak should be taken as a sign to proceed with caution .",
    "furthermore , changes in the skewness of the ccf peak might provide an even more sensitive diagnostic for these kinds of systems .",
    "thus , by monitoring changes in the ccf peak , even if one misses the small fraction of the orbit where , depending on the resolution , the ccf peak either broadens dramatically or separates into distinct peaks ( or if one is suspicious of the relatively few epochs where the system happened to be caught near periastron ) , it is possible to flag systems like tyc 3010 , which may contain much more mass than most of the rv data suggests .",
    "the case of tyc 3010  is also a pertinent lesson on how important it is to handle outliers carefully , especially in this era of large surveys where thousands of objects must be screened for the most favorable candidates .",
    "we possessed plausible reasons for suspecting that the outliers in the discovery data might be spurious ( known issues with fiber mis - pluggings ; low s / n ; and the outliers were only detected during one of the three orbits observed ) .",
    "moreover , and perhaps ironically , the spurious orbit solution is actually a better fit to the discovery data ( excluding the outliers ) than the true orbit solution , because of the need to disentangle the primary and secondary rv components from the ( apparently ) single - lined rv measurements .",
    "however , even when faced with such a compelling initial solution and sensible reasons for considering the outliers to be invalid , it is imperative to investigate further and provide evidence that the reasons for rejecting the outliers are not only plausible but justified .",
    "furthermore , when the analysis is distributed among multiple team members like it is within marvels , it is necessary to make sure each step of the analysis is documented as clearly as possible . for marvels ,",
    "the members who perform the candidate - vetting are usually different from those who perform the subsequent analysis for each candidate , so it is important for each team member to be able to readily discover if any outliers were rejected and why .",
    "marvels has now modified its internal analysis tracking system in order to make the entire analysis process more transparent .    finally , if we had been monitoring the widths of the ccf peaks , we could have considered the evidence of the broad peak , as well as the changing peak width around periastron , though in truth neither the changing width nor the broad peak by themselves would have likely been sufficiently compelling to reject the initial orbit solution . in the end ,",
    "the most important part of our analysis was to strategically focus our het / hrs observations on periastron , the phase where the outliers occurred and where it was easiest to resolve the spectral lines .",
    "this strategy would have been more difficult with a conventionally scheduled telescope , but was readily achieved with the queue - scheduled nature of the het .",
    "we have demonstrated , using high resolution spectroscopy , that tyc 3010  is an sb2 .",
    "we have shown how , with a spectrograph below a given resolution ( @xmath204 ) , the eccentricity and the orientation of the system with respect to our line - of - sight allowed a large fraction of the rv curve to appear remarkably similar to the kind of signal one would expect from a bd secondary as opposed to a stellar - mass secondary . furthermore , as a result of the cadence of the marvels survey and the orbital period of the system , we were more likely to miss periastron during a given orbit .",
    "thus , we were more susceptible to rejecting the periastron points we did obtain as outliers , even though these points are where the spectral lines are most widely separated , and thereby where it is easiest to determine that the system is an sb2 .    finally , we concluded with a word of warning to rv surveys , since for a given resolution and cadence , there are a range of orbital parameters that can make a stellar - mass binary companion appear to be substellar . the lower the resolution or cadence , the greater the number of stellar binaries that can masquerade in a fashion similar to tyc 3010 . therefore ,",
    "if other surveys can carefully monitor the widths of the ccf peaks for their targets ( or monitor their line bisectors if they have high enough resolution ) , and when possible , focus their resources on observations of peripassage , then we hope that they will be able to avoid similar astrophysical false positives .",
