    "the _ fermi _ satellite has opened a new and sensitive window in the study of grbs ( gamma - ray bursts ) ; for a general review of grbs see gehrels , ramirez - ruiz & fox ( 2009 ) , mszros ( 2006 ) , piran ( 2004 ) , woosley & bloom ( 2006 ) , zhang ( 2007 ) .",
    "so far , in about one year of operation , _ fermi _ has detected 12 grbs with photons with energies @xmath0100 mev .",
    "the @xmath010@xmath1 mev emission of most bursts detected by the lat ( large area telescope : energy coverage 20 mev to @xmath0300 gev ) instrument aboard the _ fermi _ satellite shows two very interesting features ( omedei et al .",
    "2009 ) : ( 1 ) the first @xmath0100 mev photon arrives later than the first lower energy photon ( @xmath21 mev ) detected by gbm ( gamma - ray burst monitor ) , ( 2 ) the @xmath0100 mev emission lasts for much longer time compared to the burst duration in the sub - mev band ( the light curve in sub - mev band declines very rapidly ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we next check to see if the predicted magnitude of the synchrotron flux in the es is consistent with the observed values .",
    "this calculation would seem very uncertain at first , but we note that the predicted external forward shock synchrotron flux at a frequency larger than all characteristic frequencies of the synchrotron emission is independent of the circum - stellar medium ( csm ) density , @xmath3 , and it is extremely weakly dependent on the fraction of the energy of the shocked gas in the magnetic field , @xmath4 , which is a highly uncertain parameter for the es model .",
    "the density falls off as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance from the center of the explosion , and @xmath7 corresponds to a constant csm and @xmath8 corresponds to a csm carved out by the progenitor star s wind .",
    "the flux is given by ( see e.g. kumar 2000 , panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fraction of energy of the shocked gas in electrons , @xmath11 is the time since the beginning of the explosion in the observer frame ( in units of 10s ) , @xmath12 is photon energy in units of 100mev , @xmath13erg is the scaled isotropic kinetic energy in the es , @xmath14 is the compton-@xmath14 parameter , @xmath15 is the redshift and @xmath16 is the luminosity distance to the burst ( in units of @xmath17 cm ) . using the values of table 1 , we can predict the expected flux at 100 mev from the es and compare it to the observed value at the same time .",
    "we show in table 2 that the observed high energy flux is consistent with the theoretically expected values for all three busts .",
    "the fact that these bursts satisfy the closure relation , and that the observed @xmath18mev flux is consistent with theoretical expectations , suggests that the high energy emission detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat from grbs is produced via synchrotron emission in the es . in the next section",
    "we carry out a more detailed analysis that includes all the available data from these bursts during the  afterglow \" phase , i.e. after the emission in the sub - mev band has ended ( or fallen below _ fermi_/gbm threshold ) .",
    "the simple arguments presented in the last section provide tantalizing evidence that the high energy photons from the three bursts considered in this paper are synchrotron photons produced in the external forward shock .",
    "we present a more detailed analysis in this section where we consider all available data for the three bursts after the end of the emission in the _",
    "fermi_/gbm band , i.e. for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the  burst duration \" provided in table 1 . the data we consider consist of @xmath18mev emission observed by _",
    "fermi_/lat and agile / grid , x - ray data from swift / xrt , optical data from swift / uvot and various ground based observatories , and radio data from westerbork in the case of grb 090902b .",
    "the _ main idea _ is to use the @xmath18mev data to constrain the es parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 .",
    "however , these last two can be estimated fairly directly by looking at the spectrum and temporal decay indeces of the light curves at different wavelengths . ]",
    " which as we shall see allow for a large hyper - surface in this space  and for each of the points in the allowed 4-d parameter space calculate the flux in the x - ray , optical and radio bands from the external forward shock at those times where data in one of these bands are available for comparison with the observed value",
    ". it would be tempting to think that such an exercise can not be very illuminating as the es flux calculated at any given time in these bands would have a large uncertainly that would reflect the large volume of the sub - space of 4-d parameter space allowed by the @xmath010@xmath1mev data alone .",
    "this , however , turns out to be incorrect  the afterglow flux generated by the es in the x - ray and optical bands ( before the time of jet break ) is almost uniquely determined from the high - energy photon flux ; the entire sub - space of the 4-d space , allowed by the @xmath010@xmath1mev data , projects to an extremely small region ( almost to a point ) as far as the emission at any frequency larger than @xmath23 is concerned ; @xmath24 is the synchrotron frequency corresponding to the minimum energy of injected electrons ( electrons just behind the shock front ) , which we also refer to as synchrotron injection frequency .",
    "therefore , we can compare the es model predictions of flux in the x - ray and optical bands with the observed data , and either rule out the es origin for high energy photons or confirm it .",
    "we also carry out this exercise in the _ reverse direction _ , i.e. find the sub - space of 4-d parameter space allowed by the late time ( @xmath251day ) x - ray , optical , and radio data , and then calculate the expected @xmath010@xmath1mev flux at early times for this allowed subspace for comparison with the observed _ fermi_/lat data . this _ reverse direction _",
    "exercise is not equivalent to the one described in the preceding paragraph since the 4-d sub - space allowed by the @xmath010@xmath1mev data and that by the late time x - ray and optical data are in general quite different ( of course they have common points whenever early high - energy and late low energy emissions arise from the same es ) .",
    "the input physics in all of these calculations consist of the following main ingredients : synchrotron frequency and flux ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 for detailed formulae ; a convenient summary of the relevant equations can also be found in kumar & narayan 2009 ) , blanford - mckee self - similar solution for the es ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , electron cooling due to synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton radiation ( klein - nishina reduction to the cross - section is very important to incorporate for all the three bursts for at least a fraction of the 4-d parameter space ) , and the emergent synchrotron spectrum as described in e.g. sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) .",
    "although the calculations we present in the following sections can be carried out analytically ( e.g. kumar & mcmahon 2008 ) , it is somewhat tedious , and so we have coded all the relevant physics in a program and use that for finding the allowed part of 4-d parameter space and for comparing the results of theoretical calculation with the observed data .",
    "numerical codes have also the advantage that they enable us to make fewer assumptions and approximations .",
    "nevertheless , we present a few analytical estimates to give the reader a flavor of the calculations involved .",
    "we analyze the data for each of the three bursts individually in the following three sub - sections in reverse chronological order .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat and gbm observations of this burst can be found in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009c ) . the x - ray data for this grb started at about half a day after the trigger time .",
    "the spectrum in the 0.310 kev x - ray band was found to be @xmath26 , and the light curve decayed as @xmath27 ( pandey et al .",
    "2010 ) . the optical observations by swift / uvot started at the same time ( swenson & stratta 2009 ) and show @xmath28 .",
    "rotse also detected the optical afterglow starting at @xmath29 hours and its decay is consistent with the uvot decay ( pandey et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the faulkes telescope north also observed the afterglow at about @xmath30 hours after the burst using the r filter ( guidorzi et al .",
    "there is a radio detection available at about 1.3 days after the burst and its flux is @xmath31jy at @xmath32ghz ( van der host et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the late time afterglow data obtained by swift / xrt show that the x - ray band , 0.310 kev ( @xmath33 ) , should lie between @xmath24 ( the synchrotron injection frequency ) and @xmath34 ( the synchrotron frequency corresponding to the electrons energy for which the radiative loss time - scale equals the dynamical time ; we also refer to it as synchrotron cooling frequency ) .",
    "this is because @xmath35 , otherwise the light curve would be rising with time instead of the observed decline .",
    "moreover , if @xmath36 , then @xmath37 , and in that case @xmath38 , and that is inconsistent with the observed decline of the x - ray light curve ( for decay indeces for values of @xmath39 see the table 1 in zhang & mszros ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "thus , @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 or @xmath42 .    next we determine if the x - ray data are consistent with a constant density circum - stellar medium or a wind - like medium . for @xmath7 ( @xmath8 )",
    "the expected temporal decay index of the x - ray light curve is @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , a constant density circum - stellar medium is favored for this grb .",
    "the xrt flux at 1kev at @xmath45hr was reported to be @xmath46jy ( pandey et al . 2010 ) . extrapolating this flux to the optical band using the observed values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 we find the flux at 21hr to be within a factor @xmath49 of the @xmath50jy flux reported by guidorzi et al .",
    "thus , the emissions in the optical and the x - ray bands arise in the same source ( es ) with @xmath24 below the optical band ; also , if the optical band were below @xmath24 , then the optical light curve would be increasing with time , which is not observed .",
    "moreover , the optical and x - ray data together provide a more accurate determination of the spectral index to be @xmath51 or @xmath52 which is consistent with the @xmath22-value for the high - energy data at @xmath19 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "if the @xmath010@xmath1mev emission is produced in the external forward shock then we should be able to show that the early high energy @xmath53-ray flux is consistent with the late time x - ray and optical data .",
    "we first show this approximately using analytical calculations , and then present results obtained by a more accurate numerical calculation in our figures .    the observed flux at 100 mev and @xmath54s can be extrapolated to half a day to estimate the flux at 1 kev .",
    "this requires the knowledge of where @xmath34 lies at this time .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath55 mev at 50 s in order that the flux at 100 kev does not exceed the observed flux limit ( see subsection below ) . therefore",
    ", @xmath56 is @xmath49 mev at 12.5 hr , and thus the expected flux at 1 kev is @xmath57jy which agrees with the observed value .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the @xmath0100mev , x - ray and optical photons were all produced by the same source , and we suggest that this source must be the external forward shock as already determined for the x - ray and optical data .",
    "we now turn to determining the es parameter space for this burst .",
    "we can determine this space using both the forward direction and reverse direction approaches .",
    "we first list the constraints on the es model , then give a few analytical estimates using the equations in , for example , panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) , and then present the results of our detail numerical calculations .      in this subsection",
    "we only use the early high - energy emission to constrain the es parameter space .",
    "the constraints at @xmath54 s are : ( i ) the flux at 100 mev should agree with the observed value ( see table 2 ) - within the error bar of 10% , ( ii ) @xmath58mev at 50s for consistency with the observed spectrum , ( iii ) the flux at 100 kev should be smaller than 0.04 mjy ( which is a factor of 10 less than the observed value ) , so that es emission does not prevent the _ fermi_/gbm light curve to decay steeply after 25 seconds , and ( iv ) @xmath59 so that the energy going into the second inverse compton is not excessive .",
    "the first 3 conditions give the following 3 equations at @xmath54 s. the cooling frequency is given by ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 )    @xmath60    the flux at 100 kev , which is between @xmath24 and @xmath34 as discussed above , is ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 )    @xmath61    and lastly , using ( 1 ) , the flux at 100 mev , which we assume is above @xmath34 , is @xmath62 solving for @xmath3 from ( 3 ) and for @xmath10 from ( 4 ) , and substituting in ( 2 ) , we find that at 50 s @xmath63 mev .",
    "the injection frequency can also be estimated at @xmath54 s , it is given by    @xmath64    and using ( 4 ) , one finds @xmath65 , which gives @xmath66 kev for @xmath67 .",
    "these values of @xmath24 and @xmath34 are consistent with the values obtained with detail numerical calculations and reported in the fig . 1 caption .    using ( 2 )",
    ", we can find a lower limit on @xmath4 , which is given by @xmath68 also , we can solve for @xmath10 using ( 4 ) and substitute that into ( 3 ) to obtain an upper limit on @xmath4 , which is @xmath69 note that these estimates are consistent with the numerical results we present in fig .",
    "1 . we also find the @xmath70 dependence that is shown in the figure .    moreover , with these parameters we can predict the fluxes at late times . the x - ray and optical band lie between @xmath24 and @xmath34 at @xmath71 1 day ( see above ) .",
    "the first x - ray data point is at 12.5 hr , and the theoretically expected flux at 1 kev at this time is given by    @xmath72    and the optical flux at @xmath73 s is    @xmath74    we can use ( 3 ) to find an upper limit for the x - ray and optical fluxes .",
    "in addition , we can find @xmath10 using ( 4 ) , and use ( 6 ) to find a lower limit for these fluxes .",
    "we find that    @xmath75    for the x - ray flux at 12.5 hr , and    @xmath76    for the optical flux at @xmath73 s. these estimates agree very well with the observed values of @xmath77 jy ( pandey et al .",
    "2010 ) and @xmath78jy ( guidorzi et al . 2009 ) at the respective bands and times .",
    "we note that , although inverse compton cooling is very important at late times , the x - ray band lies below @xmath34 and therefore x - ray and optical fluxes are unaffected by inverse compton cooling .",
    "next , we present the results obtained by detailed numerical calculations .",
    "we use the same constraints described at the beginning of this subsection to determine the parameter space allowed by the high - energy early data .",
    "it is worth noting that in our numerical calculations throughout the paper we make no assumption regarding the ordering of the characteristic frequencies , nor the location of the observed bands with respect to them .",
    "the projection of the sub - space of the 4-d parameter space allowed by the high energy data onto the @xmath4@xmath3 plane is shown in figure [ 090902b - epsilonb ] , and some of the other es parameters are presented in the fig . 1 caption .",
    "it is clear that there is a large sub - space that is consistent with the lat data , and also that the magnetic field needed for the synchrotron source is consistent with the shock - compressed magnetic field in the csm of strength @xmath79 g . for each point in the 4-d space allowed by the @xmath010@xmath1mev data we calculate the x - ray and the optical flux at late times . in spite of the fact that the 4-d sub - space allowed by the lat data is very large ( fig .",
    "[ 090902b - epsilonb ] ) the expected x - ray and optical flux at late times lie in a narrow range as shown by two diagonal bands in figure [ 090902b - fwd ] ; the width of these bands has been artificially increased by a factor 2 to reflect the approximate treatment of the radial structure of the blast wave and also to include in the calculation the effect of the blast wave spherical curvature on the es emission ( see , e.g. , appendix a of panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; both of these effects together contribute roughly a factor of 2 ) .",
    "we see that the observed x - ray and optical light curves lie within the theoretically calculated bands ( fig .",
    "[ 090902b - fwd ] ) .",
    "this result strongly supports the es model for the origin of the @xmath010@xmath1mev photons .",
    "we note that the above mentioned extrapolation from early time , high - energy , data to late time , low - energy , flux prediction was carried out for a csm with @xmath7 .",
    "we have also carried out the same calculation but by assuming a wind medium ( @xmath8 ) , and in this case we find that the expected flux at late times is smaller than the observed values by a factor of @xmath80 or more ; this conclusion is drawn by comparing the late optical and x - ray fluxes predicted at a single time with the observations at that same time , i.e. without making use of the temporal decay indices observed in these bands .",
    "we pointed out above that the late time afterglow data for this burst are consistent with a uniform density medium , but not with a @xmath8 medium .",
    "thus , there is a good agreement between the late time afterglow data and the early @xmath010@xmath1mev data in regards to the property of the csm ; the two methods explore the csm density at different radii .",
    "we carry out the above mentioned exercise in the reverse direction as well , i.e. we determine the es parameter space using only the late time x - ray , optical and radio data , and use these parameters to determine the flux at 10@xmath1mev at early times when _",
    "fermi_/lat observations were made .",
    "the constraints on es model parameters at late times are the following : ( i ) the x - ray and optical flux at 12.5 hr and @xmath81 s , respectively , should match the es flux at these bands and at these times , ( ii ) the radio flux at 1.3 d should be consistent with the observed value .",
    "we first show some analytical estimates and then turn to more detailed numerical calculations .",
    "constraint ( i ) is simply equation ( 8) set equal to the observed value of @xmath77 jy at 12.5 hr . for the analytical estimates presented here ,",
    "it is not necessary to use the optical flux at late times , since both the optical and x - ray bands lie between @xmath24 and @xmath34 , so they provide identical constraints . constraint ( ii ) , assuming that the radio frequency is below @xmath24 , gives    @xmath82    solving for @xmath10 in the last equation and substituting in constraint ( i ) gives an equation for @xmath4 , which is    @xmath83    this estimate is consistent with the numerical result presented on fig .",
    "[ 090902b - epsilonblate ] .",
    "moreover , one can see that we find @xmath84 , which is exactly what is found numerically ( and agrees very well with the shock - compressed csm field prediction ) .",
    "we can now predict the high - energy flux at 100 mev and early time using the es parameters determined using late time afterglow data in x - ray and radio bands .",
    "we use ( 1 ) at @xmath54 s , substituting @xmath10 from ( 12 ) and @xmath3 from ( 13 ) , and find that the flux should be    @xmath85    in agreement with the observed value at @xmath54 s. we now turn to our numerical results .",
    "using the same set of constraints presented at the beginning of this subsection , we perform our numerical calculations to determine the es parameter space allowed by the late time ( @xmath86 d ) x - ray , optical and radio data and use that information to `` predict '' the 100 mev flux at early times ( @xmath87 s ) .",
    "the numerical results of this exercise , for a @xmath7 csm medium , are also in good agreement with the _",
    "fermi_/lat data as shown in figure [ 090902b - reverse ] .",
    "moreover , the flux from the es at @xmath54s and 100 kev is found to be much smaller than the flux observed by _",
    "fermi_/gbm ( fig .",
    "[ 090902b - reverse ] - left panel ) , which is very reassuring , because otherwise this would be in serious conflict with the steep decline of the light curve observed in the sub - mev band ; this also shows that the sub - mev and gev radiations are produced by two different sources .",
    "we note that the range of values for @xmath4 allowed by the late time radio , optical & x - ray afterglow data is entirely consistent with shock compressed circum - stellar medium magnetic field of strength @xmath88 g ( see fig .",
    "[ 090902b - epsilonblate ] ) .",
    "we also point out that the afterglow flux depends on the magnetic field @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , therefore , there is a degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath3 and that makes it very difficult to determine @xmath3 uniquely .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat and gbm observations of this burst are described in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009b ) and de pasquale et al .",
    "this short burst has very early x - ray and optical data starting only 100s after the burst .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is @xmath91 ( grupe & hoverstein 2009 ) .",
    "the temporal decay index is @xmath92 during the initial @xmath93s and subsequently the decay steepens to @xmath94 with a break at @xmath95ks .",
    "the optical data shows @xmath96 and @xmath97 with a break at @xmath98ks ( de pasquale et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in the context of the es model ( also considered by gao et al .",
    "2009 , ghirlanda , ghisellini , nava 2010 and de pasquale et al .",
    "2010 for the case of this specific burst ) , the data suggests that @xmath99 , because in this case @xmath41 , so @xmath100 and the temporal decay index ( for @xmath7 ) is @xmath101 consistent with the observed value of @xmath102 . if we take @xmath103 , then @xmath104 , so @xmath105 and the temporal decay index should have been @xmath106 , since @xmath39 , which is consistent with the observed temporal decay , however , the expected optical light curve index for this value of @xmath22 is @xmath107 , which is inconsistent with the observed value of @xmath108 ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "the x - ray afterglow data also shows that the medium in the vicinity of the burst must have been of constant density .",
    "this is because , for an @xmath8 medium , the expected temporal decay of the x - ray flux , when @xmath99 , is @xmath109  much steeper than the observed decline of @xmath110  while for @xmath7 the expected decline is consistent with observations ( gao et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "given the fact that the break in the optical light curve and that in the x - ray light curve occur at the same time , i.e. @xmath111 , it is unlikely that the emission in these two bands comes from two different , unrelated sources .",
    "thus , it is natural to attribute both the optical and x - ray emissions to the external forward shock .",
    "the fact that the optical light curve is rising during the first @xmath112hr as @xmath113 means that @xmath114 during this time period ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) , where @xmath115 is the optical band .",
    "the break seen in both light curves can be attributed to the jet break .",
    "the x - ray light curve decay of @xmath116 for @xmath117s agrees very well with the expected post - jet - break light curve of @xmath118 ( rhoads 1999 ) , and suggests a jet opening angle of @xmath119 ( sari , piran & halpern , 1999 ) .",
    "the reason that @xmath120 is not as steep can be understood the following way . at the time of the jet break",
    ", the optical band is below @xmath24 , therefore , the light curve decays as @xmath121 instead of @xmath122 ( rhoads 1999 ) . at later times ,",
    "when @xmath24 , which is decreasing rapidly , crosses the optical band , the optical light curve will transition slowly from @xmath121 to @xmath122 , and that is why @xmath120 is not as large as @xmath123 ; the timescale for this transition can be long / short depending on how far above @xmath124 the asymptotic distribution of @xmath125 is attained .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the results of our numerical calculation shown in figure [ 090510-epsilonb ]  we obtain a value of @xmath126ev at 100s , which should cross the optical band at @xmath127s - a factor of @xmath128 larger than the observed time of the jet break .",
    "this idea can be tested with optical data available at much later times : it should show the light curve slowly steepening to the asymptotic value of @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , the optical spectrum before the break in the light curve ( @xmath129 ) should be consistent with @xmath130 .",
    "is it possible that the rise of the optical band light curve might be due to the onset of the es , while the initial x - ray emission ( until the break at @xmath29 ks ) and the gamma - ray photons are from the `` internal shock '' mechanism ( de pasquale et al .",
    "this seems unlikely , given that the density of the csm required for the deceleration time of the grb jet to be @xmath131s ( @xmath132 ) is extremely low , as can be seen from the following equation    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is the mass of the proton , @xmath135 is the speed of light , @xmath136 is the initial lorentz factor of the grb jet , @xmath137 is the time when the peak of the light curve is observed and @xmath21 is the isotropic energy in the es . for grb 090510 , @xmath136 was determined to be @xmath138 by using @xmath139 opacity arguments ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b ) , which is a limit applicable to the scenario proposed by de pasquale et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , where mev and gev photons are produced in the same source .",
    "we take @xmath140 and @xmath141 and find that we need a csm density of @xmath142 , which is much smaller than the mean density of the universe at this redshift , and therefore unphysical .",
    "even though there is a strong dependence of csm density on @xmath136 , the upper limit on density provided above can not be increased by more than a factor of @xmath143 , since the error in the determination of @xmath136 is much less than a factor of 2 ( abdo et al .",
    "thus , the possibility that the peak of the optical light curve at @xmath131s is due to the deceleration of the grb jet seems very unlikely .",
    "we note that in the scenario we present in this paper , the @xmath144 mev emission observed by _",
    "fermi_/lat and the lower energy ( @xmath145 mev ) observed by _",
    "fermi_/gbm are produced by two different sources , therefore , the pair - production argument ca nt be used to constrain @xmath136 . however , in this scenario , the deceleration time for the grb jet is @xmath145 s , and that means that the peak of the optical light curve at @xmath93 s can not correspond to the deceleration time .",
    "we conclude that the available data suggest that optical and x - ray photons are coming from the same source ( es model ) .",
    "we now consider whether the observed @xmath0100 mev emission is also consistent with the es model .",
    "we first use the observed data to show that @xmath0100 mev , x - ray and optical data are produced by the es , then we provide some analytical estimates of the es model parameters and later show the results of our detailed numerical results in the figures .",

    "therefore , the photon flux at 100s in this band is estimated to be @xmath150 @xmath147 s@xmath148 ( ghirlanda , ghisellini , nava , 2010 ; have also reported a single power - law decline of flux in the _ fermi _ lat band from @xmath711s to 200s ) .",

    "2010 )  to extrapolate the observed photon count in the xrt band to the grid band we find the expected photon flux at 100s in the 30 mev30 gev band of @xmath151 @xmath147 s@xmath148 , and that is consistent with the flux observed by agile .",

    "since we attribute the optical light curve peak with the crossing of @xmath24 through the optical band , then the peak of the optical light curve determines the synchrotron flux at the peak of the spectrum .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that @xmath0100 mev , x - ray and optical emissions are all produced by the same source , and that source must be the external forward shock as that is known to produce long lasting radiation in the x - ray and optical bands with a well known closure relation between @xmath157 and @xmath158 that is observed in grb 090510 in all energy bands .    using the data in the lat , xrt and optical bands",
    "we can determine the es parameters for grb 090510 .",

    "2010 ) , and ( iv ) the flux at the peak of synchrotron spectrum should be @xmath153jy ( de pasquale et al .",
    "this last constraint arises because the optical flux peaks when @xmath24 passes the optical band , and therefore the peak synchrotron flux should be equal to the measured peak optical flux ; it should be noted that the peak synchrotron flux for @xmath7 according to the es model does not change with time as long as the shock front moves at a relativistic speed .",
    "we present some analytical estimates for the es parameters before showing our detailed numerical results . the es flux at 100 mev and @xmath159 s , assuming that 100 mev is above @xmath34 is given by ( 1 ) and is    @xmath160    which is the constraint ( i ) . the flux at 4 kev and 1000s , assuming that it is between @xmath24 and @xmath34 is given by    @xmath161    which is constraint ( iii ) . and",

    ", we can solve @xmath10 from ( 16 ) and substitute it in ( 17 ) , which gives    @xmath163    consistent with the numerical calculation presented in fig .",
    "also , with this last expression and using ( 18 ) we find that the csm density for this grb is    @xmath164    which is also consistent with the fact that we only find numerical solutions with csm densities lower than @xmath710.1 @xmath165 .    for the es parameters of this burst , the cooling frequency at 100 s",

    "note that all the available data for grb 090510 can be fitted by the es model and that the value of @xmath3 allowed by the data is less than 0.1 @xmath165 , which is in keeping with the low density expected in the neighborhood of short bursts .",

    "the _ fermi_/lat and gbm observations for this burst have been presented in abdo et al .",

    "the optical and x - ray observations started about 1d after the burst and both bands are consistent with @xmath172 ( greiner et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the fact that the optical light curve is decaying as @xmath173 means that @xmath24 is below the optical band at 1 day , because if @xmath24 is above the optical band , then the light curve should be rising as @xmath174 ( as in the case of grb090510 ) .",
    "moreover , the shallow spectral index in the swift / xrt band ( @xmath175 ) suggests that @xmath176kev at 1 day .",
    "the x - ray and optical data together yield a spectral index of @xmath177 , and therefore @xmath178 which is consistent with the _ fermi_/lat spectrum ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath22 can be used to calculate the time dependence of the light curve , and that is found to be @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) for @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) csm .",
    "thus , @xmath8 csm is preferred by the late time optical and x - ray afterglow data ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 ; gao et al .",

    "only , we determine the es model parameters . with these parameters",

    "the constraints that should be satisfied are : ( i ) the es flux at 100 mev and 150 s should match the observed value ( table 2 ) , ( ii ) @xmath58 mev to be consistent with the observed spectrum , and ( iii ) the es flux at 150 s should be smaller than the observed value to allow the 100 kev flux to decay rapidly as observed .",
    "these constraints are the same as the ones presented for the case of grb090902b and the analytical approach is the same as the one presented on  3.1 , therefore , we omit the details here . the es parameters obtained numerically",
    "can be found in fig . 2 of kumar & barniol duran ( 2009 ) .",
    "with these parameters the x - ray and optical flux at late times can be calculated , and we find these in excellent agreement with the observations ( figure [ 080916c - fwd ] ) .",
    "it is important to note here that this extrapolation from high - energy early time data to low energy , late time , flux prediction was carried out for a circum - stellar medium with @xmath181 .",
    "we have also carried out the same calculation but for a uniform density medium ( @xmath7 ) , and in this case the theoretically calculated flux at late times is larger than the observed values by a factor of @xmath715 or more ; the factor of 5 discrepancy is much larger than error in the flux calculation .",
    "we pointed out above that the late time afterglow data for this burst are consistent with a @xmath8 medium but not @xmath7 medium .",
    "thus , there is a nice agreement between the late time afterglow data and the early @xmath010@xmath1mev data  which explore very different radii  in regards to the density stratification of the csm .",
    "we have carried out the exercise in the `` reverse direction '' as well . using only the late x - ray and optical data ,",
    "we determine the es parameters .",
    "the observational constraints that need to be satisfied are : ( i ) the es flux at x - ray and optical energies at 1 d should match the observed values , ( ii ) we should have the ordering @xmath182 to be consistent with the observed spectrum , ( iii ) the es flux at 150 s should be smaller than the observed value to allow the 100 kev flux to decay rapidly as observed , and ( iv ) the lorentz factor of the ejecta should be @xmath183 at 1 d , since we do nt want @xmath136 to be too small at the beginning of the burst , because this would contradict estimates done at early times ( greiner et al .",
    "since the analytical approach is very similar to the one for grb090902b , we omit it here  the only difference is that it must be done for a wind - like medium , since the data of this grb prefers it .",
    "the es parameters can be found numerically and with these parameters we predict the @xmath0100 mev flux at early times .",
    "this predicted flux agrees with the _",
    "fermi_/lat observations as shown in fig . 3 of kumar & barniol duran ( 2009 ) .",
    "the _ fermi _ satellite has detected 12 grbs with @xmath0100 mev emission in about one year of operation . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath0100 mev emission of three of them : two long - grbs ( 090902b and 080916c ) and one short burst ( grb 090510 ) , and find that the data for all three bursts are consistent with synchrotron emission in the external forward shock .",
    "this idea was initially proposed in our previous work on grb 080916c ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) , shortly after the publication of this burst s data by abdo et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "now , there are three grbs for which high energy data has been published , and for all of them we have presented here multiple lines of evidence that @xmath0100 mev photons , subsequent to the prompt grb phase , were generated in the external forward shock .",
    "the reason that high energy photons are detected from only a small fraction of grbs observed by _",
    "fermi _ is likely due to the fact that the high energy flux from the external forward shock has a strong dependence on the grb jet lorentz factor , and therefore very bright bursts with large lorentz factors are the only ones detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat ( this was pointed out by kumar & barniol duran 2009 , who also suggested that there should be no difference in long and short bursts , as far as the @xmath0100 mev emission is concerned - the high energy flux is only a function of burst energy and time , eq .",
    "1 ) .    we have analyzed the data in 4 different ways , and all of them lead to the same conclusion regarding the origin of @xmath010@xmath1mev photons .",
    "first , we verified that the temporal decay index for the @xmath0100 mev light curve and the spectral index are consistent with the closure relation expected for the synchrotron emission in the external forward shock .",
    "second , we calculated the expected magnitude of the synchrotron flux at 100 mev according to the external forward shock model and find that to be consistent with the observed value .",
    "third , using the @xmath0100 mev data only , we determined the external shock parameters , and from these parameters we predict the x - ray and optical fluxes at late times and find that these predicted fluxes are consistent with the observed values within the uncertainty of our calculations , i.e. a factor of two ( see figs .",
    "[ 090902b - fwd ] , [ 080916c - fwd ] ) . and lastly , using the late time x - ray , optical and radio fluxes  which the grb community has believed for a long time to be produced in the external forward shock  we determine the external shock parameters , and using these parameters we predict the expected @xmath0100 mev flux at early times and find the flux to be in agreement with the observed value ( see fig .",
    "[ 090902b - reverse ] ) .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0100 mev emission and the lower energy ( @xmath145 mev ) emission are produced by two different sources at two different locations suggests that we should be cautious when using the highest observed photon energy and pair - production arguments to determine the lorentz factor of the grb jet .",
    "we point out that the external shocks for these bursts were nearly adiabatic , i.e. radiative losses are small .",
    "the evidence for this comes from two different observations : ( 1 ) the late time x - ray spectrum lies in the adiabatic regime ; ( 2 ) a radiative shock at early times ( close to the deceleration time ) would produce emission in the 1010@xmath1 kev band far in excess of the observed limits .",
    "we find that radiative shock is not needed to explain the temporal decay index of the @xmath0100 mev light curve as suggested by ( ghisellini , ghirlanda , nava 2010 ) , provided that the observing band is above all synchrotron characteristic frequencies .",
    "we find that the magnetic field required in the external forward shock for the observed high and low energy emissions for these three bursts is consistent with shock - compressed magnetic field in the csm ; the magnetic field in the csm  before shock compression",
    " should be on the order of a few tens of micro - gauss ( see figs .",
    "[ 090902b - epsilonb ] , [ 090902b - epsilonblate ] and [ 090510-epsilonb ] ) .",
    "for these three bursts , at least , no magnetic dynamo is needed to operate behind the shock front to amplify the magnetic field .",
    "the data for the short burst ( grb 090510 ) are consistent with the medium in the vicinity of the burst ( within @xmath711 pc ) being uniform and with density less than 0.1 @xmath165 ; the data rules out a csm where @xmath184 . on the other hand ,",
    "the data for one of the two long _ fermi _ bursts ( grb 080916c ) prefers a wind like medium and the other ( grb 090902b ) a uniform density medium ; these conclusions are reached independently from late time afterglow data alone and from the early time high energy data projected to late time using the 4-d parameter space technique described in  3 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the power - law index of the energy distribution of injected electrons ( @xmath22 ) in the shocked fluid , for all the three _ fermi _ bursts analyzed in this work , is @xmath185 to within the error of measurement , suggesting an agreement with the _ fermi _ acceleration of particles in highly relativistic shocks , e.g. achterberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; a unique power - law index for electrons distribution in highly relativistic shocks is not found in all simulations .",
    "the study of high energy emission close to the deceleration time of grb jets is likely to shed light on the onset of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration process .",
    "it might seem surprising that we are able to fit all data ( optical , x - ray , @xmath186mev ) for these three _ fermi _ bursts with just a few parameters for the external forward shock .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to swift bursts which often display a variety of puzzling ( poorly understood ) features in their afterglow light curves .",
    "there are two reasons that these _ fermi _ bursts can be understood using a very simple model ( external forward shock ) .",
    "( 1 ) the data for the two long _ fermi _ bursts ( 080916c and 090902b ) are not available during the first 1/2 day , and that is precisely the time frame when complicated features ( plateau , etc . , eg .",
    "nousek et al .",
    "2006 , obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) are seen in the x - ray afterglow light curves of swift bursts ( we note that the external forward shock model in its simplest form ca nt explain these features )  however , the afterglow data at later times is almost invariably a smooth single ( or double ) power - law function that can be modeled by synchrotron emission from an external forward shock . ( 2 ) for very energetic grbs  the three bursts we have analyzed in this paper are among the brightest bursts in their class  the progenitor star is likely to be completely destroyed leaving behind very little material to fall back onto the compact remnant at the center to fuel continued activity and give rise to complex features during the first few hours of the x - ray afterglow light curve ( kumar , narayan & johnson , 2008 ) .",
    "to summarize , the grb afterglow physics was simple in the decade preceding the launch of swift , and then things became quite complicated , and now the _ fermi _ data might be helping to clear the fog and reveal the underlying simplicity once again .",
