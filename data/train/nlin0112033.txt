    "this aproach is known also as the lagrangian one versus the eulerian one .    while the study of tracer dynamics is not sufficient to provide full information about the corresponding flow , it can reveal an important information about the flow transitions from one regime to another .",
    "an important example of the tracer dynamics appears for the so - called abc ( arnold - beltrami - childress ) flow ( @xcite ) for which the tracer dynamics coincides with streamline trajectories , is hamiltonian ( @xcite ) , and consists of regular and chaotic domains in phase space for all nonzero values of the flow parameters ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we call trajectories to be _ pseudochaotic _ if @xmath3 but the equations that define the trajectories are not integrable .",
    "it was shown for some cases of the pseudochaos ( @xcite ) that the ensemble of trajectories can be considered in a statistical manner and can be described by a kind of kinetic equation with fractional derivatives .",
    "kinetics of trajectories reflects self - similarity of dynamics and superdiffusive equations for the moments of a distribution function along coordinates , i.e. superdiffusive transport .",

    "there is no one - to - one correspondence between the field - line trajectories problem and the billiard one .",
    "nevertheless , the study of particle dynamics in the billiard - type systems can provide a realistic insight on different possibilities of the dynamics as it has happened with the sinai billiard .",
    "we consider different billiard - type models with zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "these models can be applied straightforwardly to such physical problems as ray dynamics in a media with complex ( fractal ) boundary ( @xcite , @xcite ) , light ( @xcite ) and sound ( @xcite ) propagation in nonuniform media , magnetic field lines in toroidal plasmas ( @xcite ) , tracer dynamics in reconnected vortices ( @xcite ) , etc .",
    "similar problems proved to be interesting in problems of quantum chaos ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and general problems of anomalous transport ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "in this paper we briefly review our previous results on the kinetics and transport properties of the trajectories in a family of polygonal billiards and the corresponding lorentz - type gases ( @xcite ) , and present new results on the transport exponents and more complicated billiard - type models .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here , that while there is a way of evaluating the transport exponents for iet ( @xcite ) , these results can not be applied immediately to the transport exponent of trajectories , and a special analysis of trajectories and their ensemble is necessary .",
    "there are three separate problems related to the pseudochaotic kinetics , that will be briefly discussed here : transport in the rhombic billiard , log - periodic properties of continued fractions , and the origin of specific exponents for poincar recurrences .",
    "we will speak about the particle dynamics having in mind a tracer or a field line as a particle trajectory .",
    "examples of the filamented and merged surfaces are given in figures 2.1(a ) and ( b ) correspondingly .",
    "the case ( a ) appears in the toroidal palsma confinement ( @xcite , @xcite ) while the case ( b ) can appear in both plasma and fluids . under some conditions ,",
    "the problem of the geodesics along surfaces can be reduced to the problem of trajectories in ellastic billiards ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some examples of billiards are given in figure 2.2 billiards must have rational angles to be reducible to the equivalent dynamics along surfaces .",
    "each of the billiards in figure 2.2 can be periodically continued in two or one directions ( figures 2.3 and 2.4 ) creating a `` generalized lorentz gas '' ( glg ) .",
    "as an example , let us point an evident connection between geodesics in figure 2.1(a ) , and trajectories in figures 2.2(a ) and 2.3(a ) .",
    "billiard trajectories can be studied by introducing a map of some interval into itself . for the case in figure 2.2(a ) one can consider the map of the slit into itself , which belongs to the type of the interval exchange transformation : ( iet ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are some common features between all four types of problems mentioned above : geodesics along complex surfaces , billiards , glg , and iet .",
    "all of them correspond to the dynamics with zero lyapunov exponent , i.e. two initially close trajectories diverge not faster than a power of time . all of them describe the so - called pseudo - integrable ( but not integrable ) situation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all of them correspond to the dynamics with the weak - mixing ( @xcite , @xcite ) ( more accurate formulation can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall ( @xcite ) that for almost arbitrary square integrable functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the coordinate @xmath6 in phase space , the weak mixing means that @xmath7 ^ 2 = 0 \\eqno ( 2.1)\\ ] ] while the mixing , or strong mixing , means @xmath8 = 0 \\eqno ( 2.2)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a time - shift operator and @xmath10 means the averaging over a corresponding measure .",
    "weak mixing can be accompanied by arbitrary large and long - lasting bursts , i.e. fluctuations with large deviations from zero of the correlation function @xmath11 these fluctuations exist simultaneously with the property that time average of @xmath12 is zero .",
    "a sample of trajectory for the billiard in figure 2.2(a ) or glg in figure 2.3(a ) is given in figure 2.5 indicating arbitrary long - lasting almost periodic pieces of the trajectory .",
    "there is no one - to - one correspondence between four different types of the above - mentioned systems : geodesics on a compact surface , billiard , glg , and iet .",
    "for example , properties of the iet obtained in @xcite are not sufficient to describe kinetics of trajectories in the corresponding billiard since the equation for the mapping time is not involved in iet .",
    "this explains a major difficulty in studying the billiards and glg .",
    "let us mention that iet dynamics and polygonal billiard dynamics is ergodic and weak mixing ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but there is only a conjecture that the complexity of the billiard trajectories is at most polynomial ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "due to this , we will call _ pseudochaotic _ the dynamics of trajectories in billiards and glg , when their lyapunov exponent is zero and their complexity is , at most , algebraic .",
    "as it will be shown , such billiards can reveal fairly good statistical properties .",
    "let us provide a few examples for the billiard with a slit in figure 2.2(a ) and the corresponding glg in figure 2.3(a ) @xcite .",

    "the values ( 2.10 ) are almost independent on the length of the slit and the launching angle . this universality will be commented later as well as deviations from ( 2.8)-(2.10 ) .",
    "the results ( 2.8)-(2.10 ) can be immediately transferred to the billiards in figure 2.2(b ) and to the glg in figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) , since trajectories do not change initial tangent of the angles during the scattering .",
    "formula ( 2.8 ) shows anomalous transport @xmath28 of the superdiffusion type and an approximate self - similarity since @xmath29 .",
    "all these properties and deviations from them will be discussed in the forthcoming sections .",
    "let us start from the two equal - squares - lattices in figures 3(e , f ) with infinite and finite horizons , respectively .",
    "some squares are rotated by an angle of irrational tangent with respect to the others . due to that , almost all trajectories rotate ergodically in the coordinate space in contrary to the billiards in figures 3(a - d ) .",

    "there are two important features common for both figures .",
    "first , the trajectories have arbitrary long flights .",
    "we call `` a flight '' any long part of the trajectory that , after small scale averaging , is almost regular",
    ". such pieces of trajectories correspond to an intermittent dynamics and they are responsible for the distribution functions with tails and for fractional kinetics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the trajectories have similarity in small and in large time and space scales .",
    "the self - similarity is less evident in figures 3.1 , 3.2 than in figure 2.5 .",
    "more delicate description of the trajectories can be obtained from simulations .    a trajectory with two , small and large , time intervals ( two top plates ) , and the moments @xmath31 ( regular lines ) , @xmath21 ( dash - point lines ) , and distribution of the recurrences @xmath32 .",
    "the data for the two bottom plates are obtained after averaging over 8,192 trajectories and time @xmath33 for each .",

    "the simulation gives @xmath38 in a good agreement with the relation ( 2.10 ) .",
