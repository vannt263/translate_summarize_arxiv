    "inclusive hadron production in various processes gives the possibility to carry out quantitative tests of the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "the essential property of qcd cross - sections which allows comparisons between various processes is the factorization property .",
    "indeed thanks to the factorization theorem @xcite , the cross - sections are written as convolutions of basic building blocks , such as the quark and gluon distributions in the incoming hadrons , the hard subprocesses describing the large - angle scattering of partons , and the fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "the parton distributions and fragmentation functions can be defined in a universal way . therefore these distributions measured in one reaction can be used to perform predictions for another reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the subprocess cross - section is entirely calculable in perturbative qcd , the only free parameter being @xmath4 .",
    "many processes involving fragmentation functions can be related in this manner . among them",
    "the best studied are the @xmath5-annihilation into hadrons @xmath6 , the observation of hadrons in dis experiments @xmath7 , and the hadro- and photo - production of large-@xmath0 hadrons @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ". clearly quantitative studies of these reactions can only be performed if sets of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) fragmentation functions are available .    while there are several sets of parton distribution functions for the proton and the pion , mainly extracted from dis data , few sets of fragmentation functions exist .",
    "it is only recently that many precise data on the hadron energy spectrum in @xmath5-annihilation became available from lep experiments , completing those obtained at lower energy at desy , slac and tristan .",
    "the accuracy of these data is remarkable  ; they should allow a determination of fragmentation functions with a precision which approaches that obtained in the parton distribution functions .",
    "a first step towards a nlo analysis of fragmentation functions has been done by chiappetta et al .",
    "( cggrw collaboration ) @xcite , who studied the fragmentation into @xmath10 .",
    "as lep data did not exist at that time , these authors also made a detailed study of large-@xmath0 @xmath10 cross - sections , measured by isr experiments and the ua2 collaboration , in order to constrain their parametrizations .",
    "lep data was used by binnewies , kniehl and kramer ( bkk coll . ) , in association with lower energy results of pep and petra , to determine the parton fragmentation into charged pions and kaons , and into neutral kaons @xcite . from these results and the measured ratio @xmath11",
    ", they indirectly obtained fragmentation functions for charged particles .",
    "we pursue these studies and propose parametrizations of the parton fragmentation functions into charged particles by directly analyzing the corresponding @xmath5 data .",
    "the interest of such functions is that they can be used in all reactions in which there is no particle identification . on the other hand",
    "this set of fragmentation functions can be compared with the bkk set , thus offering an estimation of the `` theoretical error '' embedded in the parametrizations and which comes from various theoretical assumptions used to perform fits to data .",
    "we shall see , in section 3 , that the gluon fragmentation function is poorly constrained by @xmath5 data .",
    "therefore we shall complete our anlysis by that of the hadron - production of large-@xmath0 charged hadrons , a reaction which is sensitive to the gluon fragmentation function .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the theoretical expressions we use to calculate the single inclusive hadron cross - section in @xmath5-annihilation , and we describe the parametrization of the non - perturbative boundary conditions associated to the dglap evolution equations for the fragmentation functions .",
    "we also pay attention to an improved choice of the renormalization and factorization scales . in section 3",
    ", we describe the fits to lep and petra data and discuss our results .",
    "then we study , in section 4 , the constraints put on the gluon fragmentation function by large-@xmath0 hadron production .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "in the qcd - improved parton model , the single inclusive cross - section is given by the expression    [ 1e ] dn^h dz = 1 _ tot  d(e^+e^- hx ) dz = _ a = q,|q , g _ z^1 dy y d_a^h ( y , m^2 ) 1 _ tot  d_a dv ( v = z y , ^2 , m^2 , q^2 )  .    the longitudinal variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 measure the fraction of the energy @xmath16 , available in the @xmath5 cms , carried away by the hadron @xmath17 and the parton @xmath18 . the fragmentation functions @xmath19 describe the non - perturbative transition of parton @xmath18 into hadron @xmath17 .",
    "only the dependence on the factorization scale @xmath20 is perturbatively calculable and given by the dglap evolution equation    [ 2e ] m^2  d_a^h(m^2 ) m^2 = _ a p_ba^t d_b^h(m^2 )    where @xmath21 indicates a convolution  : @xmath22 .",
    "the time - like kernels are expansions in @xmath23    [ 3e ] p_ba^t(m^2 ) = _ s 2 ( m^2 )  p_ba^(0 ) + ( _ s 2(m^2 ) ) ^2  p_ba^t(1 ) +    in this paper we work at the nlo approximation and when solving ( [ 2e ] ) , we use the nlo kernels @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) can be solved more easily by working in moment - space .",
    "we use this formalism here as well as a computer code written by p. nason @xcite .",

    "s(^2 ) ) ( 1 - _ s ( ^2 ) ) .    throughout this paper , we work at nlo accuracy and do not take into account the nnlo expressions calculated by rijken and van neerven @xcite .",
    "several reasons impose this choice .",
    "first , the full nnlo correction is not known  ; the 3-loop dglap kernel is missing .",
    "second , we shall use these fragmentation functions in the calculation of cross section for which only nlo expressions are available ( for instance large-@xmath0 inclusive cross sections )  ; it appears more coherent to also use nlo parametrizations of the fragmentation functions .",
    "one must also notice that the nllo corrections to the @xmath5 inclusive cross section are very small when @xmath31 is not too close to zero or one @xcite . in this paper , we study data in the range @xmath32 , and for @xmath33 the experimental errors are larger than the nllo corrections .    in order to neglect kinematical higher twists of order @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a hadron mass and @xmath36 its momentum , we restrict the @xmath31-range ( @xmath37 studied by the condition @xmath38 .",
    "this condition also allows us to neglect `` mlla '' effects @xcite which show up at small @xmath31 and are not included in the nlo formalism described in this section .    on the other hand",
    "the @xmath39 corrections to the longitudinal cross section @xmath40 calculated in @xcite are non - negligible .",
    "however we will not use this cross section to constrain to gluon fragmentation functions @xmath41 , because data at large @xmath31 ( @xmath42 is scarce and not very precise .",
    "finally let us mention that we work in the @xmath43 scheme and that we use massless expressions for the dglap kernels and the hard cross sections .",
    "however we take into account the bottom threshold by starting the evolution of the @xmath44-quark fragmentation function at @xmath45 .",
    "the cross - section ( [ 1e ] ) depends on arbitrary scales which show up in the course of the theoretical calculations  : the renormalization scale @xmath46 and the factorization scale @xmath20 .",
    "they must be chosen of the order of @xmath16 , but their precise value can not be determined by any fondamental rule .",
    "however several approaches exist which propose prescriptions to improve the choice of these scales  ; we adopt here the `` principle of minimum sensitivity '' criterion @xcite . at the order @xmath26 at which @xmath25 is calculated ( lo calculation in @xmath26 ) ,",
    "no prescription constrains @xmath46 and we choose @xmath47 .",
    "then we fix @xmath20 using the pms criterion    [ 6e ] .",
    "m^2  m^2 ( dn dz ) |_m = m_opt = 0 .",
    "we find by a numerical study of ( [ 6e ] ) that @xmath48 is much smaller than @xmath49 . in a large range in @xmath31 , we have @xmath50",
    ". however at small values of @xmath31 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 starts to increase to values as large as @xmath16 . at mark",
    "ii @xcite energy ( @xmath53  gev ) , the pms criterion does not work for @xmath54  ; there is no solution of equation ( [ 6e ] ) .",
    "because of this result , we shall only study data with @xmath55  gev .",
    "this leads us to discard pep data .    as already discussed , the non - perturbative physics of the cross - section ( [ 1e ] ) is entirely contained in the fragmentation functions @xmath56 .",
    "the perturbative evolution of these fragmentation functions is given by eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) which must be supplemented by a non - perturbative initial condition .",
    "the latter is fixed by the @xmath57-behavior of the fragmentation functions at an initial scale @xmath58 .",
    "as we are interested in the use of the fragmentation functions in reactions where the scale @xmath20 can be of the order of a few gev ( hadro- or photoproduction of large-@xmath0 particles ) , we start the evolution at a small value of @xmath20 , namely @xmath59  gev@xmath2 ( @xmath45 for @xmath60 ) . at this value of @xmath20 , we fix the shape of the fragmentation function by using a simple and standard parametrization    [ 7e ] & & d_g ( y , q_0 ^ 2 ) = n_g ( 1 - y)^_g  y^_g + & & d_u ( y , q_0 ^ 2 ) = ( n_u(1 - y)^_u + |n_u ( 1 - y)^|_u ) y^_u + & & d_d+s ( y , q_0 ^ 2 ) = ( n_d+s(1 - y)^_d+s + |n_d+s ( 1 - y)^|_d+s ) y^_u + & & d_c ( y , q_0 ^ 2 ) = n_c ( 1 - y)^_c  y^_c + & & d_b ( y , m_b^2 ) = n_b ( 1 - y)^_b y^_b .    let us say a few words on the theoretical and `` experimental '' reasons for this parametrization .",
    "first we notice that the @xmath5-annihilation cross - section is only sensitive to the sum @xmath61 .",
    "so we are not able to determine @xmath62 and @xmath63 separately .",
    "this degeneracy could be lifted by looking at dis data , or at data on the production of large-@xmath0 particles .",
    "however the large -@xmath0 production cross - sections , at ua1 and ua2 energy , are sensitive to the gluon fragmentation function , and very little to the @xmath64-quark fragmentation function . therefore in this paper , we will not give separate descriptions of the @xmath64- and @xmath65-quark fragmentation functions .",
    "on the other hand , in order to reduce the number of free parameters of the fit , we assume that the small-@xmath31 behaviour of the light quarks are the same  : @xmath66 .    by performing a fit to @xmath5 data ( see next section ) , we observed that several parameters of the input ( [ 7e ] ) are strongly correlated with each other .",
    "for instance @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are strongly correlated , as well as @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath44-parameters also are strongly correlated with each other .",
    "because of these correlations , the fitting procedure is very lengthy and we can not obtain a positive definite error matrix .",
    "therefore we proceed in two steps .",
    "first we perform a fit with all parameters free",
    ". then , in order to reduce the correlations , we fix some parameters to the values obtained in the first fit .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "we also observed a strong correlation between the gluon parameters and the functional shape of the input distribution @xmath75 .",
    "a simple form of the type @xmath76 leads to a gluon fragmentation function which is in disagreement with large-@xmath0 charged particle data of ua1 @xcite .",
    "thus we use more flexible shapes , as those of formula ( [ 7e ] ) , in order to try to decorrelate , as far as possible , gluon and light quark parameters .    in the present paper , we do not intend to determine from data the value of @xmath77 .",
    "this value might be sensitive to power corrections @xcite and such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "here we use a fixed value of @xmath78  : @xmath79 300 mev , in agreement with the cteq4 m @xcite and mrst @xcite distribution functions .",
    "one must note that this value is quite in agreement with the new value obtained in ref@xcite in a fit to @xmath5 annihilation data .",
    "inclusive charged particle data from cello @xcite at @xmath16 = 35 gev , from tasso @xcite at @xmath16 = 44 gev , from amy @xcite at @xmath16 = 58 gev , from delphi @xcite and sld @xcite at @xmath16 = 91.2 gev are used in the fits . to constrain the flavor dependent parameters ,",
    "the uds , c and b flavor enriched samples from aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite and opal @xcite are used .",
    "a b enriched sample from delphi @xcite has also been included .    to take into account the experimental systematics errors , avoiding the treatment of correlated errors ,",
    "the following procedure has been adopted : the normalization errors are not included in the @xmath80 evaluation but a normalization for each experiment is taken as a parameter of the fit allowed to vary within 3 standard deviations of the quoted experimental uncertainty .",
    "for aleph , as we use enriched samples in the fit , we do not used the all charged data which has correlated errors @xcite .",
    "the normalization of aleph ligth quark sample is kept fixed to 1 . , while a common normalization @xmath81 ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) is allowed for all opal samples ( delphi 94 samples @xcite , delphi @xcite ) .    using the program minuit @xcite",
    ", we performed a first fit to data , obtaining a reasonable result with @xmath84 for @xmath85 data points and @xmath86 parameters .",
    "in particular the data normalization factors are very close to one .",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , we observe strong correlations between the parameters and the error matrix is not positive definite .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath72 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 leads us to fix the diffferences @xmath90 and @xmath91 to the results of the first fit namely @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , we fix @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the @xmath80 is now 204 for @xmath85 points and @xmath96 parameters .",
    "but the fit is not yet converging and the error matrix is not positive definite . the source of this problem lies in the remaining strong correlation between @xmath97 and @xmath98 . fixing also @xmath97 and @xmath98 we eventually get a convergent fit . relaxing the condition @xmath99 also lead to a convergent fit with a positive definite error matrix and the following parameters for the non - perturbative inputs at @xmath100  gev@xmath2 .",
    "( the data normalization factors @xmath101 are also fixed to the values obtained in the first fit )    @xmath102    the corresponding @xmath80 is 201 for @xmath85 data points and @xmath103 parameters . + a technical discussion of errors and correlation matrices is given in appendix 1 .",
    "here we just quote the results of a full analysis ( minos @xcite,@xcite ) on the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we obtain a variation of @xmath80 by one unit when increasing ( decreasing ) the value of @xmath67 to 5.25 ( 1.10 ) , leaving the other parameteres free .",
    "these alternative fits are studied and used in section 4 where we discuss large - pt data .",
    "one notices that the gluon input is flat , comparable to the light quark fragmentation functions .",
    "however @xmath5 inclusive cross sections poorly constrain the gluon fragmentation function and the gluon parameters are determined with a large errror .",
    "the gluon fragmentation function corresponds to an @xmath104 correction to the born cross section , and it is quite sensitive to the functional forms of the light quark inputs .",
    "therefore we can not draw any physical conclusion from this result . however , it turns out that the gluon ( [ 8e ] ) gives a good description of the ua1 large-@xmath0 data .",
    "this point will be developed in section  4 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our fit to the corresponding data by using ratios and linear scales which exhibit agreements or disagreement more clearly .",
    "the experimental error is the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic errors .",
    "let us start the discussion by the @xmath44-enriched cross sections ( fig .",
    "[ figb1],[figb2 ] ) .",
    "the agreement is generally good , but one notices at large @xmath31 some discrepancies between the various data sets which might indicate that the systematic errors are underestimated .",

    "[ figc ] and fig .",
    "[ figpetra ] .",
    "cello and tasso data ( fig .",
    "[ figpetra ] ) are mainly sensitive to the @xmath106 and @xmath105-quark fragmentation functions , whereas light - quark enriched lep sample ( aleph uds , delphi , opal uds , delphi uds ) are sensitive to the @xmath64 and @xmath65-quark fragmentation function . here one also notices some dispersion of the lep light quark data at large @xmath31 .",

    "[ figallch ] .    in fig .",
    "[ compbkk ] we compare the result of our fit with the bkk fragmentation function @xcite at @xmath107 .",
    "the two parametrizations are in reasonable agreement for @xmath108  ; however one must keep in mind that bkk studied pion and kaon cross sections , and indirectly all charged cross sections ( see below ) . in fig .",
    "[ ratbkk ] we display ratios of fragmentation functions on a linear scale in order to compare them more closely .",
    "the @xmath106-quark and @xmath44-quark fragmentation functions are harder in bkk .",
    "the effect could be understood partly as follows : the ratio of proton / pion cross section , inspired from data ( fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) , has been given the form @xmath109 by bkk .",
    "however , the high @xmath57 part of this form , not constrained by data , is negative above 0.7 ; as a result their fit to all charged hadrons up to @xmath110 will have a tendency to enlarge some of the quark fragmentation functions in the large-@xmath57 region . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath65-quark fragmentation function is constrained by kaon production in bkk approach and can not be directly compared to our parametrization which does not distinguish between @xmath65-quark and @xmath64-quark  ; from fig .",
    "[ ratbkk ] one can deduce that the ratio @xmath111 increases from 1.1 at @xmath112 to 1.5 at @xmath113 .",
    "the gluon fragmentation functions have different shapes but , as already discussed , they are not very well constrained by @xmath5 annihilation data .",
    "the bkk collaboration also performed a direct fit of aleph charged hadron data and we can compare the parametrizations given in the thesis of j. binnewies @xcite with our results .",

    "the agreement between the quark distributions is reasonable for @xmath114 . for @xmath115 ,",
    "our fragmentation functions are much larger than those of ref .",
    "one reason for this difference may come from the choice of the data .",
    "we choose to fit all lep data . as a result ,",
    "our cross sections overshoot aleph data in the large-@xmath31 domain . on the other hand binnewies parametrization",
    "slightly undershoots aleph data .",
    "let us also notice that in ref .",
    "@xcite aleph data is studied only in the range @xmath116 .",
    "therefore we may expect differences with our parametrizations for @xmath117 .",
    "finally , one must also keep in mind that we used `` optimized '' cross sections ( expression ( [ 6e ] ) ) whereas bkk used the scale @xmath118 .",
    "moreover the bottom threshold is set at @xmath119 by the bkk collaboration whereas we have @xmath120 .",
    "this may introduce slight differences between the parametrizations .",

    "@xcite also compared his parametrization with the bkk one and observed disagreements for @xmath121 .",
    "the behaviors of the ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ ratbkk ] have similarities with those shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the quark fragmentation functions .",
    "but one notes a strong disagreement for the gluon fragmentation function which is very small for @xmath122 in ref .",
    "@xcite compared to the bkk parametrization .",
    "such a behavior seems to be in contradiction with the large - pt ua1 data discussed in the next section . where an 83% ( 54% ) contribution to the cross section is due to the gluon fragmentation at @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "the determination of the gluon fragmentation function @xmath126 from the inclusive @xmath5 cross section is not very precise .",
    "the gluon contribution to the cross section is a nlo effect , and , during the fitting procedure , we found that the gluon parameters were quite sensitive to the functional form at @xmath58 chosen for the quark distributions .",
    "a better constraint could come from the longitudinal cross section @xmath40 .",
    "but data at large @xmath31 , where we want to determine @xmath126 , is rare and not accurate .",

    "we obtain two new sets of parameters and a @xmath80 value increased by one unity  : @xmath134 .",

    "although many lep data are now available , including samples with enhanced content in heavy quarks , we find that it is impossible to obtain a convergent fit when using three ( or five for the @xmath106-quark ) free parameters to characterize the input shapes of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "there are strong correlations between the parameters and we do not obtain a positive definite error matrix .    fixing some of the strongly correlated parameters to values obtained in a fit characterized by a good @xmath80 , we succeed in obtaining a positive definite error matrix .",
    "the overall agreement with data is quite good .",
    "comparing our parametrizations of the fragmentation functions with those obtained by the bkk collaboration @xcite , we note several important discrepancies , especially in the large-@xmath31 domain .",
    "these discrepancies should come from the assumption made by the bkk collaboration on the large-@xmath31 behavior of the charged hadron cross sections .",
    "a better agreement is reached with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in which charged cross sections are also studied .",
    "but in the large-@xmath31 region , one again notes important discrepancies .",
    "one explanation of the discrepancy could be the fact that we use sets of data extending to larger @xmath31-values than those fitted in @xcite .",
    "this point also emphasizes the necessity to carefully treat the large-@xmath31 region and to resum the large logarithms in the theoretical expressions . in this work",
    "this is done through the optimized scales which should also be used in the calculation of other reactions making use of the present parametrization .",
    "we also test the gluon fragmentation function in large-@xmath0 hadronic collisions .",
    "we find that 3 sets of fragmentation functions allowed by @xmath5 data within one standard deviation and differing in the gluon shape lead to very similar predictions for large-@xmath0 cross sections at the @xmath139 energy .",

    "these errors should be taken as lower limits on the errors , as some parameters , which may be correlated to the ones estimated , have been fixed in the fitting procedure .",
