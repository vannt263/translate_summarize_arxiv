    "hence , non - starforming objects are by definition denser than starforming ones . this effect is amplified ( or caused ) by the fact that red galaxies typically reside in overdense environments , and thus assembled faster @xcite .",
    "stellar mass surface density thus encodes accelerated evolution , but is not otherwise connected to the cessation of star formation ( @xcite ; lc16 ; @xcite ; hereafter m16 ) . confirming either scenario requires establishing robust progenitor / descendant links for finely graded classes of galaxies using series of single - epoch data .",

    "hence , figure [ fig : densevo ] is consistent with evolutionary rates / clocks being set by ( baryonic ) densities at early times ( @xmath35 ) , then remaining fixed @xcite .",
    "denser galaxies born earlier might experience the same physical processes as less - dense galaxies born later , just sooner / at accelerated rates , with no additional @xmath1-dependent process necessary ( @xcite ; lc16 ) .    in such a universe , apparent quenching density thresholds would still be seen and interpreted as needing to evolve ( lc16 ; @xcite ) . yet , rather than a change in mechanism  an evolving quenching density",
    " the signal would reflect the fact that all higher - density blue galaxies have peeled - off and are thus not present in lower-@xmath9 blue populations to support the measurement . since no @xmath1 is preferred for the reddening process  which can take many gyr ( figure [ fig : densevo ] , _",
    "right_)a simple interpretation of the above is that there is no @xmath1 quenching threshold .",
    "however , the data do not rule out an evolving threshold or a long quenching timescale ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .      so far , our results favor neither density - accelerated nor density - quenched evolution . here",
    ", we perform a test that , while it does not dismiss the latter , would seem to increase the burden of proof .    figure [ fig : histograms ] , _ left _ , shows the evolution of the @xmath1 function  the absolute abundance of galaxies at a given surface density  over @xmath6 for all galaxies with @xmath36 , the @xmath37 completeness limit .",

( there can not be more descendants than progenitors . ) `` earlier '' means @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a quenching time ( defined below ) .    *",
    "if galaxies evolve strongly in @xmath1 * , then the above need not be true : previously low - density blue galaxies can compactify ( z15 ) to end - up as high - density red ones .",
    "hence , _ the density function of later red galaxies may exceed that of all earlier galaxies _ : the red population can draw progenitors from their @xmath1 bin and the increasingly large reservoir of lower - density systems .",
    "sizable overabundances of lower-@xmath9 red galaxies compared to all higher-@xmath9 , equal - density galaxies would therefore indicate compaction-/density - induced quenching .",
    "following @xcite , figure [ fig : histograms ] , _ right _ , compares the red galaxy @xmath1 functions at @xmath46 to the total density functions at @xmath47 .",
    "zero is the level expected if all galaxies in a previous interval s @xmath1 bin quenched with no inter - interval additions .",
    "( the constant introduction of blue galaxies at many @xmath1 hinders comparing the highest- and lowest-@xmath9 bins , but see below . ) under strict , constant-@xmath1 evolution , the red lines can not lie significantly above the black dashes .    at almost all densities and times , this is what is observed .",
    "while samples are small , at @xmath48-@xmath39 , red galaxies never exceed the number of older equal - density galaxies , except potentially in one of the lowest-@xmath9 bins .",
    "varying @xmath9-intervals and bin sizes , we can create @xmath49-@xmath39 tension at @xmath50 .",
    "however , if intervals are longer than a quenching time@xmath512.0 gyr ( z15)galaxies can enter the sample and quench between measurements . indeed , red galaxy abundances only exceed those of @xmath23 galaxies at @xmath52 , leaving @xmath53 gyr for this to occur .",
    "once this is accounted for [ grey dotted lines , showing @xmath54 , all tension disappears .",
    "regarding the few bins / times where any such signal is present , `` entering the sample '' could mean blue galaxies evolving at constant @xmath1 fast enough to cross the mass limit and quench without over - inflating outlier counts in the @xmath1@xmath43 relation .",
    "this channel is probably sub - dominant , but could account for tens - of - percents at the relevant masses and redshifts without invoking rapid @xmath1 evolution / quenching @xcite .",
    "_ mild _ @xmath1 growth could also account for it .",
    "though it violates the strictest null scenario , a process where @xmath55 seems distinct from density - triggered quenching ( z15 figures 2 and 3 ) . since @xmath56 red galaxies are @xmath57 twice as abundant as all @xmath23 galaxies ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath1-bin crossing rates of @xmath59 could explain the excess .",
    "this is slow compared to @xmath60 ( see also @xcite ) , except at @xmath61 , where compaction is thought to be sub - dominant for spectrophotometric reasons ( @xcite ; but cf .",
    "further , progenitors of ( e.g. ) milky way - mass objects grow by @xmath62 in @xmath43 over this interval @xcite , emphasizing mass- over @xmath1-driven quenching ( see lc16 ; discussion of figure [ fig : densevo ] above ) .",
    "although abundances match , more - detailed properties of equal-@xmath1 galaxies at various times  e.g . , @xmath27 , @xmath43might not , ruling out ( quasi-)fixed - density evolution . yet , when @xmath27 is inferred from 1d projections of the galfit models , figure [ fig : sig1check ] shows significant overlap between these quantities for earlier blue and later red galaxies at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "so , while samples are small , no strong tension emerges at the galaxy level .",
    "we thus find no requirement for dramatic changes in density / threshold - triggered quenching to explain the numbers / properties of red galaxies as a function of @xmath1 : though it may happen ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) , it is not obvious that the red population is built by blue galaxies jumping away from their peers towards anomalously high densities .",
    "amplifying @xcite  whose spectroscopy demonstrates the slow evolution of the high-@xmath1 population ",
    "and lc16whose models suggest @xmath1 trends reflect fundamentally mass- and time - dependent physics ",
    "the results above highlight the challenge of inferring causality from correlations between galaxy mass surface density and quiescence , especially as a null hypothesis of constant-@xmath1 aging also fits the facts .",
    "of course , absence of evidence is not evidence of absence .",
    "further , we do not contend that galaxies _ truly _ evolve at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath1constraints from the size  mass relation may forbid this  but that that scenario should be rejected before favoring rapid @xmath1 growth and quenching .",
    "the caveats of our analysis may provide ways forward .",
    "principally , minor mergers , adiabatic expansion , and stellar mass loss could dilute the number of observed high - density red galaxies by pushing some threshold - quenched systems back to lower @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "simulations suggest these phenomena can lower @xmath1 by @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "further , red galaxies are reported to grow by factors of @xmath645 in @xmath65 at fixed mass over the interval probed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see below ) , which would also lead to large declines in @xmath1 .",
    "yet , for these effects to hide threshold quenching and preserve the signal in figure [ fig : histograms ] , _ right _ , the timescales must match : the flow of red galaxies out of high - density bins must balance that of blue galaxies into them .",
    "indeed , since there are many more blue galaxies to move right than red ones to move left , the rates of density - reducing phenomena should be faster than ( or tuned to ) the quenching timescale .",
    "so , progenitors can not just be dense , but must grow rapidly once quenched , perhaps tripling in size  but not mass  in the 2.5 gyr between @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the general size - growth of red galaxies is measured across the entire redshift interval probed , so , in the mean , this process is too slow .",
    "moreover , the null scenario of density - accelerated aging naturally explains this as the addition of lower - density red galaxies descending at later times from lower - density blue progenitors ( figure [ fig : densevo ] ) .",
    "supporting this , @xcite find red galaxies at fixed mass to grow by @xmath68 once stellar age is accounted for .",
    "given the 0.5 dex @xmath1 bins used here , cohorts of simultaneously quenched red galaxies might thus shift one bin left , leaving our conclusions intact unless migration was a strong function of @xmath1 .    on an individual - galaxy basis , since quenching times are short at high-@xmath9 ( @xmath69 gyr at @xmath70 ) , mergers and adiabatic expansion seem unlikely to drive large density reductions : there are not enough of the former and they both take too long ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , figure 3 ) . to compensate , @xmath45 could be raised , but at @xmath71 gyr it may become difficult to disentangle @xmath1-triggered quenching from strangulation or gas exhaustion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if not seen as the aging `` agents '' in the null , fixed-@xmath1 hypothesis , these processes may be more sensitive , e.g. , to environment than @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "[ indeed , @xmath72 clusters host @xmath73 as many dense , @xmath10 galaxies as the field ( @xcite ; m16 ) , so many high-@xmath9 dense objects may inhabit regions where environmental effects are non - negligible . ]",
    "thus , rapid secular expansion seems the best out for density - triggered quenching . since @xmath74 at @xmath11 , timescales would accommodate it , and simulations suggest it is possible if star formation ends in a large burst @xcite .",
    "the mechanism seems most active at @xmath75about a dex below most high-@xmath9 red galaxies  but there is some evidence at @xmath76 and @xmath77 that the largest red systems are also the _ oldest _ while the smallest / densest are the youngest ( i.e. , poststarbursts ; @xcite ; o.  almaini , private communication ) . if confirmed using larger / deeper samples and shown not to reflect , e.g. , merger - driven rejuvenations of previously red galaxies ( i.e. , if the poststarbursts are not too dusty ) , this would be a smoking gun of compaction - triggered quenching , ruling out constant - density evolution ( but see lc16 , section 4 ) . if simulations support rapid expansion , non - structural predictions such as ages would aid observers seeking to identify candidate objects and falsify hypotheses .",
    "using the deepest hst data obtained , we show that galaxy colors , mass surface densities ( @xmath0 ) , and abundances at @xmath25 and @xmath78 are consistent with a scenario in which all systems evolve from blue to red at roughly fixed @xmath1 at rates correlated with that quantity . though it may occur , there is no requirement that blue galaxies quench by evolving dramatically in @xmath1 beyond a critical threshold . specifically",
    ":      the number of red galaxies never exceeds that of all equal-@xmath1 galaxies at earlier times ( figure [ fig : histograms ] , _ right _ ) , which also have consistent masses and central - kiloparsec densities ( figure [ fig : sig1check ] ) .",
    "there is no suggestion of a large influx of once - lower - density blue galaxies into the high - density red population .    while we can not rule out all scenarios that might mask threshold - triggered quenching ( e.g. , rapid secular expansion ) , the most straightforward ( e.g. , minor mergers ) seem unlikely given timescale requirements .",
    "thus , a simple scenario wherein galaxies evolve at roughly constant @xmath1 , which accelerates their natural aging from blue to red via gas exhaustion or other hubble - timescale processes  which are rapid at high @xmath9seems equally plausible .",
    "future investigators might falsify this / identify non - structural characteristics of galaxies undergoing threshold - triggered quenching ( e.g. , ages ) to enable observational identification and verification of the implied mechanism(s ) .",
