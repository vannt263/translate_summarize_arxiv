    "exactly solvable systems have a special status among physical models .",
    "although oversimplified in many cases , they may serve as starting point for testing the reliability of methods which can then be transferred to more realistic , but only numerically solvable models .",
    "an important class of such models are quantum systems coupled to a dissipative environment and being driven by a time - dependent external field @xcite . a wide variety of physical phenomena have been described by this kind of models , e.g.  electron @xcite and proton @xcite transfer , tunneling processes of a macroscopic spin @xcite , hydrogen tunneling in condensed phases @xcite , single defect tunneling in mesoscopic quantum wires @xcite , or tunneling of the magnetic flux in a squid @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "usually such dissipative quantum systems consist of a model hamiltonian bilinearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "additional external time dependent driving fields render the mathematical solution even more difficult or even impossible .",
    "one of the few analytically tractable time - dependent dissipative quantum systems is the parametrically driven harmonic oscillator whose analytic solution was found by zerbe and hnggi in ref .",
    "a physical realization of this model is the paul trap @xcite , which provides an oscillating quadrupole potential for the enclosed ion .",
    "furthermore , the parametrically driven dissipative harmonic oscillator may serve as a benchmark for approximation schemes which were developed for more general dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature is that the parametric driving induces a non - trivial quasienergy spectrum @xcite , in contrast to additive driving where the quasienergy spectrum coincides with the spectrum of the undriven system apart from a constant shift .",
    "this is further corroborated by the fact that the solution of the parametrically driven linear oscillator can be utilized to obtain solutions of certain nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "powerful approximative numerical procedures for simulating dissipative and possibly time - dependent quantum systems are the quantum monte carlo method @xcite and the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral algorithm ( quapi ) developed by makri and makarov @xcite .",
    "the former method works very well for problems involving path integrals in imaginary time , however , the calculation of real time path integrals is afflicted by the so called _ sign - problem _ due to the rapidly oscillating integrand .",
    "the quapi algorithm has been applied to low dimensional dissipative systems such as the driven spin-1/2-particle coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath ( driven spin - boson - system ) @xcite and to the driven double - well potential in order to study quantum hysteresis and quantum stochastic resonance @xcite . moreover",
    ", the quapi algorithm has recently been used as a basis for a very efficient memory equation algorithm for spin - boson - models @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply the quapi algorithm to the parametrically driven harmonic oscillator and to compare the results with the analytic solution from ref .",
    "@xcite . whilst harmonic oscillator systems are known to exhibit some untypical features this is",
    "not the case with respect to the quapi algorithm .",
    "our results thus show that not only intrinsically discrete models like the spin - boson - system but also _ spatially continuous _ systems can be accurately described by few energy eigenstates if the temperature is restricted to a moderate regime .",
    "most importantly , this is the first work in which the numerical approximative quapi results are compared against _ analytic _ solutions of a _ spatially continuous _ driven dissipative quantum system .",

    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ variances ] ) that @xmath166=0 , so we focus in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] on the two non - trivial variances @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the qualitative dependence of both variances on the time step @xmath118 is always similar : the deviation increases with increasing @xmath118 due to the error proportional to @xmath169 in the trotter splitting in eq .",
    "( [ split1 ] ) . for decreasing @xmath118 ,",
    "this error decreases and the  finite - k \"- error takes over .",
    "the relevant @xmath96-value on which we focus in the following is the one for which the numerical result varies the least , i.e.  the minima in the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] (  principle of minimal sensitivity \" @xcite ) .",
    "the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] confirms that for a fixed memory length @xmath170 , a smaller time step @xmath96 induces a smaller trotter - error whereas the finite - k - error remains roughly the same .",
    "while for a fixed @xmath0 ( left column in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) quapi tends to underestimate the analytic result as @xmath117 increases , a fixed @xmath117 and growing @xmath0 ( right column ) leads to an opposite trend , suggesting that indeed the analytic result will be approached best when _ both _",
    "@xmath0 _ and _ @xmath117 become large ( at a plateau @xmath96-value tending towards zero ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] depicts the time - dependence of the variances in satisfactory agreement with the analytic result .",
    "the initial jumps of @xmath162 and of @xmath163 are more pronounced in this strong damping case since the jumps are proportional to @xmath9 and @xmath164 ( see eq .",
    "( [ inistep ] ) ) .",
    "the deviations in the transient behavior are due to the assumption of a strictly ohmic classical dynamics ( infinite cut - off @xmath171 ) in the analytic solution , see the discussion at the end of section [ spddho ] .",
    "they become more pronounced for low temperatures and strong friction because this assumption induces deviations in the short - time evolution of the variances on a time - scale @xmath73 .",
    "the bath - induced long - range memory at this low temperature carries the deviations over the whole range of the transient dynamics .",
    "the fact that the memory length @xmath117 is decisive for this low temperature is confirmed by the dashed - dotted line .",
    "the dependence of the asymptotic values @xmath167 and @xmath168 on the quapi parameters is shown in fig .",
    "the number @xmath0 of basis states is not so important , while the memory length @xmath117 is decisive .",
    "again , the analytic prediction is correctly approached when both @xmath0 and @xmath117 are increased .",
    "[ fig5 ] demonstrates for a small driving amplitude reasonable agreement with the analytics .",
    "the long - memory parameter set with @xmath172 hits best the asymptotic mean value , but the oscillation amplitudes and frequencies are obtained best by the choice of a large @xmath173 . in comparison to the undriven case ( @xmath174 ) the time averaged variances are almost unchanged ( figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] ) while the time - resolved behavior ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) displays notable differences .",
    "[ fig7 ] depicts the time evolution for the relatively large driving amplitude .",
    "as expected , for strong driving , a large number @xmath0 of basis states are required to describe the oscillations correctly . the averaged asymptotic values @xmath175 and @xmath176 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . since the strong driving mixes high energy eigenstates , the results are considerably more sensitive to the choice of @xmath0 than for weak driving ( fig .   [ fig6 ] upper right panel )",
    ". however , the same argumentation applies like in the undriven case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . considering the rather extreme parameters ( small level - spacing ,",
    "strong driving , low temperature , strong damping ) the agreement with the analytic results is still satisfactory .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows @xmath177 for parameters belonging to an instability region of the mathieu oscillator ( [ mathieu ] ) @xcite , i.e.   the variances for the driven quantum harmonic oscillator diverge for long times .",
    "since the quapi algorithm is restricted to a ( finite ) @xmath0-dimensional hilbert subspace it can not reproduce such an asymptotic divergence .",
    "the last issue we address is the dependence of the dynamics on the cut - off parameter @xmath171 and on the explicit _ shape _ of the cut - off function ( [ cut1],[cut2 ] ) .",
    "first , we keep an exponential cut - off but choose a smaller cut - off frequency @xmath171 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that for the ( undriven ) quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath168 diverges with @xmath171 , while @xmath167 is asymptotically independent of @xmath171 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we choose the `` worst '' case ( i.e.  low temperature and strong damping ) without driving and decrease the cut - off to @xmath178 . compared to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the value of @xmath167 is indeed practically unchanged while @xmath168 has notably decreased .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows results for a step - like cut - off ( [ cut2 ] ) .",
    "first , we observe that mainly the short - time behavior of the relaxation process is affected .",
    "clearly , quapi with its restriction to only a few energy eigenstates can not reproduce the transient high - frequency oscillations of @xmath163 .",
    "second , we note that a step - like cut - off affects the decay of the response function @xmath33 from eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) for @xmath179 .",
    "the real / imaginary part of @xmath33 decays qualitatively like an algebraically damped cos / sin - function .",
    "while this might suggest a strong dependence of the quapi results on the memory length , we actually find a rather weak dependence since the agreement between numeric and analytic results in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] is not considerably worse than in fig .",
    "this means that the memory truncation in eq .",
    "( [ discr2 ] ) is in fact not very sensitive to the choice of the cut - off function @xmath10 as long as one is not interested in the detailed short - time behavior .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the quapi algorithm on its three numerical parameters , namely the time - step @xmath118 , the number @xmath0 of basis states , and the memory length @xmath117 . as a test system ,",
    "we have used the analytically solvable dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator and its parametrically driven generalization .",
    "the comparison shows a decent agreement of the approximative numerical result with the analytic solution , even in the case with driving .",
    "this means that a _ spatially continuous _ system can be described reasonably well by taking only a few basis states and a finite memory length into account . for low temperatures and weak - to - moderate driving",
    ", the number @xmath0 of basis states has to be chosen small and the memory length @xmath117 large , while in the opposite regime of high temperature , @xmath0 has to be large but @xmath117 may be chosen small . in both cases ,",
    "satisfactorily large @xmath0 and @xmath117 values are still numerically feasible . for strong",
    "driving , the deviations increase but the quapi results are still in qualitative agreement with the analytic predictions .",
    "our findings demonstrate the reliability of the quapi algorithm even in driven , _ spatially continuous _ systems and not only in finite , discrete dissipative quantum systems such as the spin - boson - system .",
    "therefore , the quapi algorithm may become a standard procedure for simulating open quantum systems in the presence of a novel class of time - dependent , not necessarily periodic driving fields .",
    "this technique is especially interesting for the study of decoherence in interacting two - level - systems processing quantum bits .",
