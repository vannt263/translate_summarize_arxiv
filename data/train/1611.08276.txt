    "cp violation ( cpv ) is one of the most fascinating phenomena of high energy physics and is a natural place to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "for instance , the sm is unable to account for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe , which , in thermal baryogenesis scenarios , requires cpv .",
    "new sources of cpv , however , generally modify the sm predictions for cpv in flavour - violating decays . in the case of cpv in @xmath2 ,",
    "the sm predicts a particularly strong suppression due to mass and ckm hierarchies , which imply powerful glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) cancellations .",
    "this mechanism need not apply to models of new physics . therefore kaons are particularly promising for shedding light on physics at a more fundamental level .",
    "high - precision cp - violating kaon observables offer the exciting possibility of establishing the presence of new physics ( np ) .    while cpv in @xmath3 decays was discovered 50 years ago , and direct cpv",
    " quantified by the parameter @xmath4has been firmly established for more than a decade , the theoretical treatment of the latter suffered from nonperturbative uncertainties which until very recently could not be computed in a controlled approximation .",
    "while short - distance contributions from scales @xmath5 and above have been known to next - to - leading - order in perturbation theory since the mid-1990s @xcite , the long - distance corrections , usually represented as @xmath6 matrix elements of local four - quark operators , have been for the first time determined with controlled systematics only in 2015 @xcite .",
    "this achievement , when combined with the short - distance calculations , opens the possibility of a precision theory prediction of @xmath4 .",
    "a state - of - the - art analysis at nlo within the sm @xcite gives @xmath7 ( the complex phase is very close to zero . ) this is to be contrasted with the current experimental world average based on measurements at na48 @xcite and ktev @xcite of @xmath8 the @xmath1 difference between experiment and theory could have one of several origins , the most exciting among them being a possible contribution from new particles beyond the sm .",
    "clearly , a refined sm prediction is necessary .",
    "while at the moment the error budget @xcite is dominated by the uncertainty on a single non - perturbative matrix element , this error is expected to shrink in the near future with further progress in lattice qcd .",
    "the next most important source of uncertainty at present is due to missing higher - order perturbative contributions , making nnlo accuracy imperative . in this proceedings , we preview ( partial ) results of an ongoing nnlo calculation @xcite , which roughly cut the ( total ) perturbative error in half .",
    "we further describe a renormalisation - group - invariant formalism for separating perturbative and non - perturbative effects and briefly discuss future perspectives .",
    "finally , we comment on and correct the expressions for the mixed qcd - qed renormalisation - group evolution @xcite that were presented in another talk at this conference .",
    "the key tool to disentangle the physics of the different scales ( @xmath10 and possibly @xmath11 ) is the weak effective @xmath9 hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it takes the general form @xmath12 where the process - independent wilson coefficients @xmath13 contain the physics of scales ( virtualities ) above @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , while the degrees of freedom below @xmath14 are encoded in process - dependent hadronic matrix elements of local operators @xmath16 , in the present case @xmath17 .",
    "these hadronic matrix elements are non - perturbative , and the lack of systematic predictions for them has precluded controlled predictions of @xmath4 for a long time . this bottleneck has begun to be removed by recent developments in lattice qcd , in particular by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations @xcite .",
    "several choices of the scale @xmath14 are possible .",
    "so far , the state of the art @xcite consisted of evaluating the wilson coefficients in a three - flavour ( @xmath18 ) theory , obtained by integrating out the weak scale , as well as the bottom and charm quarks .",
    "hadronic matrix elements with fully quantified systematic errors are available in the @xmath18 theory from rbc and ukqcd @xcite and agree well with earlier calculations in realistic models @xcite . in the future ,",
    "nonperturbative calculations with dynamical charm quark will likely become available , allowing to work based on a weak hamiltonian in a theory with @xmath19 quark flavours .",
    "it is convenient to split the wilson coefficients as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real and @xmath23 is the phase - convention - independent cp - violating ckm combination governing cpv in @xmath24 decays . for @xmath19 ( dynamical charm quark ) , we then have and @xmath25 instead of the traditional @xmath26 introduces a factor of 4 in the overall normalisation of the hamiltonian . ]",

    "entails nonzero values also for the `` real parts '' @xmath32 of @xmath33 .",

    "schematically , @xmath36_{ij } c_j(\\mu_w ) , \\ ] ] which is easily decomposed into expressions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the evolution operators @xmath37 resum large logarithms @xmath38 , while the matching matrices @xmath39 connect the wilson coefficients across a flavour threshold , in particular : @xmath40 the operators can be classified as current - current ( @xmath41 , @xmath31 ) , qcd penguin ( @xmath42 ) , and electroweak penguin ( @xmath43 ) . at present , all ingredients in ( [ eq : match ] ) are known to nlo accuracy ( with the exception of the dipole operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , and some of them to nnlo accuracy .",
    "the work described here completes the qcd - penguin part to nnlo , which removes about half of the current perturbative uncertainty on @xmath4 .",
    "to obtain the qcd - penguin wilson coefficients to nnlo accuracy , we require the submatrices of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath31 . we leave aside the dipole operator for the time being , which is formally suppressed by @xmath49 .",
    "the new ingredients are then related to the removal of the operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 at a scale @xmath52 , although we have recalculated the remaining , known @xcite elements of the matching matrices @xmath46 ,",
    "the anomalous dimension matrices are known from @xcite .    to determine these threshold corrections , we match green s functions with operator insertions in the @xmath53- and @xmath54-flavour theories at the matching scale @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "novel effects at nnlo include current - current operator inertions getting contributions from virtual charm / bottom - quarks and the strong coupling constant being discontinuous at the threshold scale . in our calculation",
    "we use dimensional regularization and avoid the appearance of traces over @xmath57 by employing the so - called  modern basis \" @xcite ; however this requires extra steps to connect with the `` traditional '' basis employed in the existing literature on @xmath4 , and in the lattice - qcd calculations , which is nontrivial at nnlo .",
    "we expand in the external momenta ( as appropriate for a matching onto dimension - six operators ) and set the masses of the @xmath53 light quarks to zero .",
    "after renormalisation , the @xmath54-flavour result still contains infrared divergences in the form of poles in @xmath58 , which have to be reproduced in the @xmath53-flavour theory .",
    "as the green s functions in the @xmath53-flavour theory contain only massless tadpole loop diagrams ( after expansion in the external momenta ) , they are given entirely in terms of the ultraviolet counterterms in the @xmath53-flavour theory , which are related to known anomalous dimensions .",
    "the cancellation of divergences constitutes an important check of our calculation . in the end , the matching results in finite threshold corrections for the wilson coefficients @xmath59_{ij } c_j^{(n_f+1)}(\\mu).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "physical observables can not depend on the dimensional renormalisation scale @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the @xmath14-dependence has to cancel between the wilson coefficients @xmath13 and matrix elements @xmath60 order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "however , in the present case the matrix elements are found from non - perturbative calculations and their explicit @xmath14-dependence is not known . instead , we can verify explicitly that our wilson coefficients @xmath13 satisfy the nnlo renormalisation - group equations up to @xmath61 remainder terms , which they do .",
    "however , this still does not allow to give an estimate of the impact of missing higher - order perturbative corrections , part of which are contained in the published lattice - qcd matrix elements and inseparable from the non - perturbative uncertainties from dynamics at scales @xmath62 .    to allow for a full separation of scales , we note that the evolution operator @xmath37 in fact factorizes , @xmath63 where @xmath64 @xmath65 is just the leading - order evolution operator , with the usual ratio @xmath66 replaced by @xmath67 .    we can then define the following object appearing in the intermediate stages in our calculation : @xmath68 note that the matrix @xmath69 contains _ all _ the dependence on the scale @xmath70 in the expression ( [ eq : match ] ) for the wilson coefficient , and depends on no other scales . as a consequence , it must by itself be independent of the renormalisation scale .",
    "the way our calculation is set up , we obtain the matching matrix with dependence on both @xmath71 and on @xmath72 . expressing @xmath73 in terms of @xmath74 and taking into account both the explicit @xmath14-dependence and the @xmath14-dependence of the quark mass appearing in the matching , we observe that the scale dependence cancels , up to terms of order @xmath61 .",
    "the residual @xmath14-dependence , which is of order @xmath75 , gives a complete estimate of higher - order effects at the threshold @xmath70 .",
    "we find that these residual scale dependences are at the percent level and that the value of @xmath0 is only mildly shifted when going from nlo to nnlo .",
    "this points to an excellent behaviour of the perturbation series not only at the scale @xmath76 , but also at the scale @xmath77 .",
    "this means at least for the dominant contribution the perturbation theory seems to work .",
    "our results are best expressed in terms of renormalisation - group and scheme - independent wilson coefficients and matrix elements , @xmath78 note that we have not suppressed any @xmath14-dependence : each hatted object is separately scale- and scheme - independent , @xmath79 and @xmath80 under a change of scheme and the resulting scheme cancellation can be found in ref.@xcite . ] .",
    "for this reason , relating the `` modern '' basis to the `` traditional '' basis is trivial at the level of the hatted objects .",
    "perturbative uncertainties are fully contained in the hatted coefficients , while non - perturbative uncertainties reside in the hatted matrix elements .",
    "the two matching steps together with rg evolution are then expressed as @xmath81 for dynamical charm , one simply removes the last matching step .    in fact",
    ", the hatted hadronic matrix elements could in principle be obtained nonperturbatively on the lattice , obviating or reducing the need to resort to technically demanding lattice - continuum matching .",
    "if this is not done , the resultant extra `` perturbative '' uncertainty may be considered as part of the lattice error budget .",
    "lattice computations of the relevant matrix elements for the analysis of @xmath0 are currently performed only in the isospin limit ( @xmath82 , degenerate masses ) , and the standard - model prediction is based on the following expression @xmath83 \\ , , \\label{eq : cpvsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is accurate up to @xmath84 corrections .",
    "here @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) are the amplitudes for the two isospin states with their strong phases @xmath87 removed . the latter , as well as the phase @xmath88 and magnitude @xmath89of @xmath90 and the isospin ratio @xmath91 are all determined from experimental data .",
    "the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 are a ( partial ) parameterization of corrections to the isospin limit , with values computed in chiral perturbation theory in @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the ratios @xmath94 is the central ingredient to the theory prediction of @xmath0 and the formalism used for their determination is explained in reference @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath95 are completely dominated by the two operators @xmath41 .",
    "( @xmath96 . )",
    "operator identities among the @xmath97 operators imply that the ratios @xmath98 where in the numerators only the terms involving the @xmath97 operators are kept , are almost free from hadronic uncertainties . the factor @xmath99 in eq.([eq : a0vma ] )",
    "is given in terms of the current - current wilson coefficients and operators , @xmath100 .",
    "the small ratio @xmath101 implies that only a modest accuracy is needed on the hadronic matrix elements entering the isospin-0 ratio through @xmath99 .",
    "the term @xmath102 also involves a small wilson coefficient , which moreover multiplies a colour - suppressed hadronic matrix element .",
    "conversely , the contributions coming from the @xmath103 operators are very sensitive to long - distance effects ( hadronic matrix elements ) . to minimize the nonperturbative uncertainties ,",
    "one notes that @xmath104 govern cp - conserving @xmath105 decays and are well determined by data .",
    "one then has @xmath106 again , the omitted terms are suppressed by small wilson coefficients and/or colour - suppressed operator matrix elements . as a result ,",
    "the prediction for @xmath4 involves predominantly two hadronic matrix elements ( often parameterised in terms of parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , as well as perturbative wilson coefficients @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "our new calculation essentiall removes the perturbative uncertainty on @xmath111 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath109 are already tiny , leaving @xmath112 and an improved treatment of isospin - breaking corrections as the main objectives for the future .",
    "note that using @xmath104 from data also in the @xmath97 operators introduces dependence on ( mainly ) the matrix element of the operator @xmath113 , and its wilson coefficient , and should be avoided .",
    "this is the main reason why the prediction of @xcite is more accurate than that of rbc and ukqcd , and leads to a more pronounced tension with the data , in spite of employing the same nonperturbative matrix elements and including an error estimate for isospin - breaking corrections .",
    "the experimental data for @xmath0 is in mild tension with the sm .",
    "this conclusion is possible because of recent progress in lattice qcd , which has reduced the ( still dominant ) uncertainties on long - distance non - perturbative contributions . with further progress expected in the near future ,",
    "currently subleading uncertainties , most importantly higher - order perturbative short - distance contributions , will start to dominate .",
    "we have described a calculation at nnlo accuracy of the short - distance contributions to the qcd penguin amplitudes , sufficient to achieve nnlo accuracy on the isospin - zero @xmath114 decay amplitude ratio .",
    "our results leave the central value of the theoretical prediction nearly unchanged , while greatly reducing the perturbative uncertainty on this piece , leaving unknown nnlo corrections to the @xmath115 amplitude ratio to dominate the perturbative uncertainty on @xmath4 , at about half the previous nlo error .",
    "several further steps will be needed before the theoretical uncertainty matches the experimental one , and perhaps a discrepancy with the sm can be confirmed .",
    "one of them is the computation of the @xmath115 amplitude ratio to nnlo accuracy .",
    "another is a better treatment of isospin - breaking corrections , and electromagnetic corrections in particular .",
    "the latter affect both the wilson coefficients and the hadronic matrix elements , and require both perturbative and lattice calculations , as well as a consistent interfacing of the two .",
