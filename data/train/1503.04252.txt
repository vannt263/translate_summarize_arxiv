    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) exhibit a wide diversity in their light curves and spectral properties , and it remains an enduring challenge to connect these properties to the evolution of their progenitors .",
    "prior to 2009 , fourteen ccsn progenitor stars or progenitor outbursts ( eight sne  ii - p , three iib , one iin , one ibn , and one ii - pec ) had been detected in pre - explosion images . over the last few years ,",
    "at least six more ( iin : 1961v , 2009ip , 2010jl ; iib : 2011dh , 2013df ; iin - p : 2011ht ) have been found @xcite .",
    "detection of these progenitors is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the observed sn diversity .",
    "some theoretical models for the end stages of massive - star evolution suggest that stars with @xmath560m@xmath6 will collapse to form a black hole without a sn explosion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of what seem to be massive luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) as the progenitors of the type iin sne 1961v @xcite , 2005gl @xcite , 2009ip @xcite , and 2010jl @xcite , however , challenge this notion .",
    "optical spectra of sne  iin exhibit prominent , relatively narrow hydrogen emission lines which arise from the interaction of the expanding sn debris with a recently ejected circumstellar shell that is typically moving at @xmath7 km @xmath8 . because these lines appear soon after the sn explosion",
    ", it is expected that the shell of circumstellar matter ( csm ) was ejected by the star within a few years before the sn explosion itself .",
    "such pre - sn eruptions in the years just before the sn suggest that instabilities arise during the late stages of nuclear burning @xcite to power mass - loss episodes that might result in a detectable brightening of the progenitor system .",
    "in fact , there have already been a few direct detections of pre - sn outbursts : sn 2006jc ( ibn ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , sn 2009ip ( iin ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , sn 2011ht ( iin - p ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and arguably sn 1961v ( iin ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus strengthening the theoretical connection between lbvs and sne  iin .",
    "even when no direct detection has been made , inferred wind and mass - loss parameters , strong infrared excesses at late times @xcite , and a theoretical connection to quasi - periodic radio modulations suggest that lbv - like progenitors are likely for some sne  iin .",
    "@xcite estimate that @xmath9 of sne  iin in their palomar transient factory ( ptf ) data have pre - explosion outbursts brighter than @xmath10 , though some of these pre - peak brightening events may actually be the sn explosion itself ( this is discussed more in  [ sec : rvb ] ) .",
    "recent work suggests that sne  iin follow lbv - like eruptions , although it remains unclear if the driving instability of the pre - sn eruptions is the same as the instability of classical lbvs . in the context of stellar evolution , lbvs were suggested to be a transitional phase between o - type stars and wolf - rayet stars that skipped a red supergiant phase .",
    "giant eruptions , occurring when a massive star increases its bolometric luminosity @xcite , were included in the lbv phenomenon . by spatially resolving the circumstellar shells resulting from two such lbv outbursts within our own galaxy ( p cygni and @xmath1 carinae ) ,",
    "studies have been able to measure the amount of mass lost in observed lbv giant eruptions .",
    "estimates of p cygni s circumstellar shell from the 1600 ad outburst total only about 0.1m@xmath6 @xcite , whereas estimates of @xmath1 carinae s shell from its mid-19th century outburst total around 1020m@xmath6 @xcite . while other galactic lbvs have been observed with csm shells surrounding them @xcite , only these two events",
    "were actually observed during the eruptions that produced their csm shells .",
    "a number of recent developments have challenged the traditional view of lbvs , including evidence of shock - powered events rather than super - eddington winds @xcite , light - echo spectra that do not match expectations for winds @xcite , and a widening range of initial masses that experience outbursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that lbvs tend to be more isolated than o - type stars and even wolf - rayet stars , challenging the idea that they are in transition between these two phases .",
    "instead , @xcite propose that they may be the late evolutionary stage of mass gainers or mergers in binary systems . finally , as noted above",
    ", the discovery of a number of lbvs exploding as ccsne without first experiencing a relatively long ( @xmath11my ) wolf - rayet phase also challenges the traditional view of lbvs .    in this paper",
    ", we further explore the connection between lbvs and sne  iin by searching for additional progenitor outbursts preceding the sne  iin .",
    "the data were acquired starting in 1998 as part of the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) with the 0.76 m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "kait began automatic operation and discovered its first sn in 1997 @xcite .",
    "while the program was primarily focused on the determination of sn rates @xcite and sne  ia for use as cosmological probes @xcite , the kait database includes pre - sn images and sn photometry of many sn events that can be utilised for other purposes @xcite .",
    "sn 1997bs , the first object that kait discovered with a sn designation , was interpreted as not being a sn at all , and became a prototype for the class of `` sn imposters '' @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite , however , raises some additional questions about whether or not this was a terminal explosion .",
    "the discussion of sn iin progenitors has intensified because of the recent discovery of erupting progenitor systems like sn 2009ip @xcite .    here",
    "we aim to constrain the frequency and luminosity of such outbursts .",
    "information about the kait / loss program and the targets selected for our study is presented in  [ sec : obs ] .",

    "s total field of view is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "typical integration times for kait span the range of 1640s . during much of the time since 1998 ,",
    "kait has monitored roughly 15,000 galaxies at redshifts @xmath17 in search of transients .",
    "over 1200 galaxies can be observed in a single long winter night ( but fewer than 800 in a short summer night ) , resulting in a cadence of roughly 310 days for most targets ( excluding the portion of the year that the target can not be observed because it is in the daytime or bright twilight sky ) .",
    "these transient candidates go through a process of being automatically compared to template images and flagged , verified by human checkers , and then reobserved the following night before a sn is announced @xcite .",
    "reduction and processing of the kait images was performed using techniques described by @xcite .",
    "bias corrections and flatfielding are automatically performed at the telescope for each target . the primary template image used for alignment and galaxy subtraction",
    "was obtained as part of the routine observation program on a photometric night with a longer exposure time than the typical images ( usually 40s as opposed to 1630s ) .",
    "a deep template with the sn present was generated using all images up to one year after the sn explosion that were of high quality and still contained the sn event as verified visually after galaxy subtraction .",
    "this deep sn template was used to provide precise astrometry of the sn for the later analysis using artificial star injection .",
    "we obtained astrometric solutions for our primary template image by uploading our image to astrometry.net @xcite .",
    "we then applied these astrometric solutions to the data images after they were aligned with the template image .",
    "the iraf tasks ` phot ` , ` psf ` ( on one of the brightest stars away from the galaxy or edge of the image ) , and ` allstar ` in the daophot package provided aperture and point - spread - function ( psf ) photometry for all of our images .",
    "we calibrated the measured magnitudes to known magnitudes for any stars also present in the usno - b database , which has rather large uncertainties of about 0.25 mag @xcite .",
    "we performed image subtraction using the ` hotpants ` program , after which we could use the daophot package ` addstar ` task to inject artificial stars .",
    "the ` phot ` task was used again to measure the photometry of the artificial stars and confirm that these artificial stars in fact matched the known magnitudes that we inserted .",
    "we combined our images by using the ` imcombine ` task in iraf in average mode when needed .",
    "the combined images were often cropped in order to obtain an intersection of our data that excluded regions which only contained data from a number of images less than the total in the stack .      from the large sample of kait - observed sne , we first selected all sne  iin , candidate sne  iin , and sne  ii as classified in the iau central bureau of astronomical telegrams ( cbat ) list of sne .",
    "we then restricted this sample to targets within 50 mpc because kait images having a limiting apparent magnitude of @xmath18 result in an absolute magnitude of @xmath19 at this distance ( neglecting reddening ) .",
    "this is the peak luminosity of @xmath1 carinae s 19th - century eruption to which we compare the progenitor outburst limiting magnitudes , and it is a typical value for sn imposters ( although they exhibit a wide range ; * ? ? ?",
    "the classification of the objects in the iau cbat list of sne is usually based on the first announcement published , but these are often revised upon further study .",
    "accordingly , we checked the literature for each of our targets to verify that they were indeed sne  iin .",
    "overall , this selection process provided us with five unambiguous sne  iin and one ambiguous sn  iin / sn imposter ( sn 2006am ) .",
    "figure [ fig : snimages ] shows stacked images of each sn field with the sn location labeled .",
    "table [ tab : sntargets ] enumerates many of the important properties of each of the targets . in all but one case ( sn 1999el ) ,",
    "use of hubble s law was the only method available for distance determination for our targets .",
    "we obtain these redshift - based distances from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , which assumes @xmath20 @xcite and takes into account influences from the virgo cluster , the great attractor , and the shapley supercluster .",
    "extinction along the line of sight to each sn s host galaxy due to the milky way was applied @xcite .",
    "extinction produced in the host galaxies themselves is not known for any of our targets . since these sne",
    "iin show signs of prior mass loss resulting in csm , it is possible that the progenitors were enshrouded in dusty csm that was destroyed by the sn .",
    "our limiting magnitudes do not account for this possible additional extinction .",
    "+     +        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because of the brightness of the host galaxies at the location of sn 2010jl and sn 2008fq , the limiting magnitudes are too bright to place a strong constraint on the potential presence of pre - sn outbursts . however , the other four sne have reasonable ( @xmath21 ) fractional coverage rates for most of the example outbursts , with particularly high ( @xmath22 ) coverage rates for sn 2009ip - like burst # 3 simulations . considering that we have no",
    "limiting magnitudes for a large portion of the year owing to right - ascension constraints , any coverage rate near 0.5 is high .    even though we have the highest fractional coverage rates for sn 2009ip - like burst # 3 , we focus more on the other outbursts in this discussion because this event ( 2012a ) is likely to be the sn explosion itself , which is initially faint because of having a bsg progenitor @xcite , as was the case for sn 1987a .",
    "our next most prominent outburst is that of @xmath1 car - like burst # 2 ( 1843 ) , which shows rates above 17% for all of our objects , excluding sn 2010jl and sn 2008fq .",
    "if all of the sne  iin in our sample had gone through @xmath1 car - like burst # 2 phases within their recent histories , then we would have an 88% chance of detecting at least one outburst from the six targets .",
    "even for sn 2009ip - like burst # 2 , the faintest and shortest duration outburst , we find a 64% chance of having detected at least one outburst among all of our events .",
    "these calculations are heavily dependent on the fact that we ignore local extinction by circumstellar dust ( though sn 2009ip and @xmath1 carinae may have been surrounded by dust as well ) .",
    "we consider the possibility of circumstellar dust enshrouding our targets by adding the effects of artificial extinction to the example outbursts and recalculating the coverage rates .",
    "we find that with just @xmath23 , the probability that we would have detected at least one outburst from any of our targets similar to that of sn 2009ip s burst # 2 drops below 10% .",
    "thus , it may be that the majority of sn  iin precursors are somewhat less luminous intrinsically than sn 2009ip or @xmath1 carinae , or that they appear fainter because of a modest amount of dust that formed in a previous eruption .",
    "the dust formed by precursor eruptions may be destroyed by the sn explosion .",
    "because of this , we can not use measurements of reddening along the line of sight to sne to rule out extinction effects on the progenitor systems due to csm dust .      in order to further constrain the types of outbursts , we compute fractional coverage rates ( the chance that we would have detected a given outburst if it had occurred on any random day since the start of our observations for the sn in question ) for simulated outbursts with a variety of parameters , for limiting magnitudes set by both the artificial star and background noise techniques for all of our sn  iin targets .",
    "the results of these tests are shown in figures [ fig : simip ] and [ fig : simeta ] .",
    "we simulate outbursts similar to those from sn 2009ip ( many short outbursts ) and @xmath1 carinae ( less frequent but extended outbursts ) over a range of magnitudes .",
    "specifically , in the case of sn 2009ip - like outbursts , we simulate ten - day light curves which vary in peak magnitude between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and recur between one and ten times in a particular simulation . in the case of many repeated outbursts ,",
    "the separation between events is set to ten days .",
    "for instance , a five - event sn 2009ip - like light curve at @xmath26mag uses five separate outburst events that are ten days long at a constant magnitude of @xmath27 with ten days separating each of the five outburst events . in the case of @xmath1 carinae - like outbursts ,",
    "we simulate a single light curve which varies in magnitude between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and duration of the outburst between ten and one hundred days .",
    "note here that the sn 2008fq and sn 2010jl fractional coverage rates are diminished when the artificial star limiting magnitudes are used because of high host - galaxy brightness in the signal flux aperture .",
    "the remainder of the fractional coverage rates are quite high ( @xmath28 ) for almost all cases plotted with @xmath29 .",
    "the kait cadence of 310 days is sufficient for the purposes of this project , as can be seen from the varying duration of outburst plots in figure [ fig : simeta ] . as the duration of the outbursts decreases ,",
    "the fractional coverage rates drop slowly compared to the steep dropoffs seen in the other plots .",
    "this slow drop is primarily caused by the fact that our limiting magnitudes only cover the @xmath30 of the year during which we have data , so that longer outbursts spend less time in our `` blind spots . ''",
    "our main point is that the fractional coverage rates become very small for @xmath31 , indicating that kait survey data are not sensitive enough to place constraints on outbursts fainter than this level . because the sn 2009ip and @xmath1 carinae light curves spend most of their quiescent time at @xmath32 or @xmath33 ( respectively ) , such sensitivity levels are necessary to thoroughly constrain the frequency of their outbursts .",
    "although it had been speculated for some time that red supergiants ( rsgs ) were the most likely progenitors of sne  ii , evidence has suggested that some sne  ii may explode while in a bsg or lbv phase .",
    "the most famous of such bsg progenitors is sn 1987a @xcite , but more recent cases associated with sne iin have been suggested as well @xcite . the key difference between a rsg and a bsg progenitor is the larger photospheric radius for a rsg progenitor . because exploded stars with larger initial radii lose less thermal energy to adiabatic expansion , their sne can achieve a higher initial peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "whereas the rsg s light curve essentially plateaus from this peak , a bsg s light curve will continue to rise from its initially faint state as @xmath34 decay begins to dominate , as in the example of sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "interaction with csm can also greatly increase the luminosity from a bsg ( or any ) explosion depending on the delay between the explosion time and the onset of strong csm interaction ( see @xcite ) , but in this section we are concerned with the rise to peak brightness of the sn - ejecta photosphere . since lbv progenitors to sne  iin are expected to have bsg - like radii , we can look for these signatures in the light curve to constrain progenitor properties .",
    "sn 2009ip and sn 2010mc are strong candidates for having relatively compact bsgs prior to explosion ( compact , at least , compared to a rsg of a similar luminosity ) . because an abundance of data exists for both the sn explosion itself and the many outbursts in the preceding years",
    ", sn 2009ip s light curve is used as a general template to explore our ability to constrain the progenitors for the sne  iin studied in this work .",
    "given that some of our sne  iin have limiting magnitudes set shortly before they reached peak brightness , we can use these limits to constrain how quickly the light curve rose in each case . for brevity , we refer to an initially faint bsg sn light curve as an 09ip/2012a - like event .",
    "sn 1999el , sn 2003dv , sn 2006am , and sn",
    "2008fq have relevant data for this question .",
    "figure [ fig : fourfig ] shows zoomed - in light curves for these sne near their times of peak brightness . with data ending just 14 days before peak ,",
    "sn 1999el shows strong signs that it did not have a faint 09ip/2012a - like event prior to reaching its peak brightness .",
    "data for sn 2003dv are earlier relative to the peak , but do span an effective range of 36 to 75 days prior to the peak brightness , suggesting a possible quick rise to peak as well .",
    "one limit is set 20 days before peak for sn 2003dv , but the noise level is too high to conclusively rule out a 09ip/2012a - like event .",
    "sn 2006am also has limits 25 and 39 days before its observed peak ( because we have so few data for the sn 2006am light curve , we do not know for certain that we actually have near - peak observations for this event ) , but the 25-day limit is from a poor - quality image and does not significantly constrain the sn brightness .",
    "the observation 39 days prior to peak brightness does suggest that no detectable source at @xmath35 was present at that time , but this alone does not rule out a 09ip/2012a - like event for sn 2006am .",
    "pre - sn data near peak for sn 2008fq span a range of 16135 days prior to the sn explosion , three of which seem to suggest a light curve fainter than that of sn 2009ip as it rose to peak .",
    "however , the majority of the limiting magnitudes are too bright to stringently constrain the rise to peak for sn 2008fq .",
    "this is a direct consequence of its being far away at 47.4 mpc and being located near the brightest part of its host galaxy .",
    "because sn 1999el and sn 2003dv do not seem to have had a faint pre - peak sn bump , it is unlikely that their progenitors were bsgs akin to sn 2009ip and sn 2010mc .",
    "instead , these sne underwent a quick rise to peak that would be expected from a rsg progenitor , or perhaps from a bsg with immediate onset of strong csm interaction . for sn 2010jl and sn 2011a",
    ", we can not place any constraints in this manner because no data are available within 150 days prior to peak brightness , but we do know that _ hst _ images for sn 2010jl suggest a possible bsg progenitor @xcite .",
    "we must also consider sne  iin - p and their progenitors here because a sn  iin - p may appear as a sn  iin if no data are available to rule out a plateau phase .",
    "hence , we can not exclude the possibility that some of our sne  iin are in fact sne  iin - p .",
    "this is important because sne  iin - p are hypothesised to arise from super asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars which explode as electron - capture sne , as in the case of sn 1994w , sn 2009kn , sn 2011ht , and the crab nebula s sn @xcite .",
    "sn 2011ht was reported to have an outburst one year prior to its terminal explosion @xcite , suggesting that super - agb stars may also produce nonterminal eruptive mass - loss events just before exploding .",
    "the population of events that appear as sne  iin may therefore have a diversity of progenitors from rsgs to bsgs rather than a single progenitor system @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite , which looked at a sample of sixteen sne  iin in palomar transient factory ( ptf ) data , claims that more than 50% of sne  iin have at least one pre - explosion outburst brighter than @xmath36 ( absolute magnitude @xmath37 ) that occurs within 4 months before the sn .",
    "this statistical estimate includes two events ( sn 2010mc precursor 20 days before , and the ptf 12cxj - a precursor 10 days before ) that occur just prior to the sn peak brightness , but are very similar to the 09ip/2012a precursor that occurred just 25 days before peak brightness .",
    "@xcite showed that the light curves of sn 2010mc and sn 2009ip are almost identical .",
    "these `` precursors '' may well be the initial stages of the slowly rising sn explosion itself before csm interaction peaks , as was the case for sn 2009ip @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , it seems that detectable luminous eruptions ( @xmath38 ) may be less common among sn  iin progenitors just before explosion than the 50% estimate by @xcite .",
    "our constraints on sn 2009ip - like and @xmath1 carinae - like eruptions suggest that these more luminous eruptive events are uncommon , or that they are fainter than our example outbursts ( intrinsically or owing to possible dust extinction ) .",
    "in fact , we find that our data require that @xmath39 of sne  iin have pre - sn lbv - like eruptions of @xmath24 mag or brighter in the time frame covered by kait .",
    "our primary goal was to search through the kait archival database in order to constrain the properties of sn  iin progenitor outbursts by determining if any sne  iin exhibit detectable outburst characteristics similar to those of sn 2009ip or @xmath1 carinae .",
    "no such outbursts were statistically detected in the dataset , implying that they are either typically less luminous than expected or are not common among sne  iin .",
    "instead , we have provided limiting magnitudes for six sn  iin progenitors .    with these limiting magnitudes ,",
    "we are able to place constraints on the nature of a few of the progenitors to our sne  iin .",
    "in particular , we find that sn 1999el and sn 2003dv have constraining limiting magnitudes set within 40 days prior to their peak brightness , suggesting that they are likely rsgs with steeply rising light curves or that csm interaction turned on much more quickly than the delayed interaction in sn 2009ip and sn 2010mc .",
    "we also find that if the sn 2009ip and @xmath1 carinae outbursts were typical of all sne  iin , then we would have a good chance ( @xmath40 ) of detecting each given type of outburst at least once in our dataset .",
    "however , this is for an emerged luminosity corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "this estimate ignores the possibility that these objects ( as well as sn 2009ip and @xmath1 carinae ) are in fact obscured by their own csm dust , which is likely to be created if there have been previous such mass - loss episodes .",
    "it also depends somewhat on our particular viewing angle for each sn if the csm geometry is aspherical @xcite .    in order to better",
    "study the nature of sne  iin and their progenitors , it would be beneficial to perform surveys with deeper limiting magnitudes .",
    "the kait cadence of 310 days provides excellent temporal coverage of the outbursts we are exploring , while the ( up to ) 12yr baseline of archival data provides nearly unparalleled temporal extent for such a project .",
    "however , the sensitivity of kait only allows us to reach limiting magnitudes of @xmath42 , which restricts us to sne  iin within 50mpc .",
    "any objects at larger distances than this are difficult to constrain because they would likely be too faint for kait upper limits to be meaningful .",
    "for example , we searched for pre - sn outbursts in sn 2006gy .",
    "although we detected no pre - sn outbursts , the upper limit of @xmath43 at @xmath44mpc is not very constraining .",
    "ideally , a survey geared toward detecting sn  iin progenitor outbursts should strive to achieve a limiting magnitude of @xmath45 in order to be able to reach sensitivities of @xmath46 out to 50mpc . the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) project aims to reach @xmath47mag limits in stacked images ( mag 24 in single 15s exposures ) . at this level of sensitivity",
    ", we could measure the progenitors to these sne  iin in their relatively quiescent states if they are as luminous as sn 2009ip or @xmath1 carinae out to @xmath48mpc , but variability is needed to pick them out of the confusion - limited background . if these objects are not detected by such a survey , then it is likely they are being obscured by circumstellar dust , in which case an infrared survey would be interesting .",
    "even so , deeper optical surveys would allow us to statistically compare the number of sne  iin that arise from objects that undergo tremendous mass loss just prior to explosion .",
    "this research , based on data from the lick observatory supernova search that took many years to acquire , was completed after the untimely and tragic death of our close friend , colleague , and coauthor weidong li , who led the nightly operation of kait ( 19972011 ) and conducted numerous scientific studies with it ; we miss him dearly .",

    "<S> no progenitor outbursts are found using the false discovery rate ( fdr ) statistical method in any of our targets . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we derive limiting magnitudes ( lms ) at the locations of the sne . </S>",
    "<S> these limiting magnitudes ( typically reaching @xmath0 ) are compared to outbursts of sn 2009ip and @xmath1 car , plus additional simulated outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the data for sn 1999el and sn 2003dv are of sufficient quality to rule out events @xmath2 days before the main peak caused by initially faint sne from blue supergiant ( bsg ) precursor stars , as in the cases of sn 2009ip and sn 2010mc . </S>",
    "<S> these sne  iin may thus have arisen from red supergiant progenitors , or they may have had a more rapid onset of circumstellar matter interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the probability of detecting at least one outburst in our dataset to be @xmath3 for each type of the example outbursts , so the lack of any detections suggests that such outbursts are either typically less luminous ( intrinsically or owing to dust ) than @xmath4 , or not very common among sne  iin within a few years prior to explosion .
