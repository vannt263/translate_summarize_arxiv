    "the principle underlying most of the slow - light experiments is to exploit the steep normal dispersion of the refractive index associated with a pronounced peak in the transmission of the medium and the correlative reduction of the group velocity .",
    "the situation where the resulting time - delay of the light - pulse is large compared to its duration and can be controlled by an external laser field is of special importance for potential applications , especially in the domain of high - speed all - optical signal - processing .",
    "harris and his co - workers @xcite opened the way to such experiments by exploiting the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) allowing one to create a narrow transparency - window in an otherwise optically thick atomic vapour . using a true - shape detection of the pulses",
    ", they demonstrated propagation velocities as slow as @xmath0 and group delays @xmath1 as long as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the velocity of the light in vacuum and the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the intensity - profile of the incident pulse .",
    "much slower velocities have been attained in subsequent eit experiments ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) and in experiments involving coherent population oscillations @xcite or other processes to induce a transparency - window in an absorbing medium .",
    "it is however worth noticing that only few of these experiments , all using eit , have succeeded in giving _",
    "direct _ demonstrations of fractional delays @xmath5 exceeding unity @xcite .",
    "theoretical discussions on the maximum time - delays attainable in such experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "a different way to achieve a system with a controllable transmission - peak is to optically induce a resonant gain in a transparent medium @xcite .",
    "initially proposed by gauthier @xcite , the arrangement involving stimulated brillouin scattering @xcite seems particularly attractive from the viewpoint of the above mentioned applications .",
    "the brillouin gain is indeed directly implemented on an optical fibre and there are no severe constraints in the choice of the operating wavelength .",
    "the group delay @xmath1 has already been controlled on a range of @xmath6 by this technique @xcite .",
    "note that preliminary experiments using a raman fibre amplifier have also been achieved @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to provide analytical results on the propagation of arbitrarily shaped pulses , the central frequency of which coincides with that of a pronounced maximum in the medium - transmission .",
    "we examine more specifically the case where the resulting time - delays of the pulses are large compared to their duration .",
    "our study applies in particular but not exclusively to the above mentioned systems .",
    "our approach follows in part and extends that of bukhman @xcite with a special attention paid to the connection of the theoretical results with the experiments .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the slowly - varying envelopes of the incident and transmitted pulses and by @xmath9 and @xmath10 their fourier transforms .",
    "the slow - light medium is characterised by its impulse response @xmath11 or by its transfer function @xmath12 , fourier transform of @xmath11 .",
    "the input / output relation or transfer equation reads @xmath13 in the time - domain or @xmath14 in the frequency - domain @xcite .",
    "we assume that the incident pulse has a finite energy , that it is not chirped ( @xmath7 real and positive ) and that @xmath11 is also real .",
    "the local response of the medium is characterised by the complex gain - factor @xmath15 $ ] whose real part @xmath16 and imaginary part @xmath17 are respectively the logarithm of the medium amplitude - gain @xmath18 and the induced phase shift .",
    "the condition imposed to @xmath11 implies that @xmath19 and thus that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively even and odd functions of @xmath20 .",
    "this has the advantage of eliminating the lowest - order pulse - distortions resulting from the gain - slope and from the group velocity dispersion at the frequency @xmath21 of the optical carrier ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "moreover the medium is then entirely characterised by the single real function @xmath11 . in order to have simple expressions we use for @xmath7 a time origin located at the pulse centre - of - gravity and for @xmath8 a time origin retarded by the transit time at the group velocity outside the frequency - domain of high - dispersion ( local time picture ) .",
    "the time delays considered hereafter are thus only those originating in the high - dispersion region .",
    "general properties of the transmitted pulse can be derived by fourier analysis .",
    "let @xmath23 be any of the real functions @xmath7 , @xmath11 or @xmath8 and @xmath24 its fourier transform .",
    "we remark that @xmath25 and , following an usual procedure in probability theory @xcite , we characterise @xmath24 by its cumulants @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 for @xmath12 , we see that the cumulants are simply related to the coefficients of the series expansion of @xmath28 in powers of @xmath29 and , in particular , that @xmath30 coincides with the group delay @xmath31 .",
    "we incidentally recall that , due to the causality principle , @xmath1 can be related to the gain profile @xcite . within our assumptions ,",
    "this relation reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the amplitude - gain of the medium at the frequency of the optical carrier .",
    "this confirms that large group delays are achieved when the gain @xmath18 has a pronounced maximum at @xmath22 .",
    "we have then @xmath34 .",
    "coming back to the general problem , we characterise the time function @xmath23 by its area @xmath35 and its three lowest order moments , namely the mean value @xmath36 , the variance @xmath37 and the @xmath38 order centred moment @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath41 ) the location of the centre - of - gravity ( resp .",
    "the _ rms _ duration ) of the function @xmath42 ) .",
    "its asymmetry may be characterised by the dimensionless parameter @xmath43 , the so - called skewness @xcite . for a gaussian function , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fwhm of the energy profile @xmath46 .",
    "an important result @xcite is that the moments @xmath40 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 of @xmath23 are equal to the cumulants @xmath49 and @xmath50 of @xmath24 .",
    "moreover the transfer equation immediately leads to the relations @xmath51 and @xmath52 where , as in all our paper , the indexes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the absence of index respectively refer to the incident pulse , the transmitted pulse and the transfer - function or impulse response of the medium . with our choice of time origin , @xmath55 . by combining the previous results ,",
    "we finally obtain the four equations @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the studies of the linear pulse propagation ,",
    "the first equation which relates the areas of the transmitted and incident pulses is known as the area theorem @xcite .",
    "the second equation expresses that the time - delay of the pulse centre - of - gravity equals the group delay @xcite .",
    "the two last ones specify how the _ rms _ duration and the asymmetry of the incident pulse are modified by the medium .",
    "all these results are valid provided that the involved moments are finite @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain a complete information on the shape and the amplitude of the transmitted pulse , we obviously have to specify the complex gain - factor @xmath28 of the medium . for the medium with a resonant gain , it reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the normalised complex profile of the gain - line ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 is the gain parameter for the intensity @xcite and @xmath64 stands for the attenuation introduced to reduce the effects of the amplified spontaneous emission @xcite and/or to normalise the overall gain of the system .",

    ", we actually retrieve the expression of @xmath28 obtained for a gain medium . in both types of experiments , @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "are generally comparable in order that the resonance gain @xmath73 is close to 1 or , at least , does not differ too strongly from 1 . anyway",
    "the intensity - transmission on resonance exceeds its value far from resonance by the factor @xmath74 .    to go beyond",
    ", it seems necessary to explicit the profile @xmath61 .",
    "we first consider the reference case where @xmath61 is associated with a lorentzian line .",
    "it then reads @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the half - width of the line @xcite and we immediately get @xmath77 with in particular @xmath78 , @xmath79 and thus @xmath80 .",
    "the last relation shows that achieving substantial fractional delays @xmath81 requires that @xmath82 .",
    "a quite remarkable property of the lorentzian case is that the impulse response has an exact analytical expression .",
    "this result has been obtained by crisp in a general study on the propagation of small - area pulses in absorbing and amplifying media @xcite but it can easily be retrieved from @xmath12 by using standard procedures of laplace transforms @xcite .",
    "one get @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively designate the dirac function , the @xmath87 order modified bessel function and the unit step function .",
    "the @xmath87 term @xmath88 in @xmath11 results from the constant value @xmath89 of @xmath12 far from resonance .",
    "this part of the response is instantaneous in our local time picture and only the @xmath90 term @xmath91 , directly associated with the transmission peak , contribute to the delay .",
    "the areas of @xmath88 and @xmath91 are respectively @xmath89 and @xmath92 , that is in a very small ratio ( @xmath93 ) for the large values of @xmath63 required to achieve substantial delays ( see above ) .",
    "the fractional delay @xmath94 ) is 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 , 49 and 64 ( resp . 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 and 4 ) . the horizontal ( resp .",

    "we see that the curves , first strongly asymmetric , become more and more symmetric as @xmath63 increases and that the location of their maximum then approaches the group delay .",
    "they have a discontinuity @xmath96 at @xmath97 , the relative amplitude of which becomes negligible when @xmath82 . from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath85 @xcite , we then get @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",

    "when @xmath102 , @xmath103 this gaussian form is that of the normal distribution derived by means of the central limit theorem in probability theory .",
    "this theorem can also be used for an approximate evaluation of the convolution of @xmath104 deterministic functions @xcite .",
    "it applies to our case by splitting the medium in @xmath104 cascaded sections , @xmath11 being then the convolution of the impulse responses of each section . according to this analysis , one may expect that the normal form @xmath105 is universal . from the frequency viewpoint",
    ", it originates in the fact that , when @xmath82 , the transmission peak is roughly @xmath106 times narrower than the line . in the region where the relative gain @xmath107 is not negligible , the curves @xmath17 vs @xmath20 ( phase - shift ) and @xmath16 vs @xmath20 ( line - profile ) are well approximated respectively by a straight line and a parabola ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",

    "this confirms the universality of the normal form of @xmath11 when @xmath102 .",

    "the effect of the medium on the light - pulse is simply to delay its maximum exactly by the group delay , to broaden it by the factor @xmath150 [ 1 , 9 ] and to modify its amplitude accordingly in order to respect the area theorem @xcite .",
    "since this point is often overlooked , we stress that the broadening mechanism radically differs from that occurring in standard optical fibres @xcite .",
    "it originates in the @xmath90 order gain - dispersion instead of in the group - velocity dispersion and the pulse envelope keeps real ( no phase modulation or frequency chirping ) .",

    "[ fig9],width=302 ]    @xmath240 is then easily derived from @xmath232 .",
    "it reads @xmath253\\label{eq13}\\ ] ] with @xmath254 each discontinuity in @xmath7 actually originates a large transient . its initial amplitude is equal to that of the incident pulse and its successive maximums of intensity occur at the instants @xmath255 later , @xmath256 being the @xmath257 zero of @xmath235 @xcite . note that the amplitude of the transients exceeds that of the smooth part of @xmath8 . in a real experiment",
    "however the finite values of the rise and fall times of the incident pulse and of the detection bandwidth will generally limit the importance of the transients . by a deliberate reduction of the detection bandwidth , it is even possible to bring their intensity to a very low level without significantly affecting the delayed gaussian - like part ( see inset of fig.[fig9 ] ) .",
    "the results obtained on the model eit - arrangement hold for an extended class of systems having a transparency - window in a wide absorption profile .",
    "they only lie on three assumptions : ( i ) @xmath28 is lorentzian in the far wings of the absorption profile ( ii ) the opaque regions are much wider that the transparency - window ( iii ) the transfer - function does not significantly deviate from the normal form in the transparency - window . the first condition ( i )",
    "is generally met even when @xmath28 is not lorentzian in its central part .",
    "anyway , it is not essential . if it is not met , the detailed shape of the transients is modified but not their main features ( instantaneous transmission , duration proportional to the inverse of the spectral width of the opaque regions ) . the conditions ( ii ) and",
    "( iii ) , which are closely related , are met in the eit experiments when the medium transmission is good at the frequency of the optical carrier ( see before ) but this is not always sufficient . as a counter - example we consider the experiment achieved by tanaka _ et al_. in an atomic vapour with a natural transparency - window between two strong absorption lines @xcite .",
    "the complex gain - factor reads @xmath258\\label{eq15}\\ ] ] where @xmath259 is the doublet splitting . despite an apparent similarity",
    ", the associated transfer - function dramatically differs from that obtained in eit when @xmath201 .",
    "indeed the two involved lines are here purely lorentzian ( not hybrid ) and a good transparency at @xmath22 is achieved only if @xmath260 .",
    "we then get @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "choosing the physical parameters such that @xmath123 , @xmath1 and @xmath47 equal their values in the eit experiment , we actually obtain a quite different gain profile with opaque regions whose width is smaller than that of the transparency - window ( fig.[fig10 ] ) .     for the two absorption - lines arrangement ( full line )",
    "compared to the corresponding normal gain - profile @xmath266 ( dotted line ) .",
    "@xmath123 , @xmath1 , @xmath41 and frequency unit as in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "inset : envelope of the transmitted pulse for a gaussian - shaped incident pulse ( full line ) compared to that obtained with the eit - arrangement ( dotted line ) . @xmath267 [ fig10],width=302 ]    this entails that the approximation @xmath268 only works in the immediate vicinity of @xmath22 .",
    "it is the same for the law @xmath269 , the skewness being very large ( @xmath270 ) . in such conditions ,",
    "even a gaussian - shaped pulse is strongly distorted ( see inset of fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "in fact the two absorption - lines arrangement allows one to attain large fractional delays @xmath271 with moderate distortion and broadening but this requires to involve much larger absorption - parameters and to accept a lower transmission .",
    "for example , tanaka _ et al .",
    "_ succeeded in obtaining @xmath272 with gaussian - like pulses ( see fig.4c in @xcite ) but the peak - intensity of the transmitted pulse was 75 times smaller than that of the incident pulse .",
    "their results are well reproduced with our two - lines model by taking @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "we then get @xmath275 and we actually are in a case of low distortion as previously discussed ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , pulses with discontinuities are excluded . since @xmath276",
    ", the resulting transients ( not delayed ) would indeed be much larger than the delayed part of the transmitted pulse and would obscure it .",
    "moreover , due to the narrowness of the opaque regions , the time scales of the transients and of the delayed part do not considerably differ and it is thus impossible to filter out the former without denaturing the latter .",
    "privileging the time - domain analysis , we have studied the linear propagation of light pulses , the frequency of which coincides with that of a pronounced maximum in the transmission of the medium .",
    "an important point is that substantial pulse - delays are only attained when the corresponding transmission exceeds the minimum one by a very large factor @xmath277 ( contrast ) .",
    "the impulse response of the medium then tends to a normal ( gaussian ) form , irrespective of the line profile associated with the transmission peak .",
    "the propagation of arbitrarily shaped light - pulses with significant delays and low distortion is possible when the _ rms _ duration @xmath41 of the medium impulse - response is small compared to that of the incident pulse ( @xmath146 ) , which should itself be small compared to the group delay @xmath1 .",
    "the fulfilment of this double condition requires systems where @xmath277 is extremely large , typically several tens of thousands of @xmath278 in a logarithmic scale .",
    "systems with such contrast have actually been used @xcite but , in most slow - light experiments , @xmath277 ranges from 30 to 600 db .",
    "significant fractional time - delays @xmath271 keep attainable with such values of @xmath277 by using incident pulses , the duration of which is comparable to or smaller than @xmath41 . as the medium impulse - response , the transmitted pulse then tends to acquire a normal ( gaussian ) shape whatever its initial shape is .",
    "this reshaping is particularly striking when the incident pulse is square - shaped but is reduced to a simple broadening when the latter is itself gaussian - shaped . despite its asymptotic character , the normal form generally provides a good approximation of the shape of the transmitted pulse .",
    "more precise shapes are obtained by a perturbation method , allowing us in particular to specify how much the delay of the pulse - maximum deviates from the group delay .",
    "all these results have been first established by assuming that the transmission peak is put on an uniform background .",
    "we have shown that they also apply when the transmission peak is associated with a transparency window in an absorption - profile of finite width .",
    "this however requires that the nearly opaque regions flanking the transparency window be considerably wider than the latter .",
    "other things being equal , there are then no differences between the cases of uniform and non uniform transmission - backgrounds , at least when the envelope of the incident pulse is smooth",
    ". conversely localised defects in this envelope will be responsible for the generation of very short transients which complement the normal ( gaussian ) part of the signal .",
    "the front of the transients is instantaneously propagated in our local time picture ( that is at the velocity @xmath3 in a dilute sample ) . in extreme cases ,",
    "their amplitude may be comparable to that of the delayed signal but , due to their location and their duration , they can easily be eliminated without altering the latter .",
    "the slow and fast light experiments have a common feature . in both cases ,",
    "the observation of significant effects requires media with a very large contrast between the maximum and the minimum of transmission .",
    "this results from the causality principle and implies severe limits to the effects attainable in fast - light experiments , whatever the involved system is @xcite . from this viewpoint",
    "the slow - light case is obviously less pathologic and the constraints , although real , are much softer .",
