    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are generally thought to be the dominant sources of galactic cosmic rays . for this to be true , snrs",
    "need to transfer about 10% of their initial kinetic energy into cosmic rays .",
    "an open question is whether snr shocks can reach these acceleration efficiencies averaged over their life time ; recent tev and gev @xmath4-ray observations give promising but ambiguous results @xcite .",
    "although the process of efficiently accelerating particles is well understood @xcite , observational verifications for efficient acceleration are scarce ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations are essential for characterizing the efficiency of the acceleration . as the particles move ahead ( i.e. upstream ) of the shock , they form a so - called shock precursor , which compresses and pre - heats the upstream medium .",
    "this effectively lowers the mach number of the main shock , therewith lowering the temperature behind the shock front @xcite .",
    "this effect would ideally be characterized by the post - shock proton temperature ( @xmath5 ) , as @xmath5 is close to the plasma temperature , whereas the post - shock electron temperature @xmath6 might be lower ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the latter implies that the electrons might constitute only a minor part of the thermal pressure behind the shock front .    for some snrs",
    ", @xmath5 can be determined from hydrogen line emission at the shock fronts ; these are so - called balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "the hydrogen lines of a balmer - dominated shock consist of two superimposed components ; the narrow component is emitted by neutral hydrogen after entering the shock front and the broad component by hot protons after undergoing charge exchange with incoming neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "the width of the broad component reflects the proton temperature behind the shock front @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fit ]    approximate flux calibration based on an observation of a photometric standard star ( ltt 2415 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) taken on november 11 , 2010",
    "to determine the shock velocity , we use the x - ray line width of @xmath7 kms@xmath2 , as observed by the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) onboard xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "this line width is caused by both the thermal and bulk broadening of the plasma .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite to disentangle the bulk broadening from the thermal broadening to obtain the forward shock velocity , as described below .    as shown in @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are related as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 : the ratio ot the reverse shock velocity to the forward shock velocity and @xmath12 : the gradient in the plasma bulk velocity from reverse to forward shock .",
    "we obtain @xmath13 ( whole remnant ) and @xmath14 ( ne ) , from analytical models @xcite with @xmath15 , @xmath16 erg and an age of 400 years @xcite . additionally , we constrain the models with a forward shock radius of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the entire remnant and the ne respectively and a reverse shock radius of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the entire remnant and the ne respectively , based on a deprojection of chandra images ( 48.9 ks , obs id:776 ) , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath21 with numerical simulations @xcite , using the above parameters .",
    "we use equation ( [ vrgs ] ) to estimate @xmath22 kms@xmath2  ( whole remnant ) and @xmath23 kms@xmath2  ( ne ) . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we use conservative @xmath9 estimates of 5000 kms@xmath2  for the sw and 6000 kms@xmath2  for the ne .    to check these shock velocities , we estimated the expansion with chandra .",
    "chandra observed snr 0509 - 67.5 for 3 times , with the first observation in may 2000 ( earlier used in this section to determine forward and reverse shock radii ) and the latter two in may 2007 ( 29.5 and 32.7 ks , obs ids 7635 and 8554 ) . following the method of @xcite",
    ", we find a shock velocity of 6700 @xmath24 kms@xmath2   averaged over the azimuth of the remnant .",
    "note that a full proper motion study of snr 0509 - 67.5 , using both chandra and hubble data , is underway @xcite .",
    "the dense material in the sw ( fig .",
    "[ hst ] ) suggests that the forward shock might have recently slowed down .",
    "however , we do not find any support for this scenario from the chandra expansion study , nor from our xmm - newton / rgs study .",
    "moreover , as the rgs study is skewed towards the bright sw region , it is unlikely that the sw velocity is substantially lower than 6000 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the centroid of the broad component in the sw of @xmath25 kms@xmath2  indicates the bulk line - of -sight velocity of the shocked protons .",
    "additionally , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is moving with a 278 kms@xmath2  away from us @xcite .",
    "this means that we are observing a part of the shell which is moving toward us with 620 kms@xmath2  with respect to the lmc .",
    "figure [ hst ] shows a bright , inner shell close to the outer shock .",
    "taking into account the seeing of 0.8 - 1.0 , our spectrum is probably contaminated by emission from this shell .",
    "this part of the shell is likely to dominate the measurement by @xcite , as they also measured a positive offset for the centroid of the broad component .",
    "the flux in the broad component with respect to the flux in the narrow component ( @xmath26 ) declines as a function of shock velocity @xcite .",
    "our low values for @xmath26 are therefore consistent with a high shock velocity with likely the highest shock velocity in the ne , which has the lowest @xmath26 . however , as the standard models for interpreting balmer dominated shocks do not include the effects of cosmic - ray acceleration , it is not appropriate to use the @xmath26 values to determine the shock velocities of snr 0509 - 67.5 .     +     +      to determine the cosmic - ray pressure from our measurements , we need to determine @xmath5 from the fwhm . for low temperatures and shock velocities , @xmath27 @xcite , with @xmath28 in @xmath29 . however , as cross sections for charge exchange decline for high velocities ( e.g. fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath30 for higher temperatures and shock velocities .",
    "recent studies focused on determining the fwhm as function of @xmath9 for non - accelerating shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* resulting in fig .",
    "[ kosenkadel ] ) . here , we are interested in fwhm as function of @xmath5 for a given @xmath9 instead .",
    "we approximate this concave function linearly between 0,0 and the fwhm and @xmath5 expected for a non - accelerating shock in thermal equilibrium ( fig .",
    "[ kosenkadel ] and [ protont ] ) . in this way , we overestimate @xmath5 and the corresponding thermal pressure , leading to a conservative measure of the cosmic - ray pressure behind the shock front .",
    "we note that the y - axis of fig .",
    "5 of van @xcite is labeled incorrectly ( m. van adelsberg , 2010 , private communication ) . instead of showing the ` broad h@xmath0 fwhm '",
    ", this figure plots the ` broad neutral velocity distribution fwhm ' , which is independent of the emission line considered . to model a specific emission line such as h@xmath0",
    ", one has to convolve the broad neutral velocity distribution with the relevant atomic cross sections .",
    "the fwhm-@xmath9 relations we use in this study , obtained in electronic form from m. van adelsberg and k. heng , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ kosenkadel ] and are based upon the same relations used to generate figure 13 and table 1 of @xcite .    following @xcite and @xcite , we interpret @xmath5 and @xmath31 in terms of cosmic - ray pressure behind the shock front and cosmic - ray energy flux leaving the system ( respectively @xmath32 in which @xmath33 is the total pressure behind the shock front ( x - axis in figure [ energy ] ) and @xmath34 in which @xmath35 is the energy flux entering the shock ; @xmath36 ( y - axis of figure [ energy ] ) ) . to conservatively estimate the post - shock cosmic - ray pressure , we assume the electrons and ions to be in thermal equilibrium . we add @xmath37 and @xmath38 to the equations of conservation of mass , momentum and energy over the shock front , which leads to : @xmath39 formally , @xmath40 is the number averaged mean particle weight , ( @xmath41 0.54 for a fully equilibrated and fully ionized plasma with lmc abundances ) , when considering @xmath42 , we can treat @xmath40 as well as a measure for the temperature equilibration behind the shock front , where @xmath43 indicates no temperature equilibration , and @xmath44 indicates a fully equilibrated plasma .",
    "in addition , @xmath45 is the total shock compression ratio . for a non - accelerating , adiabatic shock , @xmath46 and hence @xmath47 .",
    "we define @xmath48 , to characterize the influence of cosmic - ray acceleration on @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ energy ] shows @xmath49 in the ( @xmath37 , @xmath38)-frame .",
    "the ` max'-line indicates the ratio of the cosmic - ray pressure and escaping cosmic - ray energy for the most efficiently accelerating shock according to theory @xcite .",
    "hence , the hashed region is excluded .      for @xmath50 5000 kms@xmath2",
    ", we expect to measure at least a fwhm for the broad component of 3600 kms@xmath2 , corresponding to a @xmath5 of 28.7 kev ( fig [ kosenkadel ] ) .",
    "this differs significantly from the measured @xmath51  kms@xmath2 .",
    "we derive a @xmath5 of @xmath52 kev , leading to a @xmath53 , which gives a cosmic - ray pressure behind the shock front of at least 20% ( fig . [ energy ] ) .      for the ne , the measured fwhm indicates a @xmath54 6000 kms@xmath2 , for 0.2@xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ kosenkadel ] ) .",
    "this leads to two possibilities : + 1 ) the shock does not efficiently accelerate cosmic rays and has a @xmath56 , breaking with the earlier reported trend of @xmath57 for @xmath58 kms@xmath2  @xcite , as this would give @xmath59 for @xmath60 kms@xmath2 .",
    "+ 2 ) the shock is far out of thermal equilibrium , as we might expect for a fast shock , and is accelerating particles . if we assume @xmath61 , we expect a fwhm of @xmath625100 kms@xmath2 , whereas we measure @xmath3 kms@xmath2 . using the approach from section [ interpretation ] and fig .",
    "[ energy ] , we obtain @xmath63 and hence a cosmic - ray pressure behind the shock front of @xmath64 of the total pressure .",
    "note that this is a very conservative lower limit : for both @xmath65 and @xmath9 we used conservative approximations . also , at this high shock velocity , the squared line width of the broad component does not increase linearly with @xmath5 , but flattens off .",
    "this makes the difference in line width lower for a given @xmath66 , which makes that the line width is a less sensitive temperature indicator at high shock velocities .",
    "future progress can be made with better shock velocity estimates of the ne region itself , a higher signal - over - noise spectrum of the ne region and with models for non - radiative balmer dominated shocks that include the effects of cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "a remaining question is whether the magnetic field pressure makes a contribution to the post - shock pressure . as snr 0509 - 67.5",
    "is at a distance of 50 kpc , we can not resolve filaments of x - ray synchrotron emission , which are often used for determining post - shock magnetic field strengths @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a typical value for the magnetic field pressure is around 3.5% of the total post - shock pressure . moreover , according to bell s theory @xcite the magnetic field energy density scales as @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the cosmic ray energy density .",
    "this means that the magnetic field energy density is expected to be about 1% of the cosmic - ray energy density .",
    "we investigated the cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency of the 0509 - 67.5 snr in the lmc , by comparing @xmath5 , determined from the h@xmath0-line widths of the sw and ne shocks with shock velocities of respectively 5000 kms@xmath2  and 6000 kms@xmath2  for the sw and ne , based on x - ray observations .",
    "our study gives the following results :    * we measured widths of the broad components of the h@xmath0 lines in snr 0509 - 67.5 to be @xmath51 kms@xmath2  for the sw and @xmath3 kms@xmath2  for the ne . * for the sw , we can only explain the fwhm if we allow for a contribution of @xmath69 of the post - shock pressure by cosmic rays .",
    "* for the ne shock , we have two options : either the shock has a @xmath70 , breaking with the earlier reported trend of @xmath57 for @xmath71 kms@xmath2  @xcite , or if we assume @xmath72 , the cosmic - ray pressure behind the shock front is at least 7% of the total pressure .",
    "this research , together with our previous study @xcite , shows that more than 10% of the pressure in young snrs can be contributed by cosmic rays .",
    "this is more than the requirement that 10% of the available energy needs to be in cosmic rays . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency may decline for older snrs , as indicated by a recent study of the cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "so a higher efficiency at a young age may be needed to have an average efficiency of 10% over the whole lifetime of a snr .",
