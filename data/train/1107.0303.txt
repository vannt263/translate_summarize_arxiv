    "over the last couple of decades , considerable effort has been put into the study of @xmath7-bps effective couplings in four - dimensional extended supersymmetric theories .",
    "such couplings depend only on half of the superspace , generalizing the well - known chiral f - terms of @xmath8 supersymmetry .",
    "they usually enjoy particular non - renormalization theorems which is the reason why they are easier to study from a field theoretic point of view .",
    "moreover , these couplings play a predominant role in many very interesting applications , ranging from string phenomenology to entropy corrections of supersymmetric black holes .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to classify different kinds of 1/2-bps couplings and study their properties in as much generality as possible .    in the string theory effective action , @xmath7-bps couplings are expected to be captured by topological amplitudes , i.e.  amplitudes which only depend on the zero - mode structure of the internal manifold  @xcite .",
    "the best studied example in this respect is the celebrated series @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the chiral @xmath0 weyl superfield of the supergravity multiplet .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are computed as @xmath12 loop amplitudes in type  ii string theory compactified on a calabi - yau threefold  @xcite and are functions of the vector multiplet moduli in the coulomb phase of the theory . in particular , their independence of @xmath0 hypermultiplet moduli ( and therefore also of the type  ii dilaton ) implies a non - renormalization theorem that @xmath11 is @xmath12-loop exact .",
    "moreover , classically their bps nature dictates that the @xmath11 are holomorphic functions .",
    "this property is broken at the quantum level , however , in a controlled manner captured by a first order differential equation , termed the _ holomorphic anomaly equation _",
    "the latter takes the form of a recursion relation in @xmath12 which in fact allows in some cases to find explicit expressions for @xmath11 up to considerably high genus  @xcite .",
    "the heterotic versions of the @xmath11 s have been considered in @xcite .",
    "they are semi - topological expressions ( i.e.  topological only in the supersymmetric sector ) , related to f - terms of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is now the @xmath8 gauge superfield . again",
    "the bps - nature of these couplings classically implies a ( first order ) holomorphicity condition for the @xmath11 which is broken at the quantum level .",
    "the difference to the type  ii side is , however , that the corresponding ( integrable ) holomorphic anomaly equation , which captures this breaking , does no longer close on the class of functions @xmath11 , but introduces new ( semi)-topological objects .",
    "the latter have been understood to be physically related to bps couplings of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 s are chiral projections of non - holomorphic functions of chiral superfields .",
    "more recently , after studying a particular world - sheet involution of a certain class of @xmath17 topological amplitudes   @xcite ( see also @xcite as well as the review @xcite ) , we have presented a completely new class of @xmath0 topological amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the latter compute a corresponding class of 1/2-bps terms in the low energy effective action of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a particular superdescendant of the vector superfield in @xmath0 harmonic superspace  @xcite .",
    "the novel property is that their coupling coefficients depend on both holomorphic vector multiplet as well as particular ( grassmann ) analytic hypermultiplet moduli , despite the common wisdom of mutual decoupling .",
    "classically , this particular analytic dependence  which is again a direct consequence of the bps nature of the couplings  can be captured by differential equations , namely a _ holomorphicity _",
    "relation for the vector moduli and a _ harmonicity relation _ together with another second order equation for the hypermultiplet moduli . as",
    "before , at the quantum level these differential equations get modified by anomalous string world - sheet boundary contributions .    in this work , we show that these new topological objects are in fact a particular subclass of an even further generalized set of @xmath0 topological amplitudes .",
    "we make a systematic analysis of the latter on the heterotic string side ( compactified on @xmath1 ) by first computing them as genus-@xmath12 amplitudes involving an appropriate number of fermions ( gauginos and hyperinos ) and establish explicitly their connection with the ( semi)-topological theory obtained by twisting only the supersymmetric ( left - moving ) sector .",
    "we then show that this generic amplitude corresponds to a new series of higher order couplings in the effective action , involving both vector multiplets and neutral hypermultiplets .",
    "they depend on the moduli ( both vectors and hypermultiplets ) in a quite generic manner , which particularly means that there is no immediate direct generalization of the holomorphicity or harmonicity equation .",
    "however , the bps nature of these couplings manifests itself in another very useful property : the particular ( grassmann)-analytic projection which is necessary for consistency of these couplings leads us to establish relations between different component couplings . on the string theory side ,",
    "these relations turn out to be highly non - trivial ( first order ) differential equations which again get modified by anomalous world - sheet boundary contributions .",
    "we explicitly compute these anomaly terms for these more general amplitudes ( up to possible curvature dependent contact terms ) as well as for the subclass considered in  @xcite and show that the equations close in the sense that no new topological objects appear .",
    "this indicates that the amplitude we consider captures the most generic expression in this particular class of bps - couplings .",
    "we study the integrability of these equations and show that for the latter , the equations we have obtained are integrable including also the curvature terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : effectaction ] , we compute a particular multi - fermion genus-@xmath12 physical amplitude and we show that it acquires a ( semi)-topological expression as a correlation function in the twisted @xmath1 heterotic @xmath20-model .",
    "this amplitude has four types of indices , labeling the two different helicities ( i.e. weyl spinor components ) of the antichiral gauginos and hyperinos involved .",
    "contracting these indices ( which have particular symmetry properties ) with four fermionic variables , one can introduce a generating functional , in terms of which the results take a compact form and are greatly simplified .",
    "in section  [ sect : harmonicdescription ] , we describe the interpretation of the above amplitudes as a particular class of 1/2-bps terms in the string effective action . in sections  [ sect :",
    "anomalyequation ] and  [ sect : anomalyequationm20 ] , we derive differential equations for respectively the generalized amplitudes and the reduced ones that were obtained in  @xcite . as we show in section  [ sect : fieldtheoryequ ] , these relations follow from the particular ( grassmann)-analytic projection which we used in formulating the couplings . these equations are a direct consequence of the 1/2-bps structure of these couplings and relate the anti - holomorphic dependence on the vector moduli with the dependence on the hypermultiplets of ` wrong ' harmonicity in different component couplings . in string theory we find that ( as usual ) these equations get modified by an anomaly due to world - sheet boundary contributions . as a result ,",
    "one obtains recursion relations for the non - holomorphic / harmonic moduli dependence of the above amplitudes . in sections [ sect :",
    "anomalyequation ] and  [ sect : anomalyequationm20 ] we also study the integrability conditions of the anomaly equations . our conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] . although the notation and conventions of this paper are those of ref .",
    "@xcite , to make it self - contained , we include several appendices .",
    "appendix  [ append : sca ] gives a brief review of @xmath0 and @xmath17 superconformal algebras , appendix  [ app : harmsuperspace ] summarizes the main properties of @xmath0 harmonic superspace , appendix  [ app : hetk3comp ] presents some essential features of the heterotic @xmath1 compactification , appendix  [ app : gaugefreedomepotential ] describes the gauge freedom associated to one of the two general series of couplings , and appendix  [ stringdiffeqs ] contains the direct string derivation of the differential equations , as well as the computation of a particular world - sheet boundary contribution which we deemed too lengthy to be presented in the main body of the paper .",
    "in the paper @xcite by studying higher derivative couplings of holomorphic @xmath0 vector multiplets with hypermultiplets of a particular analyticity in heterotic string theory compactified on @xmath1 , a new class of @xmath0 topological amplitudes was discovered .",
    "they can be expressed as the following ( semi-)topological correlators @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the integral over the moduli space of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath12 .",
    "deformations of the latter are parametrized by a total of @xmath24 beltrami differentials @xmath25 .",
    "the operators sewed with these beltrami differentials in ( [ originalamplitude ] ) are part of a twisted @xmath0 superconformal algebra , which we have briefly reviewed in appendix  [ append : sca ] .",
    "the free fermion @xmath26 , which is inserted at an arbitrary position @xmath27 on the riemann surface , serves the purpose of soaking up the holomorphic zero mode of the @xmath28 torus .",
    "finally , @xmath29 are the zero modes of the corresponding right - moving currents @xmath30 associated with the gauge group in the heterotic theory .    the correlators ( [ originalamplitude ] ) , however , are not yet the most generic objects one might envisage .",
    "indeed , already in @xcite a generalization was worked out by allowing also a dependence on non - holomorphic vector multiplets .",
    "indeed , the following semi - topological expression was found in a @xmath12-loop heterotic string amplitude for @xmath31 ( for details of the notation see @xcite ) @xmath32\\psi_3(p)(\\text{det}q)^2\\rangle\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denotes the integral over the moduli space of a genus @xmath12 riemann surface with @xmath34 punctures @xmath35 .",
    "note that deformations of the latter are parametrized by @xmath36 beltrami differentials @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , it was also noted that the hypermultiplets of the wrong analyticity ( _ i.e. _ different than the one induced by the f - term like measure in harmonic superspace ) are associated with operators of the form @xmath37 .",
    "the latter are labeled by an @xmath38 index @xmath39 and transform as doublets under the @xmath40 current algebra .",
    "besides they are @xmath17 primary operators in the sense that each of them is annihilated by half of the supercharges @xmath41 these fields have left and right conformal dimension @xmath42 and are @xmath40 highest weight states @xmath43 with @xmath44 charges @xmath45 respectively .",
    "this suggests that the most generic amplitude , with a dependence on holomorphic and anti - holomorphic vector multiplets and hypermultiplets of all analyticities , should structurally be of the form here into an additional puncture @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , for reasons which will become clearer later on , we have denoted this expression with a tilde . ] @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 arbitrary integers .",
    "as we will see in the remainder of this work , this is essentially correct and we will prove it by showing that there is indeed a string amplitude , which ( after some manipulations ) gives rise to this expression . more specifically , we will calculate in the next subsection a heterotic @xmath12-loop amplitude with insertions of @xmath50 chiral gauginos , @xmath51 anti - chiral gauginos , two chiral and @xmath52 anti - chiral hyperfermions and further discuss its relation to ( [ gentopobject ] ) .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , we will compute the heterotic amplitude at a generic point in the moduli space of the @xmath1 compactification . for a brief review of the notation as well as for explicit expressions of the vertex operators see appendix  [ app : hetk3comp ] . here , for convenience , we just give table  [ tab : vertex ] containing the fermion charges with respect to space - time and torus fermions ( bosonized in terms of scalars @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively ) and the @xmath56-charge of the vertex operators for the physical fields as well as the picture changing operators ( pco ) . the last column * rm * denotes the right moving ( bosonic ) piece of the vertex operator .",
    "we have not displayed the superghost part in the table , however , all matter fields are understood to be inserted in the @xmath57 ghost picture , i.e. their vertices come with @xmath58 , while the pco come with a factor of @xmath59 .",
    ".fermion and @xmath56-charges for all vertex operators and picture changing operators ( pco ) .",
    "all physical vertex operators are inserted in the @xmath60 picture , while all pco contribute a factor of @xmath59 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that all operators have now dimension @xmath61 and are integrated over the world - sheet as it is appropriate .",
    "let us also remind again that the operator @xmath62 does not have well defined harmonic @xmath44 charge .",
    "however , just as before , after performing all contractions of the @xmath26 free fermions , only those contributions will survive in ( [ topampsimpleinteg ] ) which have a well defined charge .      for later use we will consider now the symmetry properties of the topological expression ( [ genericloophet ] ) .",
    "first of all , we notice that the latter is anti - symmetric in each set of indices @xmath39 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 separately .",
    "this is manifest in the expression ( [ genericloophet ] ) for the indices @xmath39 and @xmath64 and follows from the fermionic properties of the operators @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "as we can see from the fully integrated expression ( [ topampsimpleinteg ] ) , in fact the same is also true for the indices @xmath63 and @xmath65 as it is expected from the physical component amplitude which we started from in section  [ sect : genericamplitudestring ] .",
    "although not manifestly visible from the expression ( [ topampsimple ] ) , the amplitudes @xmath68 also have symmetries upon exchanging , say , @xmath64 with @xmath65 indices . to see this , we consider the expression ( [ topampsimpleinteg ] ) with integrated insertions and rewrite for example @xmath69 deforming the contour integral the only non - vanishing residues are @xmath70 such that we immediately get @xmath71}\\prod_{b=1}^{m_2 + 1}\\int\\phi^{b_b}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{0.5cm}\\cdot \\prod_{c=1}^{n - m_1}\\int\\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{i}_c } \\int \\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_1}\\prod_{d=2}^{n - m_2 }   \\int g^+_{k3,+}\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_d}\\bigg\\rangle+\\frac{1}{(3g-3)!}\\int_{\\mathcal{m}_{g}}\\bigg\\langle ( \\mu\\cdot g^-)^{3g-3}\\prod_{a=1}^{m_1 + 1}\\int \\bar{\\xi}^{a_a}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{0.5cm}\\cdot\\prod_{b=1}^{m_2 + 1}\\int\\phi^{b_b}\\prod_{c=1}^{n - m_1 - 1}\\int\\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{i}_c}\\int \\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_1}\\int g^+_{k3,+}\\bar{j}_{\\bar{i}_{n - m_1 } } \\prod_{d=2}^{n - m_2}\\int g^+_{k3,+}\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_d}\\bigg\\rangle\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can rewrite the right hand side of this equation to obtain @xmath72 notice that if we formally combine the indices @xmath73 into a new ( multi ) index @xmath74 and similarly @xmath75 into @xmath76 , the relation is simply the statement @xmath77\\ldots n_n}=0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the direct generalization of identity ( 3.7 ) in @xcite .      in view of the symmetry properties derived in the previous section",
    ", we can introduce a shorthand notation which will allow us to greatly simplify many of the following computations .",
    "indeed , observing the particular fermionic nature of all insertions in table  [ tab : chargediminteg ] it seems appropriate to introduce four types of grassmann valued quantities @xmath78 and to define the following generating functional  just like in @xcite @xmath79 in this form , every summand in @xmath80 can be thought of as a differential form with respect to @xmath78 of degree @xmath81 . in order to also capture the particular case @xmath82 , which will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sect : partcasem20 ] ,",
    "let us also introduce a reduced version of @xmath80 . by restricting to the term @xmath82 in the summation of ( [ generatingfunct ] )",
    "we can define @xmath83 notice that every summand of this expression can be interpreted as a differential form with respect to @xmath78 of degree @xmath84 .    in order to demonstrate the usefulness of this notation",
    "let us just note that the symmetry property ( [ symmrel ] ) can be written more compactly as @xmath85\\mathbb{h}^g=0\\,,&&\\text{and }   & & \\left[{\\vartheta}^{\\bar{i}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\eta^{\\bar{i}}}+\\chi_a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\xi_a}\\right]\\mathbb{h}^g_{\\text{red}}=0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the fact that ( [ symmrel ] ) is valid for every single summand in the sum over @xmath86 in ( [ generatingfunct ] ) .",
    "therefore it follows that the equation holds for @xmath80 as well as for the reduced generating functional ( [ generatingfunctred ] ) .",
    "an observation which will turn out important for the remainder of this work is the fact that @xmath80 is in a certain sense an exact form with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "a first hint towards this is to realize that @xmath80 is closed , i.e. @xmath90 to see this , we consider the anti - symmetrized derivative @xmath91,b_1\\ldots b_{m_2 + 1}}_{\\bar{i}_1\\ldots\\bar{i}_{n - m_1},\\bar{j}_1\\ldots\\bar{j}_{n - m_2}}=\\frac{1}{(g+m_1+m_2-n)!(2g+2n - m_1-m_2 - 2)!}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{0.5cm}\\cdot\\,\\int_{\\mathcal{m}_{(g , n+1)}}\\hspace{-0.7cm}\\langle{(\\mu\\cdot g^-_{t^2})}^{g+m_1+m_2-n}{(\\mu\\cdot g^-_{k3,+})}^{2g+2n - m_1-m_2 - 2}\\int \\oint g^+_{k3,+}\\bar{\\xi}^{[a_1}\\prod_{a=2}^{m_1 + 2}\\int \\bar{\\xi}^{a_a]}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{0.5cm}\\cdot\\prod_{b=1}^{m_2 + 1}(\\psi_3\\xi^{b_b})\\prod_{c=1}^{n - m_1}\\int\\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{i}_c}\\prod_{d=1}^{n - m_2}(j^{++}_{k3}\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_d})\\rangle\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] deforming the contour integral @xmath92 , however , it produces no pole with any of the other operators and therefore vanishes .",

    "can be more compactly written in the following form @xmath106 notice that this relation is in a certain sense equivalent to stating that @xmath80 is an exact form as concerning the @xmath89 variables .",
    "one should realize that similar to @xmath80 in ( [ generatingfunct ] ) , also every summand of @xmath107 can be interpreted as a differential form in @xmath78 .",
    "the important difference , however , is that the corresponding degrees are @xmath108 , i.e. the degree in @xmath89 is shifted by one relative to ( [ generatingfunct ] ) .",
    "the discussion of the previous sub - section focused entirely on the properties of @xmath80 as a function of the @xmath89 variables . since in the amplitude computation of section  [",
    "sect : genericamplitudestring ] the indices @xmath39 and @xmath63 ( an therefore also the variables @xmath89 and @xmath110 ) enter on the same footing , one would expect similar properties of @xmath80 also with respect to the @xmath110 variables .",
    "this is essentially the case , although , as we will discover now , there is a slight subtlety .",
    "let us again begin by proving that @xmath80 is closed with respect to @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 to this end , we consider the anti - symmetrized derivative @xmath112}_{\\bar{i}_1\\ldots\\bar{i}_{n - m_1},\\bar{j}_1\\ldots\\bar{j}_{n - m_2}}= \\frac{1}{(3g+n-1)!}\\cdot\\,\\int_{\\mathcal{m}_{(g , n+2)}}\\hspace{-0.7cm}\\langle(\\mu\\cdot g^-)^{3g+n-1}\\prod_{a=1}^{m_1 + 1}\\int \\bar{\\xi}^{a_a}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{1cm}\\cdot\\xi^{[b_1}\\prod_{b=2}^{m_2 + 2}(\\psi_3\\xi^{b_b]})\\prod_{c=1}^{n - m_1}\\int\\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{i}_c}\\prod_{d=1}^{n - m_2}(j^{++}_{k3}\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_d})\\rangle\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have inserted the vertex operator in its un - integrated form at an additional puncture of the genus @xmath12 riemann surface and added a further beltrami differential .",
    "writing now @xmath113 and deforming the @xmath67 contour integral it produces no pole with any of the other insertions",
    ". therefore this expression vanishes , which proves equation ( [ xiexacth ] ) .      in order to understand in",
    "how far @xmath114 is also an exact form with respect to @xmath115 ( in the sense of the previous section ) , we will first discuss the particular case @xmath82 , which has some interesting properties on its own .",
    "the corresponding @xmath101 takes the form of @xmath116 in writing this expression we have used the fact that the only left - over @xmath26 ( originally situated at @xmath117 ) is not able to contract with any other operator but is forced to soak the torus zero mode .",
    "it can therefore be inserted at an arbitrary position on the world - sheet which we call @xmath27 .",
    "we can now proceed to transform the @xmath118 insertion into its integrated form by localizing one of the beltrami differentials @xmath119 the insertion of @xmath120 is , however , just a zero picture vertex operator , which we can pull out in the form of a moduli derivative @xmath121 with the new topological expression @xmath122 we can also find a similar interpretation for equations ( [ hyperder2 ] ) and ( [ hyperder3 ] ) involving the reduced generating functional . indeed ,",
    "equation ( [ hyperder2 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xmath123 with the newly introduced potential @xmath124 for completeness , let us also mention that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are of course still exact with respect to @xmath89 in the following sense @xmath127 with the corresponding potentials @xmath128 where we have introduced the topological object @xmath129 which satisfies the following identity @xmath130}_{\\bar{i}_1\\ldots\\bar{i}_{n - m_1},\\bar{j}_1\\ldots\\bar{j}_{n}}\\,.\\label{hyperder3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the degrees of every single summand in ( [ exactnessm20 ] ) are respectively @xmath131 we remark that ( [ m20redcase ] ) is precisely the topological expression conjectured in ( [ gentopobject ] ) .",
    "hence we have shown that there is also an actual string amplitude related to ( [ m20redcase ] ) .",
    "this raises the question what the corresponding term in the string effective action looks like and whether it is possible to extract from it information about the @xmath7-bps nature of @xmath132 along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we will return to this question in section  [ sect : harmonicdescription ] .",
    "it is important to point out that all manipulations of the previous section were only possible for @xmath82 since only then the string theory amplitude allows to put the @xmath26 insertion at some arbitrary position . in the case of @xmath133",
    ", there would be additional contractions which invalidate these steps .",
    "however , independent of its origin in string theory , even for @xmath133 we can consider the following object @xmath134 notice in particular that this quantity depends on the position @xmath27 ( which is a clear indication that it can not come from a string theory computation ) .",
    "however , as we show in appendix  [ app : gaugefreedomepotential ] , changing the position @xmath27 just amounts to adding an expression which is a derivative with respect to @xmath135 @xmath136 where @xmath137 is written in ( [ generatingfunctg ] ) . therefore , taking an anti - symmetrized derivative of @xmath138 we in fact obtain @xmath139}_{\\bar{i}_1\\ldots\\bar{i}_{n - m_1},\\bar{j}_1\\ldots\\bar{j}_{n}}(\\alpha)=\\frac{1}{(3g+n-2)!}\\int_{\\mathcal{m}_{(g , n+1 ) } } \\hspace{-0.7cm}\\langle(\\mu\\cdot g^-)^{3g+n-2}\\psi_3(\\alpha)\\prod_{a=1}^{m_1 + 1}\\int \\bar{\\xi}^{a_a}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{1cm}\\cdot\\prod_{b=1}^{n - m_1}\\int(\\bar{\\psi}_3\\bar{j}_{\\bar{i}_b})\\,\\xi^{[b_1}\\prod_{c=2}^{m_2 + 1}(\\psi_3\\xi^{b_c]})\\prod_{d=1}^{n - m_2}(j^{++}_{k3}\\bar{j}_{\\bar{j}_d})\\rangle\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that this expression is independent of @xmath27 : according to ( [ gaugefreedome ] ) changing the position of @xmath27 results in an extra contribution which lies in the kernel of @xmath135 .",

    "we note in passing that the subtle difference between @xmath89 and @xmath115 is due to the particular choice of setup ( and gauge fixing condition ) in section  [ sect : genericamplitudestring ] , where we have computed the topological amplitude .",
    "in the previous section we have considered particular amplitudes in heterotic string theory which are captured by correlation functions in a twisted two - dimensional theory . in this section",
    "we would like to understand which terms in the heterotic effective action these amplitudes correspond to and whether they have any interesting properties with respect to their moduli dependence .",

    "further , hitting ( [ 16 ] ) with @xmath380 we obtain zero as a consequence of the projection of the on - shell constraint ( [ 15 ] ) with @xmath381 . we conclude that @xmath149 satisfies the same g - analyticity constraints as the on - shell hypermultiplet ( [ ganalyticityhyper ] ) @xmath382 which imply that @xmath19 depends only on half of the @xmath383 s : @xmath384 in addition , the harmonic dependence of @xmath149 is restricted to be linear . as in ( [ hansf ] ) , this follows from the condition for h - analyticity @xmath385 in turn derived from the harmonic independence of @xmath373 ( @xmath386 ) and the commutator @xmath387=0 $ ] .",
