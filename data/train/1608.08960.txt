    "to understand the laws of transport starting from the underlying microscopic models is still a challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics . in particular",
    ", the investigation of energy or heat transport is a fundamental problem of general interest and many open questions .",
    "it is intriguing to recall that fourier s law , for example , a keystone of the heat conduction theory , was proposed two hundred years ago , but the precise necessary and sufficient conditions for its validity are still ignored @xcite .",
    "such law is empirically observed to hold in general insulating three - dimensional systems : the seminal parabolic heat diffusion equation , present in our basic text books , is derived from it .",
    "however , exhaustive numerical simulations and also theoretical works @xcite show that fourier s law fails for several low dimensional systems ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , in particular for models with total momentum conservation .",
    "moreover , experimental works have confirmed the occurrence of this predicted anomalous heat transport in nanomaterials related to some low dimensional models , such as carbon and boron - nitride nanotubes @xcite , graphene @xcite , nanowires @xcite , etc . in short ,",
    "the needfulness of detailed studies on the mechanism of transport in low dimensional structures is evident .    on the other side , in spite of these unanswered fundamental ( and difficult ) questions , the intense research in the area , together with the advance of nanotechnology ,",
    "has opened the exciting possibility to manipulate and control the energy current .",
    "inspired by the amazing development of modern electronics , thermal devices based on thermal diodes , e.g. , thermal transistors , gates , memories , etc , have been proposed @xcite and experimentally built @xcite . again",
    ", open questions , such as the lacking of efficient and feasible diodes , stimulate concentrated research .",
    "in such direction , we recall the intense analysis of graded materials , which appear as genuine candidates for rectifiers @xcite .",
    "graded materials are systems in which some structure changes gradually in space : besides being abundant in nature , they can be manufactured and have attracted interest in different areas , such as engineering , optics , material sciences , etc .    in the study of the microscopic mechanism of heat flow , it is also worth noting that most of the works @xcite involve classical dynamical models . consequently , this scarcity of quantum results , the present ambient of device miniaturization , together with the possibility of effects of quantum nature , makes the detailed study of energy transport in genuine quantum models a program of great importance . as an example of change in the transport properties due to the quantum / classical nature of the model , we recall that thermal rectification has been observed in the quantum graded harmonic chain of oscillators with inner baths @xcite , but it is absent in the classical version of the same model @xcite . a natural candidate for a quantum model describing these transport phenomena would be the quantum version of the chain of anharmonic oscillators , but",
    "even its classical version is already a problem of extreme difficulty @xcite .    in the present work , with focus on the energy transport properties in quantum , low dimensional , graded materials , we consider a more treatable genuine quantum model and address the investigation of the energy ( as well as spin ) current in graded quantum xxz open chains .",
    "we investigate the one - dimensional graded xxz model driven out of equilibrium by the presence of pumping applied at the ends , precisely , by the coupling of the boundary spins of the chain to magnetization reservoirs . in short , as a first step , we study the transport induced by a magnetization imbalance at the ends of the chain ( it will certainly be interesting , in a forthcoming work , to analyze the case of an energy imbalance , i.e. , genuine thermal baths instead of magnetization reservoirs , imposed at the boundaries ) .",
    "we study different types of graded structures in the xxz chain , and even different boundary conditions , in order to show that energy rectification ubiquitously holds in these graded spin chains .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the conditions behind the onset of energy rectification are intricate : the simple existence of asymmetry in the systems by no means guarantees the occurrence of rectification .",
    "we give a precise example .",
    "recall the classical harmonic chain of oscillators with inner stochastic reservoirs ( which mimic the absent anharmonic potentials in more realistic models ) .",
    "this is an old model @xcite , which is , however , recurrently studied @xcite .",
    "it has been rigorously proved that energy rectification is absent in any asymmetric version of this model ( for example , with a graded mass distribution or with graded interparticle interactions ) @xcite : it seems to exist a preferential direction for the energy flow , but it does not .",
    "we also need to stress that , besides the previously described motivation related to quantum effects on the mechanism and properties of energy transport in low dimensional systems , there is a huge and recurrent interest in the detailed study of the @xmath2 xxz chain by itself : it is an archetypal model to the investigation of open quantum systems with increasing attention in different areas , such as optics and cold - atoms , where it can be experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "many other fields of physics also involve problems related to open quantum systems , including nonequilibrium statistical physics , condensed matter , quantum information , high - energy physics , etc @xcite .",
    "we also need to emphasize that , in relation to specificities considered in the model ( e.g. , the graded structures and the boundary conditions ) , the progress of nanotechnology and related experimental techniques allows us to manipulate different materials , including those with few elements , say , quantum bits .",
    "even specific designs of the coupling between systems and reservoirs are possible , and different many - body states and quantum phases may be prepared by taken proper quantum reservoirs @xcite .",
    "in other words , even the study of specific versions of the xxz model is of considerable interest .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and describe the approach to be used in the computation of the currents in the steady state . in section iii ,",
    "we derive some expressions for the currents and make some analysis by considering symmetry arguments . in section iv , we analyze the results due to the computations in the the steady state .",
    "section v is devoted to final remarks , and in the appendix , we present some huge equations for the spin and energy currents under a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we consider here the one - dimensional quantum system given by the chain of @xmath3 particles with spin @xmath4 in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath5 , with nearest - neighbor interaction given by the @xmath6 model , namely , with hamiltonian ( for @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are the pauli matrices and @xmath11 is the external magnetic field acting on site ( particle ) @xmath12 .    to study the transport in the nonequilibrium steady state",
    ", we introduce a markovian dynamics , as usual .",
    "we couple the chain to different magnetization baths , one at each end , so that the time evolution of the system density matrix @xmath13 is given by a lindblad quantum master equation @xcite @xmath14 + \\mathcal{l}(\\rho ) ~.\\label{master}\\ ] ] the dissipator @xmath15 describes the coupling with the baths : in the lindblad form it is given by @xmath16 where , for @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 and a similar expression follows for @xmath19 , but with @xmath20 and @xmath21 replacing @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the expressions above , @xmath24 denotes the anticommutator ; @xmath25 are the spin creation and annihilation operators @xmath26  ; @xmath27 is the coupling strength to the spin baths ; @xmath23 and @xmath21 give the driving strength : in the main cases considered here , we model the baths in terms of extra spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 linked to the chain , and , in such situation , @xmath23 and @xmath21 describe different spin polarization at the boundaries : precisely , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . written in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the expression for the dissipator @xmath15 becomes @xmath32\\right .",

    "the derivation of the lindblad master equation above is straightforward .",
    "for example , one may use the repeated interactions scheme as minutely described in appendices a and b of ref.@xcite .",
    "the procedure starts by taking an enlarged chain with two extra spins , labeled @xmath33 and @xmath34 , coupled to the boundaries of the original chain , i.e. , to spins @xmath35 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian for the total enlarged system , as well as the time evolution , is determined after choosing some coupling interaction between the extra spins and the chain .",
    "it is assumed that in the initial time @xmath36 the baths ( extra spins ) are decoupled from the chain , so that the total density matrix factorizes as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the density matrices for the extra spins @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the whole system ( now with the extra spins ) is allowed to evolve up to some time @xmath40 .",
    "then , the extra spins are `` discarded '' by taking a partial trace over @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which leads to a new density matrix @xmath41 .",
    "new extra spins are taken from the baths and a new enlarged density matrix is built , as at time @xmath36 , with @xmath42 .",
    "the process is repeated up to a time @xmath43 , and so on . taking",
    "the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 obtained with the scheme and some further manipulations , dividing the difference @xmath46 $ ] by @xmath40 , and taking the limit @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 and the lindblad master equation .",
    "see ref.@xcite for a complete and detailed derivation .    to obtain the steady state ,",
    "i.e. , the stationary density matrix @xmath49 , reached as @xmath50 , we turn to the solution of eq.([master ] ) with @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 + \\mathcal{l}(\\rho_{s } ) \\equiv \\mathcal{m } \\rho_{s } ~.\\ ] ] in other words , the nonequilibrium stationary state is given by the kernel ( null space ) of the linear operator @xmath53 .",
    "now , for convenience , we introduce the linear transformation @xmath54 , the vectorization of a matrix @xmath55 , which converts the matrix @xmath55 into a column vector . precisely , @xmath56 ~~\\rightarrow",
    "vec(a ) = \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } a \\\\ c \\\\ b \\\\ d \\end{array } \\right ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as well known , several properties follow for the vectorization , such as the compatibility with kronecker products , namely , @xmath57    next , we take the vectorization of the density matrix and related operators in the lindblad master equation ( [ master ] ) . from eqs.([master ] , [ dissipator ] ) , it is clear that the r.h.s .",
    "of the lindblad master equation is written in terms of products of matrices @xmath58 such as @xmath59 ( note that terms like @xmath60 and @xmath61 may be seen as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the identity matrix ) .",
    "let us use the notation @xmath65 for the vector @xmath66 with @xmath67 coordinates .",
    "hence , the new notation for the master equation becomes @xmath68 where , we stress , the linear operator @xmath69 acts on a vector space of dimension @xmath67 , i.e. , it is a @xmath70 matrix . as already said , the stationary state @xmath71 is given by the eigenvector of @xmath69 with eigenvalue zero . for the particular lindblad master equation considered here , general results @xcite guarantee that the remaining eigenvalues of @xmath69 have negative real parts , and so , as @xmath50 , our system reaches indeed the stationary state .",
    "within such an approach , we may ( in principle ) find exact results .",
    "however , the size of @xmath69 rapidly increases with @xmath3 , making difficult even numerical computations in large systems , in particular for inhomogeneous ( graded ) models . recalling that one of our main motivations is the investigation of a possible extension to graded quantum systems of the ubiquitous occurrence of energy rectification found in general anharmonic classical models with graded structures , we restrict the investigation to small chains , with @xmath3 up to @xmath72 .",
    "it is important to mention that the study of small systems , minimalistic mathematical prototypes or toy models may provide key information in physics . in a similar context ,",
    "we recall , for example , that the existence of thermal rectification in the quantum graded chain of harmonic oscillators with inner baths ( in contrast with absence in the classical model ) has been first discovered in a chain with 3 sites only @xcite , and then confirmed in larger chains by means of numerical computations in a further work @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the spin and energy currents follow from the dynamics , i.e. , from the lindblad master equation ( [ master ] ) which gives the time evolution , and from continuity equations . for the magnetization flow , these continuity equations are @xmath73 hence , as said , using the master equation , setting @xmath74 , and the continuity equations above , we obtain @xmath75    in the steady state we observe a homogeneous flow through the chain , namely , @xmath76    to describe the energy current , as performed in ref.@xcite , we first split the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ( with @xmath77 ) as @xmath78~,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , we separate the part related to the xxz interaction from the part associated with the external magnetic field . for the inner sites , @xmath79 , taking again the time evolution given by the master equation and the continuity equation @xmath80 we obtain , for the energy current ,",

    "as said above about the hamiltonian , it is also convenient to split the energy current as @xmath84 for the xxz contribution , we have ( for @xmath85 ) @xmath86 \\rangle = \\ldots } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 2\\alpha \\langle \\alpha \\left ( \\sigma_{j-1}^{y}\\sigma_{j}^{z } \\sigma_{j+1}^{x } - \\sigma_{j-1}^{x}\\sigma_{j}^{z}\\sigma_{j+1}^{y}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta_{j-1,j}\\left ( \\sigma_{j-1}^{z}\\sigma_{j}^{x } \\sigma_{j+1}^{y } - \\sigma_{j-1}^{z}\\sigma_{j}^{y}\\sigma_{j+1}^{x}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta_{j , j+1}\\left ( \\sigma_{j-1}^{x}\\sigma_{j}^{y } \\sigma_{j+1}^{z } - \\sigma_{j-1}^{y}\\sigma_{j}^{x}\\sigma_{j+1}^{z}\\right)\\rangle   ~.\\label{jxxz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , again for @xmath85 , @xmath87 - [ h_{j-1,j } , h_{j , j+1 } ] \\rangle = \\ldots   \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{2 }",
    "b_{j}\\langle j_{j-1 } + j_{j}\\rangle ~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the spin current , previously described .    for the sites at the boundaries",
    ", we have    @xmath89    note that , from the expressions given above , the energy current @xmath90 is related to the spin current @xmath91 as @xmath92    in some cases , we can describe properties of the currents _ a priori _ ,",
    "i.e. , before the explicit computations with the steady density matrix .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite , popkov and livi show that arguments of symmetry in open spin chains with general assumptions about baths and interactions , may be used to prove the vanishing of energy and/or spin currents in some cases , despite the presence of large boundary gradients .",
    "see also ref.@xcite for similar considerations and other interesting qualitative arguments for the study of currents in the homogeneous ( nongraded ) xxz chain .",
    "now , we follow such strategy to establish some properties of the currents ( results which are confirmed later by direct algebraic computation ) , and also to make transparent the difference between the homogeneous and the graded versions of the xxz chain . for clearness and completeness",
    ", we repeat some arguments already presented in these references @xcite .    to start with the arguments of symmetry , we first turn to the time evolution given by the lindblad master equation ( [ master ] ) . denoting the right - hand side of eq.([master ] ) by @xmath93 , we observe that if a unitary transformation @xmath94 leaves @xmath93 invariant , i.e. , if @xmath95 , then @xmath96 becomes a new solution of eq.([master ] ) . consequently , for a system with a unique steady state @xmath49 , it follows that @xmath97 .",
    "and so , for any physical observable @xmath98 measured in the steady state , we have @xmath99 if @xmath98 also presents some symmetry under the action of @xmath94 , for example , if @xmath100 , then we have @xmath101 , and so , @xmath102 .",
    "i.e. , the average of @xmath98 must vanish in the steady state .",
    "let us analyze the simpler case of the homogeneous xxz chain ( i.e. , @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) in the absence of the external magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the transformation @xmath105 leaves @xmath93 invariant , where @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the reflection operator @xmath109 ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "and so , @xmath110 .",
    "it can be also verified that @xmath111 changes sign under @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath113 , and so , for the homogeneous xxz chain , in the absence of external magnetic field , the total energy current vanishes in the steady state : @xmath114 ( see eq.([flows ] ) ) .    if we introduce a homogeneous magnetic field in the chain , @xmath115 , as explained in ref.@xcite , the spin current ( see eq.([spinc ] ) ) @xmath116 which is given by processes conserving the number of spin excitations , is not affected .",
    "similarly , @xmath117 is given by terms such as ( see eq.([jxxz ] ) ) @xmath118 and so , it is also independent of the external magnetic field . in conclusion , for the homogeneous xxz chain in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath5 , as @xmath119 , we have @xmath120 that is , the total energy current is ruled by the spin current .",
    "however , with the introduction of a graded structure in the xxz , i.e. , turning to the graded xxz model , the picture changes .",
    "for example , in the case of a system in which @xmath121 increases with @xmath12 , it is evident that the reflection @xmath108 completely modifies the hamiltonian @xmath122 ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and so , @xmath93 loses its invariance under the transformation @xmath123 .",
    "that is , the symmetry property @xmath124 is lost , and we can not say that @xmath125 vanishes in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath5 anymore . in fact , this imbalance of energy in the interaction due to the increasing of @xmath121 with @xmath12 indicates a preferential direction for the energy flow , and , even for @xmath126 , @xmath127 is not expected to vanish .",
    "moreover , for @xmath126 the effect of the asymmetry in @xmath121 does not change if we invert the signs of all @xmath128 , i.e. , the direction of increasing energy interaction is not affected ( as well known , @xmath129 , for @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , in a graded chain in which the driving strength is @xmath130 for the left end and @xmath131 for the right one , or in the same graded chain with inverted baths ( i.e , with @xmath131 at left end and @xmath130 at right one ) , the energy flow and its direction will be the same . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "@xmath5 , this picture is spoiled , but , anyway , we have the occurrence of energy rectification , i.e. , a preferential direction for the current .",
    "let us make transparent this very important point .",
    "note that , from eq.([flows ] ) , in the steady state and in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field we have @xmath132 , with @xmath133 an even function of @xmath130 , as argued above , and @xmath134 an odd function of @xmath130 ( the spin current direction is determined by the direction of the magnetization imbalance ) .",
    "hence , the energy rectification ( change in the magnitude of @xmath135 as we invert the baths ) is clear : if we invert the sign of @xmath130 , only one term of @xmath135 changes the sign .    as a further comment ,",
    "it is worth stressing that the symmetry arguments above ( dependence on @xmath130 ) are not related to the size of the chain , and so , they indicate the occurrence of rectification in larger chains once proved its existence in small systems , which is minutely described ahead .    in the next section",
    ", we confirm this scenario predicted by symmetry considerations and present more new information with the description of the currents computed from the steady density matrix .",
    "before describing our findings from the computation work , it is wort recalling some recent results about rectification ( but of the spin current ) in homogeneous xxz chains . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors show the existence of spin current rectification in the homogeneous xxz chain ( with @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) under an inhomogeneous , linearly graded , magnetic field for small chains , up to @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , they show the vanishing of rectification as @xmath139 , i.e. , for the xx chain , and emphasize the correspondence to the well known result of absence of ( energy ) rectification in classical harmonic chains : written in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , the xx model contains only quadratic terms , whereas the xxz model involves also a quartic term which is proportional to @xmath140 .    turning to our results ,",
    "we first describe the solutions for the graded xxz chain under a homogeneous magnetic field . given the huge algebraic computation , we start with a small chain , with @xmath141 and with the dissipator targeting values of the @xmath142-spin at the boundaries - see eqs.([hamiltonian ] , [ dissipator2 ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the final expressions for the currents in the steady state are presented in the appendix . analyzing the formulas",
    ", we note that , as expected , we may split the expression for the energy current as @xmath132 . for @xmath126",
    ", we have that @xmath135 becomes an even function of @xmath130 , the driving strength , and it vanishes as @xmath145 , i.e. , without the graded asymmetry . on the other side ,",
    "still for @xmath126 , the energy flow does not vanish in the graded chain ( @xmath146 ) , and its direction is determined by the graded asymmetry : it does not depend on the direction of the driving strength , which , however , gives the direction of the spin current .    with the introduction of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath5 , as in the non - graded @xmath140 case , the spin current does not change , whereas the energy current is modified .",
    "again , as previously predicted and discussed , there is rectification for the energy , but not for the spin current . in the present paper ,",
    "we define the rectification factor as the difference between the energy flow in a given situation and the related flow as we invert the baths , divided by the smallest of the flows .",
    "thinking about percentage , we multiply the expression by 100 , precisely , @xmath147 such a definition is usual in the related study of rectification in classical anharmonic chains of oscillators , and its meaning is clear : if , for instance , the flow in a given direction is twice the flow in the inverted chain , we obtain @xmath148 , which means a difference of @xmath149 .",
    "as described by the formulas in the appendix , the energy current , as well as the magnetization flow , depends on several parameters ( @xmath150 ) , which leads to a very varied scenario . as illustration , we plot some curves to visualize the behavior of the energy rectification below , considering different parameters and/or regions .",
    "see fig.1 for the energy rectification versus the driving strength @xmath130 for different values of @xmath140 .",
    "we recall that for large , homogeneous chains , the cases @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) describe different situations : in the absence of a magnetic field , the ground state diagram of this model engenders a gapped phase for @xmath151 , and a gapless one for @xmath152 , with consequences on the transport properties @xcite .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the energy rectification versus the interaction asymmetry @xmath154 , for different values of external magnetic field @xmath5 .     and graded interaction between @xmath155 and @xmath156 . here , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and graded interaction between @xmath155 and @xmath156 . here , @xmath158 , @xmath160 , @xmath161.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to make clear that the energy rectification remains for different system sizes , we describe below the rectification factor in the cases @xmath162 , for @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and different asymmetry parameter @xmath154 .",

    "in conclusion , by studying several types of graded xxz models ( and in different situations ) , we observe the generic occurrence of energy rectification , even under a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "we recall that energy rectification is a ubiquitous phenomenon in classical systems @xcite represented by classical anharmonic chains of oscillators , and also recall that these xxz models , in a representation in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , involve quartic ( anharmonic ) terms .",
    "thus , in some way , the present work extends the ubiquity of the energy rectification occurrence in graded anharmonic materials to quantum spin systems .",
    "some final comments , regarding future investigations , seem appropriate .",
    "first , we remark the importance of further studies concerning rectification properties in larger systems in order to investigate , for example , possible decays with the system size .",
    "we also remark the interest of further analysis considering the energy transport in the spin chain submitted to an energy imbalance at the boundaries ( instead of the magnetization imbalance treated here ) .",
    "finally , we recall recent studies of classical anharmonic graded chains of oscillators with long range interactions , feature which significatively amplifies the rectification factor and avoids its decay with the system size @xcite , in order to announce the investigation of the graded xxz with long range interactions as a promising problem . again",
    ", we stress that it is an issue of theoretical and experimental interest , since related models with long range interactions describe important real materials , as we may confirm with some well known examples : coulomb crystals given by a trapped beryllium system , present candidates for many - qubit processors , may be engineered to exhibit ising - like interactions with @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the distance between spin pairs and @xmath208 @xcite ; nanomagnets such as permalloy may be lithographically manipulated to present different structures ( e.g. spin ice ) , and their interactions typically decay as @xmath209 , where @xmath210 denotes the distance between two nanodisks @xcite .",
    "we list here some complete expressions obtained for the energy and spin currents , for @xmath141 and dissipators targeting the average values of the spin @xmath128 at the boundaries ( denoted by @xmath130 ) ; see sec.ii . for simplicity , we take the coupling strength @xmath211 . for the case of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath5 and graded interaction @xmath140 ,",
