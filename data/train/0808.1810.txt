    "when some disorders are introduced in mott insulators or charge - ordered insulators , disorder - induced electronic states are often observed within the band gaps and are responsible for the hopping transport in the insulating phase .",
    "@xcite although it is very important to understand the relationship between the transport behaviors and the disorder - induced in - gap states , no unified picture on the relationship is obtained so far .",
    "for example , in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath1 , @xcite nis@xmath6se@xmath7 , @xcite and r@xmath8a@xmath7mno@xmath9 , @xcite almost localized electronic states are formed within the band gap and are responsible for the variable range hopping ( vrh ) transport . on the other hand , in lightly - doped la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath1  ( @xmath10=0.03 ) , a sharp peak with clear band dispersion is observed within the mott gap while the resistivity shows a vrh behavior .",
    "@xcite the vrh transports and in - gap states suggest that the insulating and metallic clusters coexist near the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in these materials .",
    "@xcite such inhomogeneity plays crucial roles in their remarkable properties of colossal magnetoresistance and photo - induced mit in manganites , @xcite and stripe formation in cuprates .",

    "the symmetry of crystal is changed from triclinic to tetragonal by the irradiation and the photo - induced state has a long lifetime .",
    "it has been proposed that the photo - excitation breaks the ir@xmath2/ir@xmath3 charge ordering and induces the metallic conductivity .",

    "the opening of the gap @xmath39 @xmath23 0.09 ev , obtained by extrapolating the slope near the valance - band maximum to the base line , agrees with the previous photoemission results @xcite and is attributed to the ir@xmath2/ir@xmath3 charge ordering and ir@xmath3-ir@xmath3 dimerization along the @xmath22 chains with the tetragonal distortion .",

    "although the spectra show the band - gap opening , a hump structure near @xmath5 remains even at the lowest temperature @xmath23 20 k in contrast to the spectra for sample @xmath33 measured immediately after cleaving at 20 k. sample @xmath32 was also cleaved at 300 k and then measured with decreasing temperature .",

    "even at 20 k , the intensity of the hump depends on the cleavage . while , for sample @xmath34 cleaved at 20 k , the hump",
    "was clearly observed , its intensity was very small for sample @xmath35 .",
    "the hump structure is probably due to the surface state composed of unpaired ir@xmath3 at the surface .",
    "thus the hump structure can be affected by various surface conditions including treatments such as cleaving , change of temperature or irradiation from he i source .",

    "therefore , we can safely conclude that , while the hump near @xmath5 is the surface contributions , the in - gap state with the power law function @xmath42 with @xmath44 @xmath23 @xmath52 - @xmath53 is derived from the bulk and is responsible for the vrh transport , @xmath12 exp[@xmath13 ( or @xmath54 @xmath55exp@xmath16 + @xmath56exp[@xmath18 ) .        ccccc + sample ( 20 k ) & @xmath44 & @xmath17 & @xmath46 ( ev ) & @xmath47 ( ev ) + @xmath31 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath59 + @xmath32 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath50 & @xmath50 + @xmath33 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath50 + @xmath34 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath59 & @xmath64 + @xmath35 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath64 & @xmath59 +    [ t2 ]    in the situation forming @xmath4 due to electron - electron coulomb repulsion of efros - shklovskii type , the spectral function is usually characterized by @xmath67 dependence .",
    "@xcite however cuir@xmath0s@xmath1 has complicated three - dimensional charge order and has @xmath68 @xmath23 0.09 ev . probably , some disorder in the charge - ordered state is the origin of the in - gap spectral feature and the vrh transport .",
    "recently based on transport measurements of ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath1 , nakatsuji _ et al . _",
    "proposed that the hopping exponent of @xmath69 @xmath23 1/2 is universal feature of the disordered mott system close to the metal - insulator transition and reflects the emergence of disorder - induced localized electronic states in the mott - hubbard gap .",
