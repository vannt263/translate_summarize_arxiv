    "2003 ) .    to summarize ,",
    "after a brief ( but we can not exclude that the outburst was ongoing for many days before the discovery of the source ) initial hs ,  underwent a smooth transition to the is , followed by transitions to the spl state , the td state and then back to the hs .",
    "our radio observations occurred as followed : # 1 and 2 during the initial hs ( however , # 2 is very close from the transition to the is ) , # 3 and 4 during the spl state ( however , # 4 is very close from the transition to the td state ) , # 5 and 6 during the td state and # 7 and 8 during the final hs .",
    "a ninth observation was performed later when   was back in quiescence .",
    "we now describe the properties of  along these x - ray states .",
    "we now focus on the properties of the radio emission .",
    "we obtained radio coverage during the initial and final hard states , the steep power - law state and the thermal dominant state . by looking at table 1 and fig .",
    "3 , where the radio light curve of   is plotted , we note that radio emission from  is detected during the first radio observation on september 7 with a spectrum consistent with being flat between 1384 and 2496 mhz .",
    "the day after , the radio flux density increased by almost a factor of two with similar spectral characteristics . on september 24",
    ", we observed the source at a much fainter radio flux ( @xmath3 0.8 mjy ) , and the source disappeared below the sensitivity level on october 5 with three sigma upper limits of 0.21 and 0.18 mjy at 4800 and 8640 mhz , respectively . compared to the brightest level of radio emission observed on september 8 ,",
    "this indicates a significant quenching ( of more than a factor 25 ) of the radio emission . surprisingly , radio emission is again observed ( obs . # 5 and 6 ) at the mjy level in the td state ( contrary to expectations based on observations of other bhcs , e.g. , fender et al . 1999 ; corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) . during the final two radio observations ,",
    "the behavior of the source may be consistent with the behavior during the first two observations .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we define the radio spectral index , @xmath2 , as s@xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 , where s@xmath9 is the radio flux density and @xmath12 is the frequency .    the best position of the radio counterpart to  ( with the radio source fitted as a point - like source ) is : @xmath2(j2000 ) = 16@xmath1350@xmath1400.96@xmath15 and @xmath16(j2000 ) = 4957 44.60  with an absolute positional uncertainty of 0.25 , mostly due to the uncertainty on the phase calibrator position .",
    "all radio observations ( when the radio source is detected ) are consistent with a location of the radio counterpart at this position .",
    "this constitutes the most accurate position for , and is in agreement with the one derived from optical observations ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "2001 ) and _ chandra _ observations ( tomsick et al . 2004 ) .",
    "radio observations # 1 , 2 , 7 and 8 were performed while  was in the hs .",
    "both the initial and final hard x - ray states are therefore covered . once again , the overall properties of the hard state radio emission are broadly consistent with those that have been observed in other bhcs in a similar x - ray state ( corbel et al . 2000 ; fender 2001 ) : a level of radio emission of a few mjys with a radio spectrum that is almost flat .",
    "such characteristics are believed to originate from a self - absorbed conical outflow or compact jet ( e.g. blandford & k@xmath17nigl 1979 or hjellming & johnson 1988 ) , similar to the one directly resolved from  by stirling et al .",
    "we do not detect linear polarization from the compact jet of , with our best 3 @xmath18 upper limit of 4.0% or 4.7% at 4800 or 8640 mhz , respectively .",
    "such limits are consistent with previous detections at lower levels ( e.g. corbel et al . 2000 for ) .    for the purpose of our discussion ,",
    "we have calculated the radio spectral indeces , and these are included in table 1 . despite being consistent with flat ( @xmath2 @xmath3 0 ) , the radio spectrum ( e.g. fig .",
    "4 ) seems less inverted at high radio frequencies than is typical for bhc systems .",
    "later , we will come back to the last observation on december 4 , which shows a very unusual spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to note that the radio spectrum on september 8 ( observation # 2 : figure 4 ) shows a turnover at lower frequencies . this could be due to free - free absorption by a thermal plasma , and , indeed , a fit to the spectrum with a power law and free - free absorption ( s@xmath9 = s@xmath19 @xmath11 exp(-@xmath20 @xmath21 ) , where s@xmath19 is the amplitude at 1 ghz , @xmath2 is the spectral index of the un - absorbed spectrum and @xmath20 is the free - free optical depth at 1 ghz ) describes the data sufficiently well with s@xmath19 = 8.59 @xmath4 0.07 mjy , @xmath2 = 0.29 @xmath4 0.04 and @xmath20 = 1.32 @xmath4 0.02 .",
    "the opacity is in the range of values obtained by fender ( 2001 ) for the 1989 outburst of v404  cyg ( gs  2023@xmath1338 ) ( han & hjellming 1992 ) .",
    "we note that similarly , during the first detection of xte  j1859@xmath1226 in 1999 , the radio spectrum also shows absorption at low frequency ( brocksopp et al .",
    "2002 ) while in the hs .",
    "if the radio emission arises from a compact jet ( as is usually observed in the hs ) , then it is unlikely that synchrotron self - absorption is responsible for the observed absorption at low - frequency as this emission originates from large scale regions ( see fender 2001 ) .",
    "the nature of the putative thermal absorbing plasma is unclear ( higher ism density , remnant of past activity , etc . ) . alternatively ( but probably less plausibly ) , the radio spectrum could be caused by two components : a flat component from the compact jet as well as a second component from an optically - thick ejection event .",
    "this may be a possibility as radio observation # 2 occurred very close to the hard to intermediate state transition .",
    "however , this is not favored by the fact that the radio spectra are all consistent with having the same intrinsic spectral index , even during the final hs ( with the exception of observations # 8) .",
    "also , as discussed below , if an ejection event occurred for , it probably took place during the intermediate to steep power - law state transition ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "we note that the radio spectrum in observation # 8 is very steep ( @xmath2 @xmath22 1.3 ) , and this is unusual for a black hole in the hs .",
    "it is not clear if this is related to the jet / ism interaction mentioned below ( likely not , as the spectrum in observation # 7 looks similar to the initial hs ) or possibly to the x - ray oscillation behavior observed ten days later ( tomsick et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "as discussed above , we obtained the best constraint on the spectral index during the september 8 observation with @xmath2 = 0.29 @xmath4 0.04 .",
    "the reason the radio spectrum may be less inverted than usual is still unclear .",
    "this may be related to the inclination angle of the jet as usually lower inclination angles lead to flatter spectra ( e.g. falcke 1996 ) .",
    "for example , the radio to millimeter spectrum of the compact jet of  ( a low inclination system ) is almost flat , i.e. @xmath2 @xmath3 0 ( fender et al .",
    "however , even with a low inclination angle of the jet , it is almost impossible to obtain such a negative spectral index .",
    "furthermore , optical observations indicate that the inclination angle of the orbital plane in  is at least 50  ( orosz et al . 2004 ) , so this explanation does not work for  unless the compact jets are strongly misaligned with the orbital plane ( as might be the case in few systems , maccarone 2002 ) .",
    "additionally , we note that even in a system such as 4u  1543@xmath047 with a low inclination angle ( 20.7 @xmath4 1.0 , orosz et al . in prep . ) , the radio spectrum of the compact jet ( e.g. @xmath2 = 0.08 @xmath4 0.04 ) is still slightly inverted ( kalemci et al .",
    "we also note that the spectral index also vary within a single source ( e.g. , corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) , so it is unlikely that the inclination angle is responsible for this less inverted radio spectrum .    according to hjellming & johnston ( 1988 ) , a less inverted radio spectrum would also be expected in the case of slowed lateral expansion by an external medium ( i.e. a compact jet with a narrower opening angle ) .",
    "in addition , due to the longitudinal pressure gradient , the bulk lorentz factor will increase along the jet axis .",
    "if the observer is looking into the jet boosting cone , then one would expect to see an increase in low frequencies radio emission ( which originates far from the base of the jet ) and therefore possibly a much less inverted radio spectrum ( e.g. falcke 1996 ) .",
    "obscuration of part of the receding jet may also contribute to the nature of the spectrum . in any case",
    ", a combination of all these effects may be in place in .",
    "it is also clear that future studies of the evolution of the radio spectral index of the compact jets in bhc systems are important as they may shed light of the geometry of the system .",
    "if the measured spectral index is correct , then it is likely that the contribution from the compact jet at higher frequencies will not be significant .",
    "as illustrated in   and , the spectrum of the compact jet extends to shorter wavelengths , with a transition to optically thin regime in near infrared ( corbel et al .",
    "2001 ; corbel & fender 2002 ) . in that case , it is unlikely that an infrared re - flare would have been detected during the soft to hard state transition as in ,  or 4u  1543@xmath047 ( jain et al .",
    "2001 ; buxton & bailyn 2003 ) .",
    "the contribution in x - rays , as direct synchrotron emission ( c.f .",
    "markoff , falcke , fender 2001 ; markoff et al .",
    "2003 ) may also be negligible ( see section 3.1.2 ) , however a contribution as synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission from the base of the compact jet ( e.g. markoff & nowak 2004 ) can not be ruled out at this stage .      while in the hs",
    ", black hole candidates display a strong correlation between their radio and x - ray emission .",
    "this was first observed in  ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ; 2003 ) over more than three orders of magnitude in x - ray flux and almost down to its quiescence level .",
    "gallo , fender , & pooley ( 2003 ) found a similar correlation for  ( v404 cyg ) , but , interestingly , they show that all bhcs in the the hs behave similarly , i.e. their data are consistent with a universal relation between radio and x - ray luminosities .",
    "they also observed a relatively small scatter of approximately one order of magnitude in radio power .",
    "in fact , the scatter could be even smaller if we account for the recent distance estimate , in the range between 6 and 15 kpc , for  by hynes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) as this will bring   closer to , and the small scatter could imply low bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath23 2 ) for the compact jets .",
    "interestingly , this correlation also seems to hold for a large sample of super - massive black holes if one take into account the mass of the black hole as an additional correction ( merloni , heinz , & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding , & markoff 2004 ) .    in order to see",
    "if  fits into this picture , we looked at the relationship between the x - ray and radio flux levels for . despite our efforts to get quasi - simultaneous x - ray and atca observations ( see table 1 ) , this was not possible for the final hs as  was in the solar exclusion zone for _ rxte_. in figure 5 , we plot the x - ray flux in various bands during a portion of the decay of the 2001 outburst ( see also tomsick et al 2003b , 2004 ) . after the transition to the hs ( on mjd 52232 , kalemci et al .",
    "2004a ) , the decay is smooth enough that interpolation of the x - ray flux at the time of the radio observation is sufficient to obtain an estimate .",
    "we note that an increase of the decay rate is observed at the end of the outburst ( figure 5 ) with a spectrum that gets harder with time ( a smooth variation of the photon index : 1.91 @xmath4 0.02 on mjd 52235.6 to 1.35 @xmath4 0.23 on mjd 52267.9 ) , very similar to the decay of xte  j1908@xmath1094 during its 2003 outburst ( jonker et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in figure 6",
    ", we have plotted the radio flux density at 4.8 ghz versus the unabsorbed 211 kev x - ray flux ( in crab units ) scaled to a distance of 1 kpc ( similar to gallo et al .",
    "2003 ) , assuming a distance of 3 kpc for .",
    "this distance gives luminosity estimates during the state transition consistent with other bhcs ( maccarone 2003 ) . in fig .",
    "6 , we have also plotted the best - fit function obtained by gallo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using their datasets , i.e. s@xmath24 with k = 223 @xmath4 156 mjy .",
    "although we have a sample of only four data points , we can clearly see that they all lie significantly below ( by a factor 20 ) the best - fit line of gallo et al .",
    "the determination of the slope of the power - law function linking the radio and x - ray emission is very uncertain due to our limited sample of data points ( as well as the unusual radio spectrum in observation # 8 and the fact that two observations took place very close to state transitions ) .",
    "the reason why the normalization in  is significantly lower ( the source is less radio loud or more x - ray loud ) than in other bhcs ( gallo et al . 2003 ) is still unclear .",
    "it may be related to the fact that direct synchrotron x - ray emission ( and possibly even ssc ) from the compact jets is likely not dominant in the case of  for a reason which still remains to be explained .",
    "the lower normalization in  could be related to the fact that the x - ray regime may be dominated by thermal comptonization of disk photons in the corona .",
    "we note that the distance to  may be larger than 3 kpc , but this will only make  more anomalous relative to the other bhcs .        as outlined above , after a few days in the hard state ,  entered the intermediate state and then went into the steep power - law state . in the",
    "is , the x - ray spectrum softens gradually until the photon index reaches a value of @xmath32.2 ( rossi et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas the qpo frequency increases from 1 hz to 8.5 hz . then ( spl state ) , the photon index , and the qpo frequency ( it is not clear if this is the same type of qpo ) oscillate around their saturation value .",
    "this behavior is more pronounced for the qpo frequency as it fluctuates along with the broad - band variability .",
    "the slow variations of the photon index could be related to cooling of the corona by an increase in the number of soft disk photons ( the inner accretion disk could get closer to the black hole ) .",
    "significant variations are also observed in the total disk flux contribution ( rossi et al .",
    "2003 ) and may indicate that the accretion disk has reached the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and is oscillating around this value .",
    "this interval ( spl state ) also corresponds to the period over which high frequency qpos are detected and therefore confirms that the disk is very close to the black hole ( homan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we conducted two radio observations during the spl state of  in 2001 .",
    "the first one resulted in the detection of  at a faint level of @xmath30.8 mjy ( the spectral index is not well constrained : @xmath2 = 0.13 @xmath4 0.86 ) .",
    "the second observation did not result in a detection of  with 3 @xmath18 upper limits of 0.18 mjy at 8640 mhz and 0.21 mjy at 4800 mhz , indicating a significant ( more than a factor 25 ) quenching of radio emission compared to the initial hs .",
    "very few soft x - ray transients have been observed at radio frequencies during the intermediate or steep power - law states .",
    "moreover , when this state has been observed , the radio emission has usually been dominated by the decaying optically thin synchrotron emission arising from jet ejections that occurred at or near state transitions prior to the source entering the intermediate or steep power - law state .",
    "thus , when the emission from the jet ejections is detected , it is decoupled from the black hole system , implying that the observed radio emission is not an intrinsic property of the intermediate or steep power - law states as the emitting electrons are already far from the system .",
    "there is only one case for which the radio observations sampled the intrinsic properties of the intermediate or steep power - law states :  during its reactivation in 2000 ( corbel et al .",
    "interestingly , the properties of the radio emission from  were quite similar to what we observe now in : indeed , for , the first detection showed an optically thin spectrum with a well - constrained spectral index of @xmath2 = 0.45 @xmath4 0.05 , while , later , the radio emission was quenched .",
    "the optically thin component was interpreted as synchrotron emission arising from relativistic plasma during the state transition .",
    "such small ejection events are frequently observed during state transitions ( e.g. see fender et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or corbel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the 1998 outburst of  or brocksopp et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the 2003 outburst of xte  j1720@xmath0318 ) .",
    "we note that the spectacular massive ejection events ( with bright radio emission and a radio core that is usually resolved on a time - scale of weeks ; e.g. mirabel & rodr ' iguez ( 1994 ) for ) may be related to sharper state transition possibly related to a huge increase in the accretion rate in the inner part of the accretion disk or maybe to a different black hole parameter such as the spin .    furthermore , we highlight the fact that during the 1999 outburst of xte  j1859@xmath1226 , brocksopp et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported the detection of flaring radio emission from this black hole in a soft state , which is unexpected in the canonical high / soft ( or td ) state ( e.g. fender et al .",
    "1999 ) . in that case , the radio flaring emission was clearly associated with spectral hardening of the x - ray spectrum . however , their definition of a soft state is not clear .",
    "indeed , the hard x - ray light - curve in brocksopp et al .",
    "( 2002 ) revealed a very significant level of hard x - ray emission up to at least mjd 51490 , which is very uncommon for a td state ( e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , cui et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported the detection of high frequency qpos around mjd 51468 , which is a characteristic of the spl state ( mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) , this is also favored by the large fraction of the x - ray flux in the power - law component ( hynes et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is also quite steep .",
    "kalemci ( 2002 ) , analyzing the _ rxte_/pca data of xte  j1859@xmath1226 after mjd 51515 , describes the spectral state evolution as : a td state from mjd 51515 up to mjd 51524 , after which the system was found in the is for the remaining pca observations .",
    "based on the above , it seems likely that the td state in xte  j1859@xmath1226 did not start before mjd 51490 .",
    "this is confirmed by markwardt ( 2001 ) as this work indicates that the disc component became dominant only after mjd 51487 .",
    "therefore , the x - ray state in which brocksopp et al .",
    "( 2002 ) detected flaring radio emission from xte  j1859@xmath1226 was most likely the spl state ( or less possibly an is ) and not a td state .",
    "therefore , the observed radio flaring behavior in xte  j1859@xmath1226 must be related to the behavior of bhcs while in the spl state .",
    "this conclusion has also been drawn by fender , belloni & gallo ( 2004 ) .      with our new observations ,",
    "is therefore the third source for which the intrinsic radio properties of the spl state have been sampled , and the observed behavior is consistent with what has been found in  ( corbel et al .",
    "the detection of the faint radio component in the spl state on september 24 ( observation # 3 ) may be related to an ejection event at the time of the transition from the hard to intermediate states ( on september 9 ) . however , as there is significant time ( 15 days ) between the transition and the detection of the faint radio component , we consider two alternative explanations .",
    "first , an interesting comparison can be made with the 2002 - 2003 outburst of  as a strong radio flare has been observed with atca ( gallo et al .",
    "2004 ) . in fig .",
    "7 , we have plotted the asm light - curve and hardness ratio ( similar to fig . 1 for ) for the initial part of the outburst .",
    "as  and  have similar hydrogen column density ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2004 ) , we can directly compare their hardness ratios , which are indeed very similar ( figs . 1 and 7 ) .",
    "after an initial hs ,   made a transition to an is around mjd 52400 .",
    "then , the spectrum softened up to approximately mjd 52409 , when  is found in the spl state , the evolution of the states became more complicated later on in the outburst ( t. belloni , private communication ) .",
    "the spectral state evolution ( during the beginning of the outburst ) in  is therefore identical to .",
    "the radio flare observed by gallo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) started on 2002 , may 14 around 13:00 ( mjd 52409.042 ) , reaching its maximum 6 hours later .",
    "the arrow in figure 7 indicates that the radio flare started once the softening of the x - ray spectrum ended , i.e. it would correspond to the transition from the is to the spl state .",
    "based on the above , and comparing their hardness ratios , we can say that if a radio flare ( and hence massive plasma ejection ) occurred in , then this happens at the transition between is and spl state . in that case",
    ", the observed radio emission on september 24 would be the end of the decay of this flare .",
    "this may constitute the ejected materials that may be interacting later with the interstellar medium ( section 3.3 ) as in  ( gallo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , an equally plausible explanation is the following .",
    "the transition from the is to the spl states seems to correspond to a period over which the inner radius of the accretion disk reaches the isco , and this would be valid for most of the spl state as outlined above in section 3.2.1 . as the x - ray properties of the spl state favor an `` unstable '' accretion disk ( rossi et al . 2003 ) , they may suggest that the optically thin synchrotron component observed on september 24 could be related to an ejection of a very small portion of the inner accretion disk or corona . in that case",
    ", it would be very similar to the radio flaring behavior observed in xte  j1859@xmath1226 during its spl state in 1999 or to the behavior observed in  ( but at much slower rate ) .",
    "the comparison of   with bhcs in canonical x - ray states is not straightforward , but the x - ray states a , b ( soft ) and c ( hard ) may be similar to intermediate and very high states ( reig , belloni & van der klis 2003 ) .",
    "oscillations between states a , b and c are correlated with radio flaring activity ( e.g. klein - wolt et al . 2002 ) with stronger radio emission in the spectrally hard state c , whereas the soft states are never associated with bright radio emission .",
    "these two possible explanations for the origin of radio emission in the is and spl state could be combined as follows . for  and probably for , the transition from is to spl state is associated with an ejection event ( with a radio spectrum characteristic of optically thin synchrotron emission ) that decays on a time - scale of hours .",
    "after the transition , the accretion disk settles down close to the isco . at that time , as the spectrum hardens , accretion disk or coronal material can be ejected from the system ( as in xte  j1859@xmath1226 ) , resulting in weak radio flares . if the radio observation takes place between two flares , then no radio emission would be observed .",
    "indeed , this was also the case for : after the major radio flare associated with the is - spl state transition , several radio flares were observed during the spl state ( gallo et al .",
    "2004 ) , and , interestingly , for at least one spl state radio observation ( on 2002 june 9 = mjd 52434 ) , the radio emission was quenched ( by a factor @xmath5 45 compared to the initial hs ) .",
    "indeed , we can now try to see if the 2000 radio observations of  fit into this framework . for that purpose ,",
    "we have plotted in figure 8 the asm hardness ratio and light - curve for the 2000 outburst of .",
    "similarly , after an initial hs ( e.g. rodriguez , corbel , & tomsick 2003 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2004 ) , the source went into the spl state with gradual softening of the x - ray spectrum in between ( very similar to the is of  and  mentioned above ) .",
    "the radio flare was observed again after the softening was over ( corbel et al .",
    "again , the high frequency qpos ( miller et al . 2001 ) were only reported in the spl state ( between mjd 51663 and mjd 51672 ) , i.e after the end of the softening . the second radio observation of  occurred later in the spl state and showed that the radio emission was quenched so that either the observation occurred between two flares or perhaps there was no flare at all .",
    "the x - ray spectral evolution ( rodriguez , corbel , & tomsick 2003 ) may even suggest that the ejected material could be originating from the corona .",
    "the outburst evolution of xte  j1859@xmath1226 ( figure 9 ) could again be included in this picture : after an initial hs and a softening , a massive radio flare occurred ; then , as the source became spectrally harder , several weaker flares took place .      at this stage",
    ", it is not clear if the general pattern presented in the previous subsection only concerns the spl state .",
    "perhaps the is , with slower evolution and a significant level of hard x - ray emission ( like the is in ) , is not associated with radio emission .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to note that before the major radio flare observed in 2002 ( see figure  2 in gallo et al .",
    "2004 ) , a stable level of radio emission with a flux of @xmath3 12 mjy and a flat spectrum ( between 4.8 and 8.6 ghz ) was observed in .",
    "so , as  was in the is at that time , this would indicate that the compact jet could possibly survive during the is but could be destroyed very quickly , i.e. on time - scale of hours .",
    "similarly , a non - zero level of radio emission with a flat spectrum is also observed in xte  j1859@xmath1226 prior to its major radio flare in 1999 ( brocksopp et al . 2002 ) .",
    "again this detection would be consistent with the presence of the compact jet in the is of xte  j1859@xmath1226 .",
    "if this interpretation is correct ( i.e. the compact jet exists in the is ) , this would be an important clue for understanding the inflow - outflow coupling close to the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "for that purpose , it would be very important to monitor the radio properties of bhcs during the is or spl state in order to constrain the geometry of these bhc systems during the various x - ray states . in any case",
    ", this suggestion seems to be confirmed by fender et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who studied similar datasets ( including also , but not ) and drawn similar conclusions regarding the nature of radio emission in the is and spl state .      as a final remark , in figure 6",
    ", we observe that the radio observations in the initial hs and in the spl state occurred at the same unabsorbed x - ray flux , which corresponds to a level of 4 crab ( @xmath3 8% of the eddington luminosity for a 4  black hole at 3 kpc ) , ( if we used an upper limit of 7 , then it would correspond to about 4.6% of the eddington luminosity ) .",
    "this picture is qualitively consistent with the behavior of ,  and ( gallo et al . 2003 ) , indicating that the quenching of the compact jet occurs at an almost fixed fraction ( few percent ) of the eddington luminosity so that there is a correlation between the mass of the black hole and the x - ray flux where the transition occurs .",
    "we note that if the mass of a black hole is known , then a measurement of the x - ray flux for which quenching occurs could constitute an independent distance estimate ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the last radio observations that we discuss in this paper are those ( # 5 and 6 ) that were conducted during the td state .",
    "radio emission is observed ( figures 3 and 10 ) at a level of @xmath3 1 mjy with a spectrum that is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission ( but the spectral index is not well constrained ) .",
    "these detections are contrary to what would have been expected in the td state , which has always ( in previous observations of bhcs ) been associated with quenched radio emission : e.g.  ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ; corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) and  ( gallo et al . 2003 ; tigelaar et al . 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , these detections do not fit with the standard view , and they constitute a certain surprise . as discussed in section 3.2 , the radio flaring emission observed in a soft state of xte  j1859@xmath1226 ( brocksopp et al . 2002 ) has to be related to the behavior of bhc while in the spl state . regarding the case of , the hid ( fig .",
    "2 ) indicates that the detection of radio emission in the td state in not related to spectral hardening at all , as the x - ray emission stays very soft during this period with no hard component .",
    "so , an alternative explanation must be found , and we will concentrate on two possibilities .",
    "first , we consider the possibility that the radio emission is still related to the compact jet . as demonstrated in the case of  ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ; corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) , the td state is associated with a quenching of the compact jet by at least a factor of 25 . according to meier , koide , & uchida ( 2001 )",
    ", the quenching would be the result of a weaker poloidal magnetic field in geometrically thin accretion disk .",
    "migliari et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported the detection of radio emission in two atoll - type neutron star x - ray binaries while they were in a soft ( banana ) x - ray state .",
    "they suggested that this could be related to an interaction of the magnetic field of the neutron star with the accretion disk .",
    "however , such explanation does not work in the case of , which is likely a black hole based on its x - ray properties and also its mass function ( orosz et al .",
    "maybe the mass of the black hole in  ( that may be smaller than typical stellar mass black hole ) is an important parameter that could set the level of quenching when the spectrum gets soft .",
    "however , as the compact jet was quenched by a factor of @xmath5 25 in the spl state ( observation # 4 ) , similar to other bhcs ( e.g.  fender et al .",
    "1999 ) , it seems likely that the observed radio emission in the td state of does not originate from the compact jet .",
    "the second possibility that we consider now is that the observed radio emission is the result of the interaction of material previously ejected from the system with the interstellar medium , similarly to what has been observed for   ( corbel et al .",
    "2002 ; tomsick et al . 2003 ; kaaret et al . 2003 ) and for ( gallo et al .",
    "the observed radio spectrum would be consistent with this interpretation ( optically thin synchrotron emission , but it should be kept in mind that the spectral index is not well constrained ) .",
    "in addition , we also observed that within an observation , the flux is varying ( decaying ) on time - scale of hours .",
    "for example , in observation # 5 , the radio flux density drops ( during the observation ) from 1.74 @xmath4 0.11 mjy to 0.85 @xmath4 0.11 mjy at 4800 mhz and from 1.09 @xmath4 0.11 mjy to 0.80 @xmath4 0.15 mjy at 8640 mhz . there also seems to be some variations for the observation # 6 .",
    "this is contrary to what has been found previously in  with the slow decay of radio emission ( on a time - scale of a week ) due to the jet / ism interaction ( corbel et al .",
    "2002 ; corbel et al . in prep . ) .",
    "however , the variations of radio emission in the large scale jet of  was much faster than in the case of .",
    "the origin of the ejected material could be related to the flaring behavior in the spl state or more likely during the is / spl state transition ( as discussed in section 3.2 ) , similarly to .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the contribution to the x - ray spectrum of the interaction of the jet with the ism ( as in in ) would not be detectable , as the x - ray spectrum would likely be dominated by the thermal emission from the accretion disk . in any case , this may suggest that the reactivation of particle acceleration during collisions with the interstellar medium may be a common occurrence in microquasars .",
    "was discovered in september 2001 and then underwent transitions between various x - ray spectral states while we observed the source at radio frequencies .",
    "we can summarize our conclusions as follows . in the hard state ,",
    "the radio emission of  can be interpreted ( like other bhcs ) as arising from a self - absorbed compact jet .",
    "however , there seems to be some indication that the radio spectrum is less inverted than in other sources .",
    "in addition ,  seems to be more x - ray loud when compared to other black hole candidates observed at similar radio flux density .",
    "this could possibly indicate that  is dominated in the x - ray regime by comptonization of the disk photons in the corona with negligible ( if any ) contribution from the compact jet at high energies ( x - ray , optical , and possibly even in the infrared ) . with the observations performed in the steep power - law state and using the existing data from other bhcs , we conclude that the transition from is to spl state is likely associated with a ( more or less ) massive ejection event that decays on a time - scale of hours .",
    "in addition , weaker radio flares ( and hence ejection events ) may be observed in the spl state associated with x - ray spectral hardening .",
    "if a radio observation took place between two flares or if no flare occurred at all , then no radio emission would be detected .",
    "for the is itself , the detection of radio emission ( with a flat spectrum ) prior to the major flare of xte  j1859@xmath1226 in 1999 and  in 2002 ( associated to an is / spl state transition ) may suggest that the compact jet can survive in the is , and perhaps this is due to the fact that the flux of soft x - rays is lower in the is than in the spl state . in the td state , we have surprisingly detected a significant amount of varying radio emission that we interpret as the interaction of previously ejected materials with the neighboring environment ( ism or remnant of past activity ) , similar to what has been observed in . in that case , such events may be more common than previously thought .",
    "our conclusions regarding the nature of radio emission along the various spectral states of  and a possible extension to black hole candidates in general are summarized in table 2 ) .",
    "all of this points to the fact that it is extremely important to intensively monitor the radio properties of bhcs along the various x - ray states in order to shed light on the accretion - ejection coupling close to the black hole event horizon .",
