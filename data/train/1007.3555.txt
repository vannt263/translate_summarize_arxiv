    "photonic materials with complete photonic band gaps ( pbgs ) , i.e. , frequency ranges over which electromagnetic wave propagation is prohibited for all directions and polarizations , are artificial dielectric heterostructures that enable control of the generation and flow of light .",
    "their development @xcite has evolved dramatically in the last decade and their unusual properties have found a wide range of applications including efficient radiation sources,@xcite telecommunications devices , @xcite sensors @xcite and optical computer chips.@xcite until recently , the only known materials with complete pbgs were photonic crystals comprised of a periodic arrangements of dielectric materials . in photonic crystals ,",
    "the opening of the pbg is understood to be governed by the synergetic interplay between bragg scattering resonances of the periodic dielectric array and the mie resonances of individual dielectric scattering centers.@xcite     maps the vertices of a rhombus tiling ( red / grey points ) into a network of cells whose vertices are trivalent ( black segments and points ) . to construct a photonic material with a complete band gap ,",
    "edges are replaced by a wall of dielectric of finite thickness and the vertices are replaced by cylinders of finite radius . ]",
    "a similar combination of scattering mechanisms is possible in photonic quasicrystals , in which the dielectric materials are arranged in a pattern with long - range quasiperiodic translational order and rotational symmetries forbidden to crystals ( such as 5-fold symmetry in two dimensions and icosahedral symmetry in three dimensions).@xcite quasiperiodic order also produces bragg scattering @xcite .",
    "in fact , there have been numerous studies of photonic quasicrystals with pbgs in the literature.@xcite their band gaps are found to be considerably more isotropic and , for two - dimensional quasicrystals , the dielectric contrast required to open the band gaps for tm polarization ( electric field oscillating out of the plane ) is smaller than the contrast required for the periodic counterparts.@xcite most of the photonic quasicrystalline structures considered only have band gaps for either tm or te polarized radiation.@xcite two examples of complete band gaps have been found previously;@xcite here we present a systematic method to produce substantially greater fundamental complete band gaps for photonic quasicrystals with arbitrary symmetry .    in general , the architectures required for optimal tm band gaps are quite different than optimal architectures for te polarization ( electric field oscillating in the plane ) .",
    "structures based on a distribution of isolated dielectric inclusions ( _ e.g. _ , rods ) is best for tm band baps , while structures based on connected dielectric networks are optimal for te.@xcite for the case of quasicrystalline systems , with their rich variety of local environments , the problem of finding an optimal compromise becomes more difficult .",
    "consequently , until now , there has not been a systematic procedure for designing quasiperiodic photonic structures with sizable pbgs for all directions of propagation and polarizations .        in this paper",
    ", we introduce a novel optimization scheme discussed in ref .",
    "( where it was applied to disordered heterostructures ) to design two - dimensional photonic quasicrystals with substantial complete pbgs , comparable to the largest band gaps found for photonic crystals . the examples illustrated here are based on the vertices of a penrose tiling,@xcite a 5-fold symmetric pattern composed of obtuse and acute rhombi and on the vertices of an octagonal tiling , @xcite an 8-fold symmetric pattern composed of squares and rhombi .    in section  [ secii ] , we describe how the quasiperiodic patterns are constructed . in section  [ seciii ] , we present the results of the band structure calculations and analyze the properties of the resulting pbgs including the field distribution of the photonic modes that define the photonic band edges .",
    "section  [ seciv ] provides concluding remarks .",
    "the penrose and octagonal quasicrystalline point patterns considered in this work are constructed by the projection and cut method,@xcite which consists of projecting the points of an @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice into the three dimensional space , where @xmath1 for the octagonal lattice and @xmath2 for the penrose lattice . in general , the lack of spatial periodicity makes it impossible to define a unit cell for band gap calculations ; we address this by using a series of rational periodic approximants of the quasicrystal . in the case of the penrose lattice periodic approximants",
    "are constructed by the same projection method by replacing by a fibonacci ratio ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the unit cell is rectangularly shaped and its area grows as n increases and the rational approximant approaches @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , for a rational approximant @xmath5 , the unit cell has dimensions @xmath6 and contains @xmath7 vertices of the rhombic pattern . in the case of the octagonal quasilattices , we replace by its continuous fraction series ( @xmath8 ) , and",
    "the resulting periodic approximant has a square shaped unit cell of side @xmath9 containing @xmath10 vertices of the square - rhombic pattern .",
    "the periodic approximants constructed this way results in tilings consisting of identical tiles as the original quasiperiodic tiling and transition from quasiperiodicity to periodicity is accommodated through the flipping of a certain number of tiles .",
    "these rational periodic approximants are known to be the best approximants of the quasiperiodic lattice as they achieve the selected periodicity by introducing the minimum density of defects with respect to the perfect quasiperiodic tiling.@xcite the vertices of the tilings obtained by this method form a sequence of quasicrystal approximant point pattern .",
    "the next step is to find the arrangement of dielectric material around the point pattern that produces the optimal tm , te and complete pbgs .",
    "identifying these optimal dielectric distributions is well known to be a daunting computational task , despite the recent development of rigorous mathematical optimization methods.@xcite    for the case of tm radiation only , a nearly optimal decoration for a given point pattern is obtained by placing identical dielectric cylinders centered at each point and adjusting the radius . for the optimal radius ,",
    "there is a coincidence of mie and bragg scattering effects that lead to substantial band gaps.@xcite the dielectric cylinders support mie scattering resonances and , for frequencies above the lowest order resonance , the scattered radiation is out of phase with the incident wave .",
    "this destructive interference prohibits radiation propagation and favors the opening of a complete tm gap.@xcite at the same time , the quasiperiodic long range order in quasicrystalline systems results in a dense ( no minimum separation ) collection of bragg peaks ; however , it is notable that most of bragg peak intensities are infinitesimally small .",
    "the first set of intense bragg peaks is associated with scattering on planes separated by the average distance in the quasicrystalline point pattern and can be employed to define an effective brillouin zone .",
    "therefore , as for photonic crystals , bragg scattering also contributes to the pbg formation in photonic quasicrystals such that , whenever the wavevector of the incident radiation is directed along the effective brillouin zone boundary , the reflected and refracted waves interfere to cancel the incoming wave and prevent its propagation inside the structure .",
    "an optimal band gap occurs when the two scattering mechanism reinforce each other on a given spectral range .",
    "this approach can be applied to find near optimal tm band gap for the 5- and 8-fold quasicrystal patterns obtained by projection.@xcite    to obtain the optimal pbgs for te radiation , where the electric field is oriented in the plane of the scatters , necessitates a different dielectric arrangement . instead of isolated cylinders , a connected network of dielectric with air pockets in between is favored .",
    "for example , a commonly used configuration for photonic crystals is inverted  compared to the optimal structures for tm pbgs , i.e. , placing an identical air cylinder at each point so as to produce a connected network of dielectric material .",
    "however , in the case of quasicrystalline structures , we find this method fails to produce sizable fundamental te pbgs .",
    "the main reason is that the inverted structure has a very non - uniform distribution of dielectric scattering regions that broadens the distribution of resonances .",
    "similarly , placing walls along the edges of each penrose tile as in ref .",
    "has rather non - uniform connectivity and fails to produce an optimal te pbg .    to overcome this problem",
    ", we employ a protocol introduced in ref .   that converts a general point pattern into photonic heterostructures with sizeable , nearly optimal te pbgs .",
    "we briefly review the protocol here : consider an arbitrary point pattern denoted by red disks in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the example in the figure ,",
    "the point pattern is enclosed in a square domain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "first , we perform a delaunay tessellation of the original point pattern .",
    "this provides a triangular partitioning that minimizes the standard deviation of the triangle angles around the mean of @xmath11 .",
    "next , associated with each triangle is a centroidal point ; these are connected with line segments to form cells around the original points .",
    "the nearly optimal heterostructure for te band gaps is obtained by decorating the edges of the cell network with walls ( along the azimuthal direction ) of dielectric material of uniform width @xmath12 , as displayed in fig .",
    "we note that this procedure is universal and can be used to generate connected network architectures based on periodic , quasiperiodic and disordered point patterns .",
    "finally , the optimal structure is obtained by varying a single parameter , the cell thickness , and identifying the value that maximizes the te band gap .",
    "the total number of cells in the network is the same as the number of points in the original point pattern and each vertex of the network is trivalent .",
    "the cells can be regarded as individual scattering objects supporting electromagnetic resonances , which become coupled to each other when placed into the connected network .    with an additional step ,",
    "the protocol can be used to a heterostructure with a nearly optimal _ complete _ pbg , i.e. , maximal overlap between tm and te gaps .",
    "namely , each vertex of the trihedral network constructed above is decorated with a cylinder or radius @xmath13 .",

    "the results here are consistent with our conjecture in that the width of the optimal complete band gaps for the photonic quasicrystals lies between the optima found for crystals and disordered heterostructures .",

    "radiation with frequencies above or below the band edges are propagating modes that are transmitted through photonic crystals but are more localized modes in the case of quasiperiodic patterns , which give the former advantages in some applications , such as light sources.@xcite on the other hand , due to the lack of translational symmetry , pbg structures constructed around quasiperiodic point patterns can provide a large number of inequivalent local environments and as such can support a rich variety of localized modes .",

    "the circular window scans the quasicrystalline domain and the variance of the number of points in the window is evaluated ( the windows employed in our calculations contain from a few to 5000 points and to calculate the variance we use 1000 configurations with a fixed window size ) .",
