    "phase separation in driven diffusive systems  @xcite or jamming in traffic flows  @xcite is also an example of the condensation .",
    "the condensation has been studied within the framework of a zero range process  ( zrp ) introduced by spitzer  @xcite .",
    "those studies revealed that the condensation can be caused by effective attractions between particles or quenched disorder  @xcite . in the former",
    "the condensation is a spontaneous symmetry breaking transition . in the latter it is similar to the bose - einstein condensation occurring in the ideal bose gas  @xcite .",
    "the condensation has been studied mostly on periodic lattices . on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies show that lattices  ( networks in general ) , upon which physical systems are defined , may have more complex structure  @xcite .",
    "particularly many real - world networks are found to be _ scale - free_. that is to say , they are characterized with the power - law degree distribution @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fraction of nodes  ( or sites ) with the degree @xmath5  ( the degree of a node denotes the number of neighbors connected to it ) and @xmath6 is called the degree distribution exponent .",
    "this is contrasted to a peaked distribution for periodic regular lattices .",
    "the power - law distribution implies that the sf networks have an inhomogeneous structure .",
    "the structural inhomogeneity is an important factor in understanding dynamical processes in sf networks  @xcite . in random walks , for instance ,",
    "a diffusing particle visits highly connected nodes more often than others .",
    "moreover diffusion processes are asymmetric .",
    "it means that the speed of random walks from a node to another is not equal to that in the reversed direction in general .",
    "the asymmetry can be quantified with the so - called random walk centrality  @xcite , which is defined on each node and proportional to its degree .",
    "this example shows that each node plays a different role in stochastic processes in inhomogeneous networks .",
    "it also suggests that interactions in many particle systems would be important since particle density could be high at some nodes .    in this paper",

    "the relaxation dynamics has a _ hierarchical _ nature ; starting from small degree nodes , the relaxation proceeds to larger and larger degree nodes . the relaxation time @xmath7 follows a power - law scaling @xmath0 with the dynamic exponent @xmath2 and the network size @xmath1 in the condensed phase .",
    "the relaxation dynamics depends on the global structure of underlying networks so that the dynamic exponent takes a different value depending on whether the networks have a tree structure or not .",

    "recently , generalizations with multi - species particles  @xcite or with multiple - particle hoppings  @xcite are being considered .",
    "a particle interaction can be incorporated into the jumping rate .",
    "if particles are noninteracting , they move independently , hence @xmath19 . an attractive interaction can be imposed with the jumping rate function @xmath20 that grows sub - linearly or decreases with @xmath21 , or a repulsive interaction with a super - linear jumping rate function . in the context of data packet transport",

    "the condensation also occurs in a system without quenched disorder .",
    "for instance , consider a zrp on periodic regular lattices with the jumping rate @xmath43 .",
    "a straightforward analysis shows that the system is in the condensed phase when @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xcite . in this case , a macroscopic condensate forms at a node selected spontaneously .    as for the relaxation dynamics ,",

    "we consider the relaxation dynamic of the above example with the jumping rate @xmath46 in the condensed phase .",
    "being distributed uniformly initially , particles form small clusters at nodes due to a stochastic fluctuation .",
    "it is believed that a macroscopic condensate emerges by successive coarsening processes of the small clusters .",

    "on the other hand , consider a zrp in _ periodic lattices _ with _ disordered _ jumping rates @xmath69 and with nearest neighbor particle hoppings .",
    "it is evident that the two models share the same stationary state .",

    "it is noteworthy that the mean occupation number in the stationary state is solely determined by the degree , which is a local quantity , and independent of any other characteristics of a network .",
