    "the togliatti surface in @xmath6 is the rational surface parametrized by the cubic monomials in three variables @xmath7 .",

    "this twofold example has lead the authors of this note , together with g. ottaviani , to establish the connection between the geometric notion of variety satisfying laplace equations and the algebraic notion of artinian ideal failing the weak lefschetz property , thanks to the notion of togliatti system , introduced in @xcite , see definition [ togliattisystem ] .",
    "togliatti systems of cubics have been completely described in @xcite and @xcite . for degree @xmath11 ,",
    "the picture quickly becomes much more complicated and only partial results are known so far , see for instance @xcite containing a characterization of togliatti systems with low  number of generators .",
    "an interesting property of the ideal @xmath8 is that the associated morphism @xmath12 is a cyclic galois cover of degree @xmath13 of the image surface , such that for a general line @xmath14 the inverse image of @xmath15 is a union of three lines in general position .",
    "this observation has been exploited to give a new beautiful proof of the theorem of togliatti ( see @xcite , theorem 2.2.1 ) .    in this article",
    "we start from this observation to construct a new class of examples of togliatti systems in three variables of any degree @xmath1 , and by consequence of rational surfaces parametrized by polynomials of degree @xmath1 satisfying a laplace equation of order @xmath16 .",
    "we call them gt - systems in honour to galois and togliatti . precisely , we consider the galois cyclic covers with domain @xmath17 , with cyclic group @xmath2 , for any @xmath3 and any representation of @xmath2 on @xmath18 .",
    "we prove in theorem [ upper ] that they are all defined by monomial togliatti systems of degree @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the ideal generated by the invariant homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath1 for any action of this type is a monomial togliatti system .",

    "in particular this is always the case when @xmath1 is prime or a power of a prime .",

    "we also describe for any degree @xmath1 the geometry of the toric surface @xmath24 , image of the morphism defined by the monomials invariant for the action of @xmath25 .",

    "in particular , we recall the definition of smooth monomial minimal togliatti system and we introduce new families of togliatti systems , the so - called gt - systems , which will be our objects of study . in section [ galois ] , we establish the basic properties of a gt - system @xmath26 generated by all forms of degree @xmath1 invariants under the action of the matrix @xmath27 , where @xmath5 denotes a primitive @xmath1-th root of the unity and @xmath28 .",
    "namely , @xmath26 is generated by monomials , its minimal number of generators is bounded by @xmath29 , it fails wlp from degree @xmath16 to degree @xmath1 and it defines a galois cover @xmath30 with cyclic galois group @xmath2 .",
    "section [ minimality ] is entirely devoted to study the minimality of gt - systems . as a main tool we use circulant matrices . in section [ d prime ] ,",
    "we completely classify gt - systems in the case @xmath1 prime or a power of a prime , while in section [ general ] we give the complete classification for all @xmath1 of the actions represented by matrices of the form @xmath31 in section [ geomproperties ] , we study from a geometric point of view the rational surfaces @xmath24 associated to generalized classical gt - systems .",
    "we prove that the homogeneous ideal @xmath32 is a cohen - macaulay ideal generated by quadrics and cubics if @xmath1 is odd and only by quadrics if @xmath1 is even .",
    "finally , we describe the singular locus of @xmath24 : the 3 fundamental points of @xmath33 are sent to the singular points of @xmath24 which are cyclic quotient singularities .",
    "finally , in section [ config ] , we establish the link between gt - systems and ceva linear configurations @xmath34 ; and we study the freeness of the arrangement @xmath35 of lines associated to @xmath34 .    _ acknowledgement . _",
