    "<S> the vdw interaction between the sodium atoms and ig causes a phase shift of about @xmath1 radians . </S>",
    "<S> a number of systematic effects need to be understood before reporting this phase shift induced by the vdw interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes how the measured phase shift and contrast in @xcite are influenced by these systematic effects and suggests some physical mechanisms for them .    </S>",
    "<S> in general there is a non - trivial relationship between the measured phase shift @xmath2 and induced phase shift @xmath0 , when the ifm paths are partially obscured by a phase shifting element . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . in reality </S>",
    "<S> there are more than just two paths that can interfere because of the other diffraction orders . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multifm ] . </S>",
    "<S> these additional interfering paths allow for the possibility of the ig to obscure both of the primary interferometer paths , while only obscuring one of the secondary interferometer paths . when this notion is combined with the finite size of the detector and diffraction caused by the third grating @xmath3 , a clear mechanism for the extra phase features is found .    a likely explanation for the unexpected reduction in contrast , when both interferometer paths are obscured by the ig , is shown in fig . [ fig : masking ] . </S>",
    "<S> the inset sem image in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : masking ] shows how the diffraction bars ( which cause the atom - surface phase shift ) are stabilized by much more widely spaced support bars . </S>",
    "<S> the support bars will imprint a spatial amplitude modulation on the two beams , shifted in space by different amounts with respect to the center of the beams . </S>",
    "<S> when the beams are recombined the region of overlap is effectively reduced , leading to an overall reduction in contrast . while there are some near - field diffractive effects caused by the support bars @xcite , numerical simulations have shown that the effective mask picture in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : masking ] is still appropriate when considering the influence on @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that this effect only reduces the contrast for an ifm that has _ both _ paths obscured by the ig . </S>",
    "<S> this also explains the relative prominence of the extra phase features , since the contrast of the primary interferometer is reduced compared to the secondary one as a result of this effect .    when the previously discussed systematic effects are incorporated into the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : signalhalf ] , much better agreement with the data is achieved . the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profdata ] shows the prediction of a model which includes the influence of other interfering orders and the support bars . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite satisfying to see that the behavior of the measured contrast and phase is now understood even when the ig is blocking both of the primary interferometer paths . </S>",
    "<S> one can also see that the asymmetry of the phase profile is reproduced .    in conclusion the measured phase and contrast as a function of ig position </S>",
    "<S> are now understood to be influenced by a number of systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> the primary physical mechanisms for the systematic effects are beam overlap , interference of additional diffraction orders , and an effective masking by the ig support bars . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of systematic effects leads to a relationship between the phase shift that is measured ( @xmath2 ) with our experiment and that which is actually induced ( @xmath0 ) by the ig . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to make quantitative comparisons to predictions for the phase shift @xmath0 and in turn the vdw coefficient @xmath22 @xcite .    </S>",
