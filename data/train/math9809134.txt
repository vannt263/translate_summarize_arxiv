    "the axioms above then correspond to the standard ones for grbner basis theory term orders ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another incarnation of boolean term orders is as antisymmetric comparative probability relations .",
    "the basic idea there is that we have a finite set @xmath15 of events , and are interested in which events are more probable than others , as opposed to the exact probability of each event .",

    "an overview of the theory of comparative probability can be be found in @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is that boolean term orders correspond to one - element extensions of the oriented matroid @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the root system @xmath8 .",
    "this establishes boolean term orders in the frame work of the baues problem , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "section 2 contains precise definitions of term orders , including a notion of coherence .",
    "the connection to the baues problem is strengthened in section 3 with the introduction of a notion of a flip relation between different boolean term orders .",

    "section 4 examines the structure of the set of coherent term orders , and part of the connection to @xmath7 .",
