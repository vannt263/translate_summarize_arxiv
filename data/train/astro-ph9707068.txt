    "in paper i of this series ( rutledge et al . 1997 ) , we presented new observations of the  triplet lines at , , and  in the spectra of 976 stars lying near the red giant branches ( rgbs ) of 52 galactic globular clusters .",
    "the aim of this work is to establish a relative ranking of the clusters according to their calcium abundances , and to apply this ranking to some of the astrophysical problems associated with understanding the early stages of galactic formation .    in  [ indicator ]",
    ", we summarize how the  triplet is used to produce a calcium index , , for a given cluster , and how this index is related to the metallicity , , of the cluster .",
    "a catalog of  values for 71 clusters is created in  [ comp ] from a compilation of data from paper i and from other studies .",
    "zinn and west ( 1984 , zw84 ) produced a relative ranking of the globular clusters using a compilation of almost all the ranking techniques available at that time , to which we make detailed comparisons in  [ relative ] .",
    "considering the past debate over the effect of hb morphology on zinn s ( 1980b ) photometric  index ( smith 1984 , frogel et al .",
    "1983 , zw84 ) , which plays a significant role in the @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] scale , we have re - investigated this issue in  [ q39 ] using our precise  index and more recent hb types from lee et al .",
    "we then make a detailed comparison of our calcium ranking with the  ranking of zw84 , which prove to be highly correlated , but in a _",
    "significantly non - linear way . by combining the information in both systems ,",
    "we are able to provide a metallicity ranking of improved precision (  [ zw84 ] ) . in  [ absolute ] , we compare our calcium ranking to  values from high dispersion spectroscopy studies .",
    "we transform our calcium index to  on the carretta and gratton ( 1997 , cg97 ) scale , which is highly correlated with our  index in an _ essentially linear  fashion . finally , in ",
    "[ discuss ] , we briefly discuss the significance of these disparate metallicity scales and the use of the  triplet lines as a metallicity indicator when studying galactic formation physics . _ _",
    "the  triplet lines at , , and  are used to probe various astrophysical phenomena because they are among the strongest features in the near infrared spectra of most late - type stars and stellar systems , and thus their equivalent widths can be measured reasonably accurately for faint objects with moderate resolution spectrographs .",
    "most of the early integrated light work took advantage of the sensitivity in the triplet s summed equivalent width ( denoted as ) to  as a means to discriminate between dwarf and giant populations ( spinrad and taylor 1969 , 1971 , anderson 1974 ) .",
    "initially , it was thought that  was relatively insensitive to metallicity ( cohen 1978 , 1979 , jones et al .",
    "1984 ) , but alloin and bica s ( 1989 ) re - analysis of jones et al.s data found that metallicity does have a significant effect on .",

    "they suggested that  only plays a significant role when @xmath1}}\\ \\lesssim -0.3 $ ]  dex ; otherwise ,  is the dominant factor .",
    "the sensitivity of  to  was not fully appreciated until it was measured for galactic globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals .    inspired by the success of the   k line to rank globular clusters according to  ( zw84 ) , armandroff and zinn ( 1988 , az88 ) measured  in the integrated light of 27 globular clusters and found very good correlations with other metallicity - sensitive indices . since there is an intrinsic ambiguity in integrated light studies from the uncertainty in determining the fraction of light emitted by the various populations of stars , subsequent studies measured  in individual rgb stars ( da costa and seitzer 1989 , olszewski et al .",
    "1991 , suntzeff et al .",
    "1992 ) . a method of ranking globular clusters by which is independent of both distance and reddening was devised by armandroff and da costa ( 1991 , hereafter ad91 ) , and adopted by almost all later practitioners ( armandroff et al .",
    "1992 [ adz92 ] , da costa et al .",
    "1992 [ dan92 ] , suntzeff et al .",
    "1993 [ s93 ] , geisler et al .",
    "1995 [ g95 ] , da costa and armandroff 1995 [ da95 ] , suntzeff and kraft 1996 [ sk96 ] , paper i ) .",
    "ad91 fully describe the technique , but we summarize the salient features .",
    "the  is measured in probable member rgb stars as a function of the v magnitude above the horizontal branch ( hb ) . due to a combination of both  and",
    "decreasing as  increases ,  increases going up the rgb with a slope of @xmath2  mag@xmath3 ( paper i ) .",
    "it has been shown empirically that this slope is independent of the cluster metallicity ( ad91 , da95 , paper i ) , and thus the  of a red giant star in any cluster can be adjusted to the level of the hb by applying the correction @xmath4 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath5 for all rgb stars measured in the cluster is then denoted as the reduced equivalent width , , which is taken to be a calcium index for the entire cluster . for the 52 globular clusters we studied ( paper i ) , the  values ranged from 1.58    for ngc  4590 ( @xmath1}}_{zw84 } = -2.09 $ ] ) to 5.41    for ngc  6528 ( @xmath1}}_{zw84 } = + 0.12 $ ] ) . with a typical @xmath6 of @xmath7 ,",
    "this provides approximately 48 resolution elements ( each of @xmath8 dex ) with which to rank the globular clusters in @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] .",
    "a large number of  measurements for globular cluster rgb stars are now found in the literature .",
    "we have transformed these to our paper i system in two ways : the first involves transforming  values , while the second involves transforming  values and then calculating  from them . as a result , 44 cluster  values were transformed onto the paper i system , 25 of which were in the paper i sample .",
    "this increases the paper i sample size from 52 to 71 clusters .",
    "the transformed  values from the various authors , along with our final adopted  value for each cluster , are presented in table  [ redew ] , where the columns are , respectively , 1 ) the consecutive cluster number ; 2 - 4 ) the ngc , other cluster , and iau names ; 5 ) the  values from paper i ; 6 ) the da95  values transformed to the paper i system , as described by the first method below ; 7 ) other  values transformed to the paper i system , as described by the second method below ; 8) the final adopted  value calculated as described below ; and 9 ) the reference from which the  values were taken to calculate the  given in column 7 .",
    "the number following the @xmath9 sign in columns five through eight represent our one sigma error estimates on these values .",
    "da95 transformed the  values of ad91 , dan92 , adz92 , and s93 onto their system to calculate  values for their calibrating globular clusters . using 13 globular clusters that we observed in common with da95",
    ", we obtain the linear regression ( see figure  [ transform.grp ] ) , @xmath10 using an algorithm which allows for errors in both directions ( stetson 1989 ) .",
    "as described in paper i , the  value is a @xmath11 variable which measures the scatter about the fit , where a value of one indicates that the scatter is consistent with the observational errors , and larger values indicate that either the errors have been underestimated or the relation is non - linear .",
    "the above regression was used to transform 24  values from da95 onto our paper i system ( see table  [ redew ] ) , where the errors tabulated include transformation errors .",
    "we did not use ngc  5927 to determine the regression due to the problems discussed by da95 larger .",
    "they used the five larger values to define  for ngc  5927 , and proposed that the bifurcation is most likely a result of rather large errors in the photometry they used ( menzies 1974 ) and/or differential reddening across the cluster , as suggested by menzies and more recently by cohen and sleeper ( 1995 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the stars in our paper i sample were not observed in the new ccd photometry of ngc  5927 ( sarajedini and norris 1994 ) , so we could not test da95 s hypothesis .",
    "since the scatter of the 11 stars about our fit to this cluster is consistent with our observational errors , it seems that differential reddening among our stars was not appreciable .",
    "( the stars from da95 and paper i were both selected to avoid the region defined by menzies ( 1974 ) to be differentially reddened . ) our final  value for this cluster is simply the weighted mean of the transformed da95 value and the paper i value . ] .",
    "for the remainder of the clusters in ad91 , adz92 , dan92 and s93 that da95 did not use as calibrating clusters , and for the clusters observed by g95 and sk96 , the following transformation technique was used .",
    "the individual  values were transformed onto the paper i system using the regressions given in table  6 of paper i , where the errors attached to each value include the errors incurred from the transformation .",
    "the  of each cluster was then calculated as the weighted mean of @xmath12 for each star in the cluster , where the weights were assigned as @xmath13 .",
    "the errors for these  values , listed in column 7 of table  [ redew ] , were calculated as @xmath14 if the  value was @xmath15 , and as @xmath16 if  was @xmath17 , where the sum is taken over the number of stars observed in the cluster . in total , 21 cluster  values were transformed onto the paper i system using this technique .    the adopted  value for each cluster was calculated as a weighted mean of the individual  values listed in table  [ redew ] , where the weights were assigned as @xmath13 .",
    "the errors were calculated as ( @xmath18 if the  value was @xmath15 , and as @xmath16 if  was @xmath17 , where the sum is taken over the available  values discussed above . in order to calculate the  index ,",
    "it is necessary to measure the v magnitude of the hb , which introduces another source of error in .",
    "we have allowed for an uncertainty of @xmath19  mag in , by adding in quadrature an additional error of @xmath20 to the error estimate described above .",
    "this final error estimate is given in column 8 of table  [ redew ] .",
    "the relative metallicities of globular clusters can be estimated by a variety of techniques ( kraft 1979 ) , most of which measure either line blocking in the cluster integrated light , or some metallicity sensitive parameter in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , while some of the more recent techniques employ equivalent width measurements of strong spectral features .",
    "the zw84  scale is a relative ranking of 121 galactic globular clusters placed on cohen s ( see frogel et al .",
    "1983 for a compilation and references ) metallicity scale with a precision of @xmath210.1 dex .",
    "zw84 combined a variety of relative ranking indices to increase their sample size and average over various observational uncertainties . since the zw84 scale has been widely applied and contains the information present in most relative ranking indices available at the time of its compilation , we first focus our attention on it .",
    "seventy - nine globular clusters were ranked with the photometric   index ( zinn 1980b ) , which is a filter system applied to integrated light to measure line blocking over @xmath21190   centered on the  h and k lines .",
    "integrated light spectrograms of 60 clusters were subsequently used to measure the pseudo - equivalent widths of the  k , the g band , and the @xmath22 lines ( zw84 ) .",
    "these rankings were transformed to  values , which increased the number of clusters with observed or inferred  indices to 74 .",
    "the weighted mean of  was taken by zw84 to determine the spectroscopically augmented  values for clusters with more than one estimate .",
    "except where specifically noted , we adopt the spectroscopically augmented  values of zw84 for use throughout this paper ; were the photometric  values used in the final analysis , our results would not change significantly . due to higher  values , blue hb stars produce great flux at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "therefore , clusters with extremely blue hbs are expected to have their  values diluted by this flux , and thus their  values underestimated . for the photometric  index , manduca ( 1983 )",
    "provides theoretical support for this effect , while smith ( 1984 ) and frogel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) provide observational evidence .",
    "however , zw84 provide counter arguments which suggest that their spectroscopically augmented   is only weakly dependent on hb morphology , if at all .    in figure  [ q39.grp ]",
    ", we plot each of these four  indices against , where symbols represent different ranges in  ( lee et al .",

    "all four indices correlate well but non - linearly with ; indeed , all suggest a break at @xmath213.5 - 4.0 . in the present sample",
    ", the second - parameter problem appears in its full - blown form over a surprisingly narrow range of calcium - triplet strength : the calcium - weakest cluster with a predominantly red hb [ @xmath23 is ngc  362 , with @xmath24 , while the calcium - strongest cluster with a predominantly blue hb [ @xmath25 is ngc  6266 , with @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath28  @xmath28 1.1 .",
    "therefore , the possibility exists that previous estimates of the _ extent _ of the second - parameter problem may have been inflated slightly by the inclusion of clusters with metallicities as uncertain as @xmath90.2 or @xmath90.3  dex .",
    "only the accumulation of a considerably larger sample of highly precise metallicity indicators will delimit the true abundance range of the second parameter effect .",
    "however , within the restricted range 1.40 @xmath28 @xmath1}}_{zw84 } \\ltsim$ ] 1.25 it is certainly true that the second parameter problem is real , as clusters of all five hb classes are found there : our `` very blue '' , `` blueish , '' `` reddish , '' and `` very red '' classes , as well as the prototype of the `` bimodal hb '' class , ngc  2808 . within the narrow range 3.72  @xmath29 4.01   ,",
    "it is evident from the bottom right panel of figure  [ q39.grp ] that ( within the small - number statistics of the present sample ) clusters with red hbs ( closed symbols ) tend to have larger values of the photometric  index than those with blue hbs ( open symbols ) of comparable  values .",
    "furthermore , if we extend the range under consideration to 3.3  @xmath30 4.3   , it appears that clusters with blueish hbs ( open diamonds ) tend to lie above those with very blue hbs ( open triangles ) and clusters with very red hbs ( closed circles ) tend to lie above those with reddish hbs ( closed squares ) .",

    "given the present sample size , this result is hardly definitive , but it does provide ( weak ) support to the contention of manduca ( 1983 ) , smith ( 1984 ) , and frogel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , that the photometric  index is affected by differences in hb morphology at fixed metal abundance . however , little or no corresponding trend of ca ii k - line strength , mg i b strength , or g - band strength with hb morphology is seen ( the other three panels of figure  [ q39.grp ] ) . a more detailed discussion of the implications of these observations is given in the next section .      the relative ranking of the majority of the globular clusters in zw84 has been determined either from 1 ) the  index , @xmath1}}_{q_{39}}$ ] , or , 2 ) the weighted mean of eight other independent ranking indices , @xmath1}}_{avg}$ ] , or 3 ) the average of the two .",

    "the debate over the metal - rich end of the metallicity scale in the early 1980 s is well known ( see , e.g. , freeman and norris 1981 ) , where photographic hds with echelle spectrographs ( pilachowski et al . 1980 ,",

    "we feel rather sobered by issues surrounding the metallicity scale and the widespread use of the  triplet as a surrogate for overall metal abundance , as we briefly discuss here .      as shown above ,",

    "disturbingly , however , a significantly non - linear correlation with @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] contrasts sharply with the linear correlation we find with @xmath1}}_{cg97}$ ] .",
    "we have no particular _ a priori reason to expect how , an empirical line - strength measure , should be related to , and it is unclear which , if either ,  scale to trust . _    the sense of the non - linear relation between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] is that the abundance sensitivity of  decreases as the abundance on the @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] scale increases ( ad91 , dan92 , s93 , da95 , sk96 ) .",
    "most of the preceding authors chose to transform their  values into @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] via two linear relations with a break at @xmath1}}_{zw84 } \\sim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "three potential reasons for the decrease in abundance sensitivity of  with increasing abundance were outlined by ad91 , but to our knowledge this issue has not been significantly explored since .",
    "ad91 proposed that : i ) weak metal lines and molecular bands of tio may be depressing the pseudo - continuum in the more metal - rich clusters , thereby resulting in smaller measured  values ; ii ) at higher abundances , the increase in the strength of the  lines occurs mostly in the wings , where it is harder to measure than in the line cores ; and finally , iii )  actually does decrease with increasing .",
    "there are at least two other effects that should be considered when trying to understand this nonlinearity .",
    "firstly , as noted by az88 , increases with  both because the abundance of ca in the atmosphere is larger , and because  at the level of the hb is smaller .",
    "furthermore , an increase in cluster  causes  at the level of the hb to be smaller . despite the earlier studies , jorgensen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have shown through synthetic spectra calculations that  has a relatively large and complex dependence on  in the globular cluster metallicity range .",
    "it is clear that  is sensitive to more than just a simple abundance increase in globular clusters as their rgbs shift in the ,   plane .",
    "secondly ,  may appear to lose sensitivity to  for the higher metallicity clusters because all comparisons , so far , have been made between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] , which may itself be non - linear with respect to the true  ( cg97 and below ) .",
    "the relative indices used by zw84 were placed on the  scale compiled by frogel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) . for @xmath1}}\\leq -1.5",
    "$ ] , the scale is based on the early high - dispersion photographic spectroscopy of individual giant stars by cohen ( 1978b , 1979b , 1981 ) and cohen and frogel ( 1982 ) , while for the more metal - rich clusters , it is based on models of line blocking in low - dispersion scans of individual stars ( cohen 1982 , 1983 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the `` break '' in linearity between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] also occurs at @xmath1}}_{zw84 } \\sim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "in addition , if only clusters with @xmath1}}_{zw84 } \\lesssim -1.5 $ ] are used to compare @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] and @xmath1}}_{cg97}$ ] , there is very little evidence for a non - linear relationship between them .    in summary , possible reasons for the non - linear relationship between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] can be split into three classes : i ) it is a result of how  and  ( and possibly turbulent velocity ) of the rgb stars vary for clusters of different and , thus , how the line formation physics behaves for those variables ; ii ) it is a result of galactic formation physics , where the more metal - poor clusters were enriched by different mechanisms than were the metal - rich clusters , thereby producing different  ratios as a function of  ( see below ) ; or , iii ) @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] is non - linear with respect to the true .",
    "the non - linear relationship may well result from some combination of the preceding factors .",
    "our referee suggested that further insight might result from plotting  vs . to investigate this suggestion , we employed the abundance data in carney s ( 1996 ) critical compilation , where  as well as @xmath1}}_{zinn}$ ] and @xmath1}}_{spec}$ ] are given .",
    "the former  from zinn ( 1985 ) is essentially the @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] employed throughout this paper , while @xmath1}}_{spec}$ ] was computed by carney from spectroscopic abundance determinations in the literature , which he put onto a common scale of solar iron abundance .",
    "for the 18 clusters in common , we have computed @xmath65}}_{zinn } = { \\mbox{[fe / h]}}_{zinn } + { \\mbox{[ca / fe]}}_{carney}$ ] and @xmath65}}_{spec } = { \\mbox{[fe / h]}}_{spec } + { \\mbox{[ca / fe]}}_{carney}$ ] , where quantities on the rights hand side are all from carney s review .",
    "these are shown in figure [ cah.grp ] , top and bottom , respectively .",
    "the linear regressions ( @xmath65}}_{zinn}=0.35{\\mbox{$w^{\\prime}$}}- 2.36 $ ] , @xmath65}}_{spec}=0.32{\\mbox{$w^{\\prime}$}}- 2.23 $ ] ) , as well as the cubic relation found in  [ zw84 ] between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] , are plotted in each panel . the dispersion about the linear regression of  on @xmath65}}_{spec}$ ] is about half that of @xmath65}}_{zinn}$ ] , whose data suggest a quadratic or higher fit would be more appropriate .",
    "moreover , on the  interval in common with norris , et al.s ( 1996 ) figure 7 for stars in @xmath66  cen , the agreement of their slope and intercept is within the uncertainties of our figure [ cah.grp ] linear regressions .    from figure",
    "[ cah.grp ] , @xmath65}}_{spec}$ ] would seem to be linearly correlated with  for these clusters . in turn",
    ", this would seem to imply that the non - linear relationship between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] is not due predominantly to line formation physics .",
    "these initial impressions might be taken with some caution , however , because of ( a ) the caveats raised in carney s analysis , ( b ) the relatively small number of clusters in common , and ( c ) concerns about the unknown role of systematic effects in high dispersion analyses as a function of  ( and from one investigator to another ) .",
    "the foregoing raises important questions of what  is actually measuring over the parameter range of the globular cluster rgb stars , and what it can tell us about the formation of the milky way .",
    "we briefly comment upon the second query here , and upon the first in the next section .",
    "carney ( 1996 ) has carefully reviewed spectroscopic determinations of [ @xmath67/fe ] in globular clusters .",
    "he concluded that the mean [ @xmath67/fe ] values determined from silicon and titanium do not appear to vary over the range of [ fe / h]@xmath682.24 to @xmath690.58 , nor does [ o / fe ] for those rgb stars which are presumed to be unmixed , and they are all strongly enhanced relative to solar values . that the @xmath67 elements appear to share a common , uniform enhancement among the globular clusters contrasts with the halo field star situation , in which [ o / fe ] and [ @xmath67/fe ]",
    "are enhanced by @xmath700.3 to 0.5 dex for  @xmath71 and then drop to solar values ( e.g. , greenstein 1970 , wheeler , et al .",
    "1989 ) , in ways reminiscent of the relation between  and @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] in figure  4 .",
    "interestingly , among the @xmath67 elements in globular cluster stars , [ ca / fe ] may behave more like [ @xmath67/fe ] in the field halo stars ; however , carney suggests that the observed decline of [ ca / fe ] as [ fe / h ] increases may be an artifact arising from the use of neutral calcium lines to determine [ ca / fe ] in the available spectroscopic studies .",
    "if , as carney ( 1996 ) discusses , his interpretation of the fairly extensive hds data available for globular clusters is correct , it suggests that , contrary to evidence from field halo star studies , contributions from supernovae of type ia are absent from the chemical evolution of the globular clusters or operated on a very different time scale than commonly thought .",
    "this conclusion doubtless will be controversial , in part because of the contrasting field halo star patterns and in part because arguments exist for a smaller age range among the globular clusters than he advocates ( see , e.g. , hesser 1995 , richer , et al .",
    "1996 , stetson , vandenberg & bolte 1996 , hesser , et al .",
    "nonetheless , there is no doubt that the distribution of the @xmath67 elements provides a clue , perhaps critical , regarding how the galactic halo formed and , thus , it is crucial to understand the limitations of the  triplet as a metallicity indicator .      as reviewed in  [ indicator ] , the   triplet has not always enjoyed its current popularity as a relatively easily determined surrogate for metallicity . for the galactic globular clusters ,",
    "others have demonstrated , and we have confirmed and extended , that the triplet appears to be a sensitive metallicity indicator .",
    "however , as noted in the preceding section , carney ( 1996 ) raises concerns whether calcium participates in the uniform enhancement patterns exhibited by o , si and ti . if the galactic halo formed by mergers of smaller galaxies that had undergone independent chemical evolution , element ratios could differ from one set of clusters to another according to the history of supernovae and the mixing of their ejecta in the galaxy of cluster origin .    for our own efforts to determine ages of the far outer halo clusters from hubble space telescope photometry ( cf .",
    "hesser , et al .",
    "1996a , stetson , et al .",
    "1996 ) , detailed spectroscopic abundances will be quite challenging to obtain from high - dispersion spectra ; consequently , high reliance is currently placed on the  triplet as a metallicity surrogate .",
    "should the outer halo clusters by and large represent a different family , it is possible that calcium ( and the @xmath67 elements in general ) may have followed a different enrichment path than clusters in the inner halo .",
    "similar concerns might apply for other possible families of clusters throughout the milky way .",
    "although little evidence for deviations from the figure [ zw84.grp ] mean relation is evident for some of the suggested subsystems of galactic globular clusters , brown et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find from spectroscopic analysis of rup 106 and pal 12 that the @xmath67-elements are _ not enhanced over the solar ratio .",
    "at least when interpreting  triplet data for an individual globular cluster , we have strong evidence from color - magnitude diagrams that an internal age range does not factor into its abundance sensitivity .",
    "the same can not be said when interpreting the results of  triplet measurements in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( or other resolvable stellar populations where a range of ages and abundances are likely ) , nor , especially , when interpreting triplet strengths in composite light spectra . in such cases ,",
    "additional observational constraints on the parameters that affect the formation of the triplet lines are required for reliable metallicities to be derived from them .",
    "_    it seems particularly unfortunate that , in spite of the heavy reliance placed upon the calcium triplet in modern studies that strive to constrain the formation of the galaxy through metallicity and age determinations of objects throughout the halo , no thorough modelling of the triplet lines has been carried out in a way that would help resolve some of the issues raised herein or by previous workers . to our knowledge",
    ", the most comprehensive theoretical work on the  triplet has been done by jorgensen at al .",
    "( 1992 ) , but they only include calculations for @xmath1}}\\geq -1 $ ] , and they do not include the effects of line blanketing , which could play a significant role in depressing the pseudo - continuum for cool rgb stars in the more metal rich clusters . to help rectify this situation ,",
    "we have begun some exploratory theoretical studies of the line formation physics for the  triplet in collaboration with ana larson and alan irwin at the university of victoria .",
    "we are theoretically simulating the ad91  technique . among our goals",
    "is to determine if a non - linear relationship between  and  is expected from the line formation physics alone .",
    "the oxygen enhanced isochrones of bergbusch and vandenberg ( 1992 ) are used to define the  -  loci of rgb stars in globular clusters with  ranging from 0 to @xmath72 .",
    "full synthetic spectra calculations are then done using the ssynth code ( larson and irwin , 1996 ) , and a reduction technique identical to that described in paper i is applied to obtain  values .",
    "we strongly encourage other groups with the appropriate theoretical tools to examine independently this empirical diagnostic , whose relevance to many areas of galactic and extragalactic astrophysics is growing steadily .",
    "the globular cluster  scale is fundamental to our understanding of the age and chemical evolution of our galaxy . for more than a decade",
    ", researchers have relied on the  scale of zw84 , which seems generally to provide adequate relative rankings ( see  [ relative ] ) , but depends on the non - homogeneous  scale of frogel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) for an absolute calibration ( see  [ indicator ] ) .",
    "although the scale of frogel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) was state of the art at the time , some of their data and analysis techniques are almost twenty years old , and deserve revisiting using subsequent improvements .",
    "the homogeneous analysis of good quality , high - dispersion spectra by cg97 appears to be an important first step in defining a modern high dispersion  scale .",
    "however , the cg97  scale creates a paradox , since it is unclear at the moment whether @xmath1}}_{zw84}$ ] or @xmath1}}_{cg97}$ ] approximates the true  scale more closely . since",
    "this issue is not likely to be resolved in the near future , we have transformed our  values into  on both scales ( see table  [ feh ] ) so that researchers can perform their analysis using either .",
