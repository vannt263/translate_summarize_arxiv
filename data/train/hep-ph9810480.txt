    "the spin structure of the nucleon has been studied by increasingly accurate measurements since the end of the 70 s . by scattering polarized",
    "lepton beams off polarized targets , it has become possible to determine the spin structure functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these functions depend on the fractional momentum of the proton , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the square of four - momentum transfer , @xmath7 the energy transfer in the lab frame , and @xmath8 the nucleon mass",
    ". the results of the first experiments at cern  @xcite and slac  @xcite sparked considerable interest in the community , because the first moment of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , was found to be substantially smaller than expected from the quark model , in particular from the ellis - jaffe sum rule  @xcite .",
    "this `` spin crisis '' of the nucleon led to the conclusion that only a small fraction of the nucleon s spin is carried by the valence quarks , and that the main spin contributions should be due to sea quarks , quark orbital momentum and gluons .",
    "however , the difference of the proton and neutron moments , @xmath10 , was found to be well described by bjorken s sum rule  @xcite , which is a strict qcd prediction .",
    "recent improvements in polarized beam and target techniques have made it possible to determine both spin structure functions over an increased range of kinematical values .",
    "the reader is referred to the publications of the collaborations at cern  @xcite , slac  @xcite and desy  @xcite and to the references on earlier work quoted therein .",
    "while most of these investigations have concentrated on the high @xmath11 region , the recent measurements of the e143 collaboration at slac  @xcite have been extended to the range of 0.6 ( gev / c)@xmath12 1.2 ( gev / c)@xmath13 , which bridges the gap between low-@xmath11 nonperturbative resonance phenomena and high-@xmath11 perturbative qcd .",
    "it is the aim of our contribution to present the results of the recently developed unitary isobar model ( uim , ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the spin asymmetries , structure functions and relevant sum rules in the resonance region .",
    "this model describes the presently available data for single - pion photo- and electroproduction up to a total @xmath14 energy @xmath15 gev and for @xmath16 2 ( gev / c)@xmath13 .",
    "it is based on effective lagrangians for born terms ( background ) and resonance contributions , and the respective multipoles are constructed in a gauge - invariant and unitary way for each partial wave .",
    "the eta production is included in a similar way  @xcite , while the contribution of more - pion and higher channels is modeled by comparison with the total cross sections and simple phenomenological assumptions .",
    "the spin structure in the resonance region has intrigued many authors because of an expected rapid change from the physics of resonance - driven coherent processes to incoherent scattering off the constituents .",
    "in particular the first moment @xmath17 is constrained , in the limit of @xmath18 ( real photons ) , by the famous gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule ( gdh , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "the reader should note that here and in the following we have included the inelastic contribution to @xmath17 only . as has been pointed out by ji and melnitchouk  @xcite ,",
    "the elastic contribution is in fact the dominant one at small @xmath11 and has to be taken into account in comparing with twist expansions about the deep - inelastic limit at those values of @xmath11 .    in the case of the proton ,",
    "the gdh sum rule predicts @xmath21 for small @xmath11 , while all experiments for @xmath22 ( gev / c)@xmath13 yield positive values .",
    "clearly , the value of the sum rule has to change rapidly at low @xmath11 , with some zero - crossing at @xmath23 ( gev / c)@xmath13 .",
    "the evolution of the sum rule was first described by anselmino et al .",
    "@xcite in terms of a parametrization based on vector meson dominance .",
    "burkert , ioffe and others  @xcite refined this model considerably by treating the contributions of the resonances explicitly .",
    "soffer and teryaev  @xcite suggested that the rapid fluctuation of @xmath17 should be analyzed in conjunction with @xmath24 , the first moment of the second ( transverse ) spin function .",
    "the latter is constrained by the less familiar burkhardt - cottingham sum rule ( bc , ref .",
    "@xcite ) at all values of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the sum of the two moments , @xmath25 , is known for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "though this sum is related to the practically unknown longitudinal - transverse interference cross section @xmath28 and therefore not yet determined directly , it can be extrapolated smoothly between the two limiting values of @xmath11 .",
    "the rapid fluctuation of @xmath17 then follows by subtraction of the bc value of @xmath24 .",
    "the importance of @xmath28 for a complete understanding of the spin structure has also been stressed by li and li  @xcite .    the gdh sum rule is obtained by integrating the quantity @xmath29 over the photon energy , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the cross sections for virtual photon and target spins in parallel and antiparallel , respectively .",
    "several authors have pointed out that serious discrepancies exist between the sum rule and theoretical analysis based on the existing unpolarized data .",
    "the small momentum evolution of the extended gdh sum rule was also investigated in the framework of heavy baryon chpt  @xcite .",
    "the authors predicted a positive slope of the gdh integral for @xmath26 , while the phenomenological analysis of burkert et al .",
    "@xcite indicated a negative slope . however , the integrands of all spin - related sum rules are fluctuating functions of energy with both positive and negative contributions . therefore , even seemingly small uncertainties may give rise to large differences ( see ref .  @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "the first direct experimental data have been recently taken at mami  @xcite in the energy range 200 mev@xmath32 800 mev , and data at the higher energies are expected from elsa within short . concerning electroproduction in the resonance region , the @xmath33(1232 ) is being investigated at elsa , jefferson lab , mami and mit / bates  @xcite .",
    "the high - duty factor of these modern electron accelerators makes it possible to measure not only the ( total ) helicity cross sections but also the individual decay channels , thus providing a much more stringent test of model descriptions .",
    "the spin structure of the nucleon will be studied at the jefferson lab by a series of experiments  @xcite , which are expected to cover the entire resonance region and momentum transfers up to @xmath34 ( gev / c)@xmath13 .",
    "the outcome of these experiments should answer the open questions about the helicity structure at low and intermediate energies , the validity of the gdh sum rule , the size and role of the transverse - longitudinal contribution in connection with the bc sum rule and the generalized gdh integral , the evolution of these integrals with momentum transfer , and the contribution of individual decay channels to the spin structure functions .    in the following",
    "we review the formalism of spin structure functions and sum rules in sect .",
    "we then present the predictions of the uim in sect . 3 , and close by a brief summary of our findings in sect .",
    "we consider the scattering of polarized electrons off polarized target nucleons .",
    "the @xmath35 energies of the electrons in the initial and final states are denoted with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the incoming electrons carry the ( longitudinal ) polarization @xmath38 , and the two relevant polarization components of the target are @xmath39 ( parallel to the @xmath35 momentum @xmath40 of the virtual photon ) and @xmath41 ( perpendicular to @xmath40 in the scattering plane of the electron and in the half - plane of the outgoing electron ) . the differential cross section for exclusive electroproduction can then be expressed in terms of four `` virtual photoabsorption cross sections '' @xmath42 by  @xcite    = ( , q^2 ) , [ eq1 ]    = _ t+_l+hp_x   _lt+hp_z_tt , [ eq2 ] with    =   [ eq3 ] the flux of the virtual photon field and @xmath43 its transverse polarization , @xmath44 the virtual photon energy in the @xmath35 frame and @xmath45 describing the square of the virtual photon four - momentum . in accordance with our previous notation",

    "equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) provides an interesting model - independent constraint for the two spin - dependent virtual photon cross sections in the real photon limit .",

    "@xcite by the virtual photon cross sections ,    @xmath77    from the measured values for the asymmetries @xmath75 and @xmath76 and from the total transverse cross section @xmath48 we then construct the quark structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 by use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) ,    @xmath78    in practice it is difficult to measure the two ( unpolarized ) cross sections @xmath48 and @xmath79 separately by means of a rosenbluth plot .",
    "the structure function @xmath54 is then extracted from the total ( unpolarized ) cross section , @xmath80 , by use of an `` educated guess '' for the ratio @xmath81 . moreover ,",

    "the recently developed unitary isobar model ( uim )  @xcite describes the single - pion electroproduction channel quite adequately .",
    "however , for energies @xmath84 the contributions from other channels , in particular from multipion production , become increasingly important . at present",
    "several theoretical models are available for the two - pion photoproduction channels  @xcite , but little information exists on multipion electroproduction . in this paper",
    "we extract the necessary information from the available data for the total cross sections of real and virtual photon absorption on the proton  @xcite , assuming that the single - pion channel is well determined by the uim .",
    "in addition we account for the well investigated eta production channel by using the parametrization for the corresponding total cross section @xmath85 at the photon point as suggested in ref.@xcite .",

    "a value of @xmath91 provides the best fit to the total inelastic cross section up to the third resonance region and for @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "1 we present our results for the total cross sections at @xmath26 and @xmath93 .",
    "we have not yet included the contributions of the eta and multipion channels to the longitudinal part of the cross section .",
    "since the ratio @xmath94 is small in the resonance region , @xmath95  @xcite , these contributions should not be of major importance anyway .",
    "on the other hand , we find a substantial longitudinal strength for single - pion production at the higher energies , @xmath96 at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "hence we are led to the conclusion that the ( small ) longitudinal contribution is dominated by single - pion production .",
    "one of the basic ingredients for the asymmetries @xmath99 and structure functions @xmath100 is the difference of the two helicity cross sections ,    @xmath101    the single - pion contribution to this difference has been calculated within the uim approach . since the dominant mechanism of eta electroproduction is due to the excitation of the @xmath87 resonance , the contribution of the eta channel to eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) may be approximated by @xmath102 .",
    "the description of the multipion channels is the most delicate part in our calculation of the sum rules , because the mentioned theoretical models  @xcite for two - pion photoproduction were tuned to the existing data for total cross sections .",
    "the simplest estimate for @xmath103 is based on the assumption that the two - pion contribution is generated by resonances , and that its helicity structure follows the known behavior of the one - pion contribution @xmath104  @xcite , i.e. @xmath105 in the present paper we first account for the one - pion and eta channels explicitly , and then use the simple prescription    @xmath106    with the factor @xmath107 in the numerator providing the correct threshold behaviour for the two - pion contribution .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "2 , our results are compared to the asymmetry @xmath82 measured at slac  @xcite . as may be seen , the prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is in reasonable agreement with the data up to @xmath108 .",
    "we also note that the contribution of the @xmath109 channel ( dotted curves ) leads to a substantial increase of the asymmetry over a wide energy region .",
    "having fixed all the ingredients we can now calculate the structure functions and generalized gdh integrals .",
    "our results for the structure function @xmath0 are presented in the lower part of fig .",
    "2 . up to a value of @xmath110 ( corresponding to @xmath111 and @xmath112 at @xmath11=0.5 and 1.2 @xmath113 , respectively )",
    ", the main contribution to @xmath0 is due to single - pion production .",
    "the negative structure above threshold is related to excitation of the @xmath114 resonance . in the second and third resonance regions the contributions from the eta and multipion channels become increasingly important .",
    "note that with increasing value of @xmath11 the relative importance of the eta channel increases .",
    "this phenomenon is connected with the well known peculiarity that the helicity amplitude of the @xmath87 resonance decreases much slower with @xmath11 than for any other resonance  @xcite .      in fig .",
    "3 we give our predictions for the integrals @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the resonance region , i.e. integrated up to @xmath117 .",
    "the striking feature of the integral @xmath69 is the evolution from large negative to small positive values in order to interpolate from the gdh prediction for real photons to the data obtained from dis . as can be seen from the top of fig .",
    "3 , our model is able to generate the dramatic change in the helicity structure quite well . while this effect is basically due to the single - pion component predicted by the uim , the eta and multipion channels are quite essential to shift the zero - crossing of @xmath69 from @xmath118 to 0.52 @xmath113 and 0.45 @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "this improves the agreement with the slac data  @xcite .",
    "however , some differences remain . due to a lack of data in the @xmath33 region",
    "( see lower part of fig .",
    "2 ) , the slac data are likely to underestimate the @xmath33 contribution . since this contribution is negative , a numerical integration of the data points could overestimate the @xmath69 integral or the corresponding first moment @xmath17 .",
    "a few more data points in the @xmath33 region would be very useful in order to clarify the situation .",
    "concerning the integral @xmath70 , our full results are in good agreement with the predictions of the bc sum rule ( see fig .",
    "3 , lower part ) .",
    "the remaining differences are of the order of @xmath119 and should be attributed to contributions beyond @xmath120 gev and the scarce experimental data for @xmath28 . with regard to the latter problem",
    "we note that the bc sum rule , eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) , contains very sizeable contributions from the longitudinal - transverse cross section . in table 1",
    "we list the contributions of the different ingredients of our model to the integrals @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the real photon point .",
    "the convergence of the sum rules can not be given for granted .",
    "in fact ioffe et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that the bc sum rule is valid only in the scaling region , while it is violated by higher twist terms at low @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the good agreement of our model with the bc sum rule could be accidental and due to a particular model prediction for the essentially unknown longitudinal - transverse interference term . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , the contribution of @xmath121 is quite substantial for @xmath70 even at the real photon point due to the factor @xmath122 in eq .",
    "this contribution , however , is constrained by the positivity relation @xmath123 .",
    "the dash - dotted line shows the integral for the upper limit of this inequality and a similar effect would occur for the lower limit .",
    "this surprisingly large contribution can be understood in terms of multipoles . in a realistic description of the integrated cross section @xmath121 the large @xmath124 multipole",
    "can only interfere with the small @xmath125 multipole .",
    "the upper and lower limits of the positivity relation overestimate the structure function considerably due to an unphysical `` interference '' between @xmath126- and @xmath127-waves .    in fig .",
    "4 we compare our result for the function @xmath17 , defined in eq . ( 6 ) , with the calculation of ioffe @xcite for the resonance contribution .",
    "this representation demonstrates more clearly the importance of the higher channels , e.g. @xmath109 and @xmath128 .",
    "5 shows our predictions for @xmath129 at @xmath11=0 , 0.5 and 1.2 @xmath113 .",
    "in particular we note the following peculiarity of the @xmath11 dependence of the resonance and multipion contributions . with increasing value of @xmath11 the positive contribution of the @xmath33 resonance decreases rapidly due to the strong @xmath130 transition form factor . in the second and third resonance regions , however , @xmath131 changes from positive to negative values of @xmath11 .",
    "the reasons for this zero - crossing are ( i ) the helicity structure of the @xmath132 and @xmath133 resonances , which changes from @xmath30 to @xmath31 dominance  @xcite , and ( ii ) the surprisingly slow fall - off of the @xmath134 transition form factor  @xcite , which increases the negative contribution of this resonances relative to the others .",
    "both effects conspire to cancel the @xmath33 contribution already at @xmath135(gev / c)@xmath13 and lead to the observed positive value of @xmath69 at larger momentum transfer .",
    "the same cancellations are responsible for the rapid decrease of @xmath70 with @xmath11 .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that this integral also receives strong contributions from @xmath28 . in view of our bad knowledge of the longitudinal - transverse response",
    "we find it actually quite surprising that the uim `` knows '' about the bc sum rule and the predicted rapid fall - off with @xmath11 .",
    "we have studied the nucleon spin structure functions and the generalized gdh and bc integrals for small and moderate momentum transfer within the framework of the unitary isobar model  @xcite .",
    "the contributions from eta and multipion channels in the second and third resonance regions have been modeled by accounting for the total photoproduction cross section .",
    "we find that the role of the eta channel becomes more and more important with increasing values of @xmath11 . at the real photon point",
    ", this channel tends to cancel the contribution of multipion production .",
    "however , at finite @xmath11 the contributions of both channels add coherently . as a result the zero - crossing of the integral @xmath69 shifts from @xmath118 ( for the one - pion channel only ) to @xmath136 ( if eta and multipion channels are included ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that both the measured asymmetries and the theoretical models have to be quite accurate in order to determine the integrals @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the resonance region .",
    "as far as theory is concerned , a more quantitative description of the multipion channels is absolutely necessary . on the side of the experiment ,",
    "a measurement of all four virtual photon cross sections is needed to determine the quark spin structure functions in a model - independent way . moreover",
    ", the oscillatory behaviour of the integrand in the resonance region will require small error bars and a relatively small energy binning in order to give precise values for the gdh and bc integrals .",
    "the proposed experiments at jefferson lab  @xcite carry the promise to obtain such data in the resonance region and we are eagerly waiting for the outcome of these investigations .",
