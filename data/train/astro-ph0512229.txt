    "type ia supernovae are now recognized as one of the most important cosmological probes .",
    "astronomical interest has been focused on type ia supernovae since it was recognized long ago @xcite that they are good `` standard candles '' and hence are useful cosmological probes .",
    "their use as cosmological beacons led to the discovery of the `` dark energy '' @xcite and they are an integral part of plans to further characterize the nature of the dark energy equation of state with a wide field satellite probe , the `` joint dark energy mission '' ( jdem ) as well as ground - based studies .",
    "the reliability of sne ia as distance indicators improved significantly with the realization that the luminosity at peak was correlated with the width of the light curve @xcite and hence that sne  ia are correctable candles in much the same way that cepheids are @xcite . to date , cosmology with type ia supernovhas used photometry exclusively over spectroscopy , except that a spectrum is required for supernova type confirmation and can be used for the redshift determination , the luminosity at peak is always determined photometrically ( by matching lightcurve templates ) . however , there exist spectroscopic luminosity indicators first discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath0  @xcite is well - correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath2 at maximum light is also well correlated with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , the spectroscopic luminosity indicator should be well correlated with the peak luminosity , making it a useful secondary luminosity indicator for cosmological studies . even though it is correlated with peak luminosity via the photometric indicator @xmath1 , it is still useful as an independent check because it will have different systematic errors than light curve shape fitting via templates .",
    "we study the correlation of the two spectroscopic luminosity indicators @xmath0  and @xmath3   with luminosity , both for observed supernovand for synthetic spectra of the parameterized explosion model w7 @xcite calculated using ` phoenix`@xcite in lte .",
    "we define new , more robust spectroscopic luminosity indicators and we show that these indicators can be used with good accuracy via proposed jdem missions such as snap @xcite and jedi @xcite .",
    "while most type ia supernovfall into the category of `` branch normal '' @xcite with @xmath4 colors at peak close to 0 , there are known to be a class of bright `` 1991t - like '' supernovthat have weak si  ii  lines at maximum , but which develop characteristic si  ii  lines shortly after maximum light .",
    "additionally there is a class of dim `` 1991bg - like '' supernov , which are quite red and are thought to produce very low amounts of nickel , @xmath5  @xmath6  as opposed to @xmath7  @xmath6  for branch normals @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the diversity in the peak luminosity from the dim 1991bg - likes , to the bright 1991t - likes could be interpreted in terms of a single parameter in synthetic spectral models , with the dim , low nickel mass 1991bg - likes being cool and the bright 1991t - likes being hot .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the ratio of the depth of the characteristic defining feature of sne ia , si  ii@xmath8 , to that of another silicon line si  ii@xmath9  is correlated with the spectral sequence and hence with the peak luminosity .",
    "the obvious interpretation is that this is a sequence in nickel mass produced , although that interpretation is not completely proven .",
    "@xcite also defined another spectroscopic indicator using the ratio of two peaks near the ca ii h+k feature .",

    "the dashed lines are the polynomial fits used to determine the maxima found in the wavelength zones defined in table  [ tab : rsi ] .",
    "the two depths are indicated by arrows .",
    "the si  ii@xmath8  minimum band is centered on the si  ii@xmath8  line blueshifted approximately @xmath11  @xmath12(due to homologous expansion , it is customary to use velocities interchangeably with wavelength shifts when analyzing supernovspectra . ) . the value of 10,000  @xmath12corresponds to the average velocity at which the si  ii  line is observed to form .",
    "the @xmath13   wide wavelength zone where we search for the second minimum is noted as `` variable '' because it is centered on the si  ii@xmath9  line blueshifted by nearly the same actual velocity as the si  ii@xmath8  minima .",
    "this to ensure that the right trough is found , which is assumed to be at least partly created by the si  ii@xmath9  si  ii  line , thus it should form in the same physical region .",
    "@xmath0  is defined as the ratio of the vertical distances between each minima and the reference lines drawn between two consecutive maxima @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsidef ] ,    @xmath16    this definition differs slightly from the one of @xcite , where tangents to the spectrum were manually selected instead of the reference lines between two consecutive maxima .",
    "these two methods mainly differ when the zones searched for maxima only display inflection points , but our method was easier to automate .    finally , because it is defined as the distance between points of the spectrum and references linearly coupling points of the spectrum , @xmath0is independent of the absolute flux calibration .",
    "moreover , as it is calculated within a wavelength region only @xmath17   wide , it will be relatively insensitive to both the relative flux calibration and reddening .      following @xcite , we defined two zones in the @xmath18@xmath19  region of the spectrum , centered on the ca  ii   @xmath20  and @xmath21  lines , as shown in the right hand side of fig .",

    "cc 3650 & 48 + 3933 & 65 +    the maxima are almost _ never _ found at the exact wavelength of the ca  ii  lines .",
    "this is expected since even if we had pure ca  ii , effects other than resonant - scattering could move the feature s maximum wavelength .",
    "moreover , these features are line blends , and not pure ca  ii  lines .",
    "the study of these wavelength zones with ` phoenix `  showed that the dominant elements of these blends had lines displaying the same qualitative evolution as @xmath3  with luminosity .",
    "this leads us to propose that the maxima ratio correlation with luminosity is only a corollary of the existence of a correlation between the blends .",
    "hence , we defined an integral ratio we named @xmath27  ( the s stands for surface ) as @xmath28 the wavelength regions were empirically chosen in order to group all the contributions with the same evolution with luminosity than @xmath3 .",
    "we chose the wavelength limits in eq .",
    "[ eq:49 ] in order to produce a spectral index that is well correlated to luminosity and robust to wavelength errors .",
    "both the @xmath3  and @xmath27  ratios , like @xmath0 , are independent of the absolute flux calibration , and not too sensitive to the relative calibration quality or reddening .",
    "the main merit of @xmath27  over @xmath3  is the increased signal to noise ratio . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath3  and @xmath0  will be highly sensitive to noise since they rely on maxima and minima detections . in order to reduce this effect",
    ", we fit each wavelength zone considered with a @xmath29 degree polynomial and search for their local maximum or minimum .    because we want @xmath0  and @xmath3  calculation algorithms to be automatic and robust , we need to search wavelength regions wide enough to be sure to find the right maxima and minima .",
    "but in these large zones the spectral feature shapes are more complex than that of a second degree polynomial .",
    "on the other hand , noise may generate oscillations which will be followed by a polynomial of too high a degree .",

    "while other prescriptions for determining @xmath2 would give somewhat different results , with our small sample it is advantageous to use a single consistent prescription to determine @xmath2 rather than relying on a variety of methods to determine the distances to nearby sne  ia .",
    "when present surveys that will construct large homogeneous samples of sne  iain the hubble flow are complete , it will be simple and necessary to redo our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we do nt expect to alter our qualitative conclusions .",
    "@xcite were unable to determine a unique solution for the reddening to sn  1986 g , and thus we have two @xmath36 values for sn 1986 g which we carry through in our analysis . in the following",

    "we examined various epochs around maximum in order to determine whether or not the date of the spectra has a critical impact on the ratio s correlation with luminosity .",
    "moreover , since space programs like snap  will only take one spectrum per supernova , we wanted to quantify the time window where spectra are usable for luminosity measures with line ratios . note that jedi proposes to take multiple spectra of each sn , at 5-day intervals in the observer s frame .    on the other hand ,",
    "because of time dilatation , the rise time for supernovat @xmath42 is twice as slow in the observer s rest frame . relaxing the time constraint to @xmath43 days around maximum was thus conservative .",

    "<S> type ia supernovae have played a crucial role in the discovery of the dark energy , via the measurement of their light curves and the determination of the peak brightness via fitting templates to the observed lightcurve shape . </S>",
    "<S> two spectroscopic indicators are also known to be well correlated with peak luminosity . since the spectroscopic luminosity indicators are obtained directly from observed spectra , they will have different systematic errors than do measurements using photometry . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , these spectroscopic indicators may be useful for studies of effects of evolution or age of the sne  ia progenitor population . </S>",
    "<S> we present several new variants of such spectroscopic indicators which are easy to automate and which minimize the effects of noise . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these spectroscopic indicators can be measured by proposed jdem missions such as snap and jedi . </S>"
