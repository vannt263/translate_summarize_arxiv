    "the physics of light mesons has received in the last years several inputs from fixed target experiments with hadrons or photons beams and from @xmath2 experiments .",
    "the main aim of the published analyses is to clarify and to understand the very rich low mass ( say below 2 gev ) mesons spectrum .",
    "in particular it is considered of primary importance to find signatures of physical states that can not be interpreted as bound states of a quark and an antiquark ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in fact qcd and qcd inspired models predict the existence of bound states of gluons ( glueballs ) , of quark composites with more than 2 quarks ( 4-quark states @xmath4 ) and of bound states of quarks and gluons ( hybrid states @xmath3+gluon ) .",
    "all these states are generally called exotics .    in this paper",
    "some recent results in this field are presented and discussed .",
    "the scalar meson spectrum is a place where the so - called exotics are particularly searched .",
    "in fact the number of experimentally found physical states with scalar quantum numbers ( namely @xmath5 ) is larger than expected .",
    "so , while it is easy to accommodate pseudo - scalar ( @xmath6 ) and vector ( @xmath7 ) mesons in @xmath3 su(3 ) nonets , this is not true for scalar mesons . the list of the presently known scalar states is given in tab.[scalars ] .",
    "the states of the lowest mass @xmath3 nonet according to the particle data group ( pdg in the following @xcite ) are indicated in the table .",
    "as we shall see in the following the scalar nonet identification is still controversial and the pdg choice is only one among the possible interpretations",
    ".    new recent insight on light scalar mesons come from high statistics studies of three - body d - mesons and @xmath8 decays , and from @xmath0 radiative decays .",
    "three - body d - mesons and @xmath8 decays are analysed looking at two - dimensional dalitz plot distributions@xcite .",
    "this analysis has been applied to the following dalitz plots :    * @xmath11 decays where any @xmath12 pair is sensitive to scalar isoscalar intermediate states ; * @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays where any @xmath16 pair is sensitive to isospin 1/2 scalar intermediate states ; * @xmath17 also sensitive to @xmath16 isospin 1/2 states ;    0.1 in    . _ list of scalar states with mass below 1.8 gev ordered in increasing mass .",
    "the states in parentheses are included in the @xmath3 lowest mass nonet by pdg . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ scalars ]    in order to fit the dalitz plots two low mass broad states are introduced : a isoscalar @xmath9 and an isospin 1/2 @xmath10 .",
    "each experiment suggests values for masses and widths of these states .",
    "these values are summarised in fig.[sigmakappa ] .",
    "the values are in good agreement and the general indication is for an isoscalar state with a mass of 470 mev and a width of 340 mev and a isospin 1/2 state at 800 mev with a width of 410 mev .",
    "the broad @xmath9 state has been also introduced several times in the past , and its existence has always been considered controversial .     and @xmath10 .",
    "[ sigmakappa ] _ , width=491 ]    notice that the approach used by these experiments to extract the informations on the scalar states , has been recently criticised @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0(1020 ) is interpreted as an almost pure @xmath20 state . due to the ozi rule",
    "the decays in final states not containing the @xmath21-quark are suppressed . in this context the branching ratio of a @xmath0 going to a meson plus a photon depends on the @xmath21-quark content of the meson itself .    at a @xmath0 factory ( @xmath2 collider at 1020 mev centre of mass energy )",
    "the scalar states @xmath22(980 ) , @xmath23(980 ) and @xmath9 are accessible through the following final states :    *   @xmath24 and @xmath25 where the two pions are in a scalar isoscalar state ( ij@xmath26=00@xmath27 ) ; *   @xmath28 where the @xmath29 system is a scalar isovector state ( ij@xmath26=10@xmath27 ) ;    kloe at the @xmath0-factory dafne at frascati has analysed the decays @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite the observed branching ratios are both of the order @xmath30 : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the @xmath34 for the @xmath35 decay , refer to 2 different @xmath36 final states ( namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "the mass spectra of the @xmath39 and @xmath29 systems are shown in fig.[kloe ] .",
    "the spectra are fitted with a parametrisation based on the kaon - loop model @xcite and turn out to be dominated by the scalar particle production , any other contribution being negligible and @xmath23 are very close to the mass of the @xmath0 the typical breit - wigner shape is distorted .",
    "it is essentially multiplied by a @xmath40 factor , where @xmath41 is the momentum of the radiated photon . ] in the case of the @xmath39 spectrum a good fit is obtained only including a @xmath9 with the same parameter and mass shape found by e791 @xcite , negatively interfering with the @xmath22 signal .    if the quoted branching ratios are completely attributed to @xmath42 scalar+@xmath43 decays , as it appears from the analysis of the spectra , the standard @xmath3 interpretation of @xmath22 and @xmath44 is in trouble . in fact",
    "the only possible quark compositions of @xmath22 and @xmath44 compatible with the observed mass degeneracy is : @xmath45 @xmath46 requiring branching ratios of the @xmath0 to @xmath47 or @xmath48 of the order of @xmath49 ( due to ozi suppression ) , that is 2 order of magnitude lower than the observed 10@xmath50 .    on the other hand",
    ", this large branching ratio could be well explained in the context of @xmath4 model where the @xmath22 and @xmath44 quark structure should be : @xmath51 @xmath52 both with an explicit @xmath20 pair . in this case",
    "the branching ratios should be of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "kloe data on @xmath22 have been also analysed with an approach based on the k - matrix @xcite aiming to get a model - independent conclusion .",
    "the result is dependent on the details of k - matrix used , but indicates that , in contrast to kaon - loop model result , only a part of the spectrum should be attributes to the @xmath22 production .",
    "kloe has now collected about 500 pb@xmath53 while the results shown here corresponds to only 16 pb@xmath53 .",
    "higher accuracy results are expected soon , including also the decay @xmath24 .",
    "looking at the scalar meson spectrum , 2 possible scenarios emerge , indicated in fig.[scenarios ] .",
    "the first scenario assumes that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real physical states . in this case",
    "there should be a lowest mass nonet where the states are `` mass inverted '' as expected for a 4 quark nonet @xcite , and a higher mass nonet with the pdg states . in this case only one state , the @xmath54 should remain out , and it could be of gluonium origin .",
    "the second scenario assumes that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not real states and gives two standard nonets @xcite ( the second one could be the first radial excitation of the ground nonet ) .",
    "this scheme requires no @xmath21-quark content for @xmath18 and @xmath19 and so , it contradicts the current interpretation of @xmath0 radiative decays results .",
    "a second interesting subject is the recent claim of new states with an energy very close to twice the mass of the nucleon @xmath55 .",
    "the e687 experiment at fermilab has analysed the data on diffractive photo - production of 6 pions , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this analysis was motivated by statistically limited indications from @xmath2 experiments @xcite of a structure in the region of @xmath57 . in order to select final state with vector quantum numbers , as in @xmath2 collisions ,",
    "diffractive events are selected .",
    "this is done requiring the square of the total transverse momentum @xmath58 to be below 0.040 gev@xmath59 .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the 6 pion system for diffractive events shown in fig.[e687 ] has a clear dip at about 1910 mev ( that is 30 mev above @xmath57 ) while the distribution for non - diffractive events does nt show the dip .",
    "the fit shown is a coherent sum of a relativistic breit - wigner resonance with free mass and width and a diffractive continuum .",
    "a mass of @xmath60 mev and a width of @xmath61 mev are obtained .",
    "invariant mass distribution for diffractive events after correction for acceptance and unfolding of the resolution .",
    "the curve superimposed is the best fit .",
    "data and fit from e687 .",
    "[ e687 ] _ , width=302 ]    a state of similar mass has been also searched in @xmath62 @xcite , and recently in @xmath63 annihilation in 6 pions by obelix at lear @xcite .",
    "no clear signal is found in this mass region .",
    "we notice that a signal in nucleon antinucleon annihilation could be interpreted as an indication for a baryonium state .",
    "very recently the bes collaboration at the @xmath2 collider bepc , bejing , has reported a study of the decay @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath66 system is shown in fig.[bes1 ] .",
    "it shows a clear enhancement very close to threshold .",
    "distribution near threshold for @xmath67 events with fit superimposed .",
    "( b ) same distribution corrected for phase - space .",
    "data from bes .",
    "[ bes1 ] _ , width=264 ]    @xmath67 final states could be due either to @xmath8 radiative decay ( in this case the @xmath66 system is expected to have scalar or pseudo - scalar quantum numbers ) or to radiative return on @xmath68 due to the time - like proton form factors ( vector quantum numbers ) .",
    "bes angular analysis of the events close to threshold suggests radiative decays rather than radiative return .",
    "bes has tried a fit in both scalar and pseudo - scalar state hypotheses .",
    "the values obtained for the masses are : @xmath69 mev ( pseudo - scalar hypothesis ) and @xmath70 mev ( scalar hypothesis ) . in both cases",
    "the state is very narrow : @xmath71 mev ( pseudo - scalar hypothesis ) and @xmath72 mev ( scalar hypothesis ) .",
    "the states observed by e687 and by bes are apparently of different quantum numbers and of significantly different mass .",
    "so they have a different origin .",
    "several experiments can search for these states : focus can statistically improve the e687 signal ; babar and belle can access to 6 pions and @xmath66 production through initial state radiation , and study exclusive @xmath73 decays with @xmath66 in the final state @xcite ; finally cleo - c will study @xmath8 decays .",
    "we notice that a mass value of 1.9 gev , other than close to the nucleon - antinucleon threshold , is also the typical predicted value of the mass of the hybrid states in the context of the tube - flux model @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - scalar meson @xmath74 is considered a possible glueball candidate , or at least a @xmath3 state strongly mixed with a glueball . the @xmath1 wave function can be written as : @xmath75 since the @xmath0 is an almost pure @xmath20 state , the decay @xmath76 selects the @xmath77 component of the @xmath1 wave function .",
    "-@xmath77 plane from experimental branching fractions and su(3 ) based calculations . [ gluetap ] _ , width=302 ]",
    "kloe has measured this decay with improved precision respect to previous measurements @xcite .",
    "if @xmath78 , one has @xmath79 .",
    "the last condition can be checked using together the @xmath77 value extracted by kloe and two other results on @xmath1 decays and for @xmath80 . ] and putting them in the graph shown in fig.[gluetap ] .",
    "the crossing of the three bands is compatible with the condition @xmath79 .",
    "this means that at this level of experimental accuracies , there is no indication of a gluonium content of the @xmath1 . from the directly measured ratio of @xmath81 and @xmath76 , assuming @xmath78 and @xmath82 kloe",
