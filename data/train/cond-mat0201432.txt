    "the seminal work of anderson@xcite raising the possibility that disorder can lead to non - diffusive behavior ( the so called localized regime ) refocused the attention of the physics community on the problem of the propagation of waves in disordered systems . in the last two decades new theoretical ideas ( like the scaling theory of localization@xcite , weak localization@xcite , universal conductance fluctuations@xcite and wigner dwelling times@xcite ) were advanced , and a new field ( soon called mesoscopic physics ) emerged .",
    "it reached and influenced many experimental areas , among them electronic systems@xcite , microwaves@xcite , optics@xcite , acoustics@xcite , geophysics@xcite , laser physics@xcite , medical physics@xcite and atomic physics@xcite .",
    "it has become an extremely important problem in this field to understand what should be the signature of the propagation of a signal in the different regimes ( ballistic , diffusive , localized ) since concomitant phenomena , like absorption can complicate the interpretation of experimental results@xcite .",
    "it is for that reason that theoretical analyses of the characteristics of the propagation , and in particular its statistical properties@xcite@xcite , are of great interests , since those properties have become recently experimentally accessible@xcite@xcite .",
    "when the inelastic scattering length in a system is large compared to its size , the wave propagates coherently in the sense of its phase being preserved while its direction is randomized by elastic scattering processes with the impurities constituting the random medium .",
    "it is natural , then , to establish connections between the coherent propagation of a wave and the statistical theory of random walks@xcite , where the continuum limit is known to lead to diffusive theory@xcite .",
    "this connection is relevant to the propagation of an electronic current through certain layered nanostructures , since they can be  modeled as a collection of random one - dimensional interfaces , through which a coherent signal can be transmitted or reflected while being scattered at each interface .",
    "the connection between the effect of the disorder of the propagating medium and the statistical randomness of the mathematical description of the diffusion has not been satisfactorily clarified yet .",
    "one aspect that did not receive enough attention in this approach is the fact that , since the scattering with the impurities is not isotropic and the cross section is normally enhanced in the forward direction , the statistical jumps are not independent from each other . in other words",
    "the probability distribution of each step of these persistent random walks ( prw ) is dependent on the previous step@xcite .",
    "the prw are more difficult to study than the standard random walks , where the probability distribution of each step is independent of what happened in the previous steps .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that , for example , while a standard random walk can be easily mapped into a chain of non interacting spins ( in the presence of a magnetic field , if the random walk is biased ) , the same mapping for  the prw leads to a chain of nearest - neighbor interacting spins ( the full ising model for the case of a 1-d  prw)@xcite .",
    "in particular in this work we will explore the connection between the propagation of a wave and the 1-d version of the prw called the t - r  model@xcite , in which a particle moves with probability @xmath0 in the same direction as in the previous step and with probability @xmath1 reverses direction @xmath2 .",
    "this type of model is more suited than the standard random walk model to explore the quasiballistic regime , which becomes more important in transport phenomena in nanostructures .",
    "we will consider a model of the propagation of a wave first introduced for numerical purposes by edrei , kaveh and shapiro@xcite , and later applied extensively by vanneste _ _ et al__@xcite _ _  _ _ and sebbah@xcite .",
    "each site is represented by a scattering matrix @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4  ( @xmath5 being the dimensionality )  connecting the @xmath6 incoming amplitudes at time @xmath0 , with the @xmath6 outgoing ones at time @xmath7 .",
    "these amplitudes can be regarded as residing in the bonds ( 2 joining each site to its nearest neighbor , one in each direction ) .",
    "these bonds represent free propagation between the sites , and their phase can be included in the @xmath8 matrix .",
    "the wave function at time @xmath0 is , thus , determined by the complex numbers associated with each of the bonds at that time .",
    "numerically this has the advantage of letting the stationary wave being built step by step in time , from an initial input without solving a huge diagonalization problem .",
    "the matrices @xmath3 representing each scatterer are unitary and symmetric reflecting , respectively , the energy conservation and time reversal symmetry inherent to the problem .",
    "if we adopt the simplifying assumption that the scatterers themselves are symmetric , these matrices simplify even further , since the following relations can be easily obtained for their elements @xmath9+(d-1)d^{2 }   & = 0\\nonumber\\\\ r\\,d\\,\\cos[\\varphi_{r}-\\varphi_{d}]+t\\,d\\cos[\\varphi_{t}-\\varphi _ { d}]+(d-2)d^{2 }   & = 0\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes and phases of the elements for reflection , transmission , and turning ( in 1d , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath3 have , thus , only two ( in 1d ) or three  ( in d@xmath131 ) independent parameters .  for example",
    ", in 1d the scattering matrix representing one scatterer can be parameterized as : @xmath14{cc}% { \\large r } & { \\large i\\,t}\\\\ { \\large i\\,t } & { \\large r}% \\end{array } \\right ]   \\exp{\\large [ i\\,\\varphi]\\;\\hspace{1in}(r}^{2}{\\large + \\;t}% ^{2})=1\\label{1dmatrix}%\\ ] ] in this simple version of the model the distances are measured in units of the mean free path ( the distance between scattering elements ) and the phase velocity of the wave is one .",
    "the effect of the disorder in this model has been considered both analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite , by assuming a distribution of values for the variable @xmath1 , linked to the reflectivity of the scatterers .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the effect of disorder in the variable @xmath15 , more closely linked to the distance between scatterers@xcite .",
    "we will be interested in considering a signal incident from the left on a system composed of @xmath16 such scatterers , and in monitoring what is reflected or transmitted through it at different times , i.e. the output to the left of scatterer @xmath17 and to the right of scatterer @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "it is important to observe that while calculating the response of the system to an applied pulse implies adding all the paths of a certain length ( that will interfere by arriving simultaneously to the boundary ) , the problem of determining the response to a continuous wave is simpler , since in the stationary state it is sufficient to add * all * the transmitting or reflecting paths as long as the phase factors associated with the propagation through each scatterer , @xmath18 $ ] , are included .",
    "@xmath19 represents here the wavevector of the incident wave .",
    "the amplitude factor for any particular path reaching the boundaries of the system can be easily written , and we can sum all the possible paths by performing a loop expansion .",
    "for example , for a system of  two scatterers the amplitudes associated with the simple paths illustrated in figure 1(a ) are , respectively , @xmath20)^{2}$ ] , @xmath20)^{2}(r\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}$ ] and @xmath20)^{2}(r\\exp[i\\,k])^{4}$ ] ; the total amplitude for transmission through the two scatterers , when all possible paths are considered , becomes then : @xmath21)^{2}}{1-(r\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}}\\equiv\\frac { ( i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}}{1-l_{1}}\\label{t2wave}%\\ ] ] for the three scatterers in figure 1(b ) , the amplitude factors associated with the paths shown are @xmath20)^{3}$ ] , @xmath20)^{3}% ( r\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}(i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}$ ]  and @xmath22)^{3}% ( r\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}(i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}$ ]  @xmath23)^{4}$ ] , respectively .",
    "the bare  loop of length 2 has an amplitude factor of @xmath24)^{2}(i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}$ ] , and when fully dressed  by all the possible loops of length 1 becomes :    [ ptb ]    gq6c7p00.wmf    @xmath25)^{2}(i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}}{\\left ( 1-(r\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}\\right )   ^{2}}\\equiv\\frac{l_{2}}{(1-\\widetilde{l}_{1})^{2}}%\\ ] ] we see that the factor associated with a bare  loop of length @xmath26  is simply @xmath27)^{2}(i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2(n-1)}$ ] . in terms of it",
    "we can obtain a recursive expression for the general dressed  loop of order @xmath26 @xmath28 @xmath29 it is possible now to add all the paths through a chain of @xmath16 scatterers , the amplitude of the transmission through the system , and express it in terms of the loops : @xmath30\\;\\;;\\;\\;t_{2}=\\frac{(i\\,t\\,\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}% } { ( 1-\\widetilde{l_{1}})}\\;\\;;\\;\\;t_{3}=\\frac{(i\\,t\\,\\exp[i\\,k])^{3}% } { ( 1-\\widetilde{l_{1}})^{2}(1-\\widetilde{l_{2}})}%\\ ] ] @xmath31)^{n}}{(1-\\widetilde{l_{1}})^{(n-1)}% ( 1-\\widetilde{l_{2}})^{(n-2)} ..... (1-\\widetilde{l}_{n-1})}\\label{wavetn}%\\ ] ] as expected , @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath33 .  a very similar expansion yields , for the reflection amplitudes : @xmath34\\;\\;;\\;\\;r_{2}=r_{1}+\\frac{(i\\,t\\exp[i\\,k])^{2}% \\,(r\\exp[i\\,k])}{(1-\\widetilde{l_{1}}\\,)}%\\]]@xmath35)^{4}\\,(r\\exp[i\\,k])}{(1-\\widetilde { l_{1}}\\,)^{3}(1-\\widetilde{l_{2}}\\,)}%\\ ] ] @xmath36)^{2(n-1)}(r\\exp[i\\,k])}{(1-\\widetilde { l_{1}})^{(2n-3)}(1-\\widetilde{l_{2}})^{(2n-5)} ..... (1-\\widetilde{l}% _ { n-2})^{3}\\,(1-\\widetilde{l}_{n-1})}\\label{wavern}%\\ ] ] the expression for the amplitude of reflection through the system admits a clear interpretation in terms of a sum of all the paths that penetrate up to a certain depth in the system : @xmath37corresponds to the paths that do not enter into the system at all , @xmath38 represents the paths that penetrate up to a depth @xmath17 , @xmath39 are the paths that penetrate up to a depth @xmath40 , etc .",
    "the connection of this expansion for the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the propagating wave with the prw is provided by the fact that we can write exactly the same expansion in loops in the t - r  model , for all the possible paths of a random walker leading to transmission or reflection . here",
    "transmission means the random walker arriving to a point further to the right of position @xmath16 , and reflection the walker reaching a point to the left of position @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , if we ignore the phase factors @xmath18 $ ] and the imaginary unit in front of @xmath0 , the amplitude factors discussed above become the probabilities of the corresponding prw paths , and equations ( [ ldressedn]),([wavetn ] ) and ( [ wavern ] ) describe the dressed  loops , probability of transmission and probability of reflection in the case of a prw as well , since for a random walk the * total * probability of transmission ( reflection ) is simply the sum of the probabilities of each of the paths leading to transmission ( reflection ) .",
    "of course in each case , for a prw the connection between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is not provided by ( [ 1dmatrix ] ) , but by the simple expression @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to show now that the probability of transmission for a prw becomes , then : @xmath42 and the probability of reflection becomes simply @xmath43 .",
    "identifying @xmath16 with the length of the system @xmath44 , and taking into account that in this model @xmath45 , we can see that in the limit of large @xmath16 the transmission tends to the diffusive limit @xmath46 .    in the case of a wave ,",
    "the transmission or reflection probabilities are given by the modulus square of the expressions calculated in ( [ wavetn ] ) and ( [ wavern ] ) .",
    "this implies sums of the type : @xmath47 it is easy to see that , when adding the transmitting paths ' amplitudes , if we consider the contribution of only the first term in the expression above ( neglecting the correlations between the paths ) we will reobtain ( [ tnmrw ] ) , where the roles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are played by the transmission coefficient @xmath48 , and the reflection coefficient @xmath49 .",
    "it is precisely the overlap between paths ( the second term ) that leads to corrections to the diffusion theory results .",
    "in the case of the prw , knowing the probabilities  @xmath50and the lengths @xmath51of all the paths both in transmission and reflection , we are now in a position to study some of their statistical properties . defining a generating function @xmath52 , where we sum over all the transmitted paths , and a similar definition for @xmath53 where the sum is over all reflected paths , we can calculate the average length of the paths as @xmath54 obtaining for the average length : @xmath55[1-r]}\\label{lavertr}%\\ ] ] @xmath56 in the diffusive limit discussed above , these expressions reproduce the well known results of diffusive theory@xcite : @xmath57 .",
    "analogously , @xmath58 , independent of the mean free path .",
    "the expressions ( [ lavertr ] ) and  ( [ laverref ] ) are exact , within the model , and remain valid in the diffusive as well as the ballistic limit @xmath59 , and can be used to interpolate between them .",
    "this can be of interest in any situation in which the ballistic paths play an important role as in medical imaging .    in a similar way one can express in terms of  f(s ) the variance of the path length distribution , in transmission or reflection @xmath60^{2}%\\ ] ] obtaining the expressions : @xmath61}{(1-r)^{2}[1+(n-1)\\,r]^{2}}\\label{vartran}%\\ ] ] @xmath62^{2}% } \\label{vrf}%\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath63 is @xmath64 here .",
    "these exact expressions , which again allow us to extrapolate between the diffusive and ballistic regimes , in the diffusive limit tend to @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively . in the case of transmission",
    "the variance scales with the size of the system as the square of the average length ( non - self averaging property ) while in the case of reflection it scales even faster than it , exhibiting the well known noisy character of reflection@xcite .",
    "figures 2 , 3 and 4 exhibit the results of numerical  simulations of a persistent random walker on a system of size @xmath67 .",
    "[ ptb ]    gq6c7p01.wmf    [ ptbptb ]    gq6c7p02.wmf    [ ptbptbptb ]    gq6c7p03.wmf    the transmission and reflection probabilities , the average length of the transmitted and reflected paths and the variance for the path lengths in transmission and reflection are represented as a function of the transmission parameter @xmath68 in all cases the agreement with the expression [ tnmrw ]  and ( [ lavertr ] ) to ( [ vrf ] ) is excellent .",
    "an interesting problem is how to define the probabilistic weights to perform a similar statistical analysis of the length of the paths in the case of a _ wave _ , since the amplitudes are complex numbers with a phase , and the different paths interfere with each other .",
    "it makes sense to use the probabilities  ( in the sense of the moduli of the complex amplitudes squared ) as those probabilistic weights .",
    "as the discussion at the end of section [ loop ] shows , those weights describe the diffusive behavior of the system . adopting this ansatz",
    "we can define again the generating function as in the case of the prw , and we can reobtain all the results in expressions ( [ lavertr ] ) to ( [ vrf ] ) , again replacing @xmath0 and @xmath1 by the transmission coefficient @xmath69 and the reflection coefficient @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "all this analysis and the expansion in terms of loops can be easily generalized to a system in a higher number of dimensions . to fix ideas",
    "let us consider , instead of a row of @xmath16 scatterers , a strip of @xmath71 rows of @xmath16 scatterers each , where the wave ( or the random walker ) is incident from left .  for this system ,",
    "the amplitudes of transmission or reflection through _ one _ column become ( instead of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) the @xmath72 matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 , whose element @xmath75 is the amplitude for a walker incident from the left on row @xmath76 to exit to the right on row @xmath77 , and an analogous definition for @xmath78 .",
    "these amplitudes are obtained by adding all the possible paths that lead from the input @xmath76 to the output @xmath77 and are confined to _",
    "one _ single column of the medium .",
    "it is , then , not difficult to prove that the expansion in loops ( [ ldressedn ] ) remains valid as long as we replace in it @xmath0 and @xmath1 by these matrices , and all the products are understood as products of matrices .",
    "similarly , the transmission @xmath79 and the reflection @xmath80 through the strip of length @xmath16 are obtained through the same replacement from the  expressions ( [ wavetn ] ) and ( [ wavern ] )  respectively .",
    "if the signal impinging on the system from the left is represented by an @xmath81-component vector @xmath82 , the output vector @xmath83 simply becomes , for the case of transmission @xmath84 since in this model the matrices @xmath73 and @xmath85 have exactly the same symmetries , they will have the same eigenvectors ; those will also be the eignevectors of the complicated matrices @xmath79 and @xmath86 , since they are expressed ( through the loop expansion ) as products of @xmath87 and @xmath74 .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath79  involved in ( [ osubj ] ) can be evaluated in terms of those eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of @xmath73 and @xmath74 through standard algebraic techniques .",
    "the problem is , then , essentially reduced to solving the eigenvalue problem of an @xmath72 matrix .         to conclude we will illustrate the treatment of the two dimensional problem by considering the particularly simple case of periodic boundary conditions in the lateral sides of the system ( rows 1 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "we will calculate the total transmission through a strip of length @xmath16 .",
    "then , @xmath88 where the @xmath89 stand for the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath79 , and the @xmath90 for the corresponding eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 .  from the symmetry of the problem readily follows that one of the eigenvectors is @xmath91 and all the others cancel when summed over @xmath77 in ( [ formtn ] ) by orthogonality , leading to @xmath92 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath93can be simply obtained by replacing in the expansion ( [ wavetn ] ) or its equivalent for a prw the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 by the eigenvalues @xmath94and @xmath95(associated with @xmath96 ) @xmath97of the matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "those eigenvalues are simply @xmath98 for any row @xmath76 , and a similar expression for @xmath74 .",
    "for the case of a prw@xcite , ( where the walker has a probability @xmath0 of moving forward , a probability @xmath1 of moving back , and a probability @xmath99 of turning to either side , with @xmath100 ) , these eigenvalues can be obtained writing all the possible paths starting from position @xmath76 that lead to transmission ( reflection ) through _ any _ row of a 1-column system : @xmath101 the expansion in this expression corresponds to all paths with no reflection in the vertical direction , one reflection in the vertical direction , etc . ) .",
    "this is simply @xmath102 .",
    "analogously we obtain @xmath103 .",
    "the total transmission for a system of length n becomes , then : @xmath104 figure 5 illustrates the transmission through a strip of length 8 , for periodic , absorbing and reflecting boundary conditions , and for a 1-d chain of the same length , in the specific case @xmath105 .",
    "the inset illustrates the effect of snaking , the existence of a non - zero total transmission even in the case of a zero forward transmission @xmath0 at the level of an individual scattering .",
