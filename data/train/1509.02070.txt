    "the any light particle search ii ( alps ii ) experiment ( desy , hamburg ) searches for photon oscillations into light fundamental bosons ( e.g. , axion - like particles , hidden photons and other wisps ) by shining light through a wall @xcite .",
    "the aimed sensitivity increase for the coupling strength of axion - like particles to photons of the experiment is of 3000 compared to alps i. such improvements are due to the increase of the magnets length , to two optical cavities as well as to the replacement of the single - photon detector .",
    "indeed , the alps experiment sensitivity to the conversion of photons into axion - like particles depends on various parameters and is expressed as    @xmath0    with a strong dependency on the magnetic length @xmath1 and field @xmath2 .",
    "the effect of the optical setup depends on @xmath3 , the number of injected photons as well as on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the power build - ups of the production ( pc ) and regeneration cavities ( rc ) . finally , the reached sensitivity depends on the chosen detector s detection efficiency @xmath6 and dark current ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the data - taking time is expressed as @xmath8 . in the last years , preparation work has demonstrated the basics of the setup .",
    "[ sec : figures ]    the alps iia ( search for hidden photons ) optical setup includes two 10 meters optical cavities separated by a ligth - tight barrier .",
    "a 30  w 1064  nm laser is injected inside the first cavity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpsiia ] ) .",
    "such a system is technically challenging for two reasons : first , an alignment of both cavities towards each other is necessary to provide a larger spatial overlap of the modes resonating in both cavities .",
    "second , high power buildups ( pb ) are required for both cavities in order to reach the alps iia foreseen sensitivity .",
    "the aimed pb of the production cavity is of 5000 and the regeneration cavity pb is of 40000 . in order to maximise this characteristic ,",
    "the pc and rc need to be in the same modal phase with a mode - overlap of 95  % .",
    "the regeneration cavity is locked via an auxiliary green beam obtained via second harmonic generation ( ktp crystal ) of the pc infrared beam @xcite .",
    "latest tests showed a lower pb than required for the production cavity .",
    "possible sources of such issues are the mirrors coating , cleanliness of the mirrors , alignment of the cavity as well as a clipping in the beam pipes .",
    "usage of a cavity ring - down technique demonstrated a good quality of the mirrors @xcite .",
    "measurements will be repeated with a larger beam radius in order to enlarge the tested region on the mirrors surface .",
    "the regeneration cavity will be connected via a fiber to a single - photon detector in order to detect possible regenerated photons .",
    "efficient coupling of a @xmath9  mm beam inside a @xmath10 m single - mode fiber is feasible but still needs to be demonstrated to remain stable over longer time - scales .     for different levels of alignment @xmath11@xmath12 and for different focal length f.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   for different levels of alignment @xmath11@xmath12 and for different focal length f.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the coupling of the beam inside a fiber setup includes two mirrors as well as an aspheric lens ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] ) . in the test setup , a class 1 @xmath13 nm laser is shone to a mirror setup before being focused inside a standard single - mode fiber .",
    "it has been shown that the efficiency of the coupling depends highly on the alignement of the setup and on the focal length of the used lens ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] ) . during the preliminary tests ,",
    "an efficiency higher than 80 % was reached .",
    "the highest value for the final setup which has been currently obtained is of 53 % for a focal length of 35  mm .",
    "this value is lower than what was expected for such a lens . in near future",
    ", the beam quality will be studied with a knife - edge unit .",
    "such a device allows characterization and adjustement of the beam on micrometer - scale before it enters the fiber .",
    "the detection of a low rate ( one event every few hours ) of low energetic ( 1.17 ev ) photons requires both , a high detection efficiency as well as a dark count rate .",
    "additionally , the alps ii detection system is required to have a good energy and time resolution as well as a good long - term stability . to meet all of these criteria ,",
    "the alps ii setup includes a cryogenic detector of the transition edge type ( tes ) developed by nist ( national institute of standard and technology ) @xcite .",
    "transition - edge sensors are superconductive microcalorimeters measuring the temperature difference @xmath11 t induced by the absorption of a photon .",
    "the positioning of the detector within its superconductive transition ( 30% of its normal resistance ) is induced through a thermal link to a heat bath at @xmath14 and through a constant bias voltage . in order to obtain the cool - down of the detector , it is placed in an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( adr ) @xcite .",
    "the alps detector module includes two tess inductively coupled to a squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) .",
    "the alps detectors are optimized for 1064  nm photons .",
    "the sensitive area of each chip measures 25 x 25 @xmath15@xmath16 for a thickness of 20 nm .",
    "the substrate is surrounded by a standard fiber ceramic sleeve allowing connection of a single mode fiber ferrule @xcite .",
    "nist has demonstrated that such a detector can reach quantum efficiency higher than 95  % @xcite .",
    "latest measurements of the alps ii detector efficiency led to a first approximation of 30  % .",
    "optimization work is currently under progress .",
    "the alps iic experiment will allow the search for axion - like particles ( alps ) .",
    "it is constituted in the same way as alps iia with two 100 meters cavity and the addition of 20 hera ( hadron - electron ring accelerator ) dipoles @xcite to allow the conversion of photons into alps and re - conversion .",
    "the hera dipoles were all bent during their design , leading to a small aperture of 35 mm .",
    "it was foreseen to unbend all of the dipoles by applying a force in their middle ( cold mass ) .",
    "the deformation of the first magnet was successful , yielding to an aperture of 50 mm allowing to set up the 100 m long cavities without any aperture limitations .",
    "the magnet is working according to its specifications with a slight increase of its quench current .",
    "effort to straighten further magnets are on - going .",
    "the alps ii experiment aims at an improvement of sensitivity by a factor of 3000 compared to alps i for the coupling of axion - like particles to photons .",
    "this improvement is achieved mainly by implementing a regeneration cavity and a larger magnetic length .",
    "basics of the optics setup have been demonstrated but not all of the specifications have been reached yet .",
    "a tungsten transition - edge sensor operated below 100 mk has been successfully used to detect single - photons in the near - infrared .",
    "the author would like to thank all the members of the alps collaboration .",
    "the author also thanks the pier helmholtz graduate school for their financial travel support .",
