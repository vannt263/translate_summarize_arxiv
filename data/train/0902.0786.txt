    "the eclipsing binary lmc x-4 consists of a 1.25 m@xmath3 accretion - powered x - ray pulsar orbiting a 14.5 m@xmath3 o8 iii star with a period of 1.4 days ( kelley et al .",
    "1983 ; van der meer et al .",
    "the system exhibits a 13.5-s pulsation due to the spin of the neutron star and a long - period superorbital variation of approximately 30 d ( lang et al . 1981 ; ilovaisky et al .",
    "1984 ) , over which the x - ray flux may vary by as much as a factor of 60 . similar behavior has been observed in other x - ray binaries ( her x-1 , giacconi et al .",
    "1973 ; smc x-1 , gruber & rothschild 1984 ) .",
    "the standard model for the superorbital period in lmc x-4 is a precessing accretion disk that periodically obscures the neutron star @xcite .",
    "for high - luminosity systems , radiation pressure can generate a stable warp in the accretion disk , which then precesses due to radiation torque @xcite . during the low state",
    ", an observer views the edge of the disk and the neutron star is obscured ; during the high state , the disk face is revealed and the neutron star is visible @xcite .",
    "signatures of this obscuration are well documented in timing ( her x-1 , petterson et al .",
    "1991 ; smc x-1 , hickox et al .",
    "2005 ; neilsen et al .",
    "2004 ) and broadband spectral ( smc x-1 , vrtilek et al . 2001",
    "; lmc x-4 , woo et al .",
    "1995 ) studies of pulsar binaries .",
    "furthermore , high - resolution x - ray studies of the accretion disk corona in her x-1 indicate that the disk is in fact observed edge - on during the low state @xcite .",
    "there is also substantial evidence to suggest that emission lines in her x-1 and lmc x-4 vary with superorbital phase @xmath4 ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter jg02 ; naik & paul 2003 ; naik & paul 2004 ) .",
    "however , the relationship between lines and the continuum is complex and may require contributions from the accretion column , the accretion disk , a radiatively - driven stellar wind , or an x - ray heated wind from the accretion disk atmosphere .",
    "the extent to which these emission lines vary with @xmath4 depends on the true physical origin of the superorbital period .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy is necessary to decompose the spectrum of lmc x-4 into its physical components .",
    "particularly useful is the he@xmath0 emission line triplet ( from helium - like ions ) .",
    "this triplet consists of the closely - spaced resonance line ( @xmath5 : 1s@xmath6s@xmath7  1s2p  @xmath8p@xmath9 ) , intercombination lines ( @xmath10 : 1s@xmath6s@xmath7  1s2p  @xmath11p@xmath12 ) , and the forbidden line ( @xmath13 : 1s@xmath6s@xmath7  1s2s  @xmath11s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 can be used to determine the electron density of the emitting plasma for @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 is sensitive to the electron temperature in the range @xmath19 k @xmath20 k ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ; porquet & dubau 2000 ) . furthermore , because photo- and collisional excitation populate atomic levels differently , these line ratios can be used to infer the dominant excitation mechanism in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "we have carried out detailed spectral analysis of the first high - resolution x - ray grating spectra of lmc x-4 , obtained with the _ chandra _ hetgs @xcite and the _ xmm - newton _ rgs @xcite . these observations probe the transition from the low state to the high state of the superorbital period , revealing the physical processes at work .",
    "we present the first study of the plasma conditions in lmc x-4 with density and temperature diagnostics from helium - like species ; we exploit the variability of these lines to constrain the geometry and dynamics of the line - emitting regions . in  2 , we describe the observations and data reduction ; in  3 we discuss continuum fitting and line searches .",
    "we present and interpret the emission lines from lmc x-4 in  4 and  5 , and conclude in  6 .",
    "lmc x-4 was observed with the rgs on _ xmm - newton _ on 2003 september 9 ( 10:11:34 ut ) for 113.5 ks ( approximately one full orbital period ) .",
    "this observation took place during the high state of the 30 d superorbital cycle .",
    "the transition from low state to high state was observed with the _ chandra _ hetgs on 2007 august 30 ( 01:52:21 ut ) , august 31 ( 10:49:17 ut ) , and september 1 ( 16:18:44 ut ) for 47.09 ks , 50.96 ks , and 44.06 ks , respectively , for a total exposure time of 142.11 ks on the source .",

    "bad columns , including ccd chip 7 in rgs-1 and ccd chip 4 in rgs-2 , were flagged and subsequently ignored .",

    ", we also extracted a separate rgs spectrum of lmc x-4 during eclipse .",
    "the hetgs data were analyzed with the ciao analysis suite , v.  3.4.3 .",
    "after reprocessing and filtering the data , we extracted medium energy grating ( meg ) and high energy grating ( heg ) spectra , which have fwhm spectral resolutions of 0.023   and 0.012  , respectively . because the _ destreak _ tool can cause spectral artefacts for bright sources",
    ", we used the order - sorting routine to remove the acis s-4 streak . to achieve sufficient s / n , we combined all three hetgs observations .",
    "this may involve averaging over real phenomena , but the third observation is close to an order of magnitude brighter than the other two combined , so the effect should be small . in general , we do not account for orbital variability .",
    "we performed the following spectral analysis in isis ( houck & denicola 2000 ; houck 2002 ) .",
    "historically , the x - ray continuum in lmc x-4 has been modeled as an absorbed hard power law plus a soft excess , which is evident because of the low @xmath22 towards the lmc @xcite .",
    "the power law likely consists of comptonized photons from the neutron star .",
    "its slope varies between @xmath23 ; the soft excess has been described as a combination of thermal comptonization @xcite , blackbody radiation @xcite , and thermal bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "we set the minimum @xmath24 at the galactic value , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite and fit the spectra with various combinations of these hard and soft components .",
    "  and equivalent width @xmath27 ev.,width=3 ]    however , we are unable to find a completely physical model for the high - state continuum due to a broad bump near 12   ( see figure 2 ; also see jg02 for a discussion of possible origins for this feature in her x-1 ) .",
    "this bump is apparent in both rgs detectors .",
    "we model it as a gaussian with width @xmath28   and equivalent width @xmath27 ev . for this reason",
    "we will refrain from drawing any significant physical inferences from our continuum model . in order to achieve @xmath29 ( d.o.f .",

    "we include ten gaussian components : six for the helium - like triplets of nitrogen and oxygen , two for the ly@xmath0 lines of nitrogen , oxygen , and two unidentified strong absorption lines .",
    "the bump prevents reliable analysis of the neix triplet and the nex lyman-@xmath0 line . we let the fluxes of the gaussian lines vary when fitting the continuum",
    ", then fit all the line parameters separately .    among those tested , the best spectral model for the high state data",
    "is thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath30 kev plus the broad gaussian bump , the narrow lines , a blackbody with @xmath31 ev and a power law with @xmath32 ( constrained by the epic spectrum above 3 kev ) , absorbed by the galactic neutral hydrogen column ( @xmath33 @xmath26 ) .",
    "the absorption lines , which may be interstellar in origin , are found at 23.541@xmath34   and 23.7@xmath35  , and have equivalent widths of @xmath36 ev and @xmath37 ev , respectively .",
    "this model results in @xmath38 ( d.o.f .",
    "537 ) , which is not formally acceptable , but there is very little structure in the residuals and it is not our goal to model every spectral feature in the rgs .    because the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations probe different x - ray states of lmc x-4 , we fit their continuum parameters separately .",
    "unfortunately , there is insufficient s / n in the meg / heg to constrain the column density independently , so in fitting the hetgs spectrum we fix @xmath24 at the galactic value ( also measured by the rgs ) .",
    "to ensure that our characterization of the continuum is accurate given the low s / n , we group the data to a minimum of 40 counts per bin and include a gaussian emission line to account for the strong fe k@xmath0 line at 6.4 kev .",
    "the best fit for the hetgs data from 0.510 kev is bremsstrahlung with @xmath39 kev plus a shallow power law with @xmath40 the iron line appears at @xmath41   and has @xmath42 ev ; the model gives @xmath43 for 886 degrees of freedom . assuming a distance of 50 kpc to lmc x-4 , we measure unabsorbed continuum luminosities of ( 0.510 kev ) @xmath44 ergs s@xmath2 in the state transition and @xmath45 ergs s@xmath2 in the high state .    after finding a satisfactory continuum model for the hetgs",

    "we include gaussian components for the the triplets from helium - like species of oxygen , neon , and iron as well as lyman-@xmath0 lines from hydrogen - like nitrogen , oxygen , neon , and iron ( these were the strongest lines visible in our spectra ) , and find 90% confidence limits . because of somewhat low s",
    "/ n , we find it necessary to rebin the meg spectrum to 0.092   ( @xmath46 worse than the nominal resolution ) for @xmath47  ; the rest of the data are binned to the nominal resolution .",

    "we compare our spectrum with the xstar predictions for other lines and adjust the model to fit for the appropriate line redshifts and intensities . in this way we are able to estimate the dynamics and ionization state of the emitting plasma . in the case of the narrow iron lines in the hetgs",

    "the line emission from lmc x-4 is dominated by hydrogen- and helium - like ions . in particular ,",
    "the transition - phase hetgs spectrum and the high - state rgs spectrum contain narrow emission lines from nvi , nvii , ovii , oviii , neix , and nex .",
    "because of the absence of l - shell iron emission lines and the presence of rrcs from nvi and ovii ( hetgs only ) , we conclude that these are recombination cascade emission lines . as can be seen from table 2 ,",
    "these lines are all consistent with little or no doppler velocity . in the helium - like triplets , the intercombination ( @xmath10 ) line dominates .",
    "we will discuss line ratios in  4.2 .",
    "in the transition phase we detect a strong fluorescent fe k@xmath0 emission line and recombination lines from fexxv and fexxvi .",
    "a comparison of the transition - phase and high - state spectra yields an interesting discovery : emission lines from helium - like nitrogen , oxygen , and neon do not evolve in the same way as emission lines from the corresponding hydrogen - like species .",
    "our analysis leads us to the conclusion that at least three emission regions are necessary to explain the line properties in lmc x-4 . in the next sections",
    ", we will summarize this argument and discuss each region individually .",
    "because of chip defects in the rgs ( 2024   and 10.613.8   for rgs-2 and rgs-1 , respectively ) and low s / n in the meg , we will focus on the ovii triplet when discussing helium - like species . note also that the emission lines are grouped according to region in table 2 .",
    "the most striking feature of the variable emission lines in lmc x-4 is that while the emission from nvii and oviii is highly correlated with the continuum flux , the emission from nvi and ovii is not . in particular , while the equivalent widths of the lyman-@xmath0 lines from hydrogen - like n and o appear to be independent of superorbital phase ( at the 90% confidence level ) , the equivalent widths of lines from the corresponding helium - like species decrease substantially when the continuum flux increases .",
    "interestingly , the flux in the helium - like lines appears to be constant over superorbital phase .",
    "for example , oviii ly@xmath0 has @xmath183 ev as measured by the hetgs in the transition and @xmath184 ev as detected by the rgs in the high state . in comparison ,",
    "the equivalent width of the ovii @xmath10 line decreases by a factor of @xmath185 , from @xmath186 ev in the transition ( hetgs ) to @xmath187 ev in the high state ( rgs ) .",

    "further comparison of the transition state spectra to the high state spectra reveals a noticeable increase in the broadening of these hydrogen - like ly@xmath0 lines relative to their helium - like counterparts : the helium - like triplets have no significant velocity width in either the transition or the high state . in the high state",
    ", the nvii and oviii lyman-@xmath0 lines have @xmath191 km s@xmath2 and @xmath192 km s@xmath193 respectively . because the rgs is able to constrain the width of narrower lines ( nvii is narrower than 370 km s@xmath2 in the high state )",
    ", we believe that this broadening is real .",
    "if it is thermal in origin , the implied temperature is @xmath194 k ; doppler broadening arising from bulk motion is more likely .",

    "line weakens relative to the ovii triplet , indicating that region ii is not visible during eclipse .",
    "given that region ii is highly ionized , exhibits somewhat broadened emission lines , and is obscured during eclipse , we argue that it is located in the accretion disk.,width=3 ]    these results are difficult to reconcile with a single emission region with a variable ionization state .",
    "the fact that the hydrogen - like lines brighten by the same factor as the continuum while the helium - like lines do not change suggests that the hydrogen - like lines and helium - like lines are produced independently , probably in two distinct emission regions with different ionization states .",
    "the fact that the oviii line weakens relative to the ovii triplet during eclipse ( compare figures 3 and 5 ) also supports at least two emission regions .",
    "the presence of high - velocity ( @xmath50 km s@xmath2 ) iron during the state transition implies that a third region may be necessary to explain all the lines in lmc x-4 .",
    "the first region ( hereafter region i ) , is defined as the source of the helium - like triplets and weak hydrogen - like lines ( note that this refers only to n , o , and ne ) .",
    "the luminosity of region i is not affected by superorbital variations in the x - ray flux ; if it consists of a photoionized plasma , this might indicate that its luminosity is tied to the intrinsic luminosity of the neutron star .",
    "region ii is the source of the strong ly@xmath0 lines , whose intensity is tied to the observed x - ray continuum .",
    "this region makes little or no contribution to the helium - like triplets .",
    "region iii , for reference , is the origin of the doppler - shifted fexxv lines .",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , we define region i as the origin of the helium - like emission triplets .",
    "these triplets are useful for plasma diagnostics because their @xmath195 and @xmath196 line ratios can constrain the density , temperature , and dominant ionization process in the emitting plasma . given the striking differences between line evolution in regions i and ii , these quantities are particularly important for a complete description of this high - mass binary .    in nvi , ovii , and neix , we observe prominent intercombination lines , weak - to - moderate resonance lines , and weak forbidden lines ; for all these species , @xmath197 ( with upper limits of @xmath198 at 90% confidence ) .",

    "this cutoff is somewhat lower at high density . because the @xmath5 line is a combination of recombination emission , resonant scattering into the line of sight , and resonant absorption ,",
    "@xmath196 should be interpreted with care @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true during the state transition ( observed with _ chandra _ ) , when the pulsar is at least partially obscured and resonant scattering into the line of sight is almost certainly important . in any case , the observed resonance lines in lmc x-4 are weak , and we are generally only able to place a lower bound on @xmath225 in the high state , we measure @xmath226 using n and o ; in the transition , we find @xmath227 and @xmath228 for ovii and neix , respectively .",

    "furthermore , we detect narrow radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) from nvi and ovii . in the narrow limit ,",
    "the width of the rrc is proportional to the electron temperature .",
    "a joint fit to these two features indicates @xmath229 ev , or @xmath230 k. the rrc are too faint to provide confidence limits on @xmath231 with the redge model , but gaussian fits ( which are acceptable because the features are narrow ) imply @xmath232 ev , or @xmath233 k. because collisional ionization is negligible at these temperatures , photoionization must be the dominant process in region i. for reference , the continuum emission from region i falls below the spectral sensitivity of the hetgs and rgs .    given these results , we suggest that the x - ray irradiated stellar wind is a promising candidate for the identity of region i. we have already mentioned that this component contributes significantly to the uv spectrum of lmc x-4 , and we have seen that the temperature of region i is typical of an o - type star . at this point",
    ", we can not legitimately distinguish the stellar wind from the face of the secondary .",
    "however , the simplest explanation for the apparent absence of variability on the superorbital period in region i is that it occupies a large solid angle as seen by the neutron star , and the stellar wind meets this criterion easily .",
    "we shall return to this topic in  5 .      before discussing the lyman-@xmath0 lines from nvii , o viii , and nex",
    ", it will prove useful to describe the iron lines in lmc x-4 . during the state transition",
    ", we detect a number of iron emission lines .",
    "they are shown in figure 6 , with gaussian parameters in table 2 .",
    "it is straightforward to identify three of these lines ( at 6.4 kev , 6.7 kev , and 6.9 kev ) as the fe k@xmath0 complex , fexxv he@xmath234 and fexxvi ly@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the fexxv emission is dominated by the forbidden line , then these three iron lines have the same velocity at 90% confidence , i.e.  @xmath235 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because the critical density for fexxv is well above @xmath236 @xmath17 so its forbidden line will be strong for a very wide range of densities @xcite",
    ". two other lines at 6.1 kev and 7.3 kev constitute region iii and will be addressed shortly .",
    "xstar photoionization models of this spectral region which confirm our identification of fexxv he@xmath0 and fexxvi ly@xmath0 ( see  3 ) indicate @xmath237 at this ionization state , the contribution from helium - like species of n , o , and ne is negligible . for the state transition in lmc x-4 ,",
    "xstar predicts ly@xmath0 lines from n and o that are weaker than the poisson noise in our spectra .",
    "thus the weak narrow ly@xmath0 lines that we detect during the state transition probably originate in region i ; their strong , broad counterparts in the high state originate in region ii . disentangling the exact contributions to each line from these two regions",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper ; full photoionization modeling will follow in future work .        at this point",
    ", we can not proceed without associating the transition - phase iron lines with the high - state ly@xmath0 emission lines from n , o and ne .",
    "this association appears to be confirmed by the presence of the fe k@xmath0 and fexxv lines in the epic high state spectrum ( k. dennerl , in preparation ) .",
    "furthermore , the iron line model easily provides the high ionization parameter required by the absence of helium - like species in region ii .",
    "in addition , the comparable widths of the iron lines and the ly@xmath0 lines , along with their comparable small doppler velocities , are consistent with a common origin .",
    "thus we shall treat all these lines as originating in region ii .",
    "note that the ly@xmath0 lines become visible in the high state because of the correlation between the continuum flux and the flux from region ii .",
    "our association of hydrogen - like n , o , and ne with a hotter region of the binary also explains the absence of radiative recombination continua from these species during the high state . at an ionization parameter",
    "@xmath238 the temperature in region ii is @xmath239 k ( @xmath240 ev )",
    ". the corresponding rrc would be very difficult to detect over the bright continuum of the high state . if the rrc normalizations follow the scaling of @xcite , then the absence of a strong oviii rrc implies @xmath241 ev at 90% confidence . during the state transition",
    ", there is some evidence for a possible narrow oviii rrc with @xmath242 ev ( @xmath243 k ) .",
    "given the above discussion , we suggest that this feature , if real , actually reflects the contribution of region i to the ly@xmath0 lines .",
    "finally , we would like to determine the distance of region ii from the neutron star .",
    "we have an estimate for the ionization parameter in this region from the iron line model , but no density estimate .",
    "however , the fact that region ii is obscured during eclipse implies a distance from the neutron star of @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is the radius of the companion star @xcite . this is a weak constraint , but if we assume that the line broadening in region ii is due to orbital motion with a keplerian velocity profile , then @xmath246 cm , i.e.  well inside the roche lobe of the neutron star .",
    "we therefore conclude that region ii lies in the accretion disk .",
    "it should be pointed out that if the disk is cool and optically thick in the center but has a hot , optically thin surface layer , then it would be possible for both fexxv and cold iron ( for the fe k@xmath0 line ) to be present in region ii .",
    "this would also explain their similar velocity dispersions and radial velocities but different ionization states .",
    "however , if the width of the fe k@xmath0 line is due to a blend of several charge states , then the cold iron might lie outside of region ii .",
    "in addition to the three iron lines from region ii , we also detected emission lines at 6.1 kev and 7.3 kev ; the xstar model for region ii reveals no obvious candidate ids at the velocity of the three strong lines .",
    "however , the average of the line energies coincides with the fexxv he@xmath0 triplet , so we identify these lines as symmetrically relativistically doppler - split fexxv emission ( with velocities of about 25,000 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the existence of a number of faint unexplained lines near other strong emission lines detected at low energy with comparable velocity shifts ( see table 2 ) strengthens this interpretation .",
    "similar doppler splitting was observed by exosat during a bright flare : pulse - phased spectroscopy of the iron line suggested the existence of two line components whose separation ( @xmath247 ) varied with pulse phase and increased with the luminosity of the source @xcite .",
    "the natural implication of that result is that those lines originated near the neutron star , possibly in the rapidly rotating accretion column .",
    "this would explain why the doppler shift varied with pulse phase , and it is consistent with the visibility of the neutron star in the high state . in any case",
    ", it seems likely that this motion was dominated by the pulsar s @xmath248 g magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we consider the possibility that the doppler splitting in the state transition is also caused by the pulsar s magnetic field . because the iron lines in the transition phase have velocity widths of order 1,000 km s@xmath2 , we can conclude that they do not originate in the accretion column ( otherwise they would be broadened by @xmath249 by the spin of the pulsar )",
    ". however , material corotating with the magnetic field , e.g. at the inner edge of the accretion disk , could certainly be responsible for the observed lines .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate that material corotating with the neutron star at a speed of 25,000 km s@xmath2 would lie at @xmath250 cm .",
    "this result could place region iii well inside the accretion disk .",
    "in this paper , we identify a number of recombination emission lines in lmc x-4 ; by comparing observations at two epochs , we determine the evolution of these lines with @xmath4 and find evidence for three emitting regions ; here we discuss the implications of these results for the dynamics and geometry of this binary system .",
    "our analysis of the variation of emission lines reveals clear differences in the properties of helium - like and hydrogen - like n , o , and ne in lmc x-4 , which we detailed in the previous sections .",
    "we find it useful to suppose that these lines come from two different physical regions ; we will argue that the disk precession model for the superorbital period , which reproduces the long - term lightcurve , predicts the existence of these very regions and their variability .",
    "this argument is depicted schematically in figures 7 and 8 , which show the low - state and high - state geometry of lmc x-4 as seen from the orbital plane .",
    "first , we attempt to place constraints on the physical location of region i. without a robust density estimate , we can not use the ionization parameter to estimate @xmath251 nevertheless , in  4.2 we claimed that we can reasonably identify region i with the x - ray irradiated face of the companion star or its substantial wind based on its variability ; we expand on this argument here . in order to conclude that region",
    "i must occupy a large solid angle as seen by the neutron star , we must show that shadowing by the precessing disk is unlikely to produce a constant ionization parameter and line flux over the superorbital phase .    to do so , we suppose that shadowing is important , i.e.  that the illumination of region i varies like the superorbital lightcurve . between the hetgs and rgs observations , the number of ionizing photons in region i increases by a factor of @xmath252 , but",
    "its ionization parameter @xmath218 remains constant .",
    "the relation @xmath253 implies that @xmath254 must increase by a factor of 10 as well .",
    "but given the increase in the number of ionizing photons , region i must also be smaller during the high state in order to produce the same line flux ( in the optically thin limit ) .",
    "that is , the neutron star would have to illuminate a more dense , distant , and smaller region of the binary during the high state than it does during the transition .",
    "clearly shadowing results in a very unusual picture of region i. the accretion geometry is vastly simplified if shadowing is unimportant and region i is constantly ionized by the intrinsic luminosity of the neutron star , i.e.  @xmath255 ergs s@xmath2 @xcite . in this case ,",
    "region i is very likely the x - ray irradiated wind from the companion .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the low temperature of the emitting plasma as well as the small line velocities in region i and the importance of photoionization in lmc x-4 .",
    "furthermore , a relatively steady wind could provide a solid angle which does not change over time , so that its ionization parameter and line luminosity in region i are independent of @xmath256 at present , it is difficult to distinguish between the surface and the wind of the companion .",
    "but the precession of the disk should cause periodic illumination of the face of the secondary , so a more complete high - resolution study of line emission with @xmath4 might be able to resolve this degeneracy and possibly constrain the inclination of the disk .            while region i is independent of @xmath257",
    "we find that region ii , where the hot iron lines and the ly@xmath0 lines originate , is tied to the observed x - ray continuum .",
    "we argued in  4.3 that @xmath258 cm and that region ii probably lies in the outer accretion disk , which then fills approximately 50% of the roche lobe of the neutron star .",
    "here it is relatively easy to suggest how the observed equivalent width changes might occur . in the outer disk ,",
    "the neutron star is always visible , so the line luminosity is constant in time ( just like in region i ) .",
    "however , the projected area of the disk changes periodically , leading to stronger lines when more of the disk is visible , i.e.  the high state .",
    "it is also possible that the lines originate in the accretion stream , which is periodically illuminated by the neutron star so that its line luminosity is tied to the observed x - ray flux .",
    "this effect results in stronger lines during the high state of the superorbital period .",
    "jg02 found evidence for a similar increase in emission line strengths from the low state to the short - on state in her x-1 .",
    "they suggested that the variation in line strengths might be explained by the enhanced visibility of the disk atmosphere during the short - on . while it appears that region ii is a common feature of systems with precessing accretion disks , region i seems to be absent in her x-1 .",
    "in fact , we can use this point as further evidence that region i is the illuminated stellar wind .",
    "her x-1 and lmc x-4 both have very similar orbital parameters ; the main dynamical difference between these systems is the mass of the companion star ( @xmath259 in her x-1 and 14.5 m@xmath3 in lmc x-4 ) .",
    "thus we expect a stellar wind to contribute much more to the spectrum in lmc x-4 ; the absence of a region i equivalent in her x-1 is not surprising if our hypothesis is correct .",
    "it seems that for a system with strong winds , the existence of two emitting regions is a natural consequence of a tilted , precessing accretion disk , which illuminates different components of the binary in different ways .",
    "one region presents a roughly constant solid angle for illumination by the neutron star , so the resulting emission lines do not vary with @xmath4 .",
    "a second component might precess with the disk or see the neutron star obscured , just as we do . by assuming the existence of these regions",
    ", we can sensibly decompose our observations into a physical picture of an accreting neutron star with a precessing accretion disk .",
    "we also present evidence for the relativistic doppler - splitting of the fexxv he@xmath0 emission line during the state transition in lmc x-4 , and speculate that the lines originate in the accretion disk , where highly ionized plasma may be dragged along with the pulsar s rotating magnetic field at velocities of @xmath50 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we find evidence of comparably doppler - shifted emission lines at low energy which are present during the state transition but absent in the high state .",
    "we consider here the origin of such doppler shifts and the implications of the doppler evolution for the geometry of the binary .",
    "the conclusion that the doppler splitting occurs in the accretion disk is highly dependent on the velocity field of the disk . for a keplerian disk ,",
    "orbital velocities reach @xmath260 km s@xmath2 at @xmath261 cm .",
    "but the disk around a highly magnetized neutron star is truncated at the radius of the magnetosphere @xmath262 where magnetic pressure balances the ram pressure of the gas @xcite : @xmath263 @xmath202 is the neutron star mass in solar masses , @xmath264 its radius in @xmath19 cm , @xmath265 its luminosity in @xmath266 ergs s@xmath2 , and @xmath267 its magnetic moment in @xmath268 g @xmath269 with @xmath270 @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 ( from @xcite ) , we find @xmath274 cm . since the inner edge of the disk is much larger than @xmath275 keplerian motion is unlikely to produce the observed doppler shifts .    by assuming that region iii is corotating with the pulsar , we calculate @xmath276 cm",
    "this is much larger than @xmath262 so the lines can not originate at the very inner edge of the disk .",
    "however , @xmath277 might mark the edge of the inner disk warp , and a highly ionized surface layer of the disk might continue to corotate with the magnetic field out to this radius . thus we conclude that the doppler - shifted region iii lies in the inner accretion disk around lmc x-4 .    to clarify this model for visualization purposes ,",
    "we consider a toy accretion disk , also shown in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "note that in these figures , the system is viewed from the orbital plane , not at the orbital inclination of @xmath278 @xcite .",
    "this disk has a small but nonzero inclination with respect to the orbital plane , and precesses around the orbital angular momentum vector of the system .",
    "the inner disk is warped and slightly tilted with respect to the disk , so that the edge of the warp protrudes from the disk .",
    "the surface layer of this warp is highly ionized and corotates with the magnetic field . furthermore , because only a small part of this warp is visible the doppler - shifted lines are narrow , not broad , relative to the line splitting .",
    "but we have observed lmc x-4 at multiple epochs , and it seems that the doppler - shifted lines from region iii may not be visible at all superorbital phases .",
    "in fact , this doppler evolution is a direct consequence of the precession of the accretion disk : the changing orientation of the disk implies a maximum radial velocity in the accretion disk during the low state , and a minimum in the high state .",
    "thus doppler - split lines _ should _ appear and disappear at different phases .",
    "it seems that we have the first dynamical confirmation of accretion disk precession as the origin of the superorbital phenomenon .",
    "admittedly , the non - detection of doppler - shifted lines in the high state rgs observation does not prove that the disk precessed from edge - on to face - on .",
    "as such , we address the possibilities that the doppler splitting is not real ( perhaps an effect of low s / n ) , or that we observed two distinct phenomena ( and not emission lines evolving with @xmath4 ) .",
    "the doppler - shifted fexxv lines are both detected at @xmath279 confidence , so the conclusion is robust ; the concern over s / n only applies to emission from low-@xmath280 species .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that because the fluxes of the lyman-@xmath0 lines of hydrogen - like n , o , and ne are tied to the continuum , the doppler - shifted lines should be most detectable in the high state as well , but there are two reasons why this is not the case .",
    "first , the projected velocity of the accretion disk is smaller in the high state ; if the disk inclination decreases sufficiently , this effect could make the doppler - shifted lines difficult to distinguish from the stronger @xmath235 line . by fitting the rxte asm lightcurve and p cygni profiles in the uv ,",
    "@xcite determined a disk tilt of @xmath281 off the orbital plane .",
    "combined with the orbital inclination of @xmath282 , this result implies that the apparent inclination of the disk warp varies from @xmath283 to @xmath284 over the superorbital phase , so that doppler velocities in the high state should be a factor of @xmath285 smaller than in the transition .",
    "since our grating spectra can easily resolve such velocities , the projected velocity of the disk alone can not explain the disappearance of the doppler lines in the high state .",
    "second , and more importantly , the equivalent widths of the doppler - shifted lines should actually be anticorrelated with the continuum flux . in the high state ,",
    "only the fe k@xmath0 line , the fexxv line , and the fexxvi line are visible from region ii .",
    "as the disk turns its edge to us , the continuum flux decreases and the doppler lines appear , boosting the equivalent width of the iron line region .",
    "this effect was already observed by @xcite with the lower spectral resolution of the rxte pca .",
    "they found that the equivalent width of the iron complex was @xmath286 ev in the low state , @xmath287 ev in the transition , and @xmath288 ev in the high state .",
    "our spectra are consistent with this result : in the transition , we find the combined equivalent width of the fe k@xmath0 line and the fexxv line to be @xmath289 ev ; including the fexxvi line , the equivalent width is @xmath290 ev . if we include the doppler lines , @xmath291 increases to @xmath292 ev ( @xmath293 ev when fexxvi is accounted for ) .",
    "thus the rxte data are consistent with our claim that doppler - shifted lines are undetectable in the high state , appear in the state transition , and peak during the low state .",
    "high - resolution observations of the low state are necessary for a definitive test of this interpretation",
    ".    it may be that we observed two independent events in the state transition and the high state , but the observations can be explained with a single model .",
    "the spectroscopic interpretation of the disk precession model completely explains the variability of the emission lines in lmc x-4 with superorbital phase ; all we require is that the equivalent widths of the region ii lines be independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this simple requirement can be met if region ii is in the accretion disk or otherwise very close to the neutron star .",
    "then the observed flux in these lines will be strongly correlated with the x - ray continuum , and their equivalent widths will vary slowly with @xmath256 then as the disk precesses out of the high state , we observe additional doppler - shifted emission lines whose velocity and flux increase into the low state before disappearing again .",
    "only a handful of xrbs are known to have persistent superorbital periods , the most famous of which are her x-1 , ss 433 , smc x-1 , and lmc x-4 @xcite . to date",
    ", there has been very little systematic study of the superorbital variation of the strengths or positions of x - ray emission lines from the precessing accretion disk in any of these systems ( grating studies of ss 433 , for example , have focused on jet knots @xcite ) .",
    "such studies can be extremely enlightening , given the power of high - resolution spectroscopy to reveal the plasma conditions and dynamics in accreting systems .",
    "we have presented our analysis of time - averaged grating spectra of lmc x-4 in the high state and state transition of its 30.3 day superorbital period . in both states",
    ", we detected a number of recombination emission lines ; by comparing the intensities and ionization states of these lines at multiple epochs , we found evidence for two distinct emission regions , which we identified as the x - ray photoionized stellar wind ( region i ) and the outer accretion disk or stream ( region ii ) .",
    "we argued that the variability of these regions , which was similar to variability observed in her x-1 by jg02 , was a natural consequence of accretion disk precession .",
    "we also found evidence for relativistic doppler splitting of the iron line in the inner accretion disk , and possible splitting in low-@xmath280 recombination lines .",
    "we suggested that these lines constitute a third region , the inner accretion disk warp .",
    "although the doppler shifts should be much harder to detect in the high state , the variation of the equivalent width of the iron line complex with @xmath4 ( as measured by @xcite ) is consistent with our conclusions .    while it is plausible that we simply observed two distinct phenomena in the different observations , the precession of the accretion disk provides a simple and coherent explanation for all the phenomena that we observed . as the disk precesses from edge - on to face - on , the continuum flux rises ; emission lines in the accretion flow brighten accordingly . at this point ,",
    "the neutron star is visible and pulse - phased spectroscopy reveals the rapid motion of the accretion column , dragged along by the pulsar s magnetic field . as the disk turns its edge to our line of sight , the neutron star is obscured , but the radial velocity of the corotating disk is maximized , and we observe doppler splitting in the disk emission lines .    in this work , we have performed a new high - resolution study of x - ray emission line variability with superorbital phase in lmc x-4 .",
    "accordingly , we are able to report a new spectral confirmation of accretion disk precession as the origin of the superorbital period .",
    "the variable doppler shifts from the inner accretion disk and the relative evolution of other emission lines in lmc x-4 are fully consistent with and predicted by the precession of the accretion disk .",
    "future high spectral resolution observations at the peak of the high state and during the low state will go a long way towards a systematic test of this model for accretion dynamics in x - ray binaries .",
