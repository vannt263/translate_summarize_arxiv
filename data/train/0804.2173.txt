    "<S> we describe the interaction between an electromagnetic field and a long josephson junction ( jj ) driven by a dc current . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the amplitudes of emission and absorption of light via the creation and annihilation of quantized josephson plasma waves ( jpws ) . </S>",
    "<S> both , the energies of jpw quanta and the amplitudes of light absorption and emission , strongly depend on the junction s length and can be tuned by an applied dc current . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , photon - assisted macroscopic quantum tunnelling in long josephson junctions show resonances when the frequency of the outside radiation coincides with the current - driven eigenfrequencies of the quantized jpws . </S>"
