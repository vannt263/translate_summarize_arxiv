    "the study of the force felt by an atom near a surface has recently become a popular subject of research ( see for example @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) both in view of nanotechnological applications @xcite and because of the possibility of investigating fundamental forces at the submicron scale @xcite .",
    "these studies extend previous investigations of the generalized van der waals forces between macroscopic bodies @xcite to more microscopic systems .",
    "experiments with bose - einstein condensates near a surface @xcite are very promising in this respect because of the high accuracy of the measurements achievable with ultracold gases .    historically the interatomic forces were first introduced in 1873 by van der waals in order to explain the deviations of the thermodynamic behaviour of real gases from the ideal laws . only in 1930",
    "london @xcite provided a first quantitative description of the force .",
    "he applied second order perturbation theory to the quantum hamiltonian to evaluate the electrostatic interaction between two dipoles , induced by the fluctuation of the electromagnetic field .",
    "he succeeded in deriving the most famous power law @xmath3 , usually known as the van der waals - london interaction , where @xmath4 is the interatomic distance .",
    "almost twenty years later , in 1948 , casimir and polder @xcite , taking into account relativistic retardation effects within fourth order perturbation theory , found that , at large distances , the potential decays like @xmath5 rather than like @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of these attractive forces between neutral atoms gives rise to analogous forces between a single atom and a dielectric or a metallic wall , as well as to forces between macroscopic bodies separated by small distances @xcite . between the end of the fifties and the beginning of sixties",
    "lifshitz developed the general theory of the van der waals forces @xcite for inhomogeneous media , taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and their perturbation produced by the media .",
    "the theory describes the interaction between continuous media in terms of their dielectric functions and of the temperature .",
    "the van der waals - london and casimir - polder forces are recovered as limiting cases of the more general theory , which also accounts for the effects induced by the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "thermal effects provide the asymptotic behaviour of the interaction at distances much larger than the thermal wave length of photons .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to show that the study of the collective oscillations of a bose - einstein condensate of ultracold atoms can provide a useful probe of such forces .",
    "bose - einstein condensates are very dilute samples and consequently the force produced by the surface can be safely calculated starting from the interaction felt by the individual atoms in the condensate @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the center of mass oscillation of a condensate confined by a harmonic trap .",
    "the center of mass motion has the main advantage of being independent of two - body interactions and its frequency consequently provides an ideal probe of the additional force generated by the wall .",
    "the effect of the force on the frequency of the center of mass oscillation depends on the distance of the condensate from the surface , on the temperature of the surface as well as on the optical properties of the surface and of the atoms in the condensate .",
    "the effect also depends on the thickness of the condensate which in actual configurations can be of the same order as the distance from the wall . in some limiting cases , corresponding to short and large distances , it is possible to obtain analytic or semi - analytic predictions that will be discussed systematically in our paper .",
    "they can serve as a natural guide for first quantitative estimates and as useful tests of more complete numerical approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in sect.2 we derive some general results for the shift of the collective frequencies of a harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate subject to an additional weak external force .",
    "in sect.3 we employ lifchitz theory to calculate the force acting on a dilute atomic gas placed near a surface .    in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the transition from the van der waals - london potential , holding at very short distances from the surface and decaying like @xmath6 , to the casimir - polder potential which accounts for relativistic retardation effects and holds at larger distances where it decays like @xmath7 .    in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the transition from the @xmath7 law characterizing the casimir polder potential to the behaviour of the potential at much larger distances from the surface ( larger than the thermal wavelength of photons ) where it decays like @xmath6 as a consequence of the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .    in sect .",
    "6 we discuss the role of the optical properties of the interacting media with specific emphasis to the case of the dielectric sapphire ( @xmath8 ) substrate and of the rubidium atoms which form the condensate .    in sect .",
    "7 we provide results for the shifts of the collective frequencies as a function of the distance of the condensate from the surface , calculated at different temperatures .    finally , in appendix a1 we provide results for the frequency shift of the radial compression mode in very elongated harmonic traps .",
    "after the first experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute vapours of alkali atoms the experimental and theoretical research in the field of ultacold quantum gases has grown in an impressive way ( for general reviews see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "bose - einstein condensed gases are dilute , ultracold samples characterized by unique properties of coherence and superfluidity .",
    "they give rise , among others , to interference phenomena @xcite as well as to a variety of collective oscillations @xcite . the relatively high density of bose - einstein condensed samples ( compared to the one of non condensed trapped gases ) , as well as the possibility of imaging the atomic cloud after expansion , where the measured sizes become macroscopically large , permit to achieve very accurate determinations of the frequencies of the collective oscillations , thereby providing interesting opportunities for precision measurements .",
    "in this section we will calculate the effect of a weak perturbation on the center of mass oscillation of a harmonically trapped gas .",
    "the frequency of this oscillation , in the absence of the perturbation , coincides with the frequency of the trap .",
    "this result , also known as kohn theorem @xcite , is independent of the amplitude of the oscillation , interatomic forces , temperature as well as of the quantum nature of the sample .",
    "deviations of the measured frequency from the oscillator value can then be used as a useful probe of additional interactions , like the one generated by the surface . in fig.1",
    "we show a schematic representation of the geometry considered in the present work .",
    "a dilute gas trapped by the harmonic potential @xmath9 is placed close to an ideal wall generating a potential @xmath10 so that the full potential felt by each atom is given by @xmath11 in the following we will calculate the changes in the frequency of the center of mass oscillation along the @xmath12-th direction caused by the presence of the surface . in the appendix we provide results also for the radial breathing mode in the case of very elongated axi - symmetric traps ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the equations for the center of mass coordinate @xmath14 and the total momentum @xmath15 along the @xmath12-th direction ( @xmath16 is the number of atoms of the trapped gas ) can be written in the general form @xmath17 and @xmath18 where we have used expression ( [ vho ] ) for @xmath19 and we have expressed the average of the external force @xmath20 in terms of the density @xmath21 of the gas here assumed to be normalized to unity ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "notice that the equation for the total momentum is not affected by the two - body potential . in the absence of the perturbation ( @xmath23 ) one recovers the equations of the harmonic oscillator and the center of mass oscillation corresponds to a rigid oscillation of the density .",
    "the effect of the perturbation @xmath24 can then be calculated , in first order perturbation theory , using the scaling ansatz @xmath25 in ( [ p ] ) , where @xmath26 is the equilibrium density of the gas . the equation for the center of mass",
    "coordinate finally takes the simple form @xmath27 where , in the integral , we have made the substitution @xmath28 .",
    "equations ( [ z ] ) and ( [ psimple ] ) have now a closed form . in the limit of small oscillations",
    "we can expand the perturbation term up to terms linear in @xmath29 and the equation for the center of mass takes again a harmonic form with the renormalized oscillator frequency @xmath30 it is worth stressing that result ( [ omegad ] ) is exact up to first order corrections in @xmath24 and holds independently of the quantum or classical nature of the gas which instead determines the actual form of the density profile @xmath26 .",
    "eq.([omegad ] ) can be further simplified by introducing the so called 1d column density @xmath31 and using the fact that @xmath24 depends only on the @xmath12-th coordinate .",
    "one then finds the result @xmath32    equation ( [ omegad0 ] ) shows that the ingredients needed to calculate the effect of the perturbation on the shift of the center of mass frequency are the explicit form of the potential @xmath24 , which will be discussed in the following sections , and the 1d column density ( [ n1 ] ) . for a bose - eintsein condensate in its ground state",
    "the density profile is easily evaluated in the so called thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "this approximation holds for large condensates where , for gases interacting with positive scattering length , the kinetic energy of the trapped condensate can be neglected and one finds the analytic result @xcite @xmath33 when @xmath34 and @xmath35 elsewhere . here",
    "@xmath36 is the chemical potential , @xmath16 is the number of atoms , @xmath37 is the geometrical average of the three trap frequences , @xmath38 is the oscillator length and @xmath39 is the interaction coupling constant fixed by the s - wave scattering length @xmath40 .",
    "integration of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 yields @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the thomas - fermi radius in the @xmath12-th direction , fixed by the relation @xmath45 .",
    "typical values for @xmath44 in standard experimental conditions can be of the order of a few microns @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ omegad0 ] ) and ( [ n1bec ] ) are the key result of this section and will be used in the second part of the paper to calculate the effect of the force produced by the surface on the frequency shift of the center of mass oscillation .",
    "the integral ( [ omegad0 ] ) should be in general carried out numerically .",
    "there are , however , important cases where the integration can be found analytically .",
    "this is the case , for example , if one can approximate the potential with the algebraic decay @xmath46 where @xmath4 is the distance between the wall and the center of the harmonic trap @xcite . in this case",
    "we find the result @xmath47 and @xmath48}{(1-\\chi^2)^2\\;\\chi^5}.\\ ] ] for the most relevant @xmath49 and @xmath50 cases , respectively , where @xmath51 .",
    "results ( [ gamma4 ] ) and ( [ gamma3 ] ) explicitly point out the role played by the finite size of the condensate .",
    "in particular , only in the limit @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) will the above equations approach the power law behaviours @xmath3 and @xmath54 for the frequency shift expected for a point - like condensate .",
    "the above results have been derived in the linear regime .",
    "if the amplitude of the oscillation is comparable to the distance from the surface non linear effects become important and modify the value of the frequency shift .",
    "non linear effects result in a frequency shift as well as in the occurrence of higher harmonics .",
    "they can be calculated starting from the general equations ( [ z ] ) and ( [ psimple ] ) for the center of mass coordinate .",
    "notice that , due to the harmonic nature of @xmath19 , both effects are absent if @xmath23 . due to the perturbative nature of the problem",
    "we can use the periodic law @xmath55 to evaluate the integral of ( [ psimple ] ) , where @xmath40 is the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "one can then introduce the periodic function @xmath56 which can be conveniently expanded in a fourier series .",
    "for the calculation of the frequency shift only the term proportional to @xmath57 is important and one can write @xmath58 expansion of ( [ 5lev ] ) up to terms quadratic in @xmath40 and use of the 1d column density finally yield the result @xmath59 for the frequency shift which generalizes eq.([omegad0 ] ) by including the non linear correction in @xmath60 .",
    "the interaction produced by a surface on a single atom includes , in its general form , non trivial relativistic effects as well as quantum and thermal fluctuations of the field .",
    "the force can be calculated starting from the general theory devoloped by lifchitz for the free energy associated with inhomogeneous media . for two plates separated by a distance @xmath4 and in thermal equilibrium with the thermal radiation at temperature @xmath61",

    "some general properties of these functions will be illustrated in sect vi .",
    "the force produced by a surface on a single atom can be easily derived by assuming that one of the two walls ( wall 2 ) is made of a very dilute material ( for example a gas ) so that one can expand eq.([surfacesurface ] ) for small values of @xmath77 where @xmath21 is the density of the gas and @xmath78 is the corresponding atomic polarizability .",

    "result ( [ l ] ) is still expected to be valid in this case , @xmath61 being the temperature of the substrate .",
    "in fact atoms , independently of being at zero or at room temperature , do not contribute to the thermal radiation , their lowest excitation energies being much higher than @xmath89 .",
    "it is useful to identify the relevant length scales of the problem ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "a first important length is the thermal wavelength of the photon : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the boltzmann constant . at room temperature ( @xmath92 )",

    "is dominated by the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . in this limit",
    "the leading contribution is given by the first term in eq.([l ] ) , due to the occurrence of the exponential factor in the other terms , and the potential takes the characteristic form @xmath95 notice that in this regime only the static value of the dielectric and polarizability functions contribute to the force .",
    "it is also worth noticing that in this limit the force is independent of the planck constant as well as of the velocity of light .    for distances",
    "@xmath4 smaller ( or of the same order ) than @xmath94 the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field become important and the terms of the sum ( [ l ] ) should be taken into account .",
    "if @xmath96 and @xmath61 is sufficiently small , one can replace the sum with an integral ( see sect.iv ) . in this regime one",
    "can introduce a second length scale , hereafter called @xmath97 .",
    "this length is related to the relevant wavelengths characterizing the optical properties of the interacting media .",
    "one can identify two distinct regimes . for distances @xmath98 the potential exhibits the familiar @xmath6 van der waals - london dependence . in the interval",
    "@xmath99 one instead enters the casimir - polder regime where the potential decays like @xmath7 .",
    "the possibility of identifying the casimir - polder regime depends crucially on the value of the temperature .",
    "the temperature should be in fact sufficiently low in order to guarantee the condition @xmath100 ( see discussion at the end of sect .",
    "v ) . differently from the thermal wawelength , given by the simple expression @xmath94 ,",
    "the explicit evaluation of @xmath97 is not immediate because the optical properties of the media are not characterized by a single frequency ( see sect.vi ) . in the case of rubidium atoms interacting with a dielectric sapphire substrate we find @xmath101 .",
    "as anticipated in the preceding section at distances smaller than the thermal wavelength also the terms in the sum ( [ l ] ) contribute to the force and , if @xmath96 and the temperature is sufficiently low , the sum is conveniently replaced by an integral : @xmath102 .",
    "one then finds the useful expression @xmath103 for the potential , also called short range ( sr ) approximation .",

    "the coefficient characterizing this force is fixed by the optical properties of the media .",

    "( [ l0large ] ) ) potentials , as well as the asymptotic thermal law @xmath113 $ ] evaluated at @xmath114 ( see eq.([hight ] ) ) , are also shown ( @xmath4 is here expressed in microns ) .",

    "the two limits apply , respectively , to distances larger and smaller than the thermal wavelength ( [ lambdat ] ) .",
    "it then follows that the static approximation ( [ vg ] ) provides the transition from the casimir - polder law ( [ l0large ] ) holding for @xmath128 , to the thermal law ( [ hight ] ) holding for @xmath129 . in fig.4",
    "we show the scaling function @xmath123 together with the two asymptotic limits @xmath124 and @xmath126 in the case of sapphire where we have used the value @xmath107 .",
    "the function @xmath123 depends rather smoothly on the actual value of the static dielectric function , provided the value @xmath84 is significantly larger than @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the prediction for the potential given by the static approximation with the exact result evaluated starting from eq.([l ] ) .",
    "the comparison shows that for distances larger than @xmath130 the static approximation is rather accurate .",
    "this explains why the predictions of this approximation for the frequency shifts are also accurate ( see figs [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] ) .    at shorter distances",
    "the static approximation fails and one should instead use the short range description developed in sect.iv .",
    "if @xmath100 the long range description based on the static approximation matches the short range description of sect iv in the casimir - polder regime ( [ l0large ] ) . in this case",
    "the matching procedure completes the determination of the potential at all distances .",
    "if instead the condition @xmath100 is not well satisfied one should calculate explicitly the potential using the general expression ( [ l ] ) and the potential will not exhibit the intermediate casimir - polder behaviour ( [ l0large ] ) .",
    "for example in the case of fig.3 , where the potential is calculated at @xmath92 , the matching between the two curves is not very good and consequently the system never exhibits the casimir - polder behaviour @xcite .",

    "the typical `` two plateau '' behaviour exhibited by @xmath144 in solid dielectrics is the consequence of the concentration of the strength @xmath145 in two distinct regions of frequencies ( see figs [ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] ) .",

    "we have used the values @xmath149 for the harmonic trapping frequency along the @xmath12-th direction and @xmath150 for the @xmath12th radius of the condensate .",
    "these are typical values employed in current experiments with bose - einstein condensates .",

    "these results are promising in view of the possibility of systematic measurements of the interplay between quantum and thermal effects in the generalized van der waals forces .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the predictions for the shifts of the collective frequencies with the results obtainined using the static approximation , holding at large distances ( see sect.v ) . the comparison ( see figs .",

    "the deviations become more important .",
    "one should actually notice that at short distances the width of the condensate plays an important role amplifying the effects of the short range component of the potential .",
    "let us finally discuss the effects of non linearities on the frequency shift .",
    "if the amplitude of the oscillation is not small additional corrections due to the external force should be taken into account ( see sec.ii ) .",

    "for example , by choosing @xmath153 and making the same choices for the other parameters ( @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) , we find that the prediction for the frequency shift ( [ gamma ] ) is increased , in absolute value , by @xmath156 at @xmath157 .",
    "this result shows that for larger choices of the amplitude of the oscillation and for smaller values of @xmath4 the effects of non linearity can become very important . in general they",
    "should be calculated starting directly from eq.([3lev ] ) and ( [ 5lev ] ) .",
    "in this work we have applied lifshitz theory of generalized van der waals interactions to investigate the effect of a substrate on the collective oscillations of a trapped quantum gas .",

    "we have also identified the relevant length scales of the problem and explored the matching conditions for the various approximations . due to the finite size of the condensate the calculation of the frequency shifts",
    "requires a numerical integration , although analytical expressions can be obtained in some limiting cases .",
    "the calculation requires the explicit knowledge of the optical properties of the interacting media and in particular the dielctric function of the susbstrate and the atomic polarizability of the atoms in the condensate .",
    "we have also exploited the effects of nonlinearity and shown that , due to the finite width of the condensate , they can provide large corrections to the frequency shifts and should be consequently taken into account in the comparison with future experiments .",
    "we have finally derived ( see the appendix ) results for the frequency shifts of the radial breathing mode .",
    "our predictions are rather promising and suggest that bose - einstein condensates can become efficient sensors of very weak forces .",
    "in particular the oscillation of the condensate permit to explore the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the relevant region of @xmath1 .",
    "for such distances the relative shifts are predicted to be of the order of @xmath2 and are hence measurable experimentally .",
    "this work was stimulated by insightful discussions with eric cornell .",

    "the radial breathing oscillation in elongated traps is a fundamental mode exhibited by bose - einstein condensates . for an interacting bose - einstein condensate , harmonically trapped in two dimensions ,",
    "this mode exactly occurs at twice the trapping radial frequency ( we assume here symmetric trapping : @xmath158 ) , irrespective of the amplitude of the oscillation , number of atoms and value of the scattering length @xcite . in a 3d configuration",
    "this mode can be realized in the limit of a very elongated axi - symmetric trap ( @xmath159 ) corresponding , in the geometry of fig . 1 , to a condensate very elongated along the direction orthogonal to the figure .",
    "the radial breathing oscillation has been measured with high accuracy in @xcite .",
    "the radial breathing mode can be described by deriving the time - dependent equations for the average square radius @xmath160 within gross - pitaevskii theory @xcite in 2d .",
    "after some straightforward algebra one finds the equation @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the average values of the mean field interaction energy and @xmath163 is the external potential . by introducing the energy per particle @xmath164 , which is conserved in time , and separating in @xmath163 the axi - symmetric harmonic potential @xmath19 from the surface potential @xmath24 , eq.([rr ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath165 in the absence of the surface perturbation ( @xmath23 ) eq.([rr1 ] ) gives oscillating solutions with @xmath166 .",
    "the effect of the perturbation is simply calculated noticing that the unperturbed solution corresponds to a scaling transformation where the density varies as @xmath167 and @xmath26 is the equilibrium density distribution . the time dependent scaling parameter @xmath78 fixes the value of the square radius according to @xmath168 .",
    "using the scaling transformation to evaluate the integrals @xmath169 and @xmath170 one can rewrite eq.([rr1 ] ) as a simple equation for the parameter @xmath78 . in the following",
    "we will be interested in the limit of small amplitude oscillations . by expanding the integrals up to",
    "first order in @xmath171 , one finally obtains the result @xmath172 \\label{b}\\ ] ] for the frequency shift of the radial breathing ( b ) mode , where @xmath173 is the 1d column density ( [ n1 ] ) .",
    "similarly to the case of the shift of the center of mass frequency ( see eq.([gamma ] ) ) , also result ( [ b ] ) is exact up to first order corrections in the perturbation .",
    "in fact the radial scaling ansatz is an exact solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation in 2d .",
    "it is also a good approximation in 3d if the harmonic trap is sufficiently elongated .",
    "result ( [ b ] ) for the radial breathing mode may provide a further tool to investigate the effects of the generalized van der waals force on a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the interaction between macroscopic bodies is not in general the result of a simple summation of the interatomic force .",
    "additivity is guaranteed only in the case of rarefied gases .                            due the external force generated by the wall ,",
    "the center of mass position of the gas at rest does not coincide with the center of the harmonic trap .",
    "this sag effect is however very small and can be safely ignored .    in the case of an ideal degenerate fermi gas confined in a harmonic trap one",
