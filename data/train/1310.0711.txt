    "einstein s theory of gravity , known as general relativity ( gr ) , is a well description of gravitational phenomena at astrophysical and cosmological scales .",
    "the theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements in particular at the solar system scale @xcite .",
    "even if , the local gravity is very well described by gr , there are several observations at astrophysical and cosmological scales for which we need to add extra ingredients in the amount of matter and energy densities of the universe to fit the data .",
    "observations based on supernovae type ia ( sneia ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and other observables , pointed out that the universe is in a period of accelerated expansion favoring the concordance @xmath2cdm model @xcite . in this model , we need to input an extra component , known as dark energy ( de ) , that have the effect of a fluid with a negative pressure , to explain the acceleration of the universe at cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also need to input an extra contribution in the amount of matter , known as dark matter ( dm ) to explain the clustering of the large scale structure .",
    "there are observational evidences point out that the baryonic matter is not enough to explain phenomena at galaxy and cluster scales , like rotation curves , gravitational lensing , cluster profiles and others @xcite .",
    "however , we do not know the nature , at particle level , of this two dark ingredients , even if there are many explanations in literature : quintessence , string theory , holographic principle are examples of de models , while weakly interacting particles ( wimps ) , axions , or massive compact halo objects ( machos ) was been proposed like candidates for dm . as an alternative , instead to introduce two unknown components to explain the dynamics and the evolution of universe at all scales , it is possible change its the geometrical description . in this framework",
    "the extend theories of gravity ( etgs ) are been developed @xcite . by introducing the higher curvature terms in the lagrangian",
    "allow us to reconstruct the de and dm phenomenology at all scales , from planetary dynamics , to flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the velocity dispersion of ellipticals , and from cluster of galaxies until the dynamics of the universe as a whole @xcite .",
    "however , to constraint and validate etgs could be extremely important take also into account the gravitational waves ( gws ) emission . in gr ,",
    "the field equations linearized around a minkowskian metric , show that small perturbations of the metric propagate following a wave equation @xcite .",
    "all astrophysical systems that emit gws are very well described in the framework of gr , where the gravitational interaction is mediate by a massless boson known as graviton .",
    "but , the further degrees of freedom that come out considering etgs lead to have also massive gravitational modes .",
    "in particular , from the power spectrum of weak lensing one can estimate an upper limit of @xmath3 ev for the graviton mass .",
    "then , from clusters of galaxies , it is possible to obtain an upper limit of @xmath4 ev , where @xmath5 is the hubble constant in units of 100kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 .",
    "finally , studying the emission of gws from the binary systems , one can infer an upper limit of graviton mass of @xmath7 ev @xcite .",
    "since the mass of graviton have also effect of the waveform and on the polarization modes , the detection of gws will point out that gr is validated or that it must be extended @xcite . at moment ,",
    "the most important tool , regarding to gws , to constrain both theories of gravity is related to the gravitational emission from binary systems of white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( ns ) and black holes ( bhs ) @xcite .",
    "timing data analysis on the well - known binary pulsar b@xmath8 have confirmed that the energy loss by the system can be explained with the emission of gws .",
    "let s point out that those type of systems , due to the high precision of the mass estimation , and also for the strong field gravity regime in which they are ( psr b@xmath8 or psr j@xmath9 are two examples of system with very precise measuraments ) , represent a very good laboratory to test theories of gravity using post - keplerian parameters @xcite .",
    "let s start to consider a generic class of etgs , called @xmath1-theories , where we replace the einstein - hilbert lagrangian with a more general function of the ricci curvature . for an analytic @xmath1 , it is possible evaluate the first time derivatives of the orbital period for a binary system and , comparing the theoretical estimation with the observed one @xcite , we put bounds on theory parameters and then we compute an upper limit on the graviton mass .    the outline of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "[ due ] we briefly introduce the theoretical framework in which we describe binary systems computing the energy lost through gws emission . in sec .",
    "[ tre ] we summarize how to compute the first time derivative on the orbital period for a binary system in @xmath1-gravity .",
    "furthermore , we test how well the psr @xmath0 can constrain the first time derivative of the orbital period in @xmath1-theories of gravity and , estimate the bounds on graviton mass . finally , in sec .",
    "[ quattro ] we give our conclusions and remarks .",
    "in etgs , the field equations are computed , extending the hilbert - einstein lagrangian with adding of higher - order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "the simplest way is to consider a more general function of the curvature @xmath1 @xcite . in this case , the field equations have the following form ( looking for major details at @xcite ) @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the energy momentum tensor of matter ( @xmath13 is the trace ) , @xmath14 is the coupling , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 indicates the dalembert operator .",
    "the adopted signature is @xmath18 , and we indicate the partial derivative with `` @xmath19 '' and the covariant derivative with respect to the @xmath20 is indicated by `` @xmath21 '' ; all greek indices go from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and latin indices go from @xmath24 to @xmath23 ; @xmath25 is the metric determinant . in a more general approach",
    ", we do nt fix the form of the @xmath1 lagrangian but we just assume that it is taylor expandable in term of the ricci scalar instead of @xmath1 .",
    "all considerations are developed here in metric formalism . from now on we assume physical units @xmath26 . ] in order to compute the minkowskian limit of the theory @xcite ,    @xmath27    in this contest , using theoretical approach given in @xcite , the total average flux of energy emitted in gws has the following form @xmath28 the ratio of @xmath29 and @xmath30 defines an effective mass @xmath31 related to massive modes in gws @xcite . until now",
    ", the only modes of gravitational waves that have been investigated are the massless ones , this exclude the possibility to observe further gravitational waveform coming out from massive terms , although , tests in this direction are already done on stochastic background of gws @xcite .    from the equations of conservation we know that the gravitational radiation , predicted by gr , is proportional to the third derivative of the quadrupole momentum , while the terms due to the monopole and the dipole momentum are zero .",
    "for a discussion on gravitational emission see @xcite .",
    "in @xmath1-gravity we find a different situation .",
    "the fact that we have extended the theory of gravity can be reflected by a mass of graviton not equal to zero . as well known , in etg it is possible to obtain massive gravitons in a natural way @xcite .",
    "the main feature is that higher - order terms or induced scalar fields in the lagrangian , give rise to massless , massive spin-@xmath32 gravitons and massive spin-@xmath22 gravitons .",
    "such gravitational modes results in @xmath33 polarizations , according to the riemann theorem stating that in a given @xmath34-dimensional space , @xmath35 degrees of freedom are possible .",
    "the fact that 6 polarization states emerge is in agreement with the possible allowed polarizations of spin-2 field @xcite .",
    "in fact , the spin degenerations is    * @xmath36 * @xmath37 * @xmath38    the massive spin-@xmath32 gravitational states , usually are ghost particles .",
    "the role of massive gravitons result relevant also in the case which we want define a cutoff mass at tev scale .",
    "this limits allow us , both to circumvent the hierarchy problem that the detection of the higgs boson .",
    "for example , in such a case , the standard model of particles should be confirmed without recurring to perturbative , renormalizable schemes involving new particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , etgs in post newtonian regime gives rise at the yukawa - like correction to the newtonian potential .",
    "these corrections are dependent by a characteristic length of self - gravitating structures that is connected to massive graviton modes .",
    "upper limits on graviton mass come out when ones try to solve the connection between masses and sizes of self - gravitating structures without invoking huge amounts of dm .",
    "following the scheme that is generally used to compute gws emission @xcite , and assuming a keplerian motion of the stars in the binary system , we can define @xmath39 as the pulsar mass , @xmath40 as the companion mass , and @xmath41 as the reduced mass .",
    "the motion is reduced at the @xmath42-plane , so that averaging on the orbital period , @xmath43 , and using the eqs . ,",
    "we get the first time derivative of the orbital period @xcite @xmath44 .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath46 is the newtonian gravitational constant , and the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the ones that we need to constrain .",
    "once we have a theoretical prediction of @xmath49 in @xmath1-theories we can , according with the prescription given in @xcite , compute an upper limit for the graviton mass .",
    "the binary system psr @xmath0 , recently studied by antoniadis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) @xcite , gives a new possibility to understand which range of etg s parameters is allowed .",
    "it is a binary system composed by a pulsar spinning at @xmath50 ms with mass @xmath51 @xmath52 ( @xmath39 ) , and a white dwarf ( wd ) companion with mass @xmath53 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the orbital period of the system is @xmath54 ( days ) , and the eccentricity @xmath55 . for a correct estimation of the observed orbital decay",
    ", it was considered several kinematic effects that have to be subtracted by variation of the orbital period .",
    "the first one is the shklovskii effect @xcite , that is an expression of the effect due to the proper motion of the the binary system .",
    "its estimation for this system is @xmath56    another effect is due to the difference of galactic accelerations between the binary system and the solar system @xmath57    the last term is due to a possible variation of the gravitational constant @xmath58 : @xmath59    finally , the observed value of the first time derivative of the orbital period is @xmath60 .",
    "all those terms are quoted in @xcite .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the etgs are not ruled out when the orbital parameters of the binary systems are very well estimated , and the range of the @xmath1 parameters is @xmath61 .    .",
    "we use the following notation : the black line shows the behavior of the gr prediction for the first derivative of the orbital period for a binary system ; the red line represents the observed orbital period variation @xmath62 and its errors , in particular the dashed lines show the experimental error on the observation ; the blue line shows the @xmath1-theory prediction as computed in eq . . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we report the result of our numerical analysis on the binary system psr @xmath0 .",
    "we use the following notation : the black line shows the behavior of the gr prediction for the first derivative of the orbital period for the binary system ; the red line represents the observed orbital period variation @xmath62 and its errors , in particular the dashed lines show the experimental error on the observation ; the blue line shows the @xmath1-theory prediction as computed in eq . .",
    "moreover , it is possible to see from fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] that the gr value of @xmath63 is recovered for @xmath64 ( diamond black ) .",
    "the value of the second derivative of the gravitational lagrangian for which etgs are able to explain the observed period variation is @xmath65 ( blue triangle ) .",
    "this value is comparable with the range given in @xcite . using the range of the @xmath1 parameters allowed",
    ", we are interested to compute an upper limit for the graviton mass to understand if this agree with other estimation . according with the prescription given in @xcite we get the following upper limit @xmath66 that is comparable with the constrain coming out from @xmath67 , and is also comparable with the one obtained analyzing the brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "several shortcomings coming out from astrophysical and cosmological observations , and theoretical problem related to have a full quantum description of space - time , suggest to extend the gr to overcome them .",
    "approaches based on extension or corrections of gr are in agreement with several observables at astrophysical and cosmological scales , explaining the dynamical effect related to the dm , and also the observed acceleration of the universe .    in the post - minkowskian limit of etgs provide an accurate description of the problem of gravitational radiation . in this approach",
    ", we found extra polarizations modes of the gws signal with respect to the plus ( + ) and cross ( @xmath68 ) polarizations predicted by gr @xcite .",
    "indeed , the theories allows massive and ghosts modes that in principle could be detected using ground - based interferometric detectors , like virgo and ligo @xcite , and the future space interferometric detector , lisa @xcite including the additional polarization modes .",
    "furthermore , results coming out from the timing array analysis on binary pulsars systems like psr @xmath67 and from other binary systems , can provide a very useful tool to investigate the the viability of etgs , like the @xmath1-gravity theories .",
    "for that purpose , it is possible to develop a quadrupolar formalism of the gravitaional radiation using analytic @xmath1-models , and showing that expertimental bounds on the first derivative of the orbital period of the binary system , that are provided by psr @xmath0 , do not ruled out the @xmath1-gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the upper limit on graviton mass , that we have computed basing our calculation on the experimental constraint of the orbital parameters , and on the theoretical prediction of the @xmath1 model , is comparable with the other constrains that come from clusters , galaxies etc @xcite .",
    "this result , together with other results from observations in the solar system and cosmology , indicates that the study and the possible detection of massive modes of gws could be the real discriminating between the theory of gr and its extensions .",
