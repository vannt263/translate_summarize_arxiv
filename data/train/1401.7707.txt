    "rckner @xcite that any stationary measure @xmath17 of ( [ fp ] ) must admit a positive density @xmath26 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide several useful measure estimates , in an exterior domain @xmath27 for a compact subset @xmath28 of @xmath5 , of regular stationary measures of ( [ fp ] ) with densities lying in @xmath29 .",

    "in fact , the integral identity plays a similar role as the pohozaev identity does to semilinear elliptic equations .",
    "it is because of this identity that our essential measure estimates can be made regardless of the positive definiteness of @xmath32 in @xmath5 .",
    "our measure estimates in an exterior domain will be made with respect to diffusions and derivatives of a lyapunov - like or an anti - lyapunov - like function which is primarily a compact function in the domain .",
