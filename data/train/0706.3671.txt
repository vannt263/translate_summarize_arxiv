    "<S> sufficiently large cut - off parameter the brunet - derrida formula lies outside the allowed band determined from the bounds . if nonlinearities are neglected the upper and lower bounds coincide and are the exact linear speed for all values of the cut - off parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the reaction diffusion equation @xmath0 provides a simple description of phenomena in fields such as population dynamics , chemical reactions , flame propagation , fluids , qcd , among others @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is one of the simplest models which shows how a small perturbation to an unstable state develops into a moving front joining a stable to an unstable state . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction term @xmath1 satisfies different conditions depending on the physical problem of interest . </S>",
    "<S> one of the first , and most studied cases , is the fisher reaction term @xmath2 for which the asymptotic speed of the propagating front is @xmath3 , a value determined from linear considerations . </S>",
    "<S> a more general case was studied by kolmogorov , petrovskii and piscounov ( kpp)@xcite who showed that for all reaction terms which satisfy the kpp condition @xmath4 the asymptotic speed of the front joining the stable @xmath5 point to the unstable @xmath6 point is given by @xmath7 these fronts are called pulled since it is the leading edge of the front which determines the velocity of propagation . in the rest of this work </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of localized initial conditions for general reaction terms , and rigorous properties of the fronts were studied by aronson and weinberger @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic speed of the front for all reaction terms can be found from the integral variational principle @xcite @xmath9 where the supremum is taken over all positive monotonic decreasing functions @xmath10 for which the integrals exist and where @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the supremum is always attained for reaction terms which are not pulled .    </S>",
    "<S> two effects not included in the classical reaction diffusion equation ( [ rd ] ) , are the effect of noise and the effect of a finite number @xmath12 of diffusive particles . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown by brunet and derrida that such effects can be simulated by introducing a cut - off in the reaction term . in the case of noise </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off parameter measures the amplitude of the noise while in the case of finite number of @xmath12 diffusing particles the cut - off parameter @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> there is substantial numerical evidence that introducing a cut - off in the reaction terms reproduces accurately the effect of noise and finiteness in the number of diffusing particles @xcite .    by means of an asymptotic matching brunet and derrida showed that for a reaction term @xmath14 a small cut - off changes the speed of the front to @xmath15 in recent work it has been show that the brunet - derrida formula for the speed is correct to @xmath16@xmath17 for a wider class of reaction terms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this work is to show that for reaction terms of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 satisfies the kpp condition eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kppcondition ] ) and @xmath20 is the step function , the speed @xmath21 of the front with the cutoff satisfies @xmath22 with @xmath23    we see that for @xmath24 , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath26 depends on the nonlinear terms of the reaction function . for small @xmath27 the series expansion of the upper bound @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath29 the contribution of the nonlinearities , contained in the term @xmath26 , appears at @xmath16@xmath17 , so that the leading order terms in the expansion of the upper and lower bounds give the brunet - derrida formula . </S>",
    "<S> if nonlinearities are neglected the value @xmath30 is the analog of the kpp value @xmath3 for reaction terms which satisfy the kpp condition , but with a cutoff .    in what follows we derive the bounds and apply them to the fisher reaction term @xcite @xmath31 and to the reaction term studied by brunet and derrida @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the main tool to obtain the bounds is the variational principle for the speed .    as shown in previous work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we may perform the change variables @xmath33 where @xmath34 in eq.([vp1 ] ) and write the variational expression for the speed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary parameter , @xmath37 and the supremum is taken over positive increasing functions @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , @xmath40 and for which all the integrals in ( [ newvp ] ) are finite . </S>",

    "<S> we find @xmath45 where @xmath46    assume now that @xmath1 satisfies the kpp criterion eq.([kppcondition ] ) . </S>",
