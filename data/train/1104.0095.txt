    "in photoproduction processes at hera , a quasi - real photon emitted from the incoming electron ( or positron ) collides with a parton from the incoming proton . within qcd",
    "the photoproduction is classified into two categories : ( i ) direct processes , in which the photon acts as a point - like particle in the hard scattering , and ( ii ) resolved processes , in which the photon acts as a source of incoming partons which participate in the hard interaction .",
    "the two classes result directly from the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculation of the photoproduction cross sections , since due to the initial photon s virtuality @xmath0 , the direct processes in nlo have an initial - state singularity which must be absorbed into the photon parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , on which the resolved cross section depends .",
    "measurements of cross sections for the production of jets with high transverse energy are sensitive to the pdfs of both the proton and the photon .",
    "the proton pdfs are known from the extensive global analyses of the cteq @xcite and mstw @xcite groups .",
    "the photon pdfs are essentially based only on data for @xmath1 .",
    "of course the proton pdfs are much better known than the photon pdfs .",
    "the three newest photon pdfs , cornet et al .",
    "( cjk ) @xcite , aurenche et al .",
    "( afg04 ) @xcite and slominski et al .",
    "( sal ) @xcite , use all available data of @xmath2 from the lep experiments .",
    "the older parameterizations of glck et al .",
    "( grv ) @xcite and aurenche et al .",
    "( afg ) @xcite could use only the lower energy measurements of @xmath2 known at the time of their construction and are , of course , less reliable than the more recent sets .    in 2007 the zeus collaboration at hera presented their data on high-@xmath3 dijet photoproduction @xcite and compared them to nlo qcd calculations with the aim to provide constraints on the pdfs of the photon .",
    "the comparison was done to the five photon pdfs mentioned above .",
    "the differences obtained with these pdfs were generally less than @xmath4 for the afg , afg04 , sal and grv sets .",
    "the predictions based on cjk set was up to @xmath5 higher than those based on the other four .",
    "these differences occurred predominantly in the small @xmath6 region and for low @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise the agreement with all five pdfs was very satisfactory .",
    "the photon pdfs have three essentially different components : light quarks , heavy quarks ( charm and/or bottom ) and the gluon .",
    "the best known of these three components is that of the light quarks , while much less is known about the charm and bottom quark contents .",
    "however , it is possible to separate the heavy quarks , for example the charm quark pdf in the photon , from the light quark ones by measuring the dijet production cross sections with at least one charm quark jet .",
    "such measurements have been done in the past by the zeus collaboration at hera @xcite . in these measurements",
    "the selection of the charm jet occurs by measuring the differential cross section for the production of a @xmath7-meson associated with the dijet system .",
    "so far , these data have been compared only with nlo predictions based on the massive charm scheme or fixed - flavour number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite , in which an explicit charm component of the photon pdfs in the resolved cross section does not occur . in this scheme",
    "such a contribution is approximated with the nlo partonic cross section , convolved with the pdfs of incoming light quarks and the gluon .",
    "on the other hand in the comparison of the inclusive dijet photoproduction data ( see for example @xcite and the earlier work quoted there ) with the nlo calculations , the charm quark is always considered massless with the consequence that in the resolved contribution the charm component of the photon pdfs is present .",
    "this approach would be justified when the cross section with at least one charm could satisfactorily be described in the massless charm scheme .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to present results of nlo calculations in the massless charm scheme for dijet cross sections with at least one charm jet and to find out whether they can describe satisfactorily the measured cross sections from zeus @xcite .",
    "there , a similar comparison had been performed , which was , however , based only on leading order monte carlo simulations .",
    "of course such a comparison depends on the charm pdf of the photon .",
    "the treatment of the charm quark being massless is justified as long as the @xmath3 of the produced jets is large enough , i.e. @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the charm quark mass .",
    "the zeus data reported in @xcite are particularly suitable for our purpose , since by measuring the @xmath6 distribution @xmath10 and the angular distribution of the outgoing jets for large and small @xmath6 , i.e. for the dominant subprocesses , direct and resolved , the data are most sensitively dependent on the charm content of the photon pdf .",
    "in section 2 we shall describe the theoretical framework and outline the kinematical restrictions based on the experimental cuts applied in @xcite .",
    "section 3 contains our results and the discussion of the comparison with the data @xcite for the default choice of the grv photon pdf . in section 4",
    "we compare different photon pdfs for a scale characteristic for charm jet production , and in section 5 we give cross sections obtained with three different photon pdfs , grv , afg04 and cjk .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "for our calculations we rely on our work on dijet production in the reaction @xmath11 @xcite in which we have calculated the cross section for inclusive one - jet and two - jet production up to nlo for both the direct and the resolved contribution ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the predictions of this work have been tested by many experimental studies of the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera . to obtain the cross section with at least one charm jet in the final state we calculated the difference of the cross section with @xmath12 quark flavours and the cross section with @xmath13 quark flavours in the initial state . in the resolved part",
    "this difference contains only the contribution of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the initial state , where @xmath16 is a light quark ( or antiquark ) . in the @xmath15 contribution it contains also the contribution from @xmath17 and @xmath18 in leading order ( lo ) and the corresponding contributions in nlo .",
    "since these contributions originate from the charm pdfs of the photon and the proton , their magnitude is expected to be small . in lo their contribution to the cross section integrated over the whole phase region as in the zeus experiment , to be specified below , amounts to @xmath19 .",
    "we expect a similar amount from the nlo contributions .",
    "as input we employ the nlo grv 92 photon pdfs @xcite , converted to the @xmath20 scheme , and the nlo cteq6 m proton pdfs @xcite .",
    "the strong - coupling constant @xmath21 is evaluated from the two - loop formula @xcite with @xmath22 active quark flavours .",
    "both in the @xmath13 calculation and in the difference of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 cross sections , @xmath12 is used in the @xmath23 formula .",
    "the asymptotic scale parameter is @xmath24 gev corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "we choose the renormalization scale @xmath26 and the factorization scale @xmath27 of the initial state to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the average transverse energy of the two ( or three)final - state partons constituting the two jets . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are dimensionless scale factors , which are varied about their default values @xmath33 as described later . the experimental data presented in @xcite were taken with electrons or positrons of energy @xmath34 gev and protons with energy @xmath35 gev ( 1996 - 1997 ) or @xmath36 gev ( 1998 - 2000 ) corresponding to integrated luminosities of @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 and to centre - of mass energies of @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 gev , respectively . in our calculations",
    "we took the kinematic conditions of the 1998 - 2000 period due to its larger luminosity .    in the experiment ,",
    "the photon virtuality @xmath42 was restricted to be below @xmath43 .",
    "the photon - proton centre - of mass energy was lying in the range @xmath44 gev .",
    "jets were reconstructed with the @xmath45-cluster algorithm in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode @xcite .",
    "the events were required to have at least two jets with pseudorapidity @xmath46 and transverse energy @xmath47 gev .",
    "with the two energetic jets a @xmath7-meson is observed .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath7 meson is required to have @xmath48 gev and pseudorapitity @xmath49 .    in @xcite",
    ", the following three jet variables were chosen in the analysis : @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in order to select contributions to the cross section enriched by direct and resolved photon events ,",
    "the variable @xmath50 defined by @xmath53 was determined . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the initial photon energy , and the sum in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is over the two jets with the two highest @xmath55 . due to the restriction to two jets",
    ", @xmath50 does not measure the full @xmath6 , whence the superscript `` obs '' . with @xmath56 samples enriched in direct ( resolved ) photon processes are selected .",
    "the complementary variable on the proton side is @xmath57 which is the fraction of the proton s momentum contributing to the production of the two jets with highest @xmath55 .",
    "the third variable is @xmath52 , where @xmath58 is the dijet scattering angle .",
    "it is given by @xmath59 in order to enhance the characteristic features of the direct versus the resolved contributions in the @xmath52 distribution , a cut on the invariant mass @xmath60 is applied : @xmath61 gev . for the case in which the two jets are back - to - back in the transverse plane with equal transverse @xmath3 ,",
    "the dijet invariant mass is @xmath62 in order to achieve high values of @xmath63 without bias from the @xmath55 cut , @xmath60 must be large enough . in our calculations",
    "we shall study only the distribution in the absolute value of @xmath52 , which does not depend on which is jet number 1 and jet number 2 .",
    "in the data analysis of @xcite a cut on the average longitudinal boost @xmath64 of @xmath65 is applied .",
    "this selection limits @xmath66 to @xmath67 , removes the bias caused by the explicit cut on @xmath66 and reduces the bias caused by the cut on @xmath49 .",
    "according to @xcite the residual distortion due to @xmath68 cut is small and confined to the extreme bins of the @xmath52 distribution . with all these cuts",
    "it is achieved that the measured distributions test to a large extent the dynamics of the hard scattering processes .",
    "all these experimented cuts on the rapidities @xmath66 , transverse energies @xmath55 and the invariant mass @xmath60 are also applied to the calculation of the cross sections in nlo .",
    "however , the @xmath69 gev cut to both jets can not be applied , since it leads to infrared sensitive cross sections @xcite .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 gev .",
    "unfortunately , in the experimental data analysis such an asymmetric cut has not been applied , although in an earlier @xcite and the later publication @xcite such asymmetric cuts were used to make the comparison with the results of the massive nlo calculations possible . since with our choice",
    "the difference between the two cut values is small , @xmath72 gev , we expect that it has little influence on the measured cross sections .",
    "the observed @xmath7 in every event triggers the production of at least one charm jet .",
    "the fraction of charm quarks fragmenting into a @xmath7 meson was assumed to be @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we multiply the calculated charm jet cross section with this branching ratio when we compare to the experimental data .",
    "actually the measured cross sections are the luminosity - weighted average of the cross sections at the two proton energies @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 gev . in our calculation we neglect this averaging and give only results for @xmath36 gev .",
    "in connection with inclusive dijet events obtained for our calculation with @xmath12 initial quark flavours , it is of interest to know the contributions of charm dijet events .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the ratio of the charm jet dijet cross section to the inclusive dijet cross section . this ratio is shown as a function of @xmath51 ( denoted as @xmath74 in the figure ) in fig .",
    "the ratio is of order @xmath75 and almost independent of @xmath74 .",
    "if the direct process dominated , this ratio would be 2/5 as follows from the sum of the squared charges of the contributing quarks . the smaller ratio in fig .",
    "1 is due to the contribution of the resolved process .",
    "the differential charm dijet cross section as a function of @xmath50 ( denoted @xmath6 in the figure ) , which is sensitively dependent on the resolved process for @xmath76 , is plotted in fig . 2 and compared with the data from @xcite . to the theoretical nlo predictions we have applied hadronization corrections , which have been given in @xcite .",
    "in each bin the nlo cross section was multiplied by the correction factor @xmath77 , which is the ratio of the monte carlo ( mc ) cross sections after and before the hadronization process . in addition , we have evaluated the uncertainties in the nlo calculations , shown as the shaded area , originating from the variation of @xmath26 and @xmath27 with the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the range @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the maximum ( minimum ) cross section is obtained for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this variation of scales is also used in connection with the @xmath51 and @xmath63 distributions shown below .",
    "the low-@xmath6 tail of the nlo cross section is below the data . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the data are well described by the nlo prediction . in the region",
    "@xmath83 we would have expected a better agreement with the data since in this region the higher order terms to the cross section contribute together with the resolved contribution . however , the nlo direct terms give a negative contribution in this region which apparently is not compensated enough by the resolved contribution . from this comparison",
    "we can conclude already that the charm part of the photon pdf as contained in the grv higher order set @xcite is not large enough in the low @xmath6 region .",
    "we shall come back to this point when we discuss other parameterizations of the charm pdfs of the photon .",
    "the differential cross section as a function of @xmath51 is compared in fig .",
    "3 with our nlo calculation .",
    "the nlo prediction is in good agreement with the data .",
    "all data points lie inside the theoretical error range , even the point in the largest @xmath51 bin agrees inside the experimental error . actually for the default scales @xmath84 the theoretical prediction agree with the data inside the experimental error .",
    "it is of interest to know how much of the cross section @xmath85 originates from the direct or resolved part of the cross section .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where we have plotted the resolved part of @xmath86 and compared with the full @xmath86 and the experimental data of @xcite .",
    "we see that the resolved part has almost the same shape and its strength is between @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the total .",
    "the direct-@xmath89 @xmath74 distribution , i.e. for @xmath90 , is between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , depending on @xmath74 .",
    "thus the resolved-@xmath89 contribution of @xmath86 , i.e. for @xmath93 , is very small . due to the lack of data for it in @xcite ,",
    "a direct comparison is not possible .    in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 we compare the nlo results for the charm dijet angular distribution to the zeus data @xcite as a function of @xmath63 . for the high-@xmath6 region , @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , the nlo result is in reasonable agreement with the data , although not perfect even inside the theoretical error bars , which are rather small for the lower @xmath63 bins . for low @xmath6 , @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , the nlo prediction is much lower than the data , except for the two lowest @xmath63 bins .",
    "this is related to the bad agreement between the prediction and the data for the @xmath10 cross section in the region @xmath96 , where apparently contributions from the resolved part are missing .",
    "actually the experimental data agree much better with the lo prediction using the same pdfs for the proton and the photon as in the nlo calculation .",
    "the lo cross section for @xmath97 is , depending on the @xmath63 bin , up to a factor between @xmath98 and @xmath99 larger than the nlo result .",
    "in total we can state that our results with the grv photon pdfs @xcite agree reasonably well with the data of @xcite in the large-@xmath6 region , but much less so in the small-@xmath6 region , where the calculated cross sections are too small as compared to the experimental cross sections of @xcite .",
    "this is quite similar as the results obtained in @xcite in the ffn scheme . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that replacing the massless charm cross section in the calculations for the inclusive dijet photoproduction cross section by the ffns result would not change the result significantly . in the ffns calculations the resolved contribution depends only on the photon pdfs of the light quarks and the gluon .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the ffns result will change much by choosing other photon pdfs , also in particular since in the ffn scheme the resolved contribution is less than in the massless charm scheme .",
    "therefore , a change of the theoretical result in the small-@xmath6 region can be achieved only in the massless charm scheme by changing in the resolved contribution the charm part of the photon pdfs . to see whether this is possible we shall investigate in the follwing the theoretical cross sections in the small-@xmath6 region with the more modern photon pdfs afg04 @xcite and cjk @xcite with the hope that the cross section in this region will be larger .",
    "before we present our results , we shall take a look at the differences between the charm densities of the various photon pdfs as a function of the scaled momentum variable @xmath100 for the scale @xmath101 , which is the smallest squared scale occurring in our cross section calculations .",
    "the four charm desities of the photon are plotted in fig .",
    "7 as a function of @xmath100 in the interval @xmath102 . to make the comparison easier ,",
    "the photon pdfs are shown in the @xmath103 scheme in order to regularize the singularity at @xmath104 .",
    "shown is the grv charm density @xcite , which is already given in the @xmath103 scheme .",
    "an updated version of this is the pdf grs @xcite , but this does not include a charm density .",
    "this is explicitly described by the lo ffns contribution in @xmath2 , which is not suitable for our purpose .",
    "the next one is afg04 @xcite , which is constructed in the @xmath20 scheme and therefore transformed to the @xmath103 scheme by adding the term @xmath105 @xcite .    for this density @xmath106 gev",
    ", so at @xmath107 gev@xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "but this is not reflected in the charm pdf , since it is constructed in the massless flavour changing scheme with @xmath110 .",
    "this charm density changes very little as compared to the older version afg @xcite .",
    "it is considerably larger ( smaller ) than the grv version at @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the cjk charm density is alo presented in the dis@xmath113 scheme @xcite . here",
    "@xmath114 gev , so at @xmath107 gev@xmath108 , @xmath115 .",
    "this is clearly visible in the charm pdf , since the finite charm mass is kept .",
    "it is considerably larger ( smaller ) than grv at @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the sal charm density is also obtained in the dis@xmath113 scheme @xcite . here",
    "@xmath118 gev is used , but it enters only at threshold in the @xmath23 evolution .",
    "it is very similar to grv , but it is slightly lower over the full range of @xmath100 , in particular at small @xmath119 . because of the similarity to our default choice grv , we do not expect important changes in the dijet cross sections and therefore do not consider it further .    from this comparison , we expect that the afg04 and even more so the cjk charm photon pdfs should yield larger cross sections than the grv version in the small-@xmath50 region and somewhat smaller coss sections in the large-@xmath50 region .",
    "how the cross sections for these three photon pdfs , grv , afg04 and cjk , compare with each other and with the zeus data will be shown in the next section .",
    "first we show the cross section @xmath10 in fig . 8 for the three photon pdfs grv , afg04 and cjk , where we expect better agreement with the experimental cross section for @xmath96 with cjk .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "whereas in the two largest @xmath6-bins there is little change between grv and cjk , the rest of the @xmath6-bins have larger cross sections for cjk and agree now much better with the zeus data . for completeness",
    "we also show the equivalent comparison for the cross section @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "all three photon pdfs yield almost the same cross section and agree equally well with the data .",
    "a similar pattern occurs for the @xmath63 distribution in the large @xmath6 region ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the cross section for the three pdfs are very similar and agree equally with the zeus data . only at @xmath121 the cross setion for afg04 and cjk is somewhat reduced ( see fig .",
    "the critical cross section is @xmath97 for @xmath96 shown in fig .",
    "the agreement with the data was bad for grv , in particular for @xmath122 . in this region",
    "the data agree now better with the cjk prediction as expected , although not perfectly .",
    "the cross section for cjk is more than a factor of two larger than for grv in this region of @xmath63 .",
    "the result for afg04 is very similar to that of grv and does not lead to any improvement compared to the experimental results .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the dijet photoproduction cross section as a function of @xmath123 has been measured by the zeus collaboration also for all flavours @xcite , and the comparison with nlo calculations showed in general good agreement for all tested photon pdfs . however , the nlo predictions obtained with the cjk photon pdfs were larger than the data at low @xmath124 and @xmath125 gev , while they agreed better with the data than those obtained with the other pdfs in the second and larger @xmath3-bins",
    ". it may thus be necessary to compensate the higher charm - quark density favoured by the charm dijet analysis with a smaller up - quark density at lower values @xmath123 ( cf .  also fig .",
    "14 in @xcite ) . here",
    "one must keep in mind that the full dijet analysis has been performed at larger values of @xmath126 gev ( or @xmath127 ) than the charm dijet analysis , where @xmath128 gev ( see also fig .",
    "15 in @xcite for the evolution of the cjk charm density with @xmath42 ) .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the contribution of charm quarks to photoproduced dijets at hera is substantial with charm quarks ( or mesons ) accounting for about one - third of all photoproduced dijets .",
    "this is in good agreement with the naive estimate of 2/5 from the sum of the squared quark charges coupling to the photon and offers the possibility to constrain the charm quark density in the photon .    to this end , we have computed the charm dijet photoproduction cross section at nlo of qcd in the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme , i.e.  with active charm quarks in the proton and photon .",
    "this approach is justified by the fact that at large values of transverse energy the charm quark mass may safely be neglected , so that the contributions of collinear charm quark excitations may be resummed into parton densities in the photon and proton .",
    "our theoretical results were compared to recent measurements from the zeus experiment at hera .",
    "the distributions in the photon and proton momentum fractions and the dijet scattering angle agreed well with the data , in particular for large momentum fractions of the partons in the photon , where direct photon processes dominate . at low momentum fractions ,",
    "the predictions were quite sensitive to the charm content in the photon .",
    "we demonstrated that the experimental data favoured parameterizations , like the one by the cjk collaboration , with a substantial charm quark density .",
    "since the total dijet cross section is overestimated by this parameterization , at least at low momentum fractions of the partons in the photon , it may , however , be necessary to compensate the higher charm - quark density with a smaller up - quark density",
    ". the logical next step would thus be to perform a global analysis of @xmath129 and dijet photoproduction data to better constrain the different flavours in the photon pdfs .    00 h .-",
