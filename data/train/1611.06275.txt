    "white dwarfs ( wd ) are the endpoint of stellar evolution for stars lighter than 8  10  @xmath7 @xcite , or greater than 97% of galactic stars . as the direct remnants of earlier star formation , wds are an important tool in studying the evolution of our galaxy .",
    "the basic observable when studying star formation history with wds is the distribution of wds in luminosity , or the luminosity function ( lf ; see @xcite for a recent review of both the observational and theoretical work on the white dwarf luminosity function ) . in particular , for a given stellar population",
    ", the location and shape of the peak and turnover in the lf at the faint end can be used to constrain the age of that population @xcite .",
    "the bright end ( @xmath8 ) of the white dwarf luminosity function ( wdlf ) is populated by hot wds whose optical colors are distinct from other stellar populations , allowing clean samples of hot wds to be found based on photometry alone .",
    "thus , even the earliest lfs for hot wds contained hundreds of stars , including those produced from the palomar - green @xcite and kiso @xcite ultraviolet excess surveys .",
    "lfs generated from modern large - scale spectroscopic surveys have been based on samples of thousands of hot wds , including those from the sdss @xcite and the anglo - australian 2df qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "thus , the bright end of the wdlf is defined with high statistical significance .",
    "the majority of wds however are fainter , with colors indistinguishable from subdwarfs , making their selection using photometry alone impossible . the first study to resolve the peak of the lf and obtain samples of wds fainter than the turnover was @xcite , based on a sample of 43 cool wds selected from the luyten half - second catalog @xcite to have @xmath9 ( and later reanalyzed with additional spectroscopy and photometry by @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent proper - motion based studies had similar sample sizes @xcite .",
    "the first major increase in sample size was that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h06 ) , which used sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) photometry and proper motions from a combined catalog @xcite of sdss and usno - b @xcite astrometry to generate a sample of 6000 reduced - proper - motion selected wds .",
    "* hereafter rh11 ) similarly used reduced proper motions to select 10,000 wds from the supercosmos sky survey @xcite .",
    "both surveys provide a galactic disk wdlf with high statistical significance in the luminosity range @xmath10 , and clearly define the peak of the disk wdlf at @xmath11 .",
    "however , neither provides many stars fainter than the turnover , with only 4 stars in h06 and 48 in rh11 with @xmath12 ( in their @xmath13 samples ) .",
    "both surveys are dependent on the classic schmidt telescope photographic surveys for one or both epochs , and thus are limited to the depth of the photographic surveys , @xmath14 .",
    "a hydrogen atmosphere wd one magnitude fainter than the turnover has @xmath15 , which at a faint limit of @xmath14 corresponds to only 50  pc .",
    "thus the small surveyed volume severely limits the number of wds detectable past the turnover .",
    "rh11 detected more such wds as their sky coverage is nearly six times as great as that for h06 ( roughly 30,000  deg@xmath16 for rh11 versus 5300  deg@xmath16 for h06 ) . both papers",
    "also present a lf for clean samples of galactic halo wds , defined kinematically by requiring @xmath17 .",
    "h06 detect only 18 such halo wds , while rh11 with their greater sky coverage detect 93 .",
    "the sample sizes of halo wds are limited by the much smaller density of halo stars within the solar neighborhood .",
    "the rh11 sample is by far the largest sample of halo wd candidates to date .",
    "note that , unlike many of the other samples discussed above , most of the wds in the h06 and rh11 samples lack spectroscopic confirmation , though contamination by non - wds is thought to be both understood and small @xcite .",
    "recent work has concentrated on producing nearly complete samples of wds in the local volume .",
    "lfs have been produced using wds within 20 @xcite , 25 @xcite , and 40  pc @xcite of the sun , with sample sizes of 147 , 232 , and 501 wds , respectively .",
    "the 40  pc lf has 22 stars fainter than the turnover ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "no halo wds were found in any of the samples , with three possible candidates in the 40  pc sample .    in order to address the paucity of both disk wds fainter than the turnover and halo wds in our earlier work in h06 , in 2009 we started a survey to re - observe parts of the sdss imaging footprint , obtaining",
    "a second epoch which , combined with sdss astrometry , would yield proper motions roughly 2 magnitudes fainter than that obtainable using the schmidt surveys @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a catalog of wd candidates selected from that survey , and the resultant disk and halo wdlfs .",
    "individual objects with additional follow - up observations have been presented in previous papers @xcite .",

    "section  [ section - luminosity - function ] presents the luminosity functions , section  [ section - catalog ] presents the catalog , and section  [ section - summary ] summarizes our results .",
    "the wd sample is drawn from the deep proper motion survey of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter m2014 ) .",
    "this paper uses only the data considered `` good '' from the survey , which includes 1089 square degrees of sky observed with the 90prime prime focus wide - field imager on the steward observatory bok 90 inch telescope @xcite , and an additional 1521 square degrees of sky observed with the array camera on the u. s. naval observatory , flagstaff station , 1.3 meter telescope .",
    "the bok and 1.3 m data are 90% complete to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we define the term _ field _ throughout this paper as the area of sky covered by a single ccd within a single observation in m2014 .",
    "data quality naturally varies between individual observations , due to differences in seeing , image depth , etc .",
    "data quality can also vary between different fields within individual observations , primarily due to the varying psf across the large field - of - views of the bok and 1.3 m telescopes ; collimating fast , large field - of - view telescopes is not easy , and both telescopes suffered from collimation issues at times during the survey .",
    "we thus treat each field as a separate survey , in terms of rejecting bad data , modeling the data quality , and selecting candidate wds .",
    "each field images an area of sky covered by multiple sdss scans , which typically were taken on different nights .",
    "thus , the epoch difference between the bok/1.3 m and sdss data can vary for different objects within a field .",
    "we limit our survey to fields whose minimum epoch difference is at least 3.5 years , so as to provide well measured proper motions ; this reduces the area coverage by 4.2% .",
    "a number of fields in both the bok and 1.3 m surveys are suspect , for a variety of reasons : they appear not to obtain the depth estimated in the catalog ; the image quality is poor , primarily due to poor collimation ; or they have a much larger number of candidate high proper motion candidate stars than expected , indicating problems with either the image quality or astrometric calibration .",
    "these fields are excluded from the sample , and are listed in table  [ table - excluded - fields ] ; this reduces the area coverage by a further 0.8% .",
    "image quality in the corners of the array camera on the 1.3 m begins to deteriorate , and we find a higher incidence of false proper motions in the catalog in the corners based on visual inspection .",
    "thus we include only objects detected within a 0.68 degree radius of the camera center for the 1.3 m data , reducing the sky coverage of the 1.3 m data by 12.0% .",
    "we further exclude areas of sky affected by bright stars , as specified using the bright star masks given in m2014 ( which are derived from those of @xcite ) , for an additional reduction in area coverage of 2.0% .",
    "the sky coverage of the final sample includes 980 square degrees from the bok survey , and 1276 square degrees from the 1.3 m survey .",

    "this defines the complete stellar sample from which the wd candidates will be selected .",
    "while the proper motion of each candidate wd will be visually verified , we wish to define a relatively clean sample of stars with reliably measured proper motions via a set of cuts which reject well - defined regions of parameter space with a high contamination rate of false high proper motion objects . to this end",

    "the daophot centroids are used to measure the proper motion , and thus the proper motion for objects whose psf fits failed to converge ( @xmath22 ) are unreliable .",

    "the disk wdlf has been presented , with statistically significant samples of stars cooler than the lf turnover , a region of the lf particularly important in applying the wdlf to the determination of the age of the disk .",
    "that determination remains hampered by the unknown atmospheric composition and masses of most stars fainter than the turnover , and likely wo nt be resolved until parallaxes for significant samples of faint wds are available .",
    "the halo wdlf has also been presented , based on a sample of 135 stars .",
    "both the disk and halo wdlfs have been compared to those of h06 and rh11 , which are similar in technique , the portion of the lf studied , and sample size .",
    "the shape of the disk lf is in broad agreement with both h06 and rh11 brighter than the turnover .",
    "we find a higher density of wds fainter than the turnover , though only at the 2  3 @xmath25 level .",
    "our halo wdlf agrees with the h06 lf within their errors , but the rh11 lf gives densities about 40% larger ( after scaling to match our disk lfs ) .",

    "while these are the largest samples to date of disk wds fainter than the turnover , as well as of halo wds , the imminent release of the the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 3pi survey data will allow for both deeper and much larger samples , with improved photometric accuracy that should help in distinguishing between hydrogen and helium atmosphere wds for those wds cooler than the turnover in the disk lf . in about a year",
