    "@xcite reported exact analytical solutions for the magnetic - field and sheet - current - density profiles for two current - carrying parallel coplanar thin - film superconducting strips in a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "included were calculations for ( a ) the inductance per unit length when the two strips carry equal and opposite currents , ( b ) the zero - flux - quantum state when no net magnetic flux threads between the strips in a perpendicular applied field @xmath7 , and ( c ) the focusing of magnetic flux between the two strips in a field @xmath7 when each strip carries no net current .",
    "these problems are of relevance to the design of superconducting thin - film devices , especially superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) .    of interest",
    "is the focusing of magnetic flux into the central hole in washer - type  @xcite squids and , in particular , the question of how much flux @xmath8 goes into the hole when the squid is in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath9 and no net current circulates around the hole .",
    "the flux - focusing problem was examined by ketchen et al .",
    ",  @xcite who expressed @xmath8 in terms of an effective pickup area of the hole , @xmath10 , which in general is larger than the actual area of the hole , @xmath11 , but less than the area occupied by the washer , @xmath12 .",
    "accounting only for azimuthal currents , they considered a washer of circular geometry ( an annular ring ) and derived a simple theoretical expression for the effective area , @xmath13 , the theoretical approximations used being valid only for @xmath14 .",
    "experiments on a series of square washers with @xmath15 up to @xmath16 yielded results in excellent qualitative agreement with the prediction , but with @xmath17 .",
    "experiments by dantsker et al .",
    "@xcite on squids made with narrow superconducting lines separated by slots or holes ( for trapping flux quanta during cooldown in the earth s magnetic field ) have revealed that the presence of slots or holes increases the effective area over the value for a solid washer .",
    "this effect was confirmed experimentally by jansman et al .",
    ",  @xcite who were able to account for the increased effective area by treating the slotted washers as parallel circuits of pickup inductances .",
    "in this paper we introduce an approach suitable for extension to calculations of the magnetic - field and sheet - current - density distributions in superconducting thin - film strips , rings , and narrow lines .",
    "we consider the idealized case for which the penetration depth @xmath18 obeys @xmath19 or , if @xmath4 , the two - dimensional screening length @xmath20 obeys @xmath21 , such that the key boundary condition is that the normal component of the magnetic induction is zero on the surface of the superconductor .",
    "a complicating consequence is that the sheet - current distribution in the superconductor has inverse square - root singularities at the edges . while a mutual - inductance approach such as that used by gilchrist and brandt  @xcite and jansman et al .",
    "@xcite is always applicable , we show here that an approach taking into account the inverse - square - root singularities from the beginning is simpler and more efficient .    the authors of ref .",
    "obtained the flux - focusing result by superposition .",
    "they first calculated the induced current flowing in the clockwise direction in an applied magnetic induction @xmath22 assuming zero magnetic flux in the hole .",
    "they approximated this current using the known result for a superconducting disk with no central hole .",
    "they next calculated the induced current flowing in the counterclockwise direction in the absence of an applied field assuming a given amount of magnetic flux @xmath8 in the hole .",
    "they approximated this current using the known result for an infinite superconducting sheet with a round hole in it .",
    "finally they obtained the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath8 by equating the magnitudes of the two circulating currents . in the present paper , we show how to calculate all properties without making the small - hole approximations used in ref .  .",
    "we show how to solve the flux - focusing problem directly , as well as by superposition .",
    "another problem of interest is the calculation of the magnetic - field and current - density distribution for the case of a bulk - pinning - free type - ii superconducting disk of radius @xmath1 and thickness @xmath23 in which the entry of magnetic flux is impeded by a geometrical barrier .",
    "@xcite analytic solutions for the field and current distributions and the magnetization in strips subject to a geometrical barrier have been studied for the bulk - pinning - free case in refs .   and   and for the case of bean - model bulk pinning ( @xmath24 = const ) in ref .  .",
    "numerical results for the field and current distributions and the magnetization in disks subject to both a geometrical barrier and bulk pinning with a @xmath25-dependent @xmath24 have been presented in ref .  .",
    "in the following , we present an efficient method for calculating the field and current distributions and the magnetization in bulk - pinning - free disks subject to a geometrical barrier .",

    "the criteria we used for the critical entry and exit conditions lead to the result that @xmath290 , where the magnetization is given by @xmath291 . however , the above expressions for @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and @xmath294 are the least reliable results of our paper , because all these quantities are very sensitive to the precise conditions for entry and exit at the edge of the disk , including such details as the shape of the edge .  @xcite the magnetic moment responsible for the magnetization @xmath293 and @xmath294",
    "is produced by currents that flow only within a very narrow band around the disk s edge , where a theory more accurate than ours is needed .",
    "the minor hysteresis  loop , \" shown as the dashed curve in fig .  13 , can be calculated as follows .",
    "we start at a point on the field - increasing magnetization curve where the flux dome has radius @xmath295 .",
    "the magnetic flux contained within the dome @xmath296 , the magnetization @xmath297 , and the corresponding applied field @xmath261 are obtained from eqs.([phigz ] ) , ( [ mgz ] ) , and ( [ haentry ] ) , where @xmath99 , @xmath259 , and @xmath230 are all evaluated at @xmath298 . as the applied field @xmath7",
    "is reduced from its starting value @xmath261 , the radius @xmath0 of the flux dome expands , but the magnetic flux within the dome remains constant . for each value of @xmath299",
    ", we recalculate @xmath259 , @xmath230 , and @xmath300 .",
    "we then use eq .",
    "( [ phigz ] ) to obtain the corresponding value of the applied field , @xmath301 and eq .",
    "( [ mgz ] ) to obtain the corresponding value of the magnetization .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an efficient method for the calculation of magnetic - field and current - density profiles for thin - film rings in the meissner state and for bulk - pinning - free disks subject to a geometrical barrier . in each case , the sheet - current density was expressed in the form of eq .",

    ", we found that the magnitude of @xmath303 was less than 0.0012 in each case ( see figs .  2 , 5 , 8 , and 11 ) and that its contribution to @xmath51 was less than 1.1% . using @xmath304 yields values of @xmath305 whose magnitudes are much smaller than those of @xmath303 , and",
    "the values of the calculated physical quantities are altered only in the sixth decimal place .",
    "moreover , we offer the conjecture that the problems we solved numerically in secs .",

    "as evidence in support of this conjecture , we note that our calculations for @xmath309 and 0.5 with @xmath52 = 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 yielded values of @xmath310 [ eqs .",
    "( [ l ] ) and ( [ phiiz ] ) ] that differed only in the fifth decimal place .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath311 [ eq .  ( [ iz ] ) ] , @xmath160 [ eq.([aeff ] ) ] , and @xmath312 [ eqs .  ( [ mgz ] ) and ( [ haentry ] ) ] calculated for @xmath309 and 0.5 with @xmath52 = 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 differed at most only in the fourth significant figure .",
    "it is possible that the values we obtained for @xmath313 and @xmath314 in secs .",
    "iii - vi were nonzero only because of small numerical errors introduced because we performed the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ hm])-([phim ] ) numerically rather than analytically .",
    "although in this paper we have considered only bulk - pinning - free thin - film rings and disks , it should be possible to extend the present approach to develop an efficient method , complementary to that of ref .",
