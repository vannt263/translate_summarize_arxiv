    "the analysis reported here was done in the years 20013 in collaboration with three senior members of the bes collaboration .",
    "the work was funded by the royal society and queen mary college via a contractual agreement with the chinese academy of sciences and the bes collaboration .",
    "this contract guaranteed access to bes 2 data for the purpose of publications .",
    "since then , the bes management has refused to appoint internal referees , hence blocking a collaboration publication .",
    "the data illuminate the spectroscopy of @xmath18 mesons and should be in the public domain .",
    "there is a responsibility to publish work which has been supported from public funds with approximately @xmath19 .",
    "the wording of the present article is close to a document submitted late in 2008 to the bes management , but some further detail is added in section 8 .",
    "there have been several earlier studies of @xmath20 .",
    "the mark iii @xcite and dm2 collaborations @xcite observed a large @xmath8 signal and peaks at 1500 , 1760 and 2100 mev .",
    "later , expt .",
    "e760 at fermilab found three peaks in @xmath21 @xcite with masses and widths very similar to those in @xmath22 . in the @xmath21 channel , quantum numbers",
    "@xmath5 are forbidden by bose statistics .",
    "a re - analysis of the mark iii data @xcite led to the conclusion that the peaks have quantum numbers @xmath23 , but sit on a large @xmath24 signal extending over the whole mass range up to 2400 mev .",
    "bes i data led to similar conclusions @xcite , but added the identification of a broad @xmath25 signal at @xmath26 gev , decaying to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    here",
    "statistics a factor 7 higher are presented from bes ii , using 58 m @xmath1 hadronic interactions .",
    "the new data reveal further detail in the @xmath8 sector .",
    "there is clear evidence for a @xmath8 resonance at 1970 mev .",
    "this new feature alters details of what may be fitted in this mass range to @xmath29 and the @xmath30 amplitude .",
    "there is also a strong @xmath28 peak at @xmath31 mev .",
    "two alternative ways of fitting this peak are presented .",
    "the first alternative is that it may simply be a threshold @xmath28 cusp .",
    "the second investigates evidence that the peak is actually resonant .",
    "the distinction between the two alternatives depends rather delicately on the phase of the @xmath8 amplitude . in the @xmath32 sector",
    ", there is clear evidence for the existence of an @xmath13 which is definitely distinct from @xmath14 .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 concerns technicalities of data selection and reduction of experimental backgrounds .",
    "there is a troublesome background at high @xmath3 mass from @xmath33 , mostly @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this background has little consequence below 2 gev , but does obstruct separation of @xmath30 and @xmath36 from 2 to 2.3 gev .",
    "sections 3 and 4 present a fit to the @xmath3 mass spectrum in slices of mass .",
    "the key point is that @xmath1 radiative decays are pointlike , because of the large @xmath37 mass and because photons interact at a point .",
    "the consequence is that only the lowest angular momentum states contribute , making the selection of partial waves clean , see fig .",
    "the dominant @xmath5 channel , produced by an m1 transition , varies in intensity as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is photon momentum .",
    "superimposed on this broad signal is a narrow structure requiring the phase variation of a resonance at @xmath40 mev .    for @xmath32 , there is a strong clear @xmath13 peak , definitely distinct from @xmath14 , see figs .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the @xmath41 channel is fairly weak .",
    "there is a definite signal in the mass range 22.3 gev , but it is difficult to say whether it is a single broad component or may be due to more than one resonance . the experimental background is the limiting feature in this mass range .",
    "section 5 shows detailed fits to @xmath3 mass projections .",
    "section 6 concerns the question of how to fit the dominant very broad @xmath8 component .",
    "from other data , it is known that there are threshold peaks , see fig .",
    "10 , in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as well as in the strong @xmath28 signal observed here .",
    "one or more of these peaks could be resonant , but it seems unlikely there is one resonance per channel .",
    "the alternative is that they are threshold cusps .",
    "the formula fitting the broad @xmath8 component is based on this conservative approach .",
    "section 7 concerns fitted branching fractions .",
    "the fit to the @xmath3 mass spectrum from 1500 to 1650 mev is not perfect in this approach .",
    "this mass range can be fitted significantly better if the strong peak observed in @xmath28 ( and elsewhere in @xmath46 ) is resonant . however , in the absence of strong interferences with other partial waves , this evidence for a resonance is tentative , and is discussed in section 8 .",
    "there is one feature of the present data which is in strong disagreement to an earlier publication claiming an @xmath47 resonance which completely dominates data on @xmath48 .",
    "it is suggested in section 9 that an alternative way of fitting those data is in terms of a simple cusp due to the @xmath42 p - wave threshold .",
    "section 10 summarises conclusions and the appendix outlines the su2 relation concerning section 9 .",
    "the data presented here were taken with the besii detector .",
    "full details of the detector and its upgrade are reported by bai et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has cylindrical symmetry around the intersecting @xmath49 beams .",
    "its essential features are ( i ) a main drift chamber ( mdc ) for the measurement of charged particles , ( ii ) time of flight detectors with a @xmath50 of 180 ps , and ( iii ) a 12 radiation length barrel shower counter comprised of gas proportional tubes interleaved with lead sheets . the mdc measures @xmath51 .",
    "together with the time of flight detectors , it separates @xmath52 and @xmath53 up to @xmath54 mev / c .",
    "outside the @xmath55 detectors is a magnet providing a field of 0.4 t .",
    "this magnet is instrumented with muon detectors , but for present work they serve simply to reject @xmath56 pairs .",
    "the main drift chamber provides full coverage of charged particles for lab angles @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "events are selected initially by demanding four charged tracks in the main drift chamber with balancing charges , plus at least one photon in the lead - scintillator detectors .",
    "any charged track with either time - of - flight or @xmath51 favouring kaon identification is rejected .",
    "charged tracks are required to have a transverse momentum @xmath59 mev / c ; this reduces background from @xmath60 .",
    "a geometrical cut is applied to ensure that all particles lie inside a region well inside the known detector geometry , so as to eliminate edge effects in detector performance and acceptance .",
    "the vertex is required to lie within a cylindrical region of radius 2 cm and @xmath61 cm in length , with respect to the known intersection point of the @xmath49 beams .",
    "events have then been fitted kinematically to @xmath62 , using all photon showers in turn ; some photons may originate from interactions of charged particles in the detector , but any photons within a cone of @xmath63 around a charged particle are rejected .",
    "events with a @xmath64 probability @xmath65 are selected .",
    "it is also required that @xmath64 is better than that for likely background channels : ( a ) @xmath3 ignoring photons , ( b ) @xmath66 if there is more than one photon and @xmath67 is within 50 mev of the @xmath68 mass .",
    "a small detail is that background from @xmath69 has been rejected by a cut @xmath70 mev , where the @xmath68 is associated with missing momentum . also , to remove a small background from @xmath71 , a double cut is made on the two @xmath72 masses : @xmath73 mev .",
    "the monte carlo generates 300k events to simulate the bes detector and its acceptance ; it uses the standard simbes package released in february 2002 , in its version as of march 2003 . during discussions with the bes management",
    ", they have claimed that alterations to the calibration of the time - of - flight system after march 2003 could affect the selection of events .",
    "i have investigated this claim thoroughly and it has no foundation .",
    "firstly , there is excellent agreement between @xmath51 and time - of - flight measurements .",
    "secondly , a search has been made for contamination of data due to misidentified @xmath74 events .",
    "these are rather well separated from @xmath75 events by kinematics as well as @xmath51 and time - of - flight . for @xmath76 of events ,",
    "the kinematic fit alone fails to fit @xmath77 by a difference of @xmath78 .",
    "this is because production angles are sensitive to the different masses of kaons and pions .",

    "( results for other @xmath72 combinations are similar ) .",
    "there is an obvious @xmath83 signal ; a small dip at 500 mev arises from the cut against @xmath84 .",
    "next , these events have been fitted to all four combinations of @xmath74 after @xmath51 and time - of - flight cuts .",
    "events fitting with a @xmath85 have the @xmath86 mass distribution shown in fig .",
    "it is known from bes 1 data @xcite that the @xmath77 channel contains a very strong @xmath87 signal .",
    "there is no evidence for this in fig .",
    "1(b ) , demonstrating that any contamination from @xmath74 is @xmath88 of good @xmath75 events . likewise there is no structure in the @xmath89 mass spectrum of fig .",
    "1(c ) shows the @xmath90 mass spectrum from events surviving the @xmath51 and time - of - flight cuts but fitted as @xmath77 .",
    "one sees that the effect of the kinematic fit to the wrong @xmath74 hypothesis is to shift the @xmath83 peak down in mass .    other background processes and the acceptance for data",
    "are studied using the standard simbes monte carlo simulation of the detector .",
    "the main background arises from the @xmath91 channel after the loss of one photon .",
    "this is well known from all earlier publications .",
    "the @xmath92 channel has been studied by dm2 @xcite .",
    "it contains a strong @xmath34 signal , a less prominent @xmath35 signal and thirdly a diffuse signal over all of phase space .",
    "the monte carlo has been used to generate @xmath34 and @xmath35 events with the acceptance of the bes 2 detector .",
    "background from these channels in @xmath75 data peak strongly at high @xmath3 mass , because of the loss of low energy photons associated with low energy @xmath68 .",
    "this background dominates the @xmath3 mass range @xmath93 mev / c@xmath94 , allowing a firm determination of its magnitude .",

    "the background due to @xmath34 leads to an @xmath96 peak in the @xmath97 mass distribution , shown in fig .",
    "its magnitude is fitted freely and is consistent within errors with the branching fraction quoted by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath98 is sufficiently broad that the @xmath35 background after cuts is consistent within errors with @xmath99 phase space and is fitted like that .",
    "this background contribution is somewhat larger than dm2 quote , suggesting that further diffuse background close to @xmath99 phase space is also present .",
    "the combination of @xmath35 and diffuse background is again fitted freely to the @xmath3 mass range above 2.4 gev .",
    "the sum of experimental backgrounds from @xmath34 and @xmath35 is shown below by the dotted curve in fig .",

    "2(d ) shows the whole mass distribution for @xmath103 after the full event selection .",
    "peaks are visible below a mass of 2.4 gev . above that ,",
    "background dominates , so the analysis reported here is confined to the mass range below 2400 mev .",
    "the total background up to 2.4 gev is 27.3@xmath104 of the whole @xmath75 sample .    from monte carlo studies ,",
    "estimated backgrounds from @xmath105 and @xmath106 are @xmath107 ; the latter background is peaked at high @xmath108 masses , like the @xmath101 background , and is mostly removed by selecting events with @xmath3 mass @xmath109 mev .",
    "required channels are @xmath28 , @xmath110 and @xmath27",
    ". there are several parametrisations of the @xmath50 amplitude with increasing complexity as its couplings to @xmath89 , @xmath111 and @xmath3 have been unravelled @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . only the coupling to @xmath90 is important here .",
    "all have been tried in the analysis , but there is little to choose between them .",
    "the first formula parametrises @xmath90 data adequately and gives slightly the best fit ; it is the simplest and is used here",

    "the dominant process for production of @xmath122 with @xmath5 requires @xmath123 .",
    "the coupling of the photon to @xmath37 is a point interaction . because the charmed quarks are massive , the interaction of gluons with @xmath37 is expected to be of very short range , with a radius parameter of order @xmath124 fm .",
    "the intensity for @xmath125 is then proportional to @xmath126 , ( where @xmath127 is the momentum of the photon and hence the @xmath3 system ) , multiplied by a very slowly varying form factor discussed below .",
    "the data are indeed close to the predicted @xmath126 dependence .",
    "this has an important consequence : production with @xmath128 should be strongly inhibited .",
    "higher @xmath121 values were tried in the fit , and in all cases are negligible .",
    "this leads to a major simplification in the analysis .",

    "is presented in ref .",
    "it involves a lorentz transformation of @xmath140 and @xmath141 to the centre of mass of x. apart from this complication , the formula for production and decay of @xmath8 is given by @xmath142 .",

    "3(a ) , the @xmath5 amplitude appears to be made of two components : peaks at 1600 and 2100 mev .",
    "however , the data can not be fitted successfully like that .",
    "the reason is that there is clear evidence for phase variation consistent with a resonance near 1970 mev interfering with the broad @xmath8 component .",
    "a good fit is obtained with a peak at @xmath31 mev in the broad component , dropping smoothly to 2400 mev , plus an interfering component over the mass range 1850 to 2200 mev , as shown below in fig .",

    "4 displays information on phases from the slice fit after integrating over all angles .",
    "errors for @xmath8 , @xmath36 and @xmath41 are determined from the change in log likelihood as the phase of each individual partial wave is moved in steps .",
