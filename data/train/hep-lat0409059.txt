    "such a modification was observed for the nc @xmath11 model @xcite .",
    "this is due to a remarkable feature of the nc field theories , the uv / ir mixing of divergences @xcite . that property makes the perturbative treatment beyond one loop extremely difficult",
    "we carried out simulations involving two nc directions , as well as two commutative directions , which include the euclidean time . to be explicit , we set @xmath12 . the parameter @xmath13 was assumed to be constant throughout the space - time .",
    "in order to perform monte carlo simulations one needs to formulate the theory on a lattice .",
    "this is achieved by the operator relation @xcite @xmath14 which imposes a discrete non - commutative space - time .",

    "[ plaquettes ] . in that plot",
    "the results are split according to the plaquette orientations ( nc , mixed and commutative ) . the real part of the nc wilson loops oscillates , while eventually decaying towards zero .",

    "however , in that case the decay does _ not _ seem exponential .",
    "we have simulated a nc u(@xmath2 ) field theory .",
    "first observables such as the action , plaquettes , wilson loops and creutz ratios could be measured .",
    "the results for the action and plaquettes agree with asymptotic predictions .",
    "there seems to be a vanishing string tension at weak coupling in the part of the parameter space we explored .",
    "further work will hopefully allow us to identify a physical scale and to extrapolate to a nc continuum limit by means of double scaling ( i.e.a fixed product @xmath39 ) .",
