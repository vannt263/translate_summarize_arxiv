    "the large - scale structure ( lss ) surveys provide a wealth of cosmological information of our universe .",
    "particularly , the wiggling feature of the baryonic acoustic oscillation imprinted in the matter power spectrum encodes the characteristic scale of sound horizon @xmath3 , which serves as a standard ruler and a robust method for measuring the cosmological distance @xcite .",
    "since its first detection in sdss by @xcite , bao has then become essential for almost all ongoing and future lss surveys . despite the fact that @xmath0 being relatively large , as the universe evolves , its measurement accuracy from the power spectrum ( or two - point correlation function ) starts to decrease rather rapidly due to the non - linear gravitational effect .",
    "statistically , the information leaks into higher order statistics , e.g. bispectra or trispectra etc .",
    ", as the fields become more and more non - gaussian with increased variance .",
    "this could be seen from the measurement of the so - called fisher information , as a plateau would appear at quasi - linear regime where the bao feature resides @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the same structure formation process would move galaxies away from their initial locations , and erase this feature encoded initially @xcite .",
    "eventually , one starts to lose the constraining power on cosmology due to the combined effect of non - gaussianity and the degraded bao signal @xcite .",
    "this situation then leads to numerous efforts to reconstruct the bao signature and improve the measurement precision of the sound horizon scale from lss .",
    "for example , a logarithmic transformation or gaussianization processes seem to improve the non - gaussianity and bring back some information leaked into higher order statistics @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite ( hereafter za reconstruction ) first demonstrated that it is possible to sharpen the bao peak in the correlation function and improve the measurement accuracy .",
    "this simple yet powerful algorithm has since then be improved and applied to real measurement @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as the physical picture starts to clarify , more algorithms emerge @xcite .    historically , the attempt to undo the non - linear structure formation process dates far back before these efforts .",
    "@xcite first applied the principle of least action to reconstruct the trajectories of local group .",
    "this technique was then further developed by other authors @xcite but without any application to cosmology due to its computational cost .",
    "on the other hand , various dynamical approaches were trying to inverse the dynamical system without any decaying modes so that observational errors will not overpower the real initial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as the computational processing power increases steadily in recent years , there are also attempts to directly sample all possible initial states by markov chain monte carlo method with fast forward model @xcite . unlike most previous works",
    ", @xcite tried to recover the linear power spectrum instead of initial density distribution , which is almost uniform , @xmath4 , and therefore practically much more challenging .    from the perspective of lagrangian dynamics , the strong non - linearity presented in the density field @xmath5 is attributed to both the gravitational evolution of the particle movement , manifested by the non - linear displacement @xmath6 of particles , and the coordinate transform between lagrangian and eulerian frame , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the eulerian and lagrangian position respectively . with the assumption of the mass conservation and a uniform matter distribution at the initial state ,",
    "this coordinate transform could simply be expressed as @xmath9 recently , one starts to realize that equation ( [ eqn : contn ] ) is the major source of various theoretical and practical difficulties encountered in the large - scale structure measurement @xcite .",
    "therefore , by avoiding this extra non - linearity , the displacement field itself would be less non - linear and much easier to handle theoretically . of course , by definition , @xmath10 is not an observable as it involves the unknown initial location @xmath8 . as a result",
    ", there have been efforts concentrating on the statistical extraction of @xmath10 , e.g. the maximum likelihood method by @xcite .    in principle , given a non - linear density map @xmath5 , and assuming that only the longitudinal component of the displacement field , i.e. @xmath11 , is cosmologically relevant , equation ( [ eqn : contn ] ) reduces to the so - called elliptical monge - ampre equation and becomes solvable with appropriate boundary condition .",
    "if the input density map @xmath5 is generated from particles movement without any crossing nor rotation , i.e. no transverse component of @xmath10 , the recovered solution would be exactly the one we desire .",
    "in reality , however , these transverse components do emerge , but only at smaller scales @xcite .",
    "therefore the resultant reconstruction error in the bao regime is negligible .",
    "recently , @xcite first proposed to apply the _ potential isobaric reconstruction _",
    "algorithm to solve equation ( [ eqn : contn ] ) for the displacement potential @xmath12 , and demonstrated the high correlation with initial density field , while @xcite showed that the fisher information of the reconstructed field are significantly increased especially at quasi - linear regime , and then @xcite studied for halo density field .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the same algorithm and particularly concentrate on the improvement of cosmological information from measuring the baryonic acoustic oscillation . in section 2 . , we first review this algorithm and demonstrate their ability to recover the nonlinear displacement field .",
    "we focus on the bao signature in section 3 . , and show the recovered wiggles and improved accuracy in cosmological measurement .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss in section 4 . throughout this paper",
    ", the n - body simulations were run with numerical code cube , with the box size of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 particles .",
    "we adopt the planck 2015 results @xcite as our fiducial cosmological parameters .",
    "as a non - linear partial differential equation , the numerical solution to equation ( [ eqn : contn ] ) is nontrivial . even though various numerical strategies , e.g. @xcite , do exist in literatures ,",
    "the major challenge for the cosmological application here is the frame mismatch between the lagrangian gradient of the displacement @xmath15 and the eulerian density field @xmath16 . in this paper , we follow the multi - grid algorithm proposed by @xcite to iteratively solve the differential form of this mass conservation equation in a moving curvilinear coordinate system , which we name as the _ potential isobaric coordinate_.    to present our numerical algorithm , we simply take the differentiation of equation ( [ eqn : contn ] ) with respect to some time - like iteration parameter @xmath17 , and obtain the conservation equation @xmath18 = 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of a unit lagrangian volume . for a fixed eulerian fluid element",
    ", however , it further simplifies to @xmath19 .",
    "notice that both equations ( [ eqn : contn ] ) and ( [ eqn : maelin ] ) are expressed locally , and do not care about any particular path of maintaining the conservation , as long as the density and volume of given fluid element vary consistently .",
    "however , from the field s perspective , equation ( [ eqn : maelin ] ) is nothing but the continuity equation with respect to parameter @xmath17 .",
    "following the same notation of @xcite , in a curvilinear coordinate @xmath20 , we adopt the following ansatz for the coordinate transform at each iteration step @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the increment of the displacement potential .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , in the isobaric frame , i.e. the mass per volume element is kept constant , the continuity equation could be expressed as a linear elliptic equation @xmath23 where the dreibein @xmath24 is the inverse of the triad , or the jacobian matrix , @xmath25 , the volume element @xmath26 . for given non - linear density map @xmath27 , we would like to reverse the frame deformation , and solve for the increment of displacement potential @xmath22 , where @xmath28 with the assumption that @xmath29 since we are free from parametrizing @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this is done by substituting @xmath30 in equation ( [ eqn : poisson_curv ] ) with the negative non - linear density contrast @xmath31 together with a spatial smoothing @xmath32 to ensure the smallness of the resultant @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the compression and expansion limiters for improving the numerical stability @xcite .",
    "consequently , the triad @xmath36 would always be kept as positive definite . after moving the grid with equation ( [ eqn : curv_grid ] )",
    ", we estimate the density increment @xmath30 from equation ( [ eqn : poisson_curv ] ) and then repeat equation ( [ eqn : dphi_curv ] ) with re - evaluated density contrast @xmath37 .",
    "comparison of bao signature ( _ upper _ ) and the dependence of the power spectra with respect to the sound horizon @xmath0 scale ( _ lower _ ) at redshift @xmath38 . to eliminate the sample variance",
    ", we run a few n - body simulations and reconstructions with different transfer functions ( with different assumptions of bao ) but the same initial random seeds . for za reconstruction @xcite",
    ", we assume a gaussian smoothing with @xmath39.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    eventually , the reconstructed displacement potential is simply a summation of all iterations , @xmath40 here we have explicitly denoted the _",
    "one - to - one _ mapping between the intermediate and final coordinate @xmath41 , which is only possible because of the positive definiteness of the transform matrix @xmath36 we achieved in solving equation ( [ eqn : dphi_curv ] ) . as a result ,",
    "our final product @xmath42 is then charted in a frame @xmath43 that would be almost identical to the theoretically defined lagrangian coordinate @xmath8 , and we will have @xmath44 at the _ pixel level_.    in the first column of figure [ fig : snapshot ] .",
    ", i.e. panel @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( with the same colorbar ) , one could see that this is indeed the case .",
    "the simulated displacement potential @xmath47 ( _ panel @xmath46 _ ) is simply calculated by taking the longitudinal component of the real displacement .",
    "the visual difference is not very obvious even if we compare with the full displacement vector field , i.e. @xmath48 ( _ panel @xmath49 _ ) versus @xmath50 ( _ panel @xmath51 _ ) , when transverse contribution starts to emerge after the shell - crossing .",
    "as shown in the histogram of @xmath52 ( _ panel @xmath53 _ ) , the reconstruction error is within a percent level for @xmath42 , and roughly ten - percent level for displacement @xmath54 itself ( _ panel @xmath55 _ ) .    in panel @xmath56 and @xmath57 of figure",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] . , we also display a visual comparison between the input density map and its residual after @xmath58 iterations .",
    "as one could see , the non - vanishing residuals are basically around high density region , where the displacement field @xmath54 would no longer be captured only by longitudinal component , @xmath59 , anymore . as shown from the power spectra of the residual map in panel @xmath60 ,",
    "this starts to occur around the comoving fourier scale @xmath61 and peaks around @xmath62 , where although the large scale power eventually decays to about six orders of magnitude smaller compared to the input , small - scale power is still around unity .",
    "we are particularly interested in applying this isobaric reconstruction algorithm to detect the bao signature in the power spectrum .",
    "as demonstrated by various authors , e.g. @xcite , in the nonlinear density field , the sharp bao features from the initial fluctuation @xmath63 is smeared out by the bulk flow of the galaxies even at the relatively large bao scale .",
    "this could be seen by simply expressing the nonlinear density @xmath5 from the continuity equation ( [ eqn : contn ] ) in fourier space , and then taking the ensemble average , so the nonlinear power spectra reads @xcite @xmath64   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & g^2(k ) p_{\\rm ini } ( k ) + p_{\\rm mc}(k ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the so - called non - linear propagator @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the model - coupling contribution and @xmath70 is the variance of the velocity .",
    "since @xmath69 dominates at large @xmath71 and is quite smooth , the bao feature which could be defined as dividing @xmath72 by some no - wiggle template @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 would be smeared out at lower redshift and smaller scale by the bulk flow @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that with our reconstruction algorithm , one will no longer be affected by this smearing .     the fractional error of measuring the sound horizon scale @xmath1 as a function of maximum @xmath71 for a noiseless survey of volume @xmath76 at redshift @xmath38 . the measurement precision after the isobaric reconstruction is very close to the linear theory , which assumes both linear power spectra and gaussian covariance matrix ( equation [ eqn : cov_gau ] ) .",
    "the error after the reconstruction is roughly @xmath77 times smaller than original density field , compared to a factor of @xmath78 smaller for the za reconstruction method .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to examine the reconstructed bao signature , we run a few n - body simulations with different transfer functions ( with or without bao , and with different @xmath0 ) but the same initial random seeds .",
    "this enables us to reveal the signal with little numerical efforts but free from the sample variance . as shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : bao ] .",
    ", at redshift @xmath38 , bao signature becomes basically invisible after the fourth peaks ( _ red - dashed line _ ) , whereas the non - linear displacement potential @xmath47 ( _ blue - dashed line _ )",
    "is almost identical to the initial density field ( _ red - dotted line _ ) in this @xmath71 range .",
    "the bao of the reconstructed field @xmath42 ( _ black - solid line _ ) , are recovered with very high fidelity ( even the eighth peak is still visible ) , although there does seem to exist a percent - level overall shape change . with an appropriate template , the sound horizon scale @xmath0 would be recovered at a level that is very close to the linear theory , this could be seen from the numerical derivative @xmath79 in the lower panel of figure [ fig : bao ] . , which is derived from running simulations and reconstructions with slightly different @xmath0 . as a comparison , we also display the performance of za reconstruction method @xcite assuming a gaussian smoothing at @xmath80 , with which the bao is only moderately recovered .",
    "to evaluate the impact on the constraints of the cosmic distance , we estimate the fisher information on the sound horizon scale @xmath0 for a noiseless survey . by definition ,",
    "the fisher matrix is @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the normalized covariance matrix @xmath83 which is estimated from @xmath84 n - body simulations . to resemble a realistic survey , we then rescaled the large - scale component ( @xmath85 ) of matrix @xmath82 to coincide with the theoretical gaussian covariance matrix @xmath86 @xmath87 assuming a survey volume of @xmath88 , here @xmath89 is the number of @xmath71 modes of such survey .    in figure [",
    "fig : dserr ] . , we show that the fractional error on the sound horizon @xmath1 measured from our reconstructed field is roughly @xmath77 times smaller than from the non - linear density field itself ( _ red dashed line _ ) .",
    "this is very close to the accuracy one could ever achieve by measuring linear bao ( _ black - dotted line _ ) feature and gaussian covariance matrix . as a comparison ,",
    "the same number is roughly @xmath78 for the za reconstruction .",
    "as a method to get around one of the most strongest non - linearity in the structure formation process , we believe our reconstruction algorithm will significantly affect the way we measure large - scale structure in the future . however , in this paper , we did not take into account of various complications , e.g. the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) , and the biasing . in redshift space",
    ", it would be quite straightforward to express the reconstructed field as a combination with original displacement with peculiar velocity @xmath90 , and would be relative easy to recover @xmath54 by performing some wiener filter after the reconstruction .",
    "the biasing , on the other hand , is much more challenging , because unlike rsd the filter itself would then depend on the galaxies type .",
    "most naively , one could simply fix the bias parameters from the unconstructed density field , e.g. via hod fitting or simply linear bias @xcite .",
    "alternatively , without any preprocessing , one could also perform the reconstruction for the biased density field itself . in this case",
    ", the reconstructed potential field @xmath91 will not be the same as the real displacement of these tracers anymore , but instead will also include the information of their formation as well @xcite ."
