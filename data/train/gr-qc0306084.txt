    "for much of its history , experimental observation of quantum gravitational effects has been little more than an impossible dream for general relativity . yet",
    "recent theoretical developments have begun to alter this view .",
    "new ideas in quantum gravity , including string theory , are being explored , which , if correct , would imply the presence of quantum gravitational behavior at length scales much larger than planckian  @xcite .",
    "combined with emerging sensor and other technologies , these speculations are raising the specter of near - term experimental tests for some of the most fundamental manifestations of quantum spacetime structure .",
    "an imperfect but illuminating analogy can be pursued in the physics of fluids .",
    "consider a hypothetical stage in the development of the theory of fluids in which we are unaware of the atomic structure of matter , while we understand the navier - stokes equations and are somehow aware of planck s constant , @xmath0 . in this analogy , the atomic structure of fluids is the unknown holy grail of quantum fluid mechanics which we are striving to discover with our limited knowledge .",
    "the fundamental quantities characterizing a fluid classically can be taken to be the speed of sound , @xmath1 , and the density , @xmath2 .",
    "along with @xmath0 , these quantities can be combined to define a length scale @xmath3 which would seem to set the quantum regime where classical fluid mechanics must break down . for typical fluids ( e.g.  water ) , @xmath4 is of order @xmath5 ; it does a remarkably good job of predicting the atomic scale .",
    "but in our hypothetical ignorance of atoms , we would be ill - advised to conclude that quantum effects must be negligible all the way down to the length scale @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , we know ( in hindsight ) from kinetic theory that the true length scale which sets the breakdown of classical fluid mechanics is the correlation length , which is typically much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "collective phenomena such as phase transitions may give rise to correlation lengths that are macroscopically large .",
    "even away from phase transitions , correlation lengths are large enough to have effects ( such as brownian motion ) that are readily observable in experiments performed far above the lengthscale @xmath4 .",
    "what this analogy teaches us is to be open to the possibility that , while the planck length sets the scale for quantum gravity , there may be quantum effects of the unknown small - scale structure of spacetime which are analogous to phase transitions or brownian motion , and which might be detectable at scales far above planck . in this paper",
    "we will explore one possible source for such effects : quantum fluctuations in a background spacetime causing decoherence in qubits kinematically coupled to that background . in a sense",
    ", such decoherence would be analogous to brownian motion caused by the small - scale structure of a fluid .",
    "we will make very few assumptions about the quantum theory of spacetime underlying the fluctuations , apart from demanding that it results in a hilbert space structure for states of the metric which obeys the standard laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "we will conclude the paper by discussing a slightly different scenario for gravitational decoherence : the decoherence of an accelerating qubit in minkowski spacetime due to the unruh effect . in this case",
    "decoherence is not due to fluctuations in the metric , but instead is caused by a coupling ( which we model with a standard hamiltonian ) between the qubit and the thermal cloud of unruh particles bathing it .",
    "a separate set of motivations for studying gravitational decoherence arises from relativistic quantum information theory , a new field of research that studies the properties of quantum information and quantum communication as seen by observers in moving frames .",
    "one of the most important ingredients of quantum information theory is entanglement , and much of the interest so far has been directed to its properties under lorentz transformations .",
    "czachor studied a version of the epr experiment with relativistic particles @xcite , and peres _ et al . _ demonstrated that the spin of an electron is not covariant under lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of lorentz transformations on maximally spin - entangled bell states in momentum eigenstates was studied by alsing and milburn @xcite , and gingrich and adami derived the general transformation rules for the spin - momentum entanglement of two qubits @xcite .",
    "recently , these results were extended to the lorentz transformation of polarization entanglement @xcite , and to situations where one observer is accelerated @xcite . here , we take a look at a different aspect of relativistic quantum information theory : the effect of decoherence on a qubit due to quantum fluctuations in the metric .",
    "we will now turn our attention to the study of decoherence in the four major paradigms of relativity : first , we will calculate the effect of flat fluctuations in the fabric of minkowski spacetime on a linearly moving qubit .",
    "next , we put a qubit in orbit around a black hole . the mass fluctuations due to the hawking radiation induce fluctuations in the schwarzschild metric , which in turn couple to our qubit . following black holes",
    ", we will study the interaction of a linearly moving qubit with coherent and squeezed gravity waves .",
    "coherent states correspond to classical gravitational waves which are expected to arise from astrophysical processes such as the inspiral of compact binaries , while squeezing arises due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "finally , we study a related but qualitatively different decoherence phenomenon : we derive the decoherence of a linearly accelerating qubit in a bath of unruh radiation .",
    "this treatment requires a field - theoretical description of the thermal unruh bath , while we will be content with a first - quantized description of the qubit , whose interaction with the quantum field of unruh particles we will model with a standard hamiltonian .",
    "first , we define a general quantum system to be in a state @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a complete set of ( non - degenerate and discrete ) eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the free evolution of @xmath8 is given by @xmath9    we consider the situation where the quantum system moves along a geodesic path in some fixed metric @xmath10 , while the true metric @xmath11 is subject to quantum fluctuations about @xmath10 .",
    "the proper time of the system is denoted by @xmath12 , and we have @xmath13 . the laboratory coordinates are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we want to know the state of the quantum system @xmath18 in laboratory coordinates .",
    "this depends on the metric @xmath11 : @xmath19 where the last equality follows from the geodesic motion of the quantum system .",
    "now suppose that the metric itself is a ( highly delocalized ) quantum system in a state @xmath20 .",
    "it is our central assumption that this quantum metric behaves as a regular quantum system . in particular , we assume that the superposition principle is valid for quantum states of the metric .",
    "we initialize the state of our quantum system at time @xmath21 in @xmath22 , and let it evolve freely within the metric @xmath23 for a certain period .",
    "the state of the system will generally become entangled with the metric , and we wish to determine the reduced density matrix of the system at time @xmath14 .    in general , the free evolution of an energy eigenstate @xmath24 in a particular quantum metric @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "there is no back - action of the state of the qubit onto the metric .",
