    "it is by now widely accepted that dark matter ( dm ) constitutes a substantial fraction of the present critical energy density in the universe .",
    "however , the nature of dm remains an open problem .",
    "there exist many dm candidates , most of them are non - baryonic weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , or wimp - like particles@xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the masses and cross sections of wimp ( or wimp - like ) candidates@xcite . by far the dm candidates",
    "that have been more intensively studied are the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) particles such as neutralinos or gravitinos , and the axions ( as well as the axinos ) .",
    "there are additional particle physics inspired dm candidates@xcite .",
    "a candidate which is not as closely related to particle physics is the relics of primordial black holes ( pbhs)@xcite .",
    "earlier it was suggested that pbhs are a natural candidate for dm@xcite .",
    "more recent studies@xcite based on the pbh production from the  blue spectrum \" of inflation demand that the spectral index @xmath0 , but this possibility may be ruled out by recent wmap experiment@xcite .",
    "there are also other studies on the idea of pbh as dm@xcite .",
    "one weakness of the notion of pbh as dm is the ambiguity on the final property of small black holes .",
    "the standard view of black hole thermodynamics@xcite does not provide an answer as to whether a small black hole should evaporate entirely , or leave something else behind , which we refer to as a black hole remnant ( bhr ) .",
    "numerous calculations of black hole radiation properties have been made from different points of view@xcite , and some hint at the existence of remnants , but none appear to give a definitive answer .    in a recent paper@xcite , a generalized uncertainty principle (",
    "gup)@xcite was invoked to argue that the total evaporation of a black hole may be prevented , and as a result there should exist a black hole remnant with planck mass and size . here",
    "we speculate that the stability of such bhr may be further protected by supersymmetry , in the form of the extremal black hole@xcite .",
    "such a bhr is totally inert , with no attributes other than gravitational interaction , and is thus a natural candidate for dm .",
    "it remains unclear , however , whether such a notion can be smoothly incorporated into the standard cosmology .",
    "we note that certain inflation models naturally induce a large number of small black holes . as a specific example , we demonstrate that the hybrid inflation@xcite cosmology can in principle yield the necessary abundance of primordial bhrs for them to be the primary source of dark matter .",
    "we show that such a construction is not fine - tuned .",
    "as a result of string theory@xcite , or noncommutative spacetime algebra@xcite , or general considerations of quantum mechanics and gravity@xcite , the standard uncertainty principle must be modified when the gravity effect is included .",
    "a heuristic derivation may be made on dimensional grounds .",
    "consider a particle such as an electron being observed by means of a photon with momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the usual heisenberg argument leads to an electron position uncertainty given by @xmath2 .",
    "but we should add to this a term due to the gravitational interaction between the electron and the photon , and that term must be proportional to @xmath3 times the photon energy , or @xmath4 . since the electron momentum uncertainty @xmath5 will be of order of @xmath1",
    ", we see that on dimensional grounds the extra term must be of order @xmath6 .",
    "note that there is no @xmath7 in the extra term when expressed in this way .",
    "the effective position uncertainty is therefore @xmath8 where @xmath9 cm is the planck length . here",
    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath10 can be considered either as related to the string tension from the string theory s motivation , or simply as a factor to account for the imprecision of our heuristic derivation which can only be fixed by a precise theory of quantum gravity in the future .",
    "note that eq.([eq : b ] ) has a minimum value of @xmath11 , so the planck length ( or @xmath12 ) plays the role of a fundamental length .",
    "the hawking temperature for a spherically symmetric black hole may be obtained in a heuristic way with the use of the standard uncertainty principle and general properties of black holes@xcite . in the vicinity of the black hole surface",
    "there is an intrinsic uncertainty in the position of any vacuum - fluctuating particle of about the schwarzschild radius , @xmath13 , due to the behavior of its field lines@xcite - as well as on dimensional grounds .",
    "this leads to a momentum uncertainty @xmath5 . identifying @xmath14 as the characteristic energy of the emitted photon , and thus as a characteristic temperature ( with the insertion of a calibration factor @xmath15 ) , one arrives at the celebrated hawking temperature , @xmath16 .",
    "applying the same argument , but invoking the gup , one then finds a modified black hole temperature , @xmath17\\ , \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the bh mass in units of the planck mass : @xmath19gev .",
    "this agrees with the hawking result for large mass if the negative sign is chosen , whereas the positive sign has no evident physical meaning .",
    "note that the temperature becomes complex and unphysical for mass less than @xmath20 and schwarzschild radius less than @xmath21 , the minimum size allowed by the gup . at @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 is finite but its slope is infinite , which corresponds to zero heat capacity of the black hole .",
    "the bh evaporation thus comes to a stop , and what remains is a inert bhr with mass @xmath22 .",
    "if there are @xmath24 species of relativistic particles , then the bh evaporation rate ( assuming the stefan - boltzmann law ) is @xmath25 ^ 4 \\",
    ", \\label{eq : i}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a characteristic time for bh evaporation , and @xmath27sec is the planck time .",
    "note that the energy output given by eq.([eq : i ] ) is finite at the end point where @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "thus the hole with an initial mass @xmath29 evaporates to a remnant in a time given by @xmath30 \\cr & \\approx & \\frac{\\mu_i^3}{3g}t_{ch } , \\quad\\quad \\mu_i\\gg 1\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the evaporation time in the @xmath31 limit agrees with the standard hawking picture .",
    "even if the gup may prevent a small black hole from total evaporation , it remains unclear whether the resultant bhr will be prohibited from decaying into the vacuum . in our previous work@xcite",
    "we argued that the total collapse of a black hole may be prevented by dynamics ( i.e. , the gup ) and not by symmetry , just like the prevention of hydrogen atom from collapse by the standard uncertainty principle@xcite . in a closer look the hydrogen atom argument may be only fortuitous , as there exist counter - examples such as the finite lifetime of the positronium . therefore to protect the stability of the bhr",
    ", the existence of a symmetry principle in the system appears essential .    in this regard supersymmetry ,",
    "in particular supergravity , stands a very good chance of providing such a protection to bhr .",
    "it is well - known that the no - hair theorem allows for only three attributes of a classical black hole , namely , its mass , charge and angular momentum . for the extreme kerr - newman bh",
    ", we have the limiting case where @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the bh mass , @xmath34 the bh charge associated with certain gauge symmetry , and @xmath35 is the bh angular momentum per unit mass . in the special case where the bh has no angular momentum",
    ", it reaches the extremal condition of @xmath36 .",
    "it has been shown that in certain specific realizations of supergravity , there exist extremal black hole solutions@xcite .",
    "as supergravity  charge \" is in units of planck mass , this condition dictates that the bh mass is bounded by the planck mass .",
    "we speculate that the extremal condition should remain intact even when susy is broken .",
    "if the primordial black holes were generated in the very early epoch of the universe , such as the one immediately following inflation , it is likely that susy was still unbroken .",
    "then the pbhs so generated could be either straight - forwardly the susy extremal bhs governed by supergravity , or the small but classical bhs described above .",
    "we believe that , governed by the gup , the latter would soon reduce to planck - size bhrs whose final state then coincides with the extremal bh condition . in either case",
    "we expect the existence of bhrs at planck size .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this notion can be physically realized .",
    "more efforts are evidently needed beyond the simple - minded comments made here .",
    "a study in this direction based on string theory is currently underway@xcite .",
    "we now return to the scenario of a semi - classical bh and combine this notion with the hybrid inflation proposed by a. linde@xcite . in the hybrid inflation model two inflaton fields , @xmath37 , are invoked .",
    "governed by the inflation potential , @xmath38 @xmath39 first executes a  slow - roll \" down the potential , and is responsible for the more than 60 e - folds expansion while @xmath40 remains zero .",
    "when @xmath39 eventually reduces to a critical value , @xmath41 , it triggers a phase transition that results in a  rapid - fall \" of the energy density of the @xmath40 field , which lasts only for a few e - folds , that ends the inflation .",
    "the equations of motion for the fields are @xmath42 subject to the friedmann constraint , @xmath43\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : m}\\ ] ] the solution for the @xmath40 field in the small @xmath39 regime , measured backward from the end of inflation , is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of e - folds from @xmath46 to @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we now show how a large number of small black holes can result from the second stage of inflation .",
    "quantum fluctuations of @xmath40 induce variations of the starting time of the second stage inflation , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "this translates into perturbations on the number of e - folds , @xmath51 , and therefore the curvature contrasts .",
    "it can be shown that@xcite the density contrast at the time when the curvature perturbations re - enter the horizon is related to @xmath52 by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the equation of state of the universe at reentry . from eq.([eq : n ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath55 . at horizon",
    "crossing , @xmath56 .",
    "so with the initial condition ( at @xmath57 ) @xmath58 , we find that @xmath59 .",
    "thus @xmath60 as @xmath61 is always of order unity , we see that the density perturbation can be sizable if @xmath62 is also of order unity . with an initial density contrast @xmath63 , the probability that a region of mass @xmath64 becomes a pbh is@xcite @xmath65    let us assume that the universe had inflated @xmath66 times during the second stage of inflation . from the above discussion we find@xcite @xmath67 at the end of inflation",
    "the physical scale that left the horizon during the phase transition is @xmath68 .",
    "if the second stage of inflation is short , i.e. , @xmath69 , then the energy soon after inflation may still be dominated by the oscillations of @xmath40 with @xmath70 , and the scale factor of the universe after inflation would grow as @xmath71 .",
    "the scale @xmath72 became comparable to the particle horizon ( @xmath73 ) , or @xmath74 , when @xmath75 at this time if the density contrast was @xmath76 , then bhs with size @xmath77 would form with an initial mass @xmath78 a dimensionless parameter @xmath79 is introduced to account for the dynamic range of the gravitational collapse . since @xmath80 depends on @xmath33 while @xmath62 on @xmath33 and @xmath81",
    ", the initial bh mass depends only on the mass and the coupling in the @xmath40-sector of the hybrid inflation .",
    "by identifying bhrs as dm and assuming hybrid inflation as the progenitor of pbhs , we in effect impose a constraint between @xmath80 and @xmath62 ( or equivalently , @xmath33 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "though constrained , these parameters are not so fine - tuned , as we will show in the following analysis .",
    "we wish to estimate the present abundance of the bhrs created by hybrid inflation .",
    "to do so we should track the evolution of the post - inflation pbhs through different cosmological epochs .",
    "the newly introduced  black hole epoch \" ( @xmath82 ) would in principle involve evaporation and mergers of pbhs as well as their accretion of radiation ; the details of which can be intricate . for the purpose of a rough estimate and as a good approximation , however , one is safe to neglect these detailed dynamics and only keep track of the bh evaporation throughout the bh epoch .",
    "we assume that the universe was matter dominant at the time @xmath83 when pbhs were formed . due to hawking evaporation",
    ", the universe would later become radiation dominant .",
    "since the rate of bh evaporation rises sharply in its late stage , the crossing time @xmath84 of this transition can be roughly estimated by integrating eq.(3 ) from @xmath29 to @xmath85 .",
    "this gives @xmath86 .",
    "when the hubble expansion effect is included , where the radiation density dilutes faster than the matter density by one power of the scale factor , the crossing time would be even closer to @xmath87 . for our purpose",
    ", we can simply assume that the entire bh epoch was matter dominant .    the radiation to matter density ratio at the end of bh epoch , with hubble expansion included ,",
    "can then be estimated as @xmath88 here we introduce another parameter @xmath89 to account for a range of possible minor variations of the evolution due to the dynamical details in the black hole epoch .",
    "not surprisingly , the density ratio is just roughly the initial bh mass over what remains in its remnant . as we will see below , the typical bh mass in our scenario ,",
    "while small in astrophysical sense , is nonetheless much larger than the planck mass , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the effective reheating temperature through hawking evaporation in this case would be much higher than the energy scales associated with the standard model of particle physics and baryogenesis .",
    "we thus assume that the standard cosmology would resume after the black hole epoch . to conform with the standard cosmology , our assumption that dm is predominantly contributed from bhr demands that , by the time @xmath90sec the density contributions from radiation and bhr should be about equal , namely , @xmath91 since @xmath87 is uniquely determined by the initial bh mass @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : j ] ) ) , the above condition translates into a constraint on @xmath80 and @xmath62 in hybrid inflation through eq.([eq : t ] ) : @xmath92 figure  [ bhr as dm parameter space ] shows the region in the @xmath93 parameter space that satisfies the above condition .",
    "we assume @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and let @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the allowed @xmath93 values are shown in the darkened region .",
    "we see that within the constraint that @xmath62 be of the order unity so that the metric perturbation @xmath98 be not exponentially small , there exists a wide range of @xmath80 that could produce the right amount of pbhs .    as an example , we take @xmath99 gev and @xmath100 .",
    "assume that the universe was matter - dominated when the curvature perturbation reentered the horizon .",
    "then the density contrast is @xmath101 , and the fraction of matter in the bh is @xmath102 . from eq.([eq : r ] ) , @xmath103 .",
    "so the total number of e - folds is @xmath104 .",
    "the black holes were produced at the moment @xmath105 sec , and had a typical mass @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 .",
    "then the time it took for the bhs to reduce to remnants , according to eq.([eq : j ] ) , is @xmath108 the  black hole epoch \" thus ended in time before baryogenesis and other subsequent epochs in the standard cosmology . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a post - inflation pbh evaporation provides an interesting mechanism for reheating .",
    "note that due to the continuous evaporation process and the hubble expansion , the bh reheating should result in an effective temperature which is sufficiently lower than the planck scale .",
    "our arguments for the existence of bhr based on gup is heuristic .",
    "the search for its deeper theoretical foundation is currently underway@xcite . as interactions with bhr",
    "are purely gravitational , the cross section is extremely small , and direct observation of bhr seems unlikely . one possible indirect signature may be associated with the cosmic gravitational wave background . unlike photons , the gravitons radiated during evaporation would be instantly frozen . since , according to our notion , the bh evaporation would terminate when it reduces to a bhr , the graviton spectrum should have a cutoff at planck mass .",
    "such a cutoff would have by now been redshifted to @xmath109 gev .",
    "another possible gw - related signature may be the gws released during the gravitational collapse at @xmath110 .",
    "the frequencies of such gws would by now be in the range of @xmath111 hz",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether these signals are in principle observable .",
    "another possible signature may be some imprints on the cmb fluctuations due to the thermodynamics of pbh - cmb interactions . these will be further investigated .",
