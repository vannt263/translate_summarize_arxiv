    "the palomar green ( pg ) survey has identified 1874 ultraviolet excess objects and it is estimated to be 84% complete ( green et al .  1986 ) .",
    "the luminosity function of da white dwarfs from the pg survey was determined from photometric calibrations by fleming et al .",

    "1992 ) . similarly , darling ( 1994 ) derived a luminosity function of all white dwarfs from the kiso schmidt ultraviolet excess survey ( kuv )  all spectral types included  using @xmath2 values obtained from photometric calibrations .",
    "however , the @xmath3 versus ( photographic ) color index relation used to derive the absolute visual magnitudes showed a considerable dispersion , and it is believed that the estimated @xmath2 values probably reflect a similar dispersion ( lbh05 ) .",
    "lbh05 ( see their fig .",
    "10 ) made a detailed comparison of their luminosity function with those of fleming et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and darling ( 1994 ) .",
    "they evaluate the completeness of the pg survey to 75% , while darling ( 1994 ) found a lower value of 58% . in this paper",
    ", we present preliminary results from our study aimed at improving the luminosity function by applying the spectroscopic method to the da stars in the kuv sample .",
    "one of our goals is to improve the comparison of the da luminosity functions derived from the pg and kuv samples .",
    "the kiso ultraviolet excess survey ( kuv ) is a photometric search for uv - excess objects , performed with the 105-cm schmidt telescope at kiso observatory .",
    "the 1186 objects were found in 44 fields in a belt from the northern to the southern galactic pole at a galactic longitude of @xmath4 .",
    "the fields of the survey have a mean limiting magnitude of 17.7 and cover a total area of 1400 square degrees ( noguchi et al .",
    "1980 , kondo et al .  1984 ) .",
    "we have secured optical spectroscopic observations for all white dwarfs in the kuv survey .",
    "spectra have been obtained with the steward observatory 2.3-m telescope equipped with the boller & chivens spectrograph and a loral ccd detector .",
    "the 4.5 arcsec slit together with the 600 l / mm grating in first order provided a spectral coverage of @xmath532005300 at an intermediate resolution of @xmath6    fwhm and a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 50 .",
    "we have reclassified several objects ( see table 1 ) : 30 objects from darling s sample turned out to be main sequence or subdwarf stars .",
    "our analysis also includes seven new white dwarfs that have been identified in the kuv survey since 1994 . only da stars are analyzed here , for a total of 172 white dwarfs ( including the 5 magnetic das ) .",

    "our results for the kuv sample are summarized in figure 2 in a @xmath1 vs @xmath7 diagram .",
    "absolute visual magnitudes are then calculated from evolutionary models following the prescription of holberg and bergeron ( 2006 ) .",
    "our spectroscopic @xmath2 values are compared in figure 3 with those derived by darling ( 1994 ) , which are based on empirical photometric calibrations .",
    "the differences observed are quite significant , with the empirical estimates of darling being generally fainter than the @xmath2 values determined spectroscopically .",
    "it is therefore expected that the luminosity function based on these absolute magnitudes will be affected as well .",

    "the solid lines represent carbon - core evolutionary models with thick hydrogen layers ( see lbh05 and references therein ) ; numbers on the right hand side of the figure indicate the mass of each model in solar masses . ]",
    "the luminosity function of white dwarf stars is a measure of the local density of this type of object by interval of absolute magnitude .",
    "it contains information about the history of the local galactic disk and stellar evolution .",
    "it represents also a direct measure of the space density of white dwarfs and of the stellar death rate in the local galactic disk .",
    "compared to theoretical luminosity functions , it can lead to an estimate of the age of the local galactic disk , as discussed in fontaine et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for instance .",
    "we derive the luminosity function for the da stars from the kuv survey by adding the inverse of the contribution of each star to the space density for each magnitude bin , following the well established @xmath8 method ( schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "the completeness of the sample is evaluated from the @xmath9 method described in green ( 1980 ) . using this technique ,",
    "we obtain a limiting magnitude of 17.31 for our sample of da stars .",
    "our improved luminosity function for the kuv sample based on spectroscopic determinations of @xmath2 is compared in figure 4 ( filled circles ) with the results of darling ( 1994 ) based on empirical photometric calibrations ( open circles ) .",
    "also shown is the luminosity function for the da stars from the pg survey derived by lbh05 using the same spectroscopic technique as that used in our analysis ( filled triangles ) .",
    "our results for the kuv sample are systematically larger than the pg sample in each magnitude bin , which suggests that the kuv survey is more complete than the pg survey .",
    "this is particularly true at the faint end of the luminosity function where the pg sample is known to be fairly incomplete ( lbh05 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the differences do not appear as large as previously estimated from the comparison with the results of darling ( see also lbh05 , fig .",
    "10 ) . indeed , above @xmath10",
    ", our spectroscopic determination of the luminosity function is systematically lower than that of darling .",
    "this is explained by the fact that a lot of the objects in the fainter bins in darling s analysis have been shifted to brighter magnitude bins as a result of his overestimates of the @xmath2 values ( see fig .  3 ) . we must also mention that because of our spectral reclassification ( see above ) , our sample contains fewer da white dwarfs than the original sample analyzed by darling .",
    "according to darling , the completeness of the pg survey is 58% , while the kuv survey is 75% complete .",
    "the total space density of da stars based on our analysis of the kuv sample is @xmath11 pc@xmath12 .",
    "lbh05 obtained for the pg survey a value of @xmath13 pc@xmath12 for da white dwarfs with @xmath14 . for the same range of @xmath2 , we derive a value of @xmath15 pc@xmath12 , i.e.  a space density @xmath16 times larger .",
    "the next step in our analysis will be to include the db stars observed in our survey to improve our determination of the complete luminosity function of white dwarf stars .",
