    "presently we are very close to complete a stereoscopic system consisting of 5 imaging telescopes ( reported by g.hermann and m.ulrich at this symposium ) which during the next several years will serve as one of the most powerful instruments in the field , operating at energies above 500  gev @xcite .",
    "the multi mirror reflector of each telescope ( fig . [ telescop ] ) has an area @xmath6 .",
    "the 60  cm diameter front aluminized and quartz coated spherical glass mirrors with a focal length of about 5  m are independently mounted on an almost spherical frame of an alt - azimuth mount .",
    "the angular resolution of the reflector is better than 10 the mount is driven by two stepping motors , and controlled by shaft encoders which provide a tracking accuracy of @xmath7 .",
    "each telescope is equipped with a 271-channel camera @xcite consisting of a close - packed cluster of circular pmts ( emi  9083 kafl ) faced with hollow hexagonal - to - round light guides ( fig  [ camera ] ) .",
    "the diameter of a pixel is about @xmath8 , which results in the telescope s field of view fov@xmath9 .",
    "the photon to photoelectron conversion efficiency including all kinds of losses ( due to the mirror reflectivity , the quantum efficiency of pmts , losses in light guides , _ etc . _ ) , and averaged over the spectrum of the cherenkov light at the level of observations , is around @xmath10 .    the entire electronics , including the trigger , readout , and the telescope control , is based on the vme standard . the digitization of the pmt pulses is performed with a flash adc system which allows to reconstruct the shape and time distribution of the pulses .",
    "the trigger decision is taken on two levels @xcite .",
    "the fast trigger requires a minimum number of pixels to be fired , and the second ( slower ) level restricts the topology of an image . near each telescope",
    "there is a small hut which houses the local electronics .",
    "each telescope is equipped with a local cpu which communicates via an ethernet line with the central computer .",
    "although each telescope is built as stand alone detector , all telescopes can be integrated into the system by software command through the central computer ( pentium pc ) .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 5.5 cm    the first nominal ` system - telescope ' called ( for chronological reasons ) ct-3 , is in operation since august 1995 .",
    "the data taken in the 95/96 season generally confirm the expected performance of a single telescope .",
    "the next 3 telescopes ct-4 , ct-5 , and ct-6 have been installed , tested and calibrated during july - december 1996 , and are now operating together with ct-3 as a system in the 2-fold coincidence mode .",
    "the preliminary results are very encouraging and already demonstrate the power of the stereoscopic approach ( see below ) .",
    "currently , we use different fadc systems in different telescopes , but in the near future ( until march 1997 ) we plan to operate the above four telescopes with the 120  mhz fadc system . at approximately the same time",
    "we plan to replace the present 61-channel ( pixel size @xmath11 , and fov@xmath12 ) camera of ct-2 by a standard 271-pixel high resolution camera .",
    "thus we hope that after the test and calibration work , we will be able to run in the second half of 1997 the whole system as a very sensitive instrument for deep study of vhe @xmath0-rays in the energy region 0.5 - 10  tev .",
    "in addition we plan to upgrade the first ( prototype ) hegra telescope ct-1 .",
    "this equatorial mount telescope with @xmath13 reflector was installed and is taking data since 1992 @xcite . in 1994 the original 37-channel camera was replaced by a new high resolution 127-channel camera ( pixel size @xmath8 ) based on the same pixels used in the ` system ' telescopes , but designed in the camac standard @xcite . in 1997 the round glass mirrors will be replaced by light hexagonal aluminum mirrors with a total reflector area @xmath14 .",
    "thus the energy threshold of the telescope will be reduced to 500  gev .",
    "we plan to use this telescope for individual observational programs , especially in immediate reaction to potential vhe @xmath0-ray emitters showing flaring activity in other wavelengths . at the same time",
    "this telescope being located very near to the central telescope ct-3 , can be effectively integrated , if necessary , with other iacts in order to set up 2 or 3 independent stereoscopic iact systems for simultaneous observations of different sources .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 5.5 cm      although @xmath0-ray showers of energy @xmath15 with core position within 100  m from the telescope produce @xmath16 photoelectrons in the camera , sufficient for proper image analysis , the energy threshold of a single telescope is somewhat larger , and is determined by the suppression efficiency of the night sky background ( n.s.b . ) at the trigger level .",
    "the hardware trigger criterion for each telescope , optimized by monte carlo calculations , is organized such that the signals in at least 2 neighboring pixels from the inner 169 pixels should exceed @xmath17 photoelectrons ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the monte carlo calculations of the detection rates of @xmath0-rays from a point source , presented in fig . [ rates ] , show that the effective energy threshold of the telescope ct-3 is between 700  gev and 1  tev , depending on the slope of the primary photon spectrum .",
    "the first observations with ct-3 generally confirm the calculated performance of a single telescope , namely , a detection rate of @xmath0-rays from the crab nebula above 700  gev of about @xmath19 on top of a cosmic ray ( cr ) detection rate @xmath20 , the significance of the signal per 1 hour of observations being @xmath21 .",
    "= 6 cm = 6 cm    = 6.5 cm = 7 .",
    "cm    the requirement of simultaneous detection of showers by locally triggered @xmath22 telescopes significantly reduces the effect of the n.s.b . as well as that of the another important background connected with local muons .",
    "this allows a lower energy threshold of the system down to @xmath23 .",
    "also , the ability of the system to analyze the cherenkov images in different projections where the images are only partially correlated , provides a superior rejection of hadronic showers . the preliminary results of observations of the crab nebula in october  96 by ct3/ct4/ct5",
    ", operating in the 2-fold telescope coincidence mode , generally confirm this prediction . in fig .",
    "[ system ] we present the on - source and off - source alpha distributions for the crab in the camera of , obtained after filtering the events through the ` standard ' image cuts of the showers detected by @xmath22 telescopes .",
    "this preliminary result shows that the significance of detection of @xmath24 @xmath0-rays from the crab is achieved at a level of @xmath25 per 1 hour .",
    "in fact , we expect further significant improvement of the signal using _ energy _ and _ distance _ dependent ` cuts ' to the detected images .",
    "( note that the stereoscopic approach allows to determine the energy and the distance to the shower core with accuracies @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , the obvious advantage of the joint operation of @xmath22 telescopes is the possibility to determine , without any _ a priory _ assumption , the arrival directions of _ individual _",
    "@xmath0-ray primaries with accuracy @xmath28 .",
    "for the case of point - like sources , this provides by itself , rejection of the cr background based only on the orientational characteristics of showers by a factor of at least several 100 .",
    "the procedure obviously requires good understanding of the characteristics of all telescopes linked in the system .",
    "although the work regarding the ct3/ct4/ct5 data set is still in progress , our results obtained earlier using the combination of telescopes ct1/ct2 @xcite , and telescopes ct2/ct3 allows us an optimistic view concerning the practical realization of this important aspect of the stereoscopic approach . indeed , despite the short time of simultaneous observations from the crab by ct-2 and ct-3 taken during the season 1995/1996 and a low coincidence rate ( due to the high energy threshold of ct-2 ) , the stereoscopic approach reveals a clear signal with 23 ` excess ' events against 4 ( ! ) ` background ' events within an angle @xmath29 around the direction to the crab ( see fig . [ stereo ] ) , the latter being in good agreement with the monte carlo predictions for the angular resolution of the ct2/ct3 system .",
    "= 8 cm = 4 cm    thus , our current understanding of the system based on the recent experimental results as well as on comprehensive monte carlo studies , allows us to make conclusive predictions for the performance of the system of the 5 hegra imaging telescopes , namely    @xmath30 energy threshold around 500  gev ;    @xmath30 angular and energy resolutions of about @xmath31 and @xmath26 , respectively ;    @xmath30 minimum detectable fluxes of @xmath0-rays @xmath32 from point sources , and @xmath33 from moderately extended sources with an angular size @xmath34 .      while the 5-iact system is nearing the final stage of its commission , we continue to use the available telescopes in different configurations not only for methodological purposes , but also for observations of a number of astronomical objects .",
    "the first positive signal of @xmath0-rays was seen from the crab nebula in 1992 by ct-1 in its first version @xcite .",
    "later we have detected tev @xmath0-rays from the crab with a significance of @xmath35 using ct-2 @xcite .",
    "the current sensitivity of the system consisting of ct3/ct4/ct5 has achieved a level which allows to obtain a strong signal from the crab for just a few hours of observations under almost background - free conditions ( see fig . [ system ] ) .",
    "thus , we can now use the high energy photon beam of this persistent source for calibration purposes and for an understanding of detector characteristics .    over the last several years",

    "however , the observations of markarian  421 in 1995 resulted in the independent detection of statistically significant positive signals by ct-1 and ct-2 @xcite , thus confirming the discovery by the whipple collaboration of tev emission from this bl lac object @xcite .",

    "however , the observations by the same telescopes after aug 15 with doubled exposition time did not reveal any indication of a signal .",
    "since this might be a result of a highly sporadic behavior of grs  1915 + 105 , we decided to continue observations in 1996 .    in 1996",
    "grs  1915 + 105 has been observed during the period may - july 1996 by ct2 and ct3 .",
    "ct2 with an energy threshold @xmath38 had been successfully used earlier for observations of the crab @xcite and mrk  421 @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of this telescope are studied by monte carlo simulations which reproduce quite well the distributions of different image parameters .",
    "the rejection power of the telescope based on both _",
    "shape _ and _ orientation _ parameters allows to suppress the cr background by a factor of 100 , the @xmath0-ray acceptance being at the level of @xmath39 .",
    "the sensitivity of the telescope based on the observations of the crab nebula is estimated as @xmath40 detection rate of a signal from a point source at the flux level @xmath41 .",
    "remarkably , this parameter has not been changed noticeably during the last 2 years which demonstrates the high stability of operation of the telescope .",
    "since grs  1915 + 105 is a highly variable object , we observed the source in the tracking mode .",
    "in addition , each month certain on / off pairs were taken in order to monitor the shape of the background `` @xmath42-distribution '' .",

    "the alpha - distribution of on - off source events shown in fig .",

    "the average rate of excess events is @xmath45 which corresponds to @xmath46 of the @xmath0-ray detection from the crab .",
    "note that most of the `` excess '' events are due to the june period of observations which can be explained by @xmath47 of statistics contained in this period . at the same time ,",
    "perhaps one can not exclude an intrinsic variability of the signal itself .",
    "for example the statistical significance of the signal in june 19 alone is of about @xmath48 , with a rate exceeding the average rate by a factor of 3 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ grsd ] where we present the daily rates of the `` excess '' events .",
    "another feature of the time profile of the rate is its rather interesting coincidence with 3 prominent few - day - duration flares of grs  1915 + 105 detected in radio and x - rays ( see fig .",
    "[ grsd ] ) .",
    "this possible correlation in time of the rate of `` excess '' events may serve as an additional argument that strengthens the belief that the tev @xmath0-ray detection from this source is a real effect rather than a result of statistical fluctuation of the background .",
    "if so , assuming that the radiation originates in the jet of grs  1915 + 105 approaching us , the intrinsic average tev luminosity of the source is estimated as @xmath49 .",
    "= 8 cm = 4.3 cm    however , we would like to emphasize that before going too far in the astrophysical interpretation of this statistically marginal signal , we obviously need independent confirmations of this result by other instruments and groups . as was mentioned before ,",
    "the source was observed simultaneously also by the ct-3 telescope . at the perpignan symposium ,",
    "a positive signal was also shown from this telescope .",
    "further analysis of these data however has revealed evidence for hardware problems during this observation period in some of the camera pixels , resulting in large spurious signals , which may fake @xmath0-ray topologies .",
    "work is in progress to correct these problems in software and to reprocess the data . at this point ,",
    "no statements concerning grs  1915 + 105 signals in ct-3 data can be made .",
    "in an analysis using monte carlo and experimental data it has been shown that the angular resolution of the airobicc array above a threshold of 18 tev for all events inside the array border is @xmath50 = 0.29 @xmath51 .",
    "it decreases to 0.1 @xmath51 at higher energies .",
    "the corresponding angular resolution of the scintillator array above 20 tev is @xmath50 = 0.9@xmath51 and reaches at higher energies 0.4 @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "the separation of gamma- and hadron - initiated showers is , besides a good angular resolution , crucial for a search of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the method called pearl uses first the well know fact that electromagnetic showers decline after the shower maximum faster than hadronic showers .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath52/ of particles measured at ground @xmath53 and the number of cherenkov photons is a well known separation quantity @xcite .",
    "the other newly introduced quantity in the method pearl is related to the larger transverse extent of hadronic showers as compared to electromagnetic showers due to the hadronic transverse momentum arising in hadronic interactions .",
    "the quantity used for the transverse spread is defined by @xmath54 / @xmath55 whereby @xmath56 is the reconstructed core position , @xmath57 the position of the @xmath58 scintillator counter and @xmath59 the number of particles in the @xmath58 scintillator counter .",
    "the separation quantity @xmath60 is related to the age parameter from a nkg fit .    instead of using quantities obtained from a fit to the lateral distributions the method pearl uses the corresponding quantities derived from counting the amplitudes in the different counters i.e. the sum of the pulseheights in the scintillators n(e),the sum of the cherenkovlight measured in the airobicc array n(l ) , and the quantity @xmath61 sensitive to the lateral extent defined above .",
    "the advantage of these quantities is that showers at the trigger threshold can be analysed without requiring a fit to converge .",
    "( studies have shown that for showers for which the lateral fits converge the results are the same in the energy range of interest ) .    in fig .",
    "[ pearl ] the two separation quantities are plotted against each other for photon and hadron initiated showers .",
    "a clear distinction can be seen and a straight line ( pearl cut ) can be used to separate photon- and hadron initiated shower in the 2-dim logarithmic plot . the q factor defined as / obtained for this method varies from q=1.5 at threshold of 18 tev to q=2.5 at 50 tev .      with the gamma - hadron separation method pearl described above , based on the scintillator and airobicc arrays , a search for galactic sources has been performed using the 94/95 data . amongst 13 selected sources the most significant excess of 3.3 @xmath62 after gamma - hadron separation is observed for her x-1 .",
    "no excess has been observed for the crab nebula in the 93/95 data whereas in the 1992/93 data a 3.6 @xmath62 effect has been reported ( @xmath63 icrc rom 1995 , unpublished ) . the results for the crab nebula are summarized in fig .",

    "whereas with the iact only one source at a time can be observed , the arrays allow a simultaneous observation of several sources in the field of view of hegra , however for the prize of a higher energy threshold .",
