    "more precisely , the decomposition of @xmath9 into irreducible representations of @xmath10 is independent of @xmath8 for @xmath11 , when one appropriately identifies irreducibles of @xmath10 with a subset of those for @xmath12 .    given this observation , one may wonder if the same phenomenon holds true more generally .",
    "that is , suppose that for each @xmath13 we have a finitely generated @xmath10-equivariant @xmath0-module @xmath14 such that the @xmath15 are `` compatible '' in an appropriate sense .",
    "do the resolutions of the @xmath14 stabilize ?",
    "the main result of this paper ( theorem  [ mainthm ] ) implies that the answer to this question is `` yes . ''",
    "in fact , theorem  [ mainthm ] establishes a more fundamental result : compatible sequences of finitely generated equivariant @xmath0-modules are `` noetherian '' in an appropriate sense .      instead of working with a compatible sequence of @xmath0-modules ,",
    "we prefer to pass to the limit in @xmath8 and work with a single module over the ring @xmath16 .",
    "this ring , with its @xmath17 action , is an example of a * twisted commutative algebra ( tca ) * ; see  [ sec : defn ] for the general definition . given a tca @xmath18 ,",
    "there is a notion of ( finitely generated ) @xmath18-module , and @xmath18 is said to be * noetherian * if any submodule of a finitely generated @xmath18-module is again finitely generated .",
    "our main result is the following theorem :    [ mainthm ] the tca s @xmath16 and @xmath19 are noetherian .",

    "this is reminiscent of the noetherianity result for @xmath29-modules ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "there are analogous reinterpretations for the other two cases .",
    "we offer a few pieces of motivation for our work .",

    "[ mainthm ] and  [ mainthm2 ] are closely related to the representation theory of orthogonal and symplectic groups ; for example , see @xcite or example  [ ex : brauer ] below .",
    "we believe our theorems will have useful applications in this area .",
    "* the tca s we consider provide important new additions to the growing list of large noetherian algebraic structures ; see  [ ss : connection ] for further discussion .",
    "* @xmath22-modules are formally very similar to the @xmath30-modules studied in @xcite .",
    "numerous examples of @xmath30-modules have been found , and the noetherian property for @xmath30-modules often translates to interesting new theorems about the examples ( e.g. , representation stability in the cohomology of configuration spaces ) .",
    "we do not currently have analogous examples of @xmath22-modules , but when examples are found ( which we expect ) , theorem  [ mainthm ] will yield interesting new results about them .    [",
    "ex : brauer ] for @xmath31 define the * brauer category * @xmath32 as follows : objects are finite sets , and morphisms are brauer diagrams , where composition of brauer diagrams uses the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "one can regard @xmath22 as a subcategory of @xmath32 , and from this one can deduce noetherianity of @xmath32-modules from theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 with integers @xmath8 and @xmath35 .",
    "then one obtains an interesting @xmath32-module by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the super vector space of the indicated super dimension .",
    "this module is closely connected to the representation theory of the orthosymplectic lie algebra @xmath38 .",
    "our theorem shows that any submodule of this module is finitely generated . the second and third author plan to study @xmath32-modules more closely in a future paper , and",
    "the noetherian property will be of foundational importance .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm ] fits into a theme that has emerged in recent years where large algebraic structures have been found to be noetherian .",
    "see @xcite for examples of @xmath39-equivariant polynomial rings .",
    "some other examples include @xmath40-modules @xcite , @xmath30-modules @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath41-modules @xcite , @xmath42-modules @xcite , and certain spaces of infinite matrices @xcite .",
    "however , the noetherian results of this paper seem fundamentally more difficult than the previous ones .",
    "we do not know how to make this observation precise , but offer the following observation .",
    "one can almost always use grbner bases to reduce a noetherianity problem in algebra to one in combinatorics ( see @xcite ) . in the previous noetherianity results",
    ", the combinatorial problems ultimately concern words in a formal language , and can be easily solved using higman s lemma .",
    "in contrast , the combinatorial problem that naturally arises in the present case ( question  [ ques : grobner ] ) is graph - theoretic , and does not seem approachable by higman s lemma . alternatively , this division can be seen in terms of the asymptotics of hilbert functions : in the previous noetherian results , the hilbert functions have exponential growth , while in the present case the growth is super - exponential .    due to this fundamental new difficulty , we have been forced to introduce new methods to prove the main theorem .",
    "we believe these will be useful more generally .",
    "we now outline the proof of noetherianity for @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 and let @xmath45 be the category of torsion @xmath18-modules , where we say that an @xmath18-module @xmath46 is torsion if @xmath47 . if @xmath48 is a non - zero ideal of @xmath18 then the quotient tca @xmath49 is `` essentially bounded , '' and it is not difficult to conclude from this that @xmath49 is noetherian ( see proposition  [ prop : eb ] ) ; it follows that finitely generated objects of @xmath45 are noetherian .",
    "we next consider the serre quotient category @xmath50 , which we denote by @xmath51 .",
    "the intuition for @xmath51 comes from the following picture , which is not rigorous :    2em the scheme @xmath52 is the space of symmetric bilinear forms on @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath18-modules correspond to @xmath17-equivariant quasi - coherent sheaves on @xmath52 .",
    "torsion @xmath18-modules correspond to sheaves that restrict to zero on the open set @xmath54 of non - degenerate forms .",
    "thus objects of @xmath51 correspond to equivariant quasi - coherent sheaves on @xmath54 .",
    "but such sheaves correspond to representations of @xmath55 , since @xmath17 acts transitively on @xmath54 with stabilizer @xmath55 .",
    "the above reasoning is fraught with errors .",
    "nonetheless , it leads to a correct statement : we prove ( theorem  [ thm : modk - equiv ] ) that @xmath51 is equivalent to the category of algebraic representations of @xmath55 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite can therefore be transferred to @xmath51 , and give an essentially complete understanding of this category .",
    "we would now like to piece together what we know about @xmath45 and @xmath51 to deduce the noetherianity of @xmath18 .",
    "however , the noetherianity of @xmath18 is not a formal consequence of what we have so far : we need to use more information about _ how _",
    "@xmath56 is built out of the two pieces @xmath45 and @xmath51 .",
    "we proceed in three steps .    1 .",
    "we show that if @xmath46 is a finitely generated torsion @xmath18-module then @xmath46 admits a resolution by finitely generated projective @xmath18-modules ( proposition  [ prop : tors - ft ] ) .",
    "the essential input here is @xcite , which explicitly computes the resolutions of certain torsion modules",
    "we next show that the section functor @xmath57 , defined as the right adjoint of the localization functor @xmath58 , takes finite length objects of @xmath51 to finitely generated objects of @xmath56 .",
    "this follows from step ( 1 ) and the structural results for @xmath51 ( see proposition  [ prop : s - fin ] ) .",
    "finally , the noetherianity of @xmath18 is deduced from ( 2 ) , and our knowledge of @xmath45 and @xmath51 , by a short argument ( see theorem  [ thm : a - noeth ] ) .    [",
    "rmk : pfctx ] let us offer some broader context for this proof .",
    "suppose that @xmath59 is a scheme equipped with an action of a group @xmath60 .",
    "we say that @xmath59 is * topologically @xmath60-noetherian * if every descending chain of @xmath60-stable zariski closed subsets in @xmath59 stabilizes .",
    "we say that @xmath59 is * ( scheme - theoretically ) @xmath60-noetherian * if the analogous statement holds for subschemes - equivariant coherent sheaves are noetherian , not just the structure sheaf . ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath54 is a @xmath60-stable open subscheme of @xmath59 , and let @xmath61 be the complement of @xmath54 .",
    "one would then like to relate the noetherianity of @xmath59 to that of @xmath54 and @xmath61 .    for topological noetherianity",
    ", there is no problem : if @xmath54 and @xmath61 are topologically @xmath60-noetherian then so is @xmath59 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is a fundamental tool used in various topological noetherianity results , such as @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the analogous statement for scheme - theoretic @xmath60-noetherianity does not hold : this is why we can not directly conclude the noetherianity of @xmath18 from that of @xmath45 and @xmath51 .",
    "the main technical innovation in this paper is our method for deducing ( in our specific situation ) scheme - theoretic noetherianity of @xmath59 from that of @xmath54 and @xmath61 , together with some extra information .",
    "this approach is likely to be applicable in other situations , and could be very useful : for instance , if one could upgrade the topological results of @xcite to scheme - theoretic results , it is likely that one could also get finiteness results for higher syzygies in addition to results about equations ( and not just set - theoretic equations ) .      one can define a notion of twisted graded - commutative algebra , the basic examples being exterior algebras on finite length polynomial representations of @xmath17 .",
    "the noetherianity problem for these algebras is interesting , and has applications similar to the commutative case .",
    "transpose duality interchanges the algebras @xmath21 and @xmath62 , and so noetherianity of the latter is an immediate consequence of theorem  [ mainthm2 ] .",
    "however , the noetherianity of @xmath63 and @xmath64 can not be formally deduced from the results of this paper .",
    "we treat these algebras in a follow - up paper @xcite .",
    "the main ideas are the same , but the details are more complicated : for example , while @xmath16 is closely related to the orthogonal group @xmath55 , the algebra @xmath63 is closely related to the periplectic superalgebra @xmath65 .",

    "it would be natural to generalize this result by allowing @xmath67 to be a finite length representation of degree @xmath68 .",
    "eggermont @xcite has shown that these tca s are topologically noetherian ( i.e. , radical ideals satisfy the ascending chain condition ) .",
    "this suggests that they are all noetherian . however , new ideas are needed to actually prove this",
    "it is desirable to have results ( either positive or negative ) when @xmath67 has degree @xmath69 .",
    "one might begin by trying to prove topological noetherianity for degree  3 representations .",
    "the third author is currently investigating this with h.  derksen and r.  eggermont .",
    "3 .   are the characteristic @xmath70 analogs of the tca s considered in this paper noetherian ?",
    "our methods do not apply there .",
    "we point out that there are two versions of tca s in positive characteristic : one defined in terms of polynomial representations , and one defined in terms of symmetric groups .",

    "* example  2.4 ) .",
    "what happens for other groups ?",
    "is @xmath18 noetherian with respect to @xmath55 or @xmath72 ? 5 .",
    "in  [ ss : ft ] , we show that torsion modules over @xmath21 satisfy the property ( ft ) by appealing to @xcite , which explicitly computes the resolutions of certain torsion modules .",
    "we also show that torsion modules over @xmath16 satisfy ( ft ) , but deduce this by a rather clumsy argument from the previous case since the analog of @xcite is not known in this case .",
    "we therefore believe that carrying out the analog of @xcite for @xmath16 would be a worthwhile undertaking .",
