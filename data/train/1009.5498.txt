    "rr lyrae variables have great astrophysical importance for they are tracers of stellar evolution , they are used as distance indicators and they are test objects of stellar pulsation theories . we think that these objects are known fairly well . they are pure radial pulsators oscillating in fundamental mode , in first overtone and , in some cases , in both .",
    "there is , however , a flaw in this nice picture : the so - called blazhko effect @xcite , the periodic variation of the light - curve shape of some of the rr lyrae stars .",
    "although the phenomenon has been known for more than a century , its physical origin is still unknown .",
    "recently , it has been found that a much larger percentage of the rr lyrae stars exhibit light - curve modulation than it was previously assumed @xcite , which makes the problem even more embarrassing .",
    "to explain the light - curve modulation , several models have been put forward during the past decades , but none of them is able to reproduce most of the observed properties of the modulation .",
    "the oblique magnetic rotator models @xcite are based on the presumption of a bipolar magnetic field with a magnetic axis oblique to the axis of rotation .",
    "the resonance models @xcite explain the modulation with the excitation of non - radial modes of low radial degree . according to the model proposed by @xcite , a turbulent dynamo in the envelope triggers the light - curve modulation .",
    "the analysis of the 127-d - long quasi - continuous @xmath4 data raised the possibility that a 9:2 radial - overtone  fundamental - mode resonance might be connected to the blazhko phenomenon @xcite .    to find the physical explanation for the blazhko effect",
    ", we have to know how it manifests itself in the observed properties , i.e. detailed observations of blazhko stars are needed .",
    "therefore , we launched the konkoly blazhko survey in 2004 @xcite , which aimed at collecting extended , accurate , multicolour photometric data of blazhko stars . in this paper",
    ", we report the results on cz  lacertae , one of the most intriguing target of our survey .",
    "cz  lac ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) is a bright , short - period , fundamental - mode rr  lyrae - type ( rrab ) variable in the northern sky discovered by @xcite .",
    "no photometric study of cz  lac has been published yet .",
    ".log of the ccd observations of cz  lac obtained with the 60-cm automatic telescope .",
    "note that , due to technical problems , observations were not obtained in each band on 10 nights in the second observing season .",
    "[ tbl : obslog ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +      after determining the mass , the distance and the interstellar reddening of cz  lac , the ipm were run for the data of different phases of the modulations , keeping these parameters fixed during the fitting process . in this way",
    ", the changes in radius , luminosity and temperature with blazhko phase were obtained for both modulations in the two observing seasons .",
    "the synthetic light curves of both modulations were divided into 20 blazhko - phase bins of equal width .",
    "these data showed practically no light - curve modulation in any of the bins .",
    "the light curves of the modulation phase bins were then fitted with the harmonics of the pulsation frequency .",
    "these fits were used as the input for the ipm .",
    "the results , the pulsation - phase - dependent output parameters of the ipm were averaged for the whole pulsation cycle , i. e. their arithmetic means were calculated in order to detect any blazhko - phase - dependent changes . at this stage , eight different internal settings of the ipm were used to estimate the uncertainties of the results .",
    "the choices of the @xmath8 template curves and their weights during the fitting process were the same that we had used in our earlier analyses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we used two different @xmath9@xmath10 relations ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mean values of the observational data , derived from the photometry , and the results of the ipm are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ipres ] for both modulations in both seasons . in the left - hand panels , the observed mean",
    "quantities are plotted as a function of blazhko phase : the peak - to - peak pulsation amplitude in @xmath11 band , the variation of the pulsation period calculated from the phase variation of the @xmath12 pulsation - frequency , and the different pulsation averages of the magnitudes and colours .",
    "the right - hand panels show the quantities derived by the ipm for each blazhko phase : the pulsation - averaged mean values of the radius , the surface gravity , the absolute visual brightness averaged by magnitude and intensity units , the luminosity and the effective temperature . in full accordance with our previous findings @xcite ,",
    "the actual values of the fixed parameters had an influence only on the average values of those physical parameters that changed with blazhko phase , and had no effect on their changes around the averages .    as the amplitudes of both modulations decreased from the first season to the next , the amplitudes of the changes in most of the derived parameters decreased , too .",
    "although the two modulations had rather different characteristics , apart from the reduced amplitudes , their behaviour remained the same from the first season to the second .",
    "the consistency of the ipm results for the two modulations in the different seasons is a strong argument for the reliability of the method .",
    "taking into account that the input data of the ipm are completely independent for the two seasons , such a consistent result can hardly be explained by any artefact .    in accordance with our previous results @xcite ,",
    "the intensity - averaged mean @xmath11 brightness reflects the mean luminosity changes of cz  lac very well .",
    "the luminosity is always the highest at the high - amplitude blazhko phases .",
    "the luminosity variations connected to the first modulation ( @xmath13 ) are caused predominantly by temperature changes in both seasons .",
    "the radius changes corresponding to this modulation component are very small and are in anti - correlation with the luminosity variations . at the same time",
    ", the luminosity changes connected to the second modulation ( @xmath14 ) are induced mainly by radius changes in both seasons .",
    "the small temperature changes with this modulation are out of phase in the first season and are the opposite of the luminosity variations in the second season .",
    "the strength of the phase ( period ) modulations seems to have no influence on the strength of any of the detected variations of the parameters .",
    "multi - periodic modulation has already been found in some blazhko rr  lyr stars @xcite . however , one of the modulations was always dominant , with much higher amplitude than the other , in these stars .",
    "cz  lac is the first multi - periodically modulated rr  lyrae star with two modulations of similar strength .",
    "the good phase coverage of our multicolour ccd observations made it possible to study the nature of the multi - periodic modulation of cz lac in detail .",
    "the analysis of the data from two consecutive observing seasons revealed that the fourier spectra of the light curves showed complex multiplet structures around the pulsation harmonics ; frequencies at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 were detected .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of the multi - periodic modulation of cz lac was that , similarly to multi - mode pulsation , combination terms of the modulations also appeared in the spectra .",
    "modulation peaks with separations of half the @xmath14 frequency and linear combination terms involving this component [ @xmath22 and @xmath23 were also identified .",
    "no similar frequency component has ever been detected in any other blazhko star .",
    "no additional frequency at @xmath24 separation has been reported even in the high - precision @xmath25 and @xmath4 space missions data @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath26 components makes the interpretation of the spectrum rather difficult .",
    "taking also into account that modulation periods of 130  d and about its half , 67  d were detected at different epochs in one of the rrab stars ( v2 ) in the globular cluster m5 @xcite , one might have some doubt whether @xmath14 or its half is the true base frequency of this modulation .",
    "the modulation properties of cz  lac changed significantly between the two observing seasons , while only very slight changes were detected in the mean pulsation properties .",
    "the periods of the two modulations changed in opposite directions : @xmath27 increased from 18.5 to 18.7  d , while @xmath28 decreased form 14.8 to 14.4  d. the amplitudes of both modulations decreased significantly from the first observing season to the next , and their relative strength reversed .",
    "the period and the @xmath11 amplitude of the mean pulsation light curve decreased by @xmath29  d and 0.015  mag , respectively .",
    "all the detected changes took place within a 237-d - long interval , as there was no sign of any frequency or amplitude change in the individual seasons data .",
    "the two modulation frequencies of cz lac were in a 5:4 resonance ratio well within the error limit in the first observing season .",
    "the modulation frequencies changed to the second season so that they were close to the 4:3 resonance then , but the frequency ratio differed somewhat from the exact resonance value .",
    "the sudden transition from a 5:4 resonance to a near 4:3 resonance between the two seasons hints that the two modulations prefer to be in resonance and their frequencies are not fully independent .",
    "however , the strong , opposite period changes of the components have made it impossible to describe the light - curve variations of cz  lac uniformly with a single base - modulation frequency in the two seasons .",
    "there is another example of a blazhko star ( v14 in m5 ) with modulation periods in 4:3 resonance @xcite .",
    "however , the modulations with the different periods were not coincidental , they were observed at different epochs in this star .",
    "these observations suggest that the detected modulation periods of blazhko stars may not be unique , which makes the interpretation of the phenomenon even more difficult .",
    "changes in the physical parameters of cz  lac were determined by the inverse photometric method @xcite .",
    "no changes in the mean parameters were derived for the two consecutive seasons in accordance with the constancy of the mean colours and magnitudes during the whole two - years observations .",
    "small changes in the mean effective temperature ( @xmath30 ) , mean luminosity ( @xmath31 ) and mean radius ( @xmath32 ) with the phases of both modulations were unambiguously detected .",
    "the relations between the physical - parameter variations were different for the two modulations in both seasons .",
    "although the large - amplitude phases of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 corresponded to 13  per  cent increased mean luminosity values , these luminosity changes were induced by either temperature or radius changes connected to one and the other modulations .",
    "this pattern remained unchanged from the first season to the next .",
    "taking into account the independence of the input data ( observations of the two seasons ) and their separate analysis , such stability of the results confirms that the detected changes are real .",
    "cz lac is an example for modulations of different character showing up simultaneously in a single star .",
    "consequently , it seems that the stellar structure and parameters do not directly determine how the mean physical parameters vary with the blazhko cycle .",
    "this fact may explain why no generally valid relation between pulsation and modulation properties of blazhko stars has been revealed in spite of the efforts for establishing such a connection .",
    "the phase relation between the pulsation - period and -amplitude variations during the blazhko cycle should be an important parameter of the modulation according to the model of @xcite .",
    "examining these phase relations of the stars studied so far in the konkoly blazhko survey and the data of the two modulations of cz  lac , we have not found any connection between these properties and any of the observed and derived ( by the ipm ) parameters of the modulation .",
    "the only regularity that have been disclosed is that , in all the studied cases , the changes in the mean luminosity are always parallel to the amplitude variations of the pulsation , i.e. blazhko stars are always slightly more luminous at their large - amplitude phase than at their small - amplitude phase .",
    "the investigation of the long - term period changes using @xmath0 data showed that the pulsation period of cz  lac underwent a significant decrease just around the time of our ccd observations in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "linear fits to the @xmath0 data for the 19902005.5 and 2005.52010 intervals yielded pulsation periods of 0.432183 and 0.432138  d , respectively .",
    "the ccd observations revealed that the pulsation - period change was not abrupt , but lasted for several years .",
    "the konkoly ccd observations were made serendipitously at the time when the drastic period decrease started .",
    "our data showed that the modulation properties ( periods and amplitudes ) changed significantly in 20042005 , when the drastic pulsation - period decrease of cz  lac just began .",
    "all these changes were presumably triggered by structural changes in the stellar interior .",
    "the strong variations observed in the modulation properties implied that the modulation was more sensitive to the changes in the interior and/or followed these changes more quickly than the properties of the pulsation . a similar , significant period change ( an increase , however ) occurred in rr  gem ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) around 1938 , which was also accompanied by drastic changes in the modulation properties .",
    "cz  lac is the first blazhko rr  lyrae star that showed two different modulations simultaneously with amplitudes of about equal strengths .",
    "if the two modulations are indeed independent of each other , then it contradicts any explanation of the blazhko effect that connect the modulation period to the rotation of the star .",
