    "<S> we perform an accurate test of ultrametricity in the aging dynamics of the three dimensional edwards - anderson spin glass . </S>",
    "<S> our method consists in considering the evolution in parallel of two identical systems constrained to have fixed overlap . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be a particularly efficient way to study the geometrical relations between configurations at distant large times . </S>",
    "<S> our findings strongly hint towards dynamical ultrametricity in spin glasses , while this is absent in simpler aging systems with domain growth dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a recently developed theory of linear response in glassy systems allows to infer that dynamical ultrametricity implies the same property at the level of equilibrium states .    2    the dispute about the nature of the spin glass phase of finite dimensional spin glasses </S>",
    "<S> has lasted by now almost twenty years , after that the droplet model  @xcite has challenged the predictions of mean field theory ( mft )  @xcite .    in the last years a large collection of numerical data have tested , with positive answer , the applicability of spin glass mean field picture to finite dimensional ( @xmath0=3,4 ) systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however some of these numerical evidences have been recently re - interpreted as finite volume effects by the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and so many questions on the low - temperature phase of finite dimensional spin glasses still remain unaswered .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most characteristic aspects of mean field theory is the prediction of ultrametricity ( um )  @xcite . at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> the ergodicity is broken and many low free energy states are present . </S>",
    "<S> ultrametricity implies that the distances between these states verify an inequality stronger than the triangular one ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> however this property has been rather elusive to a direct probe . </S>",
    "<S> the best evidences in favor of this property have been given ( to our knowledge ) in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the former </S>",
    "<S> it was studied the equilibrium of a 4@xmath0 spin glass model using small samples . in the latter very - low - energy configurations of a 3@xmath0 model </S>",
    "<S> were used , again for relatively small samples . in both cases an extrapolation to large volumes was needed in order to check ultrametricity . in this paper we present results for the 3@xmath0 spin glass model with a method that allows us to reach much larger sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> another fundamental aspect of mft is the prediction of slow dynamics and aging  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non stationary asymptotic regime , following a quench from a high temperature , which persists forever in infinite systems . in this out - of - equilibrium regime </S>",
    "<S> , the equilibrium property of ultrametricity has a dynamical counterpart in ultrametric relations among time dependent autocorrelation functions . </S>",
    "<S> recent results of linear response theory succeeded to relate in a unique way properties of statics and dynamics , relying on the recently introduced hypothesis of stochastic stability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this property states the continuity of the average correlation functions under weak random perturbation of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the property in three and four dimensional spin glasses has been numerically verified in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable consequence of stochastic stability is that dynamical ultrametricity implies the static one  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the possibility for dynamical um in the three dimensional edwards - anderson ( ea ) model . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we also perform the same test on models with domain coarsening off - equilibrium dynamics , where um should not be expected .    </S>",
    "<S> the high evidence we can achieve is based on a new dynamical method where we evolve in parallel two identical systems ( replicas for short ) with fixed value of the mutual overlap . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to a conserved - order - parameter dynamics in a ferromagnetic system and it is similar to the one already used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to study the equilibrium behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> the ea model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where the spins are ising variables , the sum spans the nearest neighbors pairs on a cubic lattice , and the couplings @xmath2 are normally distributed quenched independent random variables . </S>",
    "<S> we define the overlap among two spin configurations @xmath3 and @xmath4 as @xmath5 , which is directly related to the hamming distance @xmath6 through @xmath7 .    the mean field equilibrium solution of this model has the ultrametric property at low temperature ; for each three configuration @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 chosen with boltzmann probability , the following inequalities hold : @xmath10 which are much stronger than the usual triangular one @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been shown that , if some kind of ultrametricity holds in the low - temperature phase of the ea model , it must be of the same kind of that present in the mean - field solution .    in the off - equilibrium dynamical solution a relation analogous to eq.([sum ] ) holds for the two - time auto - correlation functions : @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> taken three large times @xmath13 , one finds that @xmath14 the precise statement is that the relation among the correlations _ should tend _ to the one of eq.([dum ] ) in the infinite time limit  @xcite . in the simulations </S>",
    "<S> the relation among the three correlations is plagued by strong finite time effect , so that a direct verification would be difficult with the present computer resources . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore decided to probe a relation which for long times is consequence of , and equivalent to , eq.([dum ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dynamics of two replicas of the system with the same disorder , @xmath3 and @xmath8 , which evolve in parallel with different thermal noises and constrained at each time to have a fixed mutual overlap @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics follows a quench at time zero and we measured the auto- and cross - correlation functions @xmath16 note that @xmath17 for ising variables , while the constraint implies @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to argue , with a hand waving argument , that the relation in eq.([dum ] ) entails the following ultrametric constraint on the cross - correlation function if the value of @xmath15 is between @xmath19 and the value of the edwards - anderson parameter : @xmath20 during the relaxation the free energy of the system decreases monotonically towards its equilibrium value . </S>",
    "<S> this will be higher or equal to the one of the unconstrained system at the same temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the basic observation is that , if @xmath15 is one of the values allowed for the overlap among equilibrium states , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  @xmath21 $ ] , the equilibrium free - energy of the constrained system should coincide with the one of the unconstrained one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([dum ] ) expresses the fact that for large times , the directions in which the system can go without increasing the free - energy must be compatible with ultrametricity </S>",
    "<S> . the constrained system can lower its free - energy down to the equilibrium value only if all the possible correlations one can form ( auto and cross ) verify for long times um inequalities . as two of the 4 correlations that can be formed with the configurations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> are fixed to @xmath15 , eq.([cum ] ) should follow . a formal argument leading to the same conclusions </S>",
    "<S> can be formulated  @xcite , extending to constrained systems the correspondence among statics and dynamics mentioned above .    in order to see how restrictive relation in eq.([cum ] ) is , let us discuss what one can expect on a general ground for the relation among @xmath26 and @xmath27 in a relaxational system . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ area ] we display the set of allowed values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( shaded area ) , simply assuming the triangular relation and a monotonic decrease of both functions when the time argument s difference increases . </S>",
    "<S> the set of values allowed by the um relation is represented with the bold dashed line .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.9    in order to check whether eq.([cum ] ) holds in the 3@xmath0 ea model , we have simulated , by monte carlo method ( metropolis update ) , two coupled systems with a soft constraint @xmath30 , imposed modifying the boltzmann weight with a gaussian of width proportional to @xmath31 , such that the weight of a configuration would be @xmath32 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the @xmath33 parameter must be appropriately tuned : a too small value would not force enough the systems and their overlap will be systematically different from the one we fixed ( @xmath15 ) . on the other hand a too large value would render movements too unprobable and the dynamics would evolve very slowly . in the whole set of runs we fixed @xmath34 for the ea model and @xmath35 for the other models . </S>",
    "<S> the choice has been made with the aim of maximizing the monte carlo acceptance rate , avoiding the systematic errors just described . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked ( see fig .  [ conv ] ) that , for these values of @xmath33 , @xmath36 tends to the desired value @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> as we study the behavior of the model in the aging regime , we do not need to reach thermalization and we can simulate large sizes ( @xmath37 ) . for such volume , </S>",
    "<S> finite size effects do not affect the dynamical regime we study . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature of a single uncoupled model is @xmath38  @xcite and we simulate the system in the spin glass phase at @xmath39 . the large size , the low temperature and the starting configuration , which is randomly chosen , </S>",
    "<S> ensure that the system stays in the aging regime all along the simulation which can be as long as @xmath40 mcs . </S>",
    "<S> these high performances have been achieved using the parallel computer ape100  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all the correlation functions we measure are extensive and self - averaging quantities , so we do not need a large number of disorder realizations . </S>",
    "<S> their fluctuations are small thanks to the large volume used and we average the results on a quite small number of samples ( @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the error on the data is always calculated as the sample - to - sample fluctuation .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.9    the first quantities we have studied are the overlap of the two replicas and the internal energy as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> as announced , we see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ conv ] that the overlap converges towards the value @xmath15 we have fixed . the `` soft '' way of imposing the constraint is evident in the behavior of the overlap , which is not equal to @xmath15 during all the run , but clearly converges to it . in the forecoming analysis </S>",
    "<S> we will use only the data obtained in the time range where the overlap is statistically compatible with @xmath15 , that is @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the data in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ conv ] show the difference between the energy of the constrained system and that of a free system evolving at the same temperature after a quench at time zero . </S>",
    "<S> as we expected , the energy difference tends to zero , as it should if the value @xmath15 is allowed at equilibrium , while for @xmath43 the energy difference goes to a finite value .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sg ] we show our main result : plotting the cross - correlation as a function of the auto - correlation we obtain , for relatively long times , that the data points are quite close to the um bound . </S>",
    "<S> a perfectly ultrametric system would stay on the line @xmath44 as long as @xmath45 and then would follow the line @xmath46 ( both lines are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sg ] ) . the data for the 3@xmath0 ea model are clearly converging to the um bound : we remind the reader that the data can not leave the shaded area of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ area ] , that is they can not cross any of the boundary lines reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sg ] , and so we expect that they naturally converge to the um bound .    to understand better how probing are our data , we have also simulated two models where um is not expected to hold : the 2@xmath0 ferromagnetic ising model , and its site diluted version in 3@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the off - equilibrium dynamics of both models shows a domain coarsening regime where the correlation function depends on both times as @xmath47 , a scaling form incompatible with ultrametricity .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.9    we have simulated a 2@xmath0 pure ferromagnetic ising model of linear size @xmath48 at a temperature @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a very large size and small waiting times ( @xmath51 ) in order to avoid that the system gets out from the aging regime we are interested in . </S>",
    "<S> these times are sufficiently large to be close to the scaling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the data are averaged on @xmath52 different noise realizations .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.05    the data from the pure ferromagnetic system are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ferro_dilu]a in the usual @xmath53 versus @xmath54 plot . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the bounds of the allowed region ( the shaded region of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ area ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the data are far away from the um bound and they seem to converge to some @xmath55-independent curve .    </S>",
    "<S> maybe one can think that the comparison of a spin glass with the pure ferromagnet is not enough . </S>",
    "<S> so we have simulated also a 3@xmath0 site - diluted ferromagnetic ising model , which has a coarsening dynamics similar to that of the pure model , but much slower  @xcite and complicated by interface pinning . </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated two samples ( each one consisting of a pair of interacting systems ) of linear size @xmath56 and spin concentration @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is well deep in the frozen phase , @xmath58 , the critical temperature being @xmath59  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ferro_dilu]b we see that the behavior of the data from the diluted ferromagnetic model may resemble that of the ea model , because it seems to be somehow close to the um bound .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.95    looking carefully at the figure we note , however , that the @xmath55-dependence of the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sg ] and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ferro_dilu]b are opposite . in fact increasing the waiting time , the value of the auto - correlation function at the point where the data leave the horizontal line decreases in the spin glass case , while it increases in the diluted ferromagnetic case . to make this effect clearer we zoomed the region of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sg ] and  [ ferro_dilu]b near the horizontal line ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zoom ] ) .    summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> we have used a new numerical method to test ultrametricity in short range spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence that for long times the ultrametric equality between two time correlations become fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> as we already stressed the property of stochastic stability implies then static ultrametricity . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of spin glasses is strikingly different from the behavior of ordered and disordered models with domain coarsening , where we find incompatibility with ultrametricity . </S>"
