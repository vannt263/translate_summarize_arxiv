    "one of the most exciting recent developments in particle physics is the discovery of neutrino oscillations pointed out by the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite and confirmed by the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations provide evidence for non - vanishing neutrino masses and mixings , with the novel feature that large leptonic mixing angles are required , in contrast to what happens in the quark sector . indeed , the combined results from these experiments suggest that , in addition to the large mixing angle required by the atmospheric neutrino data , another large angle should be present in the leptonic sector .",
    "this leads to the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution of the solar neutrino problem which turns out to be presently the most favored scenario for the explanation of the solar neutrino deficit . from a theoretical point of view , understanding the large leptonic mixing is still an unresolved mystery for which a considerable number of solutions have been proposed @xcite . on the other hand , the appearance of neutrino masses much smaller than those of charged leptons",
    "is elegantly explained through the seesaw mechanism @xcite which can be implemented by extending the standard model ( sm ) particle content with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "these can be easily accommodated in grand unified theories ( gut ) where they appear on equal footing with the other sm particles .",
    "the heavy singlet neutrino states can also play an important role in cosmology , namely , in the explanation of the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry . during the last few years",
    ", the data collected from the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite has allowed to obtain a precise measurement of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) . the map experiment  @xcite and the planck satellite  @xcite planned for the near future should further improve this result . at the present time , the measurement of the baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath0 is @xmath1    leptogenesis is one of the most attractive mechanisms to generate the bau .",
    "as first suggested by fukugita and yanagida @xcite , the key ingredient in leptogenesis are the heavy majorana neutrinos which , once included in the sm , can give rise to a primordial lepton asymmetry through their out - of - equilibrium decays .",
    "this lepton asymmetry is subsequently reprocessed into a net baryon asymmetry by the anomalous sphaleron processes .    in spite of being attractive and successful",
    ", leptogenesis turns out to be extremely difficult or even impossible to test experimentally in a direct way .",
    "this difficulty is obviously related to the large masses of the heavy majorana neutrino singlets .",
    "nevertheless , the joint analysis of leptogenesis and low - energy neutrino phenomenology can be viewed as an indirect way of testing it and here the experimental results from neutrino oscillation experiments such as those related to the search of leptonic cp violation in the future long - baseline neutrino experiments are extremely valuable @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will address the question of linking the amount and sign of the bau to low - energy neutrino experiments , namely to the sign and strength of the cp asymmetries measured through neutrino oscillations .",

    "in fact , @xmath110 can be viewed as a dominance matrix @xcite since it gives the weights of each heavy majorana neutrino in the determination of the different light neutrino masses @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath117 are weights for @xmath28 is quite obvious due to the orthogonality of @xmath110 : @xmath118 on the other hand , since @xmath119 , the single contribution @xmath120 is also given by : @xmath121 therefore , once @xmath46 is fixed , each weight @xmath117 just depends on the mass @xmath122 of the j - th heavy majorana neutrino and on its couplings with the left - handed neutrinos @xmath123 .",

    "the interpretation in terms of weights is straightforward for the rotational part of @xmath110 .",

    "although this situation is more subtle , the above dominance arguments still hold .    coming back to the connection between leptogenesis and low - energy data , it is important to note that @xmath46 does not appear in the relevant combination for leptogenesis @xmath127 , in the same way as @xmath110 does not appear in @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , one has : @xmath128 from the above discussion , it follows that it is possible to write @xmath4 in the form @xmath129 in such a way that leptogenesis and the low - energy neutrino data ( contained in @xmath35 ) depend on two independent sets of cp - violating phases , respectively those in @xmath110 and those in @xmath130 .",
    "in particular , one may have viable leptogenesis even in the limit where there are no cp - violating phases ( neither dirac nor majorana ) in @xmath46 and hence , no cp violation at low energies @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general it is not possible to establish a link between low - energy cp violation and leptogenesis .",
    "this connection is model dependent : it can be drawn only by specifying a particular _ ansatz _ for the fundamental parameters of the seesaw , @xmath4 and @xmath116 , as will be done in the following sections .",

    "therefore , we will consider next a more restrictive class of matrices @xmath4 of this form and we will show that , in an appropriate limiting case , our structures for @xmath4 lead to the ones assumed by frampton , glashow and yanagida in @xcite .",
    "from the analysis carried out in the previous section , it becomes clear that the computation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry @xmath164 in leptogenesis scenarios strongly depends on the yukawa structure of the dirac neutrino mass term and on the heavy majorana neutrino mass spectrum .",

    "in fact , the values of @xmath82 , @xmath167 and @xmath76 should not be taken as independent parameters .",
    "the second approach is based upon initial assumptions on the structure of @xmath166 and @xmath3 at high energies which are fixed by recurring to theoretical arguments like for example grand unified theories or flavor symmetries .",

    "namely , we would like to answer the question of how simple can the structure of the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix be in order not only to get an acceptable value of the baryon asymmetry but also to accommodate the neutrino data provided by the atmospheric , solar and reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "in particular , we require the non - vanishing of the cp asymmetry generated in the decays of the lightest heavy majorana neutrino , since the final value of the baryon asymmetry crucially depends on this quantity . throughout our analysis",

    "this is mainly due to the fact that at least one of these quantities depends on both phases appearing in the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix for textures i and ii .",
    "therefore , in order to establish a direct connection between the sign of the cp asymmetries @xmath168 and the low - energy cp invariant @xmath104 further assumptions are required .",

    "the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath246 completely decouples , rendering this situation phenomenologically equivalent to the two heavy neutrino case considered in @xcite .",
    "namely , it can be easily seen that for @xmath245 the phase @xmath247 can be rephased away and consequently the cp asymmetries @xmath180 and the low - energy cp invariant @xmath104 will only depend on the phases @xmath248 and @xmath249 for textures i and ii , respectively .",
    "this means that the examples considered in @xcite are special cases of our framework which is motivated by the condition that @xmath4 does not contain any phase that would only contribute to low - energy cp violation .",

    "<S> the relation between leptogenesis and cp violation at low energies is analyzed in detail in the framework of the minimal seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> working , without loss of generality , in a weak basis where both the charged lepton and the right - handed majorana mass matrices are diagonal and real , we consider a convenient generic parametrization of the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix and identify the necessary condition which has to be satisfied in order to establish a direct link between leptogenesis and cp violation at low energies . in the context of the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem , we present minimal scenarios which allow for the full determination of the cosmological baryon asymmetry and the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> some specific realizations of these minimal scenarios are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the question of the relative sign between the baryon asymmetry and cp violation at low energies is also discussed . </S>"
