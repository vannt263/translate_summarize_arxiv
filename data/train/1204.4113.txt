    "theory of inflation has been successful so far in describing the origin of observed cosmic microwave background(cmb ) anisotropies . since last decade cobe and wmap",
    "has reached a certain level in measuring the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "planck experiment is aimed at increasing the accuracy of those data in recent future . as the accuracy of measurement increased some models of inflation",
    "have been ruled out , and some models became more successful .",
    "standard hybrid inflation@xcite has been ruled out just after the release of wmap first year data@xcite .",
    "but supersymmetric version of hybrid inflation @xcite survived because it gives a red spectrum as observed by wmap . at the same time this model suggests a negligible amplitude of gravity wave which is to be verified in upcoming planck experiment@xcite .",
    "preheating is a process of rapid decay of inflaton s energy to other forms just after end of inflation .",
    "there are different mechanisms of preheating .",
    "firstly there is the old and standard concept of preheating by broad parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "possibility of this mechanism to be efficient has been studied in the context of susy - hybrid model @xcite .",
    "another process of preheating is called tachyonic preheating , which became more important than this standard one in susy - hybrid models because of the negative curvature of the potential after the end of inflation .    analysis of preheating in susy hybrid model has been an important field of study since last one decade . for preheating process in hybrid inflation @xcite ,",
    "the trajectory of the fields were analyzed taking the inflaton field and the waterfall field as homogeneous .",
    "only small inhomogeneous perturbation was considered in the background of a large homogeneous component of the waterfall field .",
    "parametric resonance was analyzed , taking fully inhomogeneous waterfall field in ref.@xcite .",
    "when tachyonic preheating is analyzed , waterfall field is generally taken to be completely inhomogeneous .",
    "in ref.@xcite for susy hybrid inflation an effectively one field potential was derived by assuming a trajectory of the homogeneous fields and neglecting the oscillation of inflaton .",
    "that form of potential was used in ref.@xcite to analyze the tachyonic preheating process in susy - hybrid inflation case .",
    "important numerical simulations have been done with latticeeasy@xcite and defrost@xcite code .",
    "these codes helped greatly to study the growth of the perturbations with time . but often hard to identify the process responsible for this growth .",
    "in this work we did not assume any effective form of the susy - hybrid potential .",
    "rather we have taken the full two - field potential .",
    "inflaton is considered completely homogeneous , but waterfall field is considered fully inhomogeneous , i.e. no background homogeneous component is assumed .",
    "so we do observe an effect of oscillating potential coming from the oscillation of inflaton field .",
    "also , the negative curvature part in the potential boosts tachyonic growth of the modes of waterfall field .",
    "we will show here that in certain range of parameter space this oscillating potential will lead to efficient parametric resonance for some fourier modes of waterfall field , while others modes may experience tachyonic growth .",
    "so , tachyonic preheating and parametric resonance are not two different processes to happen at two different times ; rather at the same time different fourier modes of waterfall field may encounter different processes .",
    "but for other ranges of parameters where amplitude of inflaton s oscillation decays down very quickly , parametric resonance is not so efficient .",
    "therefore tachyonic preheating will be the main dominating process for most of the modes in that parameter range .",
    "so , firstly from the results of our analysis we can identify two different processes of preheating at the same time .",
    "secondly , we do show that preheating process in susy - hybrid inflation is a parameter dependent process , not as it was expected in ref.@xcite . depending on the values of parameter the process of preheating for different modes of the waterfall field",
    "gets changed .",
    "we will be focusing on the f - term susy - hybrid inflation in our work .",
    "inflation occurs due to the 1-loop correction in the potential along certain flat direction . in every model of inflation",
    "some amount of parameter tuning is necessary to fit the observed data .",
    "so here also certain values of the parameters are favored for latest cmb observation .",
    "can those tuned parameter say anything about the mechanism of preheating in susy - hybrid model ? in this report we will try to address this question .",
    "in first section we will first describe the susy hybrid inflation formalism and show how to calculate the observed cmb quantities out of it .",
    "after that different mechanisms of preheating will be discussed for this model .",
    "first we will describe the process of parametric resonance with fully inhomogeneous waterfall field .",
    "we will show that how different modes of the waterfall filed behave differently under parametric resonance .",
    "condition for efficient parametric resonance will also be discussed in this section .",
    "next we will briefly outline the tachyonic preheating process . it is mostly impossible to workout the fields amplitude and occupation number analytically .",
    "so the analysis will be done mostly numerically .",
    "we present here a common formalism to describe both the processes simultaneously .",
    "growth of occupation number of different modes of the waterfall field gives the hints of what process is dominating at that situation .",
    "there is a technical problem of considering hubble parameter ( @xmath0 ) in solving the equation of motion of these fields .",
    "hubble parameter depends on the spatial average of the inhomogeneous filed . in mean field approximation equation of motion also involves the spatial average of waterfall field .",
    "so to solve this exactly one need to solve infinite number of coupled equations .",
    "this technical problem forces many authors to consider both fields as homogeneous . but",
    "here to overcome this problem we assume that the spatial average of the square of the inhomogeneous waterfall field initially grows exponentially as tachyonic preheating and settles at the minima of the potential . assuming this we see the evolution of hubble parameter . and then using that we solve the different modes of the waterfall field .",
    "after that we will show how different choices of parameters of the model can affect the process of preheating .",
    "we will also show the mode by mode pattern of the growth in occupation number for different parameter choice .",
    "we find a clear distinction between the patterns of the growth of occupation number for different choice of parameters .    in the last section we will find out what values of observed cmb quantities",
    "can this model give to us .",
    "to fit with the observed values of these quantities parameters of the model will be tuned .",
    "then we show what can those required values of parameters tell us about the mechanism of preheating .",
    "choice of values of these parameters depends on the choice of 1-loop correction in the effective potential .",
    "there are lots of different models in the susy - hybrid class where different forms of one loop correction are used .",
    "some of them have observational motivation and some of them have theoretical motivation . some times extra symmetries",
    "are also imposed in the superpotential . for these different varieties of models tuned parameters will be different .",
    "so depending on that conclusion may differ from model to model . here",
    "we take the old and standard susy - hybrid 1-loop correction just as an example . although the analysis of preheating process does not depend on the 1-loop potential .",
    "it is because this effective potential is valid only in the time of inflation .",
    "after the end of inflation a soft susy breaking mass term drives inflaton to the minima , and the value of this term is very small compared to the 1-loop correction term .",
    "so our analysis of preheating process is valid for all f - term susy hybrid model . for different form of loop correction term just different values of parameters",
    "have to be chosen and from that exact preheating process can be immediately identified from our analysis .",
    "susy hybrid inflation models are of two types , f - term inflation and d - term inflation .",
    "f - term inflation attracts more interest than d - term inflation because it is tailor made to fit with higgs mechanism . in general f - term inflation assumes a superpotential of the following form .",
    "@xmath1 here @xmath2 are chiral scalar multiplets conjugate to each other .",
    "@xmath3 is a gauge singlet scalar and contains inflaton ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "corresponding f - term scalar potential is as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be any scalar multiplet conjugate to each other . in the context of applying grand unified theories(gut )",
    "@xmath6 is thought to be the higgs of the corresponding gut group .",
    "inflation occurs in @xmath8 trajectory .",
    "this is a flat direction with a constant potential of @xmath9 .",
    "one loop correction in this direction gives rise to coleman - weinberg potential@xcite of the following form@xcite : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the fermion number , @xmath12 is the mass eigen value of the component of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the renormalization scale .",
    "total effective potential by which inflation is driven , turns out to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimensionality of the representation of @xmath17 . in total",
    "the potential has two minina , one is the local minima at @xmath18 and another is the global minima at @xmath19 .",
    "inflaton @xmath4 slowly rolls down through this effective potential during the period of inflation towards the local minima .",
    "this effective potenial is valid only in the range where @xmath20 . after the end of inflation another susy - breaking term",
    "is required to drive inflaton to @xmath21 .",
    "in general an extra mass term in the potential , say @xmath22 is assumed for this purpose .",
    "but the value of @xmath23 has to be smaller than the co - efficient of @xmath24 arising from the loop - correction @xmath25 .",
    "otherwise this term will effect the values of the observed cmb quantities at the time of horizon - exit of a particular mode of inflaton .",
    "therefore , in general these types of potentials can be divided into two parts @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the constant vacuum energy density and @xmath28 is the loop correction term",
    ".    observed cmb anisotropy parameters are mainly scalar spectral index(@xmath29 ) and amplitude of density perturbation ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these quantities are related to the inflation potential through the slowroll parameters(@xmath31 ) .",
    "@xmath32 where , @xmath33 here @xmath4 in subscript means derivative with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath34 and has a value of @xmath35 gev .",
    "amplitude of tensor perturbation is related to inflation potential as @xmath36 so tensor - to - scalar ratio takes the form @xmath37 .",
    "it can be shown that the value of @xmath28 is negligible compared to @xmath27 , so @xmath38 susy hybrid model is a model with negative @xmath39 , which gives negligibly small tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "since no gravity wave signal has yet been observed in wmap , it puts an upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio ( @xmath40 ) as 0.36 @xcite . if planck is able to measure any @xmath40 with a value of @xmath41 or above this type of model will be discarded .",
    "but if it fails to detect @xmath40 , it will also give an experimental restriction on the values of the parameters @xmath42 .",
    "in standard hybrid inflation scenario @xmath4 reaches a critical value @xmath43 , after which waterfall occurs and gives rise to the end of inflation .",
    "but for this kind of 1-loop potential slowroll parameters becomes close to unity before @xmath4 reaches @xmath44 and inflation ends little earlier than the usual case .",
    "we have numerically found that a particular relation between @xmath45 and @xmath44 will allow @xmath46 to be in the range of observed values .",
    "mechanism of preheating is a momentum dependent process , i.e. for inhomogeneous field different fourier component evolves differently with time . in parametric resonance process@xcite for some values of the wavenumber resonance occurs , while for others values it may not",
    ". in tachyonic preheating @xcite different modes experience different force term in the equation of motion depending on their wavenumber . in general",
    "both of them gives solution depending on wavenumber of the fourier mode .",
    "but tachyonic preheating if encountered by a fourier mode is lot more effective than parametric one .      in our particular model inflation",
    "ends much earlier than @xmath4 reaches the critical value @xmath44 .",
    "so for certain ranges of values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 inflaton will sustain an oscillation around local minima @xmath47 .",
    "now we fourier decompose the spatial part of @xmath6 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the co - moving wavenumber . as",
    "usual inflaton @xmath4 is regarded as spatially homogeneous .",
    "we derive the equations of motion for these two fields from equation([hybridpot ] ) and taking mean - field approximation we get @xmath50 @xmath51 is the spatially averaged value of @xmath52 . by taking @xmath53 we re - write equation([eom ] ) as : @xmath54 x_k=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have neglected the pressure term since at the time of free oscillation it is vanishingly small .",
    "frequency of oscillation of the @xmath4 field , @xmath55 , can be estimated from ( [ eom2 ] ) at a particular moment as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "for some ranges of @xmath58 values of @xmath55 is real and for some ranges it will be imaginary .",
    "this means that for the real values of @xmath55 we can get a sustainable oscillation in @xmath4 field and for imaginary values the oscillation will be over - damped , i.e. @xmath4 will quickly settle at the local minima .    for oscillatory case of @xmath4 we assume for a certain period @xmath59 and change the variable @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "this way we arrive at the familiar form of mathieu equation@xcite from ( [ eom ] ) @xmath62x_k=0\\label{mathieu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 solution of mathieu equation takes the form like @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the critical exponent and function of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in an instability band of mathieu chart @xmath68 gets a real value which gives exponential growth in @xmath69 .",
    "occupation number of @xmath70 can be calculated from the solution of eqn.([mathieu ] ) or eqn.([eom ] ) . since eqn.([mathieu ] ) assumes a purely oscillatory solution of @xmath4 we will use numerical solution of eqn.([eom ] ) to get the occupation number from the well known formula @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath74 .    in an expanding universe parametric resonance",
    "is always expected to be in broad resonance regime .",
    "values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 both change with time and parametric resonance is not constrained in a single instability band of mathieu chart .",
    "so by observing the growth of @xmath73 we can find the average critical exponent . in the @xmath75 parameter space broad parametric resonance region",
    "is identified to be in the area under @xmath76@xcite .",
    "this part of the parameter space can give efficient parametric resonance .",
    "tachyonic preheating is a process in which if a field has tachyonic instability around some extrema , its amplitude can increase explosively and preheating gets complete with a single oscillation of that field or even before a single oscillation . in our particular model as the inflaton @xmath4 crosses the critical value @xmath44 , potential for @xmath6 becomes tachyonic .",
    "amplitude of @xmath70 keeps increasing as long as @xmath77 remains negative .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking gets completed after it reaches @xmath44 .",
    "occupation number of the @xmath70 can be defined as equation([number ] ) .",
    "since @xmath72 is negative for @xmath78 we use @xmath79 without any loss of generality @xcite .",
    "if initially @xmath70 and @xmath80 is small compared @xmath4 and @xmath44 , we can have @xmath81 damping term is neglected for the time being .",
    "@xmath4 decreases with time and @xmath80 increases very fast .",
    "so , within a short time growth of @xmath70 and @xmath80 gets complete . in the same way initial growth of occupation number",
    "can also be estimated to be @xmath82    so far tachyonic preheating was analyzed neglecting the oscillating @xmath4 field .",
    "here we take a different approach to analyze tachyonic preheating and parametric resonance in a single frame .",
    "we use initial form of @xmath80 as @xmath83 then after some time when @xmath80 reaches @xmath84 we assume that it settles down at that value .",
    "since hubble parameter @xmath85 is also a function of the fields and their derivatives , this assumption allows us to see the effect of expansion of the universe at the time of preheating .",
    "many authors used to assume static universe at the time of preheating to get read of this complicacy .",
    "hubble parameter acts as a damping term in the equation of motions whose effect increases as the parameter @xmath44 and @xmath45 increases in the potential .",
    "physical wavenumber changes with time as @xmath86 at the time of the start of preheating @xmath87 has been taken to be 1 .",
    "we did not assume any particular distribution of the initial amplitude of the modes .",
    "for all modes , initial amplitude is taken to be very small compared to @xmath4 and @xmath44 .",
    "our analysis can be done with any form of initial amplitude distribution .",
    "although we find that initial amplitude can not change the process of preheating ; it can only change the time taken by the particular mode to start growing .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the plot of different quantities for @xmath88 gev and @xmath89 and right panel corresponds to @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 . the first row in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows how @xmath92 and @xmath80 behave with time .",
    "next we solve the coupled equations([eom],[eom2 ] ) for fourier component @xmath70 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 using the above form of @xmath80 .",
    "we find both the modes to oscillate around @xmath95 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "this goes contrary to the standard expectation of parametric resonance that @xmath70 will oscillate around the global minima @xmath96 .",
    "the reason behind it is the oscillating part in the potential coming from the oscillation of @xmath4 .",
    "we see that among these two parameter sets for the first one damping effect is not so visible but for the second set of parameters @xmath4 decays rapidly due to the effect of high @xmath0 .    in second row of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot @xmath0 with time .",
    "this @xmath0 is used in equations([eom],[eom2 ] ) .",
    "we see due to the damping effect of the field @xmath92 effects the @xmath0 decreases with time rapidly for the second set of parameter , whereas for the first set of parameter average value of @xmath0 remains almost constant .",
