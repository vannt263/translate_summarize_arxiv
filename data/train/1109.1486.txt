    "<S> atomic force microscopy and second - harmonic generation data show that boron doping enhances the rate of oxidation of h - terminated silicon . holes cause a greater increase in the reactivity of the si - h up bonds than that of the si - si back bonds .    </S>",
    "<S> usage : :    secondary publications and information retrieval purposes . </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : :    surface chemical processes on si , particularly oxidation , are important for many technological applications . in the si - based microelectronics industry , sio@xmath0 serves as gate dielectric . therefore , the quality of the si / sio@xmath0 interface plays a significant role in the functionality of many si based applications . </S>",
    "<S> although most of the studies of the growth of sio@xmath0 on si have focused on thermal oxidation , native oxidation under ambient conditions is also important because during device production , h - passivated surfaces are often the starting point for sequences of chemical and lithographic processes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the durability of h - passivated surfaces is a critical factor in device processing . </S>",
    "<S> + in addition to the technologically important ( 001 ) surface , oxidation of ( 111 ) oriented surfaces has also been studied . </S>",
    "<S> these studies have provided a vast amount of information regarding surface chemistry of this fundamentally and technologically important chemical reaction . </S>",
    "<S> availability of data from many different techniques makes ( 111 ) si a convenient platform for studying surface chemical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for example ir absorption measures spectral changes in si - h vibrations and relates them to chemical composition of the surface bonds.@xcite ellipsometric measurements provide information about the thickness of the oxide.@xcite x - ray photoemission spectroscopy@xcite and photoelectron diffraction@xcite provide information about the suboxides at the si / sio@xmath0 interface . </S>",
    "<S> reflectance difference spectroscopy measurements allow the number of oxidized si layers to be counted during oxidation.@xcite each of these techniques is sensitive to different aspects of chemistry . + a particularly powerful technique that has been used to study </S>",
    "<S> this interface is second harmonic generation ( shg ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the dipole contribution is forbidden in centrosymmetric materials such as si and amorphous materials such as sio@xmath0 , the si / sio@xmath0 interface provides the dominant contribution to the shg signal in this system . </S>",
    "<S> previously daum et al . used spectrally resolved shg to study suboxides and their evolution during si oxidation.@xcite downer and co - workers used shg to probe excited hot carrier injection from si - based films.@xcite tolk and co - workers showed that boron - induced interface charge traps can be studied using shg.@xcite in these studies the shg response is typically obtained as the sample is rotated , or the sample is aligned so that the plane of incidence is always parallel to a certain crystal orientation . </S>",
    "<S> similar measurements performed in ambient conditions on ( 111 ) si have provided information about early oxidation kinetics and passivity of h - terminated surfaces.@xcite + we recently employed shg anisotropy ( shga ) measurements to study bond - specific oxidation of si.@xcite by analyzing these data with the bond - charge model of nonlinear optics , we retrieve chemical kinetics characteristic of the different bonds.@xcite we discovered that tensile and compressive strain speed up and slow down , respectively , the oxidation kinetics of different bond directions , allowing control of in - plane surface chemistry during oxidation.@xcite in addition , we found that the excess electrons in a heavily n - type sample change oxidation kinetics of the different surface bonds dramatically.@xcite here , we extend these studies to ( 111 ) surfaces of p - type si wafers . </S>",
    "<S> we also performed atomic force microscopy ( afm ) measurements , which provide additional information via changes in surface morphology . we find that p - type doping makes these surfaces very reactive to oxidation . </S>",
    "<S> the up - bonds are particularly affected , oxidizing very quickly and catalyzing the formation of the growing oxide layer . despite the differences in chemical kinetics </S>",
    "<S> , the oxide terminates at the same thickness seen on n - type material . </S>",
    "<S> + we investigated three ( 111 ) si surfaces on boron - doped wafers with hole concentrations of 1.3 x 10@xmath1 , 3.6 x 10@xmath2 , and 5.1 x 10@xmath3 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these values were verified by four - point - probe experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were hyrdogen - passivated by the procedure described in ref . 16 and then installed in an ambient atomic force microscope within 3 minutes of passivation and imaged in non - contact mode as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> + afm experiments indicate significant surface reactivity in air . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows selections from the time dependent sequence of afm images for lightly ( upper panels ) and heavily ( lower panels ) p - doped samples . in these sequences , </S>",
    "<S> the bright protrusions indicate the effect of surface oxidation as described previously.@xcite the effect of a high density of holes is evident by comparison . in panel a1 and b1 , </S>",
    "<S> the initial h - passivated surfaces exhibit flat terraces separated by monatomic steps . </S>",
    "<S> for the lightly doped sample , oxidation takes longer than three hours . on the other hand , the heavily doped material oxidizes relatively rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> most of the surface is covered with a structure consistent with a typical natural oxide in less than one hour . a high concentration of holes obviously impacts surface reactivity significantly . + to gain further insight , we applied shg to study the effect of p - type doping on the oxidation of the different surface bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation beam was generated by a ti - sapphire oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> it consisted of p - polarized 100 fs pulses centered at 806 nm arriving at a repetition rate of 70 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the p - polarized shg response was detected by a photomultiplier at every 1@xmath5 as the sample was rotated by 360@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> + figures 2a and 2b show shga data for samples with hole concentrations of 3.6 x 10@xmath2 and 5.1 x 10@xmath3 @xmath4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both are normalized to the level where the shga responses no longer change with time . according to the bond model@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the three major features at azimuths 120@xmath5 , 0@xmath5 , and -120@xmath5 arise when the alignment of the exciting field is roughly parallel to one of three back bonds . as reported previously@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> oxidation increases the magnitude of the shga signal at these azimuths by increasing bond asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the two figures illustrates a significant dependence on carrier concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the three features of the heavily doped sample ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) rise almost linearly to their maximum value then remain constant thereafter . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the same three features of the moderately doped sample ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) reaches a higher maximum value and then decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we also note the existence of a 20 min incubation period for oxidation of the moderately doped sample . </S>",
    "<S> + to obtain a more quantitative understanding of the reaction dynamics of oxidation , we investigated the time evolution of the hyperpolarizabilities for up and back bonds in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperpolarizabilities are determined by least - squares fitting eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 26 ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> 18 to the shga data , as described in more detail there . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 summarizes the results for all three samples , thereby highlighting the differences that occur for different carrier concentrations . with increasing concentration the curves shift to earlier times . at the highest hole concentration investigated here , both the incubation period and the peak near 2h have vanished completely </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the up bond is now oxidizing as rapidly as the back bonds . </S>",
    "<S> + we can make these observations quantitative by least - squares fitting simple exponential functions to the data . </S>",
    "<S> an expansion of the first 40 min of the data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the green curves show the exponential fits . the incubation period , </S>",
    "<S> if present , is fitted separately . </S>",
    "<S> the time constants for the incubation and rise periods are summarized in table i.    .parameters yielding the best fits of single exponential functions to the data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    this analysis shows that the initial oxidation of p - type si is dominated by the reaction dynamics of the up bonds and that holes facilitate the oxidation . for carrier concentrations of p </S>",
    "<S> = @xmath6 10@xmath1 @xmath4 as well as 10@xmath2 @xmath4 we see that the incubation periods for the back bonds are identical </S>",
    "<S> . however , the reactivity of the up bonds clearly changes , highlighting the dominant influence of holes during the first step of oxidation , where the h of the si - h up bond is replaced by -oh . here </S>",
    "<S> , the up bonds get through their incubation phase faster , the smaller negative incubation time constants of the up bonds compared to the back bonds indicate that up bonds reach saturation quicker than the back bonds . </S>",
    "<S> but their rise time constants are considerably slower than that of the back bonds once the back bonds start to oxidize as time evolves and -oh caps become available in the second step of oxidation . at this time </S>",
    "<S> the back bonds become more reactive and dominate the oxidation process with twice the rate of the up bonds . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in the rise times for these bonds . </S>",
    "<S> positive time constants refer to new processes becoming active , the smaller these numbers get the faster the process is becoming active . </S>",
    "<S> for back bonds we obtain small positive time constants showing the dominance of these bonds once they become active . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme case is the p = 5.1 x 10@xmath3 @xmath4 sample . here </S>",
    "<S> the incubation appears to be completely missing and the evolution is a simple exponential rise with a negative time constant , suggesting that the oxidation process is rising to a saturation level . </S>",
    "<S> our ellipsometric data ( not shown ) show that for both n- and p - type samples oxidation continues until the thickness reaches a certain value , that is independent of carrier type and concentration@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with corrosion studies of si and ge in aqueous solutions , where the availability of holes which weakens the surface bonds is the rate - limiting step.@xcite + in conclusion , our afm and shga data show that presence of holes in p - type material significantly increases the oxidation rates of h - terminated ( 111 ) si samples , with the up bonds oxidizing at least as fast as the back bonds , and probably faster .    _ the authors acknowledge d. e. aspnes for fruitful discussions and j. reynolds for the resistivity measurements of our samples . </S>",
