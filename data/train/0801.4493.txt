    "spectral line surveys have revealed that high - mass star - forming regions are rich reservoirs of molecules from simple diatomic species to complex and larger molecules ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there have been rarely studies undertaken to investigate the chemical evolution during massive star formation from the earliest evolutionary stages , i.e. , from high - mass starless cores ( hmscs ) and high - mass cores with embedded low- to intermediate - mass protostars destined to become massive stars , via high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) to the final stars that are able to produce ultracompact h ii regions ( uchiis , see @xcite for a recent description of the evolutionary sequence ) .",
    "the first two evolutionary stages are found within so - called infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) . while for low - mass stars the chemical evolution from early molecular freeze - out to more evolved protostellar cores is well studied ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is far from clear whether similar evolutionary patterns are present during massive star formation .    to better understand the chemical evolution of high - mass star - forming regions we initiated a program to investigate the chemical properties from irdcs to uchiis from an observational and theoretical perspective .",
    "we start with single - dish line surveys toward a large sample obtaining their basic characteristics , and then perform detailed studies of selected sources using interferometers on smaller scales .",
    "these observations are accompanied by theoretical modeling of the chemical processes .",
    "long - term goals are the chemical characterization of the evolutionary sequence in massive star formation , the development of chemical clocks , and the identification of molecules as astrophysical tools to study the physical processes during different evolutionary stages . here",
    ", we present an initial study of the reactive radical ethynyl ( c@xmath0h ) combining single - dish and interferometer observations with chemical modeling .",
    "although c@xmath0h was previously observed in low - mass cores and photon dominated regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so far it was not systematically investigated in the framework of high - mass star formation .",
    "the 21 massive star - forming regions were observed with the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) in the 875@xmath2 m window in fall 2006 .",
    "we observed 1ghz from 338 to 339ghz and 1ghz in the image sideband from 349 to 350ghz .",
    "the spectral resolution was 0.1kms@xmath3 , but we smoothed the data to @xmath10.9kms@xmath3 .",
    "the average system temperatures were around 200k , each source had on - source integration times between 5 and 16 min .",
    "the data were converted to main - beam temperatures with forward and beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath4 rms was 0.4k .",
    "the main spectral features of interest are the c@xmath0h lines around 349.4ghz with upper level excitation energies @xmath5 of 42k ( line blends of c@xmath0h@xmath6 & c@xmath0h@xmath7 at 349.338ghz , and c@xmath0h@xmath8 & c@xmath0h@xmath9 at 349.399ghz ) .",
    "the beam size was @xmath10 .    the original submillimeter array ( sma ) c@xmath0h data toward the hmpo18089 - 1732 were first presented in @xcite .",
    "there we used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good images for all spectral lines except of c@xmath0h .",
    "for this project , we re - worked on these data only using the compact configuration . because the c@xmath0h emission is distributed on larger scales ( see  [ results ] ) , we were now able to derive a c@xmath0h image .",
    "the integration range was from 32 to 35kms@xmath3 , and the achieved @xmath4 rms of the c@xmath0h image was 450mjybeam@xmath3 . for more details on these observations see @xcite .",
    "the sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from irdcs via hmpos to uchiis .",
    "we derived our target list from the samples of @xcite .",
    "table [ sample ] lists the observed sources , their coordinates , distances , luminosities and a first order classification into the evolutionary sub - groups irdcs , hmpos and uchiis based on the previously available data .",
    "although this classification is only based on a limited set of data , here we are just interested in general evolutionary trends .",
    "hence , the division into the three main classes is sufficient .",
    "figure [ spectra ] presents sample spectra toward one source of each evolutionary group .",
    "while we see several ch@xmath11oh lines as well as so@xmath0 and h@xmath0cs toward some of the hmpos and uchiis but not toward the irdcs , the surprising result of this comparison is the presence of the c@xmath0h lines around 349.4ghz toward all source types from young irdcs via the hmpos to evolved uchiis .",
    "table [ sample ] lists the peak brightness temperatures , the integrated intensities and the fwhm line - widths of the c@xmath0h line blend at 349.399ghz .",
    "the separation of the two lines of 1.375mhz already corresponds to a line - width of 1.2kms@xmath3 .",
    "we have three c@xmath0h non - detections ( 2 irdcs and 1 hmpo ) , however , with no clear trend with respect to the distances or the luminosities ( the latter comparison is only possible for the hmpos ) . while irdcs are on average colder than more evolved sources , and have lower brightness temperatures , the non - detections are more probable due to the relatively low sensitivity of the short observations (  [ obs ] ) .",
    "hence , the data indicate that the c@xmath0h lines are detected independent of the evolutionary stage of the sources in contrast to the situation with other molecules .",
    "when comparing the line - widths between the different sub - groups , one finds only a marginal difference between the irdcs and the hmpos ( the average @xmath12 of the two groups are 2.8 and 3.1kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the uchiis exhibit significantly broader line - widths with an average value of 5.5kms@xmath3 .    intrigued by this finding , we wanted to understand the c@xmath0h spatial structure during the different evolutionary stages . therefore , we went back to a dataset obtained with the submillimeter array toward the hypercompact hii region iras18089 - 1732 with a much higher spatial resolution of @xmath13 @xcite",
    ". albeit this hypercompact hii region belongs to the class of hmpos , it is already in a relatively evolved stage and has formed a hot core with a rich molecular spectrum .",
    "@xcite showed the spectral detection of the c@xmath0h lines toward this source , but they did not present any spatially resolved images . to recover large - scale structure , we restricted the data to those from the compact sma configuration (  [ obs ] ) . with this refinement , we were able to produce a spatially resolved c@xmath0h map of the line blend at 349.338ghz with an angular resolution of @xmath14 ( corresponding to an average linear resolution of 7700au at the given distance of 3.6kpc ) .",
    "figure [ 18089 ] presents the integrated c@xmath0h emission with a contour overlay of the 860@xmath2 m continuum source outlining the position of the massive protostar .",
    "in contrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the dust continuum @xcite , the c@xmath0h emission surrounds the continuum peak in a shell - like fashion .",
    "to understand the observations , we conducted a simple chemical modeling of massive star - forming regions . a 1d cloud model with a mass of 1200m@xmath15 , an outer radius of 0.36pc and a power - law density profile ( @xmath16 with @xmath17 ) is the initially assumed configuration .",
    "three cases are studied : ( 1 ) a cold isothermal cloud with @xmath18k , ( 2 ) @xmath19k , and ( 3 ) a warm model with a temperature profile @xmath20 with @xmath21 and a temperature at the outer radius of 44k .",
    "the cloud is illuminated by the interstellar uv radiation field ( irsf , @xcite ) and by cosmic ray particles ( crp ) .",
    "the isrf attenuation by single - sized @xmath22 m silicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane - parallel geometry following @xcite .",
    "the crp ionization rate is assumed to be @xmath23  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the gas - grain chemical model by @xcite with the desorption energies and surface reactions from @xcite is used .",
    "gas - phase reaction rates are taken from rate06 @xcite , initial abundances , were adopted from the `` low metal '' set of @xcite .",
    "figure [ model ] presents the c@xmath0h abundances for the three models at two different time steps : ( a ) 100yr , and ( b ) in a more evolved stage after @xmath24yr .",
    "the c@xmath0h abundance is high toward the core center right from the beginning of the evolution , similar to previous models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . during the evolution",
    ", the c@xmath0h abundance stays approximately constant at the outer core edges , whereas it decreases by more than three orders of magnitude in the center , except for the cold @xmath18  k model .",
    "the c@xmath0h abundance profiles for all three models show similar behavior .",
    "the chemical evolution of ethynyl is determined by relative removal rates of carbon and oxygen atoms or ions into molecules like co , oh , h@xmath0o .",
    "light ionized hydrocarbons ch@xmath25 ( n=2 .. 5 ) are quickly formed by radiative association of c@xmath26 with h@xmath0 and hydrogen addition reactions : c@xmath26 @xmath27 ch@xmath28 @xmath27 ch@xmath29 @xmath27 ch@xmath30 .",
    "the protonated methane reacts with electrons , co , c , oh , and more complex species at later stage and forms methane .",
    "the ch@xmath31 molecules undergo reactive collisions with c@xmath26 , producing c@xmath0h@xmath28 and c@xmath0h@xmath29 .",
    "an alternative way to produce c@xmath0h@xmath28 is the dissociative recombination of ch@xmath30 into ch@xmath11 followed by reactions with c@xmath26 .",
    "finally , c@xmath0h@xmath28 and c@xmath0h@xmath29 dissociatively recombine into ch , c@xmath0h , and c@xmath0h@xmath0 .",
    "the major removal for c@xmath0h is either the direct neutral - neutral reaction with o that forms co , or the same reaction but with heavier carbon chain ions that are formed from c@xmath0h by subsequent insertion of carbon . at later times , depletion and gas - phase reactions with more complex species",
    "may enter into this cycle . at the cloud edge the interstellar uv radiation instantaneously dissociates co despite its self - shielding , re - enriching the gas with elemental carbon .",
    "the transformation of c@xmath0h into co and other species proceeds efficiently in dense regions , in particular in the `` warm '' model where endothermic reactions result in rich molecular complexity of the gas ( see fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "in contrast , in the `` cold '' 10k model gas - grain interactions and surface reactions become important . as a result",
    ", a large fraction of oxygen is locked in water ice that is hard to desorb ( @xmath32  k ) , while half of the elemental carbon goes to volatile methane ice ( @xmath33  k ) . upon crp",
    "heating of dust grains , this leads to much higher gas - phase abundance of c@xmath0h in the cloud core for the cold model compared to the warm model .",
    "the effect is not that strong for less dense regions at larger radii from the center .    since the c@xmath0h emission is anti - correlated with the dust continuum emission in the case of iras18089 - 1732 ( fig.[18089 ] )",
    ", we do not have the h@xmath0 column densities to quantitatively compare the abundance profiles of iras18089 - 1732 with our model .",
    "however , data and model allow a qualitative comparison of the spatial structures . estimating an exact evolutionary time for iras18089 - 1732 is hardly possible , but based on the strong molecular line emission",
    ", its high central gas temperatures and the observed outflow - disk system @xcite , an approximate age of @xmath24yr appears reasonable .",
    "although dynamical and chemical times are not necessarily exactly the same , in high - mass star formation they should not differ to much : following the models by @xcite or @xcite , the luminosity rises strongly right from the onset of collapse which can be considered as a starting point for the chemical evolution . at the same time disks and outflows evolve , which should hence have similar time - scales .",
    "the diameter of the shell - like c@xmath0h structure in iras18089 - 1732 is @xmath34 ( fig.[18089 ] ) , or @xmath19000au in radius at the given distance of 3.6kpc .",
    "this value is well matched by the modeled region with decreased c@xmath0h abundance ( fig.[model ] ) .",
    "although in principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the c@xmath0h morphology , we consider this as unlikely because the other observed molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the central submm continuum emission in iras18089 - 1732 @xcite . since c@xmath0h is the only exception in that rich dataset",
    ", chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation .",
    "the fact that we see c@xmath0h at the earliest and the later evolutionary stages can be explained by the reactive nature of c@xmath0h : it is produced quickly early on and gets replenished at the core edges by the uv photodissociation of co. the inner `` chemical '' hole observed toward iras18089 - 1732 can be explained by c@xmath0h being consumed in the chemical network forming co and more complex molecules like larger carbon - hydrogen complexes and/or depletion .",
    "the data show that c@xmath0h is not suited to investigate the central gas cores in more evolved sources , however , our analysis indicates that c@xmath0h may be a suitable tracer of the earliest stages of ( massive ) star formation , like n@xmath0h@xmath26 or nh@xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while a spatial analysis of the line emission will give insights into the kinematics of the gas and also the evolutionary stage from chemical models",
    ", multiple c@xmath0h lines will even allow a temperature characterization . with its lowest @xmath35 transitions around 87ghz",
    ", c@xmath0h has easily accessible spectral lines in several bands between the 3 mm and 850@xmath2 m .",
    "furthermore , even the 349ghz lines presented here have still relatively low upper level excitation energies ( @xmath36k ) , hence allowing to study cold cores even at sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this prediction can further be proved via high spectral and spatial resolution observations of different c@xmath0h lines toward young irdcs .",
