    "in type - ii superconductors , if the external magnetic field is greater than the first critical field @xmath0 , vortices penetrate the material .",
    "these vortices move freely in ideal superconductors if an electrical current is applied , destroying superconductivity @xcite .",
    "however , in real materials , the existence of pinning centers prevent vortex motion if the current is less than a certain value , called critical current .",
    "bean in 1966 @xcite proposed that the distribution of magnetic field inside a real sample , when the external magnetic field increses over @xmath1 , can be represented by a linear profile in a @xmath2 graph , where the slope corresponds to the critical current density .    in 1989 bak et al @xcite , in an attempt to explain the behavior of many dynamical systems , developed the concept of self organized criticality ( soc ) . in their approach , after long time of avalanches evolution , those systems reach a complex state which exhibits a power law in their avalanche size distributions and in their avalanche duration distributions , and @xmath3 noise .",
    "sandpiles have become a paradigm of these sytems , and their closed similitude with the critical state of superconductors @xcite quickly called the attention of researchers in the field @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in fact ,",
    "field et al in 1996 @xcite experimentally observed soc in vortex avalanches at the inner wall of a low-@xmath4 superconducting hollow cylinder submitted to slowly ramped axial magnetic fields . in a similar experiment performed on a low @xmath4 thin film ring , nowak et",
    "al @xcite observed either potential or peaked distributions of vortex avalanche size , depending on temperature .",
    "finally , in a recent experiment , behnia et al @xcite measured the internal vortex avalanches in a low-@xmath4 film submitted to an increasing magnetic field , and found power distributions of avalanche size only for temperatures higher than @xmath5 .    on the other hand , many simulations had been performed on vortex avalanches . in 1994 , richardson et al @xcite developed a molecular dynamic model showing the discrete evolution of the magnetic profiles inside the superconductors . also using molecular dynamic techniques , olson et al @xcite tried to mimic field s experiment .",
    "they found power distributions of avalanche sizes for high densities of pinning centers .",
    "however , none of these simulations was able to correctly estimate the critical exponents involved in the soc theory for this system because of strongly finite size effects .",
    "more recently , bassler and paczuski @xcite proposed a simple cellular automata to model the dynamics of magnetic flux motion at a length scale larger than the range of vortex interaction for a system with a random distribution of pinning centers .",
    "they obtained , using finite size scaling techniques , the existence of critical exponents for a wide distribution of parameters in their simulation , and hence , of soc . in this work",
    ", we explore the robustness of this cellular automaton varying the distribution and depth of the pinning centers .    in the next section",
    "we explain bassler and paczuski s model.in section 3 we present and discuss the results obtained using two novel pinning centers configurations : periodic distributions and combined periodic plus random distributions . finally the conclusions are given .",
    "bassler and paczuski s cellular automaton@xcite is a two dimensional hexagonal lattice where each site is occupied by @xmath6 vortices .",
    "vortices in the site @xmath7 can move towards the site @xmath8 only if the force acting on them , in that direction , is greater than zero .",
    "this force is calculated using the following formula :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the other nearest neighbors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the strengths of the pininng centers at those sites . if the distributions of pinning centers is random , @xmath16 , with a probability @xmath17 , and @xmath18 with a probability @xmath19 . the parameter @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) characterizes the long distance action of the next nearest neighbours .",
    "if there is more than one unstable direction , one of them is chosen at random .",
    "all lattice site are updated in parallel , and at each site only one vortex can move on a particular update .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to the top and the bottom of the lattice .",
    "the vortices that reach the right edge of the system are removed , while they are not allowed to abandon the system through its left edge .",
    "an avalanche begins by randomly choosing a site at the left edge of the system and adding one vortex to it .",
    "it continues with the consecutive update of the lattice sites until no more unstable sites persist .",
    "once the lattice is again stable , another vortex is added .",
    "the avalanche size is defined as the number of toplings corresponding to the addition of one vortex while the avalanche duration is defined as the number of updatings necessary to complete one avalanche .    to characterize the system , in analogy with other soc models , bassler and paczuski@xcite proposed and proved the following scaling ansatz for the probability distribution of avalanches sizes  ( [ eq : dista ] ) , and avalanches durations  ( [ eq : distt ] ) :    @xmath22    @xmath23    and obtained the following set of scaling exponents for a wide range of parameters values in the model @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 which are related by the scaling relations :    @xmath28    @xmath29    in our work , to ensure the validity of our results , we also used the following scaling ansatzs @xcite for the avalanches sizes and avalanches durations , respectively :    @xmath30    @xmath31    therefore two new scaling exponents characterize our system @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "they are related to the previous ones by : @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and satisfy the following scaling relations :    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    with this notation , bassler and paczuski s results @xcite give @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "following bassler and paczuski@xcite , we first assumed a random distribution of pinning centers , with parameters @xmath42 . in figure 1",
    "appears the collapse of our results for dimensions @xmath43 using the scaling ansatz  ( [ eq : dista1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : distt1 ] ) .",
    "the critical exponents for these conditions are in good agreement with reference @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained for other parameters within the range already checked in @xcite , in all case after a @xmath44m.c.s .",
    "then , we tested the model using a combination of periodic and random pinning distributions .",
    "this kind of configuration introduces a new parameter to geometrically characterize the system i.e , the distance between the periodic pinning centers @xmath45 . in our simulations we used @xmath46 , and a constant density of random pinning centers @xmath47 . like real irradiated superconducting materials",
    ", we used different pinning strenghts @xmath48 and @xmath49 for periodic and random pinning centers , respectively .",
    "the periodic pinning centers were always chosen stronger or equal to the random ones trying to mimic irradiation effects .",
    "for the sets of parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the critical exponents conserved the previously reported values of : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath25 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for different system dimensions , indicating the robustness of the system , ( see the two data collapse presented in figure 2 ) .",
    "we also performed simulations using only a periodic pinning configuration .",
    "it was demostrated that the system also conserved the critical exponents for the sets of parameters @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 as is shown in figure 3 .",
    "however , as the data collapse in figure 4 displays , using lower values of @xmath45 and stronger pinning centers ( for example : @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) caused a decreased in the exponents @xmath66 and @xmath33 to @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in good agreement with the scaling relations  ( [ eq : sc01 ] )  ( [ eq : sc02 ] )  ( [ eq : esc1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : esc2]).this suggests the existence of a new universality class for dense and strong periodic pinning configurations .    to study the origin of this new universality class we made calculation using a superposition of random and periodic pinning configurations with equal potentials @xmath73 .",
    "the scalings results , presented in the figure 5 , show that systems with parameters @xmath74 conserved bassler and paczuskis@xcite exponents values .    these results and those obtained using only a periodic configuration with the set of parameters @xmath75 ( see figure 3 ) proved that the new universality class appears due to the joint action of the strong periodic pinning centers and the neglegible influence of the random pinning distribution .",
    "if in the system one of these conditions is absent , it will have a `` normal '' evolution .",
    "the existence of the new universality class could be explained based on the following qualitative argument .",
    "the presence of strong and correlated pinning , the neglegible influence of the random pinning and the low values of @xmath45 could produce `` magnetic traps '' @xcite were vortices oscillate between neigbour pinning centers , increasing the number of bigger avalanches , and then reducing the characteristic exponents , @xmath76 and @xmath33 .    finally an experiment is suggested to check the existence of this new universality class .",
    "it consist in performing an avalanche detection experiment similar to the one reported in reference @xcite , but before an after irradiating the sample with heavy ions in order to obtain arrays of periodic `` strong '' pinning centers as reported by harada et al @xcite .",
    "if some relevant experimental parameters such as the magnetic field sweep rate and the temperature are conveniently tuned , critical exponents close to those reported in @xcite should be achived before irradiation . after the irradiation ( under the same set of parameters ) the combination of `` weak '' random pinning plus `` strong '' periodic pinning",
    "is expected to move the critical exponents towards the values reported here .",
    "a cellular automaton model for vortex avalanches was analized in the presence of periodic - random and periodic distributions of pinning centers .",
    "the robustness of the model was proved for a wide range of parameters and the existence of a new universality class for strong and dense periodic distribution of pinning centers was shown . a qualitative argument to support the reasons for the appareance of this new universality class",
    "were given .",
