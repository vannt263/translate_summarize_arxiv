    "the first order abel nonlinear equation of the second kind has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are all some functions of @xmath5 .",
    "the case @xmath6 has been introduced more than two hundred years ago by abel @xcite .",
    "many solvable equations of this type are collected in @xcite and other ones can be found in more recent works @xcite . the transformation @xmath7 converts this equation in the form @xmath8 which is abel s equation of the first kind .",
    "we see that abel s original equation of the second kind is actually a homogeneous case of that of the first kind .",
    "one can also write in the canonical form @xmath9 where only the case @xmath10 leads to the simple identifications : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14",
    ".    the integrability features of abel s equation in the canonical form are extremely important because of its connection with nonlinear second order differential equations that phenomenologically describe a wide class of nonlinear oscillators which in this way can be treated analytically .",
    "in particular , vein @xcite introduced an abel equation with @xmath15 and rational forms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 whose solutions are expressed in terms of third order hyperbolic functions .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the paper of vein went unnoticed for many years and only recently yamaleev @xcite provided a generalization in the framework of third order multicomplex algebra .",
    "needless to say , the corresponding veins nonlinear oscillator has not been studied in the literature .",
    "this was the main motivation for writing this paper , which is organized as follows .",
    "in section [ sec1 ] , we present a lemma that encodes the connection of abel equation with nonlinear oscillator equations and some related simple results . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we reformulate several integrability results for abel s equation with the purpose to apply them to vein s abel equation , which is the subject of section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the dynamical systems analysis of vein s oscillator is developed in section [ sec4 ] , and we end up with the conclusions .",
    "the known importance of abel s equation in its canonical form stems from the fact that its integrability leads to closed form solutions to a general nonlinear ode of the form @xmath19 where the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 are some parametric solutions that depend on a generalized coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "this can be expressed by the following lemma @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * lemma 1*. solutions to a general second - order ode of type ( [ n1p ] ) may be obtained via the solutions to abel s equation ( [ n2p ] ) and vice versa using the following relationship @xmath23 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    * proof*. to show the equivalence , one just needs the chain rule @xmath24 which turns ( [ n1p ] ) into the abel equation of the second kind in canonical form @xmath25 via the inverse transformation @xmath26 of the dependent variable , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) becomes ( [ n2p ] ) . moreover , the linear term in ( [ n2p ] ) can always be eliminated via the transformation @xmath27 which gives @xmath28 where @xmath29    the case where @xmath30 is seen from ( [ d-4 ] ) to be the one actually considered by abel , for in this case the reduced abel equation @xmath31 can be always put in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are reduced functions and are given by the expressions @xmath35 using the lemma , the reduced abel equation corresponds to a linear ode without higher - order dissipative terms @xmath36    on the other hand , in the case of @xmath37 , the abel equation of the first - kind ( [ n2p ] ) becomes a riccati equation , while the second - kind homogeneous abel equation is reduced to the riccati equation @xmath38 which is equivalent to @xmath39    this corresponds to the simple fact that an inverse power of a riccati solution also satisfies a riccati equation with redistributed coefficients .",
    "now , we eliminate the linear part to obtain the reduced riccati equation @xmath40 which corresponds to a nonlinear ode with higher - order dissipative terms @xmath41 where now the coefficients are @xmath42",
    "denote the coefficients @xmath43 of ( [ n2p ] ) , where @xmath44 are constants and @xmath45 so that @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that the roots of the equation @xmath47 are themselves solutions of ( [ n2p ] ) .",
    "more generally , the general solution of ( [ n2p ] ) is obtained via factorization of the denominator in the right - hand side of @xmath48 which leads to the following cases :    * if @xmath49 , so integration of ( [ d-5a ] ) has the form + @xmath50 * if @xmath51 , then the integration of ( [ d-5a ] ) is of the form + @xmath52 * if @xmath53 , so ( [ d-5a ] ) becomes + @xmath54 * if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the integration of ( [ d-5a ] ) leads to + @xmath57      if the following transformations as given in kamke s book @xcite @xmath58 are applied to equation , then one obtains abels equation in normal form @xmath59 where the invariant @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 thus , we conclude that if @xmath62 , then is integrable since it is separable . if one chooses relations between the functions @xmath63 such that the invariant is null and letting @xmath64 , then @xmath65 is a riccati equation , which is always integrable because it is obtained from abels equation in normal form , which is integrable .",
    "thus , the solution to is @xmath66 and explicitly , the solution to with null invariant @xmath60 is @xmath67      in this subsection , we will consider the original abel equation ( [ d-4 ] ) of the first - kind @xmath68 which corresponds to ( [ n1p ] ) without the cubic nonlinearity .",
    "let us use the transformation @xmath69 which is with @xmath70 that allows us to put into a differential form @xmath71 where @xmath72 thus , the original equation is considerably reduced only by having @xmath15 .    for equation ,",
    "if there exists an integrating factor @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant , then @xmath75 is integrable , provided that @xmath76 which leads to @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the necessary condition for the integration of ( [ abel ] ) is @xmath78    using @xmath79 , we find that there exists the potential @xmath80 , which satisfies @xmath81 therefore , the solution to ( [ d-8 ] ) is @xmath82 or in terms of the integrating factor @xmath83 by substituting the condition , the invariant has the form @xmath84      according to the book of kamke @xcite , for equations of the type for which there is no condition ( [ con ] ) , one should change the variables according to @xmath85 which lead to the canonical form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the appell invariant . then",
    ", the integrating factor @xmath88 can be used to formulate the following interesting result : + * lemma 2*. any abel equation in the canonical form is integrable as long as the invariant is constant , with @xmath89 , and solution given by .    * proof*. in , let @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , which leads to    @xmath92    that is separable , with solution @xmath93 which after simplification leads back to .",
    "the following abel equation : @xmath94 where @xmath95 , is known from a paper of vein to be integrable @xcite .",
    "we first notice that if we define the following determinants , @xmath96 then they allow us to write the coefficients of vein s equation as @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . thus , can be written in the compact form @xmath100 next , using the transformation given by with the coefficients from , we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 using these expressions , the invariant @xmath60 becomes @xmath103    therefore , the normal form of abel s equation is @xmath104 using and integrating , we obtain @xmath105 but because @xmath106 , we find @xmath107 from the last two equations , one might infer that @xmath108 and consequently using would get @xmath109 unfortunately , because for , the argument of @xmath110 is satisfied , but the argument of @xmath111 is not satisfied , then we conclude that is not the solution of",
    ".    to see how the implicit solutions , can be untangled and written explicitly , we will proceed as vein did .",
    "firstly , we show that there are actually three solutions of the type , which are the solutions of ( [ abel2 ] ) and can be put in the form @xcite : @xmath112~ , \\qquad \\frac{b}{y_2}=(ax+b^2)-(bx+a^2)\\bigg[\\frac{t_1}{t_2}\\bigg]~ , \\qquad \\frac{b}{y_3}=(ax+b^2)-(bx+a^2)\\bigg[\\frac{t_2}{t_3}\\bigg]~ , \\ ] ] with the @xmath113-functions defined cyclically as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an arbitrary constant as it does not appear in the differential equation .",

    "let @xmath125 where @xmath115 is a constant .",

    "suppose @xmath4 is defined implicitly as a multi - valued function of @xmath5 as follows @xmath128 and denote the inverse relation by the explicit formula @xmath129 then @xmath130 satisfies abel s equation ( [ abel2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , from ( [ ve-9 ] ) , differentiating with respect to @xmath4 and by the usage of ( [ ve-8 ] ) , one obtains @xmath131+b\\bigg[1-\\left(\\frac{t'}{t}\\right)\\left(\\frac{t''}{t}\\right ) \\bigg]~.\\ ] ] the quotient @xmath132 can be eliminated by means of ( [ ve-9 ] ) , which leads to @xmath133 differentiating again , this time with respect to @xmath5 we have , @xmath134\\frac{ds}{dx}~.\\ ] ] eliminating the @xmath113-quotients by means of and , one can find after some reduction the following equation @xmath135 substituting @xmath136 and dividing by @xmath137 lead to abel s equation .",

    "the other two solutions can be obtained by cyclically replacing the @xmath116 s in the @xmath113 function @xmath139",
