    "direct searches for scatterings of such wimp dark matter particles off nuclei ( see e.g.  @xcite ) probe and constrain models in highly relevant regions of parameter space .",
    "limits on the cross section of the scattering process are calculated based on the exposure of the experiment as well as events that are observed in an acceptance region .",
    "the question arises how this acceptance region should be defined . here",
    ", an algorithm is presented that allows to define an optimum acceptance region such that the experiment has the best sensitivity for a given wimp signal .",
    "hence , one can expect to obtain the most stringent limit on the dark matter scattering cross section .",
    "the algorithm is illustrated using recent data from cresst - ii  @xcite , but can be employed in any experiment .",
    "it is also shown how to consistently combine data from individual detectors or experiments with differing spectral acceptance in the framework of yellin s maximum gap or optimum interval methods  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : verenarun30d ] shows data collected in the cresst - ii experiment  @xcite that will be used as an example to explain the method . for each particle interaction in the target , the experiment collects two signals : the recoil energy @xmath0 is taken from the phonon detector , and the light output @xmath1 is measured by a separate light detector in units of kev electron equivalent @xmath2 , defined such that @xmath3 gammas from a @xmath4 calibration deposit @xmath5 in the light detector  @xcite . the light yield @xmath6 is defined as the ratio of these two parameters , @xmath7 .",
    "it serves as discrimination parameter to distinguish the dominant electron recoil background in the band around @xmath8 ( figure  [ fig : verenarun30d ] ) from the nuclear recoil signal which is expected around zero light yield .",
    "other experiments have different discrimination parameters such as the charge yield @xmath9  @xcite or the ratio of delayed and prompt scintillation @xmath10  @xcite . the algorithm presented in the following is applicable irrespectively of the nature of the discrimination parameter .",
    "( detector verena after an exposure of @xmath11  @xcite ) .",
    "counts per bin are color coded according to the grey scale on the right .",
    "the band around a light yield of unity comes from the dominating electron and gamma background .",
    "the dark matter induced nuclear recoil signal is expected around zero light yield .",
    "entries with negative light yield originate in the amplitude fitting procedure that allows for negative amplitudes in order to treat noise in an unbiased way  @xcite . the hatched area ( green )",
    "is an example of the optimum acceptance region for a @xmath12 wimp , and the area at lower energies ( blue ) an example for the case of a @xmath13 wimp . ]",
    "of course any algorithm that aims to define an acceptance region needs to be blind to the particular distribution of individual events in the data . to facilitate this ,",
    "the data can be regarded as a background density @xmath14 which is calculated based on a parametrization of the data .",
    "hence , @xmath14 is a real valued function defined for the whole parameter space @xmath15 and is independent of individual signal candidate events .    in the cresst - ii example considered here",
    ", the background can be modeled as a gaussian band , prominent in figure  [ fig : verenarun30d ] .",
    "the energy dependence of the background is taken from the measured spectrum  @xcite . to find the mean @xmath16 and width @xmath17 of the background band ,",
    "the data is fitted with a gaussian function that allows for the observed scintillator non - proportionality in the mean  @xcite , and with a parametrization for the width @xmath18 as used by the collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath19 , there is an expected signal density @xmath20 that is proportional to the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section @xmath21 .",
    "this density is calculated from the position and width of the nuclear recoil band  @xcite and the expected wimp spectrum @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "only events that are found within the acceptance region are considered to calculate a limit . in the cresst - ii example",
    ", the acceptance region is parametrized by its upper boundary @xmath23 , since the negative boundary can be taken to be at @xmath24 which is equivalent to @xmath25 for all practical purposes . for a particular realization of the acceptance region @xmath26",
    ", the expectation values for the observed number of signal and background events are then simple integrals @xmath27    given the acceptance region @xmath26 , a particular experiment will observe ( after unblinding ) a certain number of accepted events @xmath28 .",
    "this number then allows to calculate some upper limit @xmath29 still compatible with the data at a stated confidence , typically @xmath30 , often using the maximum gap or optimum interval methods ( section  [ sec : combining ] ) . here",
    "it suffices to note that the limit depends on the acceptance region : @xmath31 to transfer this number into a limit @xmath32 on the cross section , equation  [ eq : ns ] is evaluated for an arbitrary @xmath33 , yielding @xmath34 , and @xmath32 can then be calculated according to @xmath35 since @xmath36 , the primed variables eventually drop out of the equation again .    the upper limit on the cross section",
    "@xmath32 will of course depend on the particular realization of the events in a given experiment , so it can not be used as the objective function .",
    "however , the expectation value @xmath37 ( the sensitivity of the experiment ) is independent of a given experimental outcome and can be used instead .",
    "its value follows from equation  [ eq : sigmaconversion ] : @xmath38    the upper limit @xmath29 depends on the number of observed events @xmath39 , which in turn depends on the number of background events @xmath40",
    ". the distribution of @xmath40 can be assumed to be poissonian with expectation value @xmath41 from equation  [ eq : nb ] . to calculate the sensitivity @xmath37",
    ", we can then simply use the definition of the expectation value : @xmath42    the sensitivity @xmath37 depends on the acceptance region @xmath26 through equations  [ eq : ns ] and  [ eq : nb ] and is the objective function of choice .",
    "an algorithm for finding the optimum acceptance region varies @xmath23 and @xmath43 until @xmath37 is minimal . to this end ,",
    "the @xmath15 plane is binned and varied on its borders : for each energy bin , the acceptance region is increased or decreased as long as it improves the sensitivity .",
    "the algorithm is iterated until the sensitivity converges .",
    "some technical remarks will help to implement the algorithm .",
    "although @xmath44 can be drawn out of the sum in equation  [ eq : s90 ] , this does not mean that @xmath45 as @xmath46 , since @xmath29 counteracts .",
    "instead , the sum is very well behaved , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : n90graphg ] , where @xmath47 is calculated using poisson statistics .",
    "had one precise knowledge of the background , @xmath29 could also be calculated e.g.  from the feldman - cousins scheme  @xcite ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : n90graphg ] ) , but this is not used here .",
    "since the sum is well behaved , it can be tabulated for integer @xmath41 and then interpolated to speed up its computation . given the simple gaussian behavior of the signal and background densities @xmath48 and @xmath19 , it is not surprising that the objective function is also well behaved , so the algorithm rapidly converges to the optimum acceptance region .",
    "eventually , this region can be decreased again by a small amount ( e.g. by @xmath49 of the accepted wimp spectrum ) to prevent numerical ambiguities from showing up at higher energies .",
    "the optimum acceptance region then naturally extends to a maximum energy above which the acceptance is zero , @xmath50 .    .",
    "the solid curve gives the employed curve based on poisson statistics as shown in equation  [ eq : s90 ] ; dashed the ( not used ) variant in which the background is taken into account using the ordering scheme of feldman and cousins . ]    since the acceptance region is calculated using the signal expectation @xmath20 , it will be different for each wimp model that is probed .",
    "in particular , a separate acceptance region is calculated for each wimp mass . for the cresst - ii example considered here",
    ", two optimum acceptance regions are shown in figure  [ fig : verenarun30d ] for generic wimps with masses of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "for the latter , the acceptance region follows the resolution of the light channel .",
    "the acceptance regions are not smoothly bounded but show small dents .",
    "this is because the background density @xmath19 needed to evaluate equation  [ eq : nb ] is calculated using the observed spectrum , smeared in @xmath6 by the resolution of the light channel .",
    "hence , the acceptance region is reduced for example around @xmath51 where a gamma line appears in the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it may be surprising to note the shape of the optimum acceptance region for low mass wimps : it is in fact beneficial to _ increase _ the acceptance toward lower recoil energies .",
    "this is due to the recoil spectrum being a sharply falling exponential , confined to the lowest energies .",
    "hence , the increasing electron / gamma background in this parameter region is being overcompensated for .",
    "the improvement brought by this algorithm can be illustrated calculating a limit based on the above data set . to this end",
    ", an analysis threshold of @xmath52 is imposed to stay well above detection threshold  @xcite , and the same wimp expectation as used by the cresst collaboration is probed  @xcite . in particular , the wimps are expected to be distributed in the milky way in an isothermal halo with a local density of  @xmath53 , through which earth moves with a velocity of  @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "recoils with high momentum transfers are suppressed by the form factor , which is taken to be the one introduced by helm  @xcite .",
    "cross sections are normalized to a single nucleon by taking the assumed spin - independent enhancement @xmath55 on the different elements of the target into account .",
    "limits on the cross section of a coherent wimp - nucleon scattering process are calculated using the optimum acceptance region derived above and yellin s optimum interval method  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : limitsverenarun30h ] compares the limit from the optimum acceptance region with the limit obtained from this dataset by the cresst collaboration .",
    "there , the acceptance is defined to contain @xmath30 of the tungsten recoils in the energy interval @xmath56{\\ , \\mathrm{kev}}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "for comparison , some limits from other experiments are also shown .",
    "tungsten recoil acceptance region in the energy interval @xmath56{\\ , \\mathrm{kev}}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "limits from some other experiments are also shown : cresst - i  @xcite , cogent  @xcite , cdms  @xcite and xenon10  @xcite . ]    at high wimp masses , the optimum acceptance region gives a limit that is about @xmath57 stronger than with the acceptance region previously used by the cresst collaboration .",
    "for low wimp masses , the optimum acceptance region results in drastically improved limits . for example , for a @xmath13 wimp",
    "the improved limit is more than five orders of magnitude stronger than the one derived from a constant acceptance , that is to say , the optimum acceptance region allows to infer information about wimps in otherwise completely inaccessible regions of parameter space .",
    "the optimum acceptance region will be distinct for each detector , given its particular background and resolution .",
    "thus , the question arises for segmented - target experiments how to combine the individual subdetectors within the maximum gap or optimum interval methods . within these methods ,",
    "the computed limit depends on integrals over the accepted signal spectrum @xmath58 of the form @xmath59 between two observed events in the acceptance region at energies @xmath60 . to facilitate the combination of different detectors ,",
    "the energy coordinate @xmath0 is transformed to a new variable @xmath61 according to the integral transform @xmath62 which is a bijective transformation that leaves the calculated limit unchanged and occurs naturally within the maximum gap or optimum interval frameworks .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath63 is chosen as the accepted - spectrum weighted exposure @xmath64 in this new energy variable @xmath61 , the accepted signal spectrum is just a constant , which can be most easily seen manipulating differentials : @xmath65    with this transformation , all possible differences of individual detectors have been mapped into the interval @xmath66 $ ] and the single number @xmath63 .",
    "events of all detectors are distributed within @xmath66 $ ] , and @xmath63 is a measure of the exposure and acceptance of each detector .",
    "therefore , for each expected wimp spectrum ( and in particular for each wimp mass ) , individual detectors can now be joined to give the combined limit : the desired maximum gap or optimum interval method is simply applied to the energy interval @xmath67 $ ] considering the observed events from all detectors .",
    "the summed exposure is obtained by adding the individual @xmath63 up .",
    "previously , direkt dark matter searches would constrain various wimp models using one common acceptance region . here",
    "it was shown that by optimizing the acceptance region for each wimp model , one can improve the sensitivity of an experiment by orders of magnitude .",
    "this has been demonstrated with recent data from cresst - ii as an example , where a drastically improved limit resulted in particular for low mass wimps . at the same time , the algorithm introduced here removes the ambiguity from defining the acceptance region in a rather ad hoc way .",
    "it was shown how to make full use of this optimization within the maximum gap or optimum interval frameworks to achieve a combined limit for individual subdetectors of a segmented - target experiment , or different experiments altogether .",
