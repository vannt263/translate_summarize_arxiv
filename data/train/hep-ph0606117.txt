    "the observed suppression of high - momentum particles in central au - au collisions is one of the most exciting discoveries made at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) to date .",
    "it has been interpreted as a large energy loss of energetic partons traveling through an almost opaque partonic medium , the `` strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma '' ( sqgp ) .",
    "the underlying microscopic mechanism has been attributed to medium - induced radiation of gluons . however , recent data at rhic , showing a strong nuclear suppression ( small @xmath4 )  @xcite and elliptic flow ( large @xmath5 )  @xcite of `` non - photonic '' single electrons ( attributed to the semileptonic decay of charm and beauty hadrons ) in semi-/central au - au , have posed challenges to the radiative energy - loss picture within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the importance of elastic interactions of heavy quarks ( hqs ) in the qgp in this context has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite . within pqcd , radiative and elastic",
    "energy - loss mechanisms turn out to be equally important in the currently accessible momentum range at rhic , and their combined effect reduces the discrepancy with the measured electron @xmath4 in central au - au ( but does not eliminate it )  @xcite . however , even when using upscaled transport coefficients within pqcd energy - loss calculations  @xcite , the maximal single - electron ( @xmath6 ) @xmath5 is limited to 2 - 3% in semicentral au - au , while the experimental values reach up to 10% around @xmath7=2  gev  @xcite .",
    "significantly larger theoretical @xmath5 values can only be obtained if the quarks interact strongly enough to become part of the collectively expanding medium , implying that not only energy - loss but also energy - gain processes ( detailed balance ) need to be accounted for .",
    "this has recently been studied employing langevin simulations of hqs in an expanding qgp based on elastic reinteractions  @xcite . since at rhic energies , secondary production of hqs",
    "is suppressed  @xcite , the latter are also valuable probes of the soft ( collective ) properties of the putative sqgp , and can provide tests of hadronization mechanisms , e.g. , quark coalescence  @xcite .",
    "hq - momentum distributions furthermore have important impact on secondary production ( regeneration ) of heavy quarkonium states  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on our studies  @xcite of hq properties in the sqgp and applications to rhic , based on non - perturbative interactions",
    ". we will address pertinent uncertainties , open problems and consequences of our findings thus far .",
    "the interpretation of semileptonic @xmath6-spectra in @xmath8-@xmath8 collisions requires a reliable estimate of baseline spectra in @xmath9-@xmath9 , in particular their decomposition into contributions of charm and bottom decays ( bottom quarks are much more inert to changes in their momentum spectra ) .",
    "current pqcd predictions expect the transition from charm to bottom at around @xmath104 - 5gev , albeit with significant uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "this rather early onset of a bottom component constitutes part of the difficulty in explaining the large suppression observed in the @xmath6-spectra in au - au collisions . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have adopted a model - independent procedure to determine @xmath6 baseline spectra , by first reproducing available data on @xmath0 and @xmath11 spectra , evaluating their contribution to the @xmath6 spectrum at low(er ) @xmath12 , and then adjusting the bottom contribution to fill the high-@xmath12 part of the spectrum , cf .",

    "pqcd these are dominated by @xmath28-channel gluon exchange ( regulated by a debye mass ) .",
    "e.g. , at a temperature @xmath29=300  mev , and for a strong coupling constant @xmath30=0.4 , the thermal relaxation time for charm is @xmath31@xmath1515  fm/@xmath13 , well above expected qgp lifetimes of @xmath32@xmath335  fm/@xmath13 at rhic . on the other hand , lattice qcd suggests that hadronic resonance ( or bound ) states in both @xmath27-@xmath34 and @xmath24-@xmath25 channels might survive up to temperatures of @xmath32@xmath2  @xcite , cf .",

    "[ sec_base ] , the diffusion and drag coefficients as evaluated in sec .  [ sec_elast ] have been implemented into a relativistic langevin simulation for an expanding qgp fireball at rhic  @xcite .",

    "[ fig_quark ] ) , while @xmath14 quarks are less affected .",
    "the leveling - off of the @xmath13-quark elliptic flow characterizes the transition from a quasi - thermal to a kinetic regime .",
    "[ fig_eq ] illustrates the sensitivity of the langevin results to the regularization procedure applied to the @xmath27-@xmath25 loops  @xcite : at quark momenta above 3  gev a renormalized interaction ( point - like vertices ) leads to somewhat stronger effects compared to finite - size vertices ( form factor with cutoff @xmath50=1  gev and identical resonance widths ) .    to compare to @xmath6 observables ,",
    "the hqs have been hadronized and decayed semileptonically  @xcite .",
    "if the hadronization is performed by using @xmath51-function fragmentation only , the resulting @xmath6 @xmath4 and @xmath5 do not describe the data very well , cf .",
    "[ fig_frag ] .",
    "the situation improves when allowing for coalescence of the hqs with light quarks  @xcite at @xmath2 which preferentially occurs at lower momenta ( the remaining hqs are again @xmath51-function fragmented ) .",
    "consequently , we find an increase in _ both _ @xmath4 and @xmath5 mostly for momenta up to @xmath12@xmath154 - 5  gev , leading to fair agreement with experiment , cf .",
    "fig.[fig_coal ] . at higher @xmath12 ,",
    "contributions from radiative energy - loss ( which have been neglected here ) are expected to become important .",
    "note that at high @xmath12 the data for @xmath4 stay small , while the @xmath5 tends to ( much ) reduced values , which is suggestive for substantial energy loss with small collectivity .",
    "such a feature is indeed consistent with perturbative energy - loss mechanisms .",
    "we also recall that the langevin results in figs .",
    "[ fig_frag ] and [ fig_coal ] presumably overestimate the suppression and @xmath5 at high @xmath12 somewhat , due to the assumptions of ( i ) point - like vertices ( cf .",
    "[ fig_eq ] ) , and ( ii ) a thermal background medium even at high @xmath12 ( while from light hadron spectra of rhic one infers that full thermalization for light partons reaches to about @xmath12@xmath151  gev ) .",
    "the small @xmath4 and the large @xmath5 in the @xmath6 data require strong interactions of heavy quarks in the qgp , ( well ) beyond radiative energy - loss .",
    "while elastic pqcd scattering reduces the discrepancy in the @xmath4 , a sufficient collectivity to explain the @xmath5 can only be obtained for ( unrealistically ! ? ) large coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "resonance scattering is a promising candidate for a microscopic explanation of the apparently large diffusion constant ( for an estimate of energy loss due to 3@xmath223 scattering , cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    an important feature that distinguishes resonance contributions from pqcd relates to the chemical composition of the qgp .",
    "while the resonances as implemented here require the presence of anti-/quarks ( here we have assumed qgp in chemical equilibrium for 2 + 1 flavors , amounting to @xmath325 anti-/quark and 16 gluon degrees of freedom ) , pqcd approaches typically assume a gluon plasma by saturating the bound on the produced entropy in central au - au at rhic with @xmath52=1000 ; this maximizes the color charge and thus the interaction strength in both radiative ( gluon emission ) and elastic ( gluon exchange ) channels .",
    "thus , if rhic indeed produces a gluon plasma , resonance scattering could be severely suppressed ( much less is known about the presence of colored composites  @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if quark - pair production occurs early in the collision resulting in an approximately chemically equilibrated qgp  @xcite , more than half of the partons are anti-/quarks and the pqcd transport coefficient is appreciably reduced , increasing the importance of non - perturbative effects .",
    "while the existence of resonances needs to be scrutinized theoretically ( e.g. , by lqcd calculations of heavy - light correlators , or effective models based on lqcd potentials  @xcite ) , one should also search for experimental means of discrimination .",
    "the relative quark content of the colliding nuclear system can be increased by lowering the center - of - mass energy , while antiquarks ( and possibly gluons ) become suppressed .",
    "thus , one would expect stronger rescattering of @xmath53 quarks compared to @xmath13 quarks , resulting in larger @xmath5 and smaller @xmath4 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 relative to @xmath56 and @xmath57-mesons .",
    "whether such an effect is detectable at lower rhic energies , or whether one has to await the ( higher luminosities at the fixed - target ) compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment at the future gsi facility , needs to be checked in quantitative studies .",
    "we also note that diquark - like @xmath13-@xmath24 interactions could diminish the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath58 mesons ( or even charm - exchange reactions in the hadronic phase  @xcite ) .    finally , it is important to keep in mind the consistency of open and hidden charm .",
    "as has been emphasized by several authors  @xcite , secondary production ( regeneration ) of charmonia is much facilitated by a softening ( thermalization ) of the @xmath13- and @xmath53-quark momentum distributions ( for bottom / onia , this interplay appears to be less pronounced , even at the lhc  @xcite ) .",
    "heavy - quark probes at rhic have posed new challenges to the theoretical understanding of parton - energy loss at high momenta and ( the approach to ) equilibration at moderate and low momenta .",
    "currently , the severeness of this problem hinges on the interpretation of ( semileptonic - decay ) electron spectra , and in particular their relative decomposition into charm- and bottom - decay contributions ( obviously , explicit @xmath0-meson measurements would remove this ambiguity ) .",
    "if their crossing in baseline @xmath9-@xmath9 spectra occurs around @xmath12@xmath155  gev , the combination of radiative and elastic pqcd interactions of heavy quarks is apparently too weak to generate a suppression and collectivity consistent with the observed spectra in semi-/central au - au collisions .",
    "we have presented a scenario based on resonance exchange to introduce nonperturbative elastic interactions of heavy quarks in the sqgp at moderate temperatures ( relevant for rhic ) . when treated within a brownian motion scheme for an expanding qgp fireball , a fair description of the single-@xmath6 spectra up to @xmath12@xmath154 - 5  gev",
    "emerges ( especially if hadronization is supplemented with heavy - light - quark coalescence ) ; at higher @xmath12 , induced gluon radiation ( not included here ) is expected to take over and become the main source of heavy - quark energy loss .",
    "a consistent implementation of the latter in the fokker - planck approach , which requires the integration of coherence effects , is not an easy task .",
    "we have also emphasized the importance of the chemical composition of the ( early ) qgp which affects the diffusion constants in the perturbative and nonperturbative sectors ( as evaluated here ) in a rather opposite way and may thus help to disentangle the two .",
    "an excitation function could provide a valuable handle to explicitly vary the quark - to - gluon ratio to further illuminate the nature of heavy - quark diffusion in the qgp .",
