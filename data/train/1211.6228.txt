    "a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) under the influence of a large perpendicular magnetic field exhibits a remarkable dissipationless state with precisely quantized hall resistance , which is the integer quantum hall effect ( qhe ) , @xcite as a consequence of the topological rigidity of the phase .",
    "@xcite the existence of the localized bulk states plays an essential role in the precise quantization of the hall resistance .",
    "@xcite they spatially separate the counterflowing channels at the sample edge to strongly suppress backscattering .",
    "@xcite more precisely , the edge channels are regarded as  incompressible strips \" owing to the electron screening .",
    "@xcite although the nature of the qhe state is successfully explained by the topological rigidity , details of the state in nonequilibrium are largely unexplored .",
    "recent experiments aimed at quantum information processing by using edge channels , involving phase reversal of electrons in electron interferometers , @xcite decoherence , @xcite energy relaxation , @xcite and dynamics of the edge magnetoplasmons in the edge channels , @xcite have clarified electron behaviors in the nonequilibrium qhe state .",
    "thus , detailing the nonequilibrium properties of the qhe states has become an important research topic in present condensed - matter physics .    the longstanding problem of the nonequilibrium qhe state called the qhe breakdown has vexed metrology researchers for about three decades .",
    "the quantized hall resistance collapses at finite source drain voltage @xmath0 and/or at a current larger than a certain value .",
    "@xcite the qhe breakdown is , in other words , a transition from a topologically protected phase to a completely different one .",
    "for this reason , the importance of the qhe breakdown has invoked renewed interest as new types of topologically protected phases , @xcite that is , topological insulators , have gathered much attention today . as the topological insulator phase is a scion of the qhe state , a detailed understanding of how the qhe state breaks down should shed new light on the robustness of the topologically protected phases .",
    "a number of mechanisms for the qhe breakdown have been proposed thus far @xcite , and results of experiments have revealed substantial properties of the breakdown , including electron overheating through the avalanche - type electron scattering , @xcite the spatial gradient of the effective electron temperature along the electron path @xcite , the typical length of the electron heating and cooling , @xcite and the time scale of the breakdown .",
    "@xcite although these experiments have uncovered important information regarding the qhe breakdown , its mechanism remains to be clarified .",
    "@xcite    noise measurement is a promising candidate that can provide highly significant information on the qhe breakdown .",
    "in fact , it has revealed various unique properties of electron transport @xcite that could not be obtained through conventional conductance and resistance measurements . in the qhe state , the excess noise",
    "is suppressed because of the absence of backscattering .",
    "@xcite hence , we expect that we can detect the qhe breakdown by investigating the mechanism through which excess noise occurs .",
    "the excess noise may provide us with direct information on the effective electron temperature , which can be compared to the values calculated from the longitudinal resistance . @xcite to the best of our knowledge , there has been no experimental work that has studied these aspects .    in this work , we present the experimental results of the noise measurement to clarify the qhe breakdown mechanism .",
    "two distinct observations are made .",
    "the first one is that the electron heating accompanied by the breakdown is of the order of the energy gap between the highest occupied landau level and the lowest unoccupied one .",
    "second , unexpectedly , we observed finite excess noise prior to the qhe breakdown at a finite @xmath0 that is smaller than the onset voltage of the qhe breakdown ( a @xmath0 region that we define as a precursor regime ) , indicating the presence of finite dissipation in the nonequilibrium qhe states .",
    "the excess noise behaves in a way closely related to the prebreakdown of the qhe @xcite .",
    "thus , the noise measurement may give us profound information about onset of the breakdown of the qhe .",

    "<S> we performed noise measurements in a two - dimensional electron gas to investigate the nonequilibrium quantum hall effect ( qhe ) state . while excess noise is perfectly suppressed around the zero - biased qhe state reflecting the dissipationless electron transport of the qhe state , considerable finite excess noise </S>",
    "<S> is observed in the breakdown regime of the qhe . </S>",
    "<S> the noise temperature deduced from the excess noise is found to be of the same order as the energy gap between the highest occupied landau level and the lowest empty one . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> unexpected finite excess noise is observed at a finite source - drain bias voltage smaller than the onset voltage of the qhe breakdown , which indicates finite dissipation in the qhe state and may be related to the prebreakdown of the qhe . </S>"
