    "theoretical understanding of relativistic phenomena is subdue to the solution of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) equations which , owing to their high degree of nonlinearity , can hardly be solved by analytical methods .",
    "for this reason , the modeling of such phenomena has prompted the search for efficient and accurate numerical formulations . in this respect ,",
    "godunov - type schemes @xcite have gained increasing popularity due to their ability and robustness in accurately describing sharp flow discontinuities such as shocks or tangential waves .",
    "one of the fundamental ingredient of such schemes is the exact or approximate solution to the riemann problem , i.e. , the decay between two constant states separated by a discontinuity .",
    "unfortunately the use of an exact riemann solver @xcite is prohibitive because of the huge computational cost related to the high degree of nonlinearities present in the equations . instead",

    "* ) formulations are sometime preferred due to their ease of implementation and positivity properties .",
    "implementation of such algorithms can be found in the codes described by @xcite .",
    "although simpler , the hll scheme approximates only two out of the seven waves by collapsing the full structure of the riemann fan into a single average state . these solvers , therefore , are not able to resolve intermediate waves such as alfvn , contact and slow discontinuities .",

    "* ) have been proposed by @xcite in the case of purely transversal fields and by @xcite ( mb from now on ) , @xcite in the more general case .",
    "these schemes provide a relativistic extension of the work proposed by @xcite and @xcite for the classical mhd equations .",
    "hllc solvers for the equations of mhd and rmhd , however , still do not capture slow discontinuities and alfvn waves . besides",
    ", direct application of the hllc solver of mb to genuinely 3d problems was shown to suffer from a ( potential ) pathological singularity when the component of magnetic field normal to a zone interface approaches zero .",
    "a step forward in resolving intermediate wave structures was then performed by @xcite ( mk from now on ) who , in the context of newtonian mhd , introduced a four state solver ( hlld ) restoring the rotational ( alfvn ) discontinuities . in this paper",
    "we propose a generalization of miyoshi & kusano approach to the equations of relativistic mhd .",
    "as we shall see , this task is greatly entangled by the different nature of relativistic rotational waves across which the velocity component normal to the interface is no longer constant .",
    "the proposed algorithm has been implemented in the pluto code for astrophysical fluid dynamics @xcite which embeds a computational infrastructure for the solution of different sets of equations ( e.g. , euler , mhd or relativistic mhd conservation laws ) in the finite volume formalism .",

    "applications to multi - dimensional problems have been presented as well .",
    "the selected tests disclose better resolution of small scale structures together with reduced dependency on grid resolution .",
    "we argue that three dimensional computations may actually benefit from the application of the proposed solver which , albeit more computationally intensive than hll , still allows to recover comparable accuracy and resolution with a reduced number of grid zones . indeed , since a relative change @xmath340 in the mesh spacing results in a factor @xmath341 in terms of cpu time , this may largely favour a more sophisticated solver over an approximated one .",
    "this issue , however , need to receive more attention in forthcoming studies .",

    "<S> the solution to the riemann problem is approximated by a five wave pattern , comprised of two outermost fast shocks , two rotational discontinuities and a contact surface in the middle . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme is considerably more elaborate than in the classical case since the normal velocity is no longer constant across the rotational modes . </S>",
    "<S> still , proper closure to the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions can be attained by solving a nonlinear scalar equation in the total pressure variable which , for the chosen configuration , has to be constant over the whole riemann fan . the accuracy of the new riemann solver is validated against one dimensional tests and multidimensional applications . it is shown that our new solver considerably improves over the popular hll solver or the recently proposed hllc schemes .
