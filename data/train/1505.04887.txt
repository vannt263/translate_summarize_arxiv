    "a multiple - input - multiple - output interfering broadcast channel ( mimo - ibc ) , multiple mobile stations ( mss ) , each equipped with multiple antennas , simultaneously receive multiple spatial streams from their serving multiple - antenna base station ( bs ) .",
    "the channel state information of different cells are shared among the bss to enable better interference managing strategies , which is crucial for delivering high - throughput high - reliability communications services @xcite .",
    "interference alignment ( ia ) @xcite is one of these interference managing techniques which facilitates effective interference suppression by first aligning multiple interference signals into a subspace of dimension much smaller than the number of interferers .",
    "while ia is originally proposed for the interference channel ( ic ) @xcite , it has also recently found great use for transceiver designs in mimo - ibc @xcite , and other types of mimo channels .",
    "ia transceiver design in mimo - ibc is much more challenging than that in the mimo - ic because not only the inter - cell interference ( ici ) and inter - stream interference ( isi ) but also the inter - user - interference ( iui ) have to be taken into account .",
    "some early studies of this problem have been restricted to the two - cell scenario @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a closed - form solution has been derived for a two - cell ibc in which each cell can only supports two users . the downlink interference alignment scheme @xcite features a within - a - cell feedback mechanism and allows more than two users per - cell , but",
    "still can not be applied to cases with more than two cells .",
    "recently , ia transceiver designs for the general multi - cell mimo - ibc have also been reported . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a grouping method which can extend the ia design in @xcite to the multi - cell scenario . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed two different transceiver designs ( case - i and case - ii ) for the multi - cell mimo - ibc , although the case - ii design does not necessarily converge to an ia solution @xcite .",
    "more recently , a non - iterative ia transceiver design has also been proposed for a multi - cell mimo - ibc @xcite .",
    "compared to the design in @xcite , @xcite requires a smaller number of antennas to achieve the same total degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) and hence is more advantageous from the hardware perspective .",
    "in contrast to the ia case - i design of @xcite which requires the ms having more antennas than the bs , the design in @xcite avoids this restriction and hence is more realistic in practical cellular networks .    in spite of the efficiency and practicality ,",
    "we first note that there is previously unexploited flexibility in different permutations of user ordering in the transceiver design proposed in @xcite . by choosing a good user ordering for a pre - determined ia ici allocation ,",
    "improved transceiver design can be accomplished .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that exploiting user ordering to improve the system s performance is not a new concept for mimo systems when successive interference cancellation ( sic ) detection or pre - cancellation ( precoding ) @xcite is used .",
    "however , to the best of the author s knowledge , the idea of exploiting user ordering for ia linear transceiver design in a mimo - ibc setting is completely new and has not been reported in the literature .",
    "clearly , to achieve the best performance , the optimal user ordering can be obtained by the brute - force exhaustive search which is computationally prohibitive when the search space is large .",
    "aiming at achieving a more balanced performance - complexity tradeoff , we propose a suboptimal user ordering algorithm based on the technique of alternating optimization .",
