    "the study of complex systems entered social science in order to understand how self - organization , cooperative effects and adaptation arise in social communities . in this context the use of simple automata or dynamical models often elucidates the underlying dynamics of the observed behaviour ( 1 - 13 ) .",
    "in particular some models have been proposed to describe the opinion dynamics and the final decision of a community of voters ( 3,5 - 13 ) .",
    "these models focus on the self - organization resulting from a local dynamics , which represents the mutual influence , based on two simple properties :    \\i ) individuals are more likely to interact with others who already share many of their opinions ;    \\ii ) interaction increases the number of features that individuals share .",
    "however , a deeper analysis of the process which leads to the final decision in a political vote requires an improvement of the proposed models .    this can be done in a mathematical way by considering the application of the game theory to political problems @xcite or , more simply , by introducing in the decision process other important * global * effects such as , for example , the government policy and/or the propaganda , which are usually neglected .    in this paper",
    "we propose a model toward a more realistic description of the opinion dynamics underlying the choice of the voters .",
    "the analysis is restricted to a bipolar scheme with a possible third political area , but it can be generalized to the case of many political parties .",
    "this initial simplification helps to clarify the model and , anyway , it applies to many european and non european countries .",
    "the model is based on the following points to be formalized and discussed in details later on :    \\1 ) there are initially three different groups of voters : the right coalition ( rc ) , the left coalition ( lc ) and a central group ( cg ) .",
    "the voters in the rc or lc do not change their opinion : they represent the cores of the political bipolar scheme .",
    "\\2 ) the individuals of the cg interact with each other and with the individuals of the rc and of the lc . at the end of the dynamical process",
    "there are three groups : majority , minority and the others .",
    "\\3 ) the final decision of the single cg voter is based on his / her opinions on the arguments that he / she considers more relevant .",
    "\\4 ) the mutual local influence among voters is modified by the global degree of satisfaction / dissatisfaction with respect to the government .",
    "the scheme ( 1 - 4 ) is , of course , an extremely simplified version of the real processes .",
    "for example the possibility that each voter ( lc , rc , cg ) decides not to vote ( abstentionism ) is not taken into account in the dynamics and this implies that the abstentionism is proportionally distributed among the different groups .",
    "however the model has many steps of analysis , it requires the application of general techniques of the complex systems and , as we shall see , it is able to give some interesting indications on the political dynamics",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows : the cognitive political model and the social - political interaction are described in sec . 1 ; in sec .",
    "2 we set the criterion of political decision ; in sec .",
    "3 the approximations introduced in the numerical simulations are discussed ; the phenomenological analysis of the political vote in italy and germany and the prediction for the next italian vote are carried out in sec .",
    "4 ; sec . 5 is devoted to the conclusions and outlooks .",
    "in simulating the opinion dynamics toward a final political vote one has to generalize the available models of social interaction .    in the axelrod model @xcite of the cultural evolution the interaction is limited to an imitation process in which the agents adapt cultural traits stochastically from each other with a bias toward similar agents .",
    "the interesting final result of the evolution is the diversity : there are different cultural domains .    in the bounded confidence model @xcite , more oriented to the analysis of voting patterns , each voter possesses a single real valued opinion .",
    "when two voters interact , they average their opinions only if the opinion difference is within an external pre - fixed threshold otherwise there is no interaction .",
    "also in this case , as in the previous models , the system breaks up into distinct opinion clusters .    however , in the analysis of the political opinion dynamics there is , ab initio , a community with a non - negligible heterogeneity and the selfish individual convictions play a crucial role not only in the interaction among individuals but also in the degree of influence of global effects ( governments , mass media , social shocks @xcite ) on the single voter .    in particular , in a bipolar political system ,",
    "the number of votes of the two most important ( left and right ) coalitions depends upon an almost constant core of voters , who do not change their opinion , and on the individuals with less strong political convictions ( the cg ) who decide on the basis of a personal political analysis .    more precisely , in the political decision process each individual is in front of many questions of social importance ( the contexts ) and he / she has to evaluate the possible alternative choices .",
    "this analysis , based on a personal mental representation of the validity of the different alternatives , evolves according to the interaction with the other members of the community and according to the global influence .    as a result of this process",
    ", a restricted number of more relevant concepts emerges : in the individual decision making mechanism there is a simplification with respect to the social - political complexity and a `` dimensional reduction '' to the most relevant aspects .",
    "the previous considerations can be formalized by following the interesting cognitive model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that , with some peculiar modifications ( see later ) , is a good starting point to investigate the opinion dynamics toward a realistic simulation of the final political vote .    in ref .",
    "@xcite one considers @xmath0 agents who divide the world into a number @xmath1 of _ contexts _ in which they evaluate alternative possibilities ( scenarios ) according to their personal opinions .",
    "the alternative scenarios are characterized by their objective attributes @xmath2 .",
    "a crucial assumption of the model is that the agent @xmath3 s _ theoretical payoff _ from the realization of a possible scenario @xmath4 in context @xmath5 is posited to be a linear function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the agent s _ context vector _ , reflecting actual circumstances of the context and the agent s personal opinions . for each agent",
    "there are @xmath1 context vectors each of dimension @xmath8 , which are assumed fixed in the model .",
    "an agent does not know his / her context vectors explicitly as this would require a detailed understanding of the effect of all attributes on his payoffs .",
    "however , by collecting experience on choices he / she has made previously , he / she learns to approximate the payoffs using an appropriate _ mental representation_. the mental representation is built around the world s @xmath9 `` most important degrees of freedom '' , constituting the agent s concepts . one assumes again that the _ approximate payoff _ that the agent `` computes '' directly is linear @xmath10 with @xmath11 the agent s _ approximate context vector_.    by eq.(3 ) , @xmath12 is decomposed using",
    "_ mental weights _",
    "@xmath13 in a reduced subspace of dimension @xmath9 and a number @xmath9 of concept vectors , @xmath14 , assumed normalized @xmath15 , which the agent uses to evaluate alternatives .    due to the reduction of dimensionality , @xmath16 , the approximate payoff @xmath17 deviates from the theoretical payoff @xmath18 .",
    "the agents goal is to find the best possible set of concepts and mental weights which minimizes the error of the mental representation under the constraint that only @xmath9 concepts can be used .",
    "the natural measure of agent @xmath3 s _ representation error _ is the variance@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average over alternatives in context @xmath5 , that can be written as @xmath21 where the agent s utility @xmath22 is given by    @xmath23    and @xmath24 is a positive semi - definite , @xmath25 dimensional matrix , called the _ * world matrix * _ , @xmath26 which encompasses all information about agent @xmath3 s relationship to the world .",
    "the criterion for the political decision , that will be discussed in sec .",
    "2 , is based on the minimization of @xmath27 which is equivalent to maximize @xmath22 .",
    "this is the well - known * principal component analysis * ( pca ) problem . according to this ,",
    "the optimal concept vectors are provided by the @xmath9 most significant ( largest eigenvalues ) eigenvectors of @xmath28 in the considered basis of the d dimensional space ( see below ) .",
    "thus to achieve the best possible mental representation the agent should choose his / her concept vectors according to the eigenvectors of his / her world matrix in the order of their significance .",
    "two important remarks are now in order :    \\a ) in the application of the model to the political dynamics the previous considerations apply only to the agents in the cg ( see the next subsections ) . the agents in the rc and lc",
    "are assumed to have fixed orthogonal concept vectors , called @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , with scalar products @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . these vectors form the basis of two fixed orthogonal subspaces .    the orthogonality of the subspaces associated with the lc and the rc is also an approximation because in the real dynamics the concept vectors of the lc and rc are not always completely orthogonal ( bipartisan choices ) . with this approximation",
    "one assumes that the bipartisan choices are irrelevant for the final political decision .",
    "\\b ) the identification , sorting and truncation of the degrees of freedom in the model is closely analogous to what occurs in white s density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg)@xcite ) . in the dmrg",
    "the optimally renormalized degrees of freedom turn out to be the @xmath9 most significant eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix of the quantum subsystem embedded in the environment with which it interacts .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the opinion dynamics is due to local interactions among voters and to global political effects .",
    "the local and global interactions , related with the previous cognitive model , will be now separately analyzed .",
    "the representation error is minimal if the agent learns to approximate his / her world matrix in the @xmath9 dimensional subspace spanned by the most significant eigenvectors of his / her world matrix .",
    "the final vote decision is due to the social - political network and , in our bipolar scheme , it is useful to cast context vectors into two basic categories @xcite : 1 ) context vectors which only depend on a single agent , with a world matrix @xmath34 2 ) context vectors for agent @xmath3 which depend on the interaction with at least one other agent @xmath35 . for simplicity only pair interactions will be considered and following ref .",
    "@xcite the world matrix to be used in the utility function is written as    @xmath36    where the total agents number is @xmath37 , the agent @xmath3 is in the cg ( see later ) , the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 measure the relative strength of socio - political interactions with agent @xmath35 in the different groups ( cg , lc , rc ) and @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 i.e. by @xmath41 there is in @xmath24 an overlap of the concept vectors of the agents @xmath3 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to stress that the previous interactions are among the agents @xmath3 of the cg with the other agents in the same group , in the lc and in the rc .",
    "indeed , in our scheme the agents in the lc or rc do not change their opinion and their world matrices are fixed to constant @xmath34 .",
    "moreover the world matrix of the agents in the lc is orthogonal to the world matrix for the rc agents .",
    "* b ) the global effects *    the opinion making process in a national political vote depends only partially on the local interaction and is strongly influenced by other important elements such as the decisions of the government and the mass media role . in order to include these effects in the dynamical process ,",
    "let us introduce a set of indices , @xmath43 , to describe the satisfaction of the agent @xmath3 with respect to the global political decisions .",
    "again the voters in the rc and lc do not change opinion despite their satisfaction / dissatisfaction and then the satisfaction indices , @xmath44 , related with the rating of the global events , are relevant only for the voters in the cg .",
    "in the previous subsection , the local influence has been introduced by the political interaction matrices @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in the political bipolar scheme , a simple way to include the satisfaction indices , @xmath43 , in the dynamics is to consider that a voter who has a positive perception of the government actions increases the strength of its interaction with the coalition which governs while a dissatisfied voter tends to interact more with the opposition",
    ". therefore the interaction matrices of an agent @xmath3 of the cg with the agents @xmath35 of the lc or of the rc will depend on the satisfaction index in such a way to increase the interaction with the majority and decrease the interaction with the minority or viceversa .",
    "the interaction among voters in the cg remains unchanged .    in section 3",
    "the @xmath46 , @xmath47 dependence on @xmath43 will be clarified .",
    "the most important elements which determine the agent representation of the social - political system have been specified in the previous sections .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , one can assume that the system evolves according to a `` gradient adjustment dynamics '' obtained by the time evolution of the concept vectors given by @xmath48 of course , only the cg agents have a dynamical evolution because the agents in the lc and in the rc have fixed world matrices , @xmath49 , and the corresponding concept vectors span orthogonal subspaces . for the agents in the cg",
    "it is reasonable to assume that without interaction they choose random concept subspaces , i.e. complete disorder , and this implies that their matrices @xmath50 have a wishart distribution ( see @xcite ) . after the evolution according to the best response dynamics , at the equilibrium @xcite , each agent of the cg decides his / her vote and one needs a well defined criterion to understand if his / her final `` position '' is closer to the lc or the rc or is too far from both .",
    "the most simple idea is a comparison of the final concept vectors of each agent in the cg with the concept vectors of the lc and of the rc and then to define a `` political distance '' by the scalar products of the previous concept vectors .",
    "however , as clarified in ref.@xcite , the choice of the concept vectors is not unique and only the subspace they span is relevant for the dynamical process",
    ". then the criterion has to be related with the subspace spanned by cg agent concept vectors at the equilibrium with respect to the lc subspace ( i.e. spanned by the concept vectors of the lc agent ) or to the rc subspace and it is natural to consider the `` angle '' , @xmath51 , between two subspaces as the agent - agent distance @xcite .",
    "the procedure is the following one .",
    "firstly one considers the , @xmath9 , @xmath52 concept vectors of agent @xmath3 as columns of a new matrix @xmath53 ( @xmath8 x @xmath9 dimensional matrix ) .",
    "similarly we construct the matrix @xmath54 of any agent of lc and of the rc ( fixed by definition ) . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the overlap between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the following way :    @xmath55    hence , we calculate the angle @xmath51 ( in @xmath56 $ ] ) as    @xmath57)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath58)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the biggest singular value of @xmath60 according to the singular value decomposition ( svd ) . with this definition",
    "the distance is between @xmath61 ( politically equivalent ) and @xmath62 ( politically orthogonal ) .",
    "finally the agent @xmath3 will vote for the rc or the lc , according to the fact that the smallest `` angle '' is @xmath63 or @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "however , in order to have a more realistic model of the decision process , one has to take into account another important political aspect : the bipolar systems are , indeed , not perfectly bipolar .",
    "there is a non negligible part of the individuals in the cg that at the end of the dynamical evolution is still `` too far '' from the political ideas of the l and the r coalition and decide to vote for other possible groups ( og ) .",
    "of course one can neglect this point , which , however , is a crucial ingredient of the political dynamics .",
    "our definition of `` political distance '' between two agents is related to the angle @xmath65 of the corresponding subspaces spanned by the concept vectors .",
    "when @xmath66 two subspaces are orthogonal and then an agent @xmath3 of the cg will be considered voting for the og if * both * the angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 are in the range between a fixed value @xmath67 and @xmath62 .",
    "an increase of @xmath67 decreases the number of agents in the cg who vote for the third group : @xmath67 represents the `` mobility '' of the cg toward the political coalitions .",
    "the equilibrium and dynamic properties depend on the interaction matrices @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . as a first approximation ,",
    "one considers for the * local * interaction a mean - field political network with @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that , without global effects , the final voting choice is directly correlated with the number of agents of the lc and of the rc : a larger number of agents in the lc ( rc ) will automatically determine that a larger number of cg agents will we `` closer '' to the lc ( rc ) .",
    "moreover , the global effects change the interaction strength of the agent @xmath3 in the cg with the voters of the l and r coalitions , by the satisfaction index @xmath43 ( the interaction within the cg is unmodified ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath69 is independent on the agent @xmath3 . by definition",
    ", it has opposite effect on the interactions with the lc and the rc .",
    "then the starting approximation for the world matrix @xmath24 of the agent @xmath3 in the cg , which includes the local and the global interactions , can be written as @xmath70    where @xmath71 has been conventionally assumed positive if the interaction with the lc increases .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 drives the opinion dynamics and determines the majority .",
    "a more detailed analysis of its meaning and effects is carried out in section 4 .",
    "another assumption concerns the initial core distributions of the l and the r coalitions .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to take into account a numerical difference between the core voters of the two coalitions , but this would introduce another parameter in the model and , in the present work , we are mainly interested in analyzing the global effects on the vote decision . therefore , in this first version of the model , we shall consider a symmetrical initial distribution for the core voters of the l and r coalitions .",
    "moreover , abstentionism is not of dynamical origin and then , in the numerical simulation , is proportionally divided according to the group initial distributions .",
    "the initial core voters of the l and r coalitions in our simulations are assumed equal to the @xmath72 of valid votes while the cg has only the @xmath73 .",
    "these numbers are not far from the real political situation : we verified that the lowest level for the l and r coalitions ( assumed as the cores ) in italian national votes , from 1996 to 2004 , is close to the @xmath72 of the valid votes .",
    "this implies that the winning coalition is determined by the decision of a relatively small number of individuals of the cg .",
    "before analyzing the data of the national vote in italy and in germany , let us note that in the model there are essentially two parameters , @xmath71 and @xmath67 , because , in the data fitting , a change in the parameter @xmath74 gives a rescaling of the previous ones .    for the simulations of the dynamical evolution one considers the initial configuration previously discussed , with d=10 , k=4 and 10.000 agents .",
    "the results are averaged on 200 samples .",
    "table [ tab1 ] reports the results of the italian national vote from 1994 to 2004 for the different groups , the difference ( in percent ) , @xmath75 , in the final vote between the l and r coalitions and the fitted values of @xmath71 and @xmath67 which reproduce the data ( starting with the initial configurations previously discussed ) .",
    ".[tab1]the results of the italian national vote from 1994 to 2004 for the three different groups ( rc , lc , og ) and the difference ( @xmath75 ) ( in percent ) .",
    "we also report the respective values of @xmath71 and @xmath67 which allow us to reproduce the data .",
    "the l coalition includes the following parties : democratici di sinistra , margherita , rifondazione comunista , verdi , udeur , sdi , italia dei valori , comunisti italiani .",
    "the r coalition contains forza italia , alleanza nazionale , lega nord , udc , pri .",
    "the other parties are in the third group . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can see , worsening government rating , which implies a positive @xmath76 , can cause today majority to loose the election and become minority . however , this depends on the numerical value of @xmath76 and the question arises if it is somehow related to the evolution of the opinions on the government decisions as `` detected '' , for example , by polls .",
    "the answer to this risky question requires a careful comparison with the rating of the governments obtained by polls immediately before the various elections @xcite .",
    "this point is interesting also for practical reasons ( see sec .",
    "5 ) and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is a first step towards a more realistic description of the opinion dynamics of the political vote and , indeed , it has many key elements of the decision process .",
    "however there are some approximations :        however , in the real political arena the winning coalition is determined not only by the vote decision of the agents in the cg but also by the decision not to vote of the agents in the core coalition : an agent with clear political convictions but strongly dissatisfied from his / her government does not vote for the opposite coalition but prefers the abstentionism . since the winning coalition has only a few percent of vote more than the minority , this effect can easily determine the final result .",
    "\\2 ) for the same reason , the symmetric distribution of the core of the l and r coalitions is an approximation : a small initially asymmetry of the coalitions can change the final result and/or increase the strength of the global parameter @xmath71 needed for the victory .      indeed",
    ", the opinion dynamics starts soon after a political vote and completes the evolution with the next vote choice .",
    "the agents in the cg who voted for the winning coalition are , at least immediately after the vote , predominately interested to interact with the majority . from this point of view",
    ", the symmetric local interaction means that the model applies for timeframe close to the next vote or , generally , when the agents of the cg become more independent respect to the previous majority .",
    "the points 1 - 3 require the introduction of ( at least ) other three parameters in the model .",
    "this last point is interesting because during the political polls , people are more incline to answer on more general and less direct political questions . for example , the answer is less uncertain if the question is about the coalition rather than the single political party .",
    "now , it is not difficult to think of a set of undirect questions able to determine the parameters of the model ( @xmath71 , @xmath67 plus the others needed for points 1 - 3 ) and put on a more rigorous basis the relation among polls and mathematical models .",
    "finally , the next steps include : a ) a more realistic version of the model @xcite ; b ) a combined effort with poll experts ; c ) the application of the model to different countries . indeed , the correlation , if any , between @xmath71 and @xmath67 certainly depends on the peculiar characteristics of the considered nation but it should be important to verify if there are similar political behaviors in different places .",
