    "over the years , the bruggeman self consistent effective medium approximation ( sema ) for the bulk effective electrical conductivity of a composite medium @xcite has spawned a number of extensions and generalizations .",
    "those include a sema for elastic stiffness of a composite medium , @xcite a sema for a weakly nonlinear conducting composite , @xcite and a sema for a strongly nonlinear ( power law ) conducting composite .",
    "@xcite they also include a sema for a linear conducting composite medium where the constituents are characterized by _",
    "nonscalar conductivity tensors_. @xcite such approximations are needed to study the nonscalar conductivity due to an externally applied magnetic field *",
    "b*. @xcite    in composite conductors , the microstructure can induce a dependence of the ohmic resistivity on magnetic field ( i.e. , magnetoresistance ) even when none of the constituents exhibits any such dependence by itself .",
    "this arises because the local current density @xmath1 acquires spatial fluctuations in both magnitude and direction , as a result of the heterogeneity or microstructure .",
    "those are reflected in similar fluctuations of the local hall ( electric ) field @xmath2 , which usually has a nonzero component along the direction of the volume averaged current density @xmath3 .",
    "the volume average of that component of @xmath4 vanishes to leading order in * b * , but in higher orders that average is usually nonzero . as a result ,",
    "the bulk effective ohmic resistivity of the composite usually depends upon * b*. the sema developed in refs .",
    "was used in numerical studies of magnetotransport in various types of composites , where this induced magnetoresistance played an important role .",
    "@xcite it was also used in an unpublished discussion of asymptotic strong field behavior of magnetoresistance in a free - electron - conductor host with open orbit inclusions .",
    "more recently , it was shown that this type of sema , when applied to composites with a _",
    "columnar microstructure _",
    ", often violates some exact relations which exist between the different components of the bulk effective resistivity tensor .",
    "a modified sema has been developed which incorporates those exact relations [ the `` columnar unambiguous self - consistent effective medium approximation ( cusema ) '' ] ; it has been used for a detailed asymptotic analysis of metal / insulator @xmath5 and metal / superconductor @xmath6 random columnar mixtures in the strong field limit .",
    "@xcite very recently , the cusema was applied to a three - constituent metal / insulator / superconductor @xmath7 random columnar composite mixture ; a line of critical points was found to appear whenever the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 constituents are present in equal amounts , i.e. , when their volume fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are equal . at this point , the asymptotic strong field behavior of the magnetoresistance switches abruptly from saturated for @xmath12 to nonsaturating @xmath13 behavior for @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite this critical point exhibits scaling behavior , along with critical exponents and scaling functions , all of which were determined , approximately , using cusema .    in this article",
    "we present a theoretical study of magnetoresistance in three - dimensional disordered composite media . some of the systems we study are isotropic , two - constituent mixtures of isotropic constituents . in this category , we consider mixtures of normal conductors @xmath15 , @xmath16 mixtures , and @xmath17 mixtures .",
    "no `` intrinsic anisotropy '' is allowed for any constituent ; thus , open orbit constituents are not considered .",
    "the normal conducting constituents can be simple free - electron conductors , in which case only the hall resistivity depends upon * b * , or they can be more complicated conductors or semiconductors where the ohmic resistivity also depends upon * b*. but the longitudinal ohmic resistivity @xmath18 ( along * b * ) and the transverse ohmic resistivity @xmath19 ( perpendicular to * b * ) , as well as the hall resistivity @xmath20 , are assumed to be _ independent of the direction _ of * b*. we also consider an @xmath21 mixture , again with isotropic constituents , an isotropic microstructure , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 of the @xmath25 constituent which are independent of the direction of * b*.    the sema equations for these composites do not admit exact closed form solutions .",
    "however , in the strong field limit , asymptotic analysis can be applied to those equations .",
    "the strong field limit means that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the hall - to - transverse - ohmic resistivity ratio in a metallic or normal conducting constituent h=|*b*| , [ h_def ] and where @xmath28 is the hall mobility ; note that @xmath28 and @xmath24 , and therefore also @xmath27 , can be either positive or negative , depending on the sign of the majority charge carriers .",
    "this asymptotic analysis often leads to results in simple closed form , or at least `` almost closed form . '' in several cases we have also solved the sema equations numerically in order to compare with the asymptotic analysis .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section [ review ]",
    "we briefly review the sema , using a formulation that reproduces the usual sema equations for non - scalar conducting constituents in terms of depolarization coefficients of the different types of inclusions . in sections [ two_constituents ] and [ mis ] asymptotic analysis",
    "is used to find almost closed form solutions to those equations for a number of special cases .",
    "those asymptotic solutions are compared , in some cases , with numerical solutions of the same equations . in section [ two_constituents ]",
    ", we treat the special case of an @xmath29 binary mixture .",
    "all concentrations are considered , starting from the limit of extreme dilution and all the way to the percolation threshold . in section [ mis ]",
    ", @xmath21 three - constituent mixtures are treated using asymptotic analysis .",
    "a line of critical points is found where the strong field response changes abruptly in the manner of a second - order - phase - transition , as the relative amounts of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are varied .",
    "critical exponents , a scaling variable , and scaling functions are found which characterize the critical behavior .",
    "we also discuss @xmath17 and @xmath16 mixtures as special cases of these three - constituent composites .",
    "a linear dependence of the magnetoresistance upon @xmath0 is found in free - electron - metal / perfect - insulator mixtures for _ all concentrations _ where the mixture conducts macroscopically .",
    "section [ summary ] provides a discussion of the results . we formulate a physical picture of the microscopic processes ( i.e. , local current flow patterns ) which lead to some of the results found in previous sections for the macroscopic response .",
    "we also discuss a possible relation between the line of critical points found in the macroscopic magnetotransport of three - constituent @xmath21 mixtures and the phenomenon of anisotropic percolation .",
    "the self consistent effective medium approximation ( sema ) for constituents with arbitrary conductivity tensors , which appear in the system as ellipsoidal grains , was developed many years ago by one of the present authors @xcite .",
    "this development followed more specialized versions , such as all scalar conductivities , @xcite and later , strong field magnetotransport @xcite and weak field hall conductivity .",
    "@xcite here we describe a slightly different formulation of the general theory of ref .  .",
    "we use this formulation to find asymptotic physical solutions of the sema equations when the magnetic field is very strong .",
    "this formulation was described in detail in ref .. a similar formulation also appeared in ref .  .",
    "in practice , the sema requires that one calculate the electric field @xmath30 induced inside a single inclusion , with conductivity tensor @xmath31 , embedded in an otherwise uniform host with conductivity tensor @xmath32 , when an external uniform electric field @xmath33 is applied at large distances . whenever the inclusion is an ellipsoid , @xmath30 is _ uniform _ , whatever the values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "obviously , @xmath30 will be a homogeneous linear function of @xmath33 , which can be written with the help of a matrix @xmath34 _ 1=_inc_0 .",
    "if the coordinate axes are taken to lie along the principal axes of the symmetric part of the tensor @xmath32 , then we can write @xmath35 the factors @xmath36 are elements of the depolarization tensor @xmath37 , _ not of the actual physical inclusion _ , but of its image after the coordinate axes have been rescaled by the following transformation x , y , z. [ axes_rescaling ] under this transformation , the ellipsoidal inclusion is usually transformed into another ellipsoidal shape , with major axes that have different lengths and different orientations compared to those of the physical inclusion .",
    "the sema is then obtained by setting @xmath38 , and demanding that the small but exactly calculable change in @xmath3 , caused by one isolated ellipsoidal inclusion , vanish when averaged over the different kinds of inclusions .",
    "this leads to the following self consistency equations for the elements of @xmath39 0=(_e-_inc ) _ inc ( _ inc,_e ) .",
    "[ naive_ema ] in general , these are nonlinear equations , in which there appear _ non - elementary transcendental functions _ of the elements of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , closed form solutions are usually out of the question .",
    "however , we will show below that asymptotic solutions , for a very strong magnetic field * b * , can sometimes be obtained in almost closed form . for smaller values of * b * , the sema equations can be solved numerically , where needed ; these solutions are discussed below .",
    "we assume the following forms for the resistivity matrices of the host and inclusion : _",
    "host=_0 (    ccc & - & 0 + & & 0 + 0 & 0 &    ) , _ inc=_1 (    ccc 1 & -h & 0 + h & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 &    ) .[rho_host_const ] these forms mean that both the host and the inclusion have isotropic electrical response , and that the only physically selected direction is that of the magnetic field * b * , which is always taken to lie along @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that the microstructure , as well as the electrical response of all the constituents , are isotropic .",
    "the @xmath41 coefficient in @xmath42 is actually redundant .",
    "we will sometimes exploit that redundancy by choosing @xmath43 of the bulk effective resistivity tensor of the composite medium to be the same as one of the constituent values of @xmath44 .",
    "the conductivity tensors @xmath32 , @xmath31 are easily found by inverting @xmath42 , @xmath45 .    because we are considering isotropic microstructures",
    ", we will assume that all the constituents appear as spherical inclusions in the fictitious uniform effective medium host .",

    "this makes the qualitative study of their physical solutions highly nontrivial .",
    "as an illustration , we now work out the effective resistivity tensor for a binary composite of two normal metals , using the sema .",

    "since we are interested in the behavior of @xmath41 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 at strong fields , we will apply asymptotic analysis for the limiting case where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are both much greater than 1 , i.e. , @xmath69 remains bounded but @xmath70 .",
    "all other physical parameters of the two constituents are also assumed to remain bounded . from eq .",
    "( [ zz_mm ] ) it follows that @xmath50 must also remain bounded .",

    "is similar to what we find here , the present discussion shows that ( a ) one does not need to have open orbits in any constituent in order to observe this kind of behavior , ( b ) the behavior we find is a straightforward consequence of sema .",
    "since sema becomes exact in the dilute limit , when either @xmath64 or @xmath86 is very small , we believe that the asymptotic result @xmath85 is exact .",
    "it appears that the only requirement for obtaining this type of asymptotic response is that the two constituents have comparable ohmic resistivities and different hall resistivities .",
    "in fact , our numerical solutions of these equations also suggest that only the difference in the hall resistivities is crucial : the @xmath87 power law is obtained even if the two constituents have _ the same ohmic resistivities_.    in order to confirm that our ansatz for the asymptotic behavior is indeed correct , we have solved the sema equations numerically for a simple example .",

    "the hall resistivity will be very small  of order @xmath133because the local hall field @xmath4 will also be of that order .",
    "the behavior of @xmath29 mixtures is more difficult to understand qualitatively .",
    "our interpretation of the ( successful ) ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ ansatz_mm ] ) is that when @xmath203 , the current distribution saturates for large values of @xmath93 .",
    "but when @xmath204 , then that distribution continues to evolve with increasing @xmath93 , with the current distortions increasing asymptotically as @xmath205 .",
    "the macroscopic response of @xmath16 mixtures is qualitatively similar to the behavior of an isolated insulating inclusion embedded in an @xmath25 host , as shown many years ago by an exact solution for such an inclusion of spherical or cylindrical shape .",
    "@xcite the fact that this kind of behavior persists down to the percolation threshold indicates that , despite the interactions between current distortions produced by different inclusions , the local current distribution never saturates as @xmath93 increases .",
    "the results we got would require that the current distortions increase as @xmath206 for large @xmath27 . however , the fact that the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath73 diverge as @xmath207 probably signals that those distortions increase even more rapidly than @xmath206 precisely at the percolation threshold .",
    "the present results can also be compared with some simulations performed previously on a discrete network model , where finite size @xmath208 samples were considered precisely at the percolation threshold . @xcite those simulations showed that",
    ", when @xmath188 is much less than a `` magnetic correlation length '' @xmath209 , the ohmic resistivities saturate at a value proportional to @xmath210 . however , in the opposite limit @xmath211 , the ohmic resistivities continue to increase as @xmath212 .",
    "this result is consistent , within the error bars , with @xmath213 , where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are the usual percolation critical exponents for scalar ohmic conductivity ( @xmath216 , @xmath217 ) and for the percolation correlation length ( @xmath218)see ref .. using finite size scaling to replace the system size @xmath188 by @xmath219 in these results , we are led to expect that , \\ {      .[simulations ]",
    "obviously , this behavior differs in a number of ways from what was found in section [ mi ] using sema .",
    "it is not surprising that the critical exponents predicted by sema are quantitatively incorrect .",
    "however , the fact that , according to the simulations , the magnetoresistivity saturates as @xmath75 , is qualitatively at odds with the predictions of sema . clearly , this qualitative discrepancy needs to be examined further .",
    "we conjecture that it has to do with the existence of three diverging lengths in this problem , namely @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath188 .",
    "the qualitative situations described above continue to be applicable also in the case of the three - constituent @xmath21 mixtures .",
    "the presence or absence of system - spanning ( i.e. , infinite ) current flow paths , which are parallel to * b * inside the @xmath25 constituent , now depends on the relative amounts of @xmath8 and @xmath9 inclusions . the critical points or transition points @xmath189 can be expected to occur when such paths first appear with increasing @xmath11 .    obviously , this transition is a kind of percolation process .",
    "in fact , we believe it is a physical realization of `` anisotropic percolation '' .",
    "this kind of percolation was first considered many years ago in the context of a two - dimensional , randomly diluted , square bond network .",
    "@xcite the geometrical properties of anisotropic percolation in hypercubic random bond networks of arbitrary dimension were also studied extensively .",
    "@xcite    as originally defined , the anisotropic percolation problem is characterized by different occupation probabilities for bonds aligned along different principal axes of the network .",
    "this situation is not easily implemented in a continuum percolating system , because that would require an anisotropic constituent where the principal conductivities have ratios that are extremely different from 1 .",
    "also , the principal axes of different grains of that constituent would have to be _ identically oriented_. while this may be difficult to achieve in conducting materials when @xmath221 , such extreme ratios and identical orientations can easily be attained , even in an isotropic conductor , just by applying a magnetic field such that @xmath70 or @xmath222 .",
    "in that case , if we identify volume fractions with the bond occupation probabilities , then we can say that , for @xmath70 or @xmath222 , the regions that are highly conducting along * b * occupy a fraction @xmath158 of the total volume .",
    "by contrast , the regions that are highly conducting perpendicular to * b * occupy the smaller volume fraction @xmath11 .",
    "our sema result , for the transition points between saturating and non - saturating regimes of magnetoresistance , can then be interpreted as follows @xmath223 where @xmath224 represents the bond occupation probability along * b * while @xmath225 represent the bond occupation probabilities in the directions perpendicular to * b*.    the identification of the critical points in the @xmath21 magnetoresistive response with an anisotropic percolation threshold needs to be verified by a more accurate treatment of the bulk effective magnetoresistance . in particular , it needs to be determined whether the ever - present hall conductivity is an irrelevant perturbation , or whether it in fact destabilizes the usual percolation fixed point , or alters the critical behavior associated with it . in any case",
    ", we expect that such a treatment will yield different values for the critical exponents and different forms for the scaling functions and scaling variable than those obtained here using sema .",
