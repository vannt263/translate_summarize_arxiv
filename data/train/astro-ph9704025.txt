    "x1608 - 52 is a soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) that exhibits large x - ray outbursts lasting tens of days on irregular timescales ( @xmath3100  d to years , lochner & roussel - dupre 1994 ) .",
    "x1608 - 52 is an unusual source since the detection of type i x - ray bursts places it into the rare group of sxt with neutron star primaries ; most sxts are black hole candidates",
    ". the only other members of this group with optical counterparts are cen  x-4 and aql  x-1 .",
    "( for a review on sxts see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is one of the few sxts with a bright quiescent x - ray flux , allowing for an in depth study of its x - ray properties in both quiescence and outburst ( fujimoto & gottwald 1989 ; mitsuda et al . 1989 ; yoshida et al .",
    "it has been classified as an atoll - source by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) and also shows some characteristics that are usually associated with black hole candidates ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "most recently , an 800  hz qpo has also been detected ( berger et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the x - ray outbursts in sxts are thought to be due to enhanced accretion caused by an instability in either the secondary star ( hameury , king , & lasota 1986 ) or the accretion disk ( lin & taam 1984 ; mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of x1608 - 52 , qx  nor , was discovered by grindlay & liller ( 1978 ) after an outburst in 1977 . during quiescence ,",
    "the counterpart fades to as yet undetected faint optical magnitudes .",
    "we present observations of qx  nor after its reappearance following the x - ray outburst detected with xte in february 1996 ( marshall et al .",
    "ccd @xmath1 and @xmath4 band photometry of qx  nor was performed with the ctio 0.9  m telescope on 1995 may 28 ut and on several occasions in 1996 may , june , and july .",
    "overscan and bias corrections were made for each ccd image with the task _ quadproc _ at ctio to deal with the 4 amplifier readout .",
    "the data were flat - fielded in the standard manner with iraf .",
    "since there is only a single previously published finding chart of qx  nor ( grindlay & liller 1978 ) , obtained with photographic plates and of modest quality , a ccd image of the field from both 1995 and 1996 is displayed in figure  [ f - fc ] .",
    "all comparison stars used in the analysis are marked .",
    "due to the crowded field , all photometry was performed by point spread function fitting with daophot  ii ( stetson 1993 ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the standard system through observations of several landolt standard star fields ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of qx  nor and several local comparison stars are listed in table  [ t1 ] . the systematic error ( from the transformation to the standard system ) in these optical magnitudes is @xmath5  mag .",
    "the intrinsic 1@xmath6 error of the relative photometry was derived from the rms scatter in the lightcurve of the comparison stars .",
    "the errors vary between @xmath7 and @xmath8  mag depending on the brightness of the stars ( see figure  [ f - lc ] ) .",
    "in addition to the optical photometry , near - infrared ( ir ) photometry of qx  nor was performed with the cerro tololo infrared imager ( cirim ) on the ctio 1.5  m telescope on 1995 june 4 ut ( @xmath2,@xmath9 ) and 1996 august 28 ut ( @xmath2,@xmath10 ) .",
    "cirim uses a 256@xmath11256 hgcdte nicmos3 array .",
    "all observations were taken in the @xmath12 mode resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath13  pix@xmath14 .",
    "four 15  s exposures were coadded to obtain one frame .",
    "each observation consisted of a mosaic of nine individual frames , with each frame shifted from the previous one by 20@xmath15 to form a 3@xmath113 grid centered on the position of qx  nor .",
    "dark frames with identical integration times and flat field frames for each filter ( derived from observations of an illuminated dome spot ) were obtained on each night .",
    "first , a mean dark frame was subtracted from all observations .",
    "next , a sky flat was constructed from a median of the scaled object frames and subtracted from each observation .",
    "finally , the data were divided by the normalized dome flat . to increase the signal - to - noise and eliminate bad pixels ,",
    "the shifted frames were aligned and combined with a bad pixel mask .",
    "a small section of the 1995 and 1996 @xmath2 frames is displayed in the bottom panel of figure  [ f - ir ] .",
    "again , photometry was performed by point spread function fitting with daophot  ii .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the cit standard system through observations of elias faint infrared standards ( elias et al .",
    "1982 ) . only @xmath9 ( a `` short '' @xmath10 band filter which reduces the sky background contributions ) but no @xmath10 observations were taken in 1995 .",
    "however , our ir observations of standard stars in 1996 show that the instrumental @xmath9 magnitudes are about 0.15 mag fainter than the @xmath10 magnitudes of the same objects , so that we can estimate the @xmath10 magnitude of qx  nor in 1995 from the @xmath9 observations .",
    "the results for qx  nor and several local comparison stars are listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the systematic errors in the ir photometry are @xmath16  mag , and the error in the relative photometry has been estimated to be between @xmath16 and @xmath17  mag , again depending on the brightness of the stars .",
    "figure  [ f - fc ] shows two 600  s @xmath1 band exposures obtained in 1995 and 1996 .",
    "both frames reach a similar limiting magnitude , @xmath18 .",
    "since qx  nor was at a mean magnitude of @xmath0 during our 1996 post - outburst observations , it has brightened by at least 1.8  mag in @xmath1 from its quiescent state in 1995 .",
    "we also obtained several @xmath4 band observations in 1996 , but have no equivalent data from 1995 for comparison .",
    "figure  [ f - lc ] shows the relative @xmath1 band lightcurve of qx  nor and two local comparison stars .",
    "both comparison lightcurves have been shifted by 1.5  mag for clarity of display .",
    "comparison  6 is of the same brightness as the mean level of qx  nor .",
    "therefore , the 1@xmath6 error bars ( 0.05  mag ) derived from the scatter in the comparison  6 lightcurve have been adopted for qx  nor .",
    "the data are insufficient to detect any periodicity , but it is obvious that the source is variable from night to night with a full amplitude of about 0.6  mag .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ f - ir ] displays a small section of the @xmath2 frames taken in 1995 and 1996 .",
    "we detect qx  nor in _ both _ quiescence and outburst .",
    "a faint source is visible in @xmath2 but not @xmath1 in may 1995 .",
    "due to its faintness ( @xmath19 ) , we took care to confirm the ir detection of qx  nor in 1995 and exclude the possibility of a detector defect .",
    "the displayed image is a combination of nine shifted frames .",
    "the faint object is seen in each one of those separate frames and similarly in each one of nine separate @xmath9 frames ( not displayed ) .",
    "the same is true for the 1996 @xmath2 and @xmath10 band data .",
    "the photometry indicates that qx  nor brightened by about 0.8  mag in @xmath2 and @xmath10 between may 1995 and august 1996 .",
    "unfortunately , the seeing conditions during the 1996 observations were significantly worse than in 1995 , which makes a direct comparison of the @xmath2 frames difficult .",
    "several type  i x - ray bursts ( as opposed to transient outbursts ) have been observed from x1608 - 52 .",
    "assuming the eddington luminosity during bursts that show photospheric radius expansion ( at least one such burst was seen by nakamura et al .",
    "1989 ) puts x1608 - 52 at a distance of 3.6  kpc .",
    "the extinction to the source can be estimated from the hydrogen column density ( @xmath20 ) derived from x - ray spectral fits .",
    "various @xmath20 values have been suggested for x1608 - 52 ( penninx et al .",
    "1989 ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1989 ; yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) ranging from @xmath21@xmath22 . utilizing the relationship between @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the column density of gorenstein ( 1975 ) leads to @xmath25 .",
    "a more recent relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath20 based on rosat data by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) results in @xmath26 .",
    "together with a relationship between extinction and wavelength ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) , and the additional constraint of the non - detection in @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) , we arrive at the quiescent magnitudes and colors for qx  nor listed in table  [ t2 ] .    for a sxt in quiescence , the main light source is most likely the secondary star .",
    "there is evidence for a disk in sxts even in quiescence , but in most cases it contributes only 10 - 30% of the light in the system in the optical regime ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 1990 ; marsh , robinson , & wood 1994 ) .",
    "additionally , all of our observations are taken in the red and ir , and may therefore minimize any contribution from a hot accretion disk . since we have no means of estimating the brightness of any accretion disk in x1608 - 52 , we will assume that all light originates from the secondary for the following discussion .",
    "with the exception of gro j0422 + 32 ( m2v , filippenko , matheson , & ho 1995 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( f5iv , bailyn et al .",
    "1995 ) , sxts have been found to have k dwarf or subgiant companions ; for example , cen  x-4 ( k5 - k7 v / iv , mcclintock & remillard 1990 ; shabaz , naylor , & charles 1993 ) , aql  x-1 ( g7 - k3 , thorstensen , charles , & bowyer 1978 ; k5v , shabaz et al .",
    "1996 ) , a0620 - 00 ( k5v , mcclintock & remillard 1986 ; k3 - k4 v , haswell et al .",
    "1993 ) , x2023 + 338 ( k0 iv , casares & charles , 1994 ) . for qx  nor",
    ", the faint magnitudes in quiescence exclude the possibility of a giant ( luminosity class iii ) companion .",
    "if the secondary is a main sequence star , a spectral type of about g0 provides a good match with our observed magnitudes and colors for x1608 - 52 at a distance of 3.6  kpc , and implies @xmath28 for this case . for higher values of @xmath23 ( @xmath29 ) , a spectral type of f0f5 is still marginally consistent with our observations . for a k0 type companion ,",
    "x1608 - 52 has to be at a distance of @xmath30  kpc , and for an m0 secondary at @xmath31  kpc . in both of these cases a low @xmath23 from the range of possible values is also required .",
    "we can compare the two outbursts of x1608 - 52 for which optical and x - ray observations are available .",
    "grindlay & liller ( 1978 ) observed qx  nor at @xmath32 about one month after the start of the 1977 outburst .",
    "our @xmath4 band photometry shows qx  nor at a mean magnitude of @xmath33 in data taken 56 months after the onset of the 1996 outburst .",
    "figure 2e ) in lochner & roussel - dupre ( 1994 ) displays an x - ray lightcurve of the 1977 outburst taken with the vela 5b satellite , which can be compared to the x - ray lightcurve of the 1996 outburst ( obtained from the quicklook results made publicly available by the asm / rxte team ) in our figure  [ f - xte ] .",
    "our optical observations were taken when the x - ray flux of x1608 - 52 had returned to an average quiescent level of @xmath34  asm  counts  s@xmath14 ( @xmath35  crab ) .",
    "the grindlay & liller ( 1978 ) observation was obtained _ during _ the outburst when the x - ray flux was still elevated . according to the x - ray lightcurve in lochner & roussel - dupre ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the corresponding x - ray flux is @xmath36  vela  counts  s@xmath14 ( @xmath37  crab ) .",
    "we observe essentially identical @xmath4 magnitudes at very different x - ray fluxes , indicating that the x - ray flux is not directly related to the optical brightness of the system .",
    "this is true for most sxts : the optical counterparts of sxts generally mimic the behavior observed in x - rays ( a steep rise in brightness followed by a gradual decline ) ; however , the optical flux falls much more slowly than the x - ray flux , so that the optical brightness is still enhanced when the x - ray flux has already returned to a quiescent level .    if we assume a gradual optical flux decay and a similar maximum optical brightness in both the 1977 and 1996 outbursts , it is surprising that qx  nor has not faded to fainter magnitudes in our 1996 observations , which were obtained much later after the onset of an outburst than those of grindlay & liller ( 1978 ) . in order to compare the strength of the two outbursts",
    ", we tried to estimate the maximum x - ray flux reached during both outbursts , which might be indicative of the maximum optical brightness .",
    "we attempted to fit the 1996 x - ray outburst with an exponential or gaussian profile analogous to the treatment in lochner & roussel - dupre ( 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no data from the asm at the time of maximum and we could not achieve a satisfactory fit .",
    "an exponential profile to the declining branch of the asm x - ray lightcurve requires unreasonably high maximum count rates .",
    "note that kaluzienski & holt ( 1977 ) report that the 1977 outburst was characterized by an initial rapid rise followed by `` a relatively stable plateau level '' that lasted for about a month and finally a decline phase .",
    "it is also evident in figure e ) in lochner & roussel - dupre ( 1994 ) that an exponential fit does not represent the data particularly well . an outburst profile with a plateau level",
    "might also provide a better fit to the 1996 outburst .",
    "since we can not compare the two x - ray outbursts , the question of the relation between the two @xmath4 magnitudes must remain unresolved .",
    "contrary to expectations , we also do not observe any declining trend in our 1996 @xmath1 band data .",
    "figure  [ f - xte ] shows our optical observations with respect to the x - ray outburst . although qx  nor displays some variability , no obvious overall fading is evident during a time span of two months . yet , we know such fading must eventually occur , as these magnitudes are still significantly brighter than quiescence .",
    "a large number of black hole sxts show secondary and tertiary maxima .",
    "one of the best examples is the lightcurve of v616  mon ( a0620 - 00 ) , which displays the secondary maximum and a plateau - like state @xmath3200  d after the outburst lasting for about 2  months , followed by a steep drop in brightness ( whelan et al .",
    "it is conceivable that our observations of qx  nor were made during such a state .",
    "if qx  nor brightens equally in every band , then our ir observations from 1996 august 28 could be an indication that the system has faded significantly , since it was only 0.8  mag brighter than in quiescence in @xmath2 ( as opposed to the earlier 1.8  mag difference in @xmath1 ) .",
    "chen , livio , & gehrels ( 1993 ) suggest a complete model for ( black hole ) sxts based on the detailed structure in the x - ray and optical decay lightcurves , which predicts a specific correlation between x - ray and optical emission",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether there are differences in the decay lightcurves and the x - ray / optical correlation of systems with neutron star versus black hole primaries .",
    "x1608 - 52 is ideally suited for simultaneous optical / ir and x - ray observations during a future outburst due to its relatively short outburst recurrence time .",
    "only two outbursts have been observed from cen  x-4 since 1969 , while the outburst behavior of aql  x-1 is peculiar .",
    "in addition , qx  nor could be monitored for optical / ir variations in order to obtain its orbital period .",
    "both cen  x-4 and aql  x-1 have relatively long orbital periods , 15.1  h and 19.0  h respectively .",
    "x1608 - 52 is classified as an atoll - source and it has been suggested that atoll - sources as a group are characterized by short periods ; all other known atoll - source periods are @xmath38  h. the determination of the orbital period of x1608 - 52 will show whether x1608 - 52 adheres to this general picture and/or whether long orbital periods are intimately related to the transient behavior in neutron star sxts .",
    "we thank joanne hughes , eric deutsch and andrew layden for obtaining some of the observations , and don hoard and bruce margon for reading a draft of this paper and providing helpful comments .",
    "this research was in part supported by nasa grant nag5 - 1630 , and has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ."
