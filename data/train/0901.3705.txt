    "recently@xcite , the conventional view of the origin of ferromagnetism in metals has been under criticism .",
    "traditional mean - field calculations favor ferromagnetism but corrections tend to reduce the range of validity of that ground state @xcite .",
    "several recent works addressed the issue of ferromagnetism in metals , going beyond the stoner model : vollhardt _ _ et al__@xcite furnish evidence of the stability of itinerant ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model(hm)at electronic densities not too close to half - filling and large enough @xmath1 .",
    "nolting and borgiel@xcite use , for the one - band hubbard model(hm ) , a spectral density approach(sda ) , a two - pole ansatz that is equivalent to the roth method@xcite , containing some free parameters to be determined by fitting some spectral moments .",
    "ferro - and antiferromagnetic  states are obtained .",
    "ferromagnetic solution occurs only if the occupation number @xmath3 exceeds a critical value and @xmath1 exceeds a minimum value .",
    "the ferromagnetic order arises due to a shift of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quasiparticle subbands .",
    "jarrel@xcite uses a self - consistent quantum monte - carlo method for the @xmath6 one - band hm but did not find a ferromagnetic state for any filling , temperature or correlation .",
    "herrmann and nolting@xcite , also in the one - band hm , use the spectral density approach ( sda ) , and a modified alloy analogy(maa ) method . in the latter ,",
    "the atomic levels of the fictitious alloy are the ones found with the  sda . in both ,",
    "a ferromagnetic state develops , although in the maa it happens in a rather restricted region of occupation @xmath3 .",
    "they point out that an imaginary part in the self - energy , present in the maa method but not in the two - pole ansatz , causes important differences in the magnetic order of the model .",
    "an improved version of the aa which incorporates the intersite magnetic correlations@xcite seems to indicate a ferromagnetic instability for large @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "schwieger and nolting @xcite consider a two - band hm , as we do , but for @xmath8 and use both the sda and the maa methods and show that interband particle fluctuations cause a spin dependent band shift and a spin dependent broadeninig of the hubbard bands .",
    "this shift stabilizes and the broadening destabilizes ferromagnetism . for @xmath9",
    "the critical temperature @xmath10 is plotted versus hybridization ; strong fluctuations between the bands tend to suppress ferromagnetic order .",
    "we use instead a single - site approximation ( ssa)@xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "only one site , the origin say , exhibits the full coulomb interaction ; the others are subject to a local field : the spin and energy dependent self - energy @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath11 is self - consistently determined by imposing the vanishing of the scattering matrix , a condition formulated in the coherent potential approximation(cpa ) for alloys and impurity problems , to restore translation invariance .",
    "we will be working at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the metal is described by two non - degenerate bands , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath13 is a hubbard - like narrow band with in - site interaction @xmath1 , hybridized(@xmath15 ) with the second one , @xmath14 , a broader uncorrelated band .",
    "the starting hamiltonian in this work is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes spin .",
    "@xmath19 is the tunneling amplitude between neighboring sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in each band and @xmath15 the hybridization . in the single - site approximation @xcite",
    "one adopts the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath22 the method then replaces a translationally invariant problem , as defined by ( [ h ] ) , by an impurity problem where only the origin incorporates the coulomb interaction , the other sites being acted by the local ( k - independent ) field @xmath23 .",
    "but the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , describes an ` impurity problem ' in presence of coulomb intra - atomic term and we have to resort to some approximation .",
    "we use the green function method @xcite ; after some algebra one obtains for the @xmath13-band green function @xmath24 in this expression @xmath25 is the recursion relation of the @xmath13 band including hybridization and @xmath26 is the respective recursion relation of the bare band . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in arbitrary energy units .",
    "all energy magnitudes are taken in units of @xmath29 , making them dimensionless .",
    "the bare @xmath13 band width is then @xmath30 . for simplicity",
    "we use @xmath31 ( homothetic bands ) , for the bare @xmath14 band .",
    "@xmath32 is the shift between the center of the bands . from now on we take @xmath33 and @xmath34constant independent of @xmath35 .",
    "the scattering @xmath36-matrix in eq.([gaa ] ) is given by    @xmath37[1+\\sigma^\\sigma(w ) f^\\sigma(w)]}}.   \\label{t}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 the self - energy @xmath23 is complex and spin dependent - thus giving a spin dependent band shift .",
    "the vanishing of the t - matrix gives a self - consistent equation for the self - energy : @xmath39 it is important to stress that eq.([elivre ] ) results from a _ configuration _ average caracteristic of a cpa approach and not from a dynamical constraint .",
    "the green function @xmath40 then becomes @xmath41 while @xmath42 is @xmath43 with @xmath44 the green function of the bare b band .",
    "the procedure presented here has some similarity to the one used in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcitein the following sense : here the original lattice model with correlation in every site is replaced by an effective one , where the correlation is present only at the origin ( the impurity ) but at the same dimension @xmath45 .",
    "in the numerical calculations one chooses the total number of electrons per site as being about @xmath46 , a little more than half - filling .",
    "we start with @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eq([elivre ] ) , searching for a ferromagnetic solution in a less than half filled a - band .",
    "the dynamics generated by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then , redistributes the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 band electrons , mixing the up and down states eventually producing a magnetization . in ref.@xcite however , the density of the correlated band , rather than @xmath3 , is kept fixed . for comparison , in figs ( [ mv1 ] ) and ( [ mv2 ] ) , we took @xmath46 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 while in fig ( [ mv3 ] ) , @xmath51 , @xmath52 e @xmath50 .",
    "we found that , for a certain range of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , a ferromagnetic state ( fs ) develops .",
    "we then investigate the effect of @xmath0 in this state , for a given @xmath1 in the weak ( @xmath53 ) , in the intermediate ( @xmath54 ) and in the strong coupling ( @xmath55 ) limits .",
    "in fig ( [ mv1 ] ) we display the magnetization @xmath56 versus @xmath0 for @xmath57 . for @xmath58",
    "the magnetization is already very small or zero . for a given u ,",
    "the effect of the hybridization is such as to reduce or suppress the magnetization .    in the intermediate limit , e.g. , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , as shown in fig([mv2 ] ) , ferromagnetism is also observed ; again increasing @xmath0 the metal tends to a non - magnetic state .    in fig([mv3 ] ) we exhibit the magnetization for a typical strong coupling situation , namely , @xmath9 . we notice that the decrease of the magnetization with @xmath0 is now slower than for smaller @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the present method is computationally feasible , producing reliable and physically sensible results compatibles with the existing literature on this important subject , opening new insights concerning the possible @xmath61 regimes .",
    "further work , for @xmath62 , and extending the model to include a two sublattice system in order to describe possible antiferromagnetic states , is in progress .",
