    "quantum systems exhibit many features that are contradictory to classical systems .",
    "the most well known are the concepts of complementarity , entanglement and nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "such nonclassical behavior enables quantum systems to outperform classical systems for a wide range of tasks in quantum information processing and communication  @xcite . in particular , in energy transport , quantum coherence enables a system to exploit the dynamics of quantum walks  @xcite , which are significantly faster than those of classical walks and diffusion .",
    "however , despite the many advantages offered by quantum systems , they are extremely challenging to isolate and invariably interact with their environment .",
    "this causes the loss of their quantum properties by decoherence , ultimately destroying any quantum advantage . in this work",
    ", we show that when quantum systems in a network are designed to interact with their environment in a shared way  @xcite , they are able to maintain their quantum coherence and even use it for achieving fast coherent energy transfer via quantum walk dynamics that are highly robust to disorder .",
    "we consider quantized vibrational modes , or phonons , which are coupled to a network of two - level molecules where an electronic excitation of the molecules ( exciton ) is transferred .",
    "when electronic coherence rapidly decays by relaxation of a large number of phonon modes , or bath , the exciton tends to move downhill in energy through the molecules  @xcite . here , the incoherent transfer of an exciton has previously been investigated with various phonon bath models , including local phonon baths , where each molecule is coupled to an independent phonon bath  @xcite , and a shared phonon bath , where different molecules are coupled to the same phonon modes  @xcite .",
    "however , recent advances in experimental techniques have made it possible to observe more complex behavior in the quantum regime for engineered structures  @xcite and biological systems  @xcite . for a shared phonon bath",
    ", the coherent transfer of an exciton has been investigated in the equilibrium regime , @xmath0 , where the relaxation rate @xmath1 of phonons to an equilibrium state is faster than the dipole coupling @xmath2 between molecules  @xcite .",
    "coherent exciton transfer has also been studied for the case that @xmath3 where the phonons relax from a nonequilibrium to an equilibrium state during the exciton transfer  @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium behavior of phonons has also been considered in the internal electron transfer in a molecule  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these earlier studies , here we investigate the exciton transfer through a chain of molecules in the nonequilibrium regime , @xmath4 , where the shared phonon is in a nonequilibrium state during the exciton transfer .",
    "open quantum systems have their internal energy levels shifted when they interact with an environment - the so - called lamb shift , which takes place in a wide range of systems  @xcite .",
    "the shift can even become time - dependent if the environment fluctuates temporally , _",
    "e.g. _ the ac stark effect , where oscillating electric fields cause a temporal shift in energy  @xcite .",
    "an example relevant to this work is that of a strongly coupled system of an exciton and a phonon . here , the transfer of the exciton between dipole - interacting molecules causes the phonon to be in a nonequilibrium state , which leads to fluctuations in the energy levels of the molecules supporting the excitonic transfer . in this paper , we investigate a time - dependent lamb shift induced by phonon modes that are shared by the interacting molecules , causing the energy - level fluctuations of the molecules to become highly correlated .",
    "we consider the non - adiabatic regime where the frequency of the phonons @xmath5 is comparable in magnitude to the dipole coupling @xmath2 between the molecules .",
    "thus , we consider the nonequilibrium and non - adiabatic regime , @xmath6 , where the shared phonon is in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "we find that the resonance conditions for the exciton transfer are dynamically satisfied as a direct consequence of this time - dependent lamb shift due to phonon dynamics .",
    "this leads to interesting energy transport features : ( a ) excitonic hopping between molecules is dynamically conditioned ( dynamic resonance ) , ( b ) the exciton transfer can be biased toward a particular direction ( directionality ) , and ( c ) the exciton moves rapidly by interfering with itself ( quantum walk ) .",
    "we show that this mechanism , which we call phonon - induced dynamic resonance energy transfer ( dret ) , enables long - range energy transport combined with quantum speed - up , even in the presence of considerable disorder in molecular energies .",
    "we also consider the case that @xmath7 where dret and incoherent transfer take place concurrently due to the relaxation of a shared phonon bath .",
    "we find that despite the detrimental effects of phonon relaxation and thermal noise , dret can enhance exciton transfer in disordered systems by exploiting an interplay between quantum delocalization and classical funneling .",
    "our work shows that sharing phonons between neighboring molecules not only protects quantum coherence  @xcite , similar in spirit to decoherence - free subspaces  @xcite , but also enables the use of quantum coherence for long - range energy transport in highly disordered systems .",
    "our results highlight some interesting possibilities for future hybrid quantum phononic systems , with the features of the described mechanism potentially opening up new functionalities for designing quantum transport devices and networks .",
    "in both classical and quantum energy transport systems , resonance ( energy - momentum matching ) plays a vital role . in classical transport , with a phonon environment present , resonant incoherent energy transfer occurs for a downhill energy gradient , a mechanism well known as frster resonance energy transfer ( fret )  @xcite .",
    "once an exciton hops incoherently from a high to a low energy molecule , the energy difference is dissipated by phonon relaxation , leading to funneling of the exciton through the molecules . however , in the presence of local energetic traps , due to disorder in the energy levels of the molecules , downhill diffusion leads to trapping of the exciton at the energetic minima , suppressing long - range energy transport . in quantum transport , on the other hand , resonant coherent energy transfer from a donor to an acceptor molecule",
    "occurs in the absence of energy - level mismatches , as shown in figure  [ figure1](a ) . in the presence of disorder",
    "the transfer then becomes non - resonant and again long - range energy transport is suppressed .",
    "we now show that when different molecules are coupled to the same phonon , the resonance conditions for quantum transport can be satisfied by the dynamics of the phonon , even in the presence of significant disorder in molecular energies .",
    "such sharing of a phonon between molecules has been experimentally observed for engineered polymer systems  @xcite and natural photosynthetic complexes  @xcite .",
    "consider the case where phonon relaxation is absent and the total energy of an excitonic polaron system is conserved . for a chain of @xmath8 molecules ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the single - exciton manifold is @xmath9 with @xmath10 a single - exciton state where molecule @xmath11 is excited and all other molecules are in their ground states , @xmath12 is the excitonic polaron energy operator and @xmath13 is the dipolar coupling responsible for exciton hopping . the operator @xmath12 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the excited energy of molecule @xmath11 and @xmath5 is the frequency of the phonon mode associated with position @xmath16 and momentum @xmath17 .",

    "we assume that the total system is initially in the state @xmath26 at time @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the initial single - exciton state and @xmath29 is the ground state of the phonon defined by @xmath30 .",

    "then the phonon is in a nonequilibrium state , moving along an equal energy contour @xmath53 in phase space of momentum @xmath54 and position @xmath55 , as shown in figures  [ figure1](b ) and ( c ) . here",

    "this is the case at an intersection ( point ( ii ) in figure 1(c ) ) between two contours @xmath53 and @xmath64 .",
    "it is notable that the momentum @xmath54 is also conserved there .",
    "this energy - momentum matching is temporally conditioned by the phonon motion on two energy surfaces @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( _ cf_.  figures  [ figure1](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "we call such temporal matching of energy and momentum _ dynamic resonance_. this is in contrast to static resonance when the donor and acceptor are always resonant ( energy - matching ) ( _ cf_.  figure  [ figure1](a ) ) . during the period of dynamic resonance",
    "there is a possibility to increase the hopping probability close to unity , depending on the dipolar coupling strength @xmath37 , whereas otherwise such a possibility is prohibited . when the acceptor becomes excited , the phonon moves along contour @xmath64",
    "this leads to temporal oscillations in @xmath56 and non - resonance of the exciton transfer until the phonon arrives at another intersection ( point ( iv ) ) .",
    "this phonon - induced dynamic resonance energy transfer ( dret ) takes place even in the presence of electronic energy mismatches @xmath67 . in the presence of the mismatch ,",
    "the radii of equal energy contours are different , as shown in figure  [ figure1](c ) , which leads to an asymmetry in the time evolution of the populations of the molecules , such that the exciton stays at the lower energy molecule 2 for longer , as shown in figure  [ figure1](d ) .",
    "it is remarkable that dret is immune to variations of system parameters as far as the contours @xmath53 and @xmath64 intersect .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ figure1](c ) , the red contour @xmath53 starts at the origin of the phase space when an exciton is initially created at molecule 1 .",
    "the radius of the contour is thus determined by the equilibrium position @xmath68 .",

    "@xmath25 ) , the two contours remain intersecting over a wide range of electronic energy mismatches @xmath73 .",

    "the energy of the excitonic polaron is partially transferred from the exciton to the phonon and back again without dissipation in order to allow the transfer to take place .",
    "this reversible exchange of energy enables efficient energy transfer even in rugged electronic energy landscapes with energetic traps , as shown in figure  [ figure2 ] . here",
    "we consider a three - molecule linear chain with @xmath76 and @xmath43 where an exciton is initially localized at molecule 1 and it is transferred through a rugged electronic energy landscape with @xmath77 , implying that molecule 2 is an energetic barrier and molecules 1 and 3 are nonresonant . in the absence of a shared phonon , an exciton is localized at the initial molecule in a rugged landscape due to the non - resonance arising from the energy - level mismatches between initial molecule 1 and the other molecules , as shown in figure  [ figure2](a ) . in the presence of a shared phonon ,",
    "on the other hand , when the exciton hops from low energy molecule 1 to high energy molecule 2 , the electronic energy is increased ( @xmath78 ) , while the potential energy of the phonon is decreased @xmath79 due to the change of the equilibrium position of the phonon mode ( @xmath80 ) . in an opposite way ,",
    "when the exciton hops from high energy molecule 2 to low energy molecule 3 , the electronic energy is decreased ( @xmath81 ) , while the potential energy of the phonon is increased .",
