    "quasars which are gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies are important for many different topics in astrophysics and cosmology . these range from determination of the hubble constant ( refsdal 1964 ; see e.g. kochanek & schechter 2004 ; jackson 2007 for reviews ) to the study of the individual lens systems .",
    "these studies can be divided into studies of the lensing galaxies , in particular the determination of their dark - matter content and distribution ; and studies of the quasars , in which we can probe intrinsically faint objects because of the lensing magnification .",
    "studies of the lensing galaxies use the positions and flux densities of the lensed quasar images , which probe the gravitational potential at points where the corresponding light ray cuts the lens plane . in favourable cases , constraints on the lens potential",
    "can be obtained , notably in the case of class  b1933 + 503 where three components of the background object are lensed ( sykes et al .",
    "1998 ; nair 1998 ; cohn et al .",
    "2001).often , however , it is found that smooth models fail to reproduce the observed image fluxes .",
    "this was first noted by mao & schneider ( 1998 ) in the case of class  b1422 + 231 , and subsequently the effect was studied in samples of quadruple quasar lens systems ( dalal & kochanek 2002 , kochanek & dalal 2004 , metcalf 2002 , chiba 2002 ) .",
    "the lack of a good fit is often ascribed to the presence of dark substructure , on scales ranging down to @xmath1 , which is predicted by cdm simulations ( e.g. diemand et al .",
    "fluxes are more sensitive to small - scale irregularities in the mass field than image positions , because they are dependent on the second rather than the first derivative of the potential , although sometimes accurate position information can not be well fit ( e.g. class  b0128 + 437 ; phillips et al . 2000 ,",
    "biggs et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the predicted substructure is apparently not seen in our own galaxy , a phenomenon known as the `` missing - satellites problem '' ( moore et al . 1999 , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) , and it may be that star formation in galactic satellites is suppressed ( bullock et al .",
    "in lensing galaxies , the `` substructure '' detected through lensing actually exceeds that predicted by cdm , because in the central regions where lensing constraints are available , the substructure fraction is expected to be @xmath2% ( mao et al .",
    "2004 ; xu et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the investigation of flux anomalies in lens systems is currently plagued by small - sample statistics , because the most suitable lens systems for study are those relatively small numbers of objects where radio , or other low - frequency , measurements are currently obtainable .",
    "the low - frequency emission comes from regions of the source which are relatively extended , and consequently are not subject to microlensing by the stars in the intervening galaxy , which affects the optical fluxes ( e.g. schechter & wambsganss 2002 ) , or by optical extinction effects . the only effects present , if microlensing is excluded , are the effects of the mass distribution of the lens , together with the combined effect of variability in the source together with relative time delays in pthe images .",
    "there may also be mild effects of scattering ( koopmans et al .",
    "unfortunately , however , only a dozen radio - loud , quadruply imaged quasars are known , mostly from the class survey ( myers et al .",
    "2003 , browne et al . 2003 ) but also from deep radio images of less radio - loud sources ( e.g. kratzer et al .",
    "many authors have attempted to use mid - infrared fluxes instead ( chiba et al . 2005 , fadely & keeton 2010 ) as an alternative waveband to study radio - quiet quadruple lens systems , and several further flux - anomalous systems have been detected in this way . in the future , however , the advent of very sensitive radio interferometers such as the evla and e - merlin , which have microjansky sensitivity levels coupled with sub - arcsecond resolution , will allow study of hitherto `` radio - quiet '' radio sources .",
    "it has been shown by stacking of images from the first survey ( white et al .",
    "2007 ) that typical radio - quiet quasars of optical @xmath3 magnitudes of 18 - 20 should have radio flux densities of a few tens of @xmath0jy up to @xmath4150@xmath0jy , very suitable for studies with the new radio arrays . in principle , nearly a hundred new lens systems with known radio flux densities could be found by radio follow - up of known radio - quiet lens systems .",
    "studies of the sources are also potentially rewarding , because the lensing magnification allows us to study quasars at flux density levels which we would otherwise not be able to reach .",
    "for example , it is not yet known whether the radio emission mechanism in radio - quiet quasars is similar to that in radio - loud quasars , with a compact core in which jet - like emission is collimated , or whether some other mechanism such as optically - thin free - free emission is at work ( blundell & kuncic 2007 ) .",
    "detailed studies of the radio emission , or comparison of variability properties in radio and optical , may help here .",
    "however , the radio - faintness of many radio - quiet quasars is a challenge even for modern radio arrays such as the evla , and routine observations of these objects may be greatly assisted by choosing a lensed sample containing quasars which are magnified , typically by factors of 510 .",
    "as a beginning to such a programme , we present new , deep evla observations of the lensed quasar sdss  j1004 + 4112 .",
    "this system consists of a @xmath5 quasar being lensed by a galaxy cluster at @xmath6 into five images , with a maximum separation of 146 , and was discovered in the sloan quasar lens survey ( inada et al .",
    "2003 ; oguri et al . 2004 ; inada et al .",
    "2005 ) using the catalogue of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( schneider et al .",
    "it has been modelled by numerous authors ( williams & saha 2004 , kawano & oguri 2006 , saha et al .",
    "2007 , fohlmeister et al .",
    "2007 , liesenborgs et al .",
    "2009 , oguri 2010 ) using constraints including multiple time delays ( fohlmeister et al . 2007 , 2008 ) , spectroscopy of galaxies in the cluster ( sharon et al . 2005 ) , and _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations ( ota et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the magnifications of the images are likely to be considerable , with the exception of the central image , e : oguri ( 2010 ) estimates the image magnifications to be 29.7 , 19.6 , 11.6 , 5.8 and 0.16 for a , b , c , d and e respectively .",
    "optical microlensing is known to exist in this system ( fohlmeister et al .",
    "2008 ) and has been used to determine an approximate size for the accretion disk in the source quasar .",
    "observations were obtained on 4 epochs : 2010 october 15 , 2010 november 15 , 18 , 20 , using the extended very large array ( evla ) in c - configuration .",
    "each observation consisted of 9@xmath7370-s scans within a total observing time of 90 minutes , interspersed with observations of a phase calibrator ( j0948 + 4039 ) .",
    "this resulted in a total time on source of just under 4 hours .",
    "3c286 was used as an absolute flux calibrator ( baars et al .",
    "all observations were carried out in two contiguous , 128-mhz if bands , each divided into 64 channels , and centred at 4896 and 5024  mhz .",
    "the data were processed in the nrao aips package .",
    "significant phase slopes across the bandpass were present , which were corrected by fringe fitting to the 3c286 observations . the resulting delay and rate solutions , consisting of delays of typically a few ns ,",
    "were applied to the phase calibrator j0948 + 4039 to check their validity .",
    "a few channels at the edge of each if were deleted , and a bandpass solution was made , again using 3c286 .",
    "phase calibration solutions were then derived using j0948 + 4039 . in some epochs the atmospheric phase varied by up to a radian during the observation , but this could be followed well by the phase calibration observations .",
    "images were made using the aips imagr routine using briggs robust=0 weighting ; natural weighting was also attempted but this produced no noticeable improvement in the signal - to - noise while degrading the beam considerably .",
    "the final images have a resolution of 395 @xmath7 369 in position angle 58@xmath8 . and",
    "the off - source noise level is approximately 3.8@xmath0jy / beam .",
    "the cleaned map is reproduced in fig . 1 , superimposed upon an archival hst image ( go-10509 , pi kochanek ) .",
    "the four bright images of the quasar ( a - d ) are all clearly detected , although the a and b images are only marginally resolved from each other .",
    "all the radio components have flux densities between 15 and 35 @xmath0jy ( table 1 ) .",
    "no radio emission is seen from the main lensing galaxy g , which is also known to contain a faint fifth optical image e. a much brighter radio source , r , is seen about 25 arcsec north of g. this has a flux density of 1.4  mjy , but is only marginally visible , at about 0.5  mjy , in the first 1.4-ghz image ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "it is therefore either highly variable , or else an inverted - spectrum source with @xmath9 .",

    "the acam camera was used and images were obtained in two colours , corresponding to the sloan @xmath12 and @xmath13 filters with 2@xmath7300s exposure in each filter . the @xmath13 image is presented in fig . 2 and the image flux densities , together with the evla radio flux densities , are shown in table 1 .",

    "note the relatively much brighter image c compared to the radio image in fig .",
    "the current observations are the first of a programme which may tell us much both about the lenses and the lensed quasar .",
    "the lens can be probed by knowing the intrinsic long - wavelength flux ratios , together with other constraints from previous observations .",
    "the nature of the quasar s radio source can be probed by its flux density at different wavelengths , and also by its variability properties in the optical and radio wavebands .      in principle , radio observations tell us the intrinsic flux ratios without interference from microlensing effects or extinction . if the radio source is not variable , then the radio flux ratios are consistent with models ( see table 1 ) except for component d , which is relatively bright .",
    "the picture can be complicated by the combined effects of variability and time delay , and in this case also by possible differences in variability characteristics in the two wavebands .",
    "fohlmeister et al .",
    "( 2008 ) present optical monitoring of sdss  j1004 + 4112 for nearly four years from the end of 2003 until the middle of 2007 .",
    "flux variations in the five images are expected to proceed in the order c - b - a - d - e , where the c - a and b - a time delays have been measured by fohlmeister et al .",
    "( 2008 ) as 821.6@xmath142.1 days and 40.6@xmath141.8 days , respectively ; they also obtained a lower limit on the a - d delay of 1250 days .",
    "model predictions for this delay include 1218 days by oguri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and @xmath42000 days by fohlmeister et al .",
    "fohlmeister et al .",
    "obtain delay - corrected flux ratios of b to a that vary from 0.283 to 0.460 mag due to microlensing , and in c to a of 0.59 mag .",
    "comparison of the wht optical photometry of 2011 february with fohlmeister et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , whose photometry covers the period 2004 - 07 , implies that components a and b have continued to decline in brightness by about half a magnitude in the last three years",
    ". it will be important to use radio observations to derive intrinsic flux ratios free from the effects of microlensing , using further observations separated by the c - b and c - a time delays in the system .",
    "the detection of significant radio flux density , albeit at a low level , from sdss  j1004 + 4112 vindicates the prediction of white et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that hitherto `` radio - quiet '' quasars should display significant radio flux when imaged with noise levels of a few @xmath0jy , which are now within reach using new radio interferometer arrays such as the evla and e - merlin .",
    "it also suggests that the correlation between @xmath3-band and cm - wave radio flux density inferred by white et al . continues down to considerably lower flux density levels than can be probed by first .",
    "moreover , the high magnification of this lens system implies that the intrinsic flux of the radio source is between 1 and 2@xmath0jy , using the model of oguri ( 2010 ) .",
    "this is probably the lowest intrinsic flux density of any source yet detected in the radio .",
    "the current faintest radio sources include the lensed submillimetre galaxy smmj16359 + 6612 , detected in deep wsrt observations by garrett , knudsen & van der werf ( 2005 ) and a lensed radio source in the cluster ms0451.6@xmath110305 ( berciano alba et al .",
    "2007 ) , both of which have unlensed flux densities of about 3@xmath0jy .",
    "similar , or slightly brighter , detections have been reported in other lensed submillimetre galaxies ( e.g. ivison et al .",
    "other faint radio lenses may emerge from candidates in the cosmos field ( faure et al . 2008 , jackson 2008 ) in which deep radio maps have been made ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2007 ) but no other lensed quasars are yet reported with such low intrinsic radio fluxes .",
    "such a radio source , if unlensed , would require about a week of observing time using the evla when it is fully completed with the full 2-ghz bandwidth , in order to achieve a significant detection . in this object , we can therefore use gravitational lensing for detailed study of an intrinsically weak radio source at a level which will only become routine in unlensed sources with the advent of the square kilometre array in the next decade .",
    "one immediate objective that can be resolved soon is the variability of the radio source .",
    "the pattern of the radio source variability depends on the nature of the radio source , and in particular whether radio - quiet quasars such as sdss  j1004 + 4112 produce radio emission with a standard black - hole / jet , as in stronger sources , or with a different mechanism such as optically - thin free - free emission ( blundell & kuncic 2007 ) from a disk wind . in the latter case",
    "we might expect radio variability to be associate with the variability of the optical emission from and around the disk .",
    "variability properties of such faint quasars are unknown , although barvainis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find similar variability properties in samples of radio - loud quasars and quasars with radio flux densities @xmath41  mjy .",
    "a remarkable feature of the present observations is the relative brightness of c compared to the other components in the 2011 february optical observations , being then 0.24 mag brighter than a , despite the november 2010 radio flux being less than that of a by a factor of approximately 2 .",
    "a 1-magnitude brightening in such a short period has not previously been seen in optical monitoring data .",
    "either c is currently undergoing a high- magnitude microlensing event , or a high - amplitude episode of intrinsic variability is currently taking place .",
    "the evla is operated by the national radio astronomy observatory , a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
