    "energy extraction from black holes has interest in its own as fundamentals of black holes but also as an astrophysical engine sourcing large energetic jets or gamma ray bursts .",

    "can be extracted from a rotating black hole through particle fission : initially a particle enters the ergosphere and then splits into two particles , one of them , on a negative energy orbit , falls into the spinning black hole , the other escapes to infinity with more energy than the original particle , while the black hole losses some of its angular momentum .",
    "the process relies on the existence of a region , outside the horizon , where negative energy orbits are allowed but such that particles still can escape from black hole .",
    "this region is called the ergosphere . in kerr black hole",
    "the ergosphere extends from the horizon to the static limit . besides the rotating black holes",
    ", energy can be extracted from charged black holes @xcite , as a result of the black hole charge interaction with the physical parameters of the interacting particles or fields .",
    "denardo and ruffini ( 1973 ) @xcite defined this region as the _ effective ergosphere_. the extension of the effective ergosphere depends on the sign and magnitude of the test charge .",

    "it turns out that up to the 50 % of the total charge of an extreme rn black hole can be extracted .",
    "being charged black holes so a promising energy extraction source , it is important to determine how much energy can be extracted from other than rn black holes .",
    "the existence of astrophysical charged black holes has been questioned , however black holes with fields of the order of the critical field to polarize vacuum can be important in finding an explanation for ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite or the modeling of gamma - ray bursts @xcite . a very high energy electromagnetic field fails to obey maxwell s electrodynamics and to give a reliable description of such scenarios quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) should be employed . in this direction",

    "born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics @xcite outstands among nonlinear electromagnetic ( nlem ) theories for several reasons , namely , bi can be considered as an effective theory that takes into account quantum electromagnetic effects , for instance vacuum polarization or light by light dispersion , to the tree - level approximation in qed @xcite .",
    "another reason is that bi lagrangian arises in the low - energy limit in string theory and bi solutions can be interpreted as d - branes @xcite .",
    "moreover , on a d3-brane , open strings attached to the brane may couple to a @xmath2 field at the end of the string while the string tension is related to the bi parameter @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the energy extraction from a ebi black hole is analyzed determining the extension of its ergosphere as well as the extractable energy using the irreducible mass concept ; the nlem behavior is compared with the einstein - maxwell one .",
    "it turned out that the energy that can be extracted from the ebi black hole is alwyas less that the one extractable from rn black hole , having the former as its upper limit the latter .",
    "the extreme black hole is investigated as well , presenting remarkable features ; in principle more energy can be extracted from extreme ebi black hole than from extreme rn , however the lacking of a linear limit of the extreme bi black hole may be an inconvenient . some comments are included about another energy extraction process , namely , superradiance from the ebi black hole .",

    "the linear limit is the maxwell lagrangian , given by @xmath10    very soon after the bi proposal came up it was realized that euler - heisenberg and schwinger @xcite lagrangians in qed are related to bi lagrangian , more precisely , qed lagrangian at the tree - level expansion can be derived in the weak - field limit from the bi lagrangian i.e. bi lagrangian may be considered an effective lagrangian of qed vacuum polarization .",

    ", there are many extreme ebi - bhs but all of them for @xmath108 ; consequently , in such cases the rn counterpart is a naked singularity , because rn horizon turns out to be complex , since the square root is imaginary , @xmath119 .",

    "regarding energy extraction by means of the superradiance process , it was determined that the frequency range of the impinging wave upon the ebi - bh for the occurrence of superradiance is smaller than the corresponding to rn - bh .    in summary",
    ", it has been shown that the introduction of a nonlinear electromagnetic field of the bi kind reduces the black hole ability to render energy through extraction processes based on its charge , as compared with rn black hole .",
