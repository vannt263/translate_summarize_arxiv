    "we consider the two user multiple access relay channel ( marc ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : marc ] . source nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 want to transmit messages to the destination node @xmath2 with the help of the relay node @xmath9 all the nodes are assumed to have half - duplex constraint , i.e. , the nodes can not transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band .",
    "in addition to the presence of direct link , communication paths exist from the source nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the destination node @xmath10 via the relay node @xmath9 as a result , in a two user marc channel , a diversity order of two can be achieved , if the transmission scheme is chosen properly .      in a wireless network , due to the superposition nature of the wireless channel ,",
    "signals interfere at the nodes . avoiding this interference by making",
    "the nodes transmit in orthogonal time / frequency slots incurs a loss of spectral efficiency .",
    "the concept of physical layer network coding , in which the nodes are allowed to transmit simultaneously resulting in interference , was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "physical layer network coding ( pnc ) has been shown to outperform traditional schemes which involve orthogonal transmissions @xcite@xcite .",
    "so far , most of the works on physical layer network coding have mainly focussed only on the two - way relay channel . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme based on pnc for the marc .    in a two - way relay channel , in order to ensure unique decodability at the end nodes , the network coding maps used at the relay node should satisfy a condition called the exclusive law @xcite .",
    "these maps satisfying the exclusive law form a mathematical structure called latin squares and the properties of latin squares have been used to obtain the network coding maps in a two - way relay channel @xcite@xcite .",
    "an interesting connection between the proposed pnc scheme for the marc and the two - way relay channel is that the network coding map used at @xmath3 needs to satisfy the exclusive law , for the proposed pnc scheme for the marc to achieve a maximum diversity order two .",
    "wireless relay networks , in which the relay nodes decode the messages are prone to loss of diversity order , due to the forwarding of erroneous messages .",
    "various methods have been proposed in the literature to avoid this loss of diversity order .",
    "cyclic redundancy check bits are used so that the nodes forward only those packets which are decoded correctly @xcite .",
    "some works assume the knowledge of all the instantaneous fade coefficients or error probabilities associated with the intermediate nodes at the destination node , with the decoder at the destination using this knowledge to ensure full diversity @xcite,@xcite .",
    "another method used widely is to use a scaling factor at the relay nodes which depends on the fade coefficients , with the scaling factor indicated to the destination using pilot symbols @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the proposed scheme does not suffer from the disadvantages of any of the above methods , yet ensures maximum diversity order .",
    "this is achieved by means of an efficient choice of the transmission scheme and a novel decoder used at the destination @xmath11    a complex field network coding ( cfnc ) scheme for the marc was proposed in @xcite . in this paper , as an alternative , we propose a pnc scheme . as observed in @xcite , when @xmath3 transmits a many - to - one function of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s transmission during the relaying phase and minimum squared euclidean distance decoder employed at @xmath2 , a loss of diversity order results . in this paper , we show that for the proposed pnc scheme , making the source nodes also transmit during the relaying phase , combined with a novel decoder which is not minimum squared euclidean distance decoder , ensures the maximum possible diversity order of two .",
    "furthermore , if certain parameters are chosen properly , the proposed decoder for the pnc scheme can be implemented with a decoding complexity order same as that of the cfnc scheme .    1.7 in   [ fig : phase1 ]    1.7 in   [ fig",
    ": phase2 ]    the following are the main advantages of the proposed pnc scheme over the cfnc scheme proposed in @xcite :    * in the cfnc scheme , @xmath3 transmits a complex linear combination of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s messages and the signal set used at @xmath3 during the relaying phase has @xmath12 points , where @xmath13 is the size of the signal set used at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , since the proposed pnc scheme uses a many - to - one map , the signal set used during the relaying phase has only @xmath13 points and hence the pnc scheme is expected to perform better than the cfnc scheme , which is confirmed by the simulation results .",
    "* in the cfnc scheme , @xmath3 uses a scaling factor which is a function of the fade coefficients of the @xmath0-@xmath3 and @xmath1-@xmath3 links , which needs to be indicated to @xmath2 using pilot symbols .",

    "alternatively , we propose a novel decoder which considers the possibility of error events at @xmath3 , given by , @xmath89 where the metrics @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given in and respectively , at the top of the next page .",
    "@xmath92    ' '' ''    the idea behind the choice of this decoder is as follows : if the relay transmits the correct network - coded symbol , the optimal ml decoding metric at @xmath2 is given by @xmath93 the relay transmits a wrong network - coded symbol , independent of @xmath94 if the joint ml estimate at the relay @xmath95 is such that @xmath96 under this condition , the optimal ml decision metric at @xmath2 is given by @xmath97 the relay transmits a wrong network - coded symbol with a probability which is proportional to @xmath98 at high snr . hence to the metric @xmath99 a correction factor @xmath100 is added and the minimum of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is taken to be the decoding metric at @xmath2 .    the cfnc scheme proposed in @xcite uses minimum squared euclidean distance decoder , which has a decoding complexity of @xmath103 since the decoder given in involves minimization over three variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 it appears as though the decoding complexity order is @xmath106 in section iii , it is shown that by properly choosing the constants @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 and @xmath110 the decoding complexity order can be reduced to @xmath111 which is the same as that of the cfnc scheme .",
