    "in 1982 hagen kleinert proposed a program for systematically constructing all feynman diagrams of a field theory together with their proper weights by graphically solving a set of functional differential equations@xcite .",
    "it relies on considering a feynman diagram as a functional of its graphical elements , i.e. , its lines and vertices .",
    "functional derivatives with respect to these graphical elements are represented by removing lines or vertices of a feynman diagram in all possible ways . with these graphical operations ,",
    "the program proceeds in four steps .",
    "first , a nonlinear functional differential equation for the free energy is derived as a consequence of the field equations .",
    "subsequently , this functional differential equation is converted to a recursion relation for the loop expansion coefficients of the free energy . from its graphical solution ,",
    "the connected vacuum diagrams are constructed .",
    "finally , all diagrams of @xmath2-point functions are obtained by removing lines or vertices from the connected vacuum diagrams .",
    "this program was recently used to systematically generate all feynman diagrams of qed@xcite and of @xmath0-theory in the disordered , symmetric phase@xcite and the ordered , broken - symmetry phase@xcite .",
    "the present article reviews a modification of this program@xcite .",
    "the aim is to construct directly the feynman diagrams of @xmath2-point functions which are relevant for the renormalization of a field theory . to this end",
    "we consider the self - energy and the one - particle irreducible four - point function of the euclidean multicomponent scalar @xmath0-theory as functionals of the free correlation function . as such",
    "they obey a closed set of functional differential equations which can be turned into graphical recursion relations .",
    "these are solved order by order in the number of loops , producing all one - particle irreducible diagrams with their proper weights .",
    "a subsequent absorption of all tadpole corrections in the lines leads to modified graphical recursion relations for the tadpole - free one - particle irreducible diagrams which are needed for calculating the critical exponents with renormalization techniques in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "finally , we elucidate how our procedure is related to the method of higher functional legendre transformations which was also investigated in ref.@xcite .",

    "the energy functional ( [ pelsef ] ) describes @xmath5-dimensional euclidean @xmath0-theories generically .",
    "these are models for a family of universality classes of continuous phase transitions , such as the @xmath10-symmetric @xmath0-theory which serves to derive the critical phenomena in dilute polymer solutions ( @xmath11 ) , ising- and heisenberg - like magnets ( @xmath12 ) , and superfluids ( @xmath13 ) . in all these cases , the energy functional ( [ pelsef ] ) is specified by the bilocal kernel @xmath14 and by the quartic interaction @xmath15 where the bare mass @xmath16 is proportional to the temperature distance from the critical point , and @xmath17 denotes the bare coupling constant . in this article",
    "we leave the kernel @xmath7 in the energy functional ( [ pelsef ] ) completely general , except for the symmetry with respect to its indices , and insert the physical value ( [ pelsph1 ] ) only at the end . by doing so",
    ", we consider all statistical quantities derived from ( [ pelsef ] ) as functionals of the free correlation function @xmath18 which is the functional inverse of the kernel @xmath7 : @xmath19 this allows us to introduce functional derivatives with respect to @xmath18 whose basic rule reflects the symmetry of its indices : @xmath20 such functional derivatives are represented graphically by removing one line from a feynman diagram in all possible ways@xcite .",
    "thereby each line in a feynman diagram represents a free correlation function @xmath21 and each vertex represents an integral over the interaction @xmath22 thus the differentiation ( [ pelsdr1 ] ) is illustrated graphically as @xmath23 where the elements of feynman diagrams are extended by an open dot with two labeled line ends representing the delta function : @xmath24",

    "as has been elaborated in detail in ref.@xcite , the connected vaccum diagrams contributing to @xmath31 follow together with their weights from a graphical recursion relation which can be written diagrammatically for @xmath32 as @xmath33 this is iterated starting from the two - loop contribution @xmath34 the right - hand side of ( [ pelsgrr ] ) contains three different graphical operations .",

    "the connected vacuum diagrams resulting from the graphical recursion relation ( [ pelsgrr ] ) together with their weights are shown up to @xmath36 loops in ref.@xcite .",
    "there we observed that the nonlinear operation in ( [ pelsgrr ] ) does not lead to topologically new diagrams .",
    "it only corrects the weights generated from the first two linear operations . continuing the solution of the graphical recursion relation ( [ pelsgrr ] ) to higher loops",
    "is an arduous task .",
    "we have therefore automatized the procedure in ref.@xcite by computer algebra with the help of a unique matrix notation for feynman diagrams . the corresponding mathematica program and higher - order results up to @xmath37 are available on the internet@xcite .",

    "the question arises whether the one - particle irreducible diagrams can also be generated in a direct graphical way without any reference to the connected vacuum diagrams .",

    "we restrict ourselves to present some of the results . to this end",
    "we extend the elements of feynman diagrams by a double straight line representing the fully - interacting two - point function @xmath48 and by a @xmath49- and @xmath50-vertex with a big open dot representing the self - energy and the one - particle irreducible four - point function    @xmath51    respectively .",
