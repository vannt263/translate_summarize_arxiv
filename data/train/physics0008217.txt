    "the sns front end consists of an h@xmath0  ion source , low energy beam transport ( lebt ) , a radio frequency quadrupole ( rfq ) with 65kev injection energy and 2.5mev output energy , and a 3.6 m long medium energy beam transport ( mebt ) , that matches and chops the 2.5mev h@xmath0  beam before injection into the remainder of the sns linac @xcite .",
    "the extremely compact 65kev lebt leaves no room for conventional diagnostics .",
    "only one measurement of beam properties remains , a split - collector current measurement , that goes under the name `` lebt diagnostic . '' no beam diagnostic devices at all are included in the rfq .",
    "table [ tab - summary ] shows the instruments that will be assembled on the 2.5mev , 3.6 m long .",
    "figure [ fig - mebtoverview ] shows their placement along the beam line .",
    "this paper will discuss each of these instruments in turn .",

    "the signal processing needs for the bpm , lebt diagnostic , and bcm are similar , both among themselves and with their cousins in the larger sns project . collaborative and competitive development of electronics is underway at lbnl , lanl , and bnl .",
    "most of the relevant information can be collected with a moderate rate ( 34 - 68 mhz ) , moderate resolution ( 12 - 14 bit ) digitization of a suitably conditioned signal .",
    "we are investigating digitization and signal processing platforms that can reliably and cost - effectively deal with this volume of data , and interact with the global controls ( epics ) .",
    "that platform would then be used for all bpm , bcm , and lebt signal handling , and possibly other uses within sns .",
    "each instrument has unique analog signal conditioning requirements . for bpm processing , at least one channel of `` vector voltmeter ''",
    "is required to process beam phase information .",
    "this is expected to function with a mixer and direct if sampling .",
    "such processing can also be used for position readout .",
    "log amp circuitry is also under consideration for the actual signal strength measurements : it has a dynamic range advantage over ordinary linear analog processing .",
    "the bcm signal conditioning requirements for the front end are actually quite modest , essentially a 40db amplifier and filter .",
    "this simplicity has to be balanced against compatibility with the future bcm signal conditioning for the sns ring , where the signal has an additional 60 db of dynamic range , and turn - turn differences are important @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank all our collaborators at lanl , bnl , and ornl for their various roles in keeping this project moving .",
    "contributions from tom shea , john power , marty kesselman , pete cameron , and bob shafer have been particularly helpful ."
