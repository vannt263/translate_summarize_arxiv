    "there is currently great interest in cooling molecules to very low temperatures , motivated by a diverse range of applications @xcite .",
    "laser cooling , which has been used to cool atoms to ultracold temperatures for decades , is difficult to apply to molecules because it is necessary to address multiple vibrational branches , each requiring a separate laser . despite this difficulty",
    ", laser cooling has been demonstrated for the diatomic radicals srf @xcite , yo @xcite and caf @xcite , and most recently a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) of srf molecules was demonstrated @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the laser cooling transition was the a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 transition .",
    "the mechanism of magneto - optical trapping for these diatomic molecules has been elucidated in @xcite where rate equations are used to model the interaction of the multi - level molecules with multiple frequencies of laser light .",
    "for a two - level atom of mass @xmath2 , wavelength @xmath3 and decay rate @xmath4 , the maximum achievable acceleration is @xmath5 . using the parameters of the a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 transition of caf ,",
    "this is 290,000ms@xmath6 . for the real molecule",
    "the acceleration is greatly reduced .",
    "this is partly because the molecule has multiple levels in the ground state that all need to be driven with separate laser frequencies , and this reduces the maximum achievable scattering rate relative to that of a two - level system @xcite .",
    "this is compounded by optical pumping into states that are dark to the polarization of the laser beam that pushes displaced molecules back to the centre .",
    "finally , even in the absence of these other difficulties , the trapping forces are very weak when the upper state @xmath7-factor , @xmath8 , is much smaller than the lower state @xmath7-factor , @xmath9 @xcite . in the hund s case ( a )",
    "limit a @xmath0 state has",
    "a negligibly small @xmath7-factor and so is unsuitable for making a mot .",
    "the observed mot of srf was attributed to the mixing of the a@xmath0 state with the b@xmath1 state , resulting in a value of @xmath8 that is large enough for weak trapping @xcite .",
    "magneto - optical trapping of caf is being pursued , but given the very small value of @xmath8 in the a@xmath0 state @xcite it is unclear whether the a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 transition is suitable for the mot , or whether it is better to use the b@xmath1 - x@xmath1 transition . in this paper",
    "we explore this question and we identify a new mechanism of magneto - optical trapping that can give strong trapping forces irrespective of the upper - state @xmath7-factor , and that also side - steps the problem of optical pumping into dark states .",
    "we focus on caf , though our conclusions also apply to other molecules of interest .",
    "we model magneto - optical trapping of caf using a rate equation approach identical to that of @xcite , except that here we use the full non - linear zeeman shifts discussed below , rather than assuming linear shifts .",
    "we also use the same notation as in @xcite .",
    "the angular momenta of the lower and upper states are written as @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , their projections onto the @xmath12-axis are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and in the linear zeeman shift approximation the @xmath7-factors are @xmath9 and @xmath8 . along each coordinate axis of the mot ,",
    "molecules interact with counter - propagating beams , one pushing towards the centre ( the restoring beam ) and the other away from the centre ( the anti - restoring beam ) . in a local coordinate system , which is always aligned to the direction of the magnetic field at the position of the molecule , the polarization of the restoring beam is @xmath15 according to whether it excites @xmath16 transitions . throughout the discussion",
    "we take the field gradient in the @xmath12-direction , which is along the axis of the magnetic field coils , to be 20g / cm .",
    "the intensity distribution of the laser beams is gaussian with a @xmath17 radius of 12 mm .",
    "a useful way to summarize the trapping force of the mot is to calculate the acceleration of a stationary molecule versus its displacement along the @xmath12-axis , and the acceleration of a molecule at the centre of the mot versus its speed in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "we call these acceleration curves . for small values of the displacement , @xmath12 , and speed , @xmath18",
    ", we can write the acceleration as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the trap frequency and @xmath21 is the damping coefficient .",
    "their values provide a simple and convenient way of characterizing the mot . to find the capture velocity of the mot , @xmath22 , we consider molecules entering the mot in the xy - plane and at 45@xmath23 to the laser beams , and calculate the fastest speed a molecule can have if it is to be captured .",
    "we consider mots using both the ( 0 - 0)a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 and ( 0 - 0)b@xmath1 - x@xmath1 transitions , which we call the ` a - state mot ' and ` b - state mot ' respectively .",
    "the lower level is the first rotationally excited state of x@xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , while the upper level is the lowest energy state of positive parity in either the a@xmath0 or b@xmath1 states .",

    "we estimate @xmath60mhz and @xmath61mhz .",

    "we identify a new mechanism of magneto - optical trapping which avoids the problem of weak trapping associated with dark states and with a small @xmath8 , and which is relevant to the rest of our discussion .",
    "consider the simple system illustrated in fig.[2f](a ) , which consists of a single lower level with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , an upper level with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and two oppositely polarized frequency components with detunings @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the wavelength , linewidth and mass are set equal to our caf system .",
    "the molecule interacts with counter - propagating laser beams along each of the coordinate axes , each beam containing these two frequency components .",
    "the size of the laser beams is the same as described above , and the power per beam and per component is set to 40mw .",
    "we fix @xmath70 , and vary @xmath69 . figure [ 2f](b ) shows the trapping frequency as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath69 is positive , meaning that one component is red - detuned and the other is blue - detuned , there is a restoring force .",
    "when @xmath71 is positive the zeeman shift brings the transition into resonance with the red - detuned light , and so we have arranged for the red - detuned component of the restoring beam to drive @xmath72 transitions so that the molecule preferentially interacts with that restoring beam ( the red - detuned component of the anti - restoring beam drives @xmath73 transitions ) . when @xmath74 is negative the transition comes into resonance with the blue - detuned frequency component , and because it has the opposite polarization the molecule again preferentially scatters from the restoring beam .",
    "the restoring force is maximized when @xmath69 is about @xmath75 , but remains significant even for large positive detunings .",
    "there is no trapping when @xmath76 is between @xmath77 and @xmath78 because then the transitions are preferentially driven by the anti - restoring beams .",
    "however , for more negative detunings there is once again a restoring force . in this case , the restoring beam has one component driving @xmath72 transitions , and another driving @xmath73 transitions , with the former closer to resonance . for the anti - restoring beam ,",
    "it is the opposite .",
    "when @xmath71 is positive , only @xmath72 transitions are driven , and this is far more likely to be driven by the restoring beam since it is ( relatively ) much closer to resonance . when @xmath71 is negative , only @xmath73 transitions are driven , and this is only a little more likely to be driven by the anti - restoring beam since the relative difference in detuning is not so great .",
    "figure [ 2f](c ) shows how the damping coefficient depends on @xmath76 .",
    "cooling occurs when @xmath21 is positive .",
    "when @xmath76 is negative there is always cooling because both frequency components are red - detuned .",
    "when @xmath76 is positive and smaller than @xmath4 there is heating because the blue - detuned component is closer to resonance than the red - detuned one .",
    "when @xmath79 there is cooling again , because the red - detuned component is the one closer to resonance .",
    "together , these plots show that there is both cooling and trapping for all values of @xmath76 apart from values between 0 and @xmath78 .",
    "it also demonstrates the complexity that can arise even in this relatively simple system .",
    "we turn now to a model of a caf mot using the ( 0,0)a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 transition - the a - state mot .",
    "this transition has @xmath80 nm and @xmath81mhz @xcite .",
    "four frequency components are used to drive the four hyperfine components of the transition , and their polarizations in the restoring beam are chosen as shown in fig.[accela](a ) , which follows the recommendations of @xcite for our case where @xmath8 is negative .",
    "we neglect the small branches to higher lying vibrational states .",
    "figure [ accela](b ) shows how the acceleration of a stationary molecule depends on position for various values of the power per beam and per frequency component .",
    "here we have set the detuning of all components to @xmath78 .",
    "we expect the mot forces to be weak because of the small value of @xmath8 , but we see from the figure that this is not the case .",
    "this is because the mot forces are complicated by the close spacing of the upper @xmath82 and @xmath83 levels of the x@xmath1 state .",
    "this frequency interval is 25mhz , which is only @xmath84 . with our detuning of @xmath78 , the field - free transition from @xmath64",
    "is driven ( mainly ) by two oppositely polarized components , one detuned by @xmath78 and the other by @xmath85 .",
    "the polarizations of these components are exactly as in the model system of fig.[2f](a ) , and fig.[2f](b ) tells us that this configuration produces a trapping force . near the centre of the mot it is this transition which is mainly responsible for the restoring force .",
    "further from the centre , there is a strong additional trapping force coming from the upper @xmath86 transition . at a field of about 30 g",
    "the @xmath87 component of this transition comes into resonance with the laser component that is meant to drive @xmath64 , while the @xmath88 component comes into resonance with the laser component intended for @xmath89 .",
    "once again , the two laser components are polarized correctly so that the transitions from @xmath87 and @xmath88 are both driven by the restoring beam .",
    "this contribution to the trapping force pushes the turning point of the acceleration curve further out from the centre of the mot , generating a large mot capture volume .",
    "we also see from figure [ accela](b ) that the acceleration continues to increase as the laser power is increased up to 100mw .",
    "figure [ accela](c ) shows how the acceleration of a molecule at the mot centre depends on its speed , for the same set of laser powers as before .",
    "we see that this damping force peaks when the speed is near 5 m/s , corresponding to a doppler shift that equals the detuning of @xmath78 .",
    "there is also a secondary peak where the doppler shift is @xmath90 , which is again the result of there being two frequency components spaced by @xmath84 .",
    "this acts to broaden out the acceleration curve so that the damping force remains significant over a larger range of speeds .",
    "figures [ accela](d ) and ( e ) show how the acceleration depends on position and speed for various values of the detuning , with the power fixed at 40mw . bringing the detuning close to zero maximizes the trapping force in this case , but a negative detuning is required for there to be a damping force and so there is a trade - off between cooling and trapping .",
    "when the detuning is @xmath78 and the power is 40mw we find @xmath91hz , @xmath92s@xmath93 and @xmath94 m/s .",
    "we attribute the strong restoring forces shown in fig.[accela](b , d ) almost entirely to the dual - frequency effect . to verify this",
    ", we make the intervals between the four components of the transition much larger than @xmath4 , setting the detuning to @xmath78 and the power per beam and per frequency to 40mw .",
    "then , we find a very simple dependence of the mot forces on @xmath8 : over the range @xmath95 , the maximum acceleration is @xmath96 and the squared trapping frequency is @xmath97 .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath98 dictates only the required sign of the field gradient .",
    "these relationships could also be applied to other similar molecules , suitably scaled by the ratio of the maximum scattering rates . for our present case , @xmath99 , and",
    "so the maximum acceleration is only 357m / s@xmath100 and the trap frequency is 41hz .",
    "we find similar results if we set the intervals between the four components equal to their true values , and also set the polarization handedness of the laser components all equal instead of the way they are shown in fig.[accela](a ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the large increase in the mot forces brought about by the dual - frequency arrangement .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether the trapping forces can be increased even further by applying the dual frequency method to several of the hyperfine components .",
    "figure [ 2f ] shows that when @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the trapping and damping forces are both strong , so we can aim to arrange this situation for several of the hyperfine components .",
    "because the @xmath64 and upper @xmath86 components are spaced by @xmath84 we automatically have this ideal situation for the @xmath64 state , as discussed above , but this means that we can not _ also _ have it for the upper @xmath86 state .",
    "the @xmath89 state has no zeeman splitting and no dark states , so there is nothing to be gained from applying two oppositely polarized frequency components .",
    "this leaves the lower @xmath86 state .",
    "because this has a negative @xmath7-factor , the zeeman shift of the @xmath74 states are opposite to the way they are drawn in fig.[2f](a ) , and so the polarizations of the two frequency components need to be reversed relative to that figure .",
    "these arguments lead us to add one more frequency to address the lower @xmath86 level , detuned by 2@xmath4 from this level and polarized @xmath103 , giving us the set of five frequencies and polarizations illustrated in the inset of fig.[accelaextra ] .",
    "figure [ accelaextra](a ) gives the acceleration versus position when the laser power is 40mw in each beam and frequency component .",
    "the addition of the extra component more than doubles the maximum acceleration to 12000ms@xmath6 , and the trap frequency increases to @xmath104hz .",
    "figure [ accelaextra](b ) shows the acceleration versus speed for this case .",
    "we find that the additional component has little effect on the damping coefficient or the maximum damping force , but it does narrow down significantly the range of velocities where there is damping .",
    "in fact , the force has the wrong sign for speeds between 8 and 15 m/s because , when in the lower @xmath86 level , the molecule is doppler shifted into resonance with the extra frequency component of the _ co - propagating _ beam . as a result",
    ", the capture velocity decreases to @xmath105 m/s .",
    "these results suggest that a good strategy may be to first load the mot using four frequency components , and then switch on the fifth to provide tighter confinement .",

    "next , we model a mot using the ( 0 - 0)b@xmath1 - x@xmath1 transition - the b - state mot .",
    "this transition has @xmath106 nm and @xmath107mhz .",
    "population that leaks into other vibrational states of x@xmath1 can be rapidly pumped back into the cooling cycle via the a@xmath0 state .",
    "these re - pumping transitions contribute very little to the cooling and trapping forces of the mot , and so we neglect them in our model .",
    "four laser frequency components address the four transitions from the x@xmath1 state , all with a common detuning .",
    "their polarizations in the restoring beam are indicated in fig.[accelb](a ) , following the recommendations of @xcite for a positive @xmath8 .",
    "we can choose whether to excite the transition to @xmath108 or @xmath109 , which are spaced by 20mhz .",
    "the transition strengths are given in fig.[accelb](a ) .",
    "we note that @xmath108 decays to the lower @xmath82 level 95% of the time .",
    "if the laser is tuned close to resonance with this transition , the combination of the resonance condition and the stronger transition strength strongly favors excitation to @xmath108 , and so these two levels can form a nearly - closed transition .",
    "our model shows that this produces a high scattering rate and strong damping , but contributes little to the trapping force .",
    "therefore , we choose to drive all @xmath10 components to @xmath109 .",
    "figure [ accelb](b ) shows the acceleration versus position of stationary molecules for four different values of the power in each beam and frequency component .",
    "the detuning is @xmath78 .",
    "the curves have turning points near the position where the largest zeeman shifts are equal to this detuning .",
    "further out , the acceleration crosses zero because the zeeman shifts become comparable to the upper state hyperfine interval and because of level crossings between the @xmath82 and 2 levels . the peak acceleration roughly triples as the power",
    "is increased from 5 to 40 mw , but does not increase much for powers exceeding 40 mw .",
    "this differs from the a - state mot which requires more power to obtain the highest force .",

    "the curves are similar to those shown in fig.[accela](c ) for the a - state mot , except that the range of speeds that give a damping force is reduced .",
    "the light is red - detuned by 6.4mhz for excitation to @xmath109 , and so it is blue - detuned by 13.6mhz for excitation to @xmath108 .",
    "when the speed is 7 m/s the doppler shift is 13mhz , bringing the _ co - propagating _ light into resonance with the transitions to @xmath108 , and thus making the net force positive at this speed .",
    "this will limit the capture velocity of the mot .",
    "figure [ accelb](d ) shows acceleration versus position for various detunings , @xmath110 , with the power per beam and frequency component set to 40 mw . as @xmath111 increases the turning point of the acceleration curve shifts to larger displacements , because this turning point occurs roughly where the zeeman shift matches the detuning .",
    "the peak restoring force is greatest when the detuning is approximately @xmath78 .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath111 reduces this peak force , just as it does in a simple one dimensional theory of the mot @xcite .",
    "a larger value of @xmath111 also reduces the peak restoring force , which differs from the simple mot theory , probably because of the different zeeman tunings of the states involved .",
    "figure [ accelb](e ) shows the acceleration versus speed for the same set of detunings .",
    "we note that a larger detuning shifts the point where the acceleration crosses zero to higher speeds .",

    "this shows that the dual - frequency effect discussed in sec.[sec : dual ] does not play a major role in this mot .",
    "as for the a - state mot , it is worth trying to engineer a stronger trapping force by using the dual - frequency effect .",
    "our modelling suggests that a good way to do this is to add one extra frequency component with @xmath118 polarization , detuned by @xmath85 from the upper @xmath82 level .",
    "figure [ accelbextra ] shows the acceleration versus position and speed for this arrangement .",
    "the detunings and polarizations are illustrated in the inset .",
    "with 40mw in each frequency component , the addition of this extra component increases the maximum trapping force by about 50% , and the trap frequency increases to @xmath119hz .",
    "the damping coefficient and maximum damping force are almost unchanged .",
    "however , the damping force now has the wrong sign for all speeds between 5.7 and 15 m/s , and this positive force is larger than before .",
    "this is due to the doppler shift bringing the extra frequency component of the co - propagating beam into resonance , in addition to the the transitions to @xmath108 being doppler - shifted into resonance as explained above .",
    "consequently , the capture velocity decreases to @xmath120 m/s .",
    "let us now summarize our findings .",
    "we find similar trapping forces in the a - state mot and the b - state mot .",
    "for the b - state mot , when the detuning is @xmath78 and the power is 40mw , the maximum acceleration of a stationary molecule is 4800m / s@xmath100 , the trapping frequency is @xmath121hz , the damping coefficient is @xmath122s@xmath93 , and the capture velocity is @xmath114 m/s . for the a - state mot , with the same parameters ,",
    "the maximum acceleration of a stationary molecule is 5800m / s@xmath100 , @xmath91hz , @xmath123s@xmath93 and @xmath94 m/s . for the a - state mot",
    "the forces act over a wider range of displacements and velocities , which is why it has a higher capture velocity . throughout , we have assumed that vibrational re - pump transitions do not share the same upper state as the main mot transition , in which case their influence on the mot forces is small .",
    "when a re - pump transition does share the same upper - state as the mot transition , we find that the force is reduced to about 70% of the values found here .",
    "we have identified a mechanism of magneto - optical trapping that arises when two laser components with opposite polarizations and different detunings address the same transition .",
    "the forces produced are strong even when the upper state has little or no zeeman shift , and also when there are dark states amongst the lower levels . in the b - state mot it is the large value of @xmath98 that contributes most to the trapping force , with the dual - frequency effects playing only a minor role .",
    "by contrast , the trapping force in the a - state mot comes almost entirely from these dual - frequency effects .",
    "these effects also play a large role in the srf mot that has recently been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "if we turn these effects off in our model of the srf mot ( by artificially increasing the hyperfine intervals ) the maximum acceleration is reduced by a factor of six , the turning point of the acceleration curve is a factor of two closer to the centre , and the trapping frequency is reduced by a factor of two .",
    "the dual - frequency effect can be utilized to produce stronger trapping forces using a carefully designed set of laser frequencies . for caf , adding a single extra frequency component increases the restoring force by 100% for the a - state mot and by 50% for the b - state mot . however , the extra frequency has the effect of reducing the range of velocities where the damping force is strong , and this reduces the mot capture velocity .",
    "the extra frequency component could be added to tighten the confinement once the mot has already been loaded .",

    "<S> magneto - optical trapping forces for molecules are far weaker than for alkali atoms because the photon scattering rate is reduced when there are multiple ground states , and because of optical pumping into dark states . </S>",
    "<S> the force is further reduced when the upper state has a much smaller zeeman splitting than the lower state . </S>",
    "<S> we use a rate model to estimate the strength of the trapping and damping forces in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) of caf molecules , using either the a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 transition or the b@xmath1 - x@xmath1 transition . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a new mechanism of magneto - optical trapping that arises when , in each beam of the mot , two laser components with opposite polarizations and different detunings address the same transition . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism produces a strong trapping force even when the upper state has little or no zeeman splitting . </S>",
    "<S> it is the main mechanism responsible for the trapping force when the a@xmath0 - x@xmath1 transition is used . </S>"
