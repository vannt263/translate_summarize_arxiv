    "a catalogue containing 1021 star cluster candidates for galactic latitudes @xmath11 and all longitudes was recently published by @xcite .",
    "their targets ( hereafter fsr objects ) were detected by means of an automated algorithm that basically identified regions with stellar overdensities , applied to the 2mass database .",
    "the overdensities were classified according to a quality flag , 0 and 1 representing the most probable star clusters , while the 5 and 6 flags may be related to field fluctuations .    by means of a combination of three parameters , the number of cluster stars corrected to a common magnitude limit , the core radius and the central star density , @xcite could discriminate known gcs from ocs .",
    "when applied to the catalogue , this criterion led them to classify 1012 targets as oc candidates and 9 as gc candidates that should be explored in followup studies . among the latter",
    "are fsr1603 and fsr1755 .",
    "several works have already explored the fsr catalogue with varying depths and different approaches , with results that reflect the importance of such catalogue .",
    "the recently discovered gcs fsr1735 ( @xcite ) and fsr1767 ( @xcite ) , and the probable gcs fsr584 ( @xcite ) and fsr190 ( @xcite ) , are clear examples of the fundamental rle played by the fsr catalogue to improve the statistics of very old star clusters . indeed , fsr1735 and fsr1767 are the most recent additions to the galactic gc population , a number that presently amounts to @xmath12 members ( e.g. @xcite ) .    besides the obvious importance of finding new star clusters of any age throughout the milky way",
    ", the identification of the iacs fsr31 , fsr89 and fsr1744 , projected towards the centre of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , has provided as well important information on cluster disruption processes and survival rates in those regions . in this context , derivation of astrophysical parameters of new star clusters can be used in studies related to the star formation and evolution processes , dynamics of n - body systems , cluster disruption time scales , the geometry of the galaxy , among others .",
    "central to the problem of identifying the nature of catalogue stellar overdensities is the availability of a field - star decontamination algorithm to disentangle physical cmd sequences from field fluctuations .",
    "low - noise stellar radial - density profiles ( rdps ) spanning a wide radial range are essential as well , especially for objects projected against dense stellar fields ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , based on such premises and working with the decontamination algorithm described in @xcite applied to 2mass photometry , @xcite found that the gc candidate fsr89 is rather a well - defined iac .",
    "most of the fsr catalogue remains to be further explored . as another step in the direction of classifying fsr candidates",
    " taking into account cmd and rdp properties  we show in the present work that the candidates fsr1603 and fsr1755 are not gcs . instead , fsr1603 is a massive iac projected @xmath13 from the centre of the galaxy , and fsr1755 is an embedded cluster @xmath14 from the centre .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ targets ] we present fundamental data and optical and near - ir images of fsr1603 and fsr1755 . in sect .",
    "[ photpar ] we present the 2mass photometry and discuss the methods employed in the cmd analyses , especially the field - star decontamination and the stellar radial density profiles . in sect .  [ disc ] we apply the tools to both candidates and discuss their nature . concluding remarks",
    "are given in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] provides original information on fsr1603 and fsr1755 , where we also include the core and tidal radii measured by @xcite in the 2mass  images by means of a @xcite profile fit .",
    "both candidates have been classified as probable star clusters by @xcite ; the quality flags are also given .",
    "the different quality flags of fsr1603 and fsr1755 can be accounted for by the significantly different numbers of prospective cluster members computed by @xcite , which we include in the last column of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "fsr1603 has the oc ruprecht101 as optical counterpart , for which the coordinates are the only data provided by the webda database .",
    "the relatively low contrast of fsr1603 with respect to the background can be seen in the @xmath15 dss b image ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left panel ) .",
    "nevertheless , a few bright stars appear to stand out around the image centre over a rather uniform stellar background .",
    "the field of fsr1755 , on the other hand , presents a complex structure that includes important contamination by bulge stars , strong absorption by dust lanes and @xmath16 emission , clearly seen in the @xmath15 xdss r image ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left panel ) .",
    "these features show up as well in the near ir , as can be seen in the 2mass  images ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in two different spatial scales .",

    ". col .  8 :  calculated using @xmath20kpc ( @xcite ) as the distance of the sun to the galactic centre .",
    "colour - magnitude filters are used to exclude stars with colours compatible with those of the foreground / background field .",
    "they are wide enough to accommodate cluster ms and evolved star colour distributions , allowing for the @xmath21 photometric uncertainties .",
    "colour - magnitude filter widths should also account for formation or dynamical evolution - related effects , such as enhanced fractions of binaries ( and other multiple systems ) towards the central parts of clusters , since such systems tend to widen the ms ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".    however , residual field stars with colours similar to those of the cluster are expected to remain inside the colour - magnitude filter region .",
    "they affect the intrinsic stellar radial distribution profile to an extent that depends on the relative densities of field and cluster stars .",
    "the contribution of the residual contamination to the observed rdp is statistically taken into account by means of the comparison field .",
    "star clusters usually have rdps that follow some well - defined analytical profile",
    ". the most often used are the single - mass , modified isothermal sphere of @xcite , the modified isothermal sphere of @xcite , and the power - law with a core of @xcite .",
    "each function is characterised by different parameters that are somehow related to cluster structure .",
    "however , considering that error bars in the present rdps are significant ( see below ) , and that our goal here is basically to determine the nature of the targets , we decided for the analytical profile @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the residual background density , @xmath24 is the central density of stars , and  is the core radius .",
    "this function is similar to that introduced by @xcite to describe the surface brightness profiles in the central parts of globular clusters .",
    "the stellar rdps are built with colour - magnitude filtered photometry ( sect .",
    "[ cmf ] ) .",
    "minimisation of the presence of non - cluster stars by the colour - magnitude filter results in rdps with a significantly higher contrast with the background ( e.g. @xcite ) . to avoid oversampling near the centre and undersampling at large radii",
    ", rdps are built by counting stars in rings of increasing width with distance to the centre .",
    "the number and width of the rings are adjusted to produce rdps with adequate spatial resolution and as small as possible @xmath21 poisson errors .",
    "the residual background level of each rdp corresponds to the average number of colour - magnitude filtered stars measured in the comparison field .",
    "the @xmath25 coordinate ( and respective uncertainty ) of each ring corresponds to the average position and standard deviation of the stars inside the ring .",
    "we also compute the density contrast parameter @xmath26 , that measures the intrinsic contrast of a cluster rdp ( in the central region ) with the background .",
    "in general terms , @xmath27 is a measure of the detectability of clusters by means of star counts .",
    "obviously , the presence of o stars in very young clusters may improve the detectability , even for low-@xmath27 cases . as a caveat we note that @xmath27 values measured in colour - magnitude filtered rdps",
    "do not necessarily correspond to the visual contrast produced by optical / ir images .",
    "the minimisation of field star contamination produces rdps with higher contrast than those resulting from the raw photometry ( e.g. @xcite ) .    as a measure of the cluster size",
    ", we also derive the limiting radius and uncertainty , which are estimated by comparing the rdp ( taking into account fluctuations ) with the background level",
    ". corresponds to the distance from the cluster centre where rdp and background become statistically indistinguishable . for practical purposes ,",
    "most of the cluster stars are contained within @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the limiting radius should not be mistaken for the tidal radius ; the latter is usually derived from king ( or other analytical functions ) fits to rdps , which depend on wide surrounding fields and as small as possible poisson errors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast ,  comes from a visual comparison of the rdp and background levels .",
    "the empirical determination of a cluster - limiting radius depends on the relative levels of rdp and background ( and respective fluctuations ) .",
    "thus , dynamical evolution may indirectly affect the measurement of the limiting radius .",
    "since mass segregation preferentially drives low - mass stars to the outer parts of clusters , the cluster / background contrast in these regions tends to lower as clusters age . as an observational consequence , smaller values of limiting radii should be measured , especially for clusters in dense fields .",
    "however , simulations of king - like ocs ( @xcite ) show that , provided not exceedingly high , background levels may produce limiting radii underestimated by about 1020% .",
    "the core radius , on the other hand , is almost insensitive to background levels ( @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs because  results from fitting the king - like profile to a distribution of rdp points , which minimises background effects .",
    "cmds of the central ( @xmath29 ) region of fsr1603 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top panels ) .",
    "this extraction contains the bulk of the cluster stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "features that stand out are a cluster - like population corresponding to a populous ms ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , a giant clump ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and a giant branch ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , together with a redder sequence ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "some of these features ( especially around the ms and the red component ) are present as well in the equal - area comparison field ( middle panels ) , extracted from a ring near @xmath37 , which suggests some contamination by disk and bulge stars .",
    "however , the central and comparison field extractions present significant differences in terms of cmd densities . besides , the giant clump and giant branch are not present in the comparison field .",
    "similar features are present in the @xmath38 cmds ( right panels ) .",
    "the qualitative discussion above strongly suggests that fsr1603 is an intermediate - age oc .",
    "the resulting field star decontaminated cmds of fsr1603 are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the comparison field was taken from the region @xmath39 .",
    "bulge and disk contamination have been properly taken into account , except for about 40 red stars that remain in the decontaminated cmds .",
    "considering that the original red component contains about 214 stars ( top panels ) , the statistical significance of the leftovers represent @xmath40 , significantly lower than that of stellar sequence identified with fsr1603 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such low values of  are typical of field fluctuations detected as overdensities by @xcite .",
    "what emerges from the @xmath41 decontaminated cmds are conspicuous sequences , especially the giant clump and the ms , typical of a relatively populous gyr - class oc .",
    "indeed , the decontaminated cmd morphology of fsr1603 is well represented by the 1gyr isochrone , with a distance modulus @xmath42 , and a reddening @xmath43 , which corresponds to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "such values imply a distance from the sun @xmath46kpc and a galactocentric distance @xmath47kpc . at this distance ,",
    "the scale is @xmath48pc .",
    "the isochrone fit to fsr1603 is shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the stellar rdp of fsr1603 . besides the rdp resulting from the colour - magnitude filter ,",
    "we also show , for illustrative purposes , that produced with the observed ( raw ) photometry . in both cases",
    ", the central region presents a significant density contrast with respect to the background , especially the colour - magnitude filter rdp , with @xmath49 .",
    "the adopted king - like function describes well the latter rdp throughout the full radii range , within uncertainties .",
    "we derive a core radius @xmath50 and a limiting radius @xmath51 .",
    "the central density of stars @xmath52 and the core radius ( ) are derived from the rdp fit , while the background level @xmath53 is measured in the respective comparison field .",
    "the best - fit solution is superimposed on the colour - magnitude filtered rdp ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . because of the 2mass photometric limit , which for fsr1603 corresponds to a cutoff for stars brighter than @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , @xmath24 should be taken as a lower limit to the actual central number - density . within the uncertainty",
    ", the present value of  agrees with that given by @xcite",
    ".    the relatively populous nature of the ms of fsr1603 can be used to estimate the mass stored in stars . considering the field - star decontaminated photometry , the number of observed ms and evolved stars for @xmath55 amount to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . using the mass - luminosity relation derived from the 1gyr padova isochrone set with the parameters presented above ,",
    "the observed ms mass is @xmath58 . for the evolved stars we multiply @xmath59 by the stellar mass at the to ( @xmath60 ) , which yields the estimate @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the total mass stored in the observed stars of fsr1603 amounts to @xmath62 .",
    "we also build the mass function ( mf ) @xmath63 , for the ms stars following the methods discussed in @xcite . to maximise the statistical significance of field - star counts we take as the comparison field the region at @xmath64 , that lies @xmath65 beyond the limiting radius .",
    "first we apply the colour - magnitude filter ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) to the stars located inside the limiting radius , which eliminates most of the field stars , leaving a residual contamination .",
    "we deal with this statistically by building the luminosity functions ( lfs ) for the cluster and comparison field separately . ,  and lfs are built by counting stars in magnitude bins from the respective faint magnitude limit to the to . to avoid undersampling near the turn - off and oversampling at the faint limit , magnitude bins are wider in the upper ms than in the lower ms .",
    "correction is made for the different solid angles of the comparison field and cluster region .",
    "the intrinsic cluster lf is obtained by subtracting the offset - field lf .",
    "finally , the intrinsic lf is transformed into mf using the mass - luminosity relation obtained from the 1gyr padova isochrone and the observed distance modulus @xmath66 .",
    "these procedures are applied independently to the three 2mass bands .",
    "the final mf is produced by combining the ,  and  mfs .",
    "further details on mf construction are given in @xcite .",
    "the resulting mf , covering the mass range @xmath67 , is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we also include the fit with the function @xmath68 . within the uncertainty ,",
    "the slope @xmath69 is similar to the @xmath70 of the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite .",
    "finally , with the above mf we can estimate the total stellar mass in fsr1603 .",
    "for masses below the observed lower limit of 1.27 , we extrapolate the observed mf down to the h - burning mass limit ( @xmath71 ) using the universal imf of @xcite .",
    "the latter imf assumes the slopes @xmath72 for the range @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 . with such considerations , the total ( extrapolated ms @xmath76 evolved )",
    "mass amounts to @xmath77 , which implies the average mass density @xmath78 and the projected density @xmath79 .    as a caveat",
    "we note that the total mass estimates should be taken as upper limits , since because of dynamical evolution , significant fractions of the low - mass content may have been lost to the field ( e.g. @xcite ) .      the images of fsr1755 ( figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) clearly indicate that this object is a complicated case .",
    "indeed , the differential absorption due to the dust clouds produces conspicuous variations in the stellar number - density , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    according to simbad ,",
    "the bright star at @xmath80 south of the central coordinates of fsr1755 is the o star @xmath81 .",
    "fsr1755 appears to be spatially associated with the hii region sh2 - 3 ( @xcite ) , located at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , also known as gum58 ( @xcite ) and rcw120 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite provides the radial velocity @xmath84 , and the kinematic distance @xmath85kpc for sh2 - 3 . according to the spatial distribution of the spiral arms ( @xcite )",
    ", sh2 - 3 appears to be related to the sagittarius - carina arm .",
    "sh2 - 3 is an optical hii region of dimensions @xmath86 , excited by the o8v star @xmath81 ( lss3959 ) , at @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it was identified spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide @xmath89kpc as the photometric distance to this star .",
    "@xmath81 has the apparent magnitudes @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xcite ) , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ( 2mass ) .",
    "based on the optical photometry of @xmath81 , @xcite compute @xmath95 and estimate the distance to this star as @xmath96kpc , which agrees with their kinematic distance of @xmath97kpc . with the 2mass photometry of @xmath81 and the absolute  and  magnitudes of an o8v synthetic star ( @xcite ) we compute @xmath97kpc , which agrees with the previous values .",
    "we also derive @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( top panels ) we show the @xmath102 cmd extracted from the @xmath103 central region of fsr1755 . an almost vertical , blue ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) sequence",
    " typical of very young populations  appears to merge into a dominant concentration of red stars .",
    "the strong differential reddening in the field of fsr1755 hinders the quantitative use of the decontamination algorithm .",
    "however , it can be applied as a qualitative probe on cmd features , for different choices of the comparison field .",
    "two cases are examined , one taking field stars from the region @xmath106 , that basically corresponds to the deep rdp depression ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , and the other from an external region @xmath107 away from the centre .",
    "for visual purposes only , we characterise the field contamination on the @xmath103 central cmds , resulting from both choices of comparison field , by means of the equal - area extractions @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively . they are shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for statistical representativity of the field stars",
    ", the decontamination algorithm uses the full radial scale of the adopted comparison fields , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the stellar distributions are similar in terms of colour and magnitudes , but they differ significantly in density .",
    "consequently , the resulting decontaminated cmds also present differences , especially in the remaining field - star distribution .",
    "however , the blue sequence consistently remains in both cmds .",
    "assuming that fsr1755 is associated with sh2 - 3 , we apply to the decontaminated cmds the 3myr padova isochrone as representative of the young age , together with the pre - ms ( pms ) tracks of @xcite with the ages 1myr and 5myr , set for @xmath97kpc and @xmath110 . what results in both cases",
    "is consistent with a sparse embedded cluster .",
    "thus , most of what remains in the cmds as the red component results from the strong differential reddening in the rich field .",
    "however , because of the strong differential absorption , we can not exclude the possibility that some fraction of the red component is composed of very reddened pms stars .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present the rdps of fsr1755 . the deep rdp depression , which is due to dust absorption , associated with the large number of stars related to the red component , creates the impression of a high central stellar concentration and large core radius . taken together ,",
    "these features match the gc criterion established by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the rdp dip ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) coincides with the tidal radius computed by @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "most of the above features are absent in the colour - magnitude filtered rdp , which has a low - level central concentration of stars typical of a poorly - populated star cluster , and a small bump at @xmath111 that coincides with the radial distance of @xmath81 .    from the above we",
    "conclude that the potentially populous cluster fsr1755 is in fact an artifact produced by the highly spatially variable star - count density and absorption across the field .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility of a sparse young cluster embedded in the hii region sh2 - 3 .",
    "in this paper we investigated the nature of the gc candidates fsr1603 and fsr1755 , taken from the @xcite catalogue , by means of decontaminated  and  2mass cmds and stellar rdps .",
    "both objects were originally classified as gc candidates by @xcite based essentially on the number of cluster stars , the core radius and the central star density .",
    "basically , what results from the present work is that neither object is in fact a globular cluster : fsr1603 is a populous intermediate - age open cluster and fsr1755 may consist of a sparse young cluster embedded in a complex h ii region .",
    "fsr1603 corresponds to the oc ruprecht101 , for which cluster parameters were derived for the first time .",
    "it is a massive iac , with @xmath112gyr , located at @xmath113kpc from the sun and galactocentric distance @xmath114kpc , reddening @xmath44 , core and limiting radii @xmath115pc and @xmath116pc , respectively .",
    "the mass stored in the observed stars is @xmath117 ; extrapolation to the low - ms stars ( @xmath118 ) increases the mass to @xmath119 .",
    "ru101 was probably misclassified as a gc candidate because it is a populous oc .",
    "fsr1755 is related to the optical hii region sh2 - 3 , located at @xmath120kpc .",
    "the object is surrounded both by @xmath16 emission and dust absorption even in the   band . a nearly vertical , blue cmd sequence , that includes the o8v star @xmath81 , appears to define fsr1755 as a sparse embedded cluster .",
    "because of the strong differential reddening in the surroundings , a large number of red stars show up in the cmds , which probably produced the stellar enhancement that was taken as gc candidate by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the gc identification of fsr1755 is a dust - absorption artifact in a very rich stellar field .",
    "systematic surveys such as that of @xcite are important to detect new star cluster candidates throughout the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , works like the present one , that fine tune the analysis by means of field - star decontaminated cmds and stellar radial profiles , turn out to be fundamental to probe the nature of such candidates , especially those projected against dense stellar fields .",
