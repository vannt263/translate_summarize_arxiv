    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation reveal the conditions of the universe when it was @xmath7 years old with remarkable precision .",
    "the three most fundamental properties of the cmb are its frequency spectrum and the angular power spectra of the temperature and polarization fluctuations . the frequency spectrum was well determined by the cobe firas instrument ( mather et  al .",
    "1994 ; fixsen et  al .",
    "the initial detection of temperature anisotropy was made on large angular scales by the cobe dmr instrument ( smoot et  al .",
    "1992 ) and recently there has been considerable progress in measuring the anisotropy on finer angular scales ( miller et  al . 1999 ; halverson et  al . 2002",
    "; netterfield et  al . 2002 ; lee et  al .",
    "there have been many efforts to measure the polarization ( see below ) but so far , detection of this property of the cmb has remained beyond the reach of the most sensitive observations .    in the past several years , a standard cosmological model has emerged ( see , e.g. , hu & dodelson 2002 ) . in this model ,",
    "the structure of the cmb angular power spectrum at degree angular scales is assumed to arise from acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid sourced by primordial scalar adiabatic fluctuations . at decoupling ,",
    "the modes at maximal amplitude lead to excess power in the observed cmb angular power spectrum resulting in a harmonic series of peaks and troughs . within this theoretical framework , and given knowledge of the temperature angular power spectrum , a prediction can be made for the level of the cmb polarization with essentially no free parameters ( kaiser 1983 ; bond & efstathiou 1984 ; polnarev 1985 ; kamionkowski , kosowsky , & stebbins 1997 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1997 ; hu & white 1997 ; kosowsky 1999 ) .",
    "a determination of the cmb polarization would therefore provide a critical test of the underlying theoretical framework ( hu , spergel , & white 1997 ; kinney 2001 ; bucher , moodley , & turok 2001 ) and therefore of the validity of cosmological parameters derived from cmb measurements .",
    "polarization measurements also offer the potential to triple the number of observed cmb quantities and to enhance our ability to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "cmb polarization arises from thompson scattering by electrons of a radiation field with a local quadrupole moment ( rees 1968 ) . in the primordial plasma , the local quadrupole moment",
    "is suppressed until the photon mean free path grows during decoupling . at this time ,",
    "the largest contribution to the local quadrupole is due to doppler shifts induced by the velocity field of the plasma ( zaldarriaga & harari 1995 ) . in this way ,",
    "cmb polarization directly probes the dynamics at the epoch of decoupling . for a fourier mode of the acoustic oscillations , the electron velocities are perpendicular to the wavefronts , leading to either a parallel or perpendicular alignment of the resulting polarization .",
    "these polarization modes are referred to as the scalar @xmath3-modes in analogy with electric fields ; they have no curl component .",
    "since the level of the polarization depends on velocity , one expects that the peaks in the scalar @xmath3-mode power spectrum correspond to density modes that are at their highest velocities at decoupling and are therefore at minimum amplitude .",
    "the location of the harmonic peaks in the scalar @xmath3-mode power spectrum are therefore expected to be out of phase with the peaks in the temperature spectrum ( kamionkowski et  al .",
    "1997 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1997 ; hu & white 1997 ) .    primordial gravity waves will lead to polarization in the cmb ( polnarev 1985 ; crittenden , davis , & steinhardt 1993 ) with an @xmath3-mode pattern as for the scalar density perturbations , but will also lead to a curl component , referred to as @xmath5-mode polarization ( kamionkowski et  al . 1997 ; seljak & zaldarriaga 1997 ) . the @xmath5-mode component is due to the intrinsic polarization of the gravity waves . in inflationary models ,",
    "the level of the gravity wave induced @xmath5-mode polarization power is set by the energy scale of inflation to the fourth power .",
    "while the detection of @xmath5-mode polarization would provide a critical test of inflation , the signal is likely to be very weak and may have an amplitude that is effectively unobservable ( lyth 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , distortions to the scalar @xmath3-mode polarization by the gravitational lensing of the intervening large scale structure in the universe will lead to a contaminating b - mode polarization signal which will severely complicate the extraction of the gravity - wave induced signal ( zaldarriaga & seljak 1998 ; hu & okamoto 2002 ; knox & song 2002 ) .",
    "the possibility , however , of directly probing the universe at energy scales of @xmath8 gev by measuring the gravity - wave induced polarization ( see , e.g. , kamionkowski & kosowsky 1999 ) is a compelling goal for cmb polarization observations .    prior to the results presented in this paper , only upper limits have been placed on the level of cmb polarization .",
    "this is due to the low level of the expected signal , demanding sensitive instruments and careful attention to sources of systematic uncertainty ( see staggs , gunderson , & church 1999 , for a review of cmb polarization measurements ) .",
    "the first limit to the degree of polarization of the cmb was set by & wilson ( 1965 ) who stated that the new radiation that they had discovered was isotropic and unpolarized within the limits of their observations . over the following 20 years , dedicated polarimeters",
    "have been used to set much more stringent upper limits on angular scales of order several degrees and larger ( caderni et  al .",
    "1978 ; nanos 1979 ; lubin & smoot 1979 , 1981 ; lubin , melese , & smoot 1983 ; sironi et  al . 1997 ) .",
    "the current best upper limits for the @xmath3-mode and @xmath5-mode polarizations on large angular scales are 10@xmath9k at 95% confidence for the multipole range @xmath10 , set by the polar experiment ( keating et  al .",
    ".    on angular scales of order one degree , ( 1993 ) used the saskatoon experiment to set the first upper limit to the cmb polarization ( @xmath11k at 95% confidence for @xmath12 ) ; this limit is also noteworthy in that it was the first limit that was lower than the level of the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "the current best limit on similar angular scales was set by the pique experiment ( hedman et  al .",
    "2002 ) , who reported a 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath13k to the @xmath3-mode signal , assuming no b - mode polarization .",
    "( 2002 ) presented a preliminary analysis of cbi data that indicated an upper limit similar to the pique result , but on somewhat smaller scales .    on much finer angular scales of order an arcminute",
    ", polarization measurements have also been pursued and upper limits set ( e.g. , partridge et  al . 1997 ; subrahmanyan et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , at these angular scales , corresponding to multipoles @xmath14 , the level of the primary cmb anisotropy is strongly damped and secondary effects due to the interactions with large scale structure in the universe are expected to dominate ( hu & dodelson 2002 ) .    in this paper , we present the results of cmb polarization measurements made with the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) located at the nsf amundsen - scott south pole research station during the 2001 and 2002 austral winter seasons .",
    "dasi was successfully used to measure the temperature anisotropy from @xmath15 during the 2000 season .",
    "details of the instrument , the measured power spectrum and the resulting cosmological constraints were presented in a series of three papers  ( leitch et  al .",
    "2002b ; halverson et  al .",
    "2002 ; pryke et  al .",
    "2002 , hereafter papers , i , ii and iii , respectively ) . prior to the start of the 2001 season , dasi was modified to allow polarization measurements in all four stokes parameters over the same @xmath16 range as the previous measurements .",
    "the modifications to the instrument , observational strategy , data calibration and data reduction are discussed in detail in leitch et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) ( hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : instrument ] we briefly summarize the modifications to the instrument , the observing strategy and the data calibration from paper iv and in  [ sec : observations ] the cmb observations and data reduction are discussed .",
    "the noise model and detection of signal in our data are discussed in  [ sec : noiseandsignal ] .",
    "the analysis method is presented in  [ sec : lhformalism ] and the results from the likelihood analysis which models and parameterizes the signal in terms of cmb polarization and temperature angular power spectra are given in ",
    "[ sec : lhresults ] . in ",
    "[ sec : systematics ] we discuss systematic uncertainties including instrumental effects and the possibility of foreground contamination .",
    "conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "dasi is a compact interferometric array optimized for the measurement of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy . a detailed discussion of the dasi instrument is given in paper i and the modifications for polarimetric observations are given in paper iv .",
    "here we briefly summarize the aspects of the instrument particularly relevant for polarization measurements .",
    "because they directly sample fourier components of the sky , interferometers are uniquely suited to measurements of the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "in addition , an interferometer gathers instantaneous two dimensional information while inherently rejecting large - scale gradients in atmospheric emission . for observations of cmb polarization ,",
    "interferometers offer several additional advantages .",
    "they can be constructed with the required small and stable instrumental polarization .",
    "furthermore , linear combinations of the data can be used to construct quantities with essentially pure @xmath3- and @xmath5-mode polarization response patterns on a variety of scales .",
    "this property of the data greatly facilitates the analysis and interpretation of the observed polarization in the context of cosmological models .",
    "dasi consists of 13 horn antennas mounted on a rigid faceplate in a three - fold symmetric pattern .",
    "following each antenna is a cooled , low - noise hemt amplifier optimized for the 26  36  ghz dasi band .",
    "the signals from the receivers are combined in a wideband analog correlator that computes the complex correlation , or _",
    "visibilities _ , between pairs of receivers in ten 1-ghz bands .",
    "the locations of the horns in the faceplate are optimized to provide uniform sampling over the multipole range @xmath17140  900 .",
    "the dasi mount is designed to track in elevation and azimuth with the additional ability to rotate the entire horn array about the faceplate axis .",
    "the flexibility of this mount allows us to tailor the fourier @xmath18 plane coverage of a given observation as well as perform sensitive tests for instrumental offsets and other possible systematic errors .",
    "as was detailed in paper i and & halverson ( 2000 ) , the sky above the south pole is extremely dry and stable , resulting in atmospheric contamination far below dasi s instrumental noise .",
    "in addition to the excellent observing conditions at the pole , it is possible to track a single field continuously at constant elevation angle .",
    "these two characteristics of the pole enable the deep integrations needed to detect the cmb polarization signal .",
    "in these sensitive observations , sources of foreground emission are potentially a serious concern .",
    "fortunately , the sky above the pole includes regions with low diffuse foreground emission .      during the 20002001 austral summer ,",
    "dasi s thirteen receivers were retrofit with broadband achromatic circular polarizers .",
    "these polarizers employ a multi - element design capable of rejecting the unwanted polarization state to better than @xmath19 across dasi s frequency band ( see paper iv , also  [ sec : onaxisleak ] ) .",
    "an interferometer measures the correlations between the signals from pairs of receivers ; as indicated by equation  [ eq : vis ] in  [ sec : theory ] , recovery of the full complement of stokes parameters requires the correlation of all four pairwise combinations of left and right circular polarization states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , which we refer to as _ stokes states_. the co - polar states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , are sensitive to the total intensity , while the cross - polar states ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) measure linear combinations of the stokes parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "each of dasi s analog correlators can accommodate only a single stokes state , so measurement of the four combinations is achieved via time - multiplexing .",
    "the polarizers for each receiver are switched on a 1-hour walsh cycle , with the result that over the full period of the cycle , every pair of receivers spends an equal amount of time in all four stokes states .      in paper iv , we detail the calibration of the polarized visibilities for an interferometer . in order to produce the calibrated visibilities as defined in equation  [ eq : vis ] below ,",
    "a complex gain factor @xmath26 which depends on the stokes state @xmath27 must be applied to each raw visibility . although the cross - polar gain factors could easily be determined with observations of a bright polarized source , no suitable sources are known , and we therefore derive the full calibration through observations of an unpolarized source .",
    "the gains for a given pair of receivers @xmath28 ( a baseline ) can be decomposed into antenna - based terms ( for example , @xmath29 ) , allowing us to construct the cross - polar gains from @xmath30 and @xmath31 derived from the co - polar visibilities .",
    "dasi s calibration is based on daily observations of the bright hii region rcw38 , described at length in paper i , from which we can determine baseline gains for all stokes states to better than 2% .",
    "the procedure for deriving the baseline gains from antenna - based terms leaves the cross - polar visibilities multiplied by an undetermined overall phase offset ( independent of baseline ) .",
    "this phase offset effectively mixes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and must be measured to obtain a clean separation of cmb power into @xmath3- and @xmath5-modes .",
    "calibration of the phase offset requires a source whose polarization angle is known , and we create one by observing rcw38 through polarizing wire grids attached to dasi s thirteen receivers . from the wire - grid observations , we can derive the phase offset in each frequency band with an uncertainty of @xmath32 .",
    "as an independent check of this phase offset calibration , the moon was observed at several epochs during 20012002 .",
    "although the expected amplitude of the polarized signal from the moon is not well known at these frequencies , the polarization pattern is expected to be radial to high accuracy , and this can be used to determine the cross - polar phase offset independently of the wire grid observations . as shown in paper iv ,",
    "these two determinations of the phase offset are in excellent agreement .        for idealized polarizers ,",
    "the cross - polar visibilities are strictly proportional to linear combinations of the stokes parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "for realistic polarizers , however , imperfect rejection of the unwanted polarization state leads to additional terms in the cross - polar visibilities proportional to the total intensity @xmath33 .",
    "these _ leakage _ terms are the sum of the complex leakage of the two antennas which form each baseline . prior to installation on the telescope , the polarizers were tuned to minimize these leakages .    at several",
    "epochs during 20012002 , the antenna - based leakages were determined with a fractional error of @xmath34 from deep observations of the calibrator source rcw38 .",
    "as is shown in paper iv , antenna - based leakages are @xmath35 ( of @xmath33 ) at all frequency bands but the highest , where they approach @xmath36 ; this performance is close to the theoretical minimum for this polarizer design .",
    "comparison of the measurements from three epochs separated by many months indicates that the leakages are stable with time .    for observations of the cmb",
    ", the presence of leakage has the effect of mixing power from temperature into polarization in the uncorrected visibilities . given the low level of dasi s leakages , this is expected to be a minor effect at most ( see  [ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , in the analysis presented in this paper , the cross - polar data have in all cases been corrected to remove this effect using the leakages determined from rcw38 .",
    "although the polarizers were optimized for low on - axis leakage response , the feeds themselves will induce an instrumental polarization which varies across the primary beam . offset measurements of rcw38 and the moon",
    "indicate that the off - axis instrumental polarization pattern is radial , rising from zero at the beam center to a maximum of @xmath37 near @xmath38 , and then tapering to zero ( see also paper iv ) .    with the on - axis polarizer leakage subtracted to @xmath39 ( see above ) , this residual leakage , while still quite small compared to the expected level of polarized cmb signal ( again , see  [ sec : systematics ] ) ,",
    "is the dominant instrumental contribution .",
    "although the visibilities can not be individually corrected to remove this effect ( as for the on - axis leakage ) , it may be incorporated in the analysis of the cmb data . using fits to the offset data ( see paper iv for details )",
    ", we account for this effect by modeling the contribution of the off - axis leakage to the signal covariance matrix in the likelihood analysis described in ",
    "[ sec : lhformalism ] .",
    "for the observations presented here , two fields separated by one hour of right ascension , at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , were tracked continuously .",
    "the telescope alternated between the fields every hour , tracking them over precisely the same azimuth range so that any terrestrial signal can be removed by differencing .",
    "each 24-hour period comprised 20 hours of cmb observations and @xmath43 hours of bracketing calibrator observations , with the remaining time spent on skydips and miscellaneous calibration tasks .",
    "the fields were selected from the 32 fields previously observed by dasi for the absence of any detectable point sources ( see paper i ) .",
    "the locations of the 32 fields were originally selected to lie at high elevation angle and to coincide with low emission in the iras 100 micron and 408  mhz maps of the sky ( haslam et  al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "the data presented in this paper were acquired from 2001 april 10 to 2001 october 27 , and again from 2002 february 14 to 2002 july 11 .",
    "in all , we obtained 162 days of data in 2001 , and 109 in 2002 , for a total of 271 days before the cuts described in the next section .",
    "observations are excluded from the analysis , or _ cut _ , if they are considered suspect due to hardware problems , inadequate calibration , contamination from moon or sun signal , poor weather , or similar effects . in ",
    "[ sec : noiseandsignal ] , we describe consistency statistics that are much more sensitive to these effects than are the actual results of our likelihood analysis , allowing us to be certain that the final results are unaffected by contamination . here",
    "we briefly summarize the principal categories of data cuts ; each cut is described in detail in paper iv .    in the first category of cuts , we reject visibilities for which monitoring data from the telescope indicate obvious hardware malfunction , or simply non - ideal conditions .",
    "these include cryogenics failure , loss of tuning for a receiver , large offsets between real / imaginary multipliers in the correlators , and mechanical glitches in the polarizer stepper motors .",
    "all data are rejected for a correlator when it shows evidence for large offsets , or excessive noise .",
    "an additional cut , and the only one based on the individual data values , is a @xmath44 outlier cut to reject rare ( @xmath45 of the data ) hardware glitches . collectively these cuts reject @xmath46 of the data .    in the next category ,",
    "data are cut on the phase and amplitude stability of the calibrator observations . naturally , we reject data for which bracketing calibrator observations have been lost due to previous cuts .",
    "these cuts reject @xmath47 of the data .",
    "cuts are also based on the elevation of the sun and moon .",
    "co - polar data are cut whenever the sun was above the horizon , and cross - polar data whenever the solar elevation exceeded @xmath48 .",
    "these cuts reject 8% of the data .",
    "an additional cut , which is demonstrably sensitive to poor weather , is based on the significance of data correlations as discussed in  [ sec : noisemodel ] .",
    "an entire day is cut if the maximum correlation exceeds @xmath49 .",
    "a total of 22 days are cut by this test in addition to those rejected by the solar and lunar cuts .",
    "data reduction consists of a series of steps to calibrate and reduce the dataset to a manageable size for the likelihood analysis . phase and",
    "amplitude calibrations are applied to the data based on bracketing observations of our primary celestial calibrator , rcw38 .",
    "the raw 8.4-s integrations are combined over each 1-hr observation for each of 6240 visibilities ( 78 complex baselines @xmath50 10 frequency bands @xmath50 4 stokes states ) .",
    "leakage corrections are applied to the data , and sequential observations of the two fields in the same @xmath51 azimuth range are differenced to remove any common ground signal . except in the case of the sum and difference data used for the @xmath52 consistency tests in ",
    "[ sec : chi2tests ] , observations from different faceplate rotation angles , epochs , and azimuth ranges are combined , as well as the two co - polar stokes states , @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting dataset has @xmath53 elements ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we call this the uncompressed dataset , and it contains all of the information in our observations of the differenced fields for stokes parameters @xmath33 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we begin our analysis by arranging the data into a vector , considered to be the sum of actual sky signal and instrumental noise : @xmath56 the noise vector @xmath57 is hypothesized to be gaussian and random , with zero mean , so that the noise model is completely specified by a known covariance matrix @xmath58 .",
    "any significant excess variance observed in the data vector @xmath59 will be interpreted as signal . in the likelihood analysis of the next section ,",
    "we characterize the total covariance of the dataset @xmath60 in terms of parameters @xmath61 that specify the covariance @xmath62 of this sky signal .",
    "this is the conventional approach to cmb data analysis , and it is clear that for it to succeed , the assumptions about the noise model and the accuracy of the noise covariance matrix must be thoroughly tested .",
    "this is especially true for our dataset , in which we have achieved unprecedented levels of sensitivity in an attempt to measure the very small signal covariances expected from the polarization of the cmb .",
    "the dasi instrument and observing strategy are designed to remove systematic errors through multiple levels of differencing .",
    "slow and fast phase switching as well as field differencing are used to minimize potentially variable systematic offsets that could otherwise contribute a non - thermal component to the noise .",
    "the observing strategy also includes walsh sequencing of the stokes states , observations over multiple azimuth ranges and faceplate rotation angles , and repeated observations of the same visibilities on the sky throughout the observing run to allow checks for systematic offsets and verification that the sky signal is repeatable .",
    "we hypothesize that after the cuts described in the previous section , the noise in the remaining data are gaussian and white , with no noise correlations between different baselines , frequency bands , real / imaginary pairs , or stokes states .",
    "we have carefully tested the noise properties of the data to validate the use of this model .",
    "noise variance in the combined data vector is estimated by calculating the variance in the 8.4-s integrations over the period of 1  hr , before field differencing . to test that this noise estimate is accurate",
    ", we compare three different short timescale noise estimates : calculated from the 8.4-s integrations over the 1-hr observations before and after field differencing and from sequential pairs of 8.4-s integrations .",
    "we find that all three agree within 0.06% for co - polar data and",
    "0.03% for cross - polar data , averaged over all visibilities after data cuts .",
    "we also compare the noise estimates based on the short timescale noise to the variance of the 1-hr binned visibilities over the entire dataset ( up to 2700 1-hr observations , over a period spanning 457 days ) .",
    "the ratio of long timescale to short timescale noise variance , averaged over all combined visibilities after data cuts , is @xmath63 for the co - polar data and @xmath64 for the cross - polar data , remarkably close to unity . together with the results of the @xmath55 consistency tests described in  [ sec : chi2tests ] , these results demonstrate that the noise is white and integrates down from timescales of a few seconds to thousands of hours .",
    "we find that scaling the diagonal noise by 1% makes a negligible difference in the reported likelihood results ( see  [ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "to test for potential off - diagonal correlations in the noise , we calculate a @xmath65 correlation coefficient matrix from the 8.4-s integrations for each day of observations .",
    "to increase our sensitivity to correlated noise , we use only data obtained simultaneously for a given pair of data vector elements . due to the variable number of 8.4-s integrations @xmath66 used to calculate each off - diagonal element",
    ", we assess the significance of the correlation coefficient in units of @xmath67 .",
    "our weather cut statistic is the daily maximum off - diagonal correlation coefficient significance ( see  [ sec : cuts ] ) .",
    "we use the mean data correlation coefficient matrix over all days , after weather cuts , to test for significant correlations over the entire dataset .",
    "we find that 1864 ( 0.016% ) of the off - diagonal elements exceed a significance of @xmath68 , when about one such event is expected for uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "the outliers are dominated by correlations between real / imaginary pairs of the same baseline , frequency band , and stokes state , and between different frequency bands of the same baseline and stokes state . for the real / imaginary pairs ,",
    "the maximum correlation coefficient amplitude is 0.14 , with an estimated mean amplitude of 0.02 ; for interband correlations the maximum amplitude and estimated mean are 0.04 and 0.003 , respectively .",
    "we have tested the inclusion of these correlations in the likelihood analysis and find that they have a negligible impact on the results , see  [ sec : systematics ] .      as a simple and sensitive test of data consistency",
    ", we construct a @xmath52 statistic from various splits and subsets of the visibility data . splitting the data into two sets of observations that should measure the same sky signal , we form the statistic for both the sum and difference data vectors , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the sum or difference data vector , and @xmath71 is the corresponding noise covariance matrix .",
    "we use the difference data vector , with the common sky signal component subtracted , to test for systematic offsets and mis - estimates of the noise .",
    "the sum data vector is used to test for the presence of a sky signal in a straightforward way that is independent of the analysis method used for parameter extraction .      1 .",

    "these splits were done on the combined 2001/2002 dataset and ( except for the first split type ) on 2001 and 2002 datasets separately , to test for persistent trends or obvious differences between the years .",
    "the faceplate position split is particularly powerful , since the six - fold symmetry of the @xmath18 plane coverage allows us to measure a sky signal for a given baseline with a different pair of receivers , different backend hardware , and at a different position on the faceplate with respect to the ground shields , and is therefore sensitive to calibration and other offsets that may depend on these factors .",
    "the co - polar split tests the amplitude and phase calibration between polarizer states , and tests for the presence of circularly polarized light .    for each of these splits , different subsets can be examined : co - polar data only , cross - polar data only ( for all except the stokes state split ) , various @xmath16-ranges ( as determined by baseline length in units of wavelength ) , and subsets formed from any of these which isolate modes with the highest expected signal to noise ( s / n ) . these high s / n ( sub)subsets must assume some theoretical signal template in defining the s / n eigenmode basis ( bond , jaffe , & knox 1998 ) in which to arrange the data elements of the original subset , and for this we use the concordance model defined in  [ sec : lpar ] , although we find the results are not strongly dependent on choice of model .",
    "note that the definitions of which modes are included in the high s / n subsets are made in terms of average theoretical signal , without any reference to the actual data . in table  [ tab : chi2 ] , we present the difference and sum @xmath52 values , for a representative selection of splits and subsets . in each case",
