    "in the next few years , the new generation of cmb experiments ( map and planck ) will provide all - sky maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with high resolutions and sensitivities .",
    "theoretical investigations of different kinds of foregrounds , instrumental noise properties , scan strategies and related topics for the future planck mission are now in progress .",
    "the planck lfi and hfi instruments will be able to measure the cmb anisotropy and polarization using 10 frequency channels that cover the frequency range 30 - 857 ghz ( mandolesi et al.,1998 ; maino et al.,1999 ) .",
    "the maps provided by planck will contain contributions from various physical components , including the primary and secondary cmb signals and foregrounds such as free - free and synchrotron emission , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , galactic dust and extragalactic point sources .",
    "one of the important goals of this experiment , apart from the separation of the cmb from the remaining parts of the signal , is the creation of a point source catalogue .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how one may optimize the strategy for producing the point source catalogue by using the multi - frequency properties of the radio / submillimetre sky observations .",
    "the effect of point sources on satellite observations has been widely discussed in the literature ( see the review by vielva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and references therein ) .",
    "many authors have developed various linear and non - linear methods for point source extraction .",
    "hobson et al . ( 1999 ) suggested the combination of the maximum- entropy method ( mem ) with mexican hat wavelet filtering in order to separate all the physical components of the microwave ski including extragalactic point sources and using different frequency channels .",
    "tegmark and de oliveira - costa ( 1998 ; hereafter to-98 ) described the linear filtering of point sources in the form of a band - pass filter in order to render point sources on each frequency map more visible relative to the background of other physical components .",
    "cayon ( 2000 ) , sanz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vielva et al .",
    "( 2000 ) applied the mexican hat wavelet method to denoising the cmb maps and for production of the planck point source catalogue .",
    "naselsky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , chiang et al . ( 2001 ) proposed the approach of amplitude - phase analysis and applied it to simulated maps of the cmb with foregrounds , point sources and pixel noise included for the accurate determination of the locations of bright point sources and separation of these sources from the rest of the signal by an iteration technique .",
    "all of the methods mentioned above can complement each other in the framework of the future highly sensitive cmb experiments because of the different sensitivities of each method to different properties of the signal .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the combination of maps with different frequencies in order to maximize the signal ( @xmath0- point sources ) to noise ( @xmath1- rest of the signal ) ratio .",
    "we show that co - adding of harmonics from different maps with specific weights leads to an increase in the accuracy of the point source subtraction .",
    "the aim of our paper is to produce the best possible combination of all frequency channels in order to construct a map in which the presence of point sources of some particular population is most visible .",
    "this procedure allows us to obtain a more complete and accurate catalogue of point sources than can be obtained by independently investigating each frequency channel ( to-98 ) .",
    "the layout of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the definition of the best map combination , derive the analytical solution for the maximum possible signal - to - noise ratio and make some numerical predictions for the planck experiment .",
    "we also present a possible special combinations of the multifrequency maps .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in section 3 .",
    "in this section , we derive the optimal way for using the different frequency channels to produce the best possible map for detection and subsequent subtraction of extra - galactic point sources . the idea behind our approach is quite simple and transparent .",
    "we define the best map as the combination of different frequency maps which maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio . in our case",
    ", the signal is the signal from point sources .",
    "the noise consists of other physical components including pixel noise , cmb , dust , synchrotron and free - free emission .",
    "all of these components limit our capability to detect point sources .    _",
    "optimization _    suppose that we have @xmath1 different maps of the same region of the sky made using @xmath1 different channels with frequencies @xmath2 .",
    "the flux of each point source @xmath3 is a function of frequency and , therefore , differs from one channel to another , while the position of this source is , obviously , the same for all maps . in this subsection",
    ", we consider for simplicity one particular population of point sources with the same dependence of fluxes on frequency .",
    "the contribution of point sources to the the temperature on the cmb map in the j - th frequency channel can be written as a set of dirac delta functions with coefficients @xmath4 proportional to the flux of the source at position @xmath5 :    @xmath6    here , @xmath7 is the total number of point sources .",
    "the temperature fluctuations on the map convolved with the antenna beam are therefore :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the beam for the j - th channel , the amplitude of the point source @xmath10 is proportional to the flux and depends on the antenna width : @xmath11 . the coefficients @xmath12 have zero mean and variance @xmath13 ( pixel noise is not convolved with the beam ) .",
    "the set of harmonics @xmath14 can be considered as the n - dimensional vector : @xmath15 .",
    "the aim of our paper is to combine @xmath1 given maps with known values of the expected noise to construct the map with the best signal - to - noise ratio . in order to produce such a map ,",
    "we introduce the vector - filter @xmath16 with components @xmath17 and consider the combination of n maps in the following form :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 .",
    "we consider a symmetric antenna beam and subsequently drop the subscript m because @xmath20 .",
    "thus the filter that we use should depend on l only : @xmath21 .",
    "our approach can readily be generalized to the case of an anisotropic beam , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our problem now is to find vectors @xmath22 for each @xmath23 so that the ratio @xmath24 is maximized :    @xmath25    here @xmath26 is the vector with components @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the beam ) and @xmath29 $ ] is the covariance matrix : @xmath30 . in our calculations ,",
    "we use :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the kronecker symbol . the ratio @xmath33 from equation ( 4 ) is maximized",
    "if we choose the filter to be :    @xmath34    consequently , one can conclude that point sources with some particular dependency of flux on frequency are most clearly seen in the map that is the combination of @xmath1 maps taken with these specific weights of harmonics .",
    "if only one channel is under consideration , then this formula becomes especially simple and is exactly the same as the one obtained by tegmark and de oliveira - costa ( to-98 ) :    @xmath35    using equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , one can get the final result for the maximum possible signal - to - noise ratio @xmath33 , which is achieved in the combined map :    @xmath36    _ estimates for the planck experiment _    a multi - frequency analysis gives us the possibility of detecting point sources in coincidence with different frequency maps . in our calculations , we assume the frequency dependence of the intensity for some particular point source population in the form of a simple power law : @xmath37 . multiplying this intensity by the conversion factor between surface brightness and temperature ( tegmark and efstathiou , 1996 ) and taking into account the resolution @xmath38 , one can obtain the dependence of the point source temperature on frequency :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 denotes the planck channel number .",
    "channels are numbered in order of increasing frequency ( see table 1,2 ) .",
    "two different populations have been chosen : radio and far - ir sources . up to about 200 ghz",
    ", we can expect mostly radio sources to be detected , while at higher frequenies far - ir sources dominate .",
    "for the radio source population , we took the spectral index @xmath41 from ( vielva et al . , 2001 )",
    "to be close to zero up to 100 - 200 ghz ( table 1 ) and increasing to @xmath42 at higher frequency . for the far - ir population ,",
    "this spectral index has the opposite behavior and we choose @xmath41 to be @xmath43 for 857 - 352 ghz with practically no contribution from these sources to the signal at lower frequencies .",
    "of course , our estimates are applicable only for these two specific populations .",
    "each particular population of point sources should be investigated separately .",
    "this means that we should perform the combination of channels with specific filters @xmath22 which correspond to the appropriate spectral index @xmath41 for this population .    using the results of the previous subsection",
    ", one can calculate the signal - to - noise ratio for each channel separately @xmath44 ( if only the j - th channel is under consideration ( to-98 ) ) and for the combination of n channels . from eq .",
    "[ 7,8 ] one finds :    @xmath45    the contribution to @xmath46 in each @xmath23 is obviously higher for the combination of maps than for each map separately and consequently @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "( 1,2 ) we show this ratio for two populations ( radio and fir ) as described above .",
    "a significant improvement can be achieved by considering both populations , @xmath48 $ ] , j=1, .. ,10 .",
    "for radio source , s we found @xmath49 and for fir @xmath50 is about 1.2 .",
    "therefore , a more complete catalogue can be produced for this population of sources .",
    "_ special cases and a possible combinations _    let us for simplicity consider a special case by dealing with only two channels with different frequencies : @xmath51 .",
    "since the spectral behavior of different populations of point sources is not well known , we introduce the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "this parameter contains information about amplitudes of temperature fluctuations due to the same point sources in different channels :    @xmath53    in fig .",
    "3 we show the signal - to - noise ratio that can be found applying to-98 filters for the 143 and 217 ghz channels separately and for the combination of these two maps with different possible ratios of amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we choose these two channels because significant steepening or even a break in the point source spectrum due to synchrotron emission is expected over this range of frequencies , so it is hard to predict the exact value of @xmath52 .    for smaller values of @xmath56",
    "quite a large number of point sources are expected to be found in coincidence for different channels .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how does our filter look like if we combine for example the 70 ghz and 100 ghz ( lfi ) maps .    according to formula ( 6 )",
    "one can obtain the filter @xmath57 with components @xmath58 :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 .",
    "using eq [ 5 ] we can investigate the behaviour of these two components at different scales .    for small @xmath23 s that correspond to scales much larger than the antenna resolution ,",
    "the instrumental noise is negligible ( at least for the low frequency channels : @xmath61 ) and :    @xmath62    substituting [ 13 ] in [ 12 ] we obtain :    @xmath63    therefore , harmonics with small @xmath23 from different channels are taken with the opposite sign .",
    "thus the contributions from the first and second maps to the combined map compensate each other .",
    "finally the total signal in the combined map turns to be close to zero at large scales .",
    "this means that our filter removes contributions from the cmb and other physical components at scales larger that the typical scale of the point sources .    for @xmath23 values that correspond to scales comparable with the antenna beam ,",
    "the pixel noise is dominant and :    @xmath64    therefore the components of the filter @xmath22 are close to the filters found in to-98 for each channel separately ( see fig.4 ) :    @xmath65    these components are both positive and add to form peaks that correspond to point sources in the combined map .",
    "we have presented an analysis of microwave sky observations based on the combination of channels with different frequencies in order to separate extragalactic point sources for subsequent production of a point source catalogue .",
    "we made some numerical estimates for the future planck experiment and showed that a multi - frequency analysis allows us to increase the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor of 1.2 - 4.4 to create a more complete and precise catalog of point sources .",
    ".results of combination of 10 planck channels for the population of radio sources with given spectral behavior .",

    "we show this ratio for the best combination of channels from 1 to j. this means that the 2-nd row gives the result for the combination of the 1-st and 2-nd channels , 3-d means the combination of 1,2,3 channels and so on .",
