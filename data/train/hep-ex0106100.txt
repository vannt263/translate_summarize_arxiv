    "the efficiency due to the @xmath85 cut ( @xmath124 ) is evaluated from monte carlo at present .",
    "the da@xmath1ne accelerator does not have luminosity monitors at small angles ( like e.g. lep ) due to the existence of focusing quadrupole magnets very close to the interaction point .",

    "the number of lab candidates @xmath127 are counted and normalized to the effective bhabha cross section , obtained from monte carlo :    @xmath128    hence , the precision of this measurement depends on : ( i ) the theoretical knowledge of the bhabha scattering process including radiative corrections ; ( ii ) the simulation of the process by the detector simulation program .",
