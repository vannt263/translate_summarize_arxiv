    "a deterministic formulation of quantum mechanics , which is equivalent to the usual theory with respect to the prediction of experimental results , had originally been proposed by d. bohm @xcite and attracted some interest recently @xcite .",
    "this alternative interpretation provides additional insight in various topics in quantum mechanics like the definition of quantum chaos analogously to the classical case @xcite or the derivation of the statistical postulates of a measurement process from a deterministic theory @xcite .    due to the nature of the theory containing a classical particle , whose dynamics",
    "is determined by the quantum mechanical wavefunction , the transition from quantum behaviour for elementary particles and classical motion of heavy point particles is continous . in this framework",
    "the classical limit is simpler and more intuitive than in the conventional theory , avoiding e.g. the introduction of coherent states @xcite .",
    "the problem , why normal macroscopic objects , which are not elementary , but contain a large number of microscopic , quantum mechanical subsystems , behave classically , is much less trivial and has up to now not been worked out in the framework of the bohmian theory .",
    "an additional important issue is to understand the relation between the nonpredictibility features of the quantum mechanical measurement process @xcite and a classical measurement , which does not affect the state of the system .",
    "the proof that the center of mass motion of a macroscopic system is under certain assumptions classical will be the main aim of the following investigations .",
    "the necessary characterizations of the wavefunction will thereby have a simple intuitive meaning in terms of forces on the bohmian particle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a short review of the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics ( chap . [ kapbohm ] ) , the classical limit of macrocopic objects is characterized ( chap .",
    "[ macrosection ] ) and the classical equations of motion for the center of mass coordinates are derived ( chap .",
    "[ centerchap ] ) .",
    "within the bohmian mechanics @xcite , a state of a system is completely determined not only by the wavefunction @xmath0 , but also by the position @xmath1 of a hidden particle in the configuration space of the system .",
    "the dynamics of the wavefunction @xmath0 is determined by the schrdinger equation in the usual way , while the dynamics of the particle is deduced from the wavefunction @xmath2 .    by introducing the modulus @xmath3 and the phase @xmath4 of the wavefunction @xmath5 the schrdinger equation",
    "can be written as @xmath6    @xmath7    while equation ( [ ko ] ) represents a continuity equation of @xmath8 , equation ( [ hj ] ) is a hamilton jacobi equation of a classical particle with coordinate @xmath9 in the presence of both the classical potential @xmath10 and the so - called quantum potential @xcite @xmath11    in particular the momentum @xmath12 and the energy @xmath13 of the particle are given by derivatives of the phase @xmath4 of the wavefunction @xmath2 : @xmath14 this first - order differential equation is sufficient to calculate the trajectory @xmath15 from the initial value @xmath16 , but the relative significance of classical and quantum mechanical effects becomes clearer in a different representation . after a straightforward calculation ( cf .",
    "appendix [ appendix1 ] ) the equation of motion of the bohmian particle @xmath17 can be presented in a form , which is similar to newton s law , but contains a quantum force @xmath18 in addition : @xmath19",
    "one of the intuitive features of the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics is the fact that there is a continous and simple limit from the quantum to the classical regime of a single degree of freedom . by increasing the mass @xmath20 of the particle , i.e. @xmath21 , the quantum force @xmath22 in equ .",
    "[ 2f ] vanishes and the quantum potential @xmath23 becomes irrelevant in the hamilton - jacobi equation [ hj ] .",
    "the absence of quantum mechanical interactions @xmath24 in addition to the classical potential @xmath25 also provides a natural explanation , why the state of a classical system of this kind will not be affected during a measurement .    if and under what circumstances the collective motion of objects consisting out of a macrocopic number @xmath26 of quantum mechanical systems of mass @xmath20 with @xmath27 is classical , is far less obvious and will be investigated in the following .",
    "thereby it turns out that additional assumptions have to be made in order to recover classical physics and to exclude macroscopic quantum phenomena like superconductivity or superfluidity .",
    "let the macrocopic system consist of @xmath28 subsystems , e.g. atoms , with center of mass coordinates @xmath29 for @xmath30 , which are determined by",
    "the wavefunction @xmath31 thereby the exchange symmetry of the indistinguishable particles has been built in by a summation over the permutations @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) with appropriate coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "having in mind classical systems like solids , fluids or gases consisting of a large number of atoms , which show no quantum behaviour like bose - einstein condensation , we can assume the following two features :    _ ( i ) locality : _ the quantum mechanical motion of the center of mass coordinates of different subsystems , which are determined by the wavefunction @xmath35 via equ .",
    "[ hj ] , are assumed to be confined to disjunct regions in configuration space .",
    "this can be motivated by the physical picture that the quantum mechanical uncertainity of the position of the center of mass is much smaller than the minimal distance , i.e. the radius of the atom , of the subsystems .",
    "more explicitly this feature manifests itself as a vanishing overlap of the functions @xmath36 corresponding to different permutations of the center of mass coordinates : @xmath37 in the bohmian interpretation this means that the particle @xmath38 can not tunnel from the support @xmath39 of one wavepacket @xmath40 to another .",
    "consequently the ergodicity of its trajectory @xmath17 is restricted to a certain subset @xmath41 and the other parts @xmath36 ( @xmath42 ) of the wavefunction can be neglected without loss of generality .",
    "note that here the selection of a certain sector @xmath43 is given by the position of the particle and not due to the collapse of the wavefunction after a measurement .    as an example",
    "the expectation value @xmath44 of the center of mass coordinate @xmath45 has to be averaged over the support @xmath46 only .",
    "note that @xmath47 denotes the average position of the center of mass in an infinite number of measurements and is not identical with the position @xmath29 of the bohmian particle . the locality assumption ( i )",
    "can therefore be expressed more precisely by the statement that @xmath48 is small compared with the minimal distance of the center of mass coordinates of the subsystems .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath49 is expressed schematically for the two - dimensional case in figure [ abb.6.2 ] and the index @xmath43 of the wavefunction @xmath50 will be suppressed in the following .",
    "=    _ ( ii ) factorization : _ in addition to this , the factorization of the wavefunction @xmath51 within each disjunct region @xmath52 turns out to be essential for the elimination of macroscopic quantum mechanical correlations .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the ( ad hoc ) introduction of `` decoherence '' for the reconstruction of classical mechanics from the conventional quantum theory @xcite and will be justified intuitively in the following .    as a consequence",
    ", the modulus @xmath53 factorizes due to the decoherence assumption ( ii ) of equ .",
    "[ factorization ] and the quantum potential @xmath54 is a sum of one particle potentials .",

    "an important corollary of the calculation presented here is that there is no quantum mechanical interaction between collective classical coordinates of two macroscopic objects , one representing a measurement device and the other one being the system to be measured .",
    "therefore in a classical measurement the effect of the quantum potentials of the underlying microscopic subsystems neither causes any uncertainity in the measurement result nor affects the system to be measured beyond the classical interaction .    in order to clarify our characterisation of conventional classical systems further",

    "the quantum potential becomes irrelevant , defining the classical limit in a conceptually clear way .",
    "in contrast to this , it was shown that additional restrictions on a many - body wavefunction have to be employed to recover newton s law for the center of mass motion .    one main assumption concerned the fact that the wave function is sufficiently localized to prevent the bohmian center of mass particle of an atom from leaving this subsystem .",
    "in addition to this , an appropriate factorization of the modulus @xmath99 of the wavefunction is essential ( cf .",
