    "the epoch of reionisation ( eor ) is the last global phase transition of the universe , during which the birth of first luminous sources gradually ionised the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . given that this epoch remains mostly unexplored , current eor studies are devoted to answering its most basic questions : when did the eor begin ?",
    "what are the sources responsible for driving reionisation ?",
    "how did the topology of reionisation evolve ?",
    "when did the eor end ?",
    "accurate answers for these questions are crucial to understand the early stages of galaxy formation and evolution",
    ".    observations of the high - redshift quasars ly@xmath10  absorption spectra  @xcite suggest that reionisation of the igm completed about @xmath11 , though there is some evidence for variations in this  @xcite .",
    "the recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization measurements by  @xcite reported a thomson electron scattering optical depth out to the surface of last scattering of @xmath12 , lower than previous measures by wmap  @xcite , thus reducing the need for exotic ionising sources within high redshift star - forming galaxies  @xcite .",
    "these observations constrain the topology , sources , and evolution of the eor , albeit only crudely .",
    "the detailed evolution of spatially - inhomogeneous reionisation involves a complex interplay between evolving source populations , the propagation of ionising photons within a patchy igm , and the enrichment of the first galaxies and halos that may affect the nature of the ionising sources .    a promising approach to tracking the evolution of neutral hydrogen during the eor is via its emission in the redshifted hyperfine 21-cm line .",
    "the advantage of using the 21-cm line is that its brightness temperature is directly proportional to neutral gas content ( @xmath13 ) which makes it possible to study the three - dimensional distribution of the neutral gas and the large scale structure during the eor  @xcite .",
    "hence the eor is a key science goal for current and future low - frequency ( @xmath14  mhz ) radio telescopes .",
    "these experiments include the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , the precision array to probe epoch of reionisation ( paper ) , the hydrogen epoch of reionisation array ( hera ) and eventually the square kilometer array ( ska - low ) .",
    "owing to the relatively coarse angular resolution at these long wavelengths , interpreting these observations fully requires understanding how small - scale processes such as the production and propagation of ionising photons impact the large - scale neutral gas distribution .    to this end",
    ", numerous theoretical studies have focused on modeling the eor process and its expected 21-cm signal .",
    "a key limiting factor is the need for vast dynamic range that remains a computational challenge .",
    "proper cosmological simulations of the eor must resolve the smallest proto - galaxies to track the local generation and propagation of the ionizing photons , as well as their recombinations which requires modeling the small - scale clumping of gas , from sub-@xmath15 scales up to the sizes of the largest ionising bubbles during the late stages of the eor , believed to be tens of @xmath16  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this requires both large - volume simulations together with extremely high resolution .",
    "for instance , the forthcoming eor surveys by ska - low will span a field - of - view of about 10 degrees that corresponds to a size of @xmath17  mpc with @xmath18  mpc resolution  @xcite , while the proto - galaxies that are thought to provide the dominant source of ionising photons likely have scale sizes below a kpc  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "early hydrodynamic simulations of the eor applied post - processed radiative transfer to cosmologically - evolved density fields  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which enabled the study of reionisation topology but did not self - consistently include the feedback effects of the ionisation on galaxies .",
    "more recent codes such as march  @xcite and traphic  @xcite have been developed to do full radiative hydrodynamics in a cosmological galaxy formation code , including feedback processes constrained to match available high-@xmath19 data  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these simulations are computationally very expensive , and the requirement that the simulation resolve to below the hydrogen cooling halo mass limit of @xmath20 drives one to a quite small box size ( see however  @xcite ) , typically @xmath21  mpc .",
    "a complementary approach is to use a large volume ( @xmath22  mpc ) simulations that employ physically - motivated parameterizations to determine the location and evolution of the source population , even though they do not resolve individual galaxy sources .",
    "these so - called semi - numerical models have low computational cost since they do not require radiative transfer and they determine the density field evolution from analytic prescriptions such as excursion set formalism  @xcite .",
    "a key free parameter in such codes is the ionizing efficiency per unit ( halo ) mass , generally assumed to be constant and tuned to match key observations .",
    "semi - numerical models have been shown to roughly reproduce the ionisation history and 21-cm power spectrum as obtained from radiative hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , the simplicity of the source parameterisations and the fact that they neglect recombinations means that they fail to account for all of the relevant inhomogeneous physical processes required to properly address the problem .",
    "@xcite have recently improved their semi - numerical code by incorporating inhomogeneous recombinations using a sub - grid prescription that self - consistently tracks the evolution of ionizing sources and recombination systems , as well as accounting for feedback effects . while an improvement over previous semi - numerical work , the parameterisations are obtained without self - consistently accounting for galactic feedback processes , and hence still employ a constant efficiency parameter ( i.e. ionising photon rate per unit dark matter halo mass @xmath23 ) to characterise the source population .",
    "in contrast , radiative hydrodynamic simulations tuned to match high-@xmath19 galaxy properties find that the star formation rate , and hence relatedly the ionising photon rate , scales super - linearly with halo mass at these epochs , typically as @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the clumping factor that controls the recombination rate is set by a complex interplay between photon propagation as a function of environment , which is best followed using full radiative hydrodynamic simulations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence there remains room for improvement in semi - numerical eor models .",
    "in this paper we aim to take the next step by implementing calibrated relations for the non - linearly mass - dependent ionisation efficiency and inhomogeneous recombination rates taken from high - resolution radiative hydrodynamic ( rt ) simulations into the semi - numerical eor code simfast21  @xcite .",
    "we use simulations from @xcite that have been previously calibrated to match various observations of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "we derive new parametrizations for the non - linear ionisation ( @xmath0 ) and recombination ( @xmath1 ) rates directly from this radiative hydrodynamic simulation as a function of halo mass and redshift , complemented by a larger - volume galaxy formation simulation without radiative transfer to help bridge the small scales in the rt simulation to the large - scale semi - numerical model .",
    "we implement these new formulae for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that track the evolution of the non - linear ionisations and inhomogeneous recombinations into simfast21 .",
    "we constrain our one free model parameter , the escape fraction , to simultaneously match observations of the planck thomson optical depth , the late evolution of the lyman alpha mean opacity , and the ionising emissivity at @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we make predictions for the expected 21-cm power spectrum from the eor , and particularly investigate how our new physical parameterisations alter the predicted signal",
    ". this new version of our simfast21 will soon be publicly available .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sims ] , we introduce the simulations used , namely simfast21 , the radiative hydrodynamic simulations , and the non - radiative larger - volume simulation . in section",
    "[ sec : param ] , we present our new parametrizations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 from hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we present our key observables in section [ sec : results ] , explore the impact of our new parameterisations in section [ sec : impact ] and conclude in section [ sec : conc ] . throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath26cdm cosmology in which @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , a primordial power spectrum index @xmath30 , an amplitude of the mass fluctuations scaled to @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we quote all results in comoving units , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we describe simfast21  @xcite and , in particular , focus on how the ionized regions are identified using a fixed efficiency parameter .",
    "we then briefly describe the two complementary suites of the state - of - the - art hydrodynamic simulations , namely a high - resolution radiative hydrodynamic simulation  ( * 6/256-rt * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a larger - volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation without radiative transfer  ( * 32/512 * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we employ to obtain new parametrizations of the non - linear ionisation and inhomogeneous recombination rates .",
    "a summary of our simulations is shown below in table  [ simtab ] .",
    "simfast21 is a semi - numerical code that predicts the redshifted 21-cm signal from cosmic reionisation .",
    "simfast21 simulation uses a monte - carlo approach to evolve the density field from a gaussian random initial state to form collapsed structures based on a spherical collapse density threshold .",
    "this prescription generally follows the algorithm described in @xcite , which we briefly review here .    at very high redshift",
    ", the dark matter density field is distributed linearly onto a grid , and the linear gravitational corrections are added by applying the @xcite approximation to evolve to lower redshifts .",
    "the collapsed dark matter halos are specified using the excursion - set formalism with an overdensity threshold of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the linear growth factor .",
    "ionized regions are identified using a similar form of the excursion - set algorithm , based on the assumption of a constant efficiency parameter of ionising photon per unit halo mass , @xmath35 .",
    "the ionisation condition for any given region is simply the amount of collapsed dark matter halo @xmath36 compared with the efficiency parameter @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the region is considered to be fully ionized if : @xmath37 and fully neutral if not .",
    "for single cells which are not covered by ionised bubbles , we set their ionised fraction to @xmath38 . using this condition , the ionisation field",
    "is generated that is the main input required to compute the predicted 21-cm signal .",
    "@xmath35 encapsulates a mixture of the ionisation and recombination processes such as ionising radiation escape fraction and recombinations by lyman limit systems ( lls ) .",
    "however , it implicitly assumes that the recombinations trace the halos in the same way as the ionisations , which is unlikely to be true in detail .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath35 can be tuned to match observations and yield predicted 21-cm power spectra .    in  [ sec : modify ] we will describe our improvements to this scheme . in particular , we aim to improve the following aspects from the previous version of simfast21 :    * no explicit modeling of recombinations .",
    "recombinations are only implicitly modeled via the constant efficiency parameter , which does not account for inhomogeneities in the density field and the local clumping factor . * the use of a constant efficiency parameter .",
    "we will show that this is not an optimal description of the ionisation rate as a function of halo mass .",
    "* regions identified as fully ionised are set to have a neutral fraction of zero .",
    "more realistically , they should have a small neutral fraction appropriate for an optically - thin portion of the universe in ionisation equilibrium . *",
    "the density field spatial distribution .",
    "the original code uses nearest grid point assignment of density field to cells , but this can result in a biased density field distribution with unexpected voids when applying the @xcite approximation .",
    "a typical run with simfast21 will have a volume of several hundred mpc and a cell size of several hundred kpc .",
    "hence this method can not resolve the galaxies that are the sources of ionising photons in the eor , nor the clumped density field that governs recombinations .",
    "therefore , to develop a better sub - grid model for these processes , we need to employ high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation that can resolve these processes directly .",
    "next we describe these hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "to resolve the smallest significantly star - forming halos , we use the recent radiative transfer cosmological hydrodynamic simulation described more fully in @xcite .",
    "this simulation uses the gadget-3 smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code  @xcite , merged with the radiative transfer code march  @xcite to run a fully self - consistent radiative hydrodynamic simulation of early galaxy formation .",
    "built on the version of gadget developed by @xcite , this code incorporates well - constrained models for star formation - driven feedback processes , that do a generally good job of matching observed lower - redshift galaxy and igm properties  @xcite .",
    "the particular run we use , which we will call * 6/256-rt * , employs a small volume of @xmath39 and evolves @xmath40 particles .",
    "the mass of each gas particle is @xmath41 whereas the dark matter particle is about @xmath42 more massive .",
    "we therefore can resolve halos down to hydrogen cooling limit at @xmath43 with 65 ( dark matter+gas ) particles , and galaxies down to stellar masses of @xmath44 with 32  gas particles .",
    "the equivalent plummer gravitational softening length employed is 469  pc ( comoving ) , corresponding to around 50  physical pc at the epoch of interest .",
    "it is crucial that our simulation resolves halos down to the hydrogen cooling limit , and therefore should be resolving essentially all the ionising photon output during the eor under the assumption that halos below the hydrogen cooling limit do not contribute substantially to the photon budget , as is now generally believed  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this simulation also includes a subgrid monte carlo model for kinetic galactic outflows , following the  ezw \" prescription described in @xcite .",
    "the two free parameters are the mass loading factor @xmath45 and wind speed @xmath46 , which vary with galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath47 that is calculated using an on - the - fly friends - of - friends galaxy identification code .",
    "the ezw prescription employs momentum - driven wind scalings ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) in sizable galaxies ( @xmath50 ) , and energy driven scalings ( @xmath51 ) in dwarf galaxies . to mock up outflows blowing channels through the interstellar medium ( ism ) , hydrodynamic forces",
    "are turned off until either the particle reaches 10% of sf critical density or a time of @xmath52  yr has passed . these scalings result in many predictions for galaxy and igm properties that agree reasonably well with observations  @xcite .",
    "this version of gadget also includes a model for chemical enrichment following type  ii and type  ia supernovae and stellar evolution , as well as primordial and metal cooling .",
    "the star formation model follows the multi - phase model in @xcite , with a density threshold of @xmath53 . a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed throughout .",
    "radiative cooling follows the prescription in @xcite to include the primordial cooling , and @xcite collisional ionisation equilibrium tables to account for cooling from metal lines .",
    "the radiative transfer is done during the simulation run on a grid of @xmath54 voxels , and its evolution is tracked using a moment - based method , together with a long characteristics code periodically employed to calculate the eddington tensor in each cell in order to close the moment hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium ionisation state of the gas is followed by interpolating the ionisation field to the location of each gas particle .",
    "sixteen separate frequency groups are followed , evenly spaced between @xmath55  ryd .",
    "while the code is high resolution by cosmological standards , it lacks sufficient resolution to directly predict the escape of ionising photons from star - forming regions .",
    "hence there is still an assumption required for the escape fraction of ionising photons , @xmath56 . in this run ,",
    "a mass- and redshift - dependent @xmath56 is employed , which results in @xmath57 in halos with mass @xmath58 , dropping with both mass and time to around 5% at @xmath59 in more massive halos ; the full formula is in equation  1 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this simulation , with its @xmath56 as assumed , can simultaneously match two key eor observations , namely the optical depth to thomson scattering from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe  ( wmap ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) polarization - temperature cross - correlation , and the volume - averaged neutral fraction at @xmath60  @xcite measured from the ly@xmath10 forest .",
    "hence it is a plausible model for the evolution of the ionising background during the eor .    as an important aside",
    ", we point out an inconsistency in this paper regarding our assumed @xmath56 : we will use this rt simulation s output to provide a description for the ionising photon rate that we will implement into simfast21 , but then we will re - tune @xmath56 in our semi - numerical runs to a substantially different value than what was assumed in the rt simulation .",
    "ideally , we would re - run our rt simulation with the new @xmath56 , and iterate until convergence . beyond the prohibitive computational cost to do so , there is a more fundamental reason why this is not feasible : the volume of our rt simulation is too small to fully capture even the moderately massive halos that ( as we show later ) contribute significantly to the ionising photon budget particularly during the latter stages of the eor .",
    "therefore , the @xmath56 used in the rt simulation is tuned to high values at early stages of the eor to compensate for those missing halos .",
    "however , the critical input from rt simulation is the slope of the star formation rate ",
    "halo mass ( sfr@xmath61 ) relation ( sfr  @xmath24 ) , which is sensitive to feedback from stellar energy and the uvb at low masses .",
    "hence it is appropriate to boost the @xmath56 in the rt simulation in order to model a realistic uvb evolution , as this in turn yields a more realistic sfr(@xmath62 ) prediction .",
    "although the @xmath56 assumed in the rt simulation is not self - consistent , the fact that it reproduces key eor observables including the uv luminosity function means that it likely represents a plausible evolution for the ionising photon output and neutral gas density field over the scales that are modeled .",
    "hence while at present there is no practical way to avoid this inconsistency , it nonetheless provides an appropriate characterisation of the parameters we need for our large - scale modeling .",
    "while the rt simulation described above accurately follows the interplay between photoionisation and galaxy formation , it lacks the volume to produce sufficiently large halos that are an important contributor to reionisation .",
    "since we want to evolve large volumes with simfast21 , we would like to have an  intermediate \" sized simulation that effectively bridges the gap , and allows the computation of ionisation and recombination rates in more massive halos . for this purpose , we will use a larger - volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that does not include radiative transfer . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "radiative transfer effects are only important in  photo - sensitive \" halos with @xmath63 , and hence we will only utilize this simulation for halos larger than this .",
    "the simulation we employ has been fully described in @xcite ; here we review the basic details .",
    "this simulation uses the gadget-2  n - body+sph code  @xcite to model a cubic volume of @xmath64 on a side and @xmath65 particles of dark matter and gas each ; we refer to this as our * 32/512 * run .",
    "each gas particle has a mass of about @xmath66 , allowing us to resolve galaxies down to stellar masses of around @xmath67 , and halo masses of around @xmath68 .",
    "most of the physics is identical to the rt run , including the radiative cooling , star formation following @xcite , the chemical evolution model , and the  ezw \" prescription for galactic outflows .",
    "one difference is that , unlike in the rt run , ionisation equilibrium is assumed throughout , taking a spatially - uniform ionising background as given by @xcite .",
    "also , this simulation includes a model to quench star formation in massive galaxies , but this does not come into play at the early epochs that we consider here .    the overall strategy is to parameterise the ionisation and recombination rates taken from the * 6/256-rt * and * 32/512 * runs , and insert those parameterisations into simfast21 .",
    "next we describe how this is done .",
    "we aim to obtain new parameterizations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that capture environmental and feedback effects directly from the * 32/512 * and * 6/256-rt * simulations , in order to implement them into simfast21 . to begin , we must determine the ionisation and recombination rates of our simulated gas particles .      to determine the ionisation rate of each gas particle , we take directly from the * 6/256-rt * and * 32/512 * simulations output the star formation rate ( sfr ) and metallicity ( z ) .",
    "we then compute the ionisation rate using equation  ( 2 ) in  @xcite , which is derived from  @xcite models .",
    "given an ionisation photon output rate for each particle , we then sum this over all the star - forming gas particles within a given halo to determine @xmath0 for that halo .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nion ] , we show @xmath0 as a function of halo mass for halos at @xmath69 ( top to bottom panels ) .",
    "to increase dynamic range , we combine the * 6/256-rt * ( green dots ) and * 32/512 * ( blue dots ) simulations , thereby covering dark matter halo masses of @xmath70 .",
    "importantly , the values of @xmath0 among the two simulations is quite similar in the overlap region of @xmath71 , with only a very slight tendency for the smaller volume to have higher @xmath0 . at low halo masses ( @xmath72 )",
    "we see a turn - down in @xmath0 owing to photo - suppression of galaxy formation  @xcite . at high masses ,",
    "@xmath0 follows a power law that is approximately @xmath73 , consistent with what the dependence on sfr with @xmath23 found in similar simulations by @xcite .",
    "the red vertical error bars show the 1@xmath47 scatter in @xmath0 in @xmath74 bins of @xmath75 . at @xmath76 , @xmath77 independent of redshift .",
    "note that when implementing @xmath0 into simfast21 , we will average over many halos in each cell which will reduce the scatter further , therefore the scatter is unlikely to systematically impact the 21-power spectrum .",
    "qualitatively , introducing scatter in @xmath0 would introduce larger hii bubbles in diffuse regions and smaller ones in overdense ones , blurring the effect of the @xmath0 dependence on @xmath78 and suppressing large - scale fluctuations .",
    "these effects are likely to be small given the small scatter , which only increases substantially at the lowest masses that ( we will show later ) are not driving reionisation .",
    "the key goal of the current work is to improve on previous work by allowing @xmath0 to vary with halo mass in a physically - motivated way rather than assuming a constant value .",
    "we therefore defer a detailed investigation into the impact of scatter to future work .    to check if these simulated values for @xmath0 are reasonable , we compare to the sfr inferred from observations using abundance matching by @xcite , shown as the dark red vertical error bars at @xmath79 ( this is the lowest halo mass at which they computed the sfr ) . to convert from sfr to @xmath0 ,",
    "we invert the process described above , assuming a metallicity corresponding to the mean metallicity of star - forming gas at that epoch .",
    "the agreement is within the quoted uncertainty by @xcite , but in detail we see that our hydrodynamic simulations ( * 6/256-rt , 32/512 * ) produce an @xmath0 that is higher by a factor @xmath80 compared to that inferred by @xcite .",
    "we will return to this point in  [ sec : fesc ] .    to implement @xmath0 into simfast21",
    ", we construct a fitting function for @xmath81 whose mass dependence is analogous to a schechter function , namely a power - law on one end and an exponential cutoff on the other , and whose redshift dependence is as a power law in the scale factor , namely : @xmath82 we perform a minimization to determine the best - fit parameters to be @xmath83s@xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . note that equation   shows that @xmath0 scales as @xmath88 , which is consistent with the sfr@xmath89 relation that previously found by @xcite .     computed from * 6/256-rt * ( blue dots ) and",

    "the red vertical error bars represent @xmath47 values for @xmath74 bin size of @xmath75 .",
    "the scatter is fairly small , so is unlikely to systematically impact the 21-power spectrum .",
    "the dark red vertical error bars at @xmath79 are computed using sfr measurements from @xcite .",
    "our fitting function nicely reproduces the ionisation rate @xmath0 computed from our hydrodynamic simulations and only higher by a factor of @xmath80 than @xcite observations . ]",
    "we note that at low redshifts ( e.g. today ) , the high - mass end of @xmath91 would likely have a sharp turn - down owing to quenching of star formation in @xmath92 halos  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". we do not produce such large halos by @xmath93 in these hydro simulations , although it is possible that our simfast21 volume will be sufficiently large to yield halos above this mass .",
    "nonetheless , there are suggestions that the quenching mass scale is higher at high redshifts  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , the best - fit parameterisation of the equilibrium galaxy formation model in @xcite suggests that at @xmath94 , the quenching mass scale is close to @xmath95 , which is larger than any halo existing during the eor .",
    "hence we ignore the possibility of a high - mass turn - down in @xmath0 for now .",
    "since the recombination rate @xmath1 depends on the density field and its clumping , we choose to parameterise @xmath1 per unit volume in terms of the local scaled density @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the matter density and @xmath98 is the cosmic mean at that redshift . then in simfast21",
    ", we can apply this recombination rate to individual cells where we can compute the scaled density .",
    "also , because we want to characterise the inhomogeneous recombination rate during the eor , we can only use the full radiative hydrodynamic simulation for this , namely * 6/256-rt * , and we do not employ the * 32/512 * run here . unfortunately , this limits our dynamic range and requires a larger extrapolation to cover the range of overdensities that are achieved in our large simfast21 volume , which is an unavoidable limitation given computational capabilities .    since the clumping and hence @xmath1 is sensitive to scale  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we must choose a particular scale over which to compute @xmath99 and hence @xmath1 . here",
    "we choose to subdivide our @xmath39 simulation into 16 cells per side , which yields a cell size of @xmath100  mpc ( comoving ) .",
    "this then necessarily fixes the cell size that we will use for our simfast21 runs to a value that enables us to feasibly simulate sufficiently large volumes for computing the 21-cm power spectrum on the scales of relevance for current and upcoming observations .",
    "we smooth the mass of each gas particle onto these cells using a 5th - order b - spline kernel with 128 neighbours as utilised in the 6/256-rt simulation @xcite .    within each so - defined cell in the * 6/256-rt * simulation , we compute the volume - averaged recombination rate density , @xmath101 , as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is ionized hydrogen number density , @xmath104 is the free electrons number density , @xmath105 is the cell s ionised volume fraction , and @xmath106 , that corresponds to a temperature of @xmath107 .",
    "we consider case - a recombination following the recent paper by @xcite , where it has been shown that case - a recombination photons mimic the scenario of those photons redshifted out of resonance , and therefore can no longer be ionising photons .",

    "note that the redshift dependence is slightly weaker than the expected @xmath127 owing to the evolution of the clumping factor  @xcite .",

    "we note that this criterion assumes that , once a particular region satisfies this criterion , it is quickly able to ionise the vast majority of its neutral gas .",
    "this is an approximation , but one expects that the increasing rate of ionising photon production in the early universe together with the dropping cosmic density will in general yield a fast transition to being fully reionised .",
    "indeed , such a quick transition is typically seen for entire simulation volumes  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and we will later show this for our models as well ) , and it is physically reasonable to expect such rapid reionisation will also occur locally . to rigorously assess",
    "its validity we would need to do a full radiative transfer simulation , which we leave for future work .    in the original simfast21 , an ionised cell was set to @xmath129 . in reality , even a fully - reionised patch of the universe has some small residual neutral fraction @xmath130 , which depends on the global ionising background and overdensity  @xcite .",

    "it is seen that the ionised gas forms bubbles of increasing size , corresponding to a classic inside - out topology where the densest regions are ionised first .",
    "while illustrative , for actually computing the 21-cm power spectrum we will not use the light cone in figure  [ fig : ion3 ] but rather individual snapshots at various redshifts , since it has been shown by @xcite that the light cone effect are small for our box size .",
    "the goal of the redshifted 21-cm eor observations is to constrain this bubble size distribution and its evolution through measurements of the power spectrum , thereby providing constraints on the topology and sources of reionisation .",
    "as noted earlier in figure  [ fig : nion ] , it appears that the global ionisation rate , and by proxy the star formation rate , at a given halo mass in our hydrodynamical simulations may be high by a factor of 1.5 @xmath169 compared to observations . to investigate this in more detail ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : sfr ] the star formation rate function from our simfast21 using @xmath0 ( blue , dotted - line ) , compared to observations by @xcite at @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , we see that our simulated sfrs are generally higher by this factor across all galaxies .",
    "given that this discrepancy is mostly invariant with star formation rate , for the purposes of eor modeling it can be directly translated into a correction factor on the escape fraction . in other words , if we corrected our @xmath0 values down by a factor of 1.5 ( normalized @xmath0 ) to account for the mismatch in sfrs ( green solied line in figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) , we could raise our @xmath56 values by a factor of 1.5 and obtain the exact same results for the 21  cm power spectrum ( see figure  [ fig : pk2 ] ) ; there is no impact on the predicted power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations for a model whose @xmath56 is tuned to match observations of the history of reionization .",
    "hence if we take the observations of @xcite at face value , we require an escape fraction of @xmath170% to match the various eor observations described above .",
    "this would alleviate some of the discrepancy between our value and that inferred by @xcite , who argued for @xmath171 from observations . at the same time",
    ", it is not in conflict with direct observational constraints on @xmath56 , which tend to prefer values of less than @xmath172    to summarize , our simulation with the new version of simfast21 yields the somewhat remarkable result that a constant escape fraction of 4% , independent of mass or redshift , is sufficient to match observational constraints on both the onset and end of reionisation .",
    "this value may be increased to 6% when we fine - tune our model to match observed star formation rate measurements of @xcite using the normalized @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite also argued for a relatively modest escape fraction ( @xmath173 ) based on the new planck @xmath147 , which is somewhat higher than our preferred value .",
    "in contrast , previous works such as @xcite have argued for a substantially varying , and generally much higher , @xmath56 .",
    "even if we constrain to the wmap @xmath174 , we still require an escape fraction of only @xmath175% , still much lower than @xcite ; hence it is not only just the new value of @xmath147 that is driving our lower @xmath56 .",
    "additionally , the key aspect is the large volume of the simfast21 simulation that includes more massive halos relative to small - volume , full - rt simulations .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : massfcn ] that , in our new simfast21 model , these moderate - mass halos are an important contributor to the photon budget , because the ionising photon rate scales super - linearly with halo mass ( eq .  [ eq : nion ] ) .",

    "the presence of more ionised hydrogen in large over - dense regions than under - dense regions suppresses the 21-cm power spectrum . at the intermediate phases , the rapid growth of ionised bubbles boosts the 21-cm power spectrum . at later epochs , when the eor is nearly complete , the 21-cm power spectrum drops rapidly . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:21cmevol ] shows the 21 cm power spectrum at @xmath181=7.25 , 7.5 , 7.75 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 from our 300  mpc , @xmath153-cell simfast21 simulation .",
    "the evolution in figure  [ fig:21cmevol ] qualitatively follows the pattern described in  @xcite : at early times ( z=12 ) , the 21 cm power spectrum traces the density power spectrum , because virtually all of the gas is neutral . during the interval @xmath182 , the tendency for reionisation to begin in the largest overdensities offsets the tendency for such overdensities to host high concentrations of neutral gas .",
    "as soon as the most overdense regions are ionized , the density field of _ neutral _ hydrogen is overall much more homogeneous than prior to reionisation , suppressing large - scale power in 21 cm fluctuations . at later epochs ,",
    "the the ionised regions become larger , leading to more large - scale power .",
    "in essence , this behavior is reflective of inside - out reionisation where the inhomogeneities are first prominent on smaller scales and then move to larger scales .",

    ". variations among these three runs can thus be used to isolate the scale at which recombinations are important .",
    "the * fixedrion * simulation is analogous to using a constant efficiency parameter , but still uses our * full * recombination model ; hence comparing to the * full * model can be used to assess the importance of employing a halo mass - dependent ionisation rate .",
    "the * classic * case is the original simfast21 code , which uses a constant efficiency parameter and no explicit recombinations .",

    "overall , changing the nature of the ionisation sources has a larger impact , at fixed @xmath147 , than varying the recombination methodology . nonetheless , constraining to match @xmath147 results in models having an end of reionisation all within @xmath207 of each other .",
    "hence the global evolution of the neutral fraction is relatively insensitive to our modifications to simfast21 , with the largest difference being relative to a model with no recombinations ( * classic * ) or a small - volume hydrodynamic simulation that does not yield large galaxies ( * 6/256-rt * ) .",
    "we now explore how the topology of reionisation varies amongst our five different physical models .",
    "this is relevant to the 21-cm power spectrum since it focuses on topological features such as the distribution of ionised bubble sizes that directly reflects in the power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , forthcoming observation with the ska can in principle directly map the neutral gas distribution . to get a flavour for the sorts of topology variations introduced by varying our input physics , we begin by examining maps of the ionisation field evolution .    figure [ fig : maps ] shows maps of the ionisation field for the five models across different phases of the eor at @xmath208 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "overall , the universe becomes more ionised at later epochs , and the global neutral fractions are generally similar at the same @xmath19 .",
    "nonetheless , there are clear differences in the topology of the ionised regions amongst the various models .",
    "the * full * and * nosubclump * models display quite similar morphologies across all eor phases as seen in their ionisations maps ( first two columns ) .",
    "this implies that including the sub - grid clumping effects through @xmath1 does not strongly affect the eor topology , and suggests that computing recombinations using only the local cell s densities ( as in * nosubclump * ) is sufficient to properly model the eor .",
    "this is tantamount to saying that the local clumping factor within each cell is close to unity , and the main variations in the clumping factor occur on scales larger than our cell size ; indeed , we have checked that this is the case within the * 6/256-rt * run . while this suggests that including @xmath1 was perhaps superfluous , this outcome was not obvious from the outset .",
    "this perhaps conflicts with the conclusions of @xcite ; their figure  2 suggests that the local clumping fluctuations are quite important .",
    "we then expect that the * full * and * nosubclump * models will accordingly produce the same ionisation and 21-cm power spectra .",
    "the * meanrrec * ionisation maps show relatively larger ionised bubbles ( third column ) than in our fiducial model . hence ignoring the density fluctuations and clumping on large scales and assuming recombinations based on the cosmic mean density is a poor approximation .",
    "this occurs because the * meanrrec * model has fewer recombinations , because the recombinations primarily occur in the dense regions , and the recombination rate scales roughly as the square of the density .",
    "therefore , the ionising photons can propagate farther and create larger bubbles .    at early stages of the eor ( at z=9.5 )",
    ", the * fixedrion * model ( fourth column ) produces smaller ionised bubbles than other models .",
    "this occurs because of the interplay of recombinations and the ionising source locations . given that our reionisation topology is generally inside - out ( dense regions ionising first ) , this means that the dense regions with the largest halos live in regions that are most rapidly recombining .",
    "in the * full * model , the increasing strength of ionising photon output with halo mass helps to offset these rapid recombinations , and power ionising fronts out of the dense regions .",
    "however , in the * fixedrion * model the large halos have lower ionising output , and hence the resultant bubbles grow less before stalling .",
    "conversely , in low - density regions with smaller halos , * fixedrion * will produce larger bubbles .",
    "hence overall , the bubble size distribution is more uniform in this case , which will be evident in the power spectra we consider below .",
    "it is interesting to note that the * meanrrec * and * fixedrion * models share similar morphologies at the intermediate phase of the eor ( @xmath209 ) , which implies that inhomogeneous @xmath1 has roughly a similar level of an effect as including mass - dependent ionisation . given that we have constrained all models to match the _",
    "planck _ optical depth , a  crossover \" at @xmath210 is perhaps not surprising .    finally , the * classic * ( fifth column ) displays a morphology that is between * fixedrion * and * meanrrec * morphologies",
    ". its form of ionisation is most similar to * fixedrion * , but it includes recombinations implicitly through the constrained efficiency parameter @xmath35 ( eq .  [ barrier ] ) as a direct suppression of the number of ionising photons output in each cell .",
    "effectively , this cell - based suppression ends up being stronger than the recombinations in * meanrrec * and weaker than that in * fixedrion * , which sets the * classic * morphology between those of * meanrrec * and * fixedrion *    these results show that assumptions regarding the ionisation and recombination rates in large - scale models can have a significant effect on the topology of reionisation and its evolution .",
    "we now quantify the topology shown in the maps in the previous section .",
    "the approach we use here is to consider the ionised mass fraction as a function of local overdensity , to better understand how our physical assumptions are impacting the ionisation state of the gas in various environments .",
    "figure [ fig : dbin ] shows the mass - weighted global ionised fraction @xmath211 as a function of density @xmath212 of our five models at three different redshifts @xmath213 ( left to right ) , when the neutral fraction is approximately @xmath214 and @xmath215 , with some variations between the models ( the values quoted on the figure are the average @xmath13 of all models at each @xmath203 ) .    in all models and at all times , the over - dense regions ( @xmath216 ) , where the halos and hence the photon sources are more numerous , are more ionised while low - density regions such as voids ( @xmath217 ) take longer to become ionised .",
    "this is due to the gradual progress of the ionisations fronts through the surrounding regions regions into low density regions  @xcite , and the relatively low clumping factor  @xcite and recombination rate particularly in the late eor , which results in these high - density regions remaining ionised .",
    "hence in all these runs , as we saw in the * full * case earlier ( figure  [ fig : ion3 ] ) , reionisation proceeds in an inside - out fashion .",
    "we first compare * full * ( solid blue ) with * nosubclump * ( dashed green ) . in the moderate and low - density regions , these models are essentially identical , except at late times when the ionised fraction in * nosubclump * is slightly higher ( likely an artifact of tuning to the same @xmath147 value ) .",
    "sub - cell gas clumping thus only has an effect in relatively more overdense regions , which physically makes sense since such clumping occurs on small scales .",
    "the impact of sub - cell clumping is maximized at overdensities @xmath218 , whereas in the most dense regions the ionisations overwhelm recombinations regardless of the clumping .",
    "however , the trend is opposite to one might naively expect : the * nosubclump * model actually has a lower ionisation fraction , indicating more recombinations , than the * full * model .",
    "this happens because the * nosubclump * model computes the reionisation rate assuming a fully ionised cell at the cell s density , but the @xmath1 fitting formula used in * full * includes the effect that dense regions have more neutral gas , and hence the recombination rate is lowered compared to the fully ionised case .",
    "comparing * meanrrec * to * full * , we see much more dramatic differences than compared to * nosubclump*. as we have seen from the maps earlier , assuming recombinations only at the mean cosmic density produces quite a different topology .",
    "the ionised fraction is significantly higher in the high - density regions , and lower in the low - density regions , with a crossover around the mean density ( @xmath219 ) . since recombinations scale as the square of the density , dense regions have lower recombination rates in * meanrec * leading to more ionised gas , and conversely low - density regions have higher recombination rates leading to less ionised gas .",
    "the * meanrrec * , * fixedrion * and * classic * have roughly the comparable behaviour of @xmath220 during the early phases of the eor .",
    "this also was clear in their topologies ( figure [ fig : maps ] ) . once these models are constrained to have matching @xmath147 values which governs their early eor evolution , using a mean density recombination rate with inhomogeneous sources turns out to be roughly equivalent in topology to using a fixed ionising output per unit mass and inhomogeneous recombinations . the * classic",
    "* model falls in between these two extremes , with fixed ionising efficiency and the recombinations implicitly tied to the ionisations . at lower redshifts , the three models start to diverge at low densities , as the higher recombination rates at @xmath221 in the * meanrec * model lead to lower ionised fractions than in the * fixedrion * model . the * classic * model is still lower , since the recombinations are tied to ionisations which are very low in the low - density regime .",
    "interestingly , in this regime the * fixedrion * model becomes similar to the * full * case .",
    "overall , our results show that including both inhomogeneous recombinations and ionisations is important to produce the correct topology evolution of the eor .",
    "while neglecting sub - cell recombinations has little impact , assuming either recombinations that are based on the mean density or tied to the ionisation rate results in dramatically different ionised gas topologies .",
    "likewise , using a fixed ionising photon output per unit halo mass results in a substantially different topology during the neutral - dominated phase of the eor , though it becomes more similar to the fiducial case at later stages .      an interesting quantity for observing the eor",
    "is the mass scale of galaxies providing the bulk of the ionising photons .",
    "this is important for future observational programs with for instance the _ james webb space telescope _ , which aims to directly detect these galaxies .",
    "given that we track the ionising output of halos , we can straightforwardly determine the ionising photon distribution as a function of halo mass , and assess the impact of our new input physics on this .",
    "we consider only on our fiducial ( * full * ) and * fixedrion * models , to compare the total amount of emitted ionising photons per halo mass in each model at fixed @xmath147 , since we are not concerned with recombinations here .",
    "figure [ fig : hist ] shows histograms of the total ionising emissivity @xmath222 for halo mass bins of the * full * ( blue ) and * fixedrion * ( cyan ) at @xmath223 ( from left to right ) .",
    "the * fixedrion * model , with an assumed constant escape fraction and constant ionising output per unit halo mass , results in a steeply declining ionising emissivity with @xmath23 that mimics the steep halo mass function .",
    "in contrast , the * full * model has greater ionising output per @xmath23 for more massive halos , shifting the distribution towards higher halo mass .    the vertical dashed lines ( blue:*full * , cyan:*fixedrion * ) in figure  [ fig : hist ] represent the ionisation - weighted halo mass @xmath224 of all halos at the corresponding redshifts ( z=9.5,8.75,8.0 ) .",
    "@xmath224 thus represents the halo mass limit above ( or below ) which 50@xmath225 of the total ionizing photons is being emitted .",
    "we see that the @xmath224 is @xmath226 in our fiducial model whereas it is @xmath227 in * fixedrion * , with only a mild dependence on redshift .",
    "hence a model assuming a fixed ionising output per unit halo mass would predict that reionisation is dominated by extremely small galaxies near the hydrogen cooling limit , while a more realistic model for ionising photon output suggests that moderate - mass halos are responsible for reionisation .",
    "the latter scenario bodes well for future direct observations of galaxies driving reionisation , since galaxies in @xmath228 halos are likely to be detectable with _",
    "webb_.              we now examine how these physical variations impact the ionisation and 21-cm power spectra .",
    "the 21-cm power spectrum is the key observable that will be obtained in the forthcoming 21-cm eor observations .",
    "we compute the ionisation power spectrum as @xmath229 , analogous to the 21-cm power spectrum that was introduced in  [ 21cmpk ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pk1 ] and [ fig : pk2 ] , we compare the ionization fields and 21-cm power spectra of our fiducial model ( * full * ) to other models at different phases of the eor , respectively .",
    "we begin by comparing the 21-cm power spectra from our fiducial model ( * full * ) using the actual @xmath0 ( blue , solid ) , that requires @xmath230 to match the observations excluding sfr function measurements , with the renormalized @xmath0 ( orange , solid ) that requires @xmath231 to match the sfr functions measurements .",
    "we see , as expected , that the 21-cm power spectra with and without the renormalization to @xmath0 are identical , which confirms that the normalization of @xmath0 can be directly compensated by tuning our free parameter @xmath56 to higher or lower values as implied by observations .        as with the topology , the * full * and * nosubclump * models produce approximately similar power spectra of the ionisation fields and 21-cm signal through all eor phases .",
    "the differences in topology at moderate overdensities are sufficiently rare to not impact the overall power spectrum appreciably .",
    "this confirms that the sub - clumping effects have little significance to the eor 21-cm observables .    to further test the effects of sub - grid clumping",
    ", we also ran the * nosubclump * model with the same @xmath230 that is used in the * full * model , without matching to the same @xmath147 .",
    "we confirmed that the * nosubclump * model produces mostly identical results at the same neutral fraction for this slightly different @xmath56 .",
    "this confirms our finding , that the sub - clumping has no significant contribution to the eor process , is robust and independent of the way we used to do this comparison with the * full * model .",
    "as we have seen in studying the overall topology , the * full * and * nosubclump * models are very similar , while the * meanrrec * , * fixedrion * , and * classic * cases show similar evolutionary trends .",
    "not fully accounting for both non - linear ionisations and inhomogeneous recombinations tends to raise the ionisation field power spectrum on large scales relative to smaller scales , which results in a lower 21-cm power spectrum by a factor of a few .",
    "hence , for instance , compared to the old version of simfast21 during the early stages of the eor , our new code predicts almost @xmath232 as much power on large scales , and twice as much on small scales .",
    "the shape of the power spectra continue to be different at later stages , at which time the * full * model ends up with less large scale power but more small - scale power , as visually evident from the ionisation maps in figure  [ fig : maps ] .",
    "the physical reasons were discussed in  [ sec : maps ] , but basically arise because properly accounting for recombinations tends to slow the ionisation fronts when compared to * meanrrec * , while the * fixedrion * produces relatively more photons in low - density regions from low - mass halos which causes more large - scale bubbles .",
    "the * meanrrec * , * fixedrion * , and * classic * runs themselves show different evolutionary trends , with * fixedrion * increasing its ionisation and 21-cm power spectra faster than the other two .",
    "a comparison of the * meanrrec * and * classic * models in figure  [ fig : pk2 ] illustrates the significance of including a realistic treatment for the dependence of ionising efficiency on halo mass .",
    "both models effectively adopt a spatially - homogeneous recombination rate and are explicitly tuned to reproduce @xmath147 .",
    "however , the * meanrrec * ( like the * full * model ) adopts the ionising efficiency in figure  [ fig : nion ] and equation  , which concentrates ionisations in overdense regions .",
    "consequently , the * meanrrec * model predicts more large - scale power at all times than the * classic * model .",
    "this effect counteracts the suppression of large - scale power owing to spatially - inhomogeneous recombinations  @xcite .",
    "note that the adopted dependence in equation   is not arbitrary  it is taken from high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations that have been shown to be consistent with a range of observations of galaxies , absorbers , and reionisation  @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that it is an important factor to consider when predicting the 21-cm power spectrum .",
    "finally , we compare the predicted 21-cm power spectrum from our new version of simfast21 with those predictions from another semi - numerical simulation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their * full * model ) in figure  [ fig : com_pk ] .",
    "sm14 * full * simulation accounts for inhomogeneous recombinations but uses only homogeneous ionisations via a constant efficiency parameter ( @xmath35 , similar to our * classic * model ) .",
    "thus , the sm14 model shares similar physical assumptions to our * fixedrion * model . from figure",
    "[ fig : com_pk ] , it is clear to see that the shape of the 21-cm power spectrum predicted from * fixedrion * model is qualitatively similar to that of the sm14 model at all epochs , but there is a tendency for the * fixedrion * model to produce somewhat more power as the eor proceeds ; this is possibly related to different density field contribution from different z. however , it is quite clear that our * full * model predicts more power on small scales than models with homogeneous ionisations owing to non - linear ionisations .    to summarize , our new prescription for tracking non - linear ionisations and inhomogeneous recombinations results in predictions that differ significantly from models that do not include these effects , in particular yielding less power on scales of @xmath233  mpc , but more power on smaller scales .",
    "consistent with @xcite , we find that introducing inhomogeneous recombinations suppresses the power spectra of the ionisation field and 21-cm signal on large scales .",
    "we also find that introducing non - linear ionisations ( via @xmath0 ) boosts the small scale power spectra of the ionisation fields and the 21-cm signal .",
    "these results highlight the importance of carefully considering the details of ionising sources and recombinations in making accurate predictions for future 21 cm eor studies .",
    "we have predicted the 21-cm power spectrum during the epoch of reionisation from a new and improved version of our semi - numerical code simfast21 .",
    "this new version has been modified to incorporate halo mass - dependent ionisation rates ( @xmath0 ) and density - dependent recombination rates ( @xmath1 ) rates as a function of redshift .",
    "we parameterise @xmath0 and @xmath1 from small - volume , high - resolution radiative hydrodynamic simulation ( * 6/256-rt * ,  @xcite ) and a larger cosmological hydrodynamic simulation ( * 32/512 * ,  @xcite ) , that incoporate galaxy formation physics that has been well - constrained to match a wide range of observations down to lower redshifts .",
    "we have implemented these scalings into simfast21 to identify the ionised regions , as opposed to using a uniform ionising efficiency parameter per halo mass ( @xmath35 ) and no explicit recombinations as in the old version of simfast21 . using this ,",
    "we have studied the evolution of the neutral fraction and 21-cm power spectrum during reionisation .",
    "our main key findings are as follows :    * the mass - dependent ionisation rate @xmath0 scales super - linearly with halo mass as @xmath234 , which is consistent with the sfr-@xmath235 relation that previously found by @xcite . the recombination rate @xmath1 scale roughly as the density squared ,",
    "though with deviations at high overdensities .",
    "both display fairly tight relations that can be well - captured by analytic fitting formulae ( eq .  [ eq : nion ] and eq .",
    "[ rrec ] ) .",
    "* we tune our one free parameter , the ionising photon escape fraction , to be @xmath236 , in order to simultaneously match three key eor observables : ( i ) the optical depth to thomson scattering from @xcite ; ( ii ) the ionising emissivity measured at @xmath25 from @xcite ; ( iii ) the neutral fraction near end of reionisation from @xcite .",
    "this low @xmath56 , independent of halo mass and redshift , highlights the importance of running large - volume simulations to properly characterise the escape fraction @xmath56 and hence the ionising photon budget to complete reionisation .",
    "note that this @xmath56 represents the escape fraction averaged over all halos within a 0.375@xmath237 ( comoving ) cells , rather than @xmath56 from individual galaxies . to further concurrently match the sfr function measurements by @xcite , a renormalization of @xmath0 by a factor of 1.5",
    "is required , which then implies an escape fraction of 6% .",
    "this renormalization of @xmath0 and @xmath56 has no impact on the 21-cm power spectrum or other observables , since the total photon output remains the same .",
    "* during the early eor , the 21-cm power spectrum drops on large scales while staying constant on small scales , as small ionisation bubbles counteract the overall drop in cosmic density . at later stages ,",
    "the bubbles grow larger and the power on large scales recovers .",
    "after the global neutral fraction drops below @xmath238 ( at @xmath239 in our simulation ) , the 21-cm power spectrum drops rapidly .",
    "* reionisation occurs earlier in our simfast21 run than in the 6/256-rt simulation by @xmath240 , due to the small dynamic range of 6/256-rt that fails to capture the very earliest stages driven by the rarest overdensities , as well as large halos that are important during the later stages of the eor .",
    "these results are well - converged with respect to simulation volume up to scales @xmath241 of the box size . *",
    "introducing non - linearly mass - dependent ionisations ( @xmath0 ) : ( i ) increases the duration of reionisation ; ( ii ) boosts the 21-cm power at all scales by @xmath7 during the early eor ; ( iii ) boosts the small - scale 21-cm power by @xmath7 while lowering the large scale ( @xmath242 ) power during the late eor .",
    "qualitatively similar trends hold true for the ionisation field power spectra ( * full * versus * fixedrion * ) . * including spatially homogeneous recombinations using a globally - averaged recombination rate results in significantly more power on large scales and less power on small scales , since ionisation bubbles are able to grow to larger scales ( * full * versus * meanrrec * ) . * including clumping effects on scales below our cell size ( @xmath5 ) does not significantly affect the overall eor topology or 21-cm power spectrum ( * full * versus * nosubclump * ) , though it does result in a lower ionisation fraction at moderate overdensities ( @xmath243 ) . * in agreement with @xcite , we find that inhomogeneous recombinations ( @xmath1 ) matter a great deal ( * full * or * nosubclump * versus * meanrec * ) in suppressing the large - scale power spectrum , but accounting further for the detailed dependence of recombination rate on density at scales smaller than our cell size changes results minimally , and only at fairly high overdensities ( * full * versus * nosubclump * ) . *",
    "compared to the previous version of simfast21 ( * classic * ) , our new version produces more small - scale 21-cm power and less large - scale power .",
    "it is generally most similar to a model that assumes a globally - averaged recombination rate ( * meanrrec * ) or assumes a constant ionising output per unit halo mass ( * fixedrion * ) .",
    "* the power spectrum from the model of @xcite that account for recombinations but retain a fixed ionising output per unit halo mass is qualitatively similar to our * fixedrion * case , albeit with generally a lower amplitude . * our * full * model shows a significantly higher median halo mass for ionizing photon output of @xmath244 , as opposed to @xmath245 in the case of a constant ionising efficiency .",
    "this suggests that the majority of galaxies responsible for reionisation may be detectable with _",
    "webb _ ; we leave a more detailed examination of this for future work . *",
    "incorporating the non - linear mass - dependent ionisation causes reionisation to complete at a later epoch by @xmath246 ; this is a larger impact than that obtained by varying the recombination methodology .    taken together",
    ", our results suggest that the details of how one models ionisation and recombinations can impact the strength and shape of the 21-cm power spectrum up to a factor of @xmath247 . this is smaller than current observational uncertainties which are dominated by systematics , but might be significant for upcoming facilities such as hera and ska - low .",
    "this work represents a step forward in accurately modeling the physical processes occuring during reionisation on large scales . in the future we will use these models to make more detailed predictions for the observability of the 21-cm power spectrum at various observationally - accessible epochs and scales .",
    "we note that we have not considered any potential exotic sources of reionising photons . for instance , a recent paper by @xcite argues for quasars contributing significantly more than previously thought , indeed perhaps driving reionisation .",
    "such a population of accreting black holes would provide an additional source of ionising photons that would once again vary how reionisation proceeds .",
    "likewise , our radiation - hydrodynamic simulation did not properly track the contribution of mini - halos ( i.e. those below the h cooling limit ) to the ionising photon budget during reionisation , but there are no observational constraints that limit this .",
    "our simfast21-based modeling framework provides a way to explore these variations and their impact on observables such as the 21-cm power spectrum , in order to facilitate more optimal scientific interpretation of forthcoming 21-cm and other eor observations .",

    "<S> we explore the impact of incorporating physically motivated ionisation and recombination rates on the history and topology of cosmic reionisation and the resulting 21-cm power spectrum , by incorporating inputs from small - volume hydrodynamic simulations into our semi - numerical code , simfast21 , that evolves reionisation on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> we employ radiative hydrodynamic simulations to parameterize the ionisation rate @xmath0 and recombination rate @xmath1 as functions of halo mass , overdensity and redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 scales super - linearly with halo mass ( @xmath2 ) , in contrast to previous assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> implementing these scalings into simfast21 , we tune our one free parameter , the escape fraction @xmath3 , to simultaneously reproduce recent observations of the thomson optical depth , ionizing emissivity , and volume - averaged neutral fraction by the end of reionisation . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath4 averaged over our @xmath5 cells , independent of halo mass or redshift , increasing to 6% if we also constrain to match the observed @xmath6 star formation rate function . introducing super - linear @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> increases the duration of reionisation and boosts small - scale 21-cm power by @xmath7 at intermediate phases of reionisation , while inhomogeneous recombinations reduce ionised bubble sizes and suppress large - scale 21-cm power by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> gas clumping on sub - cell scales has a minimal effect on the 21 cm power . </S>",
    "<S> super - linear @xmath0 also significantly increases the median halo mass scale for ionising photon output to @xmath9 , making the majority of reionising sources more accessible to next - generation facilities . </S>",
    "<S> these results highlight the importance of accurately treating ionising sources and recombinations for modeling reionisation and its 21-cm power spectrum .    </S>",
