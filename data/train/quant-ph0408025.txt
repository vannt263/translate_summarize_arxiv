    "at the microscopic level , ordinary matter exhibits behaviour analogous to light waves .",
    "when wave - like electrons scatter off ions in crystalline materials , constructive interference between different trajectories can cause electric currents to flow .",
    "conversely , disorder in such crystals can hinder electrical conductivity , and for some energies the electrons become localized in space , thus preventing their free flow in the form of electrical currents .",
    "although such ideas have been known since the 1960s , it is only recently that physicists have begun to ask whether similar effects can result in the localization of light in a corresponding `` photonic crystal '' .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold . in the first part we outline the developments in photonic band gap ( pbg ) materials from the physics of photonic band gap formation to the fabrication and potential applications of photonic crystals . in the latter ,",
    "we specifically focus on the state of art 3-d structures exhibiting a full band gap in their electromagnetic field density of states , because as we believe , these are of great technological and fundamental interest . in the second part , we discuss the consequences for the interaction between an atom and the light field when the former is embedded in dielectric materials , mostly photonic crystals , which exhibit gaps in the density of states .",
    "we first review the standard treatment to describe the dynamics of spontaneous emission in free space and proceed by explaining the alterations needed to properly illustrate the dynamics of two - level systems embedded in a pbg material .",
    "a normal crystal is a periodic array of atoms which scatters and modifies the energy momentum relation of electrons , whereas a photonic crystal is an ordered inhomogeneous medium characterized by a spatially periodic dielectric constant , with lattice parameter comparable to the wavelength of the light @xcite . fig .",
    "[ john_inv_opal ] shows one such microstructure in which a complete bandgap at 1.5 microns has been observed .",
    "strictly speaking , such a structure has no allowed electro - magnetic ( em ) modes in the forbidden range of frequencies or in other words the _ density of states _ of the propagating photon modes is zero ( see figs .",
    "[ freespace_dos ] , [ pbg_dos ] ) .",
    "by contrast in free space ( a cavity of infinite volume ) the density of modes varies as @xmath0 and exhibits no gap . in a cavity of finite volume",
    "the density of states is substantially modified for frequencies close to the cavity cut off . below the cut off the cavity",
    "sustains no modes at all , and near above the cutoff , the density of states can be increased to the continuum case .",
    "( 5,5 )    ( 5,5 )    the vanishing of the density of propagating photon modes within a pbg means that , for the frequency range spanned by the gap , linear propagation of em waves is * forbidden in any direction * in the pbg material .",
    "thus , light incident on a pbg material with a frequency from the gap region will be backscattered from the material , independent of the angle of incidence .",
    "strong suppression of transmission with an associated peak in the reflectivity at the characteristic frequencies is then an experimental signature of a photonic band gap @xcite .    to give a further insight on the physics of light localization",
    "we will exploit the analogy between electron and light a bit further . as is well known an electron in a disordered solid is described by the following schrdinger equation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electron s effective mass and @xmath3 is a potential that varies randomly in space . for sufficiently negative energies @xmath4 , the electrons may get trapped in regions where the random potential is very deep .",
    "the rate at which electrons tunnel out of the deep potentials depends on the probability of finding nearby potential fluctuations into which the trapped electron can tunnel .",
    "this rate increases as the electron energy increases .    in the case of a monochromatic em wave of frequency @xmath5 propagating in an inhomogeneous but non - dissipative dielectric medium , the classical wave equation for the electric field is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polarization of the medium .",
    "assuming now propagation in a linear medium , this leads to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the slowing varying field amplitude . also the total dielectric",
    "constant has been separated into its average value @xmath10 and a spatially fluctuating part @xmath11 . in a lossless material",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath12 is everywhere real and positive and plays a role analogous to the random potential @xmath3 in the schrdinger equation .",
    "it scatters the em wave .",
    "comparing now the above two equations ( [ intro1 ] ) and ( [ intro2 ] ) we observe the following differences : firstly , the quantity @xmath13 which plays the role of an energy eigenvalue , is always positive , which precludes the possibility of elementary bound states of light in deep negative potential wells . +",
    "secondly the mode frequency @xmath5 multiplies the scattering potential @xmath11 and in contrast to an electronic system , where localization is increased by lowering the electron energy , lowering the photon energy leads to a complete disappearance of scattering .",
    "in addition , looking at the opposite high - frequency limit , geometric ray optics becomes valid and interference corrections to optical transport becomes less and less effective .",
    "these simply mean that in both cases the normal modes of the em field are extended , not localized .",
    "finally , the condition that @xmath14 everywhere translates into the requirement that the energy eigenvalue will always be greater than the effective potential @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , unlike the familiar picture of electronic localization , what we are really seeking is an intermediate frequency window within the positive energy continuum that lies at an energy higher than the highest of the potential barriers . for those frequencies",
    "the interference between the incident and the scattered em waves will be exactly destructive and this will allow no free propagating photon modes to exist in the structure .    in the following section , we quantify these ideas in a more rigorous way and present the procedure followed to find the allowed modes as a function of the frequency , the _ dispersion relation _ , in a simple 1-d periodic dielectric .",
    "the dielectric constant of any photonic crystal can be expressed as @xmath16 in this case we will assume that our structure exhibits periodicity in one dimension and is homogenous in the other two .",
    "more specifically @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the lattice constant and @xmath19 as discussed in the previous section , the propagation of a monochromatic em field in an inhomogeneous , non dissipative dielectric medium is governed by the following equation @xmath20 where @xmath9 is the field s ampitude . setting @xmath21 , the above equation reads ( @xmath22 , free charge is zero ) @xmath23 setting @xmath24 we get @xmath25 where the potential @xmath26 is basically a sequence of  potential barriers \" of width @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ periodic ] ) .",
    "the objective is to solve eq .",
    "( [ propag_apb ] ) for the potential @xmath26    restricting ourselves to a unit cell of the crystal , the solution can be expressed as follows @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . according to the floquet theorem",
    ", @xmath31 should obey the following equation @xmath32 and the derivative @xmath33 in addition the boundary conditions are that both @xmath31 and @xmath34 should be continuous at @xmath35 . applying all these conditions ,",
    "we calculate the expansion coefficients and also the following transcendental equation describing the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 which for @xmath38 can be inverted analytically providing the _ dispersion relation _ for the 1d crystal , @xmath39 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this dispersion relation leads to gaps at @xmath40 for odd integer values of @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ periodic_disp ] ) .",
    "the lowest gap is centered at the frequency @xmath42 which for the case @xmath38 equals @xmath43 ( case shown fig . [ periodic ] ) .    in the more general case of a realistic 3-d photonic crystal ,",
    "the usual approach is using the bloch - floquet theorem to expand both the field amplitude and the dielectric constant in plane waves whose wavevectors are reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the polarization vector and @xmath46 are reciprocal lattice vectors . using this expansion in eq .",
    "( [ intro2 ] ) , the problem is reduced to the solution of a system of linear equations on @xmath47 the solution of which provides the allowed mode frequencies for a given crystal ( fig .",
    "[ opal_bands ] ) .",
    "we should note here that for more complicated 3-d structures the solution of the corresponding eigenvalue equation proves to be cumbersome and highly efficient computational techniques are usually required , see for example refs.@xcite .      in order to realize a 3-d structure with a full band gap for the propagation of light for some specific frequencies , we need not only to show that a specific geometry could in principle exhibit a band gap but also that the specific micro - structure is amenable to microfabrication in the lab @xcite . to illustrate the methods followed by various groups in this field we will start with the simplest case , the traditional multilayer film .",
    "the latter is the simplest dielectric structure where one can observe inhibition of the linear propagation of a em wave .",
    "it is relatively easy to construct by assembling together dielectric layers with alternating high and low refractive indexes .    to go further than that ,",
    "i.e. to create a band gap in the propagation of an em wave in two dimensions , we need something more sophisticated than simply contrast in the index of refraction .",
    "we need to find a specific geometry that will provide a full band gap for a range of frequencies in two dimensions . for this",
    "we need to keep in mind that the em field consists of two type of modes . the transverse - electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) ones . to achieve a complete band gap for all polarizations ,",
    "the corresponding bands should not only exist but also overlap .",
    "tm band gaps are favored in a lattice of isolated high index regions as in an array of dielectric columns in air .",
    "in contrast , te band gaps are favored in the _ inverse _ structure as in an array of air columns ( veins ) drilled in a dielectric substrate .",
    "therefore to achieve a full band gap , we need somehow to reconcile these seemingly contradictory conditions @xcite . a structure satisfying this , is a triangular lattice of low index columns ( air ) inside a high index medium ( silicon ) , see fig .",
    "[ 2d_triangular_exper ] .",
    "more specifically for the case where the radius of the columns is large enough , the spots between the columns behave like localized regions of high refractive index material and thus the above requirement should be satisfied .",
    "it was predicted that for @xmath48 for the ratio between the radius of the air columns to the lattice constant , a complete photonic band gap should form exhibiting a gap - midgap frequency ratio of about 19@xmath49 .",
    "the experimental verification was provided by gruning et el .",
    "@xcite , who constructed the crystal using an electrochemical technique to etch out columns in a silicon substrate .",
    "their subsequent measurements verified a band gap at @xmath50 . also at the same year krauss et al .",
    "constructed 2d polarization - sensitive photonic band - gaps with wavelengths in the range 800 - 900 nm @xcite .",
    "however , to achieve complete inhibition of light in all directions , we need a 3d structure which exhibits periodicity in all three directions . out of the plethora of different geometries ,",
    "the one that was found , in theory first @xcite and experimentally later @xcite to support a full 3-d band gap is the _ diamond _ lattice .",
    "the structure initially suggested by the iowa group consists of either dielectric spheres in air or air spheres embedded in a dielectric medium .",
    "yablonovitch managed to implement the latter by mechanically drilling cylindrical holes through a dielectric block ( with @xmath51 ) .",
    "the points where his tunnels coincided formed a diamond - like structure ( see fig .",
    "[ diammond ] ) . in spite of the apparent simplicity and initial success of the method in demonstrating the existence of a band gap in the microwave region , the application of the same method for optical waves proved to be of great difficulty . in this case , the spheres and consequently the @xmath52 had to be in the micrometer region ! we remind here that in order for the tm and te gaps to overlap , both constituent materials ( air and dielectric ) have to be topologically interconnected and also a large contrast ( at least 3 ) between the two is essential .",
    "these constraints limited the use of microengineering fabrication techniques ( electron beam and x - ray lithography @xcite which proved to be very successful in longer wavelengths . ) .",
    "the problem in this case was that only a few unit cells could be reliably produced . ]",
    "a different approach was the layer stacking technique proposed by ho _",
    "@xcite ( see fig . [ woodpiles ] ) and implemented by lin _",
    "@xcite where a gap at 1.5 microns was reported and the seven layer crystal exhibited 1@xmath49 transmission ( it was believed to drop to 0.1 @xmath49 with ten layers ) .",

    "they reported 99.9 % attenuation between 6 and 9 @xmath53 using eight layers .",
    "we note here that both methods are promising for any large scale technological application ( see next section ) as they are characterized by low cost and high reliability . ) .",
    "they predict the opening of a full 3-d band gap . ]    to overcome the difficulties of 3-d sub - micron engineering it has also been proposed to utilize systems that tend to self assemble themselves into various geometries .",
    "the most promising one proved to be colloidal crystals and artificial opals .",
    "colloidal particles have been synthesized by materials such as latex and @xmath54 in the range of a few nanometres to a few hundred micrometers .",
    "a suspension of colloidal microspheres , with a typical concentration of @xmath55 particles/@xmath56 , can residue under gravity into a cubic - closed - packed structure with size of the order of 1 cm .    in spite of the advantage of producing inherently 3-d structures",
    "@xcite compared to the 2-d ones using lithographic techniques , it appears to be extremely difficult to achieve the required refractive index contrast and interconnectedness for a full 3-d band - gap to open . on the other hand , if they are used as templates to fabricate @xmath57 opals ( fig [ john_inv_opal ] ) , i.e. , cubic - closed - packed lattices of air _ bubbles _ on a dielectric matrix ( silicon or gaas ) @xcite , near visible photonic band gaps with gap to mid - gap frequency ratio of about 10@xmath49 were predicted ( see fig .",
    "[ opal_bands ] ) .",
    "we note here that the void regions that are left behind after the etching of the original template ( swiss cheese structure ) will allow the injection of atoms or dye molecules thus making quantum optical type of experiments possible . in spite of the initial success of the inverted opals in providing rather large band gaps in infrared region , problems of gap instability to disorder effects",
    "may prove to be difficult to overcome . a solution to this",
    "was recently proposed by s.johns group in university of toronto @xcite .",
    "they proposed an alternative photonic crystal architecture consisting of square spiral posts in a tetragonal lattice ( fig .",
    "[ spirals ] ) .",
    "it seems that this structure could exhibit a quite large and robust 3d pbg occurring between the fourth and fifth em bands and is also amenable to large - scale microfabrication using glancing angle deposition ( glad ) techniques .",
    "spiral post lattices with microscale features have previously been synthesized using the glad method . in this technique ,",
    "complex 3d structures can be fabricated by combining oblique vapor deposition and precisely controlled motion of a two - dimensionally patterned substrate .",
    "in addition , their square spiral posts can serve as templates for growing pbg materials from an even larger range of materials . in this case",
    ", a high refractive index material may be infiltrated to fill the void regions between the posts , with the posts subsequently removed by some selective etching process , leaving behind an  inverted structure . \"",
    "their calculations have shown that the new inverted structure could exhibit an even bigger band gap which for the case that the initial structure is infiltrated by silicon gaps , could be of the order of 27@xmath49 .",
    "one of the most immediate applications of photonic crystals was to be in optoelectronic devices where unwanted spontaneous emission affected their performance .",
    "on the left of fig .",
    "[ both_gaps ] we show the electron dispersion relation for a direct gap semiconductor .",
    "assuming that is embedded in a photonic crystal ( whose photonic dispersion relation is shown on the right of the same graph ) it is easy to see that if the pbg overlaps the electronic band edge then the electron - hole recombination rate could be inhibited .",
    "that is simply because the potentially emitted photon will have no place to go ! in a semiconductor laser",
    "this would lead to near unity efficiency into the lasing mode .",
    "this theoretical idea was recently implemented @xcite in the 2-d band edge micro - laser in which lasing occurs preferentially at the 2-d photonic band edge even though the emission from the active region has a broad frequency distribution ( fig .",
    "[ 2d - lasers ] ) .    along the same lines ,",
    "light extraction from leds would be more efficient .",
    "the main problem there is that only the light emitted in a narrow angle where n is the index of refraction for the emitting material . for gaas ,",
    "n=3.5 and the efficiency is approximately 5 @xmath49 . ] manages to escape and the rest is usually trapped within the film and is either absorbed or emerges from the edge of the device .",
    "there are several ways to partially overcome this , for example using photon recycling , rough surface , e.t.c . ,",
    "which could increase the efficiency to 30@xmath49 but none of them actually alters directly the spontaneous emission properties of the device . if a 2-d photonic crystal pattern in the form of a triangular lattice of air holes is introduced into the semiconductor @xcite , extraction efficiency of the order of @xmath58 is expected .",
    "this is simply due to the large band gap that will appear for in plane propagation forcing the photons to come out of the slab in the vertical directions .",
    "in addition , unlike the planar microcavity , the efficiency is enhanced over a wide range of frequencies and as no resonance or photon recycling is needed , the photon lifetime is shorter .",
    "the latter of course leads to a reduction of the absorption losses and an increase of the modulation speed of the led .",
    "we proceed by describing the potential applications of the presence of _ defect modes _ in a photonic crystal .",
    "it was shown that by adding or removing a piece of dielectric material the periodicity of the lattice is locally altered and this can lead to the appearance of highly localized modes of light in an otherwise mode free surrounding .",
    "in particular , removing a small amount of high index material from one unit cell ( air defect ) , leads to the occurrence of a localized mode just above the top of the lower band in analogy to the acceptor modes in semiconductors . on the other hand adding a small amount of high index material to a single unit cell ( dielectric defect )",
    "forces a single localized mode to split off from the upper band edge as in semiconductor donor modes .",
    "the former case - an air defect - is basically a high - q microcavity with tunable frequency .",
    "all types of applications that involve high - q optical microcavities could thus implemented .",
    "the main advantage over usual high - q superconducting metallic cavities is the operation on higher frequencies without almost any losses .",
    "various devices such as frequency filters , atom masers , zero - threshold lasers should be more efficient ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d - lasers]b ) .",
    "also experiments involving single atom - photon interaction in the strong coupling regime is important should be easier realizable .    in a similar way to the introduction of points defects",
    ", someone can also create _ line defects _ in an otherwise perfect structure .",
    "such defects could be used as lossless waveguides @xcite where light could be guided around sharp corners with no reflection or scattering losses(see fig .",
    "[ waveguiding ] ) . also highly efficient fibers confining light within a hollow core ( a large air hole ) in a silica - air photonic crystal fiber has been demonstrated@xcite .",
    "last but not least , we mention the idea of creating tunable pbgs by the infiltration of inverted opal or spiral structures with some low index of refraction liquid crystal",
    ". the potential of controlling the direction of the nematic liquid crystal molecules through an external electric field , could alter the optical properties of the whole structure and simply provide external control over the width of a full 3-d gap @xcite .",
    "the resulting tunability of spontaneous emission , waveguiding effects , and light localization may considerably enhance the technological value of a composite liquid crystal pbg material over and above that of either a bulk liquid crystal or a conventional pbg material by itself",
    ". a tunable optical microchip which routes light from a set of optical fibers and could be used as part of greater optical circuit is shown in fig .",
    "[ chip ] .",
    "we conclude this part by noting that the intense interest in the field of photonic crystals in recent years has not solely been due the above described  optical circuit \" type of applications , where light was treated as a classical field .",
    "a lot of research has also been towards the understanding of the light - matter interactions within a photonic crystal at the quantum level .",
    "several novel phenomena , such as , for example , the inhibition of spontaneous emission and the creation of `` atom - photon '' bound states @xcite , and also the existence of transparency near a photonic band edge @xcite were found in these studies .",
    "describing the effect of inhibition of spontaneous emission and the creation of `` atom - photon '' bound states will be the task of the section to follow .",
    "it was not until the 1980 s @xcite before it was established that spontaneous emission is not an intrinsic property of matter over which we have no control on @xcite but a process greatly dependent on the nature of the surrounding environment .",
    "we should note here that it was actually 1946 when an effectively overlooked paper by purcell @xcite already had suggested that the spontaneous emission rate of radiating dipoles can be tailored by using a cavity to modify the dipole - field coupling and the density of the available photon modes .",
    "if the modal density in the vicinity of the frequency of interest is greater than that of free space , then spontaneous emission will be enhanced , if it is less , it will be inhibited this is the _",
    "purcell effect_. technological developments , in the form of high quality and finesse cavities , extended this to what we know today as cavity qed @xcite .",
    "one of the most characteristic concepts that was introduced at the time was the vacuum rabi oscillations . to illustrate this ,",
    "assume you have an atom , excited to some rydberg state , placed inside a microwave cavity of high quality factor of the order of @xmath55 and mode spacing larger than the mode width .",
    "assuming that the frequency of the transition from the initial rydberg state to the nearest one matches one of the cavity modes , then spontaneous emission is greatly enhanced , whereas it is severely inhibited when the atomic transition is detuned from all cavity modes by an amount larger than the mode width . in the case of exact resonance ,",
    "the spontaneously emitted photon is reabsorbed by the atom then reemitted again and so on , leading to an oscillatory exchange of energy between the atom and the cavity radiation field .",
    "the operation of the micromaser is based on this effect where a constant exchange of coherent microwave photons between the mirrors of a microwave cavity and rydberg atoms flying through @xcite .    from the implementation point of view",
    ", the technological expertise required to built high - q cavities has only recently moved from the microwave to the optical or near optical regime allowing for the possibility of similar research in the optical range @xcite .",
    "the great obstacle in localizing light in cavities is related with the shape of cavity modes . basically , there are always tails of the usual lorenzian distribution of the cavity lineshape that extend to infinity allowing an excited atom located in the cavity to eventually decay to the ground state .",
    "extensive research in dielectric structures of the form described in the previous section showed that it was possible to fabricate situations where the modal density of the electromagnetic field exhibited gaps for a range of frequencies .",
    "as a qualitative approximation we would say that an excited atom tuned with the gap should never decay as there are no modes for its photon to exist . initially lead by john and collaborators and then quickly spreading to many groups throughout the word , an enormous amount of work has been produced dealing with questions usually asked in quantum optics , now extrapolated to pbgs , at least at their theoretical properties under somewhat idealized situations using generalized density of modes for the pbg material @xcite or under more involved situations where the local density of modes is used for the description of the pbg material @xcite . the purpose of the sections to follow is to review some of the tools used in the above studies and more specifically in describing the dynamics of spontaneous emission . the first part describes the case where the atoms interact with the free space vacuum and the second with structured continuum of a photonic crystal .",

    "it is easy to see using ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ a+- ] ) that @xmath133 .",
    "this translates to the fact the corresponding dressed state at the frequency @xmath134 is the photon - atom bound dressed state with no - decay .",
    "a photon emitted by the atom in this state will tunnel for a length scale of a few lattice constants before being reflected back and re - absorbed by the atom .",
    "the other dressed state on the contrary is pushed outside the gap , where the density of photon states is not zero and eventually will be responsible for the part of the initial excitation that will eventually decay ( see fig .",
    "[ dressed_in_gap ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ pop_isotropic ] we show the atomic population as a function of time for various detunings from the band edge frequency .",
    "as was expected for atomic transitions well inside the gap ( @xmath135 ) , the atom remains in the excited state for ever . in this case the second term in eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) vanishes which means that no true atomic level splitting is present in this case and the oscillations in the dynamics are caused by the interference with a `` quasidressed '' state originating from the branch point term .",
    "as @xmath136 moves from negative to positive , the other component , located at @xmath134 becomes important and eventually for @xmath137 is the major one forcing the atom to complete decay in the usual exponential manner .",
    "we note here that this photon - atom bound state is present even when the atomic frequency @xmath138 is placed outside the gap where the density of states is not equal to zero and that is because of the special singular behaviour around of the isotropic model there . for  smoother \" cases such as smoothed models for the pbg density of modes or a lorenzian density of modes both",
    "the corresponding dressed states occur at complex frequencies which for long times leads to complete decay of the population to the ground state .",
    "in this introductory review article we have discussed phenomena in photonic crystals with emphasis on the inhibition of spontaneous emission of atoms in such materials .",
    "we started by describing the physics behind photonic band gap formation by making a parallel with the known phenomenon of electron localization in solids and continued by presenting a simple model of a _ band structure _ calculation .",
    "we briefly presented the state of the art methods in fabricating photonic band gap materials .",
    "some of the exciting applications in the field of optoelectronics were illustrated followed by noting the basically theoretical but really exciting possibility of _ circuits of light _ in all an optical computing device . in the second part we moved to the quantum regime , i.e. , the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field inside a photonic crystal with small atomic systems .",
    "we discussed the way of treating the spontaneous emission of a two - level atom in free space using the weisskopf - wigner theory .",
    "we concluded this introductory review by presenting in detail the modification in the spontaneous emission of the same two - level atom when embedded in a photonic crystal of a specific type .",
    "new phenomena arising by the localization of light as the complete _ inhibition _ of the spontaneous decay , _ atom - photon bound state _ and _ population trapping _ in a two - level atom were derived and discussed .",
