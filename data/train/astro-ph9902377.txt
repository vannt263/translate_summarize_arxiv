    "according to the so - called unified model ( antonucci 1993 ) the same engine is at work in all active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the differences between type 1 and type 2 agns are ascribed solely to orientation effects : our line of sight to the nucleus may ( type 2 ) or may not ( type 1 ) be obstructed by optically thick material , perhaps distributed in a toroidal geometry .",
    "the knowledge of the amount of obscuring gas in seyfert galaxies is important to understand the physical properties and the nature of the putative torus , but is also relevant to other agn  related issues , such as the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "indeed , the distribution of the absorbing n@xmath2 is a key ingredient in background synthesis models ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "when the photoelectric absorption cutoff is observed in the hard x - ray spectrum of a given source , the column density of the obscuring gas is easily measured , at least in principle . in the spectral analysis of these sources",
    "an extra emission at low energies is often present , the so - called `` soft excess '' ( ascribed either to scattered radiation or to diffuse thermal emission ) , which is fitted with a separate model component .",
    "the n@xmath2 which is derived from the fit is the one that obscures the central emission of the agn , while other opacities affecting the reflected or diffuse radiation are not relevant in the present context .",
    "when instead only a reflected component is visible , and the direct component is completely suppressed in the observed spectral range , one can deduce only a lower limit for n@xmath2 , which depends on the maximum energy for which measurements are available ( for a detailed discussion see maiolino et al .",
    "1998a , hereafter m98 ) .",
    "many seyfert 2s ( hereafter sy2s ) were observed in the past by various x - ray satellites such as einstein , ginga and , more recently , asca , rosat , and bepposax .",
    "the main limitation of previous studies on the n@xmath2 distribution of sy2s was the strong bias in favor of x - ray bright sources , which tend to be the least absorbed ones .",
    "however , recent observations have probed x - ray weaker sy2s , partly removing the selection against heavily obscured objects ( salvati et al .",
    "1997 , awaki et al .",
    "1997 , m98 , risaliti et al .",
    "several works have tackled the issue of the n@xmath2 distribution by taking advantage of these new data .",
    "m98 compare the n@xmath2 distribution of past surveys with that obtained from the bepposax survey of an [ oiii]selected sy2 sample , and emphasize the bias against heavily absorbed objects in the former .",
    "bassani et al . ( 1999 , hereafter b99 ) present the n@xmath2 distribution of the whole sample of sy2s for which hard x - ray data are available , and of an optically selected subsample .",
    "all of these works are still affected by selection effects or by incompleteness problems ; they are nonetheless useful to monitor how the selection criteria can affect the shape of the n@xmath2 distribution .    here",
    "we start from an optical sample of seyfert 2 galaxies which is the best available one in terms of biases related to absorption . from it",
    "we extract a nuclear  flux limited subsample for which almost complete hard x - ray information exists , either published , or produced by us from archival data .",
    "the absorbing column density distribution is derived from this `` optimal '' subsample . in section 2",
    "we describe the selection criteria of the subsample , and discuss the correction of residual biases and incompleteness effects . in section 3",
    "we present the n@xmath2 distribution which is obtained , and briefly analyze the physical consequences of our results .",
    "in this paper with the name `` seyfert 2 '' we refer to sources classified as type 1.8 , 1.9 , and 2 in optical catalogs .",
    "our `` parent '' sample of seyfert 2 galaxies is that of maiolino & rieke ( 1995 , hereafter mr ) , completed with ngc 1808 .",
    "we also consider 18 new seyferts found by ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which would have been included in mr if they had been discovered earlier .",
    "these 18 additional sources are useful in order to test mr in terms of completeness and residual biases , as will become clear in the following ; however , none of them will be included in the final subsample ( because of the selection criteria of the latter ) , and we do not have to tackle problems related to possible dishomogeneities between mr and ho et al .",
    "the mr seyferts are identified spectroscopically within the revised shapley ames catalog of galaxies ( rsa , sandage & tammann 1987 ) , which is limited in the b magnitude of the host galaxy ( b@xmath3 mag ) .",
    "( 1997 ) select their seyfert galaxies with the same criterion , but they cut the rsa to a lower limiting magnitude ( b@xmath4 mag ) and require that @xmath5 ; on the other hand , they generally have spectra with higher signal - to - noise . hard",
    "x - ray spectra are available for 43 of the mr sy2s and for 1 out of the 18 additional sources of ho et al .",
    "the naive approach of taking the n@xmath2 distribution of these 44 objects can not be adopted , however , because of possible residual biases and incompleteness problems .",
    "we discuss these issues in the following .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a large fraction of the sy2s with hard x - ray spectra were observed because they were known to be bright according to all  sky x - ray surveys , and very likely this selection criterion introduced a bias in favor of little absorbed objects ( see m98 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "a sy2s ( sub)sample suitable for determining a more reliable distribution of n@xmath2 should be selected according to criteria independent of absorption effects .",
    "the optimal sample should be limited in the _ intrinsic flux _ ( i.e. before absorption ) of the active nucleus .",
    "a good indicator of the intrinsic agn flux is the intensity of the [ oiii ] @xmath6    emission line that is produced in the narrow line region ( nlr ) on the 100pc scale and , therefore , is little affected by the nuclear obscuration on the pc scale .",
    "however , mr showed that the host galaxy gaseous disk might obscure part of the nlr ( see also di serego aligheri et al .",
    "1997 and he s et al .",
    "1993 ) , and it is important to correct the [ oiii ] flux for large scale absorption . the magnitude of the correction can be derived from the ( narrow line ) balmer decrement . according to the unified model ,",
    "the ratio between the _ observed _ and the _ intrinsic _ x - ray luminosity of a seyfert nucleus is a measure of the absorbing n@xmath2 along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , if the ( extinction corrected ) [ oiii ] luminosity is proportional to the intrinsic luminosity , then an estimate of n@xmath2 is provided by the ratio between the observed x - ray flux and the corrected [ oiii ] flux .",
    "the expected relation was confirmed and calibrated by a recent statistical study on a large sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ( b99 ) .    in table 1",
    "we report the mr sample in order of decreasing absorption  corrected [ oiii ] flux , while in table 2 we report the 18 additional sources from the ho et al . sample .",
    "all data are taken from the literature , with the exception of 5 objects ( ngc 4565 , ngc 5005 , ic 2560 , ngc 5347 , and ic 5135 ) , which have been observed but whose hard x - ray data have not been published yet . for these sources , we have retrieved and analyzed the data from the asca public archive . the results of our analysis are briefly summarized in the appendix .",
    "ngc 4945 and ic 2560 do not have [ oiii ] data , but their [ oiii ] flux is inferred to be quite high based on their x - ray flux ( see the appendix for more details ) . as discussed above , most of the sources in table 1 were selected for hard x - ray observation because they were found bright in previous all  sky x - ray surveys",
    ". only 13 of them were selected because of their strong [ oiii ] flux ( @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ) without a previous x - ray survey detection ( salvati et al .",
    "1997 , m98 , risaliti et al . 1999 ,",
    "awaki et al .",
    "the n@xmath2 distribution of the latter set is strongly biased towards high values of n@xmath2 ( m98 ) , as expected , since their non  detection in x - ray surveys , and their high intrinsic flux implied by the [ oiii ] can be reconciled only by a strong pc  scale absorption .",
    "we now note that table 1 has 9 sources with `` high '' [ oiii ] flux ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath9 @xmath8 ) and with no hard x - ray data , or with a signal - to - noise not good enough to provide spectroscopic information is unknown ( see b99 for more details ) . ] .",
    "to all these 9 sources one can apply the same line of reasoning of the 13 [ oiii]selected sources mentioned above , and one can plausibly assume that both sets have the same distribution of column densities .",
    "the 18 additional sources discovered in the rsa by ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have systematically low [ oiii ] fluxes ( f@xmath11 } = 33\\times 10^{-14}$ ] erg s@xmath9 @xmath8 for the brightest one , the others have f@xmath11 } < 20\\times 10^{-14}$ ] erg @xmath8s@xmath9 ) : they are intrinsically weak , in accordance with their being unnoticed until recently in the optical .",
    "these new additions to the original mr sample are evidence that the latter is incomplete at low [ oiii ] fluxes , and the incompleteness could entail a bias in favor of low absorption in low luminosity objects .",
    "this would be analogous to the bias that affected older optically selected seyfert samples which indeed , as shown by mr , avoided low luminosity , highly obscured agns .",
    "the same bias might show up here , since these faint nuclei are in any case difficult to detect and a substantial absorption could take them below the detection limit .",
    "hints of this effect at low fluxes come from the comparison of the n@xmath2 values of the f@xmath11 } > 40 \\times 10^{-14}$ ] erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 subsample with the one having @xmath12 erg @xmath8 s@xmath13 f@xmath11 }   < 40 \\times 10^{-14}$ ] erg @xmath8s@xmath9 ( there are no x - ray data for sources with f@xmath11 } < 3 \\times 10^{-14}$ ] erg @xmath8s@xmath9 ; here , only in order to compare high and low flux sources , we merge together tabs . 1 and 2 ) . out of the 45 brightest sy2s only 2 objects ( i.e. 5% ) have n@xmath14 @xmath8 , while among the next fainter 27 at least 6 ( i.e. 22% ) have such a low n@xmath2 . assuming that the true distribution is given by the first set",
    ", there is already a 2 @xmath15 excess of low absorption objects in the second set , notwithstanding the large incompleteness of its hard x - ray data .",
    "alternately , the differences between the two n@xmath2 distributions could arise because of a real physical dependence of the column density on the intrinsic luminosity of the source . in order to explore this hypothesis",
    ", we looked for a correlation between n@xmath2 and [ oiii ] luminosity among the 45 strongest [ oiii ] sources , and found none ( upper panel of fig .",
    "the same result ( i.e. no correlation ) is found by comparing the n@xmath2 distribution directly with the absorption corrected x - ray ( 210 kev ) luminosity , as shown in the lower panel of fig . 1 .",
    "further evidence for a bias affecting the [ oiii]faint nuclei comes from the axial ratios ( a / b ) of the host galaxies ( fig .",
    "2 ) : the faintest [ oiii ] sources are seen preferentially face  on , while the brightest ones have an isotropic distribution for a / b @xmath16 0.2 ( axial ratios lower than 0.2 are difficult to find because of the galactic disk thickness ) .",
    "the reason is probably that faint agns are hardly detected if the host galaxy is edge  on , since then the nlr emission is partially absorbed .",
    "this result further supports the idea that the subsample of faint objects is biased in terms of obscuration . to prevent our results from being affected by the same bias , we excluded from our study all the objects with an [ oiii ] flux less than 40 @xmath17 erg @xmath8s@xmath9 .",
    "this selection criterion automatically excludes all the additional sources from the ho et al .",
    "sample ; this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 where the [ oiii ] flux distribution is shown .    with the sample selection",
    "discussed above , we do not use all the available data ( 8 of the ignored objects have x - ray spectra : 18% of the total ) , but we can assume that the remaining 45 objects constitute the least biased subsample now available .",
    "a final concern regards the optical classification of some of the objects in tab .",
    "1 , that might be different depending on the reference in the literature , and might pose into question whether these objects should be included or not . some of the discrepant classifications are simply a matter of sensitivity of the optical spectra , and affect mostly faint objects , i.e. those with low [ oiii ] fluxes , that we have excluded anyway . in some intermediate type seyferts ( 1.81.9 )",
    "the slit width plays a role : narrower slits tend to miss a fraction of the nlr thus turning some of the nearby sy1.8s into sy1.5s ; conversely , missing the nucleus with the slit could cause the opposite error . to minimize this problem we adopted the classification obtained with the widest slit , as long as the signal - to - noise of the spectra were comparable .",
    "again , most of these intermediate seyferts with discrepant classification are in the low[oiii ] part of tab .",
    "1 that we have excluded . only two of them are in the high[oiii ] subsample , namely ngc 1275 and ngc 3031 ( classified as sy1.5s by ho et al . ) : these two objects have low n@xmath2 , therefore their exclusion would further shift the n@xmath2 distribution towards high values .",
    "variability can also play a role : in objects known to be variable ( e.g. ngc 2992 ) we adopted the classification and the n@xmath2 measurement in the high state . finally , a few objects have line ratios at the borderline with liners , whose relationship with seyfert nuclei is still matter of debate .",
    "only one object of this category is present in the high[oiii ] subsample , namely ngc 5005 .",
    "summarizing , uncertainties in the optical classification do not affect significantly our results thanks to our [ oiii]based selection criterion : at most 3 out of the 45 objects in the final subsample might be misclassified .",
    "our final subsample is composed of 45 sources : we have direct n@xmath2 measurements for 36 of them , while for the remaining 9 we can make reasonable assumptions based on their `` detection history '' in optical and x  rays ( see previous section ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig . 4 , and tabulated in table  3 ; the number in brackets corresponds to objects for which only a lower limit on n@xmath2 is available .",
    "quoted errors are 1  @xmath15 , and they are estimated by means of a monte carlo simulation in two steps : first , 9 n@xmath2 values are extracted at random according to the distribution of the 13 [ oiii]selected sources mentioned in sect .  2 ; these are added to the 36 known values in order to obtain a 45entry distribution .",
    "then , 45 n@xmath2 values are extracted at random according to the latter distribution .",
    "the procedure is repeated many times and the 1@xmath15 interval for each bin is measured .    in the hypothesis that the [ oiii ] flux is a good indicator of the agn intrinsic luminosity , and that n@xmath2 is independent of luminosity , every [ oiii ] selected subsample should provide the same n@xmath2 distribution .",
    "we can therefore check our assumptions about the 9 objects not observed in the x rays by repeating our analysis on a smaller set , composed only by the first 30 objects in tab .",
    "1 with available hard x - ray data ( 3 sources without such data are interspersed among them , and are ignored ) . the new n@xmath2 distribution is in agreement , within the errors , with the one plotted in fig .",
    "4 . obviously the relative errors are higher , the statistics being lower , but the check confirms that our treatment of the 9 non - observed sources does not introduce new biases .",
    "the shape of the distribution is quite different from what was assumed up to now : we obtain that @xmath18 of all sy2s are heavily obscured ( n@xmath19 @xmath8 ) and about half are compton thick ( n@xmath20 @xmath8 ) .",
    "the main uncertainty still remaining is about the fraction of completely opaque sources ( n@xmath21 @xmath8 ) with respect to `` translucent '' objects with @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath8 . in both cases",
    "the spectra are reflection dominated in the 210 kev band , and can not be distinguished by asca or other medium x - ray satellites . the only way of identifying column densities in the interval @xmath22",
    "@xmath23 @xmath8 is by means of solid scintillating detectors sensitive around 30  kev , like the pds instrument on board bepposax .    the shaded bar in fig .",
    "4 indicates sources with reflection dominated spectra in the 210 kev spectral range , but not observed at higher energies , i.e. objects for which only a lower limit of 10@xmath24 @xmath8 can be set to the absorbing column density . placing them in the @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath8 bin is a conservative assumption , which minimizes the amount of absorption required ; also , a substantial population in this bin is needed for the synthesis of the x - ray background ( gilli et al .",
    "however , if we consider the objects with sensitive observations in the 10200 kev range ( mostly by bepposax ) , an unexpected low number of sources with @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath8 comes out . up to now , 10 seyfert 2s with n@xmath20 @xmath8 were observed : only 2 of them have also n@xmath25 @xmath8 , 7 have n@xmath21 @xmath8 , while for the remaining one the estimate is controversial .",
    "future observations , to be performed by means of bepposax and the next japanese x - ray satellite astro ",
    "e , will make clear whether the present lack is due to statistical fluctuations or not .",
    "as outlined previously , our sample of 45 sources is composed by type 1.8 , 1.9 and 2 seyfert galaxies , i.e. sources that generally show indications of cold absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "nevertheless , it can be interesting to consider the n@xmath2 distribution of type 2 and type 1.81.9 objects separately , as done in fig .",
    "the average column density of the intermediate seyferts is clearly much lower than that of the `` strict '' sy2s , in agreement with the expectations of the model proposed by maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) .",
    "the results reported here have several astrophysical implications .",
    "present models of the cosmic x - ray background ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli et al .",
    "1999a ) are able to reproduce the observations at energies between 2 kev and 100 kev in terms of the contribution of the agns ( both type 1 and type 2 ) . among the many parameters of such models ( agn luminosity function and evolution , type  1 to type  2 ratio , components of the mean spectrum ) only the ones concerning the n@xmath2 distribution",
    "were not constrained by any direct measurement until now .",
    "the inclusion of our results on the n@xmath2 distribution in the synthesis codes , together with new determinations of the x - ray luminosity function and evolution of type  1 agns ( miyaji et al .",
    "1999 ) , leads to very important conclusions on the properties of the contributors to the hard x - ray background and , specifically , on the existence of high luminosity type  2 agns ( qso2s ) , the evolution with redshift of the type  1 to type 2  ratio , and the consistency with the hard x - ray counts which are now becoming available ( giommi et al .",
    "1998 , cagnoni et al . 1998 ) .",
    "all these issues will be tackled in a forthcoming paper ( gilli et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "our results on the distribution of the absorbing n@xmath2 has important implications also on the spatial extension of the obscuring medium .",
    "indeed , it is not clear yet whether the obscuring gas is confined in a relatively dense circumnuclear torus ( with typical radius of a few pc ) , or is distributed in a larger volume on the 100-pc1-kpc scale . obscuring",
    "material distributed on the 100pc scales has been observed directly by means of hst images of nearby agns ( e.g. malkan et al .",
    "1998 ) ; it has been inferred also from the shape of the infrared spectra ( granato et al .",
    "1997 ) and from the shortage of edge  on systems in several seyfert galaxy samples ( keel 1980 , maiolino & rieke 1995 , simcoe et al .",
    "if we assume that the obscuring gas is distributed within a radius @xmath26 from the nucleus and with a covering factor @xmath27 , then the gas mass enclosed within the region is @xmath28 where n@xmath2 is the absorbing column density along the lines of sight that intersect the obscuring medium . if we assume that the covering factor @xmath27 is responsible for the observed sy2/sy1 ratio ( @xmath29 ) if sy1.8s and sy1.9s are grouped together in the type 2 class . ] and for the opening angle of the observed light cones , then @xmath30 . in the case of compton thick sy2s a radius of the obscuring region of the order of 100 pc",
    "would imply a gas mass of the order of or larger than @xmath31 , that in many objects exceeds by itself the dynamical mass in the same region .",
    "one way to have the compton thick obscuring gas extended over the 100pc scale would be to assume that its covering factor @xmath32 is very small ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "until a few years ago , when the only known compton thick source was ngc 1068 , this possibility could have been plausible . however , our new results imply @xmath34 . as a consequence in most agns",
    "the compton thick gas must be distributed on scales significantly smaller than 100 pc .",
    "we can investigate this issue in detail in two well studied sources , circinus and ngc 1068 .",
    "circinus has an n@xmath35 ( matt et al .",
    "1999 ) , and maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998b ) have mapped its dynamical mass by means of integral field spectroscopy on scales from 100 pc down to the central 10 pc .",
    "they concluded that the compton thick gas must be contained within @xmath36 pc not to exceed the dynamical mass .",
    "as for ngc 1068 , if the compton thick gas ( n@xmath37 ) were distributed over the central 200 pc then the implied gas mass ( @xmath38 ) would exceed the dynamical mass by a factor larger than 3 ( thatte et al . 1997 ) , and would exceed the gas mass estimated by means of co observations by a factor larger than 100 ( helfer 1997 ) . on the other hand , gas with lower column densities (",
    "@xmath39 or lower ) could extend over the 100pc scale .",
    "we combine a large number of published and archived hard x - ray data of seyfert 2 galaxies in the maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) sample , that provide information on the absorbing column density n@xmath2 . from this database",
    "we select a subsample of objects that is limited in the _ intrinsic _ flux of the active nucleus , as deduced from the reddening corrected [ oiii ] line . after correcting for a residual incompleteness",
    ", we derive the distribution of the absorbing n@xmath2 of this subsample .",
    "this can be regarded as the best approximation ( to date ) to the real distribution of n@xmath2 for the local population of ( moderately luminous ) seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "statistical errors of the distribution are also derived .",
    "the n@xmath2 distribution turns out to be quite different from previous estimates . in particular ,",
    "75% of all sy2s in our final sample are heavily obscured ( n@xmath40 ) and about half are compton thick ( n@xmath41 ) .",
    "if treated separately , intermediate type 1.81.9 seyfert galaxies are characterized by an average n@xmath2 much lower than `` strict '' seyfert 2s .    in previous models of the cosmic x - ray background",
    "the largest set of free parameters was contained in the n@xmath2 distribution .",
    "our empirical distribution can now be used instead , and it is expected to pose tight constraints to these models .",
    "the n@xmath2 distribution has also important implications on the spatial extension of the absorbing medium ( the putative torus ) .",
    "the large fraction of compton thick seyfert 2s implies that most of the compton thick gas must be located within a few 10 pc from the nucleus , in order not to exceed the dynamical mass in the central region .",
    "however , gas with low n@xmath2 could extend to larger radii ( 100 pc or more ) .",
    "finally , we do not find evidence for any correlation between the absorbing n@xmath2 and the intrinsic luminosity of active nuclei , over a range of luminosities spanning 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "we are grateful to s. ueno for providing us with information on his data in advance of publication .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments .",

    "ngc 4945 and ic 2560 do not have [ oiii ] data , but their x - ray properties imply that the intrinsic [ oiii ] flux must be high based on the following considerations .",
    "ngc 4945 is one of the nearest active galaxies and is among the brightest agns at energies around 100 kev .",

    "both the spectral shape and the high x/[oiii ] flux ratio ( f@xmath43/f@xmath11}$ ] = 30 ) strongly suggest that this is a compton thin source .",
    "the spectral fit constrains the n@xmath2 to be lower than @xmath46 ( at a confidence level of 90% ) .",
    "2 .   ngc 5005 shows a steep powerlaw spectrum with spectral index 2.15@xmath47 and no absorption .",
    "the 210 kev flux is 3@xmath48 @xmath8erg s@xmath9 and the 6.4 kev iron k@xmath49 line is not detected , but with a high upper limit on its equivalent width ( 900 ev ) .",
    "the x/[oiii ] flux ratio is low ( f@xmath43/f@xmath11}$ ] = 0.15 ) , locating this source among the compton thick sources in the diagram of b99 .",
    "there is no evidence of a cold reflected component at high energies ( e@xmath165 kev ) .",
    "our interpretation is that we see only the extended starburst component of the host galaxy , while the agn x - ray emission is fully absorbed .",
    "the absence of the reflected component may be due to orientation effects ( the reflecting torus may be almost perfectly edge  on ) .",
    "for this reason we estimate a lower limit for the nuclear n@xmath2 of 10@xmath24 @xmath8 , which is the minimum value required to absorb all the direct emission in the asca spectral range .",
    "ic 2560 has a prominent iron line with ew(fe)=6.3@xmath50 kev ( e=6.56@xmath51 kev ) typical of a compton thick sy2 .",
