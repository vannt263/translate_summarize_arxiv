    "we refer to the monograph @xcite for details on the theory of grbner bases .",
    "the concept of comprehensive grbner bases can be considered as an extension of these bases for polynomials over fields to polynomials with parametric coefficients .",
    "this extension plays an important role in application to constructive algebraic geometry , robotics , electrical network , automatic theorem proving and so on ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "_ comprehensive grbner bases _ and equivalent to them _ comprehensive grbner systems _ were introduced in 1992 by weispfenning @xcite .",
    "he proved that any parametric polynomial ideal has a comprehensive grbner basis and described an algorithm to compute it . in 2002 , montes @xcite proposed a more efficient algorithm ( dispgb ) for computing comprehensive grbner systems .",
    "a year later weispfenning in @xcite proved the existence of a canonical comprehensive grbner basis . in 2003 ,",
    "sato and suzuki @xcite introduced the concept of alternative comprehensive grbner bases .",
    "then in 2006 , manubens and montes in @xcite by using discriminant ideal improved dispgb , and in @xcite they introduced an algorithm for computing minimal canonical grbner systems . also in 2006 , sato and suzuki @xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggested an important computational improvement for comprehensive grbner bases by constructing the reduced grbner bases in polynomial rings over ground fields . in 2010 ,",
    "kapur , sun and wang @xcite , by combining weispfenning s algorithm @xcite with suzuki and sato s algorithm @xcite , proposed a new algorithm for computing comprehensive grbner systems .",
    "more recently , in 2010 , montes and wibmer in @xcite presented the grbnercover algorithm ( its implementation in singular is available at http://www-ma2.upc.edu/@xmath0montes/ ) which computes a finite partition of the parameter space into locally closed subsets together with polynomial data and such that the reduced grbner basis for given values of parameters can immediately be determined from the partition .",
    "_ involutive bases _ form an important class of grbner bases .",

    "_  @xcite .",
    "gerdt and blinkov @xcite proposed a more general concept of involutive bases for polynomial ideals and designed efficient algorithmic methods to construct such bases .",
    "the underlying idea of the involutive approach is to translate the methods originating from janet s approach into the polynomial ideals theory in order to provide a method for construction of involutive bases by combining algorithmic ideas in the theory of grbner bases with constructive ideas in the theory of involutive differential systems . in doing so",
    ", gerdt and blinkov @xcite introduced the concept of _ involutive division_. moreover , they derived the involutive form of buchberger s criteria .",
    "this led to a strong computational tool which is a serious alternative to the conventional buchberger algorithm .",
    "we refer to seiler s book @xcite for a comprehensive study and application of involution to commutative algebra and geometric theory of partial differential equations .    in this paper ,",
    "we introduce a notion of _ comprehensive involutive systems_. for a parametric ideal , we decompose the space of parameters into a finite set of cells , and for each cell we yield the corresponding involutive basis of the ideal . thereby , for each values of parameters , we find first a cell containing these values .",
    "then , by substituting these values into the corresponding basis , we get the involutive basis of the given ideal . based on the gerdt",
    " blinkov involutive ( abbreviated below by gbi ) algorithm as described in @xcite and also the montes dispgb algorithm @xcite , we present an algorithm for constructing comprehensive involutive systems . the proposed algorithm has been implemented in maple , and we provide an illustrative example showing the step - by - step results of the algorithm .    the paper is structured as follows .",
