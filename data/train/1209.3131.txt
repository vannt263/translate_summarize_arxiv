    "when calculating quantum spectra with the help of periodic - orbit sums such as , for example , arising from semiclassical expressions , one typically encounters problems due to divergencies resulting from summing over a large number of periodic orbits which grows exponentially with length .",
    "this is in particular the case for quantum systems whose underlying classical dynamics is chaotic @xcite . to apply these periodic - orbit expressions for determining quantum spectra",
    ", the number of relevant orbits needs to be reduced .",
    "this is either achieved by reordering the orbit contributions making use of cancellations such as is done in the cycle expansion @xcite or one can also utilise unitarity of the quantum dynamics leading to additional relations between the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and thus to finite sums over pseudo - orbits @xcite .",
    "a related problem is the semiclassical calculation of spectral correlation functions .",
    "they are conjectured to follow random matrix theory ( rmt ) for quantum systems with chaotic classical limit . establishing this connection explicitly using semiclassical periodic - orbit formulae for the spectral form factor",
    "could only be achieved fairly recently following the work in @xcite .",
    "this calculation has been extended in @xcite yielding the full spectral form factor as predicted by rmt for times smaller than the heisenberg time @xmath0 .",
    "( this is the time needed to resolve distances of the order of the mean level spacing in the fourier - transformed spectrum ) .",
    "the spectral form factor for times larger than @xmath0 has been obtained using semiclassical periodic - orbit expressions in @xcite .",
    "the calculation is based on a generating function approach containing two spectral determinants both in the numerator and denominator at four different energies .",
    "the derivation makes explicit use of the fact that the spectral determinant is real for real energies .",
    "although this is obvious from its definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) below , it is not clear a - priory when considering the representation of the spectral determinant containing periodic - orbit sums . a real spectral determinant in terms of periodic orbits",
    "can only be semiclassically obtained by exploiting periodic - orbit correlations due to unitarity .",
    "+ the above problem illustrates that we need a better understanding of correlations between periodic orbits and in particular correlations between long and short orbits . to analyse these correlations in more detail , we study here quantum unitary dynamics described in terms of finite dimensional unitary matrices , i.e.  quantum unitary maps . in this case",
    "periodic orbits refer to products of elements of the describing unitary matrix with their indices forming a closed cycle .",
    "we give later an interpretation in terms of periodic orbits on quantum graphs @xcite where exact periodic - orbit expansions for spectral quantities exist .",
    "these expansions are of similar form as the semiclassical approximations obtained for more general systems .",
    "we will in particular advocate to consider spectral quantities in terms of sub - determinant expansions . by this",
    "we obtain a much more detailed relation between contributions from orbits of different length for closed systems .",
    "the previously known relations @xcite only connect the _ overall _ ( summated ) contributions to spectral quantities from long and short orbits .",
    "we , however , derive a relation between contributions from short orbits within _ different _ parts of the system and its corresponding complementary orbits .",
    "such an identity is of particular importance when spatially inhomogeneous effects , such as a magnetic field , that affect the contributions from _ different _ orbits of the _ same _ length differently are considered .",
    "we expect it also to lead to simplifications in the diagrammatic expansions in @xcite .",
    "we afterwards will derive sub - determinant expressions for a range of important spectral quantities and consider these for examples such as quantum graphs .",

    "the density of states can be expressed as @xmath49 in the limit @xmath50 .",

    "as this identity is of great relevance in the paper we also give its proof .",
    "we will interpret this identity in terms of periodic orbits and will discuss the implications for spectral measures in the remainder of the article . + * theorem * : _ let @xmath1 be a unitary matrix of dimension @xmath2 with determinant @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 . denote the complement of @xmath20 in @xmath18 by @xmath55 .",

' '' ''    this identity implies some fundamental connections between orbits and pseudo - orbits of dynamical systems , which , in our view , are worth exploring .",
    "we will discuss these implications in the following sections .    as a straightforward consequence ,",
    "one obtains for the zeta function ( [ zeta_ud ] ) for @xmath2 odd , @xmath64 the formula remains true for @xmath2 even if appropriate care is taken for contributions with @xmath65 ; only half of these contributions should be counted and this half needs to be chosen appropriately .",

    "before we turn to express the density of states or spectral correlation functions in a similar fashion , we will consider how the identity ( [ subdet_id ] ) can be interpreted in a periodic orbit language .",
    "to this end , we briefly explain what we mean by a periodic orbit in terms of a finite matrix and introduce some related notation .",

    "one should think of a periodic orbit as a set of indices of the matrix @xmath1 that are visited in a periodic way .",
    "note that by the term periodic orbit , we do not yet refer to classical orbits in the sense of a continuous classical dynamics , but to products of elements of @xmath1 with the indices forming a cycle .",

    "irreducible _ periodic orbit never returns to the same index , that is , all @xmath74 are different ; the length of an irreducible orbit is at most @xmath2 .",
    "we also define the ( quantum ) amplitude @xmath75 of a periodic orbit .",
    "if @xmath72 is not irreducible one may write its amplitude as a product of amplitudes of irreducible orbits , for instance @xmath76 .    a _ pseudo - orbit _ @xmath77 with non - negative integers @xmath78 is a formal abelian product of periodic orbits @xmath79 with length @xmath80 and amplitude @xmath81",
    ". we will say that a pseudo - orbit is _ completely reduced _ if it is a formal product of irreducible orbits and _ irreducible _ if all @xmath78 are either one or zero and if any given index appears at most in one @xmath79 with @xmath82 .",
    "these definitions allow us to write the trace @xmath83 as a sum over amplitudes of periodic orbits of length @xmath11 .",
    "using @xmath84 in ( [ dos_zeta ] ) and expanding the logarithm one arrives at the trace formula @xmath85 where sum over @xmath72 extends over the set of all primitive orbits denoted by @xmath86 , and the additional sum is over all repetitions . here , like in eq .",
    "( [ dos_zeta ] ) , it is always understood that @xmath87 and the limit @xmath50 is taken .",
    "performing the sum over repetitions in the trace formula shows that it is equivalent to an euler - product type expansion @xmath88 note that this is an infinite product ( which converges for @xmath89 ) and analytical continuation is necessary to move back to the axis @xmath90 .",
    "such an analytic continuation is of course given by the expression ( [ zeta_u ] ) which is by definition a finite polynomial in @xmath91 .",
    "strong correlations between the amplitudes of long and short periodic orbits have to exist in order to reconcile both expressions .",
    "indeed , large cancellations can be shown to exist by expanding the product ( [ euler_prod ] ) and ordering the terms with increasing orbit length such as in the _ cycle expansion _ proposed in @xcite .",
    "after expressing amplitudes of reducible ( arbitrarily long ) orbits as product of amplitudes of irreducible ( and thus short ) orbits , the cancellation mechanism emerges @xcite .",

    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between these irreducible pseudo - orbits and permutations .",
    "indeed any permutation of symbols in @xmath20 can be written uniquely as a product of cycles such that each symbol appears exactly once ( up to the ordering of the cycles which is irrelevant as they commute ) .",

    "we denote the number of cycles ( irreducible orbits ) that make up a given pseudo - orbit @xmath93 as @xmath97 such that @xmath98 gives the parity of the permutation .",
    "everything said in the previous subsection is valid for general , not necessarily unitary matrices .",
    "unitarity leads to further non - trivial relations between the amplitudes of short and long orbits such as the functional equation ( [ func_eq ] ) resulting in the relation ( [ coeff_identity ] ) for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial which can in turn be written in terms of orbits .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : sub_det ] , we showed that there is a much more detailed link between sub - determinants and thus between orbits .",
    "the identity ( [ subdet_id ] ) , @xmath99 , also provides a connection between short and long orbits , but it has in addition an interesting interpretation in terms of linking irreducible pseudo - orbits in different parts of phase space. @xmath20 and its complement @xmath100 are by definition disjoint and its union forms the whole set @xmath13 . as stated in eq .",
    "( [ subdet - pseudo ] ) , @xmath101 consist of all irreducible orbits and pseudo - orbits which completely cover the set @xmath20 , @xmath100 , respectively , ( passing through every index in each of the sets exactly once ) .",
    "the relation ( [ subdet_id ] ) thus implies that the sum over all irreducible pseudo - orbits that cover @xmath20 is equivalent in weight to the sum over all irreducible pseudo - orbits that cover its complement @xmath100 .",
    "the two contributions from the pseudo - orbits in @xmath20 and the complement @xmath100 yield together a real term in the spectral determinant , as the contributions from @xmath20 and @xmath100 are complex conjugated to each other up to a global phase",

    "ordering the sequence @xmath121 such that it is non - decreasing in length , then @xmath122 gives the @xmath11-th trace in terms of contributions which can be computed from irreducible orbits of length smaller than @xmath120 . in the following it",

    "( [ btau ] ) , we consider @xmath233 .",

    "( [ form2 ] ) , which we obtained from periodic - orbit expansions , coincides for all @xmath258 with the result obtained in @xcite starting from the eigenvalues of the quantum scattering map .",
    "this is the first derivation of the result ( [ form2 ] ) from periodic - orbit expressions for general @xmath258 . in @xcite , a derivation based on periodic - orbit expressions",
    "was only done for @xmath259 .",
    "note that in contrast to @xcite we also take into account contributions beyond the diagonal approximation . due to the factor @xmath260 appearing in the eqs .",
    "( [ form3 ] , [ form4 ] ) the ones with @xmath261 odd contribute with negative signs leading together with the ones with @xmath261 even to a form factor smaller than expected in diagonal approximation ; as expected it tends to @xmath262 for @xmath263 .",
    "the goal of this article is two - fold : first of all , we advocate considering sub - determinant expansions for spectral functions and statistical measures such the density of states or various correlation functions .",
    "this makes it possible to separate out contributions which vanish after averaging and those whose non - diagonal contributions survive averaging . secondly , we considered a sub - determinant identity due to unitarity which makes it possible to give much more detailed relations between short and long orbits on a graph than considered before .",
    "in particular , this identity implies that contributions to the characteristic polynomial originating from irreducible pseudo - orbits of a certain sub - graph have the same weight as the irreducible pseudo - orbits of the complement of that sub - graph and are additionally linked through a common phase factor .",
    "previously , only relations between the overall contributions from pseudo orbits of a certain length and the complementary length were studied .",
    "the identity leads to simplified expressions for the characteristic polynomial , the newton identities and the spectral density .",
    "furthermore we study the effect of this identity on spectral correlation functions such as the auto - correlation function of the characteristic polynomial , the parametric cross correlation function and the spectral form factor .",
    "we derive explicit expressions using sub - determinant expansions for a simple model , star graphs consisting of @xmath2 bonds connected by a single vertex .",
    "we then work out in more detail the simplest case @xmath209 .",
    "the identity ( [ subdet_id ] ) is essential to obtaining the behaviour of correlation functions for small energy differences or large times .",
    "it captures additional correlations between orbits of different length and needs to be taken into account when singling out correlated orbits which survive averaging .",
    "this is especially important when spatial inhomogeneities affect different parts of the phase space in different ways .    in this context",
    "several potentially interesting extensions arise : taking the semiclassical limit on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ newton_gamma2 ] ) , the two expressions are semiclassically not obviously identical .",
    "the left - hand side leads to the gutzwiller trace formula which contains orbits of arbitrary length while the right - hand side contains pseudo - orbits of finite length ( and their repetitions ) . for short orbits @xmath264",
    ", one may argue that the two expressions have a semiclassically small difference , for longer orbits this is far less obvious .",
    "a second point concerns the exponential proliferation of the number of orbits in the standard trace formulae .",
    "it is tamed to a certain degree when using sub - determinants by the fact that different contributions contribute with different signs .",
    "thus the sub - determinant expressions contain large fluctuations .",
    "understanding overall cancellations is an interesting task .",
    "for example , the form factor for the two - star graph for large @xmath11 contains positive and negative contributions which on their own grow as @xmath265 while their difference remains @xmath266 as can be checked from the expressions for @xmath235 given above .    the analysis of spectral correlations focused here on the general unitary case .",
    "it would be interesting to include the effect of self crossings of orbits that allow for partners traversing parts of the diagram in different directions .",
    "this would capture effects arising due to time reversal symmetry .    for graphs",
    "the supersymmetry technique gives an alternative approach to obtain universal results @xcite .",
    "with supersymmetry one may derive universality under sufficiently nice conditions , however , rigorous proofs are still not available . the main obstacle for the supersymmetric approach seems to be repetitions which are difficult to incorporate correctly @xcite . the proposed approach may help us understanding the effect repetitions on spectral correlation functions .",
