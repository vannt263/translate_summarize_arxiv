    "kippenhahn , kohl & weigert ( 1967 ) were the first who followed the formation of helium white dwarfs ( wd ) of low mass in a binary system .",
    "the evolution of a helium wd of 0.26@xmath4 ( remnant ) was investigated by kippenhahn , thomas & weigert ( 1968 ) who found that a hydrogen flash can be initiated near the base of the hydrogen rich envelope .",
    "the energy of the flash is sufficient to cause the envelope to expand to giant dimensions and hence it may be possible that another short term roche lobe filling can occur .    in webbink ( 1975 ) , models of a helium white dwarf were constructed by formally evolving a model from the homogeneous zero  age main sequence with the reduction of the mass of the hydrogen  rich envelope . when the mass of the envelope is less than some critical value , the model contracts adopting white dwarf dimensions .",
    "webbink found that thermal flashes do not occur for wds less massive than 0.2@xmath4 .",
    "alberts et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have confirmed webbink s finding that low ",
    "mass white dwarfs do not show thermal flashes and the cooling age for wds of mass @xmath5@xmath60.20@xmath7 can be considerably underestimated if using the traditional wd cooling curves which were constructed for @xmath8@xmath90.3@xmath7 ( iben & tutukov 1986 , it 86 ) .",
    "recently , hansen & phinney ( 1998a  hp98 ) and benvenuto & althaus ( 1998  ba98 ) investigated the effect of different mass of the hydrogen layer ( @xmath10 ) on the cooling evolution of @xmath11 helium wds . in both calculations ( ba98 and hp98 ) the mass of the hydrogen envelope left on the top of white dwarf has been taken as free parameter .",
    "ba98 found that thick envelopes appreciably modify the radii and surface gravities of no  h models , especially in the case of low ",
    "mass helium white dwarfs .",
    "driebe et al .",
    "( 1998  dsbh98 ) present a grid of evolutionary tracks for low - mass white dwarfs with helium cores in the mass range from 0.179 to 0.414@xmath4 .",
    "the tracks are based on a 1@xmath4 model sequence extending from the pre ",
    "main sequence stage up to the tip of red giant branch . applying large mass loss rates forced the models to move off the giant branch and evolve across the hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram and down the cooling branch .",
    "they found that hydrogen flashes take place only for two model sequences , 0.234@xmath4 and 0.259@xmath12 , and for very low  mass wds the hydrogen shell burning remains dominant even down to effective temperatures well below 10 000 k. according to our previous calculations ( ergma , sarna & antipova , 1998 ) we find that for a low  mass white dwarf with a helium core , which was formed during low  mass binary evolution ( after detachment from the roche lobe ) , the hydrogen layer left on the top of the helium core is much thicker ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 ranging from 0.3 to 0.52 ) than used in cooling calculation by hp98 and ba98 .",
    "also in dsbh98 ( see their table 1 ) , for the two lowest total remnant masses the envelope mass value is smaller that obtained in our calculations .",
    "low  mass helium white dwarfs are present in millisecond binary pulsars and double degenerate systems .",
    "this gives a unique opportunity to test the cooling age of the wd in a binary and , especially in the case of millisecond binary pulsars , allows for age determinations for neutron stars that are independent of their rotational history .",
    "the evolutionary sequences we have calculated are comprised of three main phases :    @xmath15 detached evolution lasting until the companion fills its roche lobe on the time  scale @xmath16 ;    @xmath17 semi  detached evolution ( non  conservative in our calculations ) on the time  scale @xmath18 ; @xmath19=@xmath20 ;    @xmath17 a cooling phase of the wd on the time ",
    "scale @xmath21 ( the final phase during which a system with a ms pulsar + low  mass helium wd is left behind ) .",
    "the total evolutionary time is @xmath22 .",
    "the duration of the detached phase is somewhat uncertain ; it may be determined either by the nuclear time ",
    "scale or by the much shorter time ",
    "scale of the orbital angular momentum loss owing to the magnetized stellar wind .    in our calculations",
    "we assume that the semi  detached evolution of a binary system is non  conservative , i.e. the total mass and angular momentum of the system are not conserved .",
    "we can express the total orbital angular momentum ( j ) of a binary system as    @xmath23    where the terms on the right hand side are due to : stellar mass angular momentum loss from the system , magnetic stellar wind braking , and gravitational wave radiation .",
    "the formalism which we have adopted is described in muslimov & sarna ( 1993 ) .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath24 characterizing the loss of mass from the binary system and defined by the relations ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the mass  loss rate from the system , @xmath27 is the rate of mass loss from the donor ( secondary ) star and @xmath28 is the accretion rate onto the neutron star ( primary ) .",
    "the matter leaving the system will carry off its intrinsic angular momentum in agreement with formula    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the masses of the neutron star and donor star , respectively and m=@xmath30+@xmath31 . here",
    "we have introduced the additional parameter @xmath32 , which describes the efficiency of the orbital angular momentum loss from the system due to a stellar wind ( tout & hall 1991 ) . in our calculations we have @xmath32=1 and @xmath24=1 ; we calculate the fully non  conservative case , although additional calculations with @xmath24 = 0.9 and 0.5 ( with @xmath32=1 ) give similar results . a similar result to ours",
    "was found by tauris ( 1996 ) , who showed that the change in orbital separation due to mass transfer in lmxb ( low  mass x - ray binaries ) as a function of the fraction of exchanged matter @xmath24 which is lost from system is small ( for 0.5@xmath33 ) . to understand whether the system evolution is conservative or non  conservative",
    "is not easy in the case of a rapidly rotating neutron star ; no easy solution can be found .",
    "we propose as one possibility a factor which may help us to distinguish between the two cases  the surface magnetic field of the neutron star and its evolution during the accretion .",
    "we also assume that the donor star , possessing a convective envelope , experiences magnetic braking ( mestel 1968 ; mestel & spruit 1987 ; muslimov & sarna 1995 ) , and , as a consequence , the system loses its orbital angular momentum . for a magnetic stellar wind we used the formula for the orbital angular momentum loss    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the separation of the components and the radius of the donor star in solar units .      for systems with very short orbital periods , during the final stages of their evolution we also take into account the loss of orbital angular momentum due to emission of gravitational radiation ( landau & lifshitz 1971 ) :",
    "@xmath37    the mass and accompanying orbital angular momentum loss from these system are poorly understood problems in the evolution of binary stars .",
    "as is well known , the variation of the angular momentum depends critically on the assumed model ( ergma et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the case of binary systems with ms pulsar typically",
    "two different models concerning the mass ejection and angular momentum loss can be adopted .",
    "the first is that the amount of angular momentum lost per 1 gram of ejected matter is equal to the average orbital angular momentum of 1 gram of the binary .",
    "the second is that the matter that flows from the companion star onto the neutron star ( after accretion ) is ejected isotropically with the specific angular momentum of the neutron star . in this paper , for our non  conservative approach we have adopted the first model .",
    "this affects significantly our results on the semi  detached evolution ( see fig . 2 in ergma et al .",
    "1998 ) , but very little changes the cooling time  scale of the helium white dwarf .      in all cases",
    "we have included the effect of illumination of the donor star by the millisecond pulsar . in our calculations",
    "we assume that illumination of the component by the hard ( x  ray and @xmath38ray ) radiation from the millisecond pulsar leads to additional heating of its photosphere ( muslimov & sarna 1993 ) .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath39 of the companion during the illumination stage is determined from the relation    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the intrinsic luminosity corresponding to the radiation flux coming from the stellar interior and @xmath42 is the stefan  boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath43 is the millisecond pulsar radiation that heats the photosphere , which is determined by    @xmath44    and @xmath45 is `` rotational luminosity '' of the neutron star due to magneto ",
    "dipole radiation ( plus a wind of relativistic particles )    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the neutron star radius , b is the value of the magnetic field strength at the neutron star and @xmath48 is the pulsar period .",
    "@xmath49 is the factor characterizing the efficiency of transformation of irradiation flux into thermal energy ( in our case we take @xmath50 ) .",
    "note that in our calculations the effect of irradiation is formally treated by means of modification of the outer boundary condition , according to relation ( 6 ) .",
    "in this paper we do not follow the magnetic field and pulsar period ( @xmath51 ) evolution , as we did in our earlier papers ( muslimov & sarna 1993 , ergma & sarna 1996 ) .",
    "we were mainly interested in finding initial models for low ",
    "mass helium white dwarfs and in investigating the initial cooling phase of these low  mass helium white dwarfs . from earlier calculations",
    "we know that if the magnetic field strength is greater than about @xmath52 g , the neutron star spins  up to tenths and hundreds of milliseconds , rather than several milliseconds .",
    "this leads to a situation where the pressure of the magneto ",
    "dipole radiation is insufficient to eject matter from the system . also from our previous calculations",
    "( see for example ergma & sarna 1996 ) we find that after accretion of a maximum of about 0.2@xmath1 , the neutron star has spun  up to millisecond periods if b@xmath53 g .",
    "therefore in this paper we accept that after accretion of 0.2@xmath1 the neutron star spins  up to about 2 ms .",
    "after spin  up the pulsar irradiation is strong enough to prevent accretion , and at this moment we include non  conservative mass loss from the system as described above .    during the initial high mass accretion phase ( @xmath54 , @xmath55yrs )",
    "the system may be observed as a bright low  mass x ",
    "ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "it is necessary to point out that majority of lmxbs for which orbital period determinations are available ( 21 systems out of 24 according to van paradijs catalogue 1995 ) , have orbital period of less than one day .",
    "these systems therefore can not be the progenitors of the majority of low ",
    "mass helium white dwarf + millisecond pulsar binary systems .",
    "a lack of lmxb systems with orbital period between 1  3 days does not allow us to make a direct comparison between the observational data and the results of our calculations .",
    "the models of the stars filling their roche lobes were computed using a standard stellar evolution code based on the henyey  type code of paczyski ( 1970 ) , which has been adapted to low  mass stars .",
    "the henyey method involves iteratively improving a trail solution for the whole star . during each iteration",
    ", corrections to all variables at all mesh points in the star are evaluated using the newton ",
    "raphson method for linearised algebraic equations ( see for example hansen & kawaler 1994 ) .",
    "the henyey method extended to calculate stellar evolution with mass loss , as adopted here , is well explain by zikowski ( 1970 ) .",
    "we note here that our code makes use of the stationary envelope technique , which was developed early on in the life of our code in order to save disc space ( paczyski 1969 ) .",
    "this method makes the assumption that the surface 0.5  5% ( by mass ) of the star is not significantly affected by nuclear processes , such that it can be treated to a good approximation as homogeneous region ( in composition ) throughout the whole evolutionary calculation . during the cooling phase",
    "we assume that the static envelope is the surface 0.5% of the star .",
    "this assumption is valid during the flashes because the time  scale is longer than thermal time ",
    "scale of the envelope .",
    "we tested the possibility that the algorithm for redistributing meshpoints introduces numerical diffusion into the composition profile .",
    "we find that if such numerical diffusion is real , it has only a marginal influence on the hydrogen profile .",
    "we would also like to note that in the heat equation we neglect the derivative with respect to molecular weight , since its effect is small .",
    "convection is treated with the mixing ",
    "length algorithm proposed by paczyski ( 1969 ) .",
    "we solve the problem of radiative transport by employing the opacity tables of iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) .",
    "where the iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) tables are incomplete , we have filled the gaps using the opacity tables of huebner et al .",
    "( 1977 ) . for temperatures less than 6000",
    "k we use the opacities given by alexander & ferguston ( 1994 ) and alexander ( private communication ) . the contribution from conduction present in the opacity tables of huebner et al .",
    "( 1977 ) has been included by us in the other tables , since they do nt include it ( haensel , private communication ) .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) includes radiation and gas pressure , which is composed of the ion and electron pressure .",
    "contribution to the eos owing to the non  ideal effects of coulomb interaction and pressure ionization which influence the eos , as discussed by pols et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , have not been included in our program , and for this reason we stopped our cooling calculations before these effects become important . during the initial phase of cooling , the physical conditions in the hot white dwarfs are such that these effects are usually small .",
    "we perform our evolutionary calculations for binary systems initially consisting of a 1.4 @xmath56 neutron star ( ns ) and a slightly evolved companion ( subgiant ) of two masses , 1 and 1.5 , and four chemical compositions ( z : 0.003 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 ) .",
    "we have produced ( table 1 ) a number of evolutionary tracks corresponding to the different possible values of the initial orbital period ( ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 days ) at the beginning of mass transfer phase .",
    "in table 1 we list the characteristic of the cooling phase of the wd , @xmath57 , and the maximum possible evolution time of a system , @xmath58 , which is a sum of times of detached ( determined by nuclear evolution ) , semi  detached , and cooling phases .",
    "the cooling is the last phase of evolution of the wd , and in our calculations starts at the end of rlof .",
    "the cooling time , @xmath57 , is limited to an initial cooling stage during which the wd cools until its central temperature has decreased by 50 @xmath59 of its maximum value . from table 1",
    "it is clearly seen that to produce short orbital period systems in a time ",
    "scale shorter than hubble time it is necessary either to have low z or a more massive secondary .    in our calculations",
    "the donor star fills its roche lobe while it is evolving through the hertzsprung gap , and therefore it transfers mass on its companion in a thermal time  scale .",
    "figure 1 show the evolutionary cooling sequences for models 20 and 22 ( more details in table 1 ) .",
    "model 20 presents the case with stable hydrogen burning .",
    "model 22 shows the case when the thermal instability of the hydrogen ",
    "burning shell occurs .",
    "the first flash is not strong enough to allow the star to overflow its roche lobe , but during the second flash the radius of the secondary increases to fill its roche lobe and short  time roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) occurs .    in table 2",
    "we present the mass  radius relationship for wds from our calculations , dsbh98 , the wood models , and the hamada & salpeter ( 1961 ) zero  temperature helium wd models calculated for a surface temperature of 8500 k ( as in van kerkwijk , bergeron & kulkarini 1996 for psr1012 + 5307 ) .",
    "comparison of the numbers demonstrate that for wd masses of @xmath60 0.25@xmath1 , the results of our calculations differ significantly from a simple extrapolation obtained from the cooling curves ( wood 1990 ) performed for carbon wds with the thick hydrogen envelopes .",
    "in addition comparing the cooling time  scales of hp98 and ba98 with those of webbink and our models , shows differences of an order of magnitude ( table 3 ) for wd masses of @xmath60 0.25@xmath1 .",
    "the problem of unstable hydrogen shell burning in low  mass helium wds was first discussed in the literature more than 30 years ago ( kippenhahn , thomas & weigert 1968 ) .",
    "recently , alberts et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have claimed that they do not see any thermal flashes that result from thermally unstable shell  burning , as reported in papers it86 and kippenhahn , thomas & weigert ( 1968 ) .",
    "webbink ( 1975 ) found that in none of his model sequences , such a severe thermal runaway as described by kippenhahn et al .",
    "( 1968 ) was found , although mild flashes for m@xmath90.2 @xmath7 did take place .",
    "alberts et al . found that even reducing the time step to 50100 years would not lead to thermally unstable shell  burning for @xmath5@xmath600.25 @xmath4 . in dsbh98 ,",
    "thermal instabilities of the hydrogen ",
    "burning shell occurs in their two models , 0.234@xmath4 and 0.259@xmath4 .",
    "they concluded that hydrogen flashes take place only in the mass interval 0.21@xmath6 @xmath61 .    according to our computations , low",
    " mass helium wds with masses more than 0.183@xmath4 ( z=0.03 ) , 0.192@xmath4 ( z=0.02 ) , 0.198@xmath4 ( z=0.01 ) and 0.213@xmath4 , ( z=0.003 ) may experience up to several hydrogen flashes before they enter the cooling stage . in table 4",
    "we present several characteristics for the computed flashes .",
    "we discussion two kinds of flashes : in the first case ( in table 4 shown as `` 1 '' ) , during the flash the secondary does not fill its roche lobe i.e. the mass of the white dwarf does not change , and in the second case ( `` 2 '' ) , during the unstable hydrogen burning phase the secondary fills its roche lobe and the system again enters into a very short duration accretion phase ( see table 4 ) .",
    "we introduce four time  scales to describe the flash behaviour : ( i ) the flash rise time ",
    "scale @xmath62 , which is the time for the luminosity to increase from minimum to maximum value ( typically this value is between few @xmath63 to few @xmath64 yrs  third column in the table 4 ) ; ( ii ) the flash decay time ",
    "scale @xmath65 , which is the time for the luminosity to decrease to the initial value ( typically from few hundred thousand to few tenth million years ) ; ( iii ) @xmath66 t is the recurrence time between two successive flashes ( iv ) @xmath67 is the duration of the accretion phase when the secondary fills its roche lobe during hydrogen shell flash .    for all sequences with several unstable hydrogen shell burning stages ( usually for case `` 1 '' ) ,",
    "the first flash is the weakest . in the majority of cases",
    "when the flash forces the star to fill its roche lobe , only one flash takes place . for four cases we found two successive flashes with roche lobe overflow ( models 17 , 23 , 24 , 31 ) , and for another two cases ( models 47 , 53 ) to the first flash is not powerful enough to force the secondary fill its roche lobe , but during the second flash it is",
    "how does the hydrogen flash burning influence the cooling time  scale ?",
    "in fig.2 , the luminosity and nuclear energy production rates versus cooling time for models 20 and 22 are shown .",
    "model 20 shows stationary hydrogen burning and model 22 , hydrogen flash burning .",
    "although before flash model 22 was more luminous than model 20 , later the situation is reversed .",
    "after the flash , the burning mass of the hydrogen rich envelope in model 22 has decreased to 0.0116@xmath68 , whereas the mass of the hydrogen envelope in model 20 , in which stationary hydrogen burning occurs , is almost twice as large ( 0.0241@xmath68 ) .",
    "if we look at how the maximum nuclear energy rate behaves with cooling time , we can see that after the flash in model 22 , the maximum energy production rate is less than in model 20 ( stationary hydrogen burning ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the behaviour of log@xmath69 , log @xmath70 and log l/@xmath71 , and in fig.4 log @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 as a function of cooling time for model 7 . before the helium white dwarf enters the final cooling phase , four unstable hydrogen flash burnings occur .",
    "the same parameters for model 17 ( with rlof ) are shown in figs . 5 and 6 .    to investigate in more detail how the flashes develop , we show in fig .",
    "7 the evolution of the white dwarf radius ( upper panel ) , nuclear energy generation rate ( upper middle panel ) , maximum shell temperature and central temperature ( lower middle panel ) and the surface luminosity ( lower panel ) as a function of computed model number . in fig . 7 , as vertical dashed lines we marked several time  scales which characterize the flash behaviour ( for numbers see table 4 ) .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath75 describe the rise and decay times ; the first characterizes the nuclear shell burning time  scale ( @xmath76 ) , the second the kelvin  helmholtz ( thermal ) envelope time  scale modified by nuclear shell burning ( @xmath77 ) . the accretion time ( @xmath78 ) is described by the square of the kelvin  helmholtz time",
    "the radiative diffusion time is defined as the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time ",
    "scale of the extended envelope above the shell ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the shape of the first flash on fig .",
    "7 shows some characteristic changes which are connected with physical processes in the stellar interior . at the beginning of the flash",
    "the luminosity increases due to the more effective hydrogen burning in the shell source . after reaching a local maximum",
    ", the luminosity then decreases while the nuclear energy generation rate is still increasing rapidly .",
    "this decrease of the surface luminosity is due to a temperature inversing forming below the hydrogen shell .",
    "the energy generated in the hydrogen shell splits into two fluxes ; coming outwards and going inwards .",
    "the helium core is heated effectively by the shell nuclear source  the central temperature increases by 2% . on fig .",
    "8 the evolution of the luminosity and temperature profiles during the @xmath80 and @xmath75 phases are shown .",
    "we clearly see how the inversion profile evolves and how the luminosity wave moves into the surface .",
    "the nuclear energy generation rate in the shell has a maximum value far away from maximum surface luminosity .",
    "this is because the luminosity front is moving towards the stellar surface in a time ",
    "scale described by radiative diffusion ( @xmath81 ) . after reaching a maximum value ,",
    "the luminosity starts to decrease and the energy generation rate also declines in the hydrogen shell over a time - scale @xmath75 ( for a contracting envelope ) the luminosity decreases to the minimum value . during the first flash",
    ", the stellar radius does not fill the inner roche lobe . in the second and third flashes we have short episodes of super  eddington mass transfer ( see table 4 ) . during the rlof phase , the orbital period slightly increases and the subgiant companion evolves quickly from spectral type f0 to a0 .",
    "as already pointed out , for several cases the secondary fills its roche lobe and the system enters an accretion phase . during rlof , the mass accretion rate is about three orders of magnitude greater than the eddington limit ( fig .",
    "all the accreted matter will be lost from the system ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the accretion phase is very short , usually less than 1000 years ( ranging from 160 to 2500 yrs  see table 4 ) . during the short super  eddington accretion phase the system is a very bright x  ray source , with orbital period between 2 to 8 days .",
    "we notice that during the flash the evolutionary time step strongly decreases and may be as short as several years .",
    "dsbh98 modelled single star evolution and produced white dwarfs with various masses by applying large mass loss rates at appropriate positions in the red  giant branch to force the models to move off the giant branch . to show how binarity influences the final fate of the white dwarf cooling ,",
    "we have computed extra sequences ( 1.0 + 1.4 @xmath7 , z=0.02 , @xmath83=2.0 days ) where we did not take into account that the star is in a binary system e.g. during hydrogen shell flash we do not allow rlof . in complete binary model calculation , only one shell flash occurs accompanied with rlof , whereas for the single star model calculation , four hydrogen shell flashes take place . due to rlof ,",
    "the duration of the flash phase is 2.7@xmath2yrs ; if we do not include binarity the duration of the flash phase is 1.8@xmath84yrs .",
    "however , the cooling time for helium white dwarfs less massive than 0.2@xmath1 is not significantly changed .",

    "( 1996 ) ( lower ) and callanan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( upper ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the callanan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimates .",
    "it is necessary to mention that after detachment from its roche lobe , the outer envelope is rather helium  rich .",
    "bergeron et al . (",
    "1991 ) have shown that a small amount of helium in a hydrogen  dominated envelope can mimic the effect of a larger gravity .",
    "the results of our evolutionary calculations differ from those of iben & tutukov ( 1986 ) and driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) because of the different formation scenarios for low  mass helium wds . in it86",
    "s calculations a donor star fills its roche lobe while it is on the red giant branch ( i.e. has a thick convective envelope ) with a well developed helium core and a thin hydrogen burning layer .",
    "they proposed that the mass transfer time scale is so short that the companion will not be able to accrete the transferred matter and will itself expand and overflow its roche lobe .",
    "the final output is the formation of a common envelope and the result of this evolution is a close binary with a helium wd of mass @xmath101 having a rather thin ( @xmath102 ) hydrogen  rich ( x=0.5 ) envelope .",
    "dsbh98 did not calculate the mass exchange phases during the red giant branch evolution in detail but they also simulated the mass  exchange episode by subjecting a red giant branch model to a sufficiently large mass loss rate . in both cases ( it86 and",
    "dsbh98 ) mass loss starts when the star ( with a well developed helium core ) is on the red giant branch .    in our calculations",
    "the roche lobe overflow starts when the secondary has either almost exhausted hydrogen in the center of the star or has a very small helium core with a thick hydrogen burning layer . during the semi ",
    "detached evolution the mass of the helium core increases from almost nothing to final value ( for more detail about evolution of such systems , see ergma , sarna & antipova , 1998 ) .",
    "this is the reason that a much thicker ( @xmath103 \\times   10^{-2}~m_{\\odot } $ ] , with x ranging from 0.30 to 0.52 ) hydrogen  rich envelope is left on the donor star at the moment it shrinks within the roche lobe .",
    "the second important point where our results differ from that of dsbh98 is that in our calculations we can produce ( after the secondary detaches from its roche lobe ) final millisecond binary pulsar parameters which we compare with observational data ( orbital period , spin period of ms pulsar , mass of the companion ) .",
    "it was shown by joss , rappaport & lewis ( 1987 ) and more recently by rappaport et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the evolution of a binary system initially comprising of a neutron star and a low  mass giant will end up as a wide binary containing a radio pulsar and a white dwarf in a nearly circular orbit .",
    "the relation between the white dwarf mass and orbital period ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) in rappaport et al .",
    "1995 ) shows that if the secondary fills its roche lobe while on the red giant branch , then for @xmath104 the final orbital period would be @xmath93 5 days , which is far from observed orbital period of the binary pulsar psr j 1012 + 5307 ( @xmath86=0.6 days ) .",
    "alberts et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , dsbh98 , and the results of our calculations demonstrate clearly that especially for low  mass helium wds ( @xmath60 0.2@xmath4 ) stationary hydrogen burning remains an important , if not the main , energy source . hp98 and ba98 did consider nuclear burning but found it to be of little importance since their artificially chosen hydrogen envelope mass was less than some critical value , disallowing significant hydrogen burning . if we compare now the cooling curves of hp98 , dsh98 with ours then there is one very important difference ; they did not model the evolution of the helium wd progenitor and all their cooling models ( see for example figs",
    ". 11 , 12 in hp98 ) start with a high @xmath105 . in our models ,",
    "cooling of the helium wd starts after detachment of the secondary from its roche lobe ( dsbh98 mimic this situation with mass loss from the star ) .",
    "this time , the secondary ( proto  white dwarf ) has rather low effective temperature ( see for example fig.1 ) . during the evolution with l approximately constant , the effective temperature increases to a maximum value , after which it decreases while still having a active hydrogen shell burning source . the evolutionary time needed for the proto ",
    "white dwarf to travel from the minimum @xmath105 ( after detachment from roche lobe ) to maximum @xmath105 depends strongly on mass of the wd ( for a smaller mass a longer evolutionary time ",
    "scale ) .",
    "so for low ",
    "mass helium wds the evolutionary prehistory plays a very important role in cooling history of the white dwarf .",
    "we have performed comprehensive evolutionary calculations to produce a close binary system consisting of a ns and a low  mass helium wd .",
    "we argue that the presence of a thick hydrogen layer changes dramatically the cooling time  scale of the helium white dwarf ( @xmath106 ) , compared to the previous calculations ( hp98 , ba98 ) where the mass of the hydrogen envelope was chosen as free parameter and was usually one order of magnitude less than that obtained from real binary evolution computations .",
    "also , we have demonstrated that using new cooling tracks we can consistently explain the evolutionary status of the binary pulsar psr j1012 + 53 .",
