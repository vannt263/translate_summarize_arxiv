    "bl lacertae (= 1es  2200 + 420 ; z = 0.069 ) was historically the prototype of the bl lac class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these objects are characterized by continuum properties similar to those of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( non - thermal optical continuum , high degree of linear polarization , rapid variability at all wavelengths , radio jets with individual components often exhibiting apparent superluminal motion ) , but do usually show only weak emission or absorption lines ( with equivalent width in the rest - frame of the host galaxy of @xmath6   ) , if any . in bl  lacertae itself , however , h@xmath7 ( and h@xmath8 ) emission lines have been detected during a period of several weeks in 1995 @xcite , and in 1997 @xcite .",
    "superluminal motion of @xmath9 up to @xmath10 has been observed in this object @xcite .",
    "bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are commonly unified in the agn class of blazars .",
    "sixty - five blazars have been detected and identified with high confidence in high energy ( @xmath11  mev ) gamma - rays by the egret instrument on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ @xcite . to date , 6 blazars have been detected at very high energies ( @xmath12  gev ) with ground - based air erenkov detectors @xcite .",
    "all of these belong to the sub - class of high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ( hbls ) . the field of extragalactic gev  tev astronomy is currently one of the most rapidly expanding research areas in astrophysics .",
    "the steadily improving flux sensitivities of the new generation of air erenkov telescope arrays and their decreasing energy thresholds ( for a recent review see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provides a growing potential to extend their extragalactic - source list towards intermediate and even low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ( lbls ) with lower @xmath13 peak frequencies in their broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "detection of such objects at energies @xmath14  100  gev might provide an opportunity to probe the intrinsic high - energy cutoff of their seds since at those energies , @xmath15 absorption due to the intergalactic infrared background is still expected to be negligible at redshifts of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "there has even been a claimed detection of bl  lacertae in 1998 with the erenkov telescope of the crimean astrophysical observatory @xcite ; however , this detection could not be confirmed by any other group so far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "bl  lacertae is classified as an lbl . from an interpolation between the ghz radio spectrum and the ir - optical spectrum",
    ", it can be inferred that its low - frequency spectral component typically peaks at mm to @xmath17 m wavelengths , while the high - frequency component seems to peak in the multi - mev  gev energy range .",
    "bl  lacertae has been the target of many radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath18-ray observations in the past , and has been studied in detail during various intensive multiwavelength campaigns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is a particularly interesting object for detailed x - ray studies : this is the region of the electromagnetic spectrum where the two broad components of the multiwavelength seds of bl  lacertae ( and other lbls ) are overlapping and intersecting .",
    "x - ray observations of this source at different epochs show significant flux and spectral variability , indicating that the x - ray emission is at times dominated by the high - energy end of the synchrotron emission , while at other occasions it is dominated by the low - frequency portion of the high - energy bump of the sed .",
    "in fact , bl  lacertae has repeatedly shown a concave shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , with rapid variability mainly restricted to the low - energy excess portion of the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in the framework of relativistic jet models , the low - frequency ( radio  optical / uv )",
    "emission from blazars is interpreted as synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons in a relativistic jet . the high - frequency ( x - ray ",
    "@xmath18-ray ) emission could either be produced via compton upscattering of low frequency radiation by the same electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission ( leptonic jet models ; for a recent review see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or due to hadronic processes initiated by relativistic protons co - accelerated with the electrons ( hadronic models , for a recent discussion see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "those authors have also demonstrated that a combination of broadband spectra with timing and spectral variability information , in tandem with time - dependent model simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can help to break some of these degeneracies .",
    "for this reason , we organized an intensive multiwavelength campaign to observe bl  lacertae in the second half of 2000 at as many frequencies as possible , putting special emphasis on detailed variability information . in  [ observations ] , we describe the observations carried out during the campaign and present light curves in the various energy bands .",

    "however , as pointed out and discussed by @xcite and in  [ spectra ] , the optical and x - ray spectra during this observation can not be connected by a smooth power - law : the optical fluxes are significantly below a power - law extrapolation of the _ beppo_sax lecs + mecs spectrum .",

    "obvious spectral variability was detected , and the color changes were more sensitive to rapid variations than the long - term flux level . during well - sampled , short flares ( on time scales of a few hours ) , the color changes strictly follow the flux variability in the sense that the spectra are harder when the flux is higher ( see fig . 7 of * ? ? ?",
