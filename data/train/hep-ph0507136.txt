    "in ref.@xcite , we have systematically studied the transverse momentum effects and the higher helicity components contributions to the pion form factor based on the lc framework and the @xmath0 factorization formalism@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 factorization theorem has been widely applied to various processes and it provides a scheme to take the dependence of the parton transverse momentum @xmath0 into account .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 dependence in the wavefunction can generate much larger effects than the usual sudakov suppression to the hard scattering amplitude in the present experimental @xmath7 region , which shows that it is substantial to take the @xmath0 dependence in the wavefunction into account .",
    "the light cone ( lc ) formalism provides a convenient framework for the relativistic description of the hadron in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom , and the application of pqcd to exclusive processes has mainly been developed in this formalism@xcite . in ref.@xcite , we have given a consistent treatment of the pion form factor within the lc pqcd framework , i.e. both the wavefunction and the hard interaction kernel are treated within the framework of lc pqcd .",
    "taking into account the spin space wigner rotation , one may find that there are higher - helicity components ( @xmath2 ) in the lc spin - space wavefunction besides the usual - helicity components ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the hard - scattering amplitude for the higher - helicity components including the transverse momentum in the quark propagator is of order @xmath8 , which is the next to leading order contribution compared with the contribution coming from the ordinary helicity component , but it can give sizable contribution to the pion form factor at the intermediate energies .    in order to compare the predictions with the experimental data , one needs to know the contribution from the soft part . as an example , we have considered the soft contribution to the pion form factor with a reasonable wavefunction in the lc framework .",
    "our results show that the soft contribution from the higher helicity components has a quite different behavior from that of the hard scattering part and has the same order contribution as that of the usual helicity ( @xmath4 ) components in the energy region ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "as @xmath10 , the higher helicity components contributions will decrease with the increasing @xmath7 . at about @xmath11 ,",
    "the higher helicity components contributions become negative and as a result the net soft contribution to the pion form factor will then decrease with the increasing @xmath7 , which tends to zero at about @xmath12 . although the soft contribution is purely non - perturbative and model - dependent , the calculated prediction for the pion form factor should take the @xmath0 dependence in the soft and hard parts into account beside including the higher order contributions .",
    "therefore one needs to keep the transverse momentum in the next leading order corrections and to construct a realistic @xmath0 dependence in the hadronic wavefunction in order to derive more exact prediction to the pion form factor .",
    "the combined results for the pion form factors @xmath13 are shown in fig.[total ] , where for comparison , the experimental data @xcite and the well - known asymptotic behavior for the leading twist pion form factor have also been shown .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we have constructed a new model wavefunction for @xmath3 based on the moment calculation by using the qcd sum rule approach , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are gegenbauer polynomials and the coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be determined by the da moments .",
    "it has a better end - point behavior than that of the asymptotic one and its moments are consistent with the qcd sum rule results .",
    "although its moments are slightly different from that of the asymptotic da , its better end - point behavior will cure the end - point singularity of the hard scattering amplitude and its contribution will not be overestimated at all .    with this model wavefunction , by keeping the @xmath0 dependence in the wavefunction and taking the sudakov effects and the threshold effects into account ,",
    "we have carefully studied the twist-3 contributions to the pion form factor within the modified pqcd approach , where the model dependence of @xmath3 has also been given .",
    "it has been shown that the present model of @xmath3 can give the right power behavior for the twist-3 contribution .",
    "this behavior is quite different from the previous observations , where the authors concluded that the twist-3 contribution to the pion form factor is comparable or even larger than that of the leading twist in a wide intermediate energy region up to @xmath20",
    ". the higher helicity components @xmath21 in the twist-3 wavefunction have also been considered and it will give a further suppression to the contribution from the usual helicity components @xmath22 , and at @xmath23 , it will give @xmath24 suppression .",
    "we have shown that both the higher helicity structure and twist-3 s contributions are @xmath7-suppressed to the pion form factor .",
    "the @xmath0 factorization approach , where the transverse momentum dependence in the wavefunction and the hard scattering kernel have been kept , ensures these two are really power suppressed . and both two can give sizeable contributions in the intermediate energy regions .    in fig.[combine ] , we show the combined hard contributions for pion form factor , where the higher helicity components have been included in both the twist-2 and the twit-3 wavefunctions , and the twist-3 contribution has been calculated with the present model wavefunction for @xmath3 with @xmath25 .",
    "together with the nlo corrections to the twist-2 contributions , which for the asymptotic da , with the renormalization scale @xmath26 and the factorization scale @xmath27 taken to be @xmath28 , can roughly be taken as@xcite , @xmath29 , one may find that the combined total hard contribution do not exceed and will reach the present experimental data .",
    "there is still a room for other power corrections , such as the higher fock states contributions , soft contributions etc .. finally , we will conclude that there is no any problem with applying the pqcd theory including all power corrections to the exclusive processes at @xmath30 a few @xmath31 .",
    "a 12 gev upgrade to cebaf will offer the possibility to measure pion form factor to good precision out to @xmath32 .",
    "this offers the possibility to study the transition between the dominance of ` soft ' and ` hard ' processes in the dynamics , and to learn where the pqcd limit may be reached , and also to check the pqcd results .",
