    "<S> we calculate the free volume distributions of nearly jammed packings of monodisperse and bidisperse hard sphere configurations . these distributions differ qualitatively from those of the fluid , displaying a power law tail at large free volumes , which constitutes a distinct signature of nearly jammed configurations , persisting for moderate degrees of decompression . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce and explain the observed distribution by considering the pair correlation function within the first coordination shell for jammed hard sphere configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze features of the equation of state near jamming , and discuss the significance of observed asphericities of the free volumes to the equation of state .        </S>",
    "<S> disordered , structurally arrested forms of matter arise through a variety of procesess , such as the glass transition in dense , cold liquids , gelation , jamming in granular matter , to name a few examples@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of these processes and their interrelation are topics of considerable current research activity . </S>",
    "<S> much of the interest is focussed on understanding the manner in which the relaxation dynamics and transport properties change in the fluid state upon approaching the arrest transition . </S>",
    "<S> temperature , density and applied stress are involved as control parameters that determine the transition from an arrested to a fluid state in different systems , and a unified _ jamming phase diagram _ has been discussed as a possible description of the arrested - to - fluid transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical work , however , draws a distinction between the glass and jamming transitions ( summarized , _ </S>",
    "<S> e. g. _ in @xcite ) , and the exact relationship between these transitions is a topic of ongoing research .    </S>",
    "<S> considerable work addressing the nature of the jamming transition has focussed on packings of hard spheres , dating back to the seminal work of bernal and co - workers @xcite , who identified a _ random close packing _ </S>",
    "<S> ( rcp ) of spheres with a packing fraction of @xmath0 , attained as the maximum density for amorphous packings of equal sized spheres . considering the hard sphere fluid as the initial , thermodynamic equilibrium state from which jammed configurations are generated , </S>",
    "<S> rcp would represent a limit state at which the pressure would diverge . </S>",
    "<S> while such a point would correspond to a state of structural arrest , many studies suggest that a _ glass _ transition precedes jamming , at finite pressure @xcite . further , in analogy with the glass transition , </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested and demonstrated that the jamming transition too does not occur at a unique point but can occur over a range of densities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to such analyses concerned with thermodynamic and dynamic ( or kinetic ) aspects , much attention has been focussed on geometric features of jammed configurations @xcite ( in contrast to the relatively scant attention to structure in the context of glass formation ) . </S>",
    "<S> from such a geometric point of view , the proposal of a unique random close packing has been questioned @xcite , and it has been proposed that a more suitable notion is that of maximally random jammed packings . although the jamming density itself is not unique , interestingly , many geometric features remain robust @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important example is the power law singularity in the pair correlation function near contact , observed in addition to the delta function at contact @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origins and consquences of these unique geometric features are of considerable current interest .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the important ways of characterizing the geometry of hard sphere packings is the distribution of free volumes @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] shows the free volume distribution near jamming for both the monodisperse and bidisperse packings . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a peak at small free volumes , the distribution displays an unexpected power law tail @xmath39 , over eight orders of magnitude of free volumes . for both mono- and ( both components of the ) bidisperse packings , the exponent @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these distributions , which are very different from the extrapolation from the fluid state , do not depend on the jamming density . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that the tail is not due to rattlers . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) , eliminating rattlers from consideration alters the exponent in the power law but does not eliminate the feature . </S>",
    "<S> we also verify that the lubachevsky - stillinger procedure@xcite for generating jammed configurations also produces the power law tail . as supported by results discussed below </S>",
    "<S> , the observed power law tail is thus a structural signature of nearly jammed particle packings .    since the free volume of a sphere </S>",
    "<S> is determined by the location of its neighbors , the power law tail in the free volume distribution may be related to the pair correlation function @xmath41 , which , in addition to a delta function at contact , has a well - studied singularity near contact , @xmath42 @xcite for jammed configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the connection is not straight - forward , since @xmath41 is a two - body property , whereas the free volume of a sphere is a many - body property that depends on the positions of all its neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is reasonable to expect , as indeed generally done , that the contact neighbors bound the ( compact ) free volume of a sphere in slightly decompressed configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that non - contact neighbors may play a role at all is therefore suggested by our surprising finding of a large free volume tail , which we explore . as a preliminary test </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the free volume distribution for groups of spheres each of which has a particualr number of contact neighbors ( we discuss the distribution of contact numbers further below ) . these partial distributions are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , for contact number @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> while for @xmath43 the partial distributions are confined to be small free volume peak , for @xmath44 , one has a substantial contribution in the tail . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the number of contact neighbors plays a crucial role in determining the free volumes , and for contact neighbors less than @xmath45 , the free volumes are significantly distributed in the tail .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show the @xmath41 , which exhibits a power law regime near contact with exponent value @xmath46 for monodisperse packings and @xmath47 for component 1 of the bidisperse case . as discussed previously @xcite , and </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] , the @xmath41 exponent depends whether rattlers are included in its evaluation or not . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze configurations which include rattlers , and choose the distance at which @xmath41 deviates from the power law , @xmath48 , as the cutoff to identify contact neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the number of contact neighbors is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) for the monodisperse case </S>",
    "<S> . interestingly , roughly a third of the spheres have less than @xmath45 contact neighbors , and thus the spheres whose free volumes may contribute to the tail of the distribution is not a negligible fraction .        </S>",
    "<S> we next consider a _ </S>",
    "<S> toy _ </S>",
    "<S> computation wherein the free volume of a sphere in the centre of an icosahedral cluster of spheres is considered . starting with a regular , compact configuration </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath49 spheres on the periphery are displaced according to the distribution of neighbor distances observed for monodisperse packings . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) , the free volume distribution for the _ icosahedron model _ indeed displays a power law tail , with the correct exponent , though it is too simple a model to capture all relevant details accurately , such as the relative amplitudes of the peak and the power law tail . choosing initial neighbor positions arranged in an @xmath50 configuration , rather than an icosahedron , leads to a distribution with different features and a different exponent for its tail , as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the distributions evolve towards those found in the liquid state , but interestingly , the power law tail persists over a finite range of densities .     with @xmath54 ( dashed lines ) with an intersection with the cs eos at @xmath55 . </S>",

    "<S> free volume distributions for nearly jammed sphere packings , and show that they exhibit a characteristic power law tail , which we show is related to the power law singularity in the pair correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the power law tail persists for moderate degrees of decompression and are thus a signature of packing close to jamming . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidence that the deviations of the equation of state close to jamming from the prediction for ideal jammed packings arise from the asphericities of the free volumes in addition to the presence of rattlers . </S>"
