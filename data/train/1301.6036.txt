    "the inset compares the phase diagram for the full fluctuation corrections with separable pseudopotential ( solid black line ) to one obtained using the @xmath64 approximation ( dashed black line ) . ]    as in the solid state , finite range interactions alter the nature of the ferromagnetic transition . at zero effective range and zero temperature ,",
    "the separable and reciprocal forms for the pseudopotential are identical so in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcag ] both magnetic transitions concur with previous studies that employed contact interactions  @xcite .",

    "the fluctuation term is restored , thus reducing the critical interaction strength . in the case of the reciprocal pseudopotential , at large effective range",
    "the rescaled interaction strengths scale as @xmath67 , leading to a suppression of interaction effects and a quenching of the ferromagnetic transition at @xmath68 .",
    "although here the separable and reciprocal pseudopotentials lead to different phase behavior , this regime is not only beyond the effective range approximation where higher order terms would be important , but furthermore in a regime where we will now determine that losses dominate .    in a cold atom gas , to generate the repulsive interaction experimentalists exploit a feshbach resonance between the free atoms in the fermi sea and the bound state of two atoms to generate a positive scattering length . however , as the bound state is necessarily lower in energy there is an instability to pair formation .",

    "however , at negative effective range the losses occur on a time - scale @xmath75 which is significantly shorter than the trap crossing time @xmath76 , so large magnetic domains can not be formed .",
    "to date all fermionic mixtures used in cold atom gas experiments have negative effective ranges so are not suitable for observing magnetic correlations @xcite , however a polar molecule gas with strong dipolar interactions does display large positive effective range @xcite and a positive @xmath77-wave scattering length and so presents an opportunity to observe ferromagnetic phenomena .",
