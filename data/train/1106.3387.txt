    "<S> we find that a repulsive potential of graphene in the presence of a magnetic field has bound states that are peaked inside the barrier with tails extending over @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the magnetic length and landau level(ll ) index . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated how these bound states affect scaling properties of the induced density of filled landau levels of massless dirac fermions . for chiral fermions </S>",
    "<S> we find , in strong coupling regime , that the density inside the repulsive potential can be greater than the value in the absence of the potential while in the weak coupling regime we find negative induced density . </S>",
    "<S> similar results hold also for non - chiral fermions . </S>",
    "<S> as one moves from weak to strong coupling regimes the effective coupling constant between the potential and electrons becomes more repulsive , and then it changes sign and becomes attractive . different power - laws of induced density are found for chiral and non - chiral fermions . </S>"
