    "disentangling the mechanisms underlying the social network evolution is one of social science s unsolved puzzles .",
    "recent advances in research bring us a wide variety of principles and models for the growth of complex networks . in",
    "most works these principles / models are validated from perspectives of macroscopic scaling - laws , such as _ power - law _ degree distribution @xcite , _ attachment kernel _ @xcite and _ clustering coefficient _ as function of node degree @xcite .",
    "anecdotal evidence that preferential attachment is a powerful mechanism underlying the emergence of scale - free property in social networks , where new links are established preferentially to more popular nodes in a network , is ubiquitous .",
    "however it is also evident that the _ preferential attachment _ principle is not able to explain all scaling laws @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "further study in @xcite and @xcite shows that an individual s link formation significantly relies on its neighbors .",
    "the principle of _ triadic closure _ has been empirically demonstrated to be relevant for above three macroscopic scaling laws in the work of @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , expressly or implicitly . to summarize , both preferential attachment and triadic closure are strong force shaping the network dynamics .",
    "the questions is whether they can be balanced and unified in one framework .",
    "tremendous works have been proposed to compare principles in macroscopic level .",
    "however the network evolution drives not only the emergence of macroscopic scaling but also the microscopic behavior .",
    "different from prior research we exploit distinctness of principles from the _ microscopic _ perspective .",
    "the evolution of social network affects individuals in two aspects : 1 ) nodal influence varies over time ; 2 ) new links are attached to existing nodes .",
    "they are highly intertwined .",
    "formation of new links will lead to enhancing a node s influence or prominence , and the increment of node s influence over time will attract more links ( _ preferential attachment @xcite _ ) .",
    "consider twitter as an example : as an individual rises in prominence , he / she generates more followers or links .",
    "likewise a website grows in prominence on the basis of its connections ( _ pagerank _",
    "_ we posit a richer framework in the network evolution analysis and modeling should be capable of describing both of the influence evolution and the link formation mechanism .",
    "this is the central theme of our paper .",
    "_    influence analysis and modeling is a subject focus in social networks .",
    "this includes influence maximization @xcite @xcite , influence selection and quantification @xcite , and influence validation @xcite .",
    "in addition , different influence models @xcite @xcite and centrality measures , such as pagerank @xcite , betweenness , @xcite closeness @xcite , and clustering coefficient @xcite have been used for discovering influential nodes in a network .",
    "these methods are limited as they are not predictive about possible rise to prominence or influence of a node in future , and are also not consistent in their performances across different types of networks .",
    "thus , a fundamental question that we consider in this paper : _ is there a generic approach for the influence analysis and prediction of the prominence of a node ? _    as mentioned , the process of link formation is also an integrated aspect of network evolution . in recent work @xcite , a measure of attractiveness that balanced popularity ( i.e. , _ preferential attachment _ ) and similarity ( i.e. , _ common neighbors _ ) was shown to have a better interpretation of the link formation mechanism .",
    "additionally in the work of liben - nowell and kleinberg @xcite and lichtenwalter et al . @xcite it was observed that there is no single feature that is capable of outperforming uniformly in different networks , and @xcite also developed a supervised learning method that included the different features and outperformed the singular features . while there is a body of work in link prediction @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , there is a paucity of an understanding of the evolutionary processes that guide link formation .",
    "a fundamental question that we consider here is : _ how to develop a coherent model that captures influence evolution to inform link prediction ? _ modeling social networks serves to help us understand how social networks form and evolve .",
    "besides providing approaches for concrete problems , we are more interested to know what is the fundamental principle in social network evolution .",
    "to further study , we ask the question , whether the models developed are transferable from one network to another . that is :",
    "is the model for prominence prediction and link prediction , generic enough to learn from one social network and make a prediction on another social network ? with these rigorous analysis",
    "we unveil that _ triadic closure _ could be identified as one of the fundamental principles in the social network evolution .",
    "our contributions are summarized as follows :    * in section  [ sec_triad_measure ] we discuss two popular principles ( preferential attachment and triadic closure ) and their consequences on the microscopic evolution of social networks .",
    "we develop a framework called * triad position profile * where the trade - offs between two principles are optimized . * in section  [ sec_infer_prominence ] and  [ sec_link_prediction ] we apply our approach for node s prominence prediction and link prediction .",
    "we validate that our framework can interpret the individual influence evolution and the link formation mechanism better than has heretofore been possible . * in section  [ sec_generalization ] the validity of generality",
    "is tested on four real - world networks , which demonstrates that our methodology has a better interpretation of mechanisms underlying network evolution .",
    "overall our work provides microscopic insights about social network evolution with applications ranging from link prediction to inferring the future prominence of an individual node .",
    "in this paper we examine our approaches and perform our analysis on four social networks .",
    "the * condmat * network @xcite is extracted from a stream of 19,464 multi - agent events representing condensed matter physics collaborations from 1995 to 2000 .",
    "based on the * dblp * dataset from @xcite we attach timestamps for each collaboration and choose 3,215 authors who published at least 5 papers .",
    "* enron * dataset @xcite contains information of email communication among 16,922 employees in enron corporate from 2001.1.1 to 2002.3.31 .",
    "the * facebook * dataset is used by viswanath et al .",
    "@xcite , which contains wall - to - wall post relationship among 11,470 users between 2004.10 and 2009.1 .      network evolution is usually reflected in changes of node s prominence and new links formed with the other nodes .",
    "first , the social network evolution impacts the prominence ( social status ) of node ; in addition , the node also affects its local neighbourhood and beyond ( via link formation or link dissolution ) . in order to give insights into the network dynamics , we provide several definitions and formulate two concrete problems for the ease of evaluation and comparison .    on a global level , influential nodes or prominent nodes",
    "have intrinsically higher strength of influence than others due to the network topology . through our study",
    ", we have found that a small number of nodes occupy large portion of network resources .",
    "for example ,",
    "in figure  [ fig_pareto_principle](b ) top 20% ( ranked by pagerank ) nodes occupy about 80% _ pagerank _ influence in dblp network .",
    "this satisfies _ pareto principle _ ( also known as 80 - 20 rule ) @xcite . to better understand and model the effects of network evolution on node s prominence , we partition nodes into two sets _ prominent nodes _ and _ non - prominent nodes_.     +    based on _ pareto principle _",
    ", their definitions are given as follows :    * prominent node * in a network @xmath0 a node @xmath1 is a _ prominent node _ under influence measurement @xmath2 if and only if @xmath3 .",
    "* non - prominent node * in a network @xmath0 , a node @xmath1 is a _ non - prominent node _ under influence measurement @xmath2 if and only if @xmath4 .",
    "in following sections we denote the set of _ prominent nodes _ as @xmath5 and the set of _ non - prominent nodes _ as @xmath6 .    as we postulated , an arguably generic approach for the network evolution analysis should have the predictability of a node s prominence in the future .",
    "therefore we formulate a concrete task , the prominence prediction problem , where we can directly evaluate different approaches and facilitate our findings of the underlying principles .    while the link formation is a closely intertwined process with the changes of node s prominence , which is a negligible part in our analysis . to validate the _ link formation _",
    "mechanism , we employ the link prediction problem as our evaluation metric .",
    "the associated definitions are as follows :    * time - varying network * the time - varying network at time @xmath7 is denoted as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of nodes and @xmath10 is the set of links among nodes , @xmath11 is the set of arriving time of all nodes and @xmath12 is the time log of all links .",
    "* prominence prediction * in a time - varying network @xmath8 the prominence prediction task is , for the set of nodes @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the set of _ prominent nodes _ measured in network @xmath15 . how reliably can we infer whether a node @xmath1 ( @xmath16 ) will belong to the set of @xmath17 ? [ def_prominence_prediction ]    in order to demonstrate the discrimination of different principles , @xmath18 is selected large enough for the node influence evolution .",
    "* link prediction * in a time - varying network @xmath8 , the link prediction task in such network is to predict whether there will be a link between a pair of nodes @xmath19 and @xmath1 at time @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these concrete problems provide us quantitative and microscopic views of network evolution , which also make it convenient for principles comparison .    besides verifying the generality of approaches across two intimately interacted processes of network evolution",
    ", we also study whether the learned predictors can generalize across different domains of social networks for both problems defined above .",
    "this provides us rigorous and empirical views of the network evolution problem .",
    "an important fraction of network dynamics locates in the process of influence evolution .",
    "a generic and effective measurement should be able to infer the influence evolution trend , and aid in predicting the potential prominence of a node in the future .",
    "we first introduce the current state of the art of influence measures and discuss their limitations .",
    "in addition , we validate the fundamental principles associated , and introduce our framework - * triad position profile * which optimizes trade - offs between preferential attachment and triadic closure . finally , based on experiments",
    "we unveil the interactions between the process of influence evolution and the process of link formation , which are well reflected in our framework .",
    "the influence analysis in social networks has been a perennial topic of academic research .",
    "typically these include influence maximization @xcite @xcite , influence selection and quantification @xcite @xcite , and influence validation @xcite .    for influence maximization problem ,",
    "there are quite a few influence diffusion models proposed , such as _ linear threshold model _ and _ weighted cascade model _ in the work of @xcite .",
    "many algorithms are designed to maximize the influence in these diffusion models , such as _ degreediscount _ @xcite and `` _ celf _ '' @xcite . at the same time",
    "many centrality measures are proposed for identifying influential nodes in a network , such as _ degree centrality _ , pagerank @xcite , betweenness @xcite , and closeness @xcite .",
    "in addition , goyal et al .",
    "@xcite studied the problem of learning influence probability of node from a log of user actions .",
    "although these methods are proved to be effective in influence quantification and measurement , they are inherently lack of predictability . first , most of these measures assign a value to each node , which leads to the loss of information ; second , much research has focused on describing the influence at current time - that is , the consequence of influence evolution .",
    "this does not assure their predictability of future prominence . to summarize ,",
    "even though these existing measures of influence degree are good at evaluating consequences of evolution , they have limitations in describing the future of influence evolution .",
    "social influence is a well accepted phenomenon in social networks .",
    "we posit influence of a node , as well as capacity of a node being influenced , is a function of its neighborhood .",
    "thus the future prominence of a node may be a function of the sub - structure surrounding the node at time @xmath7 .",
    "we have several canonical examples to support this proposition .",
    "first , based on the _ pagerank _ heuristic : importance of a node is indicated by the number of connections or links to that node ; second , burt @xcite proposed the concept of _ structural hole _ : a node s success often depends on their access to local bridges .",
    "both of these examples imply that the position of node within a social network is important .",
    "this leads us to investigate the value of a node s position within the local sub - structures and the impact on its future prominence , which inspires the development of our framework .          despite the well known macroscopic scaling in social networks , such as _ power - law _ degree distribution @xcite , _ attachment kernel _ @xcite and _ clustering coefficient _ as function of node degree @xcite , it is undecided whether there is a common mechanism underlying these macroscopic laws @xcite @xcite . with the evidence that the _ preferential attachment _ process @xcite is just one dimension of network evolution ,",
    "much recent research has extended the _ preferential attachment _ principle by local sub - structure evolution rules @xcite @xcite .",
    "@xcite and jin et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that an individual s link formation significantly relies on its neighbors . in the work of @xcite",
    ", granovetter proposed that a `` forbidden '' triad ( left in figure  [ fig_tpp_example ] ) is most unlikely to occur in social networks , which means that the probability of a new link to close `` forbidden '' triad is higher than the probability of link between two randomly selected nodes .",
    "the principle of _ triadic closure _ is demonstrated to be relevant for social network evolution in many works @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "obviously these two principles propose two distinct mechanisms of network evolution and none of them can act as a single origin of network evolution . in preferential attachment new links",
    "are made preferentially to high degree nodes while in triadic closure new links are generated to close `` forbidden '' triad ( figure  [ fig_pa_tc ] ) .",
    "we are interested to know whether there is an effective combination of these two principles .    the principles of _ preferential attachment _ and _ triadic closure _",
    "have been empirically demonstrated to be relevant ( not as a single origin ) for macroscopic scaling laws in the work of @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , expressly or implicitly . as the fact that these principles are underlying the social network macroscopic scaling laws , we are interested to know whether these principles are valid to answer the microscopic problems in social network dynamics , such as _ prominence prediction _ and _ link prediction_. our work is different from the work of @xcite and @xcite , leskovec et al . @xcite",
    "employ _ triadic closure _ to reproduce the observed macroscopic laws of social networks and lou et al .",
    "@xcite investigated how a reciprocal link is developed and how relationships develop into triadic closure .",
    "the effect of _ preferential attachment _ on the influence evolution is obvious and evident . here",
    "we explore the effect of _ triadic closure _ on the influence evolution .",
    "the quantity of _ triadic closure _ ( or structural balance ) is usually defined as below @xcite : @xmath23 where connected triad is the left triad in figure  [ fig_tpp_example ] and closed triad is the right triad in figure  [ fig_tpp_example ] respectively . by studying the sub - networks among prominent or non - prominent nodes , we observe that initially the future prominent nodes sub - network has a lower balance rate than the future non - prominent sub network , while after long enough evolution the prominent sub - network forms a more balanced structure ( figure  [ fig_balance_rate ] ) .",
    "there are several implications :    there exists connections between the _ triadic closure _ and the prominence evolution .",
    "in addition , as discussed above , new links are more likely to form between nodes located in an imbalanced sub - network ;    the initial sub - network where future prominent nodes are located is more imbalanced than that of future non - prominent nodes , position of node can be indicative of its future prominence .    to some extent",
    "this implies the effect of _ triadic closure _ on both the influence evolution and the link formation mechanism .",
    "+     +    as suggested in the principle of _ triadic closure _",
    ", a `` forbidden '' triad is more likely to evolve into a closed triad . for further validation",
    ", we provide the evolution ratio of two types of triads in figure  [ fig_triad_rate ] ( a ) .",
    "we can see that the `` forbidden '' triad ( _ triad 2 _ ) has much higher probability to be a closure triad than the disconnected sub - structure _ triad 1_. this implies , nodes in different triads have different probabilities to develop prominence and new links .",
    "this leads us to an important conclusion : the positions of nodes in sub - structures determine their future orbits in both essential evolution elements : the influence evolution and the link formation .",
    "this observation leads us to develop our method called , the triad position profile , discussed in the next sub - section .      motivated by the above analysis",
    ", we start our investigations from the principle of _ triadic closure_. based upon the principle of _ triadic closure _ , an individual will try to close a `` forbidden '' triad that it has , for example in figure  [ fig_tpp_example ] a `` forbidden '' triad is likely to evolve as a closed triad . see examples of all possible triads in figure  [ fig_triad_example](a ) and figure  [ fig_triad_example](b ) .",
    "the number labeled on the edge describes whether two nodes have relation , for instance ` 1 ' can state that two actors are friends while ` 0 ' means they are non - friends .",
    "+    such kind of triad evolution has very nice characteristics , firstly it leads to the formation of the link , and additionally it also increases the influence of node .",
    "thus , different positions of a node in corresponding triads can be indicative of influence and prominence , as well as link formation analysis .",
    "this satisfies our proposition that the influence evolution and link formation are highly intertwined . as we have discussed above",
    ", the position of node within substructures could provide us insights into the principles underlying the network evolution . to that end , in figure  [ fig_tpp_example1 ]",
    "we enumerate all possible five positions in the triad sub - structures for further study .",
    "we are interested to know that the consequences of preferential attachment and triad closure on the network evolution ; second , we want to validate our proposition made in the above section and seek a solution which optimizes trade - offs between two distinct principles .        based on our discussions above ,",
    "we introduce our framework-_triad position profile _ for the influence evolution analysis .",
    "formally , the _ triad position profile _ is defined as follows :    * triad position profile * _ triad position profile _ for a node @xmath1 , written as @xmath24 , is a vector describing the occurrence frequencies of node @xmath1 in five different positions in three isomorphic substructures .    in order to analyze the generality and effectiveness of existing influence measures and our method , we design an experiment to identify their correlation with node latent prominence . the evidence that our framework combining two principles well will be provided later .",
    "* experimental setup * for a time - varying network at time @xmath7 @xmath15 , we extract the set of nodes whose arriving time is @xmath7 and then compute their influence measures based on the topology of @xmath15 . at time @xmath20 for the network @xmath25 we classify the set of nodes into prominent set @xmath17 and non - prominent set @xmath26 based on the topology of @xmath27 . in order to demonstrate the discrimination of two principles , @xmath18 is selected large enough for the node influence evolution .",
    "as we know when @xmath18 is small the prominence prediction problem will be easy . here",
    "we extract new arriving nodes as our prediction candidates , because existing nodes are well evolved and much easier to predict . in this way we can compare the correlations between these metrics and node s latent prominence quantitatively",
    ", we show the @xmath28-value associated with each feature and their corresponding significance level in table  [ tab_significant ] .     +    : p @xmath29 0.1 ; * * : p @xmath29 0.05 ; * * * : p @xmath29 0.01 , * * * * : p @xmath29 0.001 .    [ tab_significant ]",
    "we observe ( see table  [ tab_significant ] ) that the centrality measures are not performing well in describing a node s future prominence except degree centrality and betweenness ( 1 sigma ) , while several _ tpp _ positions are significantly better in describing a node s latent prominence .",
    "for the _ user influential probability _ measure , the historic information of influence probability does not give a promising partition of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( due to the lack of outside action log we calculate _ user influential probability _ as shown in figure  [ fig_triad_example](c ) , a link construction is considered as an action ) .",
    "we note that , in the experiment the sets of @xmath17 and @xmath26 are labeled by the _ degree centrality _ , however we notice that _ degree centrality _ metric does not have a very significant correlation with node s future prominence .",
    "this implies that the _ preferential attachment _ is not the only dimension in the social network evolution as stated in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "while for the _ tpp _ positions , we have several observations : 1 ) we unfold that different _ tpp _ positions have different ability in describing node s future prominence ; 2 ) three of _ tpp _ positions are much better than centrality measures .",
    "these observations hold for other datasets used in our work .",
    "to * summarize * , even though the centrality measures of influence degree are proved to be good at influence quantification , they are inherently not powerful enough to depict the node s future prominence .",
    "additionally we can observe that the triad position profile combines two principles .",
    "triad position @xmath30 and @xmath31 reflect the effect of preferential attachment , while triad position @xmath32 follows the triadic closure principle .",
    "this confirms our propositions made above and the effectiveness of our framework will be further validated .    as _",
    "triadic closure _ principle suggests , for the unclosed triad ( _ triad @xmath33 _ ) new links are formed between nodes in position @xmath32 , however we have observed that nodes in position @xmath31 is more likely to be prominent in future .",
    "one possible reason underlying such phenomenon is the _ preferential attachment _ principle , nodes in position @xmath31 have higher attractiveness of links . however in table  [ tab_significant ] we observe that _ degree centrality _ does not have a comparable significance as the position @xmath31 , this suggests that the _ preferential attachment _ principle is not the only mechanism underlying this .",
    "to further study this effect , we calculated the conditional probability of position @xmath32 and position @xmath31 , @xmath34 states the probability that a node shows up in position @xmath32 given the condition that it is located in position @xmath31 ; @xmath35 is the probability that a node is located in position @xmath31 given the condition that it is also in position @xmath32 .",
    "we can see in figure  [ fig_triad_rate](c ) that nodes in position @xmath31 have extremely high probability to be located in position @xmath32 ( close to 1.0 ) , while nodes in position @xmath32 have less than @xmath36 probability to occur in position @xmath31 .",
    "this means , nodes in position @xmath31 are affected by both mechanisms of _ preferential attachment _ and _ triadic closure _ , while nodes in position @xmath32 are mainly influenced by the _",
    "triadic closure _ principle .",
    "this explains why position @xmath31 has higher significance level than position @xmath32 , and further confirms that the _ triadic closure _ principle is more significant than the _ preferential attachment _ in social networks evolution .",
    "also this implies an * important * characteristic of the _ tpp _ method , the position profile combines two well know social principles ( i.e. _ preferential attachment _ and _ triadic closure _ ) .",
    "as we conjectured in section  [ sec_intro ] , the influence evolution and the link formation are intertwined , and here we provide a detailed investigation into this from the perspective of influence events .",
    "goyal et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the concept of user influential probability that captures the influence degrees from the historic log of user actions .",
    "however such user actions are not always available in networks , here we define an action called _ link action _ between two nodes @xmath19 and @xmath1 as follows :    for a given node @xmath19 in the time - varying network @xmath37 , @xmath19 is said to have a * link action * on node @xmath38 at time @xmath7 if @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "additionally we provide the definition of the _ link influence _ of node @xmath19 on its neighbor @xmath1 as follows :    a node @xmath19 is said to have a * link influence * on its neighbor @xmath1 _ iff _ : 1 ) there is a link action of node @xmath19 with another node @xmath38 at time @xmath7 ; 2 ) there exists a link action of node @xmath1 with node @xmath38 at time @xmath41 ; 3 ) @xmath42 and @xmath43    the @xmath44 is the average action delay between two nodes @xmath19 and @xmath1 .",
    "an example of _ link influence _ is presented in figure  [ fig_triad_event ] ( left ) .        in our work",
    "we divide nodes into two groups ( prominent nodes and non prominent nodes ) , in this section we further study the connection between the node s prominence and the link formation . thus in figure  [ fig_triad_event ] we partition the _ link influence _",
    "event into @xmath45 categories based on nodes prominence .",
    "the three digits represent the prominence status of the three nodes , @xmath19 , @xmath1 , and @xmath38 , ` 1 ' indicates prominent node and ` 0 ' indicates non prominent node . in table",
    "[ tab_triad_event_stat ] we provide the distribution of several patterns , and we observe that : 1 ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 , this means prominent nodes have much higher probability to have _ link influence _ on their neighbors , and it also validates the principle of _ preferential attachment _ ; 2 ) additionally @xmath48 , non - prominent nodes play an important role to transfer _ link influence _ ; 3 ) @xmath49 , this states that _ link influence _",
    "is more likely to happen between prominent nodes ; 4 ) @xmath50 , if _ link influence _ occurs among prominent nodes and non - prominent nodes , then prominent nodes and non - prominent nodes have the same chance to initiate the influence .",
    "to * summarize * , this validates the intimate interactions between the influence evolution and the link formation .",
    "thus we postulate to validate the effectiveness of our framework in these two microscopic problems .",
    "in order to prove the correctness of our framework , we apply our approach in prominent prediction problem and compare with baseline methods . note that we classified nodes as pn or npn , thus making it a binary classification task .",
    "we first discuss the feature vector construction aspect .",
    "we first integrate the various measures capturing the notion of influence in to one feature vector .",
    "in addition to the different measures described in table  [ tab_significant ] ( other than tpps ) , we also include some measures introduced in burt s work of @xcite , such as _ efficiency _ , _ constraint _ and _ hierarchy_. these features contribute to the feature vector for the * baseline * method .",
    "the five tpp positions census contributes to our * tpp * method for prediction . in addition",
    ", we developed a method based on triad substructure influence census ( * tpp+ * ) , as follows .",
    "we first compute the _ link influence probability _ of a node @xmath19 , which can be expressed as @xmath51    in figure  [ fig_triad_event ] we can see that a node @xmath19 with high _ lip _ is more likely to attract links for its neighbors .",
    "our heuristic is , if a node has large number of connections with high _ lip _ nodes then it has higher probability to be prominent in future .",
    "based on this heuristic we design two features to describe a node s prominence trend : @xmath52 thus , tpp+ comprises of tpp , as well as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the features for _ baseline _ method , _ tpp _ and _ tpp+ _ are listed in table  [ table_feature_list ] .",
    "for all methods , we use bagging with _ logistic regression _ as the supervised learning model .",
    "our goal here is to evaluate the utility of additional information imputed by us in the feature vector versus the quality of a learning algorithm .",
    "we conjecture that the benefits of another learning algorithm may uniformly apply to the task , and provide improvements across the board .      in our experiment",
    "we only allow methods to observe features of nodes in a short duration after nodes arriving , for example , for condmat and dblp we only use the first year data of new arriving nodes and for enron and facebook we only use the first month data of new arriving nodes .",
    "we classify the nodes in to pn and npn using _ degree centrality_.",
    "+   +        in table  [ performance_metric1 ] , we provide an empirical comparison of learning performance . in our observation our approach _",
    "tpp_+ outperforms the _ baseline _ method in terms of _ aupr _ and _ top@50 _ , and has better or comparable performance in terms of _ auc _ and _ accuracy_. the _ tpp_+ improves _ aupr _ by 0.7%-16.4% and improves _",
    "top@50 _ by 0%-42.8% .",
    "this confirms that our approach has generalized performance in different domains of datasets .",
    "the performance of _ tpp _ is provided in section  [ sec_generalization ] , which is also better than the _ baseline _ method .",
    "we have several * conclusions * : 1 ) the principle _ preferential attachment _ is just one dimension of mechanisms underlying the nodal influence evolution ; 2 ) the trade - offs between _ triadic closure _ and _ preferential attachment _ are well balanced in _ triad position profile _ and then it achieves better performance in prediction task .",
    "there are different centrality and influence measures for evaluating the prediction of a node s prominence , and it is not possible to enumerate performance across each of those dimensions . to resolve that and do a robust evaluation",
    ", we used the influence propagation models for further validation .    in the prominence prediction problem ,",
    "our task is to predict whether the set of nodes arriving at time @xmath7 ( denoted as * nan * ( new arriving nodes ) ) will become prominent at time @xmath55 .",
    "the prominence predictors will rank the nodes in * nan * based on their likelihoods of being prominent in the future .",

    "we employ the _ degreediscount _ @xcite ( an efficient and scalable algorithm in influence maximization ) to identify the top @xmath56 seed set from the set * nan * based on the topology of network @xmath15 , this top @xmath56 seed set is denoted as @xmath57 .",
    "if the seed set extracted from a prominence predictor results has better influence spread than @xmath57 , then we consider this predictor owns predictability in dynamic influence maximization .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_degree_exp ] , our approach still outperforms the _ baseline _ method . in datasets",
    "dblp , enron and facebook , our approach reveals its predictability in dynamic influence maximization , while in condmat the @xmath18 is too short thus the benefit of predictability is not significant . to note that , our method is not designed for the purpose of influence maximization , the comparisons in influence propagation model are employed to provide an empirical and solid comparison between _ baseline _ method and _ tpp_+ .",
    "as we discussed above , the influence evolution and the link formation / dissolution are intimately connected . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that our framework can also interpret the link formation process better than has heretofore been possible .        motivated by our discussion in section  [ sec_balance_theory ] and section  [ sec_influence_event ] , here we introduce a method called _ triad evolution matrix ( tem ) _ , which are adapted from triad position profile to perform the link prediction task .",
    "all possible 3-subgraph in an undirected network is presented in figure  [ fig_triads ] ( a ) , and their transition relationships are provided in figure  [ fig_triads ] ( b ) .",
    "based on our observations in section  [ sec_balance_theory ] different kinds of triads have different probabilities to be closure triad , this inspires us to perform the census of nodes pair s collocation in these triads and gain discernment in predicting new links .",
    "+     +    the tem is a matrix of size @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , where n is the number of triads in undirected networks , and tem@xmath60 $ ] represents the percentage of triad-@xmath61 at time @xmath7 evolve to triad-@xmath62 at time @xmath63 ( figure  [ fig_triads_evolution_matrix ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this matrix can be computed trivially by counting triads in the network @xmath15 at time @xmath7 and then calculating elements by checking the network @xmath64 at time @xmath63 . additionally in the network @xmath65 there are four possible _ triad collocation elements _ ( figure  [ fig_triads_evolution_matrix ] ( b ) ) for two nodes @xmath66 and @xmath7 where @xmath67 .",
    "thus for any two nodes @xmath66 and @xmath7 collocated in tce@xmath68 ( _ triad collocation elements _ ) ( @xmath69 ) , we can compute the likelihood of potential link between @xmath66 and @xmath7 as below : @xmath70 \\text { if } i=0 \\\\ & ( 0,0,\\frac{1}{2},1 ) \\cdot tem[1 , . ]",
    "\\text { if } i=1,2 \\\\ & ( 0,0,0,1 ) \\cdot tem[2 , . ]",
    "\\text { if } i=3 \\end{cases } \\end{split}\\ ] ] in this way we get a likelihood vector for tce , @xmath71    to note that here we are using the dot product of two vectors of size 4 , the result will be a real number . and the case that two nodes @xmath66 and @xmath7 are collocated in tce@xmath72 is equivalent to the case that they are collocated in tce@xmath73 for undirected link prediction .",
    "thus for two nodes @xmath66 and @xmath7 we can calculate a probability vector based on the corresponding tce vector , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 states for how many tce@xmath68 elements nodes @xmath66 and @xmath7 are collocated in .",
    "the corresponding probabilities vector @xmath76 can be written as : @xmath77 \\cdot l[0 ] , tce_{s , t}[1 ] \\cdot l[1 ] , \\\\",
    "tce_{s , t}[2 ] \\cdot l[2 ] , tce_{s , t}[3 ] \\cdot l[3 ] ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] in this way this vector gives a multi - dimensional description of the link likelihood of a pair of nodes @xmath66 and @xmath7 based on the principle of _ triadic closure _ , and which also balances well with the _ preferential attachment_.      as we discussed in section  [ sec_infer_prominence ] , we can calculate the _ lip _ for a individual node using the census of _ link influence_. similarly , we can compute the _",
    "lip _ of a node @xmath19 on its neighbor @xmath1 , as follows : @xmath78 thus for a pair of nodes @xmath1 and @xmath38 , we can calculate their link likelihood based on our observed @xmath79 information and most recent link actions within @xmath80 time .",
    "firstly for the common neighbor node @xmath19 of @xmath1 and @xmath38 , we need to calculate the probability of link between @xmath1 and @xmath38 due to the influence of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath81    in the above equations , @xmath82 represents the probability of link between @xmath1 and @xmath38 due to the influence probability of @xmath19 on @xmath1 , while @xmath83 represents the probability of link between @xmath1 and @xmath38 due to the influence probability of @xmath19 on @xmath38 .",
    "trivially , we can use the maximum value of them to represent the probability of link between @xmath1 and @xmath38 due to the node @xmath19 , denoted as @xmath84 . and for a pair of nodes @xmath1 and @xmath38 there can exist many common neighbors , thus we define the probability of link between @xmath1 and @xmath38 due to the link influence effect as follows : @xmath85    [ table_feature_list1 ]    [ tab_lp_results ]     +   +          * experimental setup * we set the default values for classifiers used in this paper , 10 bags of 10 random forest trees for hplp ( the same setting in the work of  @xcite ) , 10 bags of 10 _ logistic regression _ for tem- , tem and tem+ .",
    "the features lists of all models are presented in table  [ table_feature_list1 ] .",
    "tem method combines @xmath86 and @xmath87 into the features vector , which includes the nodes pair collocation information and triad evolution information learned from historical data . in tem+",
    "we include one more feature ( _ link influence probability _ ) than the tem , this feature is introduced in equation  [ eqn_lp ] . while tem- only includes the nodes pair collocation information described by @xmath86 , where only static topological information are included . in this way",
    "we can investigate the generality of @xmath87 and _ link influence probability_. the performance of tem- can be found in table  [ table_general_across_lp ] .",
    "the reason we select hplp for comparison is , hplp includes almost all centrality measures frequently used in link analysis and it is also the best framework of feature - based link prediction till date .",
    "another reason is , the hplp method can be considered as a naive combination of preferential attachment and triadic closure , where the values of preferential attachment and common neighbors are simply combined into one feature vector .",
    "we undersample training set to 30% positive class prevalence in training .",
    "we do not change the size or distribution of the testing data .",
    "in this paper , we restricted the prediction task within the set of two hops node pairs @xcite .    in table  [ tab_lp_results ]",
    "we present the performance comparisons of our methods with hplp @xcite and state - of - art methods listed in @xcite ( _ adamic / adar _ , _ common neighbors _ and _ preferential attachment _ ) .",
    "as suggested in the work @xcite , given the high class imbalance , area under the precision - recall curve ( aupr ) should be used as the primary evaluation measure .",
    "we can see that the tem+ and tem method significantly outperforms the hplp method by at most 121% in terms of aupr .",
    "we observe almost the same pattern in section  [ sec_infer_prominence ] .",
    "thus , the position profile methodology is consistently effective for both the prominence prediction and link prediction .",
    "additionally we find that our framework ( tem+ and tem ) are better than pa , cn and aa methods .",
    "this implies that the combination of preferential attachment and triadic closure is better than each of them alone .    to be rigorous , in figure  [ fig_lp_performance ] we also provide roc curves and pr curves for three methods , tem , hplp and pa .",
    "hplp includes almost all classical predictors frequently used in link analysis , which can be considered as a naive combination of _ preferential attachment _",
    "( i.e. , pa ) and _ triadic closure _",
    "( i.e. , common neighbors and adamic / adar ) .",
    "we observe that : 1 ) tem method outperforms pa method significantly in terms of roc curve and pr curve , which means _",
    "preferential attachment _ is not the single origin underlying the process of link prediction ; 2 ) hplp method outperforms pa method in all cases , which indicates that both preferential attachment and triadic closure are not negligible in network evolution ; 3 ) tem method is better than hplp method , which means tem successfully optimizes certain trade - offs between _ preferential attachment _ and _ triadic closure_. all of these results demonstrate the strength of our framework in predicting new links .",
    "in the above sections we have demonstrated that the _ triad position profile _ has a stronger generalization capacity than nodal attributes based methods in predicting future prominent nodes and predicting new links . to be rigorous ,",
    "we now ask : are these features powerful enough to transfer learning from one social network to another ?",
    "if our framework are able to generalize across datasets , then it will further demonstrate that our framework captures the essential principles of network evolution .",
    "[ table_general_across ]    [ table_general_across_lp ]      we first consider the prominence prediction problem . in table",
    "[ table_general_across ] , we provide the transferred learning results for _ baseline _ model and _ tpp _ model . each pair of generalization is trained on the row dataset and evaluated on the column dataset by bagging with _ logistic regression _ , as before .",
    "the diagonal entries represent the performance of models which are trained and tested on the same dataset , which makes it convenient for comparisons .",
    "there are several observations .",
    "first , we find that few generalization entries have higher performance than their corresponding non - generalization entries ( diagonal entries ) , for example two increased entries of _ tpp _ belong to the generalization from enron and facebook to dblp .",
    "second , we observe that the _ tpp _ model s performance degrades remarkably less than the _ baseline _ model in most cases .",
    "this indicates that the position profile of node captures principles that are more generic than the centrality based model , and this still holds even if the generalization is across different domains of networks .",
    "third , the generalization of the position profile methodology is not significantly impacted by the fact that the difficulty of prediction is different across the network domains and the fact that the imbalance ratio between training set size and testing set size : for example , prominence prediction is more difficult on dblp dataset , however the models learned on dblp still have performance that are comparable to the corresponding diagonal entries ; additionally even if dblp training set size is only around 100 , it can still work well on the testing sets of condmat , enron and facebook , which are up to thousands .",
    "fourth , the difficulty of prediction in each dataset is not affected by the generalization : all performances in the same column are in the same order of magnitude .",
    "additionally , by comparing the performance of _ tpp _ and _ tpp_+ we can see the _ tpp _ method is more stable in the generalization across datasets ; the reason is trivial , the _ tpp_+ contains two feature ( _ prominence_prob _ and _ prominence_index _ ) which are not that generic across different domains of datasets .",
    "this further confirms that the position profile is a general cross - domain property for the influence evolution analysis .    in conclusion ,",
    "the position profile based model is notably more generic across different domains of networks , and the centrality based model is more particular to a specific dataset .      as discussed before ,",
    "the link formation and influence evolution are always accompanied with each other .",
    "we also conducted an empirical generalization of the link prediction task across different datasets in table  [ table_general_across_lp ] . to note that , in order to have fair comparison , we use 10 bags of logistic regression for all methods .",
    "most of our observations made in the generalization of prominence prediction still hold for the link prediction problem .",
    "first , this validates the intimate interactions between the influence evolution and the link formation mechanisms ; we see the same overall pattern . for example , both _ baseline _ and _ hplp _ have large drops in performance when generalizing from facebook to condmat and generalizing from facebook to enron .",
    "second , this suggests that the properties captured by the position profile ( in both problems ) are indeed general across datasets .    in conclusion based on the generalization of the prominence prediction problem and the link prediction problem across datasets",
    ", we postulate that the positions where nodes are located are more significant in determining their evolution orbits than the nodal attributes possessed by them .",
    "our methodology of position profile has a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible in depicting the network evolution .",
    "this is due to the optimized trade - offs between _ triadic closure _ and _ preferential attachment _ in our triad position profile methodology .",
    "in this paper we analyzed several principles / mechanisms underlying the network evolution , mainly focused on two essential elements of the network evolution : the individual influence evolution and the link formation / dissolution mechanism .",
    "we demonstrated that position of a node in a local structure is strongly indicative of the influence progression or future prominence of the node in the social network . building on this observation",
    ", we developed a prominence prediction method as well as a method for link prediction .",
    "we showed that the node prominence and the process of link formation are closely intertwined and impact the evolution of a network .",
    "we empirically demonstrated the improvement in performance over the baseline methods for both prominence prediction and link prediction across the four different datasets .",
    "we further established the generalization capacity of our methods under a transfer learning scenario  we learned the classifier on one social network ( using the proposed features ) and tested on another social network .",
    "the performance trends clearly showed that our approach is able to capture essential properties or features underlying network evolution , which are general across different domains of social networks .",
    "these findings are important for several reasons .",
    "first , it provides microscopic evidence that the _ triadic closure _ is a fundamental principle underlying the social network evolution .",
    "second , our methodology ( triad position profile ) is validated to optimize trade - offs between essential dimensions of network evolution ( _ preferential attachment _ and _ triadic closure _ ) , then it is not surprising that , as a consequence , our approach yields accurate and generic performance in both microscopic problems . in summary",
    ", we have developed a new perspective for network evolution and developed a general purpose feature vector that can be used by different machine learning algorithms across different social networks .",
