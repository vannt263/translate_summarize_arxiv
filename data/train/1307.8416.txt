    "the gutzwiller variational wavefunction@xcite ( gvw ) has been an important tool in the analysis of various correlated quantum systems , ranging from ferromagnets @xcite to ultracold bosonic gases@xcite , to superconductors@xcite ( the so - called gutzwiller - correlated bcs wave function ) .",
    "in fact , in some cases  such as transition metals  , its success in determining the dispersion of quasi - particle excitations has been confirmed experimentally by angle - resolved photoemission experiments@xcite and de haas - van alphen data.@xcite    more recently , the concept of matrix product states@xcite ( mpss ) has shedded new light on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm developed by white,@xcite which is very successful in describing the ground state properties of strongly interacting local hamiltonians in one dimension .",
    "indeed , if we do quantum mechanics in the restricted state class provided by matrix product states , dmrg and other methods almost force themselves on us.@xcite mpss are not merely a convenient reformulation of white algorithm .",
    "in fact , they turn out to be a theoretical framework that allows for extensions and generalizations that would be too cumbersome to formulate within the old language of dmrg . for instance",
    ", dmrg suffers from severe limitations when extended to dimensions larger than one,@xcite although attempts in this direction have been explored with the so - called projected entangled pair states ( peps),@xcite a simple generalization of mpss.@xcite    in this paper , we first note that the grand - canonical and number - conserving gutzwiller anstze are in fact the zero - order approximation of an expansion in the truncation parameter of a mps .",
    "we use this simple but nontrivial observation in two different ways .",
    "first , we show that at essentially the same computational cost , a number - conserving gvw is less efficient in capturing the ground state of a quantum system than a more general mps with comparable _ link dimension _ , _",
    "i.e. _ with essentially the same number of variational parameters . second , we propose a corrected time - dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm@xcite ( tdmrg ) that conserves exactly the expectation value of the number of particles when a gvw or a mps are not explicitly number - conserving .    whereas the time - dependent gutzwiller ansatz has been used several times in the literature,@xcite to our knowledge no explicit algorithm that allows for the _ exact _ conservation of the number of particles has ever been described , and this prevents the comparison between the gvw dynamics and ( quasi)-exact tdmrg simulations , which we can now provide in this work .",
    "moreover , our algorithm works in _ any dimension _ for the gvw , and in one dimension for general mpss that do not explicitly conserve the particle number or other conserved quantities corresponding to abelian symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "our algorithm can find applications in the study of correlated effects in quantum systems in dimension one and higher , both as a simple starting point and as a yard stick for more refined calculations .",
    "indeed , the gvw is a variational mean - field wavefunction , and it is expected to work even better with increasing dimension .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we recall the definition and properties of matrix product states , and how the use of symmetries greatly simplifies their computation . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we show explicitly that the gvw is nothing other than a zero - order mps .",
    "in addition , we answer in the affirmative the question of whether it exists a mps with a smaller link dimension that , at the same computational cost , better captures the ground state wavefunction than a number - conserving gvw in 1d . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we propose a novel number - conserving time - dependent gutzwiller ansatz , and show that it compares very well with the exact dynamics using tdmrg in 1d .",
    "the algorithm is not limited to the gvw but is in fact a corrected version of tdmrg that can be applied to general mpss that do not explicitly conserve the number of particles .",
    "we provide a detail description of the algorithm only for the gvw since the corresponding more general version for mpss is simply notationally more involved .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "although not limited to this case , in the following we consider a quantum system defined on a open lattice of length @xmath1 where the lattice site @xmath2 can be occupied by a number @xmath3 of bosons . the hamiltonian is assumed to be the sum of nearest - neighbor terms which globally conserve the total number of particles @xmath4 .",

    "this class of states can be easily dealt with the usual methods of dmrg.@xcite an important observation is that particle number conservation alone has the nontrivial effect of increasing the amount of entanglement of the trial wavefunction . for a @xmath69gwv @xmath59 for all links and",

    "this implies that a @xmath51gvw is computationally more expensive than a @xmath69gvw .",
    "an interesting question is then if a more general mps  where the degeneracies @xmath39 of the symmetry multiplets are not bounded ( @xmath72 )  can better capture the ground - state wavefunction at a _ comparable _ computational cost , where the computational cost of a mps is roughly quantified by the link dimension @xmath19 . in the following",
    ", we will indeed show that the answer is affirmative .    to show this explicitely",

    "the corresponding data for the link dimensions @xmath19 for the trial wavefunction shows that the @xmath51gvw is in fact as computationally difficult to calculate as a mps with a discarded weight as large as @xmath80 ( quite a poor value for current dmrg standards ) and much better results can be obtained with the latter since it has a much lower energy ( see fig .

    "<S> the gutzwiller variational wavefunction ( gvw ) is commonly employed to capture correlation effects in condensed matter systems such as ferromagnets , ultracold bosonic gases , correlated superconductors , etc . by noticing that the grand - canonical and number - conserving gutzwiller anstze are in fact the zero - order approximation of an expansion in the truncation parameter @xmath0 of a matrix product state ( mps ) </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that mpss , and the algorithms used to operate on them , are not only flexible computational tools but also a unifying theoretical framework that can be used to generalize and improve on the gvw . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we show that a number - conserving gvw is less efficient in capturing the ground state of a quantum system than a more general mps which can be optimized with comparable computational resources . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we suggest a corrected time - dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm that ensures the conservation of the expectation value of the number of particles when a gvw or a mps are not explicitly number - conserving . </S>",
    "<S> the gvw dynamics obtained with our algorithm compares very well with the exact one in 1d . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the algorithm works in any dimension for a gvw . </S>",
    "<S> we thus expect it to be of great value in the study of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems . </S>"
