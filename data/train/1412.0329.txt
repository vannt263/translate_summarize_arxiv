    "because of its proximity ( d=16 mpc , translating to a projected scale of about 80 pc per arcsec ) and high surface brightness from radio through x - rays , studies of its jet emission can be undertaken at the highest resolutions in more wavebands than any other object .",

    "we did not see month time scale flux variability in the nucleus because the observations were taken every 4 - 6 months , but the small increase in flux in mid-2007 may have been caused due to flaring activity of nucleus .",
    "the total flux versus time plot for hst-1 showed its flaring activity .",
    "the brightness of the knot gradually increased from late 2002 and was at its peak brightness in mid-2005 .",
    "after that there was a rapid decrease in its brightness and no other flare or variability was observed during the remaining time of observations until early 2008 .",
    "the observed increase in radio flux was relatively smaller as compared to the optical where the increase was a factor of 100 .",
