    "the mass density of the universe is dominated by exotic dark matter whose identity remains unknown .",
    "important clues could be hidden in the structure of the dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way which are the most dark matter dominated systems known in the universe .",
    "it has recently been found that these galaxies all seem to have approximately the same central density ( within 300 or 600  pc ) , irrespective of their luminosity @xcite .",
    "there thus appears to be a special scale or threshold involved in the formation of dwarf satellites .",
    "a threshold central density could arise naturally if there is a cutoff in the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations produced by free - streaming of warm dark matter particles in the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , if the dark matter is cold , then there are no primordial processes that operate on the relevant scales . in this case the origin of the threshold must be a late - time astrophysical process that inhibits star formation in small dark matter haloes , such as the reionisation of gas at early times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by suppressing star formation in small cold dark matter haloes , early reionisation would also solve the ` missing satellite ' problem @xcite , as demonstrated using semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have confirmed , also with semi - analytic techniques , that this process sets the common mass scale seen in the inner 300 ( or 600 ) pc of dwarf satellite haloes .",
    "one problem with the work of @xcite and @xcite , however , is that they modelled reionisation using the filtering mass approach of @xcite which has been shown to overestimate the importance of this effect @xcite .",
    "since the reionisation of gas at early times and its effects on star formation are complex processes , full hydrodynamic simulations are required to determine how they influence the structure and evolution of dwarf galaxies . in this letter",

    ", we focus on the physical processes that determine whether or not a subhalo is able to form a galaxy and on the inner structure of the resulting object .",
    "we study the satellite population that formed in a high - resolution resimulation , using full baryonic physics , of ` aquarius - d ' , one of the 6 cold dark matter haloes simulated as part of the ` aquarius ' project by @xcite .",
    "our simulation includes all the gas physics thought to be relevant for galaxy formation : a time - evolving photoionising background @xcite , metallicity - dependent gas cooling and photoheating @xcite , sn feedback @xcite , and chemical evolution due to sne  ii , sne  ia , and agb stars @xcite .",

    "the latter agreement is perhaps not too surprising given that in order to derive values of @xmath26 for the milky way satellites , @xcite adopted a relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 derived from the @xmath29cdm simulation of @xcite .    before examining the physical processes responsible for the result of fig .",

    "the explanation of this apparent paradox is simply that , @xmath24 is numerically more robust than @xmath23 @xcite . to test whether or not @xmath23 has converged in our high resolution simulation , we make use of the empirical relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 derived from the highest resolution aquarius simulation =   0.58\\log[m_{06}/(h^{-1}m_\\odot ) ] - 3.092 $ ] ] ( which has about 100 times better resolution than our high resolution hydrodynamic simulation ; @xcite ) . as shown in fig .",

    "this figure shows a sharp transition in @xmath39 between subhaloes whose descendants go on to make visible galaxies and those whose descendants do not .",
    "surprisingly , this threshold applies not only to luminous satellites , but also to subhaloes that contain only two star particles .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath40 km s@xmath2 and is due to the effects of reionisation : the increase in thermal pressure which follows reionisation evaporates the gas from subthreshold haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , the properties of a satellite are determined by subsequent events .",
    "particularly important is the accretion of the ( sub)halo into the main progenitor of the host galaxy .",
    "the epoch of accretion determines many of the key properties of the final satellite , such as its luminosity and star formation rate .",
    "the key events in the life of a subhalo are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ histories ] .",
    "consider first the evolution of haloes that go on to make visible satellites by the present day , illustrated in panels  ( a ) .",
    "as may be seen in the lower subpanels , at @xmath33 all these haloes have above - threshold maximum circular velocity ( @xmath41 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the gas in these objects , shown by the red line in the upper subpanels , is unaffected by reionisation and these haloes are able to form stars ( blue lines ) .",
    "eventually , however , the halo is accreted into the progenitor halo of the main galaxy , becoming a subhalo . at this time , the remaining gas is stripped completely and star formation ceases .",
    "this explains why most of today s dwarf satellites are old .",
    "although we do not find the correlation between accretion redshift and halo mass at the epoch of accretion reported in the semi - analytic models of @xcite , we do find a correlation between accretion redshift and final satellite luminosity .",
    "the satellite illustrated in the 3rd column has a slightly unusual behaviour .",
    "this object loses its gas well before becoming a subhalo . since",
    "its maximum circular velocity at @xmath45 is just above the critical value , reionisation and photoheating do heat up the gas which becomes loosely bound and is subsequently blown out by supernova explosions and increased background radiation by @xmath46 .",
    "the photoionising background prevents gas from reaccreting into a halo with such small circular velocity @xcite .",
    "panel  ( b ) follows the fate of typical failed satellites , i.e. of haloes that are below the circular velocity threshold at reionisation and are destined to remain as dark subhaloes today .",
    "most of them lose all of their gas by evaporation at @xmath47 .",
    "although they can subsequently gain small amounts of gas as they grow in mass ( and circular velocity ) , the gas density in their shallow potential wells is much too low for stars to form .",
    "the halo illustrated in the rightmost panel has value of @xmath35 which is only just above threshold . as a result , it does not lose its gas immediately after reionisation but holds on to it for some time before finally losing it at @xmath48 .",
    "this object never manages to make stars because the large thermal pressure prevents gas from attaining a sufficiently large density and so the ( sub)halo remains forever dark .",
    "in this letter we have used a high resolution n - body hydrodynamic simulation to investigate the formation histories of the satellites that form in a milky - way type galaxies in a @xmath29cdm universe .",
    "these simulations have been shown to reproduce the main optical and chemical properties of the local group satellites , including their luminosity function @xcite . in this study",
    "we have focused on the properties that distinguish the small subset of subhaloes that succeed in making a galaxy , from the vast majority that remain dark .",
    "our simulations naturally reproduce the observation that the milky way satellites have very similar central densities irrespective of their luminosity .",
    "they also show that there is a threshold circular velocity today , @xmath49 km s@xmath2 , above which all subhaloes present today host satellites with the luminosities typical of the classical satellites of the milky way ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the number of satellites drops rapidly below this critical circular velocity but around this value there are haloes which succeed in making a galaxy and haloes which do not .",
    "the distinction between them can be traced back to the epoch of reionisation when there is a hard threshold in maximum circular velocity , @xmath51 km s@xmath2 , that divides haloes where gas can cool and make stars from haloes in which it can not . the scatter between @xmath24 and @xmath35 that develops over time explains why seemingly similar subhaloes today can have such different mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this key feature can not be explained by the effect of galactic winds alone .",
    "galactic winds in which the wind velocity scales in proportion to velocity dispersion were shown by @xcite to be required to explain the satellite luminosity function .",
    "here we have shown that reionisation is required to explain the circular velocity function .    haloes with sub - threshold @xmath35 lose their gas by evaporation during reionisation while the haloes with above - threshold @xmath35 retain their gas which eventually overcomes the increased thermal pressure produced by reionisation and proceed to make stars .",
    "this explains why @xcite could not find any residual signs of reionisation in the star formation histories of simulated satellites .",
    "if the cdm model is right , a large number of small , completely optically dark subhaloes should be orbiting in the milky way halo .",
    "they might one day be detected indirectly either through annihilation radiation if the dark matter consists of supersymmetric particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or through gravitational lensing effects ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "broadly speaking , our results agree with those obtained using semi - analytic models applied to high - resolution @xmath52-body simulations .",
    "these studies also find that a preferred mass scale arises naturally in dwarf galaxies from a combination of astrophysical processes that inhibit star formation in small haloes and the fact that the mass within 600 pc ( or 300 pc ) is not a very sensitive function of the total subhalo mass @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless surprising that @xcite managed to obtain a correlation between @xmath23 and satellite luminosity similar to ours ( fig .",
    "[ strigari ] ) and to the real data because they assumed an extreme reionisation model which is incompatible with the results of recent simulations @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the minimum mass scale in their model was set by their assumption that gas does not cool in haloes with virial temperature below @xmath53k rather than by the effects of photoionising background .",
    "note that the threshold circular velocity imposed by reionisation in our simulations , @xmath51 km s@xmath2 , corresponds to a virial temperature of @xmath54k .    using a simple analytical model applied to an n - body simulation",
    ", @xcite also finds that a preferred satellite mass scale ( as well as other properties of the satellite system , such as the luminosity function and spatial distribution ) can be explained if the star formation efficiency decreases with decreasing halo mass . in our simulations",
    "a dependence of star formation efficiency on halo mass of this kind is a natural outcome of the behaviour of galactic winds .",
    "kravtsov s model does not assume a sharp threshold in the star formation efficiency .",
    "this , however , arises naturally in our simulations as a result of reionisation and seems to be required in order to explain why some dark matter halos always remain dark .",
    "our simulations ignore the possibilities that gas may be self - shielded against ionising radiation , or that star formation may result from molecular gas cooling before reionisation",
    ". both of these processes could be important in the formation of small objects @xcite and may allow small amounts of star formation in sub - threshold haloes .",
    "it will be particularly interesting to explore how important these effects are for the newly - discovered ultrafaint satellites @xcite .",
    "we leave these issues for future work . our present simulations , however ,",
    "demonstrate that a preferred mass scale in satellites does not require abandoning the standard model of cosmology but is , in fact , a natural byproduct of galaxy formation in small cold dark matter haloes .",
