    "nature is filled with phenomena that exhibit chaotic behavior . in chaotic systems",
    "we can not predict the system s future state exactly  @xcite .",
    "such chaotic behavior has also been found in some relativistic systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , in schwarzschild spacetime , the motions of a spinning test particle can be chaotic  @xcite . if the test particle does not have spin , the motion of the test particle is regular .",
    "they have found that , as the magnitude of the spin increases extremely , the motions switch from regular to chaotic , using the poincar map and the lyapunov exponent . in practice ,",
    "the magnitude of the spin where the particle motion is remarkably chaotic is so large that such a system is not realistic , which has been remarked in the paper  @xcite .",
    "however , this model is important in understanding chaos in general relativistic systems .    in this paper",
    ", we look for statistical laws to characterize the chaos in the motions of the spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "actually , the chaotic motions in this system have been classified merely as chaotic , according to the distribution of the points in poincar maps and positiveness of the lyapunov exponents , but the details of the properties of the chaos have not been clarified  @xcite . once we find chaotic behavior ,",
    "however , we should rather characterize it to extract the specific properties of the system .",
    "indeed , we can hardly learn anything about the chaos if we judge it only from the randomness of the distribution of the points in poincar maps or the positiveness of the lyapunov exponents  @xcite .",
    "not a few people believe that a chaotic system is simply random and completely unpredictable .",
    "it is true that we can not predict the time evolution of the state of the system exactly , when the system is chaotic .",
    "however , we should note that , even in such cases , we can frequently find some statistical laws which are specific to the system . one possible measure of chaos is the power spectrum of the time series of the system .",
    "if the power spectrum is white noise , the time evolution of the system is not time - correlated . in not a few cases , however , the pattern of the power spectrum obeys power laws , so - called @xmath1 fluctuations  @xcite , which can be clearly distinguished from the white - noise type . that the power spectrum obeys some power laws means that the time evolution of the system is time - correlated .",
    "thus we can classify the chaos from the pattern of its power spectrum .",
    "let us explain our strategy to characterize the chaos in the motions of the spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime in this paper . to begin with , we introduce the power spectrum of the time series of @xmath0 components of the particle s position .",
    "next we characterize the properties of the chaos , using the pattern of the power spectrum .",
    "it is found that the pattern of the power spectrum can be classified as @xmath1 or white noise .",
    "that is , we succeed in classifying the chaotic motions into two distinct types .",
    "furthermore , based on this classification , we can plot , in the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath4 , the phase diagram for the properties of the chaos . finally , we detect the origin of the @xmath1 fluctuations of the power spectrum in this system .",
    "we find out that the orbit stagnates around the tori , while traveling back and forth between them , whenever the power spectrum shows @xmath1 spectral pattern .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we shall briefly review the basic equations , i.e. , the equations of motion for a spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime . in sec .",
    "[ sec : poin ] we plot the poincar maps of the chaotic motions in this system .",
    "here we point out a weakness in the poincar maps , which brings a motivation to introduce another method to characterize such chaotic motions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ps ] we introduce the power spectrum to characterize the properties of the chaos in this system .",
    "then we find the pattern of the power spectrum can be classified into two types , @xmath1 and white noise , depending on the values of the system parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : origin ] we detect the origin of the @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussion . throughout this paper",
    "we use units @xmath5",
    "we consider a spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the equations of motions of a spinning test particle in relativistic spacetime have been derived by papapetrou @xcite and then reformulated by dixon @xcite .",
    "the set of equations is given as @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 } , \\label{basic3}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are an affine parameter of the orbit , the four - velocity of a particle , the momentum , and the spin tensor , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 deviates from a geodesic due to the coupling of the riemann tensor with the spin tensor .",
    "we adopt the additional condition formulated by dixon  @xcite , @xmath14 which gives a relation between @xmath13 and @xmath15 , and consistently determines the center of mass of the spinning particle .",
    "the mass of the particle @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 to make clear the freedom of this system , we have to check the conserved quantities .",
    "regardless of the symmetry of the background spacetime , it is easy to show that the mass @xmath16 and the magnitude of spin @xmath3 defined by @xmath18 are constants of motion @xcite .",
    "if a background spacetime possesses some symmetry described by a killing vector @xmath19 , @xmath20 is also conserved  @xcite . because the spacetime we consider in this paper is static and spherically symmetric , there are two killing vector fields , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "from ( [ eqn : killing ] ) , we find the constants of motion related with those killing vectors as @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are interpreted as the energy of the particle and the @xmath0 component of the total angular momentum , respectively . because the spacetime is spherically symmetric , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components of the total angular momentum",
    "are also conserved . in addition , without loss of generality we can choose the @xmath0 axis in the direction of total angular momentum as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . in the following sections , we integrate the above equations of motion numerically for various values of parameters @xmath24 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , using the bulirsch - stoer methods @xcite .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the particle motions in the model formulated in the previous section ( see also @xcite ) using poincar maps as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : poin ] . as mentioned in the paper @xcite , the parameter range of the energy @xmath24 for each fixed parameter set @xmath4",
    "is restricted to enable the particle to move around the black hole without going to infinity or falling into the black hole .",
    "although similar analyses have been already done in the paper @xcite , the analysis in this section motivates us to introduce in the next section another method to characterize the motions .    using poincar map",
    ", we can judge if the motions are chaotic or not . to plot the poincar map ,",
    "we adopt the equatorial plane ( @xmath30 ) as a poincar section and plot the point ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) when the particle crosses the poincar section with @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poin ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] , we plot the poincar maps for the total angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "the values of the spin @xmath3 are set to @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] ( a ) and @xmath36 in fig .  [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) .",
    "each value of the energy @xmath24 is chosen as an appropriate one so that the test particle does not escape to infinity and does not fall into a black hole .",
    "the parameter sets @xmath37 in figs .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) are the same as those in figs . 4 ( e ) and 4 ( f ) in the paper  @xcite . in fig .  [ fig : pmap ] dots with different colors correspond to the data from the orbits with different initial conditions .",
    "if the orbit is chaotic , some of the tori are broken and the poincar map no longer consists of a set of closed curves . both in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] ( a ) and fig .  [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) , the points in the poincar maps are scattered randomly , and the so - called chaotic sea is formed",
    ". that is , the orbits with both sets of parameters are chaotic .",
    "now it is worthwhile to note a weakness in the poincar map . the chaotic sea in figs .  [ fig : pmap ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) can not be distinguished apparently .",
    "indeed , the existence of chaotic sea in the poincar map allows us to judge whether the particle motions in this model are regular or chaotic  @xcite .",
    "the positiveness of the lyapunov exponent , which for this model have been also investigated in  @xcite , does too .",
    "that is , we can tell that the motion is chaotic using these measures .",
    "however , only from these measures , we can not know more than that the motion is merely chaotic , when it is chaotic .",
    "once we find the chaotic behaviors , we should rather characterize the chaos , since being chaotic does not always mean randomness or no rule .",
    "therefore , another method is necessary to characterize the chaos in more detail . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce the power spectrum to classify such chaotic motions .",
    "in this section , we characterize the chaos in the spinning test particle motions which was shown in the previous section . here",
    "we analyze the time series of the particle position . in order to do that ,",
    "first of all , we introduce the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum of the time series of @xmath0 components of the particle s position , @xmath38 , is defined by @xmath39 here we set @xmath40 in our computation .",
    "if we define the autocorrelation function @xmath41 as @xmath42 and take the limit @xmath43 , wiener - khinchin s theorem  @xcite relates the power spectrum @xmath38 and the autocorrelation function @xmath41 as @xmath44    we plot the power spectrum @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ( a ) and [ fig : ps ] ( b ) , we choose parameter sets with the same values as those in figs .  [ fig : pmap ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) , respectively . each line color in figs .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ( a ) and [ fig : ps ] ( b ) also corresponds to that of the dots in figs .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) , respectively . note that the patterns of the power spectra are different between fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ( b ) .",
    "in particular , we find that one is @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps](a ) ) , while the other is white noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps](b ) ) in the low - frequency range about @xmath48 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : wh ] ) , we see that if the power spectrum is of @xmath49 type , the temporal correlation is also of the power - law type , which means a strong temporal correlation with no typical time scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if the power spectrum is of white noise type , temporal correlation is a @xmath50-function , which means no temporal correlation .",
    "therefore we can clearly distinguish the chaotic motions by using the pattern of the power spectrum .",
    "moreover , fig  [ fig : ps ] shows that the pattern of the power spectrum @xmath38 , that is the property of the chaos , depends on the system parameters , the total angular momentum @xmath2 and the spin @xmath3 of the test particle .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig  [ fig : ps ] , the pattern of the power spectrum is independent of the initial conditions , if we fix the parameter set .",
    "furthermore , we test the pattern of the power spectrum @xmath38 for various grid points in the two - dimensional space @xmath4 , and obtain a new phase diagram for the properties of the chaos , summarized in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdia ] .",
    "each value of the energy @xmath24 is chosen as an appropriate one so that the test particle does not escape to infinity and does not fall into the black hole , and the chaotic motions that we pay attention to in this paper are dominant . in the blank region in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] , the test particle goes to infinity or falls into a black hole , since the energy surface is unbounded .",
    "this blank region agrees with the region of the type ( u2 ) in fig.3 in the paper  @xcite . in the region where circle ( @xmath51 ) and cross ( @xmath52 ) symbols are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] , the particle motion is chaotic and bounded . in the region",
    "where circle symbols ( @xmath51 ) are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] , the power spectrum @xmath38 shows @xmath1-type spectrum . on the other hand , in the region where cross symbols ( @xmath52 ) are marked",
    ", the power spectrum @xmath38 shows white noise .",
    "the total region together with dotted and crossed regions is included in the region of the type ( b2 ) in fig.3 in the paper @xcite . in the paper @xcite , the motions in the region of the type ( b2 ) are classified as to be merely chaotic ones .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] means that we succeed in classifying the chaotic motions for various values of parameter set @xmath4 , which have been classified as simply chaotic in former works , into two distinct types , @xmath1 and white noise , using the power spectrum @xmath38 .",
    "now we consider the physical meanings of the tendency of the power spectrum pattern to change from @xmath1 to white noise by increasing the magnitude of spin @xmath3 of the test particle in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] .",
    "let us note that the system is integrable and the motion of the test particle is not chaotic , if the test particle does not have spin ( @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the motion of the test particle with the small magnitude of spin remains almost regular  @xcite .",
    "the motion become remarkably chaotic at last , if the magnitude of the spin is extremely large  @xcite .",
    "then it is reasonable to regard the magnitude of the spin @xmath3 of the test particle as a measure of chaos . considering these facts ,",
    "our results can be interpreted to mean that the pattern of the power spectrum @xmath38 changes from @xmath1 type to white noise as the strength of the chaos increases .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] means that we succeed in classifying the chaotic motions into two categories in accordance with the strength of chaos . in the next section",
    ", we investigate the origin of the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum @xmath38 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the origin of the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum @xmath38 that we found out in the previous section .",
    "the relations between the physical quantities and figures are summarized in table  [ tab : summary - of - figures ] . to begin with , we look more closely at the time evolution of the orbits which were analyzed in the previous section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ps ] ) .    first , in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13 ] , we plot the time series of the @xmath32 components in the poincar map with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we choose parameter sets in figs .",
    "[ fig : poin13 ] ( a ) and [ fig : poin13 ] ( b ) with the same values as those in figs .  [",
    "fig : pmap ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap ] ( b ) , respectively . in fig .  [ fig : poin13 ] ( a ) the values of the @xmath32 components in the poincar map fluctuate with stagnation .",
    "it seems that the duration of the stagnation varies from time to time , and is a mixture of various lengths .",
    "there is no typical one .",
    "this feature is observed commonly when the power spectrum @xmath38 is the @xmath1 type .",
    "then we expect that this behavior is closely related to the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ( a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13 ] ( b ) , on the other hand , the values of the @xmath32 components in the poincar map oscillate almost monotonously .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the power spectrum @xmath38 showing white noise in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps](b ) .",
    "second , in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] , we plot the same orbit we shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : poin13 ] ( a ) in the two - dimensional configuration space @xmath56 .",
    "we find that the whole orbit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] ( a ) ) has two significant components ( figs .",
    "[ fig : orb ] ( b ) and [ fig : orb ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the periods when the orbit stagnates around each component in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] perfectly correspond to that when @xmath32 components in the poincar map stagnate in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13 ] ( a ) .",
    "we never see such stagnant motions when the power spectrum become white noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13](b ) ) .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum @xmath38 are originated by the stagnation and the stickiness around these two distinguishable components , while traveling back and forth between them , in the particle motions .",
    "now , let us show a mechanism by which the motion is stagnant or not , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : poin13 ] and [ fig : orb ] ; that is , the power spectrum @xmath38 shows @xmath1 or white noise as shown in figs  [ fig : ps ] , depending on the combination of @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdia ] .",
    "the essence of the mechanism is that such stagnant motions are originated around the tori ( regular orbits ) , and the structure of the tori changes depending on the combination of @xmath4 . to see the structure of tori more clearly , it is useful to see the motions at lower energy where the chaotic sea shrinks and tori get larger . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] we plot the poincar maps with same values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] but smaller values of @xmath24 . around this value of energy @xmath24 ,",
    "the structure of tori is not very sensitive to the change of @xmath24 , compared to the changes of @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the volume of the chaotic sea in the poincar maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] is smaller than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] .",
    "however , we will see that the topological structure of the phase space is quite similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] .    first , we pay attention to the chaotic orbits which we saw in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmap - low ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13-low ] we plot the time series of the @xmath32 components in the poincar maps fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] .",
    "we adopt each data in figs .",
    "[ fig : poin13-low ] ( a ) and [ fig : poin13-low ] ( b ) as the chaotic orbits that are plotted in figs .  [ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap - low ] ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it is found that the values of the @xmath32 components fluctuate with stagnation in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13-low ] ( a ) , while they do not in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13-low ] ( b ) .",
    "the feature about the stagnation in figs .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap - low ] ( b ) is similar to that in figs .  [",
    "fig : poin13 ] ( a ) and [ fig : poin13 ] ( b ) , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb - low ] , we plot the same orbit we showed in fig .  [",
    "fig : poin13-low ] ( a ) in the two - dimensional configuration space @xmath56 .",
    "similarly to the higher - energy case in figs .",
    "[ fig : poin13 ] and [ fig : orb ] , the periods when the orbit stagnates around each component in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb - low ] perfectly correspond to that when @xmath32 components in the poincar map stagnate in fig .",
    "[ fig : poin13-low](a ) .",
    "now , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - low ] we plot the power spectrum @xmath38 of the same chaotic orbits as figs .",
    "[ fig : poin13-low ] ( a ) and [ fig : poin13-low ] ( b ) .",
    "it is clearly confirmed that the pattern of the power spectrum @xmath38 shows @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - low ] ( a ) , while the pattern shows white noise in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - low ] ( b ) .",
    "therefore , similarly to the higher - energy case , it is suggested that the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum @xmath38 are originated by the motion which stagnates and sticks around the two distinguishable components ( figs .",
    "[ fig : orb - low ] ( b ) and [ fig : orb - low ] ( c ) ) , while traveling back and forth between them .",
    "our results indicate that the pattern of the power spectrum @xmath38 of the chaotic orbits strongly depends on the value of the total angular momentum @xmath2 and spin @xmath3 , while the value of energy @xmath24 does not affect the pattern of the power spectrum so strongly , although it affects the volume of the tori .",
    "second , we pay attention to the tori ( regular orbits ) which we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] we plot the orbits of the tori in the two - dimensional configuration space @xmath56 .",
    "each color of lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : torus - low ] ( b ) corresponds to that of closed curves in figs .  [",
    "fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : pmap - low ] ( b ) .",
    "for example , the orbits a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) correspond to the closed curves a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) .",
    "indeed , the existence of some regular orbits in this model have been shown in the paper  @xcite . in this paper , however , we should emphasize that the structure of the phase space is quite different between panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] or fig .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] . for example ,",
    "any tori which correspond to a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) or fig .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) can never be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] ( b ) or fig .  [ fig : torus - low ] ( b ) .",
    "that is , we should emphasize that the topological structure of the tori changes depending on the parameter sets @xmath4 , and the change is in accordance with the change of types of the power spectra ( see figs .  [ fig : ps - low ] and [ fig : torus - low ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is quite important to note that the orbits of the tori a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) resemble the chaotic orbits in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] ( c ) and fig .  [",
    "fig : orb ] ( b ) , or fig .",
    "[ fig : orb - low ] ( b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : orb - low ] ( c ) , respectively .",
    "this resemblance means that the orbits in figs .",
    "[ fig : orb ] and [ fig : orb - low ] stagnates around the tori a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) , although it is not easy to detect such tori in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmap ] ( a ) since chaotic sea dominates and the tori a and b shrink extremely with the larger value of the energy @xmath24 .",
    "summing up the above results leads us to the following conclusions .",
    "the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum are originated by the orbit which stagnates around the tori while traveling back and forth between them .",
    "whether we can observe @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum in the time series of a component depends on the topological structure of the phase space .",
    "it is the pair of tori a and b in figs  [ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) that gives rise to the @xmath1 fluctuations in the power spectrum @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , our results suggest that the topological structure of the tori changes strongly depending on the total angular momentum @xmath2 and spin @xmath3 rather than the energy @xmath24 . therefore , it is reasonable that the pattern of power spectrum @xmath38 of the chaotic motion depends mainly on the parameter sets @xmath4 , and we can expect that the phase diagram that we obtained in the previous section ( see fig .  [ fig : pdia ] ) is reliable .",
    "in this paper we have characterized the properties of chaos in a spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we have calculated the power spectrum of the time series of @xmath0 components of the test particle s position , @xmath38 , and found out that the pattern of the power spectrum @xmath38 is @xmath1 or white noise in the low - frequency range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ps ] ) .",
    "that is , we have succeeded in classifying the chaotic motions , which had been classified as merely chaotic in the paper  @xcite , into these two distinct types ( see table  [ tab : classification ] ) .",
    "the important point is that the pattern of the power spectrum strongly depends on the spin @xmath3 and the total angular momentum @xmath2 of the test particle and not on the initial conditions .",
    "our analyses also suggest that the value of the energy @xmath24 does not affect so strongly whether the power spectrum @xmath38 becomes @xmath1-type spectrum or not ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : ps ] and [ fig : ps - low ] ) . then , testing the pattern of @xmath38 for various grid points in two - dimensional @xmath4 plane , we have obtained the phase diagram for the character of the chaotic motions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pdia ] ) .",
    "this phase diagram enables us in principle to guess the properties of the system ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) by observing the dynamics of the test particle , even if the motion is chaotic .",
    "furthermore we have pointed out that the pair of tori a and b in figs  [ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) gives rise to the @xmath1-type power spectrum of the time series of @xmath0 components of the particle s position @xmath38 .",
    "the important point is that the chaotic orbits stick near the tori , while traveling back and forth between them .",
    "whenever the power spectrum @xmath38 becomes the @xmath1 spectral pattern , we have found that the orbit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] ( a ) ) stagnates around two significant components ( figs .",
    "[ fig : orb ] ( b ) and [ fig : orb ] ( c ) ) .",
    "moreover , investigating the motions with the value of lower energy where more tori dominate , we have confirmed that such significant components imitate the orbits of the tori characterized as @xmath57 and @xmath58 in figs .",
    "[ fig : pmap - low ] ( a ) and [ fig : torus - low ] ( a ) .",
    "eventually , the conclusion is summarized as follows .",
    "we have two types of chaos as we have seen by the power spectra in the system we have studied in this paper .",
    "one is @xmath1 , and the other is white noise .",
    "the difference of the properties of chaos or the power spectra is caused by the topological structure of the phase space , which in turn is governed by the physical parameter set @xmath4 of the system . from this point of view , the chaos we found in this paper is not always merely random .",
    "the type of motion where the phase point in chaotic orbit stays close to some regular orbits ( tori ) for some long time is known as `` stagnant motion '' or `` sticky motion , '' and is often observed in hamiltonian dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "stagnant motions are usually accompanied by @xmath1 fluctuations and are considered to be due to the fractal structure of the phase space  @xcite . in particular , stagnant motions are often observed for weakly chaotic , nearly integrable systems .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we have observed the @xmath1 fluctuations for smaller values of spin @xmath3 when the chaos is weak , and white noise for larger values of spin @xmath3 when the chaos is strong .",
    "until now such @xmath1 fluctuations have not been discovered in any relativistic systems .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1 fluctuations we observed for the first time in the relativistic system are also generated by such stagnant motion , that the particle motion stagnates around regular orbits , while traveling back and forth between them in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "finally the astrophysical implications of our results should be mentioned .",
    "it is true that the value of the spin @xmath3 where the particle motion is remarkably chaotic is so large that such a star can not exist , which has been remarked in the paper  @xcite .",
    "then the result obtained in this paper is relevant as an illustration and is not directly applicable to a physical system .",
    "however , it is expected that the method and theory in this paper can be useful and applied to other astrophysical systems in practice , since nature is filled with phenomena that exhibit chaotic behavior .",

    "<S> we study the properties of chaos in the motions of a spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the chaos using the power spectrum of the time series of @xmath0 components of the particle s position . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the pattern of the power spectrum shows not only white noise but also @xmath1-type fluctuation , depending on the value of the total angular momentum @xmath2 and the spin @xmath3 of the test particle . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we succeed in classifying the chaotic motions , which have been classified as simply chaotic ones in former works , into the two distinct types . </S>",
    "<S> one is @xmath1 , and the other is white noise . </S>",
    "<S> based on this classification , we plot , in the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath4 , the phase diagram for the properties of the chaos . </S>",
    "<S> this phase diagram enables us in principle to guess the properties of the system @xmath4 by observing the dynamics of the test particle , even if the motion is chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we detect that the origin of the @xmath1 fluctuation is that the particle motion stagnates around regular orbits ( tori ) , while traveling back and forth between them , which is called `` stagnant motion '' or `` sticky motion '' in hamiltonian dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that the difference of the property of the chaos or the power spectra is due to the topological structure of the phase space , which in turn is governed by the physical parameter set @xmath4 of the system . from this point of view , the chaos we found in this system is not always merely random . </S>"
