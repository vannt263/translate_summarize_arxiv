    "in the earliest stages of star formation , the class 0/i phases @xcite , the newborn protostar is embedded within a dense envelope of gas and dust . in the class 0 phase , little or no emission is generally detected shortward of @xmath110@xmath3 m due to high extinction toward the central object ; however , the bipolar outflows from the central protostar and disk carve cavities in the envelopes creating scattered light nebulae visible in the near to mid - infrared ( 1 - 8@xmath3 m ) .",
    "the morphology of the outflow cavities then result from a ram pressure balance between the infalling envelope and outflow @xcite .",
    "early models of infalling envelopes assumed spherical collapse @xcite along with slow rotation @xcite , which were later modified for infall from initially flattened geometries @xcite .",
    "the rotating collapse model provides a natural route for the formation of circumstellar disks within the protostellar envelope .",
    "however , disks in class 0 objects have been difficult to study primarily because of the surrounding envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and insufficient resolution at millimeter wavelengths to isolate the protostellar disk . in addition",
    ", the small - scale structure of outflow cavities in class 0 protostars has also been elusive due to the envelope extincting near - ir scattered light emission , shifting the scattered light emission peak into the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "one of the nearest low - mass protostars in taurus ( d = 140pc ) , l1527 irs ( hereafter l1527 ) , has been a favorite target for studies of outflow and envelope structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been classified as class 0 protostar @xcite but could be a class i system given its edge - on orientation @xcite , which enhances the amount of extinction along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the moderate resolution irac images of l1527 from _ spitzer _ reveal bright bipolar cavities extending @xmath110000 au in radius @xcite .",
    "the outflow cavities are separated by what appears to be a large - scale ( @xmath11000 au ) dark lane ; however , we observed a central point - source between the cavities within the dark lane from 3.6 to 8@xmath3 m . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we were able to explain this by constructing a model assuming that the point - source was a compact inner outflow cavity , unresolved by _ spitzer _ , connecting with the larger outer cavity .",
    "we then proposed high - resolution mid - ir imaging to test this model .    in this paper , we present high resolution l@xmath0-band ( 3.8@xmath3 m ) observations of l1527 from the gemini north telescope .",
    "this is the highest resolution mid - ir image of the inner envelope / outflow cavity around a class 0 protostar .",
    "the observations confirm our prediction of a compact , bipolar scattered light structure ; quite similar to the model constructed in paper i but strongly resembling a disk in scattered light .",
    "we observed l1527 with the 8.1 meter gemini north telescope at mauna kea on 2009 october 24 and 2009 december 11 using the near - infrared imager ( niri ) in l@xmath0-band ( 3.8@xmath3 m ) .",
    "the camera was used in f/14 mode which provides a 0.049@xmath2 pix@xmath4 scale ; we only used the central 512x512 area of the detector for faster read - out which enabled integrations short enough to avoid saturation from sky background .",
    "we observed with a standard 5-point `` dice-5 '' dither pattern with 5@xmath2 steps and a nearby star was used for tip - tilt correction and guiding . at each position",
    "150 coadded images of 0.2 seconds were taken ; a total of 35 images were taken yielding 16 minutes of integration during the first observation and 176 images totaling 88 minutes of integration during the second observation . however , the first 38 images in the second observation were unusable due to variable sky background .",
    "observations of the standard star hd 22686 show that the seeing was @xmath10.3@xmath2 on both nights .",
    "the raw data were reduced using the gemini iraf package .",
    "flat field images were generated from sky flats constructed by median combining the dithered images .",
    "each on - source frame was sky subtracted using a median sky generated from the on - source frame and the two images taken immediately before and after .",
    "this method of sky subtraction compensates for the rapid variations in sky brightness at l@xmath0-band .",
    "the sky subtracted images were then combined using the imcombine task of iraf using the offsets given in the header ; l1527 was quite faint in the individual frames and could not be used for further refinement of the offsets .",
    "the datasets from both epochs of observation were combined yielding a final image with 85 minutes of integration .",
    "we also include data taken with the infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite on the _ spitzer space telescope_. these data were taken in 24 february 2004 as part of the gto taurus survey and were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the images of l1527 at l@xmath0-band and 3.6@xmath3 m are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the irac image clearly shows the point - like structure appearing in the center of the envelope between the large scattered light cavities .",
    "the gemini l@xmath0 image resolves the point - like structure into a compact , bipolar scattered light nebula at the center of l1527 .",
    "the two lobes are separated by a narrow dark lane @xmath10.45@xmath2 ( 60 au ) wide , consistent with a circumstellar disk shadow .",
    "the l@xmath0 image reveals structure similar to that of the _ hubble _ nicmos images of class i protostars in taurus from @xcite .",
    "however , this is the first time such an image has been captured of a class 0 protostar .",
    "the total extent of the bipolar structure in the direction of the outflow ( east - west ) is @xmath12.5@xmath2 ( 350 au ) and @xmath11.8@xmath2 ( 250 au ) in width .",
    "the extent of the scattered light along the outflow and dark lane is much thicker than a prototypical disk ( i.e. hh30 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicating that the disk in l1527 is more vertically extended or that the scattering is coming from the inner envelope .",
    "the eastern lobe is about twice as bright as the western lobe ; consistent with eastern side being slightly inclined toward us ( @xmath185@xmath5 ) ( paper i ) .",
    "the orientation of the disk dark lane indicates that the rotation axis of the system has a position angle @xmath185@xmath5 east of north .",
    "we also see extended , low surface brightness outflow cavity emission extending away from the inner envelope in the gemini image .",
    "the cavity is quite narrow until @xmath16@xmath2 ( 840 au ) from the center ; this narrowness was not well resolved in the _ spitzer _ image .",
    "past 6@xmath2 , the cavity expands rapidly to very wide angles . the total flux within a 7@xmath614 ( 1000 au ) aperture radius is 6.5 @xmath7 0.6 mjy , consistent with the irac flux from paper i.      we use the monte carlo radiative transfer code of @xcite to interpret the observations .",
    "the model components are described in paper i , but we discuss some important aspects here for completeness . the envelope density structure is the standard rotating collapse solution @xcite in which envelope density scales with the infall rate @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xmath10 r@xmath11 outside the centrifugal radius ( r@xmath12 ) and @xmath9 @xmath10 r@xmath13 inside r@xmath12 .",
    "conical outflow cavities are carved out of the envelope , their shape is defined by a polynomial , the degree of the polynomial is the shape parameter .",
    "we use the dust model from paper i for the envelope which has grains up to 1@xmath3 m in radius .",
    "the disk is defined by its initial scale height h@xmath14 at the stellar radius r@xmath15 and flaring power law h @xmath10 r@xmath16 , radial density profile @xmath9 @xmath10 r@xmath17 , mass , and outer radius .",
    "the vertical structure of the disk is assumed to be gaussian with an initial scale height defined to be in hydrostatic equilibrium at the dust destruction radius ( t@xmath18=1600k ) .",
    "values of @xmath19 = 9/8 , 5/4 are commonly used , corresponding to isothermal scale heights with @xmath20 @xmath10 r@xmath21 and r@xmath13 .",
    "the gas and dust of the disk are assumed to be well mixed .",
    "the dust opacities for the disk are taken from @xcite which were used to model the sed of hh30 .",
    "the dust is distributed in a quasi - settled manner with grains up to 1 mm in the disk midplane while smaller grains remain extended .",
    "the transition between these dust populations is defined to be n@xmath22=10@xmath23@xmath24 or the first scale height .    in paper",
    "i , we inferred that the apparent point source seen at 3.6@xmath3 m was in fact a bipolar structure seen in reflected light , with the true central source actually hidden by extinction .",
    "to create this structure , we constructed a dual - cavity model having a narrow inner cavity with an outer cavity offset by 100 au ( see figure 10 of paper i for an illustration ) . comparing the top and middle rows of figure 2",
    "shows that our prediction was qualitatively correct .",
    "we next take advantage of the high spatial resolution of the gemini data to improve our understanding of the inner structure .",
    "we required that models reproduce both the l@xmath25 and irac images and the broadband sed and irs spectrum ( * ? ? ? * and paper i ) , as it is important to use as many constraints as possible ( paper i , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we first adjusted the parameters of the dual - cavity model to better reproduce the gemini observations by varying the inner and outer cavity shapes and opening angles .",
    "as shown in figures 2 and 3 , our best - fit dual - cavity model reproduces the observations reasonably well ( note that the images for the refined dual - cavity model are not shown as they nearly identical to the disk model as discussed below ) . the envelope infall rate for this model was 10@xmath26m@xmath27 yr@xmath4 ; the outer cavity was offset from the inner cavity by 85 au .",
    "the disk parameters are h(10au)= 1.87 au with @xmath19 = 1.25 , h@xmath14 = 0.0332 r@xmath15 , @xmath28= 0.05m@xmath27 and @xmath29= 25 au ; a model with @xmath19 = 1.125 was also able to be fit , but with double the initial scale height ; the full parameter set is listed in table 1 .",
    "we did not consider a disk model in paper i because the large - scale dark lane seemed to be too thick to be reproduced with a disk .",
    "however , using the detailed gemini image , we can describe disk parameters which yield scattering surfaces comparable to that of the dual - cavity model .",
    "the highly - flared disk in this model had h(10au)= 1.95 au ( h(190au ) = 82 au ) , with @xmath19 = 1.27 , @xmath30 = 3.0 , h@xmath14 = 0.03 r@xmath15 , @xmath28= 0.005m@xmath27 and @xmath29= 190 au .",
    "the envelope infall rate was lowered to 0.8 @xmath31 10@xmath26m@xmath27 yr@xmath4 in order to allow more scattered light from the disk to escape through the envelope .",
    "we also used the envelope dust model for the disk upper layers rather than the default dust model ; this increased the l@xmath0 intensity and reduced emission from 10 to 60 @xmath3 m ( see table 1 for other parameters ) bringing the model into closer agreement with the observations .",
    "as shown in figures 2 and 3 , this model also provides reasonable agreement with the observations .",
    "the dual - cavity model in paper i was justified based on simulations with a wide - angle outflow and a highly flattened envelope density distribution @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear if such a flattened envelope is present in l1527 , as there is no evidence for this in submillimeter observations @xcite . in addition , the outflow cavity on scales larger that 840 au from the central object does not easily fit within this framework due to the rapid widening of the scattered light nebula beyond 840 au (  3 ; figure 1 ) this is difficult to explain with a simple conical cavity because there is no direct line - of - sight from the protostar / disk to these parts of the outflow cavity .",
    "therefore we suggest that the morphology of the scattered light nebulosity on large scales is not due directly to the outflow but to the morphology of the envelope and/or ambient medium @xcite . in any case",
    "it appears difficult to explain the complex shape of the scattered light structures with an simple outflow - envelope interaction",
    ".    given these difficulties , the disk scenario seems attractive .",
    "images of disks in silhouette have previously been observed around t - tauri stars ( class ii sources ) and class i protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the small - scale scattered light morphology of l1527 bears a resemblance to that of iras 04302 + 2247 and hh30 .",
    "the problem for this model is that the disk must be highly flared , with the aspect ratio of the disk extinction lane relative to the extent of the scattered light surfaces being about a factor of two larger than other objects . to reproduce the compact scattered light and large - scale dark lane with a disk , it was necessary to adopt a high degree of flaring in the disk ( @xmath19=1.27 ) , a steep density profile ( @xmath30=3.0 ) , a large disk radius ( r@xmath18=190au ) , and a small disk mass ( m@xmath18=0.005m@xmath27 ) .",
    "( note that the mass is simply a formal parameter of the model for scaling the density . extrapolating disk masses from fitting scattered light in the disk upper layers",
    "is problematic since they contain a small fraction of the total mass . )",
    "these observations and modeling emphasize not only that disks form early during protostellar collapse @xcite but also that disks with large radii are able to form during the class 0 phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with radii comparable to class ii disks in taurus @xcite .",
    "in general , dust growth and/or depletion in upper disk layers relative to ism conditions is needed to reproduce the scattered light images of edge - on disk systems and the seds of t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be that the postulated l1527 disk has had much less dust evolution and thus has more small dust in upper layers , making it easier to explain the wide extinction lane observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite directly imaged the disk of l1527 and a binary companion separated from the primary by 0.17@xmath2 ( 24 au ) with vla @xmath32=7 mm observations .",
    "these observations are overplotted on the l@xmath0 image in figure 4 .",
    "the observed disk is quite compact - only @xmath10.3@xmath2 ( 40 au ) in diameter .",
    "though this system is a close binary , we do not expect the companion to affect the modeled parameters significantly , because our results mostly constrain the outer disk .",
    "the compactness of the disk measured @xcite is not inconsistent with our disk model since the @xmath32=7 mm observations will only be sensitive to the densest part of the disk and where the grains are largest .",
    "their measured disk mass of 0.1@xmath33 is substantially larger than our disk model ( which is uncertain as discussed previously ) .",
    "note that the disk mass is strongly dependent on the assumed dust mass opacities ; @xcite used a dust opacity model based on @xcite which had @xmath34=4.9@xmath3110@xmath35@xmath36g@xmath4 ( p. dalessio private communication ) ) .",
    "@xcite used @xmath37=0.035 @xmath36g@xmath4 with @xmath38 @xmath10 @xmath39 which yields @xmath34=0.00425 @xmath36g@xmath4 when extrapolated .",
    "the difference between the @xmath34 values can be attributed to the @xcite dust model only considering grains up to 1@xmath3 m in size while the dust model used by @xcite considered grains up to 1 mm in size . scaling the @xcite @xmath32=7 mm mass to @xmath34 from @xcite gives @xmath28=0.0095@xmath33 , in agreement with the mean disk mass of taurus .    from the observations and modeling it is now clear that the small - scale scattered light in l1527 is most likely due to a disk .",
    "however , the assumed parameters needed to fit the disk model ( e.g. steep density profile ) may only have been necessary to enable our simplistic treatment of disk structure to work for l1527 .",
    "models which solve for the vertical structure of the disk self - consistently ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , given the irradiation from the central object have a density structure that is not gaussian ( as assumed in our modeling ) but falls off less rapidly with @xmath40 because the temperature increases with vertical height @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , even in the context of an isothermal structure , the gaussian density distribution becomes a poor approximation as the ratio of the vertical height to radial distance becomes @xmath41 .",
    "these issues deserve further investigation with physically self - consistent radiative transfer modeling of l1527 .",
    "we have presented high - resolution l@xmath0 imaging of the inner envelope of l1527 demonstrating that much can be learned of inner envelope structure and newly forming disks with high resolution scattered light observations of class 0 protostars .",
    "the observations strongly resemble the dual - cavity model constructed in @xcite ; however , the observations can be equally well reproduced by a large , highly flared disk or a refined dual - cavity structure .",
    "however , the global scattered light structure is difficult to interpret as purely an outflow cavity .",
    "we therefore suggest that the bright scattered light structure is most likely be a vertically extended disk - in - formation with material falling onto it .",
