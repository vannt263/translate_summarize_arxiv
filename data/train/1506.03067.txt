    "since the discovery of the integer quantum hall effect @xcite , the physics of topological states has established itself as a privileged crossroads for diverse communities .",
    "a quarter of a century later , the discovery of topological insulators @xcite has propelled the interest in this area @xcite .",
    "this time , rather than high magnetic fields , the key ingredient was the spin - orbit coupling which is naturally strong in compounds made of heavy elements .",
    "recent studies hint that there might be a third alternative enabling non - trivial topology : shining a laser on a sample @xcite to generate _ floquet topological states _ @xcite",
    ". the sample could be either graphene @xcite , a trivial insulator @xcite , 3d dirac semimetal @xcite , or a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "the opening of laser - induced bandgaps has already been observed @xcite and new experiments @xcite and theories are being developed to unveil the states fingerprint of their topology @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ the bulk boundary correspondence @xcite , their dynamics @xcite , occupation @xcite , transport properties @xcite and the connection between the hall response and the edge states @xcite .    at the time of the birth of the integer quantum hall effect @xcite another important",
    "finding was the discovery of conducting polymers @xcite .",
    "later on , it became clear that the simple tight - binding model proposed by su , schrieffer and heeger @xcite in 1979 to describe the dimerization in polyacetylene ( today named the ssh model ) is , indeed , a minimal example of a one - dimensional topological insulator ( see for example refs . ) .",
    "the topologically trivial or non - trivial character of the dimerized chain is controlled by the relative strength of the intracell - to - intercell couplings : a tight - binding chain with hoppings bearing alternating values @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath0 being the intracell hopping as represented in fig . [ fig1](a ) ) sustains one topological state localized at each termination if @xmath2 , and zero otherwise ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the existence of such states , in turn , is related to a topological invariant called zak phase .",
    "unit cells and where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the intra- and intercell hoppings , respectively . while the bulk spectrum is independent of the ratio @xmath3 ( shown in ( b ) and ( c ) in gray for @xmath4 and black line for @xmath5 ) , the spectrum of a finite chain ( shown in blue dots in panels ( b ) and ( c ) ) differs in the absence ( b , @xmath6 ) or presence ( c , @xmath2 ) of mid - gap states .",
    "( d ) scheme of the driven ssh model considered in the text . ]    here we inquire about the effect of a time - dependent perturbation on the ssh model , thereby providing a minimal case of a driven topological insulator .",
    "the driving considered here consists of a modulation of the hoppings with spacial period @xmath7 ( the same as for the ssh model , see scheme in fig . [ fig1](d ) ) .",
    "in particular , a relevant question is how driving affects the native topology .",
    "for example , if starting from the undimerized chain one adds a time - dependent modulation of the hoppings , then , as the instantaneous ratio @xmath3 changes , snapshots taken at different times would correspond to configurations consistent with a switching from a topologically trivial insulator to a non - trivial one , back and forth .",
    "although previous works have addressed driven one - dimensional systems in a variety of contexts @xcite , the above question still remain .    by using floquet theory",
    "we show that driving can induce new gaps depending critically on the driving frequency / strength and change dramatically the gaps of the undriven model .",
    "interestingly , the newly formed gaps may host floquet edge states while those at the pre - existent gaps can be annihilated by the driving .",
    "the topological transitions leading to such changes are studied in detail complementing our numerical study with a calculation of the relevant topological invariant , i.e. the zak phase @xcite .",
    "our results reveal a subtle competition between the different available photon - assisted processes and the native topology of the model to set the final character of each gap .",
    "we show that as the frequency is lowered , each time new inelastic processes come to play one has that either that the pre - existent edge states are destroyed , if they already exist , or new ones are created , if they were not present before .",
    "these floquet topological transitions could be tested in cold matter where there is much interest in driven topological phases from the theoretical point of view @xcite and where recent experimental progress has allowed the realization of the ssh model @xcite , the haldane model @xcite , the hofstadter model@xcite , and even the measurement of the relevant topological invariants @xcite .",
    "the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite describes the dimerization that occurs in a one - dimensional periodic system subject to a cell doubling perturbation in the spirit of the peierls transition@xcite .",
    "here we consider a variant of the ssh model where the hoppings are modulated in time so that nearby bonds have opposite phases :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation ( anihilation ) operators at site @xmath11 ( which can be either @xmath12 or @xmath13-type ) of the @xmath14-th unit cell , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the dimerization strength and @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the driving amplitude .",
    "the onsite energies @xmath20 may all be taken equal to a reference energy ( zero energy ) , @xmath21 is taken as the unit of energy and the lattice constant for the dimerized phase is @xmath7 ( as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .    the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) corresponds to the usual ssh model and the second term accounts for the driving . in the bulk limit",
    ", the static part of the hamiltonian can also be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a @xmath24 matrix written in the basis of a and b sites , @xmath25 is the vector of pauli matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a vector with vanishing z - component since a and b have the same local energy .",
    "the latter assures that chiral symmetry is preserved @xcite : if @xmath28 is an eigenvalue then its opposite @xmath29 is one too ( the spectrum is therefore symmetric ) . imposing this symmetry",
    "ensures the existence of two distinct topological phases ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) for the static system .",
    "one can verify that the driving term satisfies a generalized chiral symmetry and the floquet spectrum is symmetric with respect to @xmath32 ( @xmath33 integer ) .",
    "the properties of interest in our work can be obtained by using floquet theory which is particularly tailored for time - periodic hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "given a time - periodic hamiltonian with period @xmath34 , there is a complete set of floquet solutions of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the so - called quasienergies and @xmath37 are the associated floquet states . by inserting these solutions into the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    ", one gets that the floquet states satisfy an equation analogous to the time - independent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian being replaced by the floquet hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "thus , one has an eigenvalue problem in the direct product floquet space @xcite : @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the usual hilbert space and @xmath41 the space of periodic functions with period @xmath42 which is spanned by the functions @xmath43 .",
    "the index @xmath44 can be assimilated to the number of ` photon ' excitations @xcite , and defines a subspace also called _",
    "@xmath45 floquet replica_. note that in this energy domain solution we do not need to resort to the consideration of the time - evolution operator .    in our calculations we used different codes including : a code built on kwant @xcite and a home - made implementation using recursive green s functions allowing to deal with a semi - infinite system . the numerical calculation of the zak phase was carried out using the python tight - binding package ( pythtb ) .",
    "let us focus first on the quasienergy spectrum of the bulk system .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the spectrum of the undriven system without ( @xmath4 ) and with ( @xmath46 ) the cell - doubling perturbation , respectively .",
    "while the former does not have a gap , the latter does have one at zero energy of magnitude @xmath47 .",
    "the color scale represents the weight on different replicas , from blue for unit weight on the @xmath48 replica to grey .",
    "this weight can be interpreted as the contribution of each state of energy @xmath49 to the time - averaged density of states at the same energy @xcite .",
    "the most relevant effects of driving take place at the points where the spectrum becomes degenerate . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus only on the energy range spanned by the @xmath48 replica . in that case , the degenerate points at the frequency plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a - d ) are located at either @xmath50 or @xmath51 .     and the driving amplitude @xmath19 . in the available range",
    "we can distinguish the floquet replicas with @xmath52 , and the color bar indicates the contribution to the time - averaged density of states .",
    "starting from the undriven model ( a ) and ( b ) , and considering the process related to the @xmath48 replica , we can see how the model develops gaps at @xmath53 in ( c ) and ( d ) , and also at @xmath54 in ( f ) .",
    "in these plots @xmath55 for ( c ) and ( d ) and @xmath56 for ( e ) and ( f ) ; @xmath57 in ( b),(d ) and ( f ) ; and @xmath58 ( c ) to ( f ) . ]    once the time - dependent perturbation is switched on ( as in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) , the degeneracies at @xmath59 ( involving states with @xmath48 and @xmath60 ) are lifted leading to the _ driving - induced bandgaps_. similar gaps were previously found in the context of carbon nanotubes affected by the interaction with a single optical phonon mode @xcite , which gives a quantized version of our model .",
    "what is the origin of such gaps in this one - dimensional system ?",
    "in contrast to the driving - induced gaps in graphene illuminated with a circularly polarized laser @xcite , where opening a gap among the @xmath48 and @xmath60 replicas requires breaking time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , _ the gap opening mechanism in the driven ssh model relies on the spacial periodicity of the time - dependent perturbation _ ( no trs breaking is necessary ) . indeed , the time - dependent perturbation must have a component with a spacial period @xmath7 to mix different floquet replicas , so that the degeneracies between states at @xmath53 are lifted as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the gap has a magnitude of @xmath61 .",
    "since this process involves the floquet replicas with @xmath48 and @xmath62 , energy exchange ( photon emission / absorption ) is crucial for these gaps to occur , thereby highlighting their _ non - adiabatic _ nature .",
    "when the frequency is low enough so that more replicas overlap with each other , one can notice how higher order effects develop ( new degeneracies appear within the spectral support of the @xmath48 replica ) .",
    "this is the case in figs . [",
    "fig2](e ) and ( f ) where @xmath63 .",
    "the gaps at @xmath59 are almost unnoticeable in this case and there are new driving induced gaps at @xmath64 which appear only when @xmath65 ( see panels ( e ) and ( f ) ) and correspond to the mixing of the @xmath48 and @xmath66 replicas .",
    "the processes leading to those gaps are more subtle and involve virtual transitions through intermediate states .",
    "the magnitude of the gap , that we denote with @xmath67 , can be worked out analytically .",
    "one gets : @xmath68 , hence , the gap is proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "the gap at zero energy ( which is reduced as compared to panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) is also determined now by @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis of the previous section gives a first hint on the spectrum of the driven ssh model but does not reveal its most interesting face : are the floquet gaps topological ?",
    "do we have floquet topological edge states ?",
    "how does this depend on the topology of the undriven model ? to answer these questions we analyze the floquet spectrum of a semi - infinite system in a wide range of frequencies chosen to match the experimentally relevant regime in cold matter experiments .",
    "due to the existence of an edge one can infer on the topology from the eventual presence of edge states ( a result which we will later on confirm based on the zak phase ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) for @xmath6 and",
    "[ fig3](b ) for @xmath2 . at each frequency",
    ", the floquet spectrum is plotted on the vertical scale . for easier interpretation a ( blue ) color scale corresponding to the weight of the states on the @xmath48 floquet subspace is used ( thus , it gives the time - averaged density of states for that electronic energy ) . on the other hand ,",
    "edge states are plotted in red , irrespective of their weight on a particular replica , this way one can spot them in the full range without zooming - in the plot . by following the midgap states with the driving frequency ,",
    "figure [ fig3 ] resembles the _ fan diagrams _",
    "widely used for landau levels as a function of the magnetic field .    in the following",
    "we discuss first the set of relevant frequencies where the topology may change ( the _ transition points _ ) .",
    "we then analyze these transitions by looking at the presence of edge states and zak phase . as we will see below , whenever a new pair of replicas starts to contribute at a given midgap energy ,",
    "the zak phase acquires a @xmath70 shift , therefore destroying the pre - existent edge states or creating new ones .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows how the gaps at @xmath71 evolve with frequency .",
    "it also reveals two very distinct regimes : high and low frequency . for simplicity",
    "let us imagine that the driving is turned off while keeping the floquet picture .",
    "then one has the original energy bands and the replicas , which are displaced by @xmath72 , as in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "the high frequency regime occurs when different floquet replicas do not overlap at the energy of interest .",
    "this is satisfied if the frequency is so large that the replicas are well separated . if we are interested in what happens , say , close to @xmath50 , as long as @xmath73 one is in the high frequency regime . on the other hand , close to @xmath74 ,",
    "the high frequency regime takes place for @xmath75 and the gaps at @xmath59 do not form . as the frequency",
    "is lowered , the replicas overlap enough with each other so that two or more of them have states close to the energy we are interested in and we get into the low - frequency regime . whenever a new set of replicas enter into the game ( or leave it )",
    "defines a potential _ transition point _",
    ", where the topology of the bandstructure may change .    when lowering the frequency , whenever new bands acquire spectral weight at @xmath50 they do it in pairs ( because of the electron - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "the first of such events occurs at @xmath76 and subsequent ones follow the rule @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "analogously , the pairs of replicas cease to have spectral weight at frequencies given by @xmath79 , @xmath78 .",
    "a similar behavior is found when looking at @xmath74 , in this case when lowering the frequency new bands enter into the game whenever @xmath80 and gets out at @xmath81 .",
    "for example , in the range shown in fig .",
    "3 , this occurs with the @xmath48 and @xmath82 replicas at frequencies @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "these four equations define the transition points .    in the next paragraphs",
    "we will aim to describe the topological transitions at those transition points .",
    "but before that , let us examine when does the spectrum remains gapped and when it does not .",
    "this is , of course , unless all the floquet replicas present at the energy of interest are simultaneously gapped .",
    "this may occur only at precise energies where the global floquet spectrum is symmetric , in our case @xmath32 with @xmath33 an integer . in particular , at @xmath50 in the range @xmath85 ( this is , in between the first and the second transition points ) , the zero energy gap of the @xmath48 replica matches the weaker gap at @xmath86 above ( below ) the center of the @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) replica ( with magnitude @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus , the gap is preserved but its width is now set by the smaller one , @xmath67 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( f ) ) . as the frequency",
    "is lowered further and new transition points are traversed , the gap acquires a progressively higher order in @xmath19 and therefore decreases to the level where it can be hardly noticed .",
    "a similar analysis holds for the gaps at @xmath53 .",
    "the topology of the undriven system is controlled by the ratio @xmath3 , being trivial when @xmath6 and non - trivial when @xmath2 .",
    "figures [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) show the driven systems in both situations .",
    "we have checked that all the midgap states correspond to edge states , which are indeed absent in a bulk calculation .",
    "two of such states are presented in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , showing an exponential decay with an exponent determined by half the corresponding gap width .",
    "as expected , in the high frequency regime , the topology of the driven system corresponds to that of the undriven one .",
    "this can be inferred from the gaps and the absence / presence of midgap states : fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) does not have midgap states at zero energy while ( b ) does . in the low - frequency regime , there may also be midgap states appearing at @xmath89 . for odd @xmath33 , they turn out to be insensitive to the native topology of the undriven model . in contrast , for even @xmath33 those gaps appear only when @xmath65 and their topology depends on that of the undriven model .",
    "let us analyze in more detail the midgap states .",
    "as mentioned before , at @xmath50 and high frequency ( @xmath73 ) , they follow the same prescription as in the undriven ssh model . at @xmath76 , the replicas with @xmath60 acquire a finite spectral weight at that energy so that the gap closes and a smaller gap reopens for @xmath90 ( the width being this time @xmath67 ) . by examining the midgap",
    "states we see a topological change when traversing the transition point at @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , the topological trivial phase of the ssh model ( @xmath6 ) becomes non trivial and viceversa .",
    "therefore , in the latter case _ driving annihilates the topological edge states present in the undriven system _ while in the former it creates new edge states localized on the replicas with @xmath60 .    at @xmath91 , floquet replicas with @xmath66",
    "enter into the game reducing the gap width and changing the topology once again .",
    "this is , the floquet edge states are now absent if @xmath6 or they re - emerge if @xmath2 ( one observes one edge state on each edge , two edge states in total ) . in the latter case , the nature of the new states is different from the native ones as they have a weight which is predominantly on the @xmath66 replicas .",
    "if we now look at the midgap states at @xmath92 , one observes that they share the same topology , irrespective of the one of the undriven system ( i.e. both figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) are equivalent in these gaps ) .",
    "starting from high frequencies , when @xmath86 becomes smaller than @xmath83 , the gaps at @xmath53 open up hosting midgap edge states .",
    "this is preserved until the next transition point located at @xmath93 when topology changes due to the mixing of floquet replicas with @xmath94 and @xmath87 .",
    "the process is reversed at the following transition point located at @xmath95 in figs . [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) ( where the replicas with @xmath82 and @xmath48 cease to have spectral weight at @xmath92 ) .",
    "in contrast to the topological transitions predicted in the literature for illuminated graphene @xcite ( the reader may find detailed maps in ref . ) , here we have a case where the system bears native topological states ( which we show that can be destroyed or even be replaced by new ones ) and where the number of possible edge states are restricted to a binary value .",
    "how different are the new edge states as compared with those in the undriven model ?",
    "for the undriven model a simple and elegant argument can describe all the topological phases providing a flavor on the nature of the edge states .",
    "indeed , by considering the fully dimerized limit ( when one of the hoppings is zero ) one immediately gets all the possible distinct phases : if @xmath96 then there are no edge states , whereas if @xmath97 one has one edge state at each end of the chain , fully localized on opposite sublattices . in the driven case",
    "this simple argument describes the high frequency regime but fails to accomodate for midgap states at zero energy when @xmath98 or those at @xmath53 .",
    "the finite bandwidth is crucial for the new driven phases to occur since they arise because of its interplay with the photon energy ( allowing or restricting inelastic processes ) . as shown in the insets of fig.[fig3 ] , the new edge states have a non - vanishing weight on more than one floquet replica .",
    "to further confirm the topological nature of these states , we resort to the calculation of topological invariants .",
    "the relevant invariant in our case is the zak phase @xcite @xmath99 defined as : @xmath100 where @xmath101 are the cell - periodic bloch states .",
    "the zak phase is essentially the geometric phase acquired after an adiabatic loop in the brillouin zone .",
    "this phase has been connected to the existence of edge states in graphene @xcite and , interestingly , it has been measured in cold matter systems simulating the ( undriven ) ssh model @xcite and also in acoustic systems @xcite .",
    "differences between zak phases for topologically non - trivial systems in one - dimension are quantized in units of @xmath70 even though the value by itself depends on the choice of the unit cell @xcite .",
    "the sum of the zak phases for all the bands with energy below a given gap indicates the existence ( with the relevant cumulative phase being @xmath70 ) or absence ( vanishing cumulative phase ) of topological mid - gap states .    to compute the zak phase for the floquet quasienergy spectrum one needs to truncate the floquet space .",
    "the number of replicas needs to be chosen so that all relevant transitions at the desired energy are kept .",
    "for example , for @xmath55 , the analytic calculation of the phases @xmath102 for each of the bands marked with letters a - f in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ( considering just those 3 replicas ) gives :    @xmath103    one verifies that the sum of the zak phases do correspond with the edge states found in the simulation of fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we have also verified this by numerical calculation in the frequency range shown in fig .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](c - f ) , where panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the results for the cumulative phase up to @xmath50 , while ( e ) and ( f ) are for @xmath104 , for the trivial and non - trivial undriven system respectively .",
    "considering both the results of the floquet spectrum and of the zak phase , and assuming that the bulk boundary correspondence holds at all frequencies , the behavior of the driven system both at zero energy and at @xmath53 can be put in a nutshell with a simple argument : _ when lowering the driving frequency , every pair of new replicas entering into the game at a given energy adds a @xmath70 to the cumulative zak phase , thereby switching the topology from trivial to non - trivial and viceversa . _",
    "in summary , we analyze the influence of driving on a one - dimensional topological insulator given by the ssh model . our analysis reveals the creation of driving - induced bandgaps at @xmath105 ( @xmath33 integer ) and their evolution .",
    "more interestingly , we show that the topology of these bands turns out to exhibit transitions as the driving frequency changes . both the native gap and the gaps at @xmath106 switch topology from non - trivial to trivial and viceversa .",
    "we attribute these topological transitions to the competition between the native topology and the one due to the driving and also among different photon - assisted processes themselves .",
    "our numerical results are supported by an analysis based on the zak phase for the floquet bands .",
    "the simple model studied here may find a realization in ultracold matter , where the current state of the art allows for manipulations beyond the reach of condensed matter .",
    "previously , the realization of the undriven ssh model in a cold - atom setup permitting the direct measurement of the zak phase has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "there , the additional driving term could be introduced by modulating the lasers used to produce the dimmerized potential , and the topology of the bands could be characterized by measuring the zak phase .",
    "furthermore , with the help of the newly developed high - resolution detection and manipulation techniques @xcite , one could detect the presence of edge states in finite - size systems .",
    "among all the transitions shown in this manuscript , the detection of those occurring at higher frequencies , such as @xmath107 ( opening of the gap at @xmath53 containing topological midgap floquet edge states ) and eventually also of the transition at @xmath108 ( annihilation of the native topological states at zero energy ) , look particularly promising .",

    "<S> the su - schrieffer - heeger model of polyacetylene is a paradigmatic hamiltonian exhibiting non - trivial edge states . by using floquet theory </S>",
    "<S> we study how the spectrum of this one - dimensional topological insulator is affected by a time - dependent potential . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we evidence the competition among different photon - assisted processes and the native topology of the unperturbed hamiltonian to settle the resulting topology at different driving frequencies . while some regions of the quasienergy spectrum develop new gaps hosting floquet edge states , the native gap can be dramatically reduced and the original edge states may be destroyed or replaced by new floquet edge states . </S>",
    "<S> our study is complemented by an analysis of zak phase applied to the floquet bands . besides serving as a simple example for understanding the physics of driven topological phases , our results could find a promising test - ground in cold matter experiments . </S>"
