    "the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron is a simple polytope with @xmath4 ( the catalan number ) vertices , corresponding to the triangulations of a convex @xmath5-gon , and @xmath6 facets , in bijection with the diagonals of the @xmath5-gon .",
    "it appears in dov tamari s unpublished 1951 thesis @xcite , and was described as a combinatorial object and realized as a cellular ball by jim stasheff in 1963 in his work on the associativity of @xmath7-spaces @xcite .",
    "a realization as a polytope by john milnor from the 1960s is lost ; huguet & tamari claimed in 1978 that the associahedron can be realized as a convex polytope @xcite .",
    "the first such construction , via an explicit inequality system , was provided in a manuscript by mark haiman from 1984 that remained unpublished , but is available as @xcite .",
    "the first constructions in print are due to carl lee , from 1989 @xcite .",
    "subsequently three systematic approaches were developed that produce realizations of the associahedra in more general frameworks :    the associahedron as the _ secondary polytope _ of a convex polygon , due to gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * chap .  7 ) ) , depicted in figure  [ fig : hex - secondary ] .",
    "the associahedron as one of the _ generalized permutahedra _ introduced by postnikov in @xcite .",
    "the history of this construction begins with shnider and sternberg @xcite ( compare stasheff and shnider ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) ) , who show that the associahedron can be obtained by cutting certain faces in a simplex ( this is polar to the construction by carl lee in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , which produces the normal fan of the associahedron as a stellar subdivision of the central fan of the simplex ) .",
    "loday  @xcite , shows how to obtain explicit and nice vertex coordinates for this associahedron using combinatorics of binary trees .",
    "postnikov  @xcite then puts loday s construction in context , regarding this associahedron as a special case of a _",
    "generalized permutahedron _ ; a polytope lying in ( the closure of ) the deformation cone of the standard permutahedron .",
    "rote , santos and streinu  @xcite and , more recently , buchstaber  @xcite found constructions of essentially the same asociahedron but described quite differently .",
    "following @xcite we reference this associahedron as the `` loday realization '' .",
    "the associahedron as the polar of the _ cluster complex _ of type @xmath8 , conjectured by fomin and zelevinsky  @xcite and constructed by chapoton , fomin and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "we review these three constructions in section  [ review ] , after some preliminaries in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "the last two of them have the following properties in common :    they both have exactly @xmath0 pairs of parallel facets .    in the basis given by the normals to those @xmath0 pairs ,",
    "all facet normals have coordinates in @xmath9 .",
    "this was generalized by hohlweg and lange  @xcite and by santos  @xcite , who showed that the loday and chapoton  fomin  zelevinsky constructions are particular cases of _ exponentially many different _ constructions of the associahedron , all of them with properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "that is , all these associahedra are ( normally isomorphic to ) polytopes obtained from the regular @xmath0-cube by cutting certain @xmath10 faces , as seen in figure  [ fig : manyassociahedra ] .",

    " zelevinsky associahedron ( a special case of both hohlweg  lange and santos ) and the other two santos associahedra .",
    "since they all have three pairs of parallel facets , we used a linear transformation to draw them fitting in the same cube.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    we discuss these two generalizations in sections  [ sec : exponentially - many ] and  [ sec : triang - many ] .",
    "the construction by santos appears in print for the first time in this paper , so we prove things in detail .",
    "for the hohlweg ",
    "lange realizations we rely on the original papers for most of the details .",
    "let us explain what we exactly mean by _ different _ ( see more details in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",
    "since the associahedron is simple , its realizations form an open subset in the space of @xmath11-tuples of half - spaces in @xmath12 . hence , classifying them by affine or projective equivalence does not seem the right thing to do .",
    "but for the hohlweg  lange and santos constructions , with normals in @xmath13 , the set of possible normal fans obtained is finite .",
    "this suggests that one natural classification is by _ linear isomorphism of normal fans _ or , as we call it , _",
    "normal isomorphism_. in this language :    the ( normal isomorphism classes of ) hohlweg  lange associahedra are in bijection with the sequences in @xmath14 , modulo reflection and reversal ( theorem  [ thm : classification_hl ] , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cor .  2.6 ) ) .",
    "the ( normal isomorphism classes of ) santos associahedra are in bijection with the triangulations of the @xmath5-gon , modulo dihedral symmetries of the polygon ( corollary  [ corollary : triangmany_distinct ] ) .",
    "the numbers of distinct associahedra obtained by the two constructions are , thus , roughly @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; exact counts are in sections [ sec : exponentially - many ] and [ sec : triang - many ] , see also table  [ table : two - types ] . although a classification of the hohlweg ",
    "lange associahedra appears already in  @xcite , we think our new derivation it has some novelty . on the one hand ,",
    "the classification in  @xcite is only up to isometry of linear fans ; it left the door open for two associahedra classified as different still being equivalent if a linear transformation of the normal fan is allowed ( see remark  [ rem : gen - associahedra - class ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we show that two hohlweg ",
    "lange associahedra coming from non - equivalent sign sequences can be distinguished by their pairs of parallel facets ( see the proof of theorem  [ thm : classification_hl ] ) .",
    "the fact that hohlweg ",
    "lange asociahedra have parallel facets is obvious from the definitions , but was not used in  @xcite . the same works for santos asociahedra : if two of them are produced by non - equivalent triangulations , then they are not normally isomorphic ( lemma  [ lemma : triangmany_distinct ] ) .",
    "even more so , the only hohlweg  lange associahedron with the same pairs of parallel facets as a santos associahedron is the chapoton  fomin  zelevinsky associahedron . that is to say ( theorem  [ theo : almost - disjoint ] ) :    [ thm : main ] the hohlweg  lange and santos families of associahedra are almost disjoint , the only common element being the chapoton  fomin",
    " zelevinsky associahedron .",
    "the secondary polytope construction of the associahedron has a completely different flavor , since a continuous deformation of the polygon produces a continuous deformation of the associahedron obtained and of its normal fan .",
    "moreover , the secondary polytope of a convex polygon never has parallel facets ( proposition  [ prop : par_cont^i ] , already noticed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "this difference is apparent comparing figures  [ fig : hex - secondary ] and  [ fig : manyassociahedra ] .    in section  [ sec : combinatorial_c - cluster_complex ]",
    "we relate the santos construction with the @xmath2-cluster complexes and the denominator fans in cluster algebras of type @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath2-cluster complexes are simplicial complexes defined by reading in  @xcite following ideas from  @xcite .",
    "we obtain a simple combinatorial description of these complexes for coxeter groups of type @xmath3 , and show that they are the normal fans of some of the santos associahedra ( proposition  [ prop : c - cluster_fan ] ) . in the general case ,",
    "the normal fans of the santos associahedra can be interpreted as the denominator fans in cluster algebras of type @xmath3  ( proposition  [ prop : denominator_fan ] ) .",
    "this connection suggests a natural generalization of the santos construction to a construction of generalized cluster - associahedra in arbitrary finite coxeter groups ( question  [ question : coxetercatalanassociahedra ] ) .",
    "let us remark that , even if both the hohlweg  lange and the santos constructions have very natural interpretations ( and generalizations , modulo the question above ) in the context of finite coxeter groups , they have a significant difference ; their normal fans lie in the _ root space _ and the _ weight space _ respectively .",
    "this is a bit hidden in figure  [ fig : manyassociahedra ] , where we have performed a linear transformation to draw the polytopes inscribed in the same cube .",
    "one of the questions that remains is whether there is a common generalization of the hohlweg ",
    "lange and the santos construction , which may perhaps produce even more examples of `` combinatorial '' associahedra .",
    "an exhaustive search produces , besides the four @xmath17-associahedra of figure  [ fig : manyassociahedra ] , another four @xmath17-associahedra that arise by cutting three faces of a @xmath17-cube ( see figure  [ fig : moreassociahedra ] ) .",
    "do these admit a natural combinatorial interpretation as well ?    [ width=0.85 ]",
    "moreassociahedra    as a final remark , part of the motivation of this paper was to try to find out _ what is the most `` natural '' or `` canonical '' realization of the associahedron_. the answer is not clear . if one wants to realize all the combinatorial symmetries of the polytope ( which , as we show in lemma  [ lemma : automorphism_rotation - reflection ] , are precisely the dihedral symmetries of the @xmath5-gon ) then the best candidate is the secondary polytope of a regular polygon ( figure  [ fig : hex - secondary ] ) .",
    "but if small integer coordinates for vertices and facet normals are seeked then you certainly want one of the hohlweg  lange or santos associahedra ( figure  [ fig : manyassociahedra ] ) . among them",
    ", the loday associahedron sticks out as the most ubiquitous in the literature  @xcite , but the chapoton  fomin ",
    "zelevinsky associahedron is the only one produced both by the hohlweg ",
    "lange and the santos constructions .",
    "let @xmath18 be a convex @xmath5-gon . an _ associahedron _ @xmath19 is an @xmath0-dimensional simple polytope whose poset of non - empty faces is isomorphic to the poset of non - crossing sets of diagonals of @xmath18 , ordered by reverse inclusion .",
    "in particular , the vertices of the associahedron correspond to the _ _",
    "triangulations__  of  @xmath18 and its facets to the internal diagonals .",
    "the goal of this paper is to compare different types of constructions of the associahedron , saying which ones produce equivalent polytopes , in a suitable sense .",
    "the following notion reflects the fact that the main constructions that we are going to discuss produce associahedra whose normal vectors have small integer coordinates , usually @xmath20 or @xmath21 . in these constructions",
    "the normal fan of the associahedron can be considered canonical , while there is still freedom in the right - hand sides of the inequalities .",
    "recall that the normal fan of a polytope @xmath22 is the partition of @xmath23 into the normal cones of the different faces of @xmath24 .",
    "each @xmath25-dimensional cone ( ray ) in the normal fan is generated by the ( exterior ) normal vector to a facet of @xmath24 and the @xmath0-dimensional cones are normal to the vertices of @xmath24 .",
    "since all the polytopes in this paper are simple , their normal fans are _ simplicial _ : every cone is generated by an independent set of vectors .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.1 ) for further discussion of fans and of normal fans . )",
    "this leads us to use the following notion of equivalence .",
    "[ def : nl - equivalent ] two complete fans in real vector spaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the same dimension are _ linearly isomorphic _ if there is a linear isomorphism @xmath28 sending each cone of one to a cone of the other .",
    "two polytopes @xmath24 and @xmath29 are _ _ normally isomorphic__  if they have linearly isomorphic normal fans .",
    "normal isomorphism is weaker than the usual notion of _ normal equivalence _ , in which the two polytopes @xmath24 and @xmath29 are assumed embedded _ in the same space _ and their normal fans are required to be exactly the same , not only linearly isomorphic .",
    "one easy way to check that two polytopes are _ not _ normally isomorphic is to show that no combinatorial isomorphism sends parallel facets of one to parallel facets of the other .",
    "the following lemma is very useful in order to disprove that two associahedra are normally isomorphic .",
    "it implies that all normal ( or combinatorial , for that matter ) isomorphisms between associahedra come from isomorphisms between the @xmath5-gons defining them .",

    "the second sentence follows from the first one since the only symmetry of the @xmath32-gon sending every diagonal to itself is the identity , for @xmath33 . for the first sentence , suppose @xmath34 is an automorphism of the face lattice of the associahedron @xmath19 , and let @xmath35 be the set of all diagonals of a convex @xmath5-gon .",

    "since the length of @xmath40 is determined by the number of diagonals that cross @xmath40 , @xmath41    now , two diagonals of the @xmath5-gon have a common vertex if and only if there is a diagonal of length @xmath42 crossing both of them . in particular , @xmath43 sends diagonals with a common vertex to diagonals with common vertex and can thus be understood as a graph automorphism of @xmath35 , when @xmath35 is regarded as the graph @xmath44 ( the complete graph minus the hamiltonian cycle along the boundary of the @xmath5-gon ) .",

    "but in type @xmath3 , clusters correspond to triangulations and the denominator fan with seed triangulation @xmath203 is nothing but the normal fan of the associahedron  @xmath372 ( see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",

    "hence , as a consequence of theorem  [ thm : triangmany_fan ] and theorem  [ thm : triangmany_regular ] we obtain :    [ prop : denominator_fan ] for cluster algebras of type @xmath8 ,    the denominator fan associated to any triangulation @xmath203 of a convex @xmath5-gon is a complete simplicial fan , and    it is the normal fan of a polytope ( the associahedron  @xmath372 ) .",
    "this result suggests a natural generalization of the santos construction of associahedra to arbitrary finite coxeter groups :    [ question : coxetercatalanassociahedra ] given an arbitrary cluster seed in a cluster algebra of finite type    is the associated denominator fan a complete simplicial fan ?",
