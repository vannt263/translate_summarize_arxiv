    "much attention has been devoted to the electron spin dynamics in semiconductors for the past three decades.@xcite especially , recent experiments have shown extremely long spin lifetime ( up to hundreds of nanoseconds ) in @xmath0-type bulk zinc - blende semiconductors ( such as gaas).@xcite moreover , a lot more investigations have been performed on various low dimensional systems,@xcite and spin lifetime as long as tens of nanoseconds has been reported in ( 110)-oriented gaas quantum wells ( qws)@xcite at room temperature and in @xmath7-type gaas : be / al@xmath8ga@xmath9as double hetero - structures@xcite at low temperature . in these studies , understanding the spin relaxation / dephasing ( r / d ) mechanism is one of the most important problems as it is the prerequisite for the application of the spintronic devices .",
    "it is understood that the dayakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism is the leading spin r / d mechanism in @xmath0-type zinc - blende semiconductors.@xcite this mechanism is composed of the contribution from the dresselhaus term,@xcite which is due to the lack of inversion symmetry in the zinc - blende crystal brillouin zone ( sometimes referred to as the bulk inversion asymmetry ) , and that from the rashba term,@xcite which originates from the asymmetric potential within a qw along the growth direction ( sometimes referred to as the structure inversion asymmetry ) .",
    "both appear as effective magnetic fields . for narrow ( 001 )",
    "gaas qw without the additional large bias voltage , the dresselhaus term is the leading term:@xcite    @xmath10    in which @xmath11 represents the average of the operator @xmath12 over the electronic state of the lowest subband . under the finite square well assumption , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the lowest energy solutions of the equations @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denoting the well depth , well width and the effective mass respectively , in the limiting case , @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the spin splitting parameter.@xcite there are a lot of theoretical investigations on the spin r / d due to the dp mechanism lately.@xcite most of them are within the framework of single - particle approximation and the coulomb scattering is thought to be irrelevant in the spin r / d .",

    "the feature is more complicated when @xmath26.@xcite in above studies,@xcite we have been focusing on the high temperature regime ( @xmath27  k ) where the electron - acoustic ( ac ) phonon scattering , which is more complicated in numerical calculation than the electron - longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon scattering , is negligible . in this paper",

    "moreover , we compare the spin relaxation time ( srt ) obtained from our theory with the experimental data over a wide temperature regime and show the excellent agreement of our theory with the experiment .",

    ". @xcite it is interesting to note that unlike our previous works focusing on high temperatures ( @xmath116k),@xcite the situation is more complicated at low temperatures . at low / medium electron densities [ fig .",
    "2(a)/(b ) ] , the srt presents a peak at very low temperature ( near 20@xmath11730  k)/low temperature ( around 41  k ) and a valley around @xmath118  k ; whereas at high electron density [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] , the srt increases monotonically with @xmath96 .",
    "it is noted that at very low temperature ( around 20  k ) the electron - ac phonon scattering is negligible.@xcite @xmath119 from the electron - ac phonon scattering is around @xmath120  ps , two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath121 from the electron - electron coulomb scattering .",
    "in addition , @xmath122 from the impurity scattering is around 2  ps , one order of magnitude larger than @xmath121 , and has a very weak temperature dependence .",
    "therefore , the appearance of the peaks in fig .",
    "2(a ) originates from the electron - electron coulomb scattering which dominates the scattering process .",
    "moreover , @xmath121 is a nonmonotonic function of temperature : @xmath123 at low temperature ( degenerate limit ) and @xmath124 at high temperature ( nondegenerate limit).@xcite the minimum of @xmath121 corresponds to the crossover from the degenerate limit to the nondegenerate one at @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126  k when @xmath111  @xmath5 , in good agreement with the peaks obtained from our calculation with the exact coulomb scattering",
    ". therefore the srt increases / decreases with the temperature ( and the coulomb scattering ) in the degenerate / nondegenerate regime .",
    "once @xmath127  k , the electron - lo phonon scattering becomes comparable with the coulomb scattering and strengthens so rapidly with temperature that it completely surpasses the weak temperature dependence of the coulomb scattering : @xmath128 from the electron - lo phonon scattering varies from several picoseconds at @xmath118  k to several tenths of picosecond at @xmath129  k , and @xmath121 varies from @xmath130  ps to several picoseconds",
    ". therefore the srt increases with @xmath96 .",
    "when the electron density is @xmath131  @xmath5 , @xmath132 is nearly @xmath133  k. around this temperature , the electron - ac phonon scattering can not be overlooked although @xmath119 is still roughly one order of magnitude larger than @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the reduction of the coulomb scattering after @xmath132 can be partly compensated by the increase of the electron - phonon scattering . as a result",
    ", one can see that the decrease of the srt after @xmath132 in fig .",
    "2(b ) is much slower than that in fig .",
    "however , when the electron density is high enough , say @xmath134  @xmath5 in fig .",

    "the electron - phonon scattering becomes comparable to the coulomb scattering and the strengthening rate of phonon scattering around this temperature is large enough to completely compensate , and even surpass , the weakening rate of the coulomb scattering .",
    "consequently the total scattering increases monotonously with @xmath96",
    ". therefore the srt increases monotonically with @xmath96 .",
    "we further show the effect of the coulomb scattering on the spin relaxation .",
    "this was first proposed by wu and ning based on the inhomogeneous broadening induced by the energy dependence of the @xmath136-factor.@xcite then , we used our full microscopic approach and showed that the coulomb scattering makes marked contribution to the spin r / d when @xmath116  k when the inhomogeneous broadening is induced by the dp term.@xcite at low temperature ( @xmath137  k ) , glazov and ivchenko used perturbation method to show that the second - order coulomb scattering causes the srt.@xcite in the perturbation approach , the coulomb scattering contributes marginally to the spin r / d at high temperature . in our calculation",
    ", we include the coulomb scattering to all orders of the bubble diagrams as well as the counter effect of the coulomb scattering to the inhomogeneous broadening . in fig .  2 by plotting the srt for the case of @xmath138 , but without the coulomb scattering , as dashed curves ,",
    "we show that the coulomb scattering makes marked contribution to the spin r / d over the whole temperature regime by increasing the spin r / d time.@xcite it is further seen from figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) that the peak disappears without the coulomb scattering .",
    "this is consistent with the previous discussion .",
    "it is interesting to see that in the absence of the coulomb scattering , the criterion for strong scattering regime @xmath23 is satisfied only when @xmath139  k. therefore the srt increases with @xmath96 when @xmath116  k. when @xmath140  k , @xmath141 is slightly smaller than @xmath130 , which is the intermediate scattering regime .",
    "the variation of the srt depends on the competition between the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening and the increase of the scattering with the temperature.@xcite for low / high electron density case , the temperature dependence of the electron - ac phonon scattering is less / more effective and the srt decreases / increases with @xmath96 .",
    "it is noted that in order to see the peaks at low electron density , it is important to have a high mobility sample ( low impurity density ) .",
    "this is because the ascendancy of the coulomb scattering can be impaired when the impurity scattering gets large enough and the total scattering is mainly determined by the impurity scattering .",
    "as the electron - impurity scattering depends weakly on the temperature , the temperature dependence of the inhomogeneous broadening from the dp term becomes the only variable element .",
    "therefore the srt decreases monotonically with @xmath96 as the solid curves with triangles in fig .  2 for the case of @xmath142 .",
    "this condition is not satisfied in the experiment by ohno _",
    "et al._,@xcite and this is the reason why there is no peak in fig .  1 .",
    "however , apart from the peaks which are not observed yet , both the experiment and calculation show that the srt decreases with temperature at low electron densities when @xmath137  k. the srt at high electron density increases monotonically with temperature when the impurity density is low , which is also in agreement with the latest experiment by harley _",
    "et al._@xcite    finally we investigate the well width dependence of the srt . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the srt versus temperature at well widths @xmath65  nm ( solid curves ) and 15  nm ( dashed curves ) respectively .",
    "we choose low and high impurity densities @xmath143 ( curves with dots ) and @xmath144 ( curves with triangles ) as well as low and high electron densities @xmath111  @xmath5 ( a ) and @xmath145  @xmath5 ( b ) .",
    "it is noted that the srt is enhanced by increasing the well width as @xmath146 in the dp term decreases with the increase of @xmath19 . moreover , as impurities further enhance the srt , it reaches to several nanoseconds at very low temperatures at high impurity density .",
    "we now turn to investigating the hot - electron effect on spin relaxation at low temperature .",
    "an electric field is applied parallel to the qw .",
    "similar to our previous investigation,@xcite electrons obtain a center - of - mass drift velocity ( and consequently an effective magnetic field proportional to the electric field ) and are heated to a temperature @xmath147 higher than @xmath96 .",
    "the numerical schemes of solving the hot electron problem has been laid out in detail in ref .",
    ".@xcite we plot the electric field dependence of the srt with @xmath148  nm and @xmath149  k for different impurity densities at low / high electron density ( @xmath111  @xmath5/@xmath145  @xmath5 ) in fig .",
    "4(a)/(b ) . in the calculation , the magnetic field @xmath150  t and the spin splitting parameter @xmath110 as in the previous section .",
    "it is seen from the figure that unlike the high temperature case investigated before@xcite ( and also see fig .",
    "4(c ) for @xmath151  k ) where the electric field can be applied easily to around 1  kv / cm , at low temperatures it can be applied only to a very small value due to the `` runaway '' effect.@xcite this is because at low temperature , the efficient electron - lo phonon scattering is missing and electrons are therefore very easily driven to very high momentum states by a very small electric field .",
    "it is interesting to see from the figure that differing from the high temperature case where the srt _ increases _ with the electric field ( see fig .  4 ( c ) and also ref .  ) , here , for the case of low electron densities , the srt _ decreases _ with the field and for the case of high electron densities , the srt decreases / increases with the field at high / low impurity densities .",
    "these features at low temperature @xmath96 can be understood from the joint effects of the electric field @xmath91 to the scattering strength and the inhomogeneous broadening due to the dp term .",
    "on one hand , when the electric field is small , the ionized - impurity scattering , whose strength decreases slightly with the electron temperature @xmath147 , is dominant . when the electric field is further increased , @xmath147 and therefore the electron - ac phonon scattering is raised .",
    "if the impurity scattering is not too high , the electron - ac phonon scattering can then be dominant as discussed decades ago in ref .  .",
    "these can be seen from the mobilities @xmath152 obtained from our calculation , which are plotted in the same figure for all the corresponding cases .",
    "one can see that @xmath153 increases slightly and monotonically with @xmath91 for the impurity - scattering - dominant case such as @xmath142 ; it decreases monotonically with @xmath91 for the case of very low / no impurity scattering such as @xmath154 , as the electron - ac phonon scattering always increases with the electron temperature @xmath147 ; for the case of low impurity scattering such as @xmath155 , @xmath153 first increases slightly then decreases with @xmath91 which shows the transition from the impurity - scattering - dominant regime to the electron - ac - phonon - scattering - dominant regime@xcite ( unless the runaway effect blocks the system to the later regime as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) for the case of low electron densities ) . on the other hand ,",
    "electrons are driven to the higher momentum states by the electric field and experience a larger effective magnetic field [ eqs .",
    "( [ omegax]-[omegaz ] ) ] . therefore the inhomogeneous broadening is increased .",
    "this tends to decrease the srt . in order to show the electric field dependence of the inhomogeneous broadening , we plot in fig .",
    "5 the electron temperature @xmath147 as a function of electric field @xmath91 for all the corresponding cases in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is obvious from fig .  5 that the increase of @xmath147 for the low electron density case is much faster than that for the high one .",
    "therefore , the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening is the leading contribution in comparison with the electric field effect on the scattering .",
    "consequently , the srt decreases with @xmath91 for the case of low electron densities as shown in fig .",
    "for the case of high electron densities , when the impurity density is high such as @xmath144 in fig .",
    "4(b ) , both the slight decrease of the scattering and the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening tend to suppress the srt .",
    "when the impurity density is low / zero , the strengthening of the scattering is dominant ( as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) the decrease of mobility with @xmath91 ) in comparison with the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this makes the srt decrease with @xmath91",
    ". finally we point out that the coulomb scattering plays an essential role in the spin r / d in the presence of the electric field .",
    "it determines the hot - electron temperature @xmath147 which controls the inhomogeneous broadening and the scattering strengths .",
    "moreover , the coulomb scattering itself also contributes to the spin r / d .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot the srt versus electric field at high temperature @xmath156  k for both low and high electron densities with @xmath143 in fig .",
    "at this temperature , the electron - lo phonon scattering is dominant",
    ". therefore @xmath153 always decrease with @xmath91 . for the well width and electron density",
    "we study , the linear dp term is dominant and the increase of the scattering is more important .",
    "therefore the srt increases with @xmath91 .",
    "for qws with larger well width so that the cubic term is dominant , the srt can decrease with @xmath91 as reported in our previous work at high temperatures.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have investigated the temperature dependence of the srt for @xmath0-type gaas ( 001 ) qws with small well widths from a full microscopic approach by constructing and numerically solving the kinetic spin bloch equations with all the relevant scattering explicitly included .",
    "in contrast to our previous studies at high temperatures ( @xmath27  k ) , we include the electron - ac phonon scattering which is absent in our previous studies so that we may extend the scope of our approach to the low temperature regime ( @xmath140 k ) .",
    "good agreement with experiment data@xcite is obtained from our theory over almost the _ whole _ temperature regime by using only one fitting parameter @xmath22 whose value agrees with many experimental and theoretical results . we show that the coulomb scattering plays an essential role in spin r / d over all the temperature regime .    for qws with low electron densities but high mobility ( _ i.e. _ , low impurity density ) ,",
    "the spin r / d is mainly controlled by the electron - electron coulomb scattering when @xmath157  k. we predict a peak in the @xmath90-@xmath96 curve .",
    "the closer the peak approaches the high temperature limit , the smoother the peak appears .",
    "after the peak , the srt increases with temperature .",
    "finally , such a peak disappears at sufficient high electron density where the srt increases monotonically with temperature .",
    "we point out that the peak origins from the coulomb scattering . specifically , it origins from the different temperature dependences of the coulomb scattering at the degenerate and the nondegenerate limits with the transition temperature @xmath158 . for low electron densities , @xmath159  k where the electron - phonon scattering is negligible",
    ". then one may observe an abrupt peak around @xmath132 . for medium electron densities ,",
    "@xmath160  k@xmath161  k where the increase of the electron - ac phonon scattering partially compensates the decrease of the coulomb scattering when @xmath96 increases , one may observe a smooth peak around @xmath132 .",
    "nevertheless , for high electron densities , @xmath162  k , the increase of the electron - phonon scattering completely compensates the decrease of the coulomb scattering when @xmath96 rises .",
    "consequently the peak disappears .    at high temperature ( @xmath116  k ) and low impurity density ,",
    "when the well width is small so that the cubic terms in the dp terms are unimportant , the increase of electron - lo phonon scattering surpasses the increase of inhomogeneous broadening with temperature , so that the srt increases with temperature .",
    "however , when the impurity density is so high that electron - impurity scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism , the srt decreases monotonically with temperature for any electron density .",
    "this is because the temperature dependence of the electron - impurity scattering is very weak and the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening with temperature dominates the temperature dependence of the srt .",
    "we also show that larger well width leads to a slower spin relaxation .",
    "moreover , in the strong scattering limit , higher impurity density also leads to a slower spin relaxation .",

    "the effect of electric field ( _ i.e. _ , the hot electron effect ) on the spin relaxation is also investigated .",
    "we show that the electric field dependence of the srt at low temperature appears again quite differently from that at high temperature due to the absence of electron - lo phonon scattering .",
