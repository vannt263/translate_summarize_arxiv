    "relativistic hydrodynamics provides a convenient tool to analyse relativistic heavy ion collision data .",
    "it is assumed that a fireball is created in the collisions .",
    "constituents of the fireball collide frequently to establish local thermal equilibrium sufficiently fast and after a certain time @xmath8 , hydrodynamics become applicable .",
    "if the macroscopic properties of the fluid e.g. energy density , pressure , velocity etc . are known at the equilibration time @xmath8 , the relativistic hydrodynamic equations can be solved to give the space - time evolution of the fireball till a given freeze - out condition such that interaction between the constituents is too weak to continue the evolution . using suitable algorithm ( e.g. cooper - frye ) information at the freeze - out can be converted into particle spectra and can be directly compared with experimental data .",
    "thus , hydrodynamics , in an indirect way , can characterize the initial condition of the medium produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "hydrodynamics equations are closed only with an equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "it is one of the most important inputs of a hydrodynamic model . through this",
    "input macroscopic hydrodynamic models make contact with the microscopic world and one can investigate the possibility of phase transition in the medium .",
    "most of the hydrodynamical calculations are performed with eos with a 1st order phase transition .",
    "for example , in @xcite , 1st order eos , eos - q was used to successfully analyse a host of experimental data in au+au collisions at rhic . in eos - q ,",
    "the deconfined or the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase is modeled by a bag equation of state of non - interacting quarks and gluons , the confined or the hadronic phase is modeled by a non - interacting gas of hadronic resonances .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics analysis with eos - q indicate that in central au+au collisions , at the equilibration time @xmath9 0.6 fm , central energy density of the qgp fluid is @xmath1030 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , lattice simulations @xcite indicate that the confinement - deconfinement transition is neither a 1st nor a 2nd order phase transition , rather a cross - over at @xmath4=196 mev .",
    "it is then important that lattice based eos are used in hydrodynamic analysis of rhic data , more so when we are trying to verify the lattice prediction about confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "one also note that ideal hydrodynamic predictions for the initial energy density or temperature of the fluid produced in au+au collisions is not creditable as dissipative effects are not included . in hydrodynamics ,",
    "initial energy density or temperature of the fluid is obtained by fitting experimental data on particle production , e.g. pion multiplicity , @xmath12 spectra etc . , which essentially measure the final state entropy . unlike in ideal fluid evolution , where initial and final state entropy remains the same , in viscous fluid evolution entropy is generated .",
    "consequently , to produce a fixed final state entropy , viscous fluid require less initial entropy density ( or energy density ) than an ideal fluid .",
    "recently , we have constructed an lattice based eos and use it to explain the @xmath3 meson production in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "recent lattice simulation results @xcite were parameterised to obtain eos of the deconfined state .",
    "the confined part of the eos corresponds to that of a hadronic resonance gas with all the resonances with mass @xmath132.5 gev .",
    "the deconfined and the confined part of the eos were smoothly joined at a cross - over temperature @xmath4=196 mev . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the lattice based eos reasonably well explain the centrality dependence of @xmath3 mesons multiplicity ( @xmath14 ) , mean @xmath12 ( @xmath15 ) and integrated elliptic flow ( @xmath16 ) . from a simultaneous fit to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 an estimate of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio was obtained , @xmath5=0.07 @xmath17 0.03 @xmath17 0.14 , the first uncertainty is due to uncertainty in star measurements , the 2nd one is due to uncertain initial condition e.g. initial time varying between @xmath8=0.2 - 0.6 fm ) , freeze - out temperature varying between @xmath18=130 - 150 mev , initial velocity ( @xmath19 , @xmath20=0.0 - 0.06 ) , inaccuracy in hydrodynamic evolution code etc .",
    "strange meson @xmath3 constitute only a very small fraction of the total particles produced in au+au collisions .",
    "particle production is dominated by pions , kaons and protons etc .",
    "for example , in central au+au collisions , pions constitute nearly @xmath780% of the total particle yield , kaons @xmath7 13% and protons @xmath7 5% .",
    "@xmath3 mesons contribute @xmath7 2% to the total yield .",
    "it is then important to inquire whether or not hydrodynamics with the lattice based eos is consistent with the experimental data on other particles , e.g. pion , kaon , proton etc .",
    "the estimate of viscosity as obtained in @xcite will not be creditable unless the model also reproduces bulk of the particles , i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath1 , proton etc . in the present paper , with the same parameters as in @xcite , we have analysed transverse momentum spectra of identified particles , e.g. @xmath0 , @xmath1 , proton and @xmath3 in au+au collisions over a wide range ( 0 - 60% ) of collision centrality . in central and mid central collisions , hydrodynamic evolution of minimally viscous fluid best",
    "explain the data .",
    "nearly equilvalent description is also obtained in ideal fluid evolution . however , description to the data in evolution with viscosity @xmath21 is considerably poor than that in ideal or minimally viscous fluid .",

    "we have neglected resonance production .",
    "however , resonance contribution to proton is very small and even if resonances are included , model predictions will not agree with the experiment .",
    "inability of the model to correctly predict proton spectra is possibly due to the neglect of baryons in the model .",
    "we have assumed a baryon free fluid . however , the matter produced in au+au collisions at rhic are not entirely baryon free .",
    "note that with baryons in the fluid , proton production will depend exponentially on the chemical potential .",
    "even a small chemical potential at the freeze - out will considerably enhance proton production .",
    "inability of the model to correctly predict @xmath12-spectra of proton may also be due to the equation of state used presently .",
    "the equation of state is a combination of a recent lattice simulation @xcite and non interacting hadron resonance gas .",
    "the lattice simulation was performed with two light quark and a heavier strange quark .",
    "light quark masses that are nearly twice the physical masses , the strange quark mass was adjusted to its physical value .",
    "consequently , pion is heavy , @xmath57220 mev and kaon mass is physical @xmath58503 mev @xcite .",
    "though it is not mentioned in @xcite , we expects that protons are also heavier than the physical ones .",
    "then in the lattice based eos the confined phase is a fluid of heavy pions and protons but physical kaons . at the freeze - out fluid cells",
    "will contain less number of heavier protons than it would have otherwise and proton production will be reduced .",
    "pion production will also be reduced , however , being a lighter particle , the effect of heavy pion mass will be less pronounced .",
    "for example , if we approximate @xmath59 , then in the @xmath12 range 1 - 3 gev , for @xmath7 50% increase in pion mass , production is reduced only by 3 - 10% . for a similar increase in proton mass production",
    "is reduced by 60 - 90% . indeed ,",
    "even if proton is only 20% heavier than physical proton , proton production is reduced by 30 - 60% in the @xmath12 range 1 - 3 gev .",
    "more detailed study is needed to understand the proton spectra .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have initialised the fluid ( ideal or viscous ) to reproduce @xmath3 meson multiplicity in 0 - 5% au+au collisions . in fig.[f6 ] , @xmath3 meson s @xmath12 spectra are studied .",

    "in all the collision centrality , @xmath50 is minimum in ideal fluid evolution . @xmath50",
    "s are comparatively larger in minimamly viscous fluid evolution . for @xmath5=0.12 or 0.16 ,",
    "compared to ideal fluid , in viscous fluid evolution , @xmath50 increases by a factor of 3 - 6 .    in fig.[f7 ] , we have shown the @xmath50 values for the combined data sets ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "collision centrality upto 30 - 40% are included only .",
    "as indicated earlier , hydrodynamic description to the data gets poorer beyond this collision centrality . in fig.[f7 ] , the filled square are the @xmath50 of the combined data sets , as a function of viscosity @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath50 analysis definitely indicate that identified particle @xmath12 spectra do not demand large viscosity .",
    "minimum @xmath60 is obtained in minimally viscous evolution .",
    "but comparable description to the data is also obtained in ideal fluid evolution . in fig.[f7 ] , the filled circles are the @xmath50 when proton data are excluded from the analysis .",

    "ideal hydrodynamics give comparable fit .",
    "the results are consistent with recent estimate of qgp viscosity @xcite . in @xcite analysing @xmath3 meson data , it was concluded that nearly perfect fluid is produced in au+au collisions at rhic energy .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of identified particles also lead to similar conclusions , in au+au collisions , a nearly perfect fluid is produced .    before we summarise our results ,",
    "it is important to mention that we have neglected bulk viscosity . experimental data , which include the effect of bulk viscosity , if there is any . in general ,",
    "bulk viscosity is an order of magnitude smaller than shear viscosity .",
    "but in qgp , it is possible that near the cross - over temperature , bulk viscosity is large @xcite .",
    "effect of bulk viscosity on particle spectra and elliptic flow is studied in @xcite .",
    "it appears that even if small , bulk viscosity can have visible effect on particle spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "neglect of bulk viscosity , will artificially increase the effect of ( shear ) viscosity .",
    "in other word , if bulk viscosity is included , comparable fits to the data can be obtained with still lower value of @xmath5 .",
    "to summarise , in a hydrodynamical model , where the evolution is governed by a lattice based equation of state with a confinement - deconfinement cross - over at temperature @xmath4=196 mev , we have analysed the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles , e.g. pions , kaons , protons and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "it is assumed that au+au collisions produce a baryon free ideal / viscous fluid .",
    "ideal or viscous ( @xmath5=0.08 - 0.16 ) fluid was initialised to reproduce @xmath3 meson multiplicity in a central ( 0 - 5% ) au+au collision .",
    "hydrodynamic evolution of the ideal or minimally viscous ( @xmath5=0.08 ) fluid , initialised to reproduce @xmath3 multiplicity in 0 - 5% au+au collisions , reasonably well reproduces transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 in central and mid - central collisions . in peripheral collisions , 40 - 50% and beyond",
    ", the description to the data gets poorer .",
    "description to the that data is also poor in evolution of fluid with viscosity larger than the ads / cft limit .",
    "hydrodynamical evolution of baryon free ideal or viscous fluid however do not generate enough protons to agree with experiment .",
    "proton spectra are underpredicted by a factor of 2 .",
    "poor fit to the proton data is possibly due to the neglect of baryons in the model .",
    "fluid produced in au+au collisions at @xmath62=200 gev is not entirely baryon free .",
    "it is expected that the fits to proton data will improve if baryons are included in the model .",
    "poor fit to proton data may also be due to comparatively large light quark masses in lattice simulation .",
    "light quarks are approximately twice the mass of physical quarks , consequently protons are heavy .",
    "more detailed study is need to sort out the issue .",
    "our analysis also indicate that the transverse momentum spectra of the combined data set , ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) or ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 ) , in 0 - 40% collision centrality are best explained in minimally viscous fluid .",
