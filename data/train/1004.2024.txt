    "much can be learned about the bulk properties of the medium created in relativistic heavy ion collisions by studying the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles .",
    "typically , the dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath2 with respect to the collision plane is written as a fourier series @xmath3.\\ ] ] in a collision between identical nuclei at midrapidity , the sine terms and all odd terms are negligible when averaged over many events",
    ". there has been much study of the elliptic flow coefficient , @xmath1  @xcite , which has been an important observable for determining , e.g. , the viscosity of the medium  @xcite .",
    "less studied , however is the next harmonic @xmath4  @xcite . in this article",
    "we use viscous and ideal hydrodynamic simulations to determine what @xmath4 can tell us about the heavy ion collision fireball created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , and to make predictions for planned heavy ion collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    for details of the hydrodynamic model used",
    ", the reader is directed to ref .  @xcite . as a brief summary , we solve 2 + 1 dimensional conformal viscous hydrodynamic equations ( with zero bulk viscosity ) using both glauber- and cgc - type initial conditions and a cooper - frye freeze out routine followed by resonance feed down .",
    "all calculations use the same parameters as those that gave the best fit to rhic data  @xcite ( see table [ tab : par ] ) , except where specified .",
    ".[tab]parameters used for the viscous hydrodynamics simulations except as indicated in each relevant section .",
    "the bold faced lines give the best fit to @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and multiplicity  @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "first recall the simplest prediction for @xmath4  @xcite that predicts @xmath6 for a boosted thermal freeze out distribution . to summarize , in the low temperature limit",
    ", one can solve the zero - viscosity cooper - frye freeze out formula with boltzmann statistics @xmath7 by performing a saddle point approximation . at large transverse momentum ( i.e. , where the minimum of @xmath8 ) , the dominant part of the integral comes from the part of the freeze out surface where the fluid velocity is parallel to the momentum of the emitted particle , and is at a maximum .",
    "we can decompose this maximum fluid 4-velocity magnitude @xmath9 at each angle @xmath2 in a fourier series @xmath10 plugging this into eq .   in a saddle point approximation and expanding to leading order in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one obtains @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 . at a large enough @xmath16 , the first term in eq",
    ".   dominates , and it is in this sense that it can be said that @xmath4 is largely generated by an intrinsic elliptic flow ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) rather than a fourth order moment of the fluid flow ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "as one relaxes the large @xmath16 limit , the ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath17 should have corrections from @xmath18 that depend on the particular collision , but behave as @xmath19 ( or equivalently @xmath20 ) .",
    "this derivation is the motivation for studying the quantity @xmath0 rather than @xmath4 alone , and is the quantity to be studied here .",
    "equation is quite general and does not depend on the details of the freeze out surface or the fluid flow that produces it",
    ". it should be noted , however , that several assumptions must be made in order to derive it : small temperature , large transverse momentum , small @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and zero viscosity .",
    "as these restrictions are relaxed , the behavior becomes more complicated and more sensitive to details .",
    "therefore , in order to fully understand the final results of the most realistic simulations as well as to make contact with previous results from ideal hydrodynamics and transport simulations , it will be useful to gain insight by starting with the simple case of vanishing viscosity and low freeze out temperature , and then adding viscosity and a realistic freeze out temperature once the generic features of the simpler case are understood .",
    "@xmath4 has been measured at rhic by both the star @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations .",
    "they both find a significant deviation of @xmath0 from a constant 1/2 .",
    "rather , the reported value of the ratio is close to a constant value of 1 for a large range of transverse momentum ( @xmath21 mev )  @xcite , centrality ( @xmath221070% )  @xcite , and for all identified particles that have been measured ( pions , kaons , and protons  @xcite ) . it is larger for more central events , while there is no clear consensus for small @xmath16 and very peripheral events .",
    "the results from phenix tend to be somewhat smaller than from star , likely indicating different sensitivities to non - flow effects , although all results are still well above 0.5 .",
    "much of this discrepancy between prediction and experiment can be understood by noting that both @xmath4 and @xmath1 are averaged over many events before the ratio is taken .",
    "even if the ratio @xmath0 were exactly 1/2 in each event , any fluctuation event - by - event ( both at a given centrality and within a centrality bin ) will tend to increase the measured @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , using a glauber monte carlo model of eccentricity fluctuations can explain most of the difference , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . with this understanding ,",
    "all calculations here  since they lack fluctuations  should be understood as relating to measured data by an overall ( momentum independent ) multiplicative factor that depends on the centrality bin chosen .",
    "we begin by noting that , since @xmath4 tends to be much smaller than @xmath1 , numerical errors can be of greater concern .",
    "we estimated this uncertainty in two ways .",
    "first , we looked at the results at @xmath23 , where @xmath4 should be zero theoretically .",
    "however , the use of a square lattice as well as the presence of numerical / rounding errors results in a calculated @xmath4 that can be as much as @xmath24% of the value calculated at , e.g. , @xmath25 fm ( or a much smaller fraction of the value for more peripheral collisions . ) second , we reran a number of simulations with half the usual grid spacing ( 0.2 fm instead of 0.4 fm ) . similarly , we found that @xmath0 changed by less than 5%10% as long as we only considered collisions for @xmath26 56 fm .",
    "therefore , we only report the results for @xmath27 fm and larger . reliable results outside this range can be obtained with more computer time or a better hydrodynamics algorithm ( as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in addition to numerical uncertainties , there are several other concerns to keep in mind .",
    "although the results are numerically stable above @xmath280.20.3 gev , they are moderately sensitive to details ( e.g. , small changes in parameters or the neglect of resonance feed down ) up to @xmath220.51 gev , although they seem quite robust at larger @xmath16 . of course , one must also note that in reality the hydrodynamic description should break down at some large value of @xmath16 and therefore one has less and less confidence in the results as @xmath16 increases .",
    "however , it is not clear _ a priori _ where exactly this break down should occur , and so it is still useful to calculate quantities even at large @xmath16 . only comparison to data can then give information about this break down of the hydrodynamic description .",
    "none of these concerns should change the trends and conclusions reported here .",
    "figure [ fig : tf100ideal ] shows the results for pions with @xmath29 ( corresponding to ideal hydrodynamics ) , and all parameters as specified in table [ tab : par ] except a small freeze out temperature of 100 mev .",
    "as found previously in ideal hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite , @xmath0 approaches a constant value of roughly 1/2 at asymptotically large values of @xmath16 , and increases as 1/@xmath16 for decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to expectations and data , however , there is a definite dependence on impact parameter . part ",
    "but not all  of this dependence as well as the deviation from 1/2 can be understood by the fact that here @xmath1 is unphysically large , as we have turned off viscous effects .",
    "for example , with cgc initial conditions at @xmath30 fm and @xmath31 gev , @xmath1 reaches 70% .",
    "@xmath0 would then be expected to reach almost 0.62 instead of 0.50 at large @xmath16 if one assumes @xmath12 of the fluid to be negligible ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tf100ideal ] also makes it apparent that , unlike @xmath1 itself , the results for @xmath0 are quite insensitive to the initial eccentricity .",
    "although there is a dependence on impact parameter , it is small , and there is little difference for glauber and cgc initial conditions , despite having a very different initial eccentricity ( and therefore very different @xmath1 for the same viscosity ",
    "see , e.g. , figs . 4 and 8 of ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , cgc initial conditions , with a larger initial eccentricity , lead to a smaller value than glauber while more peripheral collisions have a larger value than more central collisions , despite also having a larger eccentricity .",
    "the effect of raising the freeze out temperature to a more realistic value can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfscan ] .",
    "the choice of freeze out temperature makes a significant difference to the shape of the @xmath0 curve .",
    "this sensitivity to @xmath32 is perhaps not a complete surprise , since it is known from transport calculations that adjusting the treatment of freeze out does affect @xmath4  @xcite . for @xmath33  mev",
    ", @xmath0 is very flat as a function of @xmath16 ( reminiscent of data ) , which is not the case when @xmath32 is significantly larger or smaller .",
    "it is interesting that this freeze out temperature is the same as gives the best fit of charged hadron multiplicity , @xmath34 , and @xmath1  @xcite in _ viscous _ hydrodynamics . note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfscan ] , viscosity has been neglected and so it corresponds to a @xmath1 that is larger than seen experimentally . nevertheless , recall that the initial eccentricity  and by extension the magnitude of @xmath1does not significantly effect @xmath0 , and so this coincidence may indeed be significant .",
    "figure [ fig:140identified ] shows the results from ideal hydrodynamics for identified particles when the freeze out temperature is raised to 140 mev .",
    "data show approximately the same value for identified particles in the measured momentum range  @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed in our calculation for @xmath35 11.5 gev , below which it begins to depend on the parameters of the simulation as well as increasing numerical error ( especially for the heavier particles for which @xmath36 ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig:140 ] shows the results of viscous hydrodynamic simulations for several impact parameters , with ideal hydrodynamics results included for comparison .",
    "also shown is experimental data from star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite . since eccentricity fluctuations increase @xmath0 by a factor @xmath37  @xcite ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath38 in each centrality bin using the phobos glauber monte carlo  @xcite , and scaled down the data by @xmath38 .",
    "this scaling removes most of the ( already small ) centrality dependence for both star and phenix in this centrality range : the residual centrality dependence is much smaller than in our ideal hydrodynamics results .",
    "the larger values of @xmath0 for star as compared to phenix can most likely be attributed to larger nonflow effects  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that different choices for the form of the viscous correction @xmath39 to the distribution function at freeze out can significantly change the shape of these curves ( see ref .",
    "several aspects seem to be universal for reasonable choices of @xmath39 , however .",
    "in contrast to expectations  @xcite as well as the results at low freeze out temperature ( not shown ) , viscosity does not universally increase the ration of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , in most cases at this realistic freeze out temperature , the value was found to decrease compared to ideal hydrodynamics . rather than making the agreement with data better ,",
    "viscosity tends to make it worse .",
    "in particular , the correction induced by viscous effects depends strongly on centrality : viscous effects are larger for the smaller systems created in peripheral collisions .",
    "it should be noted that choosing a @xmath39 with a weaker momentum dependence than the standard quadratic ansatz ( used in fig .",
    "[ fig:140 ] as well as all previous viscous hydrodynamics results ) can flatten these curves as well as reduce the strong impact parameter dependence ( even potentially reducing it beyond that of ideal hydrodynamics ) , and this could in principle provide information about the dynamics of the hadron resonance gas at freeze out  @xcite .",
    "using what we have learned from rhic , it is then possible to predict what will be seen in heavy ion collisions at the lhc . using the same values for @xmath40 , @xmath32 , and @xmath41 that led to the best fit of rhic data  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath42 was adjusted to reproduce the expected multiplicity at top - energy pb - pb collisions at the lhc , as were the appropriate nuclear parameters ( the same as for the lhc predictions in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for details . for reference",
    "@xmath42 is 420 mev and 390 mev for glauber and cgc initial conditions , respectively . )",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] . lhc results for ideal hydrodynamics are similar to rhic results with a lower freeze out temperature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tfscan ] ) .",
    "specifically , there is an increase at small @xmath16 and viscous corrections can be positive as well as negative .",
    "however , here the viscous corrections are much smaller than for realistic rhic simulations .",
    "this means that  unlike for rhic  the choice for the viscous correction to the non - equilibrium distribution function ( @xmath39 ) is relatively unimportant , and a comparatively robust prediction can be made , with just a correction factor expected from fluctuations put in by hand .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath0 in a centrality bin of 2060% is expected to be larger by a factor of @xmath221.34 . although there is some dependence on initial conditions and impact parameter , the results are very similar to those obtained for rhic , so it is reasonable to make the prediction that @xmath0 measured at the lhc will be similar to that measured at rhic , except for a small increase with decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "in summary , we presented calculations of @xmath0 from ideal and viscous hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions at rhic , as well as those planned at the lhc .",
    "we confirm previous results from low @xmath32 ideal hydrodynamics and transport calculations .",
    "this observable is found to be insensitive to initial eccentricity , but to depend strongly on the freeze - out temperature @xmath32 . in ideal hydrodynamics , the dependence on @xmath16",
    "is found to be flat  as in rhic data  only if @xmath32 is near 140  mev , which is precisely the value providing the best fit to @xmath16 spectra and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 was found to be the same for pions , kaons , and protons  also in accord with data .",
    "there is an unexpected dependence on impact parameter , however , that is not seen in data . including viscosity using the standard freeze out scheme causes both the shape of the curve as a function of @xmath16 and the dependence on impact parameter to deviate from what is seen in data ( although both aspects could potentially be fixed by using a more appropriate form for the viscous correction to the equilibrium distribution function at freeze out  see ref .",
