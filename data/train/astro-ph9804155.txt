    "observations as well as models of galactic chemical evolution suggest that the metallicity at the center of our galaxy , where the density of matter is high , can reach up to 3 to 5 times the solar metallicity ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 , simpson et al .",

    "the properties of the wr star models at metallicities between 0.001 and 0.04 have already been presented in maeder & meynet ( 1994 ) . here",
    "we shall focus our discussion on the expected characteristics of the wr stars in very metal - rich environments , i.e. at @xmath86 .    the minimum initial mass for a single star to become a wr star is a decreasing function of metallicity .",
    "it goes from at @xmath5 to at @xmath57 ( see table 1 in maeder & meynet 1994 , @xmath87 case ) , and to approximately at @xmath4 .      at @xmath4 , stars more massive than about 60 @xmath89 literally evaporate during the main sequence phase .",
    "they loose so much mass that they never reach the he - burning phase , and will likely end their nuclear life as helium white dwarfs . let us remark here that helium white dwarf stars are generally thought to be the end point evolution of very low mass stars typically with initial masses between 0.08 and 0.5 @xmath89 .",
    "their existence in our present universe is thus doubtful ( unless created through binary mass transfer ) , since the ms lifetimes of these very low mass stars are greater than the present age of the universe .",
    "in contrast , the above scenario ( already addressed by maeder & lequeux 1982 ; see also paper v ) , in which massive evaporating stars could end their stellar life as helium white dwarfs , allows the formation of such objects in young star forming regions at very high metallicities .",
    "stars more massive than about 50 @xmath89 never enter the wc phase at @xmath4 .",
    "due to very high mass loss rates acting already during the ms , the h - convective core rapidly decreases in mass , leaving behind a great portion of the star with cno - enriched material . as a consequence , the star goes through a very long wn phase .",
    "moreover , these stars enter the core he - burning phase , if they do enter this phase at all , with very low masses .",
    "this implies in particular so small mass loss rates , according to the @xmath90 relation proposed by langer ( 1989 ) , that their helium burning core never uncovers , preventing the star to become a wc wolf - rayet star .",
    "the number ratio of wr to o type stars expected in a constant star formation rate region at @xmath4 is estimated from these models to be around 0.45 . to compute this value ,",
    "only the single star evolutionary channel was considered , we chose a salpeter initial mass function ( i.e. with a slope equal to 1.35 ) , and the upper mass limit was taken equal to 60 @xmath89 .",
    "from the above result , one expects to find at @xmath4 about 1 wr star per each 2 o - type stars detected ! this is a very large proportion compared to regions with solar and sub - solar metallicity ( in the solar neighborhood , the observed number ratio wr / o is 0.1 ) .",
    "this high proportion results mainly from the very high mass losses experienced by these metal - rich stars , which , as seen above , decrease the minimum initial mass for wr star formation , make the star enter the wr phase at an earlier stage of its evolution , and increase the core helium burning lifetime .",
    "moreover , the duration of the o - type phase of metal - rich stars is considerably reduced as compared to that at lower metallicities .",
    "for instance when z increases from 0.04 to 0.1 , the lifetime of the o - type phase decreases by about a factor 2 .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the shorter duration of the h - burning phase at @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : th ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the final evolution of massive stars and estimate the relative fraction of supernovae with wr progenitors using some simplifying assumptions ( see also meynet et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "there is at present some uncertainties concerning the fate of wr stars , and to which type of supernovae they can give birth .",
    "as a first approximation , we make the hypothesis that all wr stars do lead to supernovae events ( see a discussion in maeder & lequeux 1982 ) .",
    "moreover , since the h - rich envelope is ejected through the wind during the wnl phase , we further assume that wne and wc stars result in supernovae of type i ( whether ib , ic , or another yet unknown subclassification ) . with these assumptions , and not considering type ia supernovae which have low - mass progenitors",
    ", one expects that metal - rich regions be characterized by a higher fraction of type i(b / c ) supernovae relative to the total number of supernovae ( maeder 1992 ) . as a numerical example , using the same imf as in sect .",
    "[ sect : wr - o ] and making the hypothesis of constant star formation rate , one obtains that , at @xmath4 , the fraction of supernovae with wne - wc progenitors amounts to 32% of the total number of supernovae having massive star progenitors . in other words ,",
    "1 supernova event out of 3 should be of type i(b / c ) in very metal - rich regions .",
    "for comparison , this proportion decreases to 1 wr explosion per @xmath91 supernovae at solar metallicity .",
    "this paper analyzes some properties of stellar models as a function of the metallicity , with particular attention to those at very high metallicities ( above twice or three times solar ) .",
    "the stellar properties as a function of @xmath0 are shown to result from the action of four ingredients : the mean molecular weight , an increase of which leads to more luminous and hotter stars ( the @xmath28-effect ) ; the opacity , an increase of which leads to less luminous and cooler stars ( the @xmath29-effect ) ; the nuclear energy production ( but to a lesser extent ) , an increase of which leads to less luminous and cooler stars with lower @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( the @xmath30-effect ; and mass loss , which acts indirectly on the stellar structure by reducing the stellar mass ( dramatically in the most massive metal - rich stars ) .",
    "the @xmath29-effect plays the main role at @xmath68 , while the @xmath28-effect becomes preponderant at @xmath26 . in the later case ,",
    "the @xmath18 law is important .",
    "based on these considerations and on the geneva s grids of stellar models , it is shown in particular that very metal - rich stars exhibit properties which can not be extrapolated from model characteristics at lower metallicities .",
    "in particular ,    - very metal - rich stars ( such as at @xmath4 ) are more luminous and hotter than those at @xmath92 .",
    "this property contrasts with the usually known trend at lower metallicities ( whereby @xmath34 and @xmath33 decrease with increasing @xmath0 due to the @xmath29-effect ) ;    - very metal - rich stars have much lower ms lifetimes than those at @xmath92 .",
    "for example the ms lifetime at @xmath4 is 2.5 times shorter than that at solar metallicity , independent of their initial mass ( at least up to ) ;    - stellar population synthesis in metal - rich environments is significantly affected by the increased mass loss rates at high @xmath0 . in particular , a ) massive stars with @xmath4 enter the wnl wolf - rayet phase very early during their evolution , and those more massive than about probably never enter the wc phase ; b ) the most massive ( @xmath93 at @xmath4 ) high - metallicity stars loose the majority of their mass during their ms phase , and probably end their life as he white dwarfs ; and c ) the number of wr stars over o - type stars increases with metallicity , and metal - rich regions are expected to be characterized by a high fraction of type i ( b / c / other ? ) supernovae relative to the total number of supernovae having massive star progenitors ( up to 1 out of 3 core collapse supernovae events at @xmath4 ) .",
