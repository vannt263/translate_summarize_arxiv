    "the fundamental theory of the strong interaction is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "qcd has a local @xmath3 gauge symmetry which determines the interaction between matter constituents , the quarks , and gauge fields , the gluons . for massless quarks ,",
    "the quark sector of the qcd lagrangian also has a global @xmath0 chiral symmetry , where @xmath4 is the number of quark flavors .",
    "the @xmath5 anomaly induced by instantons @xcite breaks this symmetry explicitly to @xmath6 , where vector and axial vector symmetries are introduced via @xmath7 .",
    "the discrete @xmath8 symmetry plays no role for the dynamics and will be omitted in the following .",
    "nonzero , degenerate quark masses explicitly break @xmath9 , such that the remaining symmetry is @xmath10 .",
    "non - degenerate quark masses further break this symmetry to @xmath11 , corresponding to baryon number conservation .    at low momenta @xmath12 , where @xmath13 mev is the qcd scale parameter , quarks and gluons are confined inside hadrons .",
    "therefore , on a typical hadronic length scale @xmath14 fm , the @xmath3 gauge symmetry of qcd is ( at best ) of minor importance , and the interactions between hadrons are predominantly determined by the global @xmath0 chiral symmetry of qcd . in the qcd vacuum , the axial @xmath15 part of the latter symmetry is spontaneously broken by a non - vanishing expectation value of the quark condensate @xmath16 @xcite . according to goldstone s theorem",
    ", this would lead to @xmath17 goldstone bosons .",
    "however , since the explicit symmetry breaking induced by the @xmath5 anomaly reduces the axial symmetry to @xmath9 , spontaneous symmetry breaking of the latter gives rise to only @xmath18 goldstone bosons .",
    "these goldstone bosons acquire a mass due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking by nonzero quark masses .    at temperatures of the order of @xmath19 ,",
    "the thermal excitation energy is large enough to restore the @xmath9 symmetry of qcd .",
    "if instantons are sufficiently screened @xcite , this could additionally lead to a restoration of the explicitly broken @xmath5 . for vanishing quark masses ,",
    "the high- and the low - temperature phases of qcd have different symmetries , and therefore must be separated by a phase transition .",
    "the order of this chiral phase transition is determined by the global symmetry of the qcd lagrangian ; for @xmath0 , the transition is of first order if @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , the transition can be of second order if @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "if the quark masses are nonzero , the second - order phase transition becomes cross - over .",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict the chiral phase transition to happen at a temperature @xmath23 mev @xcite for zero quark chemical potential @xmath24 .",
    "the phase transition temperature is expected to decrease when @xmath24 increases and vanishes at some value @xmath25 corresponding to quark number densities of the order of a few times nuclear matter density .",
    "therefore , the chiral transition of qcd is the only phase transition in a theory of one of the fundamental forces of nature which can be studied under laboratory conditions : heavy - ion collision experiments performed at the accelerator facilities cern - sps , bnl - rhic and , in the near future , cern - lhc and gsi - fair create matter which is sufficiently hot and/or dense , such that chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "indeed , the primary goal of these experiments is to find evidence for the restoration of chiral symmetry by the creation of the so - called quark - gluon plasma , i.e. , the phase of qcd where quarks and gluons are liberated from confinement .    when chiral symmetry is restored , the masses of hadrons with the same quantum numbers except for parity and g - parity , so - called chiral partners , become degenerate .",
    "chiral partners are , for instance , the sigma and the pion in the ( pseudo-)scalar sector , or the @xmath2 and the @xmath26 in the ( axial ) vector sector .",
    "a promising signal for chiral symmetry restoration in heavy - ion collisions is therefore to study changes of the spectral properties of hadrons in the hot and dense environment @xcite .",
    "one of the prime candidates is the @xmath2 meson .",
    "the @xmath2 meson decays sufficiently fast ( and with  for experimental purposes  sufficiently large branching ratio ) into a pair of dileptons which , due to their small ( since electromagnetic ) cross section , are able to carry information from the hot and dense stages of a heavy - ion collision to the detector .",
    "the ceres and na60 experiments at the cern - sps have found convincing evidence for a modification of the @xmath2 meson spectral function in pb+pb and in+in collisions , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is important to clarify whether the modification of the @xmath2 meson spectral function observed by the cern - sps experiments is in any way related to chiral symmetry restoration or is merely due to many - body interactions in the hot and dense medium .",
    "this question can be decided by calculating the dilepton production rate from qcd and then using this rate in a dynamical model for heavy - ion collisions in order to compute the dilepton spectrum .",
    "the low - invariant mass region of the dilepton spectrum is dominated by the decay of hadronic states .",
    "therefore , for the calculation of the dilepton rate it is more convenient to apply a low - energy effective theory for qcd , featuring hadronic states as elementary degrees of freedom and respecting the chiral symmetries of qcd , rather than using qcd itself . since we are interested in the restoration of chiral symmetry at nonzero temperature , the low - energy effective theory of choice is a linear sigma model which treats hadrons and their chiral partners on the same footing .",
    "linear sigma models have been used for quite some time in order to study chiral symmetry restoration in hot and dense strongly interacting matter .",
    "for instance , pisarski and wilczek have applied renormalization group arguments to a @xmath27 symmetric linear sigma model with scalar degrees of freedom and have drawn important qualitative conclusions regarding the order of the chiral phase transition for different numbers of quark flavors @xcite .",
    "the calculation of hadronic properties at nonzero temperature ( and density ) faces serious technical difficulties .",
    "for instance , for the following reasons it is impossible to apply standard perturbation theory .",
    "first , it turns out that the coupling constants of effective low - energy models of qcd are of the order of one , rendering a perturbative series in the coupling constant unreliable .",
    "second , nonzero temperature ( or density ) introduces an additional scale which invalidates the usual power counting in terms of the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "a consistent calculation to a given order in the coupling constant then may require a resummation of whole classes of diagrams @xcite .    a convenient technique to perform such a resummation and",
    "thus arrive at a particular many - body approximation scheme is the so - called two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) or cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) formalism @xcite , which is a relativistic generalisation of the @xmath28 functional formalism @xcite .",
    "the 2pi formalism extends the concept of the generating functional @xmath29 $ ] for one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green s functions to that of one for 2pi green s functions @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the expectation values of the one- and two - point functions .",
    "the central quantity in this formalism is the sum of all 2pi vacuum diagrams , @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "any many - body approximation scheme can be derived as a particular truncation of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "an advantage of the 2pi formalism is that it avoids double counting and fulfills detailed balance relations and thus is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "another advantage is that the noether currents are conserved for an arbitrary truncation of @xmath34 as long as the one- and two - point functions transform as rank-1 and -2 tensors .",
    "a disadvantage is that ward - takahashi identities for higher - order vertex functions are no longer fulfilled @xcite . as a consequence , goldstone s theorem",
    "is violated @xcite .",
    "another consequence is that sum rules of the weinberg type at zero and nonzero temperature @xcite are not necessarily fulfilled .",
    "a strategy to restore goldstone s theorem is to perform a so - called `` external '' resummation of random - phase - approximation diagrams with internal lines given by the full propagators of the underlying approximation in the 2pi formalism @xcite . in this work , however , this problem is less severe since we shall only focus on the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking by ( small ) non - vanishing quark masses .",
    "effective theories with chiral @xmath35 and @xmath36 symmetry have already been studied within the 2pi formalism in the so - called double - bubble approximation which gives rise to hartree - fock - type self - energies for the individual particles @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 model has also been studied within the 2pi formalism beyond the double - bubble approximation including sunset - type diagrams @xcite .",
    "the chiral models in these works , however , only include scalar and pseudoscalar particles . here",
    ", we extend these investigations to vector and axial vector mesons .    our ultimate goal is a calculation of the dilepton rate for given temperature ( and density ) . in this work ,",
    "we perform the first step in this direction studying chiral symmetry restoration in the mesonic mass spectrum at nonzero temperature .",
    "we apply the so - called gauged linear sigma model as outlined in ref .",
    "this model has been used by pisarski @xcite who varied the tree - level mass parameters in order to derive qualitative statements about the behavior of meson masses as a function of temperature . here",
    ", we extend these studies to a full - fledged self - consistent many - body calculation of meson masses at nonzero temperature using the 2pi formalism in double - bubble approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the following section is dedicated to a discussion of the gauged linear sigma model with @xmath0 chiral symmetry , with @xmath4 being the number of quark flavors . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we consider the case @xmath1 in more detail and rewrite the lagrangian explicitly in terms of scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial vector degrees of freedom .",
