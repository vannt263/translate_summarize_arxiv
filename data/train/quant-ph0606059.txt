    "in a recent paper fletcher , shor and win @xcite analyze error correction schemes obtained by ab initio optimization , rather than the adaptation of classical coding techniques .",
    "the basic idea @xcite is that both encoding @xmath0 and recovery ( or decoding ) @xmath1 can be arbitrary channels , and that for a given number @xmath2 of invocations of a noisy discrete memoryless channel the objective is to bring the channel @xmath3 as close to the identity as possible .",
    "if the so - called channel fidelity used as a figure of merit ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) the optimization is clearly a semidefinite problem , by virtue of jamiolkowski - choi duality .    in @xcite",
    "we presented an alternative algorithm for this semidefinite problem , and used it to generate optimal codes for various noisy channels , by alternatingly optimizing the encoding channel and the recovery channel . in @xcite",
    "only the recovery is optimized , which already gives a marked improvement some over previously known codes , specifically for the case of the four - bit correction of the amplitude damping channel @xcite . the possibility of further improvements by optimizing",
    "also the encoding is noted in the discussion ( citing also @xcite ) .",
    "it so turns out that the required computation ( even for the same test case ) was already done in the autumn of 2003 in a collaboration between the first two authors and the third author of this note , with the aim of checking the power - iteration method of @xcite against the better established semidefinite method .",
    "since these results directly support the perspective forwarded in @xcite , we felt it appropriate to make them immediately available .",
    "for the theoretical background we refer to either @xcite or @xcite . in both papers",
    "similar ideas and notations are used , so they should be readily accessible from each other .",
    "the _ amplitude damping channel _ is the qubit channel @xmath4 with kraus operators @xmath5 these channels form a semigroup ( @xmath6 , which contracts to the first `` unexcited '' basis state .",
    "the channel fidelity of a noisy channel @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a maximally entangled vector .",
    "note that this requires input and output of the channel to be systems with the same hilbert space , which is adapted to comparing the channel with the identity , which is the unique channel with @xmath10 .",
    "this is also closely related @xcite to the average fidelity for pure input states ( with the average taken according to the unitarily invariant measure ) .",
    "the main virtue of choosing this fidelity as a figure characterizing the deviation from the identity is that it is linear in @xmath7 .",
    "such a linear criterion is possible only because the ideal channel is on the boundary of the set of channels .",
    "error correction results for the amplitude damping channel ( four copies ) using three methods : ( a ) no coding , ( b ) optimized decoding by fletcher et al .",
    "@xcite ( with encoding by leung et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ( c ) our iterative optimization of both , encoding and decoding @xcite.,width=264 ]    the curve @xmath11 is the dotted line in fig .  1 .",
    "the other lines represent @xmath12 for various choices of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the dashed line uses the encoding @xmath13 by leung et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath15 with an optimized decoding @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in fact , we computed this line by our routines , and it coincides to within pixel resolution with the graph in @xcite .",
    "the solid line is the result of the iteration @xcite , in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 are alternatingly optimized , keeping the other operation fixed .",
    "this iteration has a strict improvement over the leung code for @xmath16 .",
    "the methods in @xcite and @xcite have the following characteristic features :    * for a known channel these methods yield excellent results , without using any special properties of the channel like symmetry etc .. * the optimization of either encoding or decoding is a semidefinite problem for which the solution is a certified global optimum .",
    "the process of alternatingly optimizing these therefore improves the objective in every step , and hence converges to a local optimum . however , there is no guarantee for having found the global optimum . *",
    "the methods suffer from the familiar explosion of difficulty as the system size is increased .",
    "correction schemes like the five qubit code can still be handled on a pc , but a nine qubit code would involve optimization over @xmath17-matrices , which is set up by multiplying and contracting some matrices in @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "this may be possible on large machines , but it is clear that these methods are useless for asymptotic questions . * the iteration method replacing the semidefinite package in @xcite has a slight advantage here , because it works with a fixed number of kraus operators .",
    "so for the encoding one can put in by hand an isometric encoding , which , as our study shows , is often optimal .",
    "this cuts down on dimensions , at least for the optimization of encodings . * for asymptotic coding theory one",
    "still needs codes , which can be described also for very large dimensions , be it by explicit parameterization or by a characterization of typical instances of random codes .",
    "it is here that methods transferred from classical coding theory will continue to be useful .",
