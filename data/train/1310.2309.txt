    "in the modern paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation and evolution , formation of massive binary black holes ( bbhs ) is a natural consequence of mergers of galaxies with central massive black holes ( bhs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "study of the bbh orbital evolution and possible observational signals of existing or existed bbhs is one of the important steps to understand the formation and evolution of massive bhs , to answer the possibility of detection of gravitational wave radiation due to the bbh merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and to probe the hierarchical structure formation model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "orbital evolution of bbhs in merged galaxy remnants has been investigated in various aspects ( such as evolution timescales , evolution of semi - major axes , eccentricities , and orbital orientations ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we study the orbital orientation evolution of bbhs in purely stellar systems and investigate how the evolution is related to the bbh host galaxy properties such as triaxiality and/or rotation .",
    "the orbital orientation is one of the most basic physical properties of a bbh .",
    "it can influence the spin magnitude and direction of the merged bh ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the spin direction is believed to determine the direction of a jet launched from the bh inner accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the bbh orbital orientation can also influence the gravitational wave radiation from the bbh merger , the recoiling velocity of the merged bh arose from the asymmetry of the gravitational wave radiation , and possibly the strength of any electromagnetic signature of the merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after a galaxy merger , the orbit of a bbh decays in the merged galaxy remnant . in a gas - poor environment",
    ", the orbital evolution of a bbh can be divided into several stages , according to the mechanisms that act on the different separation scales to drain its orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "initially , each bh ( with mass denoted by @xmath0 or @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) sink independently towards the centre of the common gravitational potential under the action of dynamical friction , at separation scales ranging from several ten kpc to @xmath3 or 1 pc . as they migrate inward and",
    "form a bound bbh with orbital semimajor axis ar_inf 10 pc ( ) ( ) ^-2 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the merged galaxy core , it continues to lose energy and angular momentum through dynamical friction .",
    "however , the influence of dynamical friction on the bbh orbit becomes less efficient as its orbital period decreases and its orbital velocity increases . after the bbh becomes hard at @xcite a ~a_h 2.8 ( ) ( ) ^-2   pc , [ eq : ah ] it loses energy mainly through three - body interactions with low - angular momentum stars passing by its vicinity .",
    "finally , after the bbh orbit decays to some point ( @xmath6 pc ) , gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative force ( i.e. , gravitational radiation stage ) to make the bbh lose energy .",
    "the bbh at the different stages has different evolution timescales .",
    "the slowest evolution stage normally starts at @xmath7 and ends at the gravitational radiation stage , and the evolution timescale at the bottleneck depends on how many and how fast low - angular momentum stars are available to interact with the bbh .",
    "the non - spherical gravitational potential of galaxies ( e.g. , highly flattened or triaxial ) has been shown to be effective in having stars precessing from high - angular momentum orbits onto low - angular momentum ones so that the bottleneck timescales can be lower than the hubble time ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "a bbh is also more likely to have merged in low - velocity dispersion ` power - law ' galaxies @xcite .    at the bbh evolution bottleneck",
    ", each interaction of the bbh with a star passing by its vicinity may cause an exchange of the energy and the angular momentum , and lead to a slight change of the bbh orbital orientation .",
    "the slight orientation change of each interaction , denoted by @xmath8 , may accumulate , as the number of the stars passing by ( denoted by @xmath9 ) increases .",
    "in spherical and isotropic systems , the orbital orientation of a bbh evolves like a brownian motion with the accumulated orientation angle change @xmath10 @xcite . if the stellar system is rotating and the galactic core has a non - zero total angular momentum , @xcite find that the orbital orientation of a bbh evolves toward the direction of the total angular momentum of the stars .",
    "observations reveal that realistic galactic spheroids are likely to be triaxial ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) also show that the stellar remnant of galaxy mergers is triaxial and rotating . in this paper , we show that the non - spherical gravitational potential of a stellar system may affect the kinematic distribution of the stars passing by the vicinity of the bbh .",
    "we investigate the orientation evolution of hard bbhs in gas - poor non - spherical stellar systems including rotating ones , and show how their evolution is affected by the kinematic distributions of the stars passing by .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our model and method in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we present the simulated orbital orientation evolution of hard bbhs in different stellar systems ( spherical , axisymmetric , triaxial , rotating ) in section  [ sec : results ] . as a check for the method ,",
    "we apply it first to spherical systems in section  [ subsec : spherical ] and find that the results are consistent with the analytical result and previous work well .",
    "then we apply the method to non - spherical galaxies .",
    "we present the kinematic distribution of the stars passing by the vicinity of the bbh in section  [ subsec : non - spherical ] . by generating a sample of bbhs with various initial orbital orientations",
    ", we illustrate the tendency of the bbh orientation evolution and distributions after the bbhs interact with a large number of the stars in sections  [ subsec : bbhevol ] and [ subsec : bbhdistr ] .",
    "the results obtained for non - spherical galaxies are presented along with the comparison with those obtained for spherical cases . discussion is given in section  [ subsec : discussion ] , and a summary of the conclusion is in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we first present the basic physical equations on the dynamical evolution of the system to be studied , and then describe the method to solve the equations . to expedite the calculations",
    ", we divide the evolution of the system into two stages and present them in detail in sections  [ subsec : precess ] and [ subsec : scattering ] , respectively .",
    "consider that a massive hard bbh with masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 is located in the centre of a gas - poor galaxy .",
    "we denote the galaxy gravitational potential field contributed by stars at position @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "the bbh interacts with stars passing by its vicinity through three - body gravitational interactions , which can be described through the following equations of motion : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the position vectors of the two bhs and the star , respectively , [ eq : potential ] ( r_*)=- - + _ g(r _ * ) , and the newtonian mechanics is used .",
    "note that the galactic potential field @xmath12 is included in the motion of the star , as the stars interacting with the hard bbh may come from a large distance in the galaxy and the stellar motion is affected by the galactic potential along the long ways to / from the hard bbh .",
    "the centre of the galactic potential , i.e. , the minimum point of the potential , is always put at rest at the origin of the coordinate system in the calculation .",
    "the centre of the mass of the bbh is initially put at the centre of the galactic potential ; and the translational brownian motion of the bbh is ignored . ) ; and moreover , the bbhs in high - velocity dispersion ` core ' galaxies reach the gravitational radiation stages before their semimajor axis shrink to the wandering amplitudes of their centres of mass .",
    "thus the wandering of the bbh should not change the effects of the stellar kinematic distribution qualitatively on the bbh orbital orientation qualitatively discussed in our study .",
    "especially , our study shows that the bbh orbital orientation in triaxial systems can evolve as a brownian motion , instead of some alignment along the galactic rotating axis , and the result is not affected by the bbh wandering through a kinematically isotropic background induced by the triaxiality of the system ( see section  [ sec : results ] below ) . ]    after each interaction of the bbh with a star , the bbh generally receives an energy loss and angular momentum change , which can be obtained by following their motion and numerically solving the differential equations ( [ eq : bh1_orbit])([eq : potential ] ) together . the total change of the bbh is an accumulative effect of the interactions .",
    "however , the numerical calculation to follow the stellar motion may be time - consuming , as the moving time of a star in the galaxy may be much longer than the orbital period of the bbh and the rotational motion of the bbh described in equations ( [ eq : bh1_orbit ] ) and ( [ eq : bh2_orbit ] ) limits the time steps used in the calculation . noting that the galactic potential @xmath17 dominates the stellar motion when the stars are significantly far away from the bbh , the bbh can be simplified as one object with mass @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the combined potential in equation ( [ eq : potential ] ) can be simplified as ( r_*)=- + _ g(r _ * ) , r_*=|r_*| , [ eq : potentialsimple ] which is independent of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "to expedite the calculations , we divide the stellar motion and our calculations into the following two stages :    * stellar precessing stage : the stellar orbits precess in the combined gravitational potential field described by equations ( [ eq : star_orbit ] ) and ( [ eq : potentialsimple ] ) , and we numerically trace the stellar orbits obtain the kinematic distributions of the stars that can come to a distance @xmath19 to the galactic centre ; * three - body scattering stage : we calculate the three - body scattering processes of the bbh with the stars that can come to its vicinity by using equations ( [ eq : bh1_orbit])([eq : potential ] ) .",
    "the kinematic distribution of the stars coming to the bbh vicinity obtained in the above stellar precessing stage is used as the initial condition of the three - body interactions .",
    "the galactic potential is spherical if it can be described in the form of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and triaxial if it can be described in the form of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "in our model , we use the following logarithmic potential as an example for triaxial galaxies : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the core radius .",
    "the @xmath5 can be set through the tight empirical correlation between the bh mass and the galactic velocity dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in this paper we adopted the following relation : @xmath26 although a self - consistent model of a realistic stellar distribution around a massive bh is not used in this paper , the above logarithmic potential used should be sufficient to display the effects of the triaxiality qualitatively .      we describe the dynamics of a star in the phase space of its specific energy and specific angular momentum @xmath27 . in spherical potentials , the angular momenta of stars are conserved , and the stars that can come to the vicinity of the bbh ( @xmath28 from the centre ) have the orbital angular momenta @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and the corresponding region in the phase space is called the `` loss cone '' . in axisymmetric and triaxial",
    "galaxies , there exist centrophilic orbits such as box orbits , which pass arbitrarily close to the centre and have low angular momentum , as well as centrophobic orbits such as loop orbits , which avoid centre and have high angular momentum . here , we introduce @xmath31 to mark the transition from centrophilic ( @xmath32 ) to centrophobic ( @xmath33 ) orbits .",
    "stars on centrophilic orbits with @xmath34 can process into the loss cone . in non - spherical galaxies ,",
    "the number of stars available to interact with the bbh can be large , and it has been shown that the bbh bottleneck evolution timescale can be decreased significantly ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we use monte - carlo simulations to obtain the characteristic angular momentum @xmath31 and the kinematic distribution of the stars that can come to the vicinity of the bbh . in our simulations , the initial kinematic settings for the stars are set as follows .",
    "* given the specific energy @xmath35 of a star , its specific angular momentum @xmath36 is randomly generated so that @xmath37 is uniformly distributed within the range @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the specific angular momentum of a circular orbit at energy @xmath35 ( cf . , eq .",

    "the relative error of the initial @xmath40 and @xmath41 caused by approximating the potential as spherical is negligible for the purpose of this paper , as the orbital energy difference for the same initial @xmath40 and @xmath41 between the spherical and the triaxial / axisymmetric systems is at the most the galactic potential difference between the positions @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the initial direction of the orbital angular momentum of the star is parameterized by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the angle between the angular momentum and the @xmath47-axis and @xmath48 is the azimuthal angle of the angular momentum direction in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "the directions are generated isotropically and randomly .",
    "the argument of its apocentre @xmath50 is generated randomly within @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "thus , the position and velocity vectors of stars can be derived and serve as the initial conditions for equation ( [ eq : star_orbit ] ) .",
    "we use the above initial settings and equations ( [ eq : star_orbit ] ) and ( [ eq : potentialsimple ] ) to trace the motion of the stars . the calculation for each star",
    "is terminated once its @xmath52 ( centrophilic orbits ) or its traveling time is longer than @xmath53 ( where eq .",
    "[ eq : msigma ] is used ) .",
    "we select those stars for which the calculation is terminated due to @xmath52 , and obtain their kinematic distributions when they pass through @xmath54 at its last orbit of the calculation .",
    "the kinematic distributions of these stars are used as the initial conditions in the calculation for the three - body scattering stage of the stars interacting with the bbh .",

    "the unit orbital angular momentum of the bbh is denoted by @xmath58 , and the orientation direction can also be parameterized by angles @xmath59 , similarly as the angles @xmath60 described above for the stellar angular momentum .",
    "we randomly select a star from the kinematic distribution obtained in the stellar precessing stage and use equations ( [ eq : bh1_orbit])([eq : star_orbit ] ) to trace its three - body scattering processes with the bbh .",
    "the calculation is terminated when the distance of the star has @xmath61 or its traveling time in the three - body scattering stage is longer than @xmath62 , and the bbh orbital orientation @xmath63 is recorded and used as the initial condition in the scattering process with next star .",
    "the calculation is reiterated by scattering with @xmath9 number of stars .",
    "the number of the scattered stars is related to the bbh orbital decay by the following equation ( see eq.12 in @xcite ) : n0.32 ( ) .",
    "[ eq : nscatter ] for simplicity and saving the calculation time , the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the bbh @xmath64 is fixed during the reiterations ; and the translational brownian motion of the bbh induced after the scattering process with each star is ignored , with the center of mass of the bbh being reset to the centre of the galactic potential at the beginning of the scattering with the next star .",
    "we also assume that the stars have an identical stellar mass @xmath65(=@xmath66 ) .",

    "the total energy of the bbh and the star is conserved ; and to ensure the accuracy of numerical calculations , the change in their total energy due to numerical errors must be much smaller than the change of the bbh energy due to each interaction with a star passing by , so that the change of the bbh energy obtained from the calculations is not caused by numerical errors . the absolute relative error of the total energy achieved in our calculations is lower than @xmath68 for each three - body encounter , which is accurate enough , as the relative change in the bbh energy due to each interaction with a passing - by star is roughly order of @xmath69 .",
    "we have also checked that our results are not affected much even by decreasing the accuracy by one order of magnitude . as to be mentioned in section  [ sec : results ] , the validity of our calculation methods is further supported by figure  [ fig : deltathetaspherical ] below .",

    "figure  [ fig : afixing ] shows that the orientation changes at different @xmath142 are also mild in axisymmetric systems ( see crosses in the figure ) ; and the changes result mainly from different precession speeds in @xmath119 , which do not affect the bbh orientation distribution ( e.g. , as shown in  [ fig : bbhdis]c ) . regarding the bbh orientation evolution , the cases illustrated in figure  [ fig : afixing ] are the extreme ones among the cases shown in figures  [ fig : bbhevolspherical][fig : bbhevolnonspherical ] , which suggests that our main conclusions should not be affected by the fixing of @xmath142 . regarding the bbh eccentricity evolution , it is plausible to ignore it in an isotropic stellar system if the initial bbh eccentricity is low , as @xcite shows that the change of the bbh eccentricity in such a case is not significant ( see also the simulation results of different initial settings in @xcite ) . in kinematically anisotropic spherical systems with stars mostly counter - rotating with the bbh orbit ,",
    "some simulations show that the bbh eccentricity could increase significantly @xcite ; and we expect that the significant increase of the bbh eccentricity can be decreased or erased if the systems are triaxial , by applying the same reason for the alignment - erasing effect obtained in this paper .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : introduction ] , before a bbh becomes bound and hard , the two bhs sink into the galactic centre through dynamical friction , and their orbital orientation is likely to be changed in a non - spherical galaxy during the dynamical friction stage . we construct a simple model to simulate the inspiraling of a relatively small bh from a large scale ( e.g. , @xmath143 ) into the galactic centre during the dynamical friction stage , as modeled in section 4 in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the orbital orientations of the small bhs is isotropic initially at the large scale , and we find that in triaxial galaxies ( e.g. , with triaxiality parameters as those in fig .

    "[ fig : deltathetaspherical ] . as seen from this figure , the rms of the orientation change of hard bbhs is not affected much by different @xmath142 .",

    ", we estimate the potential contribution from the post - newtonian terms by orders of magnitude as follows .",
    "consider a star that starts with a low velocity passes by the bbh at a distance @xmath148 .",
    "the energy and the angular momentum change of the star comes mainly from the interaction with the smaller bh if @xmath149 .",
    "first , with only using the newtonian mechanics , the specific interaction force on the star @xmath150 acts for a time @xmath151 to produce a velocity change @xmath152 and thus result in an orientation change of the bbh @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the orbital angular momentum of the bbh . then ,",
    "if considering the contribution from the post - newtonian terms , the relative change in @xmath156 is @xmath157 $ ] , where @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 are the changes in @xmath41 , @xmath161 , and @xmath155 due to the post - newtonian terms , respectively . to approximate the contribution from the post - newtonian terms , we replace the gravitational potential @xmath162 of a particle with mass @xmath163 by @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 is the speed of light @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 ; and the absolute value of the relative change in @xmath170 is @xmath171 , where the definition of @xmath73 in equation ( [ eq : ah ] ) is used .",
    "so the effect of the post - newtonian terms is generally small enough to be negligible for the study of this paper .",
    "gas - poor mergers can occupy a significant fraction of galaxy mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , a significant fraction of galaxy mergers can also be gas - rich . in a merger with sufficient gas",
    ", it is expected that the orbital orientation of the bbh always evolve towards co - alignment with the angular momentum direction of its circumbinary disk . however , the role of the gas depends on the amount of gas available . on a timescale short",
    "compared with the mass growth timescale of the bbh , the bbh orientation may maintain the counter - alignment if the bbh is initially sufficiently retrograde with the disk @xcite ; and each bh may be surrounded by its own accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which does not necessarily co - align with the circumbinary disk .",
    "in this paper , we study the orbital orientation evolution of bbh systems , and mainly focus on their evolution in triaxial ( and axisymmetric ) systems . for spherical stellar systems ,",
    "we have reproduced the result that the orientation of a bbh undergoes random walks in kinematically isotropic systems . and in rotating spherical galaxies where the stars have a non - zero total angular momentum , the bbh orientation change is larger and its orbital direction reorients toward the direction of that total angular momentum . in triaxial systems , the initial angular momenta of the stars that can precess to the very vicinity of a bbh can be far larger than those of the stars initially in the loss cone .",
    "the directions of the angular momenta of the stars when they precess to the vicinity of a bbh can be anisotropic due to the torque induced by the triaxial potential , and the degree of the anisotropy depends on the stellar energy as well as the triaxiality or the flattening of the galactic gravitational potential . in axisymmetric galaxies ,",
    "the angular momenta of the stars are inclined to align to the axisymmetric axis of the system .",
    "if the anisotropy of the kinematic distributions of the interacting stars is significant , the orientation evolution of a bbh is different from random walks obtained in non - rotating spherical galaxies . in axisymmetric galaxies , the evolution of the bbh orientation includes the alignment towards the axisymmetric axis and the precession around the axisymmetric axis in a direction retrograde to the bbh orbit .",
    "we find that the triaxial potential has an _ alignment - erasing _ effect , if most of the stars that can come to the vicinity of the bbh have significantly high energy . in this case",
    ", the kinematic distribution of the stars when they come to the bbh vicinity is close to isotropic even if they are initially anisotropic ( e.g. , in a rotating system ) . due to the alignment - erasing effect",
    ", the alignment of the bbh orientations towards the rotation axis of a system can be decreased significantly in triaxial galaxies .",
    "if orbital orientation distributions of bbhs are isotropic when they become hard , their distributions may maintain isotropic after interacting with sufficiently numerous stars in significantly triaxial systems ; however , they can be anisotropic in axisymmetric systems , and the number of bbhs with angular momentum directions near the axisymmetric axis is enhanced .",
    "if a bbh with comparable mass components ( e.g. , formed in a major merger of two galaxies ) merges , the direction of the bbh orbital angular momentum is likely to dominate the spin direction of the merged bh remnant , and also dominate the jet direction if some gas sink to the vicinity of the merged bh and a jet is produced . if the galaxy is significantly triaxial , the alignment - erasing effect obtained in this paper would imply that there is no preferred orientation of host galaxies and radio jets , but a preferential alignment in relatively axisymmetric galaxies if the axisymmetric axis of the system does not change significantly with galactic radii .    regarding the tendency for the axis of the radio emission to align with an axis of the galaxy starlight",
    ", a dependence on the galaxy properties was possibly revealed in observations .",
    "such a tendency was found in weak radio - loud agns , but not among the radio - louder objects possibly hosted in triaxial elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this preliminary study mainly uses simple hybrid models for the galactic gravitational potential , stellar distribution , and rotation of the system to illustrate the related effects ; and the simplification of the model should not a concern for the purpose of this paper , although a more sophistical self - consistent model of these properties needs to be used in realistic galaxies .",
