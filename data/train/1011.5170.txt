    "one of the first results to emerge from high - precision radial velocity ( rv ) surveys seeking substellar companions was the existence of a brown dwarf ( bd ) desert : a paucity of close ( @xmath10au ) brown dwarf ( @xmath11 ) companions to solar - type stars , relative to more common stellar mass companions @xcite .",
    "indeed , since they induce reflex radial velocity semiamplitudes of many hundreds of meters per second , such brown dwarf companions have been within the detection capabilities of these surveys for over two decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) , yet to date only a few dozen are known ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , as instrumentation has subsequently improved , first jovian , and now terrestrial planetary companions in similar orbits have been found in relative abundance @xcite .",
    "the brown dwarf mass regime represents an apparent minimum in the mass distribution of close companions to solar - type stars .",
    "planetary companions are believed to form in circumstellar protoplanetary disks , whereas stellar companions are believed to form by concurrent collapse or fragmentation , so the brown dwarf desert is commonly interpreted as the gap between the largest mass objects that can be formed in disks , and the smallest mass clump that can collapse and/or fragment in the vicinity of a protostar .",
    "such a gap was by no means guaranteed to exist , and is perhaps surprising .",
    "for example , numerous isolated bds in star - forming regions have been found to possess protoplanetary disks , akin to the disks of young stars , suggesting that bds form much as stars do ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more generally , the mass function of isolated substellar objects in the field and clusters appears to be roughly flat in @xmath12 for masses down to at least @xmath13 @xcite , whereas it is not clear what sets the upper limit for objects formed in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as such , details of the demographics of companions in the brown dwarf desert , including the aridity of the desert , the shape of the high - mass tail of the planetary companion mass function and the low - mass tail of the stellar companion mass function , as well as how these properties change with semimajor axis and primary mass , encode a wealth of information about the poorly understood physics of star and planet formation .",
    "additional processes such as tidal evolution and disk - planet migration can also affect these properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , thus can be investigated via brown dwarf desert statistics .    unfortunately , despite its potential diagnostic power , and after more than twenty years of precision radial velocity surveys ,",
    "very little is known about the brown dwarf desert , precisely because brown dwarf companions are rare and so few such companions are known .",
    "the california & carnegie planet search finds an occurrence rate of 0.7% @xmath14 0.2% from their sample of @xmath15 target stars ( vogt et al .",
    "2002 , patel et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the mcdonald observatory planet search agrees , with a rate of 0.8% @xmath14 0.6% from a search sample of 250 stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that brown dwarfs might not be as rare at wide separations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite find a low rate of occurrence that is similar to that found for close separations .",
    "by extrapolating the mass functions of planets ( on the low mass side ) and stellar companions ( on the high mass side ) into the brown dwarf mass regime , @xcite find a mass of minimum occurrence ( the driest part of the brown dwarf desert ) at @xmath16 .",
    "they further suggest that the location of this minimum may scale with host star mass .",
    "for instance , the only known bd eclipsing binary is a `` desert dweller '' , consisting of a @xmath17 bd with a @xmath18 bd companion at a separation of @xmath19au @xcite .    to make further progress on understanding the properties of the brown dwarf desert ,",
    "a much larger sample of brown dwarf companions is needed .",
    "furthermore , this larger sample must be drawn from a relatively uniform survey with a well - defined and homogeneous sample of primary target stars , so that the demographic properties of these companions can be reliably inferred .",
    "given the occurrence rate of @xmath20 , a survey of @xmath21 stars is needed to detect of order 100 brown dwarf companions .",
    "such an extensive survey would require a prohibitive amount of observing time with traditional echelle - based precision rv instruments , which can only target one object at a time .",
    "furthermore , in many cases the rv precisions that can be achieved with these instruments are far better than are needed to detect brown dwarf companions , implying that this is not the most efficient application of these instruments .",
    "the multi - object apo radial velocity exoplanets large - area survey ( marvels ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a radial velocity survey of @xmath22 stars ( @xmath21 dwarfs and subgiants , plus @xmath15 giants ) with @xmath23 over time baselines of @xmath24 years , with a stated goal of @xmath25 m  s@xmath2 precision for the faintest stars .",
    "it operates as one of the bright - time survey components of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) iii , following on the legacy of the original sdss @xcite .",
    "marvels uses the innovative instrumental technique of a dispersed fixed - delay interferometer ( dfdi ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to simultaneously observe 60 objects at a time over a three degree field of view with a single instrument that is fiber fed from the sdss 2.5-m telescope @xcite at apache point observatory .",
    "the fibers are fed through an interferometer , and both interferometer output beams are sent through a spectrograph with a resolving power @xmath26 , producing fringing spectra over the wavelength range @xmath27 nm .",
    "radial velocity information is imprinted in the phases of the fringes perpendicular to the dispersion axis of the spectrum due to a fixed variation in the interferometer delay along this direction .    by virtue of the large number of target stars , as well as",
    "uniform selection criteria described below , marvels is well suited to probe for rare companions",
    ". marvels commenced operations with sdss - iii in sep .",
    "2008 , and as of the end of the first year s data collection in aug .",
    "2009 , had observed 780 stars with rv time series of more than 15 points . in this paper , we report the first marvels brown dwarf candidate , which we designate marvels-1b , detected in orbit around the star tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 ( tycho-2 star catalogue ; @xcite ) .",
    "the overall scope of marvels will be described in detail in future papers ; we present a brief outline here in order to provide the context for the field and target selection of the brown dwarf candidate .",
    "marvels has been designed with an rv precision goal of @xmath25 m  s@xmath2 in order to be able to discover a sample of @xmath28 new exoplanets , within a homogeneous parent sample of searched stars . by choosing a sample of target stars using a limited number of well - defined selection criteria , our sample suffers from minimal and well - understood biases , and",
    "can increase the size of the largest statistically homogeneous exoplanet sample by a factor of a few over that currently available .",
    "marvels will run for six years during sdss - iii bright time , in a series of three cycles of self - contained two - year surveys .",
    "each cycle will have a similar stellar target selection strategy , designed to give good survey coverage of fgk dwarfs and similar parent samples in each two - year cycle , although with different target fields . while in general this means only companions with up to @xmath24 year periods will be detected",
    ", the advantage of this strategy is that we need not wait the full six years to gather enough epochs per star to detect companions .",
    "also , this approach provides the opportunity to do major instrument upgrades at the end of each two - year cycle , without destroying the continuity of our rv measurements .    in order to collect enough photons to achieve @xmath25 m  s@xmath2 statistical rv precision",
    ", the stars we monitor must in general be brighter than @xmath29 , although the precision at a given magnitude depends somewhat on stellar parameters as well .",
    "for the 60 object multiplexing capability of the instrument during the first two years ( sep .",
    "2008sep . 2010 ) , we found most fields on the sky were sufficiently rich to fill all the object fibers , so half of our fields were selected to include a reference star of @xmath30 with a known rv signal ( stable or planet - hosting ) . by recovering the rv of the reference star , we can verify that the instrument is sufficiently stable to detect planetary companions . to ensure survey observability across all right ascensions ,",
    "the remaining fields were selected from areas with no reference stars . finally , we also selected some fields in the kepler survey footprint @xcite in order to have the potential to leverage the exquisite kepler photometry for any stars targeted by both surveys .    in each individual field",
    ", we used the intersection of the gsc2.3 @xcite and 2mass @xcite catalogs as our initial targets database , but because many of our fields are in the galactic plane and contaminated by giants , we conducted a preselection program to identify and reject giants from the sample prior to beginning rv monitoring .",
    "first , we performed a rough cut in magnitude and color , accepting only stars with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the faint magnitude limit rejects stars too faint for the survey , and the bright magnitude limit keeps the dynamic range small enough to avoid saturating the preselection observations .",
    "the color cut eliminates most hot stars from consideration , since we can not obtain sufficient rv precision to detect planetary companions on any star hotter than mid - f .",
    "second , we took spectral classification snapshots of the potential target stars using the sdss double spectrographs @xcite mounted on the sdss 2.5-m telescope , which have @xmath33 and cover the wavelength range @xmath34 nm .",
    "the preselection observations were processed using the sdss two - dimensional and one - dimensional spectroscopic pipelines @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and [ fe / h ] were derived using the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; @xcite ) .",
    "each spectrum was manually inspected to validate the parameters and to identify obvious binaries and emission line objects .",
    "the final 60 targets for each field were selected using the following method .",
    "first , we only consider stars with @xmath37k .",
    "we dedicated 6 of the targets for observing giants , and identified the brightest available dwarfs and subgiants from @xmath38 to fill the other 54 targets , where dwarfs and subgiants are defined as having @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , we selected the targets for observation by conducting a literature search to reject known variable stars , and used a reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram to classify them as giants or dwarfs . while we prefer to pick bright dwarfs , in practice this bright magnitude range is dominated by giants , and therefore the marvels giant sample is typically drawn from the bright magnitude bin . for @xmath31 , we ranked the stars by @xmath41 magnitude then picked the @xmath42 highest - ranked stars , although to avoid the survey being dominated by f - stars , we cap the number of stars with @xmath43k@xmath44k at no more than 24 out of 60 . in practice , this combination of criteria usually completes our 60 target selection without going fainter than @xmath45 .",
    "we do not impose selections based on the ages , activity levels , or metallicities of the stars .",
    "we have recently learned that the original version of the sspp code that we used for our target selection tends to overestimate @xmath36 , particularly for cool temperatures of @xmath46k .",
    "while we are working on improved methods to better discriminate between dwarfs and giants for targeting in future survey cycles , our target sample for the first two year survey cycle is likely to have more giants than we desired ; we estimate that up to 30% of targets in this sample could be giants due to the bias in the sspp results .",
    "note that we do not use the primary properties of tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 derived from the sspp in our subsequent analysis ; we rely on the more accurate determinations from the detailed analysis of high - resolution spectra as described in  [ sec : params ] .",
    "we only describe the sspp target selection method here because our marvels targets for years 1 and 2 ( including tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 ) have been selected based on the sspp results .",
    "tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 was part of the first two - year cycle of the sdss - iii marvels planet search program described above .",
    "this target was selected for radial velocity monitoring using the preselection methodology and instrumentation described in  [ sec : targetsel ] . in preselection observations for this star s field taken on sep .",
    "19 , 2008 , we obtained a series of five 7s and five 12s exposures of the target field , plus flat and arc lamp calibration exposures before and after this series . from preselection",
    ", the star appeared to be a late f - dwarf ( but see further details in  [ sec : params ] , which suggest it is starting to evolve into a subgiant ) suitable for inclusion in the marvels rv monitoring .",
    "our discovery radial velocity observations were taken using the sdss 2.5-m telescope at apache point observatory coupled to the marvels instrument , a 60 object fiber - fed dfdi @xcite .",
    "our two - output interferometer produces two fringing spectra ( `` beams '' ) per object , over wavelengths @xmath27 nm , with resolving power @xmath26 .",
    "the instrument is environmentally stabilized such that no iodine cell is needed in the stellar beam path , and instrument drift calibrations are simply taken before and after each stellar exposure .",
    "tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 was observed at 20 epochs from nov . 7 , 2008 to nov .",
    "11 , 2009 , as listed in table [ tab : obsjournal ] .",
    "exposures were 50 min .",
    ", yielding an average of 500 photons per ccd pixel on each @xmath47 pixel fringing spectrum .",
    "the rv signal on tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 was easily detected by eye in the rv curves from the first year of marvels .",
    "marvels rvs are differential measurements , based on the shift of the fringing spectrum relative to a template epoch .",
    "the rvs were derived from our 20 fringing spectrum observations using the preliminary version of our marvels dfdi pipeline , which is based on software from earlier dfdi prototype instruments ( e.g. , ge et al .",
    "we provide here a brief outline of the mechanics of the marvels - specific pipeline , but leave a full description to future techniques papers to be written on the overall performance of the marvels hardware and survey .    after performing standard multi - object spectroscopic preprocessing on each frame such as bias subtraction , flatfielding , and trimming out individual spectra",
    ", we proceed to straighten slanted spectral lines , straighten tilted traces , and divide out uneven slit illumination to produce clean images ready for analysis . to remove a faint pattern of background fringes caused by the interferometer",
    ", we apply a low - pass filter , which leaves the fringes on stellar lines visible .",
    "the pipeline seeks to measure the epoch - to - epoch shift in the two - dimensional fringing spectrum ( i.e. , a spectrum with sinusoidal modulations along the slit direction ) .",
    "the shift induced by a stellar radial velocity change comprises two orthogonal components .",
    "the first component , a small shift of the stellar absorption lines along the wavelength axis , is the shift that conventional doppler planet search instrumentation seeks to measure .",
    "the second component , a shift of the fringes on each absorption line along the spectrograph slit axis , is linearly proportional to the shift in the wavelength axis , but is amplified to a factor of a few times larger , and therefore provides most of the statistical leverage in our velocity measurement . at any given wavelength , the fringe shift is related to the radial velocity by a multiplicative factor derived from measurements of the interferometer in the lab before commissioning the instrument .",
    "we use @xmath48 minimization to determine the best - fit velocity shift for each epoch , relative to a template spectrum chosen to be the brightest one from the epochs that were observed .",
    "specifically , we determine the best - fit velocity shift that minimizes the shift of the spectrum along the wavelength and slit axes , relative to the template spectrum",
    ". we also account for the barycentric correction during the rv extraction routine , ensuring that the @xmath48 minimizer does not need to search as far in velocity space as it would if the earth s motion were not removed .",
    "wavelength and slit axis shifts between exposures induced by the instrument drift were measured from fringing spectra of a stable calibration source ( a tungsten lamp shining through a temperature - stabilized i@xmath49 gas cell ) taken before and after each stellar exposure , and the rv corrections due to these shifts are subtracted from each spectrum . because the epoch for the instrument drift rv zero - point differs from the epoch for the stellar rv zero - point , none of these differential rvs will have a value of exactly zero .",
    "because the interferometer splits the beam of each star , we record two separate spectra of each star on the ccd , and measure the rv from each of these spectra independently .",
    "we shall differentiate between these two simultaneously observed rv curves by using the labels `` beam1 '' and `` beam2 . ''",
    "although not all of the potential sources of systematic error would cause differences between the two beams rv curves , comparison of the two beams does provide a partial consistency check of the quality of the data and the reduction pipeline .      in order to check for intrinsic photometric variability indicating activity , as well as search for transits of the companion , we extracted the photometric time series data of tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 obtained by the kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt ) north transit survey @xcite .",
    "kelt consists of a @xmath50 mm lens imaging a @xmath51 field of view onto a @xmath52 ccd .",
    "kelt uses a red - pass filter with a 50% transmission point at @xmath53 nm , which , when folded with the ccd response , yields an effective bandpass similar to @xmath54 , but broader .",
    "the kelt data were processed as described in detail in @xcite . briefly , after flat - fielding , relative photometry was extracted using the isis image subtraction package @xcite , combined with point - spread fitting photometry using daophot @xcite .",
    "we reduced the level of systematics present in the light curve by applying the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; @xcite ) .",
    "a few additional outlying measurements were removed before and after application of tfa .",
    "raw uncertainties on the individual points were scaled to force an ensemble of stars near the target to have a modal @xmath48/dof of unity for a constant fit . as in @xcite ,",
    "the target s @xmath48/dof was still not unity after this adjustment based on the ensemble , so we further scaled the target s error bars by a small amount ( @xmath55 ) to force @xmath48/dof=1 .",
    "the final kelt light curve has 5036 data points taken between nov .",

    "the tycho catalog magnitudes @xcite of our targets are generally unreliable at @xmath56 . in particular",
    ", we find the error bars can sometimes be underestimated at the level of several tenths of a magnitude , resulting in colors that do not agree with spectroscopically - determined values of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , we obtained absolute photometry to supersede and supplement the catalog colors .",

    "cross correlation was performed order by order against the template , and the resulting 35 rv measurements from the individual orders were subjected to a sigma clipping based on the median absolute deviation .",
    "after clipping , we typically were left with rv measurements from 2025 orders , which were averaged for the final rv measurement at that epoch .",

    "note that , although the radial velocity standard is of a different spectral type than tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 , we expect that the systematic error that this mismatch produces will manifest itself primarily as an offset of @xmath88 km  s@xmath2 added to all the absolute rv measurements , with a much lesser effect on the values of the rvs relative to each other .",
    "in table [ tab : obsjournal ] , we present the 20 radial velocities measured by the marvels instrument , and we show the rv curve as a function of time in fig .  [",
    "fig : rvcurve ] .",
    "both beams are shown , and even though the error bars plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvcurve ] are photon - only and do not account for systematics ( our procedure to determine more realistic error bars follows below ) , several of the beamwise pairs nonetheless agree within their error bars .",
    "the marvels pipeline is still under development , and we find the rv scatter for other stars in the same field as tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 ( as well as for stars in other fields ) is on average 23 times larger than the photon noise , on timescales greater than a month ; presumably , most stars observed are not astrophysically variable at this level , indicating that the excess scatter is due to systematics ( note we will discuss the expected rv jitter for tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 in section [ sec : jitter ] , since we need to determine the stellar properties first before searching for cases of similar stars in the literature ) . during pipeline development , we have examined the morphology of the rv residuals in the cases of several reference stars with known rv curves ( either stable or planet - bearing ) and found the systematic errors typically manifest in the form of month - to - month offsets at the level of tens of m  s@xmath2 , such that the rv data within any individual month fits the known rv curve much better than over multiple months .",
    "the offsets are often the same in direction and magnitude for both beams .",
    "these systematic errors may be due to imperfections in the detailed preprocessing of the images , because we do not see these systematics at the same level when analyzing simulated stellar data free of real - world image distortions .",
    "since the exact factor by which the scatter exceeds the photon noise varies from star to star , we have decided to determine the excess scatter for the candidate at hand , to ensure that it falls in the typical range seen for other stars , and so is not responsible for the rv signal which we have interpreted as due to a companion .    our procedure for estimating the magnitude of the systematic errors in the rv curve is as follows .",
    "we assume that the systematic errors can be well - modelled by applying a simple constant multiplicative scaling to the uncertainties derived from the photon noise alone .",
    "we choose to use a multiplicative scaling of the error bars instead of adding a systematic error in quadrature to the statistical error bars because during pipeline development , we found the increase in rv scatter above the photon noise level is larger for fainter stars than brighter stars , so adding systematic error in quadrature would not be able to capture the overall form of the extra error as a function of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we designate this multiplicative scaling factor the `` quality factor '' @xmath89 .",
    "we estimate @xmath89 by performing a keplerian fit to the rv dataset ( with the raw pipeline photon - noise uncertainties ) , allowing for a linear trend with time .",
    "we then find the value of @xmath89 such that the @xmath48/dof of the best - fit is equal to unity .",
    "following this error bar growth procedure , we found that the marvels rvs for tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 were affected by systematics at levels of @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the two beams , respectively .",
    "multiplying the statistical error bars by @xmath89 , we get a median scaled error bar of @xmath92 m  s@xmath2 for beam 1 and @xmath93 m  s@xmath2 for beam 2 . after scaling the error bars , we performed a joint fit to beam 1 and beam 2 to provide a stronger constraint than a fit to either beam alone .",
    "the joint fit allows for different slopes and offsets between the two beams .",
    "this model is required because the two beams traveled through different parts of the instrument , and most importantly , experienced different optical path delays inside the interferometer ( recall from section [ sec : sdssobs ] that there is a multiplicative factor that transforms fringe shift into radial velocity this factor depends on the delay ) .",

    "the higher @xmath89 for the brighter star is not an especially surprising result , since systematic noise sources that are independent of photon counts contribute a higher fraction of the total error when photon noise is small .",

    "[ sec : errbarscaling ]      to further confirm that rv variability is indeed due to a companion , as well as to confirm the basic parameters of the orbital fit , we compared the rv observations obtained from het and smarts to those obtained by the marvels instrument .",
    "we found these rv data do verify the variability and periodicity , but the follow - up data sets comprise insufficient high quality data points to provide much additional refinement of the orbital fit parameters on top of the discovery data .",
    "we first treated each rv dataset independently , computing a separate orbital fit and estimating @xmath89 for the dataset using the procedure described above in  [ sec : marvelsrv ] .",

    "we use these separate fits only for estimating the het and smarts total error bars .    for the het data we find @xmath99 , which is high , but expected due to the preliminary nature of the pipeline used to reduce the data ( see  [ sec : rvfollowup ] ) .",
    "we subtracted the rv model based on the marvels fit from the het points and found that the residuals could be fit by a straight line ( slope and offset ) with @xmath100 and 7 degrees of freedom . under the assumption that the errors are independent and normally distributed , this corresponds to a 33.4% probability of happening by chance , so there is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that the het rvs are consistent with the marvels orbital fit .    for the smarts data we find @xmath101 .",

    "we found that the new period and amplitude derived , using all the data sets combined , matched the values adopted in table [ tab : companionparams ] to within the @xmath103 uncertainties , and furthermore , that the uncertainties themselves matched to within @xmath10410% .",

    "we can also place an upper limit of 0.050% on the maximum light curve variability at a period half that of the period from the rv orbital fit ( at @xmath110 ) , but this limit is insufficient to detect the expected amount of ellipsoidal variability for this candidate system . using the equation in table 2 of @xcite , we calculate the ellipsoidal variation would only be 0.0019% in amplitude .",
    "note the methods we use to calculate the physical parameters for the star and companion used in the equations in this section will be explained later , in  [ sec : finaldet ] .",

    "we consider the uncertainty in the inferred radius of the primary due to the uncertainties in the spectroscopically measured @xmath35 , @xmath120 , and [ fe / h ] ( see  [ sec : finaldet ] ) , and we also consider a uniform range of transit impact parameters . for a given assumed radius for the companion , for each link we can then compute the expected transit curve using the routines of @xcite , which are fit to the kelt dataset , computing the difference in @xmath48 relative to a constant flux fit to the data .",

    "thus , we re - fit the fluxes with @xmath35 fixed at the spectroscopic value of @xmath162k , [ fe / h ] fixed at @xmath163 , and @xmath36 fixed at @xmath164 ; the only remaining free parameters are @xmath155 and the normalization . in this way we use the photometry to strongly constrain the line - of - sight extinction .",

    ", we can also estimate the semimajor axis @xmath181 , assuming an edge - on orbit ; for less inclined orbits , the semimajor axis is larger .",
    "the small minimum mass of the companion positions it as a good short - period brown dwarf desert candidate . in order for it to be a low - mass star rather than a brown dwarf",
    ", the orbital inclination would have to be close to face - on . in order to explore further the probability that the companion has a mass greater than the hydrogen burning limit",
    ", we conducted a bayesian analysis to estimate the posterior probability distribution for the companion mass , using the methodology described in section 7 of @xcite : an mcmc chain is constructed starting from a distribution of stellar parameters and error bars as adopted for tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 in table [ tab : stellarparams ] , stellar masses are determined using @xcite , and companion masses are determined using a random distribution of inclinations .",
    "this analysis assumes a uniform distribution in @xmath182 , includes uncertainties on the orbital and host star parameters , and adopts priors on the luminosity ratio and mass ratio for the companion .",
    "of course , the posterior distribution of the true companion mass depends on our adopted prior for the companion mass ratio distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given that few brown dwarf companions are known , the constraints on the companion mass ratio distribution in the mass regime of interest are poor .",
    "indeed , this is what makes this object interesting , and this distribution is precisely what we would like to infer from a larger ensemble of similar detections .",
    "nevertheless , we can adopt various simple and plausible forms for the mass ratio distribution , and then use these to infer posterior probability distributions for the true mass . from doppler surveys for exoplanets , it is known that jupiter - mass companions are significantly more common than brown dwarf companions , and that the frequency of planetary companions declines for larger masses , such that the mass function is roughly uniform in the logarithm of the planet mass for @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "it is not known if this form holds for companions with mass significantly larger than @xmath184 , but it is clear that the frequency of companions in the brown dwarf regime must reach a minimum at some point and then rise again , given that m dwarf companions with masses just above the hydrogen burning limit are known to be more common than brown dwarf companions .",
    "@xcite found that this minimum ( the driest part of the brown dwarf desert ) occurs at a companion mass of @xmath185 .",
    "thus the minimum mass of marvels-1b is near the minimum of the companion mass function , and prior mass ratio distributions that are falling , flat , or perhaps rising shallowly in @xmath186 are all equally plausible ( see figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore consider five different priors on the companion mass ratio distribution : @xmath187 , @xmath188 , constant , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 .",
    "the first three are falling or constant with @xmath186 , and the latter two are rising with @xmath186 . from the results of @xcite , we believe the first three are the most plausible , while the first four almost certainly bracket the likely range of distributions for companions close to the relevant regime .",
    "the resulting cumulative probabilities for the companion mass for the five different priors are plotted in figure [ fig : bayes ] .",
    "for the three favored priors , we conclude that at @xmath191 confidence the actual mass is below the hydrogen - burning limit . for the prior that is uniform in ( linear ) mass ratio , @xmath192 ,",
    "there is a @xmath193 probability that the companion is in fact a low - mass star , whereas it is only for the assumption of relatively steeply rising mass ratio distribution ( @xmath194 ) that the companion is more likely to be a star .",
    "again , we do not believe such a distribution is very likely to be correct for this regime of companion mass , but given the poor constraints , we can not absolutely exclude it either . finally , we note that for the last two priors , the precise form of the posterior distribution depends on our imposed constraint on the luminosity ratio , which is somewhat uncertain .    with a reddening of @xmath166 (  [ sec : sedfit ] ) , the system is evidently seen much of the way through the full reddening along this line of sight , which from the @xcite dust maps is @xmath195 .",
    "the physical distance of the system can be estimated from its luminosity and apparent magnitude .",
    "first we compute the bolometric magnitude of the star as @xmath196 , where 4.74 is the bolometric magnitude of the sun .",
    "the luminosity is calculated from the stefan - boltzmann law applied to the @xmath35 and stellar radius calculated above , and we adopt a @xmath197 as appropriate for its spectral type ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude is therefore 2.91 . adopting @xmath198 (  [ sec : sedfit ] ) , this yields a distance @xmath199pc .",
    "starspots and motions of the stellar surface are possible astrophysical sources of noise that can interfere with searches for companion rv signals .",
    "these sources are commonly referred to as `` jitter '' , and are explored by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for late f dwarfs of @xmath200",

    "rather , f stars with stellar parameters similar to tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 can be fairly quiet in terms of the rms scatter attributable to rv jitter : @xmath1044 - 5 m  s@xmath2 in the case of the f6 star hd 60532 @xcite , and @xmath10410 m  s@xmath2 in the case of the f7 star hd 89744 @xcite .",

    "we emphasize that we have not directly measured the mass of tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 , and thus we are not attempting to test the accuracy of the stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "rather , our goal is to use these tracks to constrain the evolutionary status of the tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 system .",
    "the spectroscopically measured @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and [ fe / h ] place tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 near the beginning of the subgiant phase , just prior to crossing the hertzsprung gap to the base of the red giant branch , with an estimated age of @xmath208gyr .",
    "we can also take advantage of the information provided by the marvels input catalog to place the host star on an rpm diagram , taking colors from the 2mass catalog , and proper motions from the gsc2.3 ( see @xcite for an example of how rpm can be used to help differentiate giants from dwarfs ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpm ] , we show that the @xmath209-band rpm ( @xmath210 ) is most consistent with the host star being a dwarf or subgiant , as it falls well away from the region of the rpm diagram dominated by giant stars .      given the relatively large mass ratio and short period of the tyc 1240 - 00945 - 1 system , tidal interactions between the star and marvels-1b could be important given the roughly @xmath208gyr age of the host star , is the system likely to be tidally synchronized ?",
    "we follow exactly the same analysis of the tidal interaction as detailed in @xcite , which uses the tidal quality factor of the star , @xmath211 , as a free parameter in the equations for the decay of the companion s semimajor axis over time and the relation of the primary s rotational frequency to the companion s orbital angular momentum ( eqs .  5 and 6 in @xcite ) ; together , the equations permit a solution for the amount of time required for tidal synchronization . note that if the primary s rotation never synchronizes , the two bodies may merge @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we have examined the tidal evolution of this system in the range @xmath212 , for a range of values of the inclination of the secondary s orbit to the line of sight from @xmath213 ( face - on ) to @xmath214 ( edge - on ) , adjusting the mass and rotation period using the measured values of @xmath136 and @xmath173 from  [ sec : params ] .",
    "we set the primary s equator to be in the same plane as the secondary s orbit , but this decision does not affect our results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tides ] we show the synchronization and merging times from eqs .  5 and 6 of @xcite , over the @xmath211 and @xmath177 parameter space defined above .",
    "the curves are isochrones in the ( @xmath211 , @xmath177 ) parameter space , so if the tyc 1240 - 00945 - 1 system has a ( @xmath211 , @xmath177 ) combination that lies above a given isochrone @xmath215 , then the system will take longer than @xmath215 to synchronize or merge .",
    "isochrones are plotted for @xmath216 , 0.1 , 1 , and 10 gyr .",
    "we consider three models : the best - fit stellar parameters ( solid curves ) ; one in which @xmath217 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 ( dotted curves ) ; and one with @xmath220 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath221 , and @xmath222 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the latter two cases represent models where the parameter sets were adjusted in opposite directions in an attempt to have the two models span a maximal amount of ( @xmath223 ) parameter space , while still maintaining the parameters within the uncertainties .",
    "thus , the uncertainty on the four synchronization / merging isochrones is approximately indicated by the region between the dotted and dashed lines ( though it is not a perfect indication of the multi - parameter uncertainty envelope , as is evident from the fact that the dotted and dashed lines cross ) .",
    "note if one makes a trial assumption for the value of the inclination @xmath177 , then given our measurement of @xmath136 , one may infer the true rotational velocity @xmath224 of the stellar surface . at some small inclination , close to a face - on orbit",
    ", this will yield a @xmath224 so high that the primary s rotational frequency is already spun up to tidal synchronization ( and for the improbable case of an inclination even smaller than this , the primary s rotational frequency is higher than the secondary s orbital frequency , a scenario we do not explore here , but which would result in gradual spindown of the primary s rotational frequency until it matched with the orbital frequency of the secondary ) . for each case of @xmath136 that we investigated ,",
    "the value of the inclination which corresponds to present - day tidal synchronization is visible on fig .",
    "[ fig : tides ] as a vertical asymptote towards which the isochrones converge . for inclinations closer to edge - on ,",
    "the secondary still is in the process of spinning up the primary .",
    "next consider the best fit ( solid curves ) and maximum @xmath136 ( dotted curves ) cases .",
    "we find that for a wide range of low ( @xmath211 , @xmath177 ) combinations , the secondary quickly spins the primary up to synchronization in less time than the @xmath208gyr age of the host star .",
    "however , this alone , while suggestive , is not conclusive proof that such a synchronization has occurred . as this is an evolved f star , the radius has recently expanded , complicating any interpretations of the system s history .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath225 , the synchronization time is about the age of the system .    for the minimum @xmath136 cases ( dashed curves ) ,",
    "the rotational period of the star is very large , @xmath28 days .",
    "while this period may not be physical , it is formally permitted by the observations . with such slow rotation",
    ", the companion may merge with the star before synchronization is finished .",
    "this possibility of the synchronization timescale exceeding the merging timescale occurs when @xmath226 ( note there is no feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : tides ] at the @xmath227 transition , because in our simplified model a companion can reach the stellar surface and synchronize the star s rotation period , or move just inside the surface and merge ) .",
    "undoubtedly the behavior of such a compact system is not well - modeled by eqs .  5 and 6 of @xcite , but we can not rule out the possibility that marvels-1b will eventually merge with the host star .",
    "in a search through the first year of sdss - iii marvels data , we have discovered marvels-1b , a candidate brown dwarf companion to the @xmath228 star tyc  1240 - 00945 - 1 with a velocity semiamplitude of @xmath229 km  s@xmath2 and an unusually short period of @xmath230d .",
    "radial velocity data from several observatories confirm the doppler variability , and high - resolution spectroscopic observations indicate that the host is a mildly evolved , slightly subsolar metallicity f star with @xmath231k , @xmath232 , and [ fe / h]=@xmath233 , with an inferred mass of @xmath234 .",
    "the minimum mass of marvels-1b is @xmath5 , implying that it is most likely in the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we see no evidence for spectral lines from the companion in the high - resolution spectra , implying that the companion is not an m dwarf with an orbit extremely close to pole - on .",
    "comprehensive , precise relative photometry indicates no variability at a level of @xmath235 on time scales of hours to years . phasing to the period of marvels-1b as well as the first harmonic",
    ", we can place an upper limit on the amplitude of coherent photometric variability of @xmath236 . under many ( but not all ) of the potential combinations of system parameters ,",
    "this short - period system is likely to have tidally synchronized , given the estimated @xmath208gyr age of the host star .",
    "the _ a priori _ transit probability of marvels-1b is quite high , @xmath7 .",
    "although we find no evidence for transits , we also can not definitively rule them out for likely marvels-1b radii of @xmath237 . the transit ephemeris is @xmath238(bjd@xmath239 ) , with an expected transit depth of @xmath240 , and a duration of @xmath241hours for a central transit .",
    "we believe this candidate highlights the great promise of marvels as a factory for finding the rare companions that populate the brown dwarf desert .",
    "the primary goal of the marvels survey is to monitor @xmath242 main sequence and subgiant stars with velocity precision sufficient to detect jovian companions with periods of less than a few years .",
    "as such , marvels is uniquely and exquisitely sensitive to massive but rare companions .",
