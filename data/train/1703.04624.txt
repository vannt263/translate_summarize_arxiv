    "there are geological evidence that earth had to face multiple episodes of global ( or quasi - global ) glaciation , at the end of the archean 2.45 - 2.22 gyrs ago and during the neoproterozoic era 710 and 650 myears ago @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the carbonate@xmath0silicate cycle @xcite was the main agent to trigger deglaciations on past earth .",
    "in particular , on a completely frozen planet , also called hard snowball , the weathering of co@xmath1 is stopped ; continuous volcanic outgassing builds up atmospheric co@xmath1 , which warms up the climate until liquid water is produced in the equatorial regions .    by extension",
    ", this mechanism may be crucial to stabilize the climate of earth - like exoplanets .",
    "it is even central for the definition of the classical habitable zone @xcite , which assumes that planets can build up co@xmath1 atmospheres ( as massive as wanted ) suitable for the stability of surface liquid water .",
    "planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may suffer , as earth did , episodes of total glaciation .",
    "recent work by @xcite has even shown that , in case of planets lacking land vascular plants , temperate climates may not be stable , because at high co@xmath1 partial pressure , the increased weathering rate does not allow temperate stable solutions .",
    "this effect , enhanced for planets weakly irradiated by their star , may drive systematically earth - like exoplanets toward episodes of glaciation .    can earth - like planets in the habitable zone of their star always escape from episodes of glaciation ? in this work ,",
    "we use 3d - global climate model simulations of snowball planets to study the ability of the increased co@xmath1 greenhouse effect resulting from the carbonate - silicate cycle to drive them out of glaciation . as",
    "the co@xmath1 outgassed by volcanoes accumulate in the atmosphere , the temperature of condensation of co@xmath1 can exceed the surface temperature of the poles .",
    "this lead to the trapping of extra outgassed co@xmath1 , forming permanent co@xmath1 polar ice caps , and therefore seriously limits the efficiency of the carbonate@xmath0silicate cycle .",
    "this possibility has already been suggested by @xcite and @xcite , but has never been explored yet .",
    "we propose in this paper a detailed study of this scenario .",
    "we use in this paper the 3-dimensions lmd generic global climate model to study the deglaciation of earth - like planets orbiting circularly around a sun - like star ( sun spectrum and luminosity ) in response to increasing amount of atmospheric co@xmath1 ( from 0.01 to 3  bars ) , and for orbital distances ranging from 1.10 to 1.45 astronomical units ( au ) .",
    "detailed information on the model can be found in appendix  [ appen_lmd_model ] .",
    "our simulations were designed to represent completely frozen earth - like planet characteristics .",
    "these include the radius ( 6370  km ) , the gravity field ( 9.81  m  s@xmath4 ) , the obliquity ( 23.5@xmath8 ) and the rotation speed ( 7.28@xmath1310@xmath14 rad  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the roles of obliquity , planetary mass and rotation rate on the ability of planets to escape glaciation episodes are discussed in sections  [ null_obliquity_section ]  and  [ sensitivity ] .",
    "eventually , most of the simulations were performed for a uniformly flat topography .",
    "the effect of topography is discussed in section  [ topography ] .",
    "all the simulations performed in this study were forced initially in a cold and dry state , which assumes :    1 .   a uniform and complete ice cover .",
    "2 .   atmospheric temperatures arbitrarily fixed to 230  kelvins everywhere .",
    "no water vapor , no clouds .",
    "depending on co@xmath1 partial pressure , obliquity , or parameterization of clouds , the simulations evolve in different steady state climate regimes that are discussed in the next section .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     \\1 . melting , freezing , condensation , evaporation , sublimation and precipitation of h@xmath1o physical processes are all included in the model . in the atmosphere",
    ", water vapor can condense into water ice particles clouds . at the surface",
    ", we fix the h@xmath1o ice albedo at 0.6 and we use an emissivity of 1 .    \\2 . in our model , co@xmath1 can condense to form co@xmath1 ice clouds and surface frost if the temperature drops below the saturation temperature .",
    "atmospheric co@xmath1 ice particles are sedimented and thus can accumulate at the surface .",
    "the co@xmath1 ice layer formed at the surface can sublimate and recycle the co@xmath1 in the atmosphere .",
    "the co@xmath1 ice on the surface contributes to the surface albedo calculation : if the co@xmath1 ice layer exceeds a threshold value of 1  mm thickness , then the local surface albedo is set immediately to the albedo of co@xmath1 ice ( 0.6 in this work ) . on mars ,",
    "the albedo of co@xmath1 ice can substantially vary @xcite with insolation and presence of dust . without dust ,",
    "the albedo can become very high so that 0.6 is probably a lower estimate .",
    "for co@xmath1 ice , we use an emissivity of 0.9 .",
    "the radiative effect of co@xmath1 ice clouds is discussed in details in section  [ co2_cloud_section ]    physical parameters used for both co@xmath1 and h@xmath1o ices are summarized in table  [ param_ices ] .",
    "what happens once co@xmath1 ice caps have reached their maximum size , as calculated in section  [ max_reservoir_co2 ] ? using calculations , we show in the following lines that , depending on few parameters , the co@xmath1 ice caps when full may ( or may not ) be stable .    the total mass of co@xmath1 available at the surface and in the atmosphere is : @xmath16 with a the area of the co@xmath1 ice caps , s the total area of the surface ( i.e. 4@xmath17r@xmath18 ) and @xmath19 the thickness of the co@xmath1 ice caps averaged over a. when co@xmath1 ice caps are full , @xmath20 .",
    "let s assume that the system  initially with full co@xmath1 ice caps  is sightly perturbated from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . by conservation of co@xmath1 mass ,",
    "the new mass of co@xmath1 ice caps is @xmath23 $ ]  =  @xmath24\\footnote{hereafter ,   ' [ ' and ' ] ' are used to bracket variables . }",
    "$ ] .",
    "we know first from gcm simulations that the area of the ice caps a is not a monotonic function of @xmath33 ( see figure  [ condens_plots ] ) .",
    "instead , as @xmath33 grows , @xmath34 should be positive and then at some point become negative .",
    "figure  [ condens_plots]b ( 23.5@xmath35 obliquity , inactive co@xmath1 clouds ) tells us that the maximum of a(@xmath33 ) should roughly lie at 1  bar in this specific configuration .",
    "it is possible to derive an analytical - complicated yet - expression of @xmath36 using the relation that served to compute figure  [ 2d_basal_melting ] .",
    "it tells us that , whatever the configuration , @xmath36 is in fact always negative , because as pco@xmath1 increases , surface temperature also increases , which limits the thickness of co@xmath1 ice caps shows that the mean thickness of co@xmath1 ice caps is proportional to the maximum thickness calculated by basal melting . ] ( see equation  [ conductivity ] ) .    for the experiment described in previous section ( 1.30  au",
    ", 23.5@xmath35 obliquity , inactive co@xmath1 clouds , co@xmath1 partial pressure of 1  bar ) , we assume @xmath37 and we have therefore ( with @xmath38 , see section  [ co2_rad_extent ] ) : @xmath39 from our calculations , this condition is valid for internal heat flux lower than 80  mw  m@xmath4 .",
    "it means that , for internal heat flux lower than 80  mw  m@xmath4 : ( 1 ) co@xmath1 ice caps when full would not be stable , and ( 2 ) the maximum amount of co@xmath1 that can be trapped in the @xmath40surface , atmosphere@xmath41 system is attained for pco@xmath1 lower than 1  bar .    for internal heat flux",
    "higher than 80  mw  m@xmath4 , because a significant fraction of co@xmath1 is in the gaseous phase : ( 1 ) co@xmath1 ice caps when full would be stable ( until @xmath34 term becomes significant ) , and ( 2 ) the maximum amount of co@xmath1 trapped in the @xmath40surface , atmosphere@xmath41 system occurs for pco@xmath1 larger than 1  bar .        ,",
