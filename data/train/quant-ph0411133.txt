    "the problem of measuring the quantum phase has been a very long standing one in quantum mechanics , since londons@xcite and dirac s first attempts @xcite in the late twenties .",
    "one of the main motivations is that the estimation of the phase shift experienced by a quantum system is the only way of measuring time with high precision in quantum mechanics , since we lack a time observable .",
    "this posed the problem of quantum phase estimation naturally within the framework of frequency standards based on atomic clocks @xcite , and more generally , in high precision measurements and interferometry , the typical scenario in which the sensitivity of phase estimation is profitably used .",
    "more recently , the encoding of information into the relative phase of quantum systems is exploited in quantum computation and communication .",
    "in fact , in quantum computing most of the existing quantum algorithms can be regarded as multiparticle interferometers , with the output of the computation encoded in the relative phase between different paths @xcite . on the other hand , in some cryptographic communication protocols ( e. g. bb84@xcite )",
    "information is encoded into phase properties .",
    "the above numerous applications had focused a great deal of interest on the problem of optimal phase estimation , which has been widely studied in a thousand of papers ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) since the beginning of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the first satisfactory partial solution of the problem appeared in the late 70 s ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) , and these works are generally regarded as one of the major successes of quantum estimation theory and covariant measurements , allowing a first consistent definition of phase , without the problems suffered by the original definition proposed by dirac @xcite in terms of an alleged observable conjugated to the number operator of the harmonic oscillator .    in the covariant treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite the estimated parameter is a phase shift resulting from the action of a circle group of unitary transformations , with generator a selfadjoint operator with purely integer spectrum .",
    "a generalization of this method to degenerate phase - shift generator has been presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "such general approach can be applied to any input pure state , along with a restricted class of mixed states , the so called _ phase - pure states _ @xcite .    the possibility of efficiently estimating the phase for mixed states is of fundamental interest for practical implementations , in the presence of unavoidable noise which generally turns pure states into mixed , and for estimation of local phase - shift on entangled states . as a matter of fact",
    ", the freedom in the choice of the optimal measurement which results from degenerate shift operators@xcite opens the problem of the stability of the quality of the estimation with increasing mixing of the shifted state .",
    "the problem of optimal phase estimation on mixed states is also very relevant conceptually , the phase being one of the most elusive quantum concepts .",
    "the main reason why the problem of optimal phase estimation on mixed states has never been addressed systematically so far is due to the intrinsic technical difficulties faced in any quantum estimation problem with mixed states . in this paper",
    "we derive the optimal measurement for phase estimation on qubits in mixed states , for an arbitrary number @xmath0 of qubits prepared in the same state , using either the uhlman fidelity or the periodicized variance as a figure of merit .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath0 identical qubits prepared in the same mixed state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the three pauli matrices .",
    "the total state of the @xmath0 qubits is described by the density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the phase transformation @xmath5 is generated by the @xmath6 component of the total angular momentum @xmath7 , namely @xmath8^{\\otimes n}\\label{shift}\\ ] ] the problem is now to estimate the unknown phase - shift @xmath9 on the known state @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a covariant measurement , namely we require that the efficiency of the measurement procedure does not depend on the value of the phase to be estimated . in this case , without loss of generality we can assume that the initial state @xmath11 has no component along @xmath12 , corresponding to real matrix @xmath11 in the @xmath13 representation .",

    "the fact that @xmath14 is a povm corresponds to the constraints @xmath15 in the quantum estimation approach the optimality is defined by maximizing the average of a given figure of merit @xmath16 , assuming a uniform prior distribution of the parameter @xmath9 @xmath17\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proved that the solution for an estimation problem covariant under a unitary group representation can be written as the group orbit under the same representation of a fixed positive operator @xmath19 ( called _ seed _ of the povm ) , and for the present case one has @xmath20 in the following we will denote by @xmath21 an orthonormal basis , with @xmath22 denoting the eigenvalues of @xmath23 , which label the equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the group @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is a degeneration index , corresponding to the multiplicity space of the representation @xmath22 .",

    "the most commonly adopted criteria are the periodicized variance @xmath31 or the ( opposite of the ) fidelity between the true and the estimated states , which for mixed states has the well known uhlman s form@xcite @xmath32 ^ 2\\,,\\label{eq : uhlman}\\ ] ] which for qubits simplifies as follows@xcite @xmath33 both cost functions depend on @xmath9 only through its cosine , whence we need to maximize the averaged @xmath34 , namely @xmath35\\ , .",
