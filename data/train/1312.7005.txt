    "it can be shown for example that if the energy shift induced by a single @xmath2-function scatterer situated in between two walls is reinterpreted in terms of the interaction present in the fermionic hamiltonian ( 2 ) , the second order of the taylor expansion in the powers of its prefactor , proportional to @xmath13 , turns out to be positive , contradicting the non - positivity of the second order perturbation theory shift ; see problem 4.1.11 in @xcite .",

    "<S> in this article , we consider the monopole excitations of the harmonically trapped bose gas in the vicinity of the tonks - girardeau limit . </S>",
    "<S> using girardeau s fermi - bose duality and subsequently an effective fermion - fermion odd - wave interaction , we obtain the dominant correction to the scale - invariance - protected value of the excitation frequency , for microscopically small excitation amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we produce a series of diffusion monte carlo results that confirm our analytic prediction for three particles . and </S>",
    "<S> less expectedly , our result stands in excellent agreement with the result of a hydrodynamic simulation ( with the lieb - liniger equation of state as an input ) of the microscopically large but macroscopically small excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the frequency we obtain coincides with the upper bound derived by menotti and stringari using sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , however , we found that the usually successful hydrodynamic perturbation theory predicts a shift that is @xmath0 higher than its _ ab initio _ numerical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the sharp boundary of the cloud in local density approximation  characterized by an infinite density gradient  renders the perturbation inapplicable . </S>",
    "<S> all our results also directly apply to the 3d @xmath1-wave - interacting waveguide - confined confined fermions . </S>"
