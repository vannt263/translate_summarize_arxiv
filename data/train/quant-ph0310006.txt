    "photoassociation ( pa ) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for acquiring information about the collisional properties of laser - cooled atoms .",
    "it has revealed a rich array of high - resolution spectroscopic data for alkali diatomic molecules @xcite and provided a means of testing calculations of molecular dynamics .",
    "it has also led to good estimates of the s - wave scattering length @xcite that determines the behavior of ultra - cold dilute gases near quantum degeneracy .",
    "the case of @xmath3he atoms in the metastable @xmath4 state ( he@xmath5 ) is distinctive in that each atom carries a large internal energy of 20 ev .",
    "photoassociation experiments with he@xmath5 were first demonstrated by herschbach _",
    "et al . _ with atoms trapped in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite .",
    "however , the quantitative study of pair interactions has still to be completed . in particular , although bose einstein condensation ( bec ) has been achieved in he@xmath5 @xcite , the scattering length remains uncertain .",
    "what is more , the accurate investigation of collisional properties @xcite and of the dynamical behavior @xcite of the ultra - cold he@xmath5 gas suffers from the uncertainty in the scattering length . in order to extract quantitative information from pa spectroscopy",
    "we have performed a new pa experiment starting from a magnetically trapped and evaporatively cooled metastable helium gas .",
    "we have thereby achieved greater state selectivity , higher density , and lower temperature than were obtained previously @xcite .    as a preliminary step toward the characterization of pair interactions ,",
    "we have reported @xcite the observation of purely long - range helium dimers produced by photoassociation of metastable helium atoms , with the pa laser tuned close to the @xmath6 atomic line ( see figure [ fig : principe_pa ] ) .",
    "the novelty of these dimers is that they are produced from two highly excited atoms and therefore carry a huge internal energy of 40 ev .",
    "however , whereas one might expect the molecules to decay through autoionization , the primary decay mechanism is radiative .",
    "this fact allowed us to develop an original , `` calorimetric '' detection method based on the strong heating of the atomic cloud at resonant pa frequencies . our preliminary model for the heating accounts for the conversion of a decaying molecule s vibrational kinetic energy into additional thermal energy within the cloud .",
    "autoionization appears to have a negligible effect , probably because the inner turning points for these giant dimers are so far apart ( around 150 bohr radii ) .",
    "ionization is unlikely at such distances , so it is not surprising that these molecular states have not been observed with the ion detectors used in mot experiments @xcite .     molecular bound state .",
    "the potential curve for the @xmath7 state is the one given by @xcite , the @xmath1 is the one obtained by the calculation described in the text . note the change in energy and length scales between the @xmath7 and the purely long - range @xmath1 potential wells.,height=264 ]    the present paper is meant to provide a theoretical complement to reference @xcite , which focused primarily on experimental methods and results . because @xmath3he has no hyperfine structure , the theoretical approach is relatively simple as compared with alkali systems .",
    "thus , giant helium dimers present an interesting case study , and we have attempted to emphasize important physical concepts in somewhat of a tutorial approach . in particular , a perturbative description of the electronic potentials is given , which provides a physical understanding of the formation of these molecules .",
    "then , with a single - channel adiabatic calculation of the effective molecular potentials we find purely long - range spectra that are in excellent agreement with those computed in @xcite by more sophisticated techniques .    in section [ section : shifts ]",
    ", after a brief review of the experiment , we relate the molecular binding energy to the measured resonance frequency by subtracting shifts due to the magnetic trapping potential and the non - zero temperature of the atomic cloud . in particular , the free - bound character of the transitions leads to temperature - induced shifts which do not exist in the case of bound - bound transitions .",
    "section [ section : rovib structure ] describes the calculation of the long - range part of the @xmath8 - @xmath2 molecular interaction potentials , as well as the theoretical values for the binding energies of the giant dimers .",
    "our perturbative approach shows how purely long - range potential wells arise from the competition between the dipole - dipole interaction and the atomic fine structure .",
    "finally , we compare both the experimental and theoretical determinations of the binding energies . with its high accuracy , the experiment provides a clear illustration of retardation effects in the electromagnetic interaction and of tiny corrections due to the vibration - induced coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , it yields a measurement of the radiative decay rate @xmath9 of the atomic excited state @xmath2 with an accuracy of @xmath10 .",

    "after the pa laser pulse and further thermalization , the remaining atoms are detected optically : a ) atom number , b ) temperature in @xmath11k and c ) peak optical density versus the pa laser detuning from the atomic @xmath12 line .",
    "each point represents a new evaporated cloud after pa pulse illumination , thermalization and ballistic expansion .",
    "the curves in graphs a ) and c ) indicate the averaging of data over 5 adjacent points .",
    "the curve in graph b ) is a lorentzian fit to the data with a width of 2.8 mhz .",
    "strong heating of the atomic cloud is observed when the pa laser is resonant with a molecular transition.,height=245 ]    we perform pa experiments with a cold metastable helium gas confined in a magnetic trap .",
    "the atomic cloud is cooled by rf - induced evaporation to a temperature in the @xmath11k range , just above the bec transition @xcite .",
    "the cloud is illuminated for a short period ( 0.1 to 10 ms ) by a low - intensity pa laser beam and then allowed to thermalize for a few hundred ms .",
    "it is subsequently released and then detected optically after a few - ms expansion time .",
    "giant helium dimers are produced when a free ( unbound ) pair of cold atoms absorbs a pa photon and is excited into a bound state of the purely long - range potential .",
    "this free - bound transition occurs when the pa laser is tuned red of the @xmath6 ( @xmath12 ) atomic line ( see figure [ fig : principe_pa ] ) .",
    "several resonance lines appear in the recorded temperature data , indicating that the formation of transient molecules results in the deposition of energy in the surrounding atomic cloud .",
    "figure [ fig : data_v4 ] illustrates the typical data obtained when we tune the pa laser in the vicinity of a bound state in the @xmath1 potential well . although few atoms are lost ( figure [ fig : data_v4]-a ) , a strong increase in temperature ( figure [ fig : data_v4]-b ) and consequently a strong decrease in peak optical density ( figure [ fig : data_v4]-c ) are monitored . since the cloud is very cold ( typically @xmath13k )",
    ", the excitation of relatively few molecules is enough to cause significant heating .",
    "thus , the atomic cloud serves as a sensitive calorimeter capable of detecting the position of the molecular lines with an accuracy of 0.5 mhz . the quantitative study of the heating mechanism is in progress and will be published in a separate paper .      acquiring experimental spectra",
    "consists in measuring the pa laser detunings at which molecular lines are resonantly excited in the magnetically trapped atomic cloud . for an accurate interpretation of the data ,",
    "we need to take into account the correct lineshape function , which may include shifts and/or asymmetric broadening due to various mechanisms .",
    "we do so on the basis of the following calculation of the molecular binding energy , which emerges straightforwardly from the conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "the energy @xmath14 of a pair of trapped atoms in the initial unbound state can be written : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the he atom , @xmath17 is the momentum of the pair s center of mass , @xmath18 is the relative momentum , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the magnetic field at the location of each atom , and @xmath21 is the magnetic dipole moment of an atom in the @xmath4 state ( the land factor being 2 , we define @xmath22 , with the bohr magneton @xmath23 ) . in expression ( [ eq : initial energy ] ) , we neglect any interaction energy between the two atoms",
    ". this will be justified below .",
    "after the pair of atoms absorbs a photon with momentum @xmath24 and frequency @xmath25 , the binding energy @xmath26 of the resulting molecule can be inferred from the conservation law for energy and momentum : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the final momentum of the molecule and @xmath29 is the energy of the @xmath12 line ( for an isolated atom in a zero magnetic field ) .",
    "the difference between the molecular binding energy and the pa laser detuning @xmath30 is thus given by : @xmath31 any dependence of the molecular level energy on the magnetic field ( zeeman effect ) or on the density ( mean field interaction of the molecule with the surrounding atomic and/or molecular cloud ) is _ a priori _ included in @xmath32 , which may therefore also depend on the position of the molecule .",
    "note that the relative kinetic energy term @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq : binging energy ] ) would not appear in the case of a bound - bound transition , since it would be implicitly included in the initial binding energy .",
    "as it is always positive , it contributes an _",
    "asymmetric _ lineshape , and consequently a mean shift @xcite .",
    "also , the harmonic magnetic trapping potential contains quadratic terms which contribute to the inhomogeneous , asymmetric broadening and shift of the lines .",
    "however , the temperature is low enough that the asymmetric broadening terms remain much smaller than the natural lorentzian width .",
    "thus , the only effect is a shift of the peak position of the lines , which can be calculated by averaging equation ( [ eq : binging energy ] ) over the distribution function for the initial pair of free atoms .      the distribution function for the pairs _ that undergo the pa transition _ is the thermal distribution for a pair of trapped atoms _ multiplied _ by the transition probability .",
    "according to the franck - condon overlap principle , the latter is proportional to the square of the overlap between the initial and final radial wave functions .",
    "since the excited state is a bound state , the overlap is peaked at the condon radius @xmath34 close to the classical outer turning point . according to table [ tab : results ] in section [ section : rovib structure ] , the transition occurs mainly for an internuclear distance @xmath35 nm , which is much smaller than the size of the atomic cloud ( @xmath36 m at @xmath37k ) .",
    "this allows us to use the approximation @xmath38 in equations ( [ eq : initial energy ] ) and ( [ eq : binging energy ] ) , where @xmath39 is the center of mass of the pair .",
    "furthermore , because the temperature is so low , the collision between two atoms occurs in the s - wave scattering regime , for which the relative angular momentum @xmath40 has no component orthogonal to the internuclear axis .",
    "thus , the vectorial character of @xmath41 can be ignored , since there is only one degree of freedom for the relative motion of the colliding atoms . for internuclear distances",
    "@xmath42 close to @xmath34 , the radial part @xmath43 of the ground state wave function can be approximated as @xmath44 since @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 representing the s - wave scattering length ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the distribution function for a pair of trapped atoms in the s - wave scattering regime absorbing a pa photon is found to be proportional to : @xmath47      i)average over the center - of - mass momentum .",
    "+ the first term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : binging energy ] ) is responsible for the doppler profile .",
    "it produces no average shift , since there is _ a priori _ no correlation between the momenta of the two atoms and of the photon : @xmath48 .",
    "however , it is responsible for a symmetric broadening of the lines , which scales like @xmath49 ( @xmath50 , the temperature of the cold gas ) . in the microk range of temperature , this doppler broadening turns out to be small compared with the natural lifetime broadening of the molecular states probed .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eq : binging energy ] ) is the recoil energy of the molecule after absorbing the photon . in units of @xmath51 ,",
    "its numerical value is @xmath52 khz , which is well below our experimental accuracy .",
    "therefore we neglect the corresponding shift .",
    "+ ii ) average over the center of mass position .",
    "+ using expression ( [ eq : distrib ] ) , the average over the positions @xmath53 and @xmath54 turns out to be an average over the position @xmath39 of the center of mass of the pair .",
    "the shift induced by the external trapping potential is thus calculated to be : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is twice the zeeman shift of one atom at the center of the trap , and @xmath57 is the average of the harmonic trapping potential energy , according to the equipartition theorem for quadratic energy terms .",
    "as already noted , the binding energy @xmath58 _ a priori _ also depends on the center of mass position , and should therefore be averaged as well .",
    "however , we neglect this position dependence , since the effect of both the inhomogeneous magnetic field ( molecular zeeman effect ) and density ( atom - molecule interaction ) turn out to be small compared with our experimental accuracy , as discussed below .",
    "+ iii ) average over the relative momentum .",
    "+ making use of expression ( [ eq : distrib ] ) , we find the average of the relative kinetic energy term : @xmath59 where the denominator normalizes the distribution function .",
    "let us mention that while there is only one degree of freedom for the relative momentum ( in the s - wave scattering regime ) , our inclusion of the pair distribution function leads us coincidentally to the same @xmath60 that one finds when treating three classical degrees of freedom .",
    "+ iv ) other shift mechanisms .",
    "+ the mean - field interaction due to the surrounding medium on both the initial and final states of the transition can cause density - dependent shifts of the lines . as far as the initial pair of free atoms is concerned , the mean field interaction energy is @xmath61 , where the atomic density @xmath62 @xmath63 , the s - wave scattering length @xmath64 nm @xcite , and @xmath65 kg . in units of @xmath51 ,",
    "the upper bound for this mean - field interaction is less than @xmath66 khz , which is below our experimental accuracy and therefore negligible .",
    "the mean field energy shift of the final molecular state , which would appear as a density - dependent term in the experimental binding energy , has not been detected experimentally .",
    "finally , light - induced line shifts are completely negligible , since the spectra were measured with pa laser intensities well below the atomic saturation intensity .",
    "+ v ) summary . + in our experiment , each molecular line produces a resonant increase in temperature as a function of pa detuning @xmath67 .",
    "each resonance line is fit by a lorentzian .",
    "the fit s center frequency @xmath68 is taken to be the resonant frequency for excitation to vibrational level @xmath69 .",
    "accounting for the corrections described above , we infer the molecular binding energy @xmath70 of this vibrational level to be : @xmath71      we have measured @xmath68 , @xmath72 and @xmath50 for the lines @xmath73 through @xmath74 in the @xmath1 potential well , for @xmath75 to @xmath76 gauss and for @xmath77 to 30 @xmath11k .",
    "the temperature of the gas was varied by changing the final rf frequency of the evaporation ramp above the critical temperature .",
    "consequently , the atomic density was also varied from @xmath78 to @xmath79 at@xmath80@xmath81 .",
    "potential well for the vibrational level @xmath82 : illustration of the dependence of the measured detuning @xmath68 on the magnetic field @xmath72 , after correction from the temperature - induced shift ( see equation ( [ eq : e3 ] ) ) .",
    "the slope of the linear fit is compatible with the expected dependence in @xmath72 ( see in the text).,height=226 ]    in equation [ eq : e3 ] the most important correction is due to @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : b0_dependence ] shows the dependence on @xmath72 of the measured detuning @xmath68 of the @xmath82 line , after it is corrected for the temperature - induced effect ( @xmath83 ) . if the magnetic field is measured in units of @xmath84 , a linear fit to the data gives a slope of @xmath85 .",
    "given equation ( [ eq : e3 ] ) , the contribution of the initial pair of free cold atoms ( the  ground \" state ) , should be exactly @xmath86 . a deviation from this value",
    "could be attributed to the contribution of the mean zeeman effect of the molecular bound (  excited \" ) state .",
    "as the @xmath1 electronic state is non degenerate , the molecule can not have any magnetic dipole moment except one induced by the molecular rotation , which is expected to be of the order of the nuclear magneton , or about three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath87 .",
    "given the experimental accuracy and the range of magnetic field explored , the correspondingly small zeeman effect would be difficult to measure .",
    "but our data permit us to set an upper bound of @xmath88 on the molecular magnetic dipole moment .",
    "this result justifies neglecting the molecular zeeman effect in the calculation of the mean line shifts .",
    "potential well : illustration , in the case of the vibrational level @xmath74 , of the dependence of the measured detuning @xmath68 on the temperature and on the density , after correction from the magnetically - induced shift ( see equation ( [ eq : e3 ] ) ) .",
    "data are displayed before ( squares ) and after ( circles ) applying the temperature - dependent correction .",
    "error bars include uncertainty in the measurements of @xmath67 , @xmath72 , and @xmath50.,height=226 ]    figure [ fig : t_n_dependence ] displays the measured position of the @xmath74 line , corrected for the magnetically - induced shift ( @xmath89 ) , as function of the atomic cloud density . data with ( circles ) and without ( squares ) the additional temperature - dependent correction are shown .",
    "the uncorrected data has been displayed in order to illustrate the importance of the temperature effect ( up to 2 mhz at @xmath90k ) as compared to the experimental accuray ( 0.5 mhz ) .",
    "for this set of data , the density was increased simply by further evaporative cooling of the gas .",
    "thus , higher density is associated with lower temperature , and the temperature - induced shift indicated by the squares nearly vanishes for large density .",
    "it should be noted here that the size of the molecules ( @xmath91 nm , see table [ tab : results ] ) is not vanishingly small compared with mean inter - atomic distance in the cloud ( @xmath92 nm at @xmath93 at/@xmath81 ) . under these conditions , one might expect to find a density- dependent shift due to the mean field interaction between the molecule and the surrounding atomic medium .",
    "however , no such shift is evident in our data after we apply the corrections for temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the error bars include experimental uncertainty in @xmath67 , @xmath72 and @xmath50 . additional scatter of about @xmath94 mhz can be attributed to the uncertainty in the pa laser frequency lock .",
    "we have studied the stability of the experiment and the possible sources of systematic error in all achievable parameter ranges ( accumulating many more data than are shown in figure [ fig : t_n_dependence ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the binding energy for @xmath74 is @xmath95 mhz , in units of @xmath51 .",
    "finally , from figure [ fig : t_n_dependence ] and from the 0.5 mhz uncertainty , we can infer that the density - induced energy shift of the molecules must be smaller than @xmath96 khz per @xmath97 @xmath63 of density . actually , the atomic bose gas surrounding the molecule is near resonance and therefore has a permittivity that differs from the vacuum value . for an ideally homogeneous medium ,",
    "the permittivity would enter in the resonant dipole potential @xcite , leading to a density - dependent term in the binding energy which would be at least a factor two above our upper bound .",
    "since we do not detect this effect , we conclude our gas can not be considered as an homogeneous medium on the size scale of a molecule .",
    "this point may deliver important information about the three - particle correlation function in the atomic gas and would require further study , but it has not been investigated so far .",
    "similar data were registered for the other vibrational lines that we were able to measure .",
    "the experimental results for the binding energies are reported in table [ tab : comparison ] , section [ section : rovib structure ] .",
    "in order to interpret the measurements described above , we now develop the calculation of the long - range interaction of one atom in the @xmath4 state , and another one in the @xmath98 state .",
    "it happens that some of the resulting potential energy curves have minima at very large internuclear distance and support purely long - range bound states .",
    "in particular , the calculated spectrum of five vibrational states in the @xmath1 potential will be shown to be in excellent agreement with our measurements .",
    "the general task for calculating molecular potentials in @xmath3he consists in solving the following schrdinger equation @xcite : @xmath100 here , @xmath101 is a stationary solution corresponding to a set of quantum numbers @xmath102 to be detailed later .",
    "the hamiltonian written above appears as the sum of four terms @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 which represent respectively the kinetic energy of the two nuclei , the kinetic energy of the four electrons , the non relativistic interaction between the six charged particles , and the relativistic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this operator is written as function of the positions of the nuclei @xmath107 , and of the electrons @xmath108 , and as function of the spin coordinates @xmath109 of the four electrons .",
    "the @xmath3he nuclei have no spin . to solve this very complicated problem",
    ", we adopt a perturbative approach , in which we consider the internuclear distance large enough that the interaction potential @xmath105 can be treated as a perturbation of the system of two independent atoms @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_general ] ) is approximated as follows : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are respectively the non - relativistic and relativistic part of the hamiltonian for one isolated atom , and @xmath115 stands for the long - range electrostatic interaction between the two atoms , whose leading term is the retarded dipole - dipole interaction .    to describe long - range molecular interactions , we expand the molecular state in linear combinations of ( entangled ) atomic states ( lcao approximation ) . moreover , according to the usual born - oppenheimer approximation we first consider only the electronic degrees of freedom while keeping the nuclei ( more precisely , the atomic centers of mass ) fixed .",
    "we then treat both the dipole - dipole interaction and the atomic fine structure as perturbations of the non - relativistic hamiltonian for two independent atoms .",
    "we write the two interactions in the basis set of states formed by the tensorial product of isolated non relativistic atomic states : @xmath116 .",
    "considering one atomic orbital in the @xmath8 state and another one in the @xmath2 state , the space of states is of dimension 54 . as the two nuclei are identical , the hamiltonian is unchanged under the inversion @xmath117 of all the electrons with respect to the center of mass @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath117 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_approx ] ) and has two eigenvalues @xmath118 with eigenstates labeled _ gerade _ ( @xmath119 ) and _ ungerade _",
    "( @xmath120 ) respectively .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction @xmath115 , first , only couples the orbital angular momenta of the two independent non - relativistic atoms .",
    "it is diagonal in the hund s case ( a ) basis set labelled @xmath121 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these states can be written as follows in the atomic basis : @xmath122 here , @xmath123 is the total electronic spin of the molecule ( @xmath1240 , 1 or 2 ) , @xmath125 is the projection onto the molecular axis of the electronic orbital angular momentum of the molecule . in the hund s case ( a ) basis , the retarded dipole - dipole interaction is respectively given by @xcite :    [ eq:_retarded_dipole_all ] @xmath126 @xmath127    for @xmath128 states ( [ eq:_retarded_dipole_1 ] ) , and @xmath129 states ( [ eq:_retarded_dipole_2 ] ) . the coefficient @xmath130 is related to the atomic dipole matrix element @xmath131 , and thus to the radiative life time @xmath132 of the atomic transition : @xmath133 with @xmath134 the vacuum permittivity .",
    "the fine structure splitting is small enough that we assume the three atomic lines of interest ( @xmath135 ) have the same wavelength @xmath136 nm within 0.1 nm .",
    "the radiative decay rate @xmath137 mhz can be inferred from @xmath138 and from an accurate calculation of the oscillator strength of the atomic transition @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath130 is found to be @xmath139 atomic units , within a relative uncertainty of @xmath140 .",
    "we next consider the relativistic part of the hamiltonian , @xmath141 , which is diagonal in the hund s case ( c ) basis ( by definition of hund s case ( c ) , see e.g. @xcite ) , with three eigenvalues corresponding to the three states @xmath142 .",
    "the eigenstates can only be characterized by the projection @xmath143 of the total electronic angular momentum ( orbital and spin ) on the molecular axis @xcite . in @xmath3he",
    "the atomic fine structure can be modeled using the following operator : @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the atomic orbital and spin angular momenta .",

    "consequently , the fixed - nuclei approximation must be corrected by an accounting of the coupling between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom .",

    "we will examine these wells more closely in the following discussion .",
    "so far the dynamics of the electrons has been treated independently from the dynamics of the nuclei . in our perturbative model ,",
    "the coupling between the two comes from the kinetic energy operator for the relative motion of the nuclei : @xmath167 in this expression @xmath168 are the spherical coordinates of the fictitious particle of reduced mass @xmath11 associated with the pair of nuclei , and @xmath169 is the orbital angular momentum associated with its rotation .      .",

    "the operator to be diagonalized becomes : @xmath170 now , the space of states has to be extended to the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "only the total angular momentum @xmath171 has to be conserved , and @xmath146 represent the _ molecular _ orbital and spin angular momenta .",
    "] so we must consider the set of states @xmath172 defined by the product of electronic states determined above @xmath173 and of rotational states @xmath174 @xcite : @xmath175 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath176 is the projection of @xmath177 onto a lab - fixed frame . since the molecule is linear",
    ", @xmath169 is orthogonal to the molecular axis , which means @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "thus the electronic quantum number @xmath143 represents the projection of @xmath177 onto the molecular axis and it is recalled as a parameter in the notation for the rotational state . in this basis , @xmath169 can be written as @xmath180 , the square of which is given by : @xmath181    in equation ( [ eq : detail l2 ] ) , the first line contains terms that couple electronic states with each other _ inside _ each @xmath182 block .",
    "the second line contains the terms that couple states belonging to different @xmath143 subspaces , due to the action of @xmath183 which obeys _ anomalous _ commutation rules @xcite and couples @xmath143 to @xmath184 .",
    "these off - diagonal coupling terms become important where potential curves belonging to different @xmath143 subspaces cross each other ; they produce anti - crossings .",
    "for the three purely long - range wells of interest , such crossings appear far enough in the classically forbidden region that the off - diagonal coupling terms can be neglected in the calculation of the binding energy .",
    "thus , in the following calculation , only the terms coupling states within a given @xmath143 subspace ( first line in equation ( [ eq : detail l2 ] ) ) are kept in the expression of the rotation of the nuclei .",
    "figure [ fig : effect_of_rotation ] shows the change in the three _ ungerade _ potential wells resulting from the inclusion of the rotation of the nuclei in the hamiltonian .",
    "the minimum possible value for @xmath185 is @xmath186 . for higher values of @xmath185",
    "the contribution of the centrifugal barrier due to the rotation of the nuclei increases .",
    "bose - einstein statistics dictates that @xmath185 should be odd for @xmath1 , and even for @xmath164 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is no restriction on @xmath185 for the @xmath165 state , since it is doubly degenerate .",
    "next , since the electronic states depend on @xmath42 ( figure [ fig : projections_ouplus ] ) , the vibration of the nuclei also influences the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this effect is described by the radial part of the kinetic energy of the nuclei , namely the first term in parenthesis in equation ( [ eq : nuclear_kinetic_energy ] ) .",
    "this final addition to the hamiltonian leads to the following equation : @xmath187 where the eigenstates @xmath188 are written using a basis with separable variables : @xmath189 , with @xmath190 the vibrational part , and @xmath172 the electronic and rotational part . with these notations , @xmath172 are the @xmath42-dependent eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath191 , with the eigenvalues @xmath192 determined previously and given in figure [ fig : effect_of_rotation ] .    because the crossings between electronic potential curves lie far enough in the classically forbidden region , the action of @xmath193 on the electronic part should be considered as a diagonal correction and we neglect the off - diagonal terms of this operator .",
    "this is the so - called adiabatic approximation @xcite , and equation ( [ eq : bound states hamiltonian ] ) reduces to a set of independent radial equations :    @xmath194    where the vibrational part of the wave function has been written @xmath195 , and @xmath196 is the binding energy for the ro - vibrational level @xmath197 in the @xmath198 potential well .",
    "finally , the vibration of the nuclei is described through a single effective potential well which is the sum of @xmath192 ( which already takes into account the rotation of the nuclei ) and of the correction coming form the dependence in @xmath42 of the eigenstates of @xmath191 .",

    "note that the @xmath73 line was probed with a different laser set up , so its measured binding energy is less precise than the others ( see @xcite ) . also , the @xmath201 progression is too weak to be observed in our experiment .",
    "the effect of retardation on the calculated energy is illustrated by the quantity @xmath202 ( table [ tab : comparison ] , column c ) .",
    "it increases the depth of the well , and therefore the binding energies as well .",
    "compared with the non retarded calculation ( @xmath203 in the expressions [ eq:_retarded_dipole_1 ] and [ eq:_retarded_dipole_2 ] ) , retardation is a correction proportional to @xmath204 in relative value , but to @xmath205 in absolute value .",
    "therefore , it becomes very important in relative values for very elongated states ( up to @xmath206 for @xmath200 ) , and it is more important in absolute values for less elongated states ( @xmath207 for @xmath73 ) . given the experimental accuracy of 0.5 mhz , this work is a demonstration of the retardation effect , which has to be taken into account to reproduce the measured binding energies .",
    "this effect has been already demonstrated for sodium atoms in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the correction to the electronic potential due to the vibration of the nuclei is illustrated by the quantity @xmath208 in table [ tab : comparison ] , column ( d ) .",
    "practically @xmath208 is the difference between the binding energy calculated with and without the term @xmath209 in equation ( [ eq : radial equation ] ) .",
    "this term is part of the kinetic energy of the system .",

    "its contribution is non vanishing in the region where the electronic state changes its character with @xmath42 due to the anti - crossings discussed previously , that is to say in the vicinity of the bottom of the potential well .",
    "therefore the correction is stronger for the deepest states , as they do nt extend very far from this region .",

    "[ tab : results ] , the results are given for one relevant value of @xmath185 , taking into account the bose - einstein statistics already mentioned in paragraph [ parag : effect of rotation ] .",
    "the purely long - range character of these molecules arises from the very large distance at which their inner classical turning points lie ( table [ tab : results ] , column b ) .",
    "the outer turning points ( column c ) and mean sizes @xmath213 ( column d ) are also particularly large , leading to an unusual type of  giant \" dimer for which asymptotic calculations allow an accurate description . at such large distances , the next order term @xmath214 in the electromagnetic interaction",

    "@xcite had submitted for publication the result of a multichannel calculation , which is also in very good agreement with our experimental results .",
    "their method is more elaborate and allows for a direct solution of the full set of equations ( [ eq : bound states hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "we have also performed a multi - channel resolution of equation [ eq : bound states hamiltonian ] with the use of a mapped fourier grid method .",
    "our results @xcite are comparable to those of reference @xcite to within 100 khz .",
    "the main reason why the adiabatic approach is efficient and the multi - channel calculation required is that there is no crossing between the adiabatic potential wells of interest and the other potential curves .",
    "this allows for a single - channel calculation that leads to equation [ eq : radial equation ] and is accurate enough to reproduce the experimental spectrum .",
    "in a previous letter @xcite , we reported an accurate measurement of the binding energies of purely long - range helium dimers in the @xmath1 potential well connected to the @xmath162 asymptote .",
    "the present paper reports theoretical calculations which complement the experimental results in order to interpret the spectra measured .",
    "the experiment consists in measuring the pa laser detunings for which a strong heating of the atomic cloud is observed .",
    "the heating is assumed to be a consequence of the resonant excitation of a bound state in the @xmath1 potential well . to infer the corresponding binding energy ,",
    "the measured pa laser detunings must be corrected from a mean shift of the molecular lines due to the non - zero magnetic field @xmath72 at the center of the trap , and also to the non - zero temperature of the cold gas .",
    "since the detunings are measured with high accuracy , a simple calculation shows that the temperature - induced shift must be considered , given the range of temperature explored ( 2 - 30 @xmath11k )",
    ". this calculation does not include the exact shape and width of the lines but only gives in a mean correction .",
    "the binding energies deduced after correction are independant of the density , and no magnetic dipole moment is detectable for the excited state . apart from the symmetric and asymmetric broadening mechanisms discussed in section [ section : shifts ] ,",
    "the lineshapes are actually also influenced by the dynamics of the heating mechanism .",
    "indeed the temperature curves are an indirect measurement of the lineshape which relies on the efficiency of the thermalization of the cloud .",
    "an incomplete thermalization can lead to another source of broadening of the lines , but no additional shift .",
    "the calorimetric detection scheme and its implications on the lineshape will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "here we have presented an approximate solution of the schrdinger equation that is well suited for asymptotically large internuclear distances .",
    "the adiabatic approach allows for accurate calculations of the binding energies in the case of purely long - range potential wells .",
    "the calculation can easily be extended to other purely long - range potential wells which can in principle also be observed in our experimental conditions , namely @xmath164 and @xmath165 .    finally , the comparison between the experimental and theoretical determination of the binding energies in the @xmath1 potential well is very good if retardation effects are taken into account . as a consequence ,",
    "an accurate measurement of the radiative decay rate for the excited atomic state @xmath2 can be inferred .",
    "the accuracy of the experimental data allows for a test of retardation effects as well as of tiny vibration - induced couplings between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom .",
