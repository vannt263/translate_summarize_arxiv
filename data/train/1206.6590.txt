    "statistical physics is decisively contributing to our understanding of ecological processes .",
    "in fact it is providing powerful theoretical tools and innovative steps towards the comprehension and the synthesis of broad empirical evidences on macro - ecological laws and emerging biodiversity patterns @xcite .",
    "one field where statistical physics has been particularly successful is the neutral theory of biodiversity @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the assumption that , within the same trophic level , per  capita vital rates are species - independent .",
    "it offers a unified theoretical framework for ecosystems dynamics by invoking solely basic ecological processes such as birth , death , migration and dispersal limitation @xcite .",
    "exact solutions have been found for several ecologically relevant quantities , such as : the relative species abundance distribution ( rsa ) @xcite ; species spatial patterns and clustering @xcite ; patterns of @xmath1-diversity ( i.e. intra- and inter - species spatial correlation ) @xcite ; species area - relationship ( sar ) @xcite ; and species persistence time distributions @xcite .",
    "these results enabled the theory to be tested contrasting empirical data , and to assess the power of neutral models in predicting ecological patterns in many ecosystems .",
    "let consider a given trophic level ( i.e. plants ) in a local ecosystem .",
    "`` local '' means a community immersed in a larger one , called meta - community , that is considered as infinite in size with respect to the local community ( serving as a reservoir ) .",
    "we assume that each individual in the local community has a natural death rate @xmath2 and birth rate @xmath3 ( linear birth and death rates ) .",
    "moreover , due to speciation or diversification events ( i.e. immigration from an outside region ) new species ( i.e. species not already present in the local community ) enter in the system with rate @xmath4 .",
    "a general formulation of the neutral theory employs the birth - death master equation ( me ) for the abundance dynamics of a species in the ecosystem @xcite .",
    "several exact results are known for birth - death models where the population , @xmath5 , of the local community is strictly conserved and/or the corresponding @xmath4 scales as @xmath5 ( e.g see the infinite alleles model with mutation @xcite or the voter model @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a very well known and studied pattern in ecology is the rsa of the local community , defined as the fraction of species of a given abundance .",
    "it describes key elements of biodiversity , as the frequency of rare species in the ecosystem @xcite .",
    "another important quantity in conservation ecology is species richnesses , the number of different species in the community , independently of their abundance .",
    "analytical solutions for both of these quantities can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , transient solutions for species richness and its @xmath0 points time correlations functions ( i.e. the probability of having @xmath6 species at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 species at time @xmath9 , etc .. ) are not easy to calculate using this approach .",
    "moreover , higher complications comes into play if we want to generalize the dynamics with non linear birth and death rates , i.e. birth and death rates which are not proportional to the population size @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the next section we introduce a coarse grained version of this model which will allow us to deduce in a simpler way novel analytical results about ecosystem biodiversity , where the only input is the species persistence time distribution .",
    "we note that , given the assumption of no interaction among species , no approximation is made to obtain these results , but they are limited to knowing whether a species is present / absent , as opposed to knowing how many individuals there are of that species at a given time .",
    "in particular we obtain close - form analytical results for : the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the number of species in the ecosystem in transient states ; the @xmath10point connected time correlation function ; and the survival probability , @xmath11 , defined as the pdf of time - spans @xmath12 to local extinction for a species randomly sampled among the observed assemblages at a certain given time .",
    "a comparison of analytical predictions with empirical data from a estuarine fishes ecosystem will be carried out .",
    "a set of conclusions closes then the paper .",
    "in the natural / realistic case where the total number of species ( @xmath13 ) and individuals ( @xmath5 ) in the local community is not fixed , we can described the abundance dynamics of the species in the system employing a `` grand - canonical '' formulation of the neutral theory .",
    "in particular , if @xmath14 gives the number of species with @xmath15 individuals , and @xmath16 , then the probability @xmath17 - of having at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 species with one individuals , @xmath20 species with two individuals , and so on - is univocally described once the initial condition @xmath21 is known and the transition rates from @xmath22 to @xmath23 due to birth / death or speciation events are given .",
    "in particular , for @xmath24 with birth rate @xmath25 ( birth event within species of @xmath26 individuals ) we have the transitions @xmath27 , while with death rate @xmath28 ( death of an individual belonging to species with @xmath26 individuals ) we have the transitions @xmath29 .",
    "finally with rate @xmath4 the transition @xmath30 occurs .",
    "we remark that in our framework , the total number of individuals @xmath5 is not fixed and the rate at which new species enters in the system is independent of @xmath5 .    in our grand - canonical formulation",
    ", the stationary solution of the master equation corresponding to @xmath31 can be written as @xmath32 with @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath36 represents the ratio of effective per capita birth and death rate and if @xmath37 it has to be less than 1 in order to avoid demographic explosion . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath38 , then at equilibrium there are no individuals in the community because all species eventually go extinct @xcite .    in our theoretical framework",
    "the rsa is deduced by the first moments of @xmath39 , while species richness is described by the probability of having @xmath40 different species in the community at stationarity , that turn out to be poisson distributed with mean @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the kronecker delta , which is @xmath44 when its argument zero and zero otherwise .    since to maintain a finite local community size",
    ", @xmath36 must be less than one , then each species is eventually doomed to extinction .",
    "we thus can define the persistence time @xmath12 of a species as the time incurred between its emergence in the system ( due to diversification or immigration ) and its extinction @xcite .",
    "in particular , persistence times for a species that undergoes the linear birth - death dynamics presented above , are distributed according to the species persistence time ( spt ) pdf @xcite , @xmath45 ^ 2 e^{d(1-x)t}.\\ ] ] from now on , without loss of generality , we set @xmath46 . from eq .",
    "( [ sptpigolotti ] ) we can express the mean persistence time , a key ecological quantity also known as mean extinction time @xcite , as @xmath47 . finally ,",
    "as expected , the mean number of species at stationarity is related to @xmath48 , through eqs .",
    "( [ ps_neutral ] ) and ( [ sptpigolotti ] ) , by the simple formula @xmath49 .      a coarse - grained view of the grand - canonical formulation of the neutral theory can be described as follows .",
    "each species @xmath50 within the local community emerges at a random time @xmath51 with a rate @xmath4 , that is , the probability a new species emerges in the infinitesimal time interval @xmath52 is @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the probability of having @xmath26 new species in the ecosystem up to time @xmath18 , @xmath54 , is given by ( see appendix a ) : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number species at time @xmath57 , i.e @xmath58 .",
    "then the newcomer species @xmath50 persists for a random duration @xmath59 where the random variables @xmath59 are independent and identically distributed with a given pdf @xmath60 .",
    "therefore species arrive as a poisson process ( with rate @xmath4 ) , and then depart after some non - poissonian waiting time @xmath61 .",

    "this approach enable us to go beyond eq .",
    "( [ ps_neutral ] ) , and to generalize these results also for general birth and death rates , by taking different functional shape of the spt pdf .",
    "we remark that the mapping is exact only with respect to the grand - canonical formulation of the neutral theory , while , as we will show , is only a good approximation of the classic birth - death me approach in the limit of large local community ( @xmath5 fixed and @xmath62 ) .    within our framework ,",
    "the number of persistent species in the ecosystem at a given time @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) is given by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of new species that entered into the system in the time interval @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
