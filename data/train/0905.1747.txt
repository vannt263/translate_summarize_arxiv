    "it has a flux density of @xmath2 25@xmath32 mjy and a deconvolved size of @xmath7 ( 28 au ) , leading to a true brightness temperature and thus a dust temperature @xmath19 25 k. assuming that the emission is optically thin with a dust temperature of 25 k , it has a mass of 1.5@xmath24 or @xmath33 , with @xmath26 ranging from 0 to 1 .",

    "] , and thus it may trace a small - scale rotating envelope - disk around smm1 .",
    "the center of rotation seems shifted slightly away from smm1 to the southwest in the direction of smm2 , judging from the peak positions of the redshifted and blueshifted emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcop]b ) .",
    "since the blueshifted emission is brighter than the redshifted emission , the emission peak in the integrated map is shifted further to the southwest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcop]a ) .",
    "emission is also seen extending @xmath2 ( @xmath2 200 au ) to the southeast and northwest around the jet axis , perpendicular to the flattened condensation .",
    "this extended structure seems to rotate in the same direction as the flattened condensation , with the blueshifted emission in the southwest and the redshifted emission in the northeast ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcop]b ) .",
    "the redshifted emission is much weaker than the blueshifted emission and even disappears in the northwest , probably because this region is deeply embedded in a cold envelope that is expected to be collapsing , so that most of the redshifted emission is self - absorbed @xcite .",
    "the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram cut across the flattened condensation along the equatorial plane shows that the redshifted emission indeed is to the northeast and the blueshifted emission is to the southwest of smm1 with the velocity increasing toward smm1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvhcop]a ) , as expected for a rotating envelope - disk around smm1 .",
    "this envelope - disk is clearly seen in the redshifted emission at @xmath21 w.r.t .",
    "the systemic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcop]c ) , where it is not confused with the structure extended along the jet axis .",
    "judging from the peak positions in the pv diagram at the highest velocities at @xmath2 @xmath31.5 w.r.t .",
    "the systemic , the center of rotation indeed seems shifted slightly to the southwest of smm1 , as suggested in figure [ fig : hcop]b . assuming that the shift of the center is @xmath2 , the velocity structure can be roughly fitted with a keplerian rotation with a central mass of @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath2 50 jupiter mass ) .",
    "this mass is consistent with that derived from an evolution model by @xcite , which was found to be 0.06 .",
    "therefore , the condensation may trace a rotationally supported disk .",
    "this disk seems to be truncated around smm2 with a radius of @xmath2 80 au ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hcop]a & [ fig : pvhcop]a ) .",
    "the compact continuum source smm1 may trace the inner part of this disk .",
    "note that , since the velocity can be fitted as well by a rotation law with @xmath36 , this condensation could also trace the inner part of a non - rotationally supported flattened envelope ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can not determine which rotation law can better fit our observations .",
    "the structure extended to the southeast and northwest along the jet axis perpendicular to the flattened condensation may have an outflow motion along the jet axis , in addition to the rotation motion around the jet axis . the blueshifted part of this structure is bright and thus can be used to check this possibility , with a pv diagram cut parallel to the jet axis ( as indicated in fig . [",
    "fig : hcop]b ) .",
    "this blueshifted part has a base in the flattened condensation at @xmath2 in the southwest of smm1 , which has a rotation velocity of @xmath2 @xmath251.2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hcop]a )",
    ". its emission is shifted by this rotation velocity at the base ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvhcop]b ) , as expected if it is rotating around the jet axis like the flattened condensation , as suggested in figure [ fig : hcop]b . in addition , w.r.t . that at the base , its emission is mainly slightly blueshifted ( by @xmath2 @xmath250.2 ) in the southeast and redshifted ( by @xmath2 0.2 ) in the northwest , indicating that it also has an outflow motion along the jet axis , with the approaching side in the southeast and the receding side in the northwest , as seen for the jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : siojet ] ) .",
    "the projected outflow velocity , with a mean value of @xmath2 0.2 , is small compared to the rotation velocity because the outflow is almost in the plane of the sky .",
    "as seen in @xcite , the sio jet consists of a chain of paired knots on either side of the source and it has a mean jet axis at p.a . of 116.1@xmath37 and 297.1@xmath37 , respectively , for the eastern and western components ( fig . [",
    "fig : siojet ] ) . at high resolution ,",
    "the innermost pair of knots , bk1 and rk1 , are now seen as two linear curvy structures on either side of the source , connecting to the continuum emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : siojet]d ) .",
    "knot bk1 extends to @xmath2 ( 84 au ) to the source with a faint emission overlapping with the continuum emission extended to the east ( fig .",
    "[ fig : siojet]d ) .",
    "knot rk1 extends to @xmath2 ( 140 au ) to the source and points to the continuum emission extended to the west .",
    "these two knots are very narrow with a deconvolved size ( i.e. , transverse width ) of @xmath7 ( @xmath2 40 au ) and seem to consist of @xmath2 4 smaller sub - knots as indicated by the emission peaks .",
    "they are curved in the same direction , first slightly to the south , then to the north , and then to the south ( fig . [ fig : siojet]d ) .",
    "this is the so - called  c - shaped bending \" and it could be due to an orbital motion of the source in a binary system @xcite .",
    "note that the jet may also be slightly precessing , since the continuum emission extended along the jet axis is not exactly aligned with the jet axis . that the two knots , bk1 and rk1 , do not bend exactly at the same distance further supports this possibility .",
    "however , the dominant effect must be the  c - shaped bending \" , as the jet has an axial symmetry ( bending ) , not a point symmetry ( precession ) .",
    "knots bk2 , bk3 , rk3 , and likely also rk2 , which are located further away from the source , are now seen as head - tail structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : siojet]c ) .",
    "the head structures are due to the sideways ejection of the internal shocks and grow bigger further away .",
    "the trailing tails may trace the ( weakly shocked ) material in the jet beam .",
    "knots bk4 to bk6 and rk4 to rk7 trace the internal ( bow ) shocks further downstream ( fig .",
    "[ fig : siojet]b ) .",
    "proper motion of the sio jet can be estimated by comparing the peak positions of the knots here with those seen at @xmath2 3.6 yrs earlier in @xcite .",
    "we first convolved our maps here to the resolution of those obtained earlier and then aligned the maps with the continuum peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pmjet ] ) .",
    "in addition , we only measure for those knots that actually consist of one single ( sub-)knot .",
    "they are knots bk2 , bk3 , bk4 , bk6 , rk4 , and rk7 .",
    "the proper motion is estimated to be @xmath2 @xmath3 per year , resulting in a transverse velocity of @xmath3860 for the jet .",
    "a pv diagram of the sio emission cut along the jet axis is used to study the kinematics of the jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvjet ] ) .",
    "the jet has a mean radial velocity of @xmath256 and 28 lsr ( or @xmath39 and 18.8 w.r.t .",
    "the systemic ) for the eastern and western components , respectively .",
    "these mean radial velocities , combined with the transverse velocity of the jet , result in an inclination of @xmath2 @xmath255@xmath32 and 6@xmath32 to the plane of the sky for the eastern and western components , respectively , and a jet velocity of @xmath2 170@xmath360 .    in knot rk1 , four tiny sub - knots with a separation of @xmath2 ( 210 au ) are seen with a range of velocities .",
    "although it is not that clear , similar number of sub - knots may form in knot bk1 as well .",
    "the velocity range is the broadest at the first sub - knot with a fwzm of @xmath2 30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specsio ] ) , and it decreases with the distance from the source .",
    "as mentioned , knots bk2 , bk3 , rk3 , and likely also rk2 all show a head - tail structure in morphology ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : siojet]c ) .",
    "the mean velocity of their tails is higher than that of their heads ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvjet ] ) , suggesting that the jet material in the tails will eventually go into the heads .",
    "the heads of knots bk2 and bk3 are better resolved longitudinally , and their velocity is seen decreasing with the distance toward the downstream , suggesting that they are formed as the fast jet material catches up with the slow jet material .",
    "this is expected if they are the internal shocks produced by a semi - periodical variation in the jet velocity , like the knots in the iras 04166 + 2706 jet @xcite . on the other hand , knot rk4 , which is further away , shows a velocity increasing with the distance toward the downstream .",
    "this change of velocity gradient at a larger distance is also expected because of thermal expansion of the internal shock along the jet axis ( see fig . 8 in * ? ? ?",
    "we present in figure [ fig : pvrot ] the pv diagrams cut across the jet axis centered at the peaks of knots bk1 , bk2 , bk3 , rk1 , rk2 , and rk3 , in order to follow up our previous study of jet rotation at higher spatial and velocity resolutions . in @xcite ,",
    "the beam was @xmath11 in size and elongated with a high inclination ( @xmath2 45 ) to the jet axis .",
    "the velocity resolution was binned to 1.0 per channel . here",
    "the beam is @xmath2 3 - 4 times smaller with a size of @xmath11 and less elongated with a smaller inclination ( @xmath2 30 ) to the jet axis .",
    "the velocity resolution is @xmath2 3 times better , binned to 0.35 per channel .",
    "as expected , the transverse width of the knots increases from bk1 to bk3 and from rk1 to rk3 , due to sideways ejection of the internal shocks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvrot ] ) . unlike",
    "that seen in @xcite , no clear velocity gradient is seen across these knots . previously , the knots were not resolved and the apparent gradient could result from a velocity gradient originally along the jet axis , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "similar apparent gradient is also seen in the pv diagrams derived from our channel maps degraded to the low spatial and velocity resolutions of @xcite .",
    "the apparent gradient seen in @xcite was uncertain and here we show that it was misleading .    in order to further search for jet rotation , we zoom into the innermost pair of knots , bk1 and rk1 , at the highest available resolution of @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvrot_h ] ) . here",
    "we focus only on the innermost pair of knots because the knots further downstream are more affected by the sideways ejection and jet precession ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pvrot ] ) . the pv structures are now better resolved and can be separated into two components , one blueshifted and one redshifted , with respect to @xmath2 -6.5",
    "km / s for knot bk1 and @xmath2 29.1 km / s for knot rk1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvrot_h ] ) .",
    "these two velocities are close to the mean velocities of the jet and can be considered as the velocity centroids of the two knots . for knot rk1 ,",
    "it is clear that the redshifted component is mainly in the northeast and the blueshifted component is mainly in the southwest , similar to that seen in the envelope - disk . for knot bk1",
    ", the two components also show these position offsets at low velocity shifts , even though they extend to opposite sides at high - velocity shifts .",
    "the velocity structures are complicated and could be due to sideways ejection or jet rotation or both . since sideways ejection is mainly perpendicular to the jet axis , the velocity shifts due to sideways ejection are expected to be insignificant at the jet edges ( i.e. , boundaries ) . thus , jet rotation is better measured with the velocity shifts at the two jet edges around the velocity centroid , which can be given by the two peaks at ( @xmath257.1 , @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath255.9 , ) for knot bk1 , and ( 28.7 , @xmath25 ) and ( 29.4 , ) for knot rk1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvrot_h ] ) .",
    "the velocity gradients defined by these peaks could be real since the emission at the two velocities that define the gradients are indeed slightly on the opposite sides of the jet axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rotmap ] ) .",
    "the mean velocity gradient , with a velocity of @xmath2 0.5 at @xmath2 10 au ( ) , if arising from jet rotation , would result in a mean angular momentum of @xmath2 5 au . since a small - scale jet precession could introduce velocity shifts that mimic jet rotation @xcite and the position shifts between the two peaks that define the gradients are less than one third of the synthesized beam , this mean velocity gradient could only be considered as an upper limit of the true gradient due to jet rotation .      with lower transition lines of sio",
    ", the kinetic temperature of the sio emission has been estimated to be @xmath19 300 - 500 k for the innermost pair of knots @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , these knots are spatially unresolved in the direction perpendicular to the jet axis with a deconvolved size @xmath7 . since their brightness temperature has a peak of @xmath2 100 k at @xmath11 resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specsio ] ) , their true brightness temperature could have a peak close to their kinetic temperature .",
    "therefore , the sio emission could be optically thick as in the case of hh 212 @xcite . assuming that the sio emission has a kinetic temperature of 500 k and is optically thin , and that the sio abundance relative to molecular hydrogen is @xmath40 @xcite , the density toward these knots is 10@xmath41 .",
    "note that for the optically thick case , the density is expected to be close to the critical density of sio j=8 - 7 transition , which is @xmath2 10@xmath42 .",
    "since smm1 is seen with a condensation that can be explained with a keplerian disk , the protostar at the peak of smm1 may indeed currently have a mass of only @xmath2 50 , which is a mass of a brown dwarf .",
    "the disk accretion rate can be estimated assuming that the bolometric luminosity @xmath43 is mainly from the accretion . with @xmath44 , a stellar mass of @xmath45 50 , and a stellar radius of @xmath46 @xcite , the accretion rate @xmath47 .",
    "if the accretion rate was the same in the past , this protostar has an accretion age of only @xmath2 @xmath48 yrs . if this protostar continues to accrete mass at this rate from the envelope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont]a ) that has a mass of @xmath2 50 @xcite , it will start burning hydrogen in @xmath49 yrs .",
    "this protostar , if indeed with such a low mass at such a young age , could be the lowest mass , youngest source known to have a rotating disk , a high - speed collimated jet , and a collimated outflow . among the youngest low luminosity objects known to date very few are clearly in the class 0 stage and driving ( high - speed ) collimated outflows , with possibly iram 04191 @xcite and iras 04166 + 2706 @xcite being the most remarkable cases . however , neither iram 04191 nor iras 04166 + 2706 have been reported to have a rotating structure at the disk scale ( @xmath4 100 au ) .",
    "other brown dwarf candidates associated with disks ( inferred from the spectral energy distribution ) and driving outflows are all in more evolved evolutionary stages ( class i / ii / iii ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the hh 211 system , revealing a substellar object ( at the moment ) with a rotating envelope - disk in the class 0 phase and driving a spectacular outflow suggests that brown dwarfs and low mass stars form in a similar way , and that whether they will become low - mass stars or brown dwarfs depends on the amount of material that can be accreted still in the envelope .",
    "the nature of the continuum source smm2 is uncertain .",
    "it may trace an asymmetry in the inner envelope around smm1 .",
    "it may also trace a dusty envelope - disk around another embedded source .",
    "that the envelope - disk seems to have a center of rotation shifted slightly away from smm1 to the southwest in the direction of smm2 and that the envelope - disk seems to be truncated around smm2 both support this possibility . the center of mass in the system , if assumed to be the same as the center of rotation , is @xmath2 in the southwest of smm1 ( see  [ sec : hcop ] ) and thus @xmath2 in the northeast of smm2 .",
    "thus , the embedded source , if existed , would have a mass of @xmath2 8 ( a mass lower than that of a brown dwarf ) , with the protostar in smm1 now having a mass of @xmath2 42 .",
    "therefore , it would be a small binary companion surrounded by a dusty envelope - disk of 1.5@xmath254 ( see  [ sec : cont ] ) .",
    "further submillimeter observations are needed to confirm this .",
    "the small mass of this companion may explain why there is no clear evidence of an outflow associated with smm2 .",
    "this companion would have an orbital period of @xmath2 3000 yrs and could be responsible for the large - scale precession of the jet @xcite .",
    "this binary companion , however , may not be responsible for the c - shaped bending that seems to have a much shorter period .",
    "we speculate that the hh211 system may eventually evolve into a binary system consisting of a very low - mass star and a brown dwarf .",
    "the structure extending @xmath2 ( @xmath2 200 au ) to the southeast and northwest around the sio jet seems to have an outflow motion along the jet axis , in addition to the rotation motion around the jet axis .",
    "it is seen within a wide - opening cavity with the western walls traced by the western extensions in the continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont]a ) and is thus different from the large - scale molecular outflow driven by the fast - moving jet and wind @xcite . assuming that it has the same inclination as the jet , it has a deprojected outflow velocity of @xmath2 2.1 , about 1.8 times the rotation velocity at the base of the outflow , which is @xmath50 ( fig .",

    "thus , it can be considered as a low - speed outflow . with a size of @xmath2 200 au",

    "similar low - speed outflow has also been seen along the jet axis in other class 0 sources , e.g. , iram 04191 @xcite and hh 212 @xcite in , and even in class ii sources , e.g. , rno 91 @xcite and cb 26 @xcite in co. like the hh 211 outflow , the hh 212 and cb 26 outflows may also be rotating . in the case of cb 26 , the outflow may arise from the disk and play a significant role in dispersing the disk material in the late stage of star formation @xcite . here in the case of hh 211 ( and probably also hh 212 ) ,",
    "the outflow may arise from the envelope - disk .",
    "it has a mean specific angular momentum of @xmath2 50 au , with @xmath2 1.2 at @xmath2 45 au ( ) , and may carry away part of the extra angular momentum , if not all , allowing material to fall toward the center in the early phase of star formation . with an outflow velocity to rotation velocity ratio of @xmath2 2 ,",
    "the low - speed outflow could be driven by magneto - centrifugal force as that seen in from the rotating structures , such as the outer part of the disk @xcite or the inner part of the pseudodisk ( a non - rotationally supported flattened envelope ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sio emission is absent near the source , but suddenly appears at @xmath2 in knots rk1 and bk1 and peaks at @xmath2 at their first sub - knots . as mentioned , these knots likely consist of about 4 sub - knots separated by with a velocity range decreasing with the distance from the source .",
    "near the source , this decrease in velocity range with the distance is expected if the sub - knots trace the internal shocks produced by a semi - periodical variation in the jet velocity [ for the detailed velocity structures produced by such variation , see e.g. , fig . 2 in @xcite or fig . 8 in @xcite ] .",
    "if this is the case , a sub - knot is expected to be seen closer in at @xmath2 from the source .",
    "indeed , the sio emission is seen extending all the way to @xmath2 .",
    "no such sub - knot ( emission peak ) is seen there probably because the shock there has just started to develop and is too weak to produce an emission peak .",
    "thus , the sio emission of the innermost pair of knots seems closely related to the shock enhancement of sio in gas phase .",
    "sio abundance can be greatly enhanced in the shocks as a consequence of grain sputtering or grain - grain collisions releasing si - bearing material into the gas phase , which reacts rapidly with o - bearing species ( e.g. , o@xmath51 and oh ) to form sio @xcite .",
    "this shock enhancement mechanism , which requires a flow time @xmath19 100 yrs @xcite , seems too slow to explain the sio emission of the innermost pair of knots , which have a dynamical time @xmath7 30 yrs with a jet velocity of @xmath2 170 , as in hh 212 @xcite . for the innermost sio emission at @xmath2 ( 140 au ) from the source ,",
    "the dynamical time is only @xmath2 4 yrs . therefore , at least for the innermost sio emission , it is possible that sio was already formed on dust grain and then released in gas phase in the shocks @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the decrease in velocity range with the distance for the innermost pair of knots is explained in the context of a x - wind model , in which the jet is actually a dense part of a wide - angle _ radial _ wind @xcite . for a simple comparison",
    ", we can assume the jet has a constant transverse size of @xmath2 , then the velocity range is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the distance of the jet from the source .",
    "therefore , the velocity range is expected to be @xmath2 26 at and @xmath2 9 at , roughly similar to that seen in the pv diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvjet ] ) . in this case",
    ", sio of gas phase could have formed in the jet due to high gas density in the jet @xcite , with a mass - loss rate @xmath2 @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to study its production rate in order to explain why the sio emission is not seen all the way to the source .",
    "as mentioned , the mean velocity gradient seen across the jet axis toward the innermost pair of knots could be considered as an upper limit of the true gradient due to jet rotation . if this is the case , assuming that the sio jet is a dense part of a magnetized wind launched from an accretion disk by magneto - centrifugal force , we can estimate the upper limit of the launching radius of the jet . with a central mass of @xmath2 50 ,",
    "a jet velocity of @xmath2 170 , and a rotation velocity of @xmath2 0.5 at @xmath2 10 au , the upper limit of the launching radius is estimated to be @xmath2 0.014 au ( @xmath2 3 @xmath55 ) , following @xcite . at this radius ,",
    "the keplerian velocity is @xmath2 54 , resulting in a jet velocity to keplerian velocity ratio of @xmath2 3 , close to that expected for a wind launched by magneto - centrifugal force ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "velocity gradients have also been seen in another class 0 source hh 212 across the jet axis toward its innermost pair of sio knots , sn and ss , and may arise from jet rotation as well @xcite .",
    "since knot sn is closer to the source and less affected by sideways ejection , its velocity gradient , with @xmath2 0.5 at @xmath2 50 au , can be considered as an upper limit of the true gradient due to jet rotation .",
    "since the mass of the central protostar is @xmath2 0.15 @xcite , the jet velocity is expected to be higher than that of hh 211 and can be assumed to be 200 .",
    "thus , the upper limit of the launching radius of the sio jet is found to be @xmath2 0.05 au for the hh 212 system . at this radius ,",
    "the keplerian velocity is @xmath2 52 , resulting in a jet velocity to keplerian velocity ratio of @xmath2 3.8 , also close to that expected for a wind launched by magneto - centrifugal force .    as a result ,",
    "if the velocity gradients are really due to jet rotation , the sio jets of the two class 0 sources could be a part of a magnetized wind launched at @xmath2 0.014 - 0.05 au from the source , much closer than that of the outflow , which seems to have an outflow base at the flattened envelope - disk .",
    "they could be launched from the innermost edge of the disk near the corotation radius , as predicted in the x - wind model @xcite .",
    "they may carry away excess angular momentum from the inner edge of the disk , allowing material to fall on to the protostar .",
    "note that , however , since the velocity gradients could only be considered as upper limits of the true gradients due to jet rotation , the jets could have no rotation and different launching mechanism .",
    "further observations at higher angular resolution are really needed to check this possibility .",
    "we have mapped the hh 211 protostellar system in 352 ghz continuum , sio ( @xmath0 ) , and ( @xmath1 ) emission at up to @xmath2 resolution with the sma .",
    "the main conclusions are the following :    1 .",
    "the continuum source is now resolved into two sources , smm1 and smm2 , with a separation of @xmath2 84 au .",
    "smm1 is seen at the center of the jet , probably tracing a ( inner ) dusty disk around the protostar driving the jet .",
    "its mass is estimated to be @xmath2 13 .",
    "smm2 is seen to the southwest of smm1 and may trace a 1.54 envelope - disk around a small binary companion .",
    "2 .   a flattened envelope - disk is seen in around smm1 perpendicular to the jet axis , with a radius of @xmath2 80 au .",
    "its velocity structure is consistent with a rotation motion and can be fitted with a keplerian law that yields a central mass of @xmath2 50@xmath315 .",
    "note that its velocity structure can also be fitted as well with a rotation law @xmath56 .",
    "3 .   if the flattened envelope - disk is indeed in keplerian rotation , then the protostar that drives the jet could have a mass of @xmath2 50@xmath315 .",
    "thus , the protostar could be the lowest mass source known to have a collimated jet and a rotating flattened envelope - disk .",
    "4 .   a small - scale ( @xmath2",
    "200 au ) low - speed ( @xmath2 2 ) outflow is seen in around the jet axis extended from the envelope - disk .",
    "it seems to rotate in the same direction as the envelope - disk with a mean specific angular momentum of @xmath2 50 au , and thus may carry away part of the angular momentum from the envelope - disk .",
    "the jet is seen in sio originating from smm1 .",
    "the innermost pair of knots are now seen with a ",
    "c - shaped \" bending and each consisting of @xmath2 4 smaller sub - knots .",
    "they are very narrow , with a transverse width of @xmath4 40 au . knots further downstream have a head - tail structure , with the head likely resulting from sideways ejection of the internal shocks and the tails tracing the weakly shocked material in the jet beam .",
    "the kinematics associated with most of the head - tail knots is consistent with the fast jet material in the tails catching up with the slower material in the heads .",
    "the knots likely result from the internal shocks produced by a semi - periodical variation in the jet velocity .",
    "we measure the proper motion of the sio knots by comparing the data between 2008 and 2004 , and obtain a transverse velocity of 170@xmath360 .",
    "the jet , with an inclination of @xmath2 5 to the plane of the sky , has a velocity the same as the transverse velocity .",
    "the sio associated with the innermost pair of knots could not be formed by grain - sputtering or grain - grain collisions that release si into the gas phase .",
    "we suggest that the sio could form directly on the grain surfaces and be released to the gas phase in the shocks .",
    "a possible velocity gradient is seen consistently across the innermost pair of sio knots , consistent with the rotation sense of the envelope - disk and the large - scale ammonia envelope .",
    "if this gradient , with @xmath2 0.5 at @xmath2 10 au , is an upper limit of the true rotational gradient of the jet , then the jet carries away a very small amount of angular momentum of @xmath4 5 au and thus must be launched from the very inner edge of the disk , as predicted in the x - wind model .",
    "further observations at higher resolution are really needed to confirm if this gradient is really due to jet rotation .",
    "we thank the sma staff for their efforts in running and maintaining the array , and the anonymous referee for the precious comments .",
