    "while a considerable amount has been learned during the past five years @xcite @xcite about the ricci flow of three dimensional riemannian geometries , and while this knowledge has been used very successfully to study the relationship between topology and geometry @xcite , there are still many unanswered questions regarding the details of three dimensional ricci flow , especially concerning flows which develop singularities .",
    "one of these questions concerns the circumstances and the details of the formation of singularities of type ii .",
    "the type ii singularities are characterized by the condition that , if the singularity occurs at a finite time @xmath1 , then the quantity @xmath2 blows up as @xmath3 approaches @xmath1 ; this behavior contrasts with that of type i singularities , for which this same quantity is uniformly bounded .",
    "it is believed that the standard neck pinch singularities , which according to hamilton s scenario @xcite play a major role in three dimensional ricci flow dynamics , are type i. the work of angenent and knopf @xcite supports this contention , and describes some of the detailed asymptotic behavior of standard neck pinch singularities , at least in the rotationally symmetric case .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite , it has been demonstrated numerically @xcite , and it has now been proven @xcite , that type ii singularities occur during the course of a ricci flow which uses a `` critical geometry '' for initial data . to obtain a critical geometry in the sense we mean here , one considers a one - parameter family of ( initial data ) riemannian metrics on @xmath0 , with the volume - normalized ricci flow developing standard neck pinch singularities for low values of the parameter , and with singularities avoided for those flows which start from geometries with high values of the parameter .",
    "the critical geometry then corresponds to the transitional ( boundary ) value of the parameter .",
    "our earlier work @xcite , in which we have numerically simulated the ricci flow of critical geometries , uses families of geometries which are all rotationally symmetric and also reflection symmetric across the equator .",
    "the geometries are all `` corsetted spheres '' , with the parameter measuring the degree of corsetting relative to a round sphere . for tight corsetting ( small parameter )",
    "the ricci flow develops a standard neck pinch singularity , as described in @xcite . for",
    "loose corsetting , the flow approaches the round sphere . in @xcite",
    ", we numerically simulate the ricci flow of both tightly and loosely corsetted geometries , and we are then able to focus on the transitional critical geometry , and examine its flow .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the ricci flow of the critical geometry seen in our simulations is quite different from that which we see starting at geometries with non critical values of the parameter .",
    "the curvature concentrates at the poles ( recall our assumption of reflection symmetry ) , and overall the geometry approaches that of a `` javelin '' : it becomes increasingly cylindrical everywhere except at the poles , where the curvature blows up . in analogy with similar behavior seen for critical",
    "mean curvature flows , this has been labeled a  degenerate neck pinch \" .    in our earlier work",
    ", we did not closely explore the details of the ricci flow for our critical geometries at the poles .",
    "we noted the curvature blow up , but nothing further .",
    "here , we focus on the flow at the poles , and we verify that , as has been conjectured , the flow in the neighborhood of the poles is very accurately modelled locally by the flow of the bryant steady soliton @xcite ; see also chapter 1 of @xcite .",
    "the bryant steady soliton is the unique ( up to scaling ) rotationally symmetric ricci gradient soliton on @xmath4 which neither shrinks nor expands .",
    "that is , the metric @xmath5 on @xmath4 is rotationally symmetric about a fixed point on @xmath4 , taking the form @xmath6 for the round metric @xmath7 on @xmath8 and for a positive function @xmath9 ; and it satisfies the steady ricci gradient soliton equation @xmath10 for a function @xmath11 .    if one substitutes into equation ( [ ricsol ] ) the metric @xmath5 of the form ( [ rotsymmetric ] ) together with a rotationally symmetric function @xmath12 , one obtains a coupled system of ordinary differential equations , to be solved for @xmath9 and @xmath12 . in @xcite ,",
    "( see also chapter 1 of @xcite ) this ode system is written out and analyzed , it is shown that there is a unique solution ( up to homothety ) , and the profile of this solution ( obtained by numerical integration ) is exhibited .",
    "we use this profile in our model matching here .",
    "( see section 4 . )",
    "one of the key features of a steady ricci soliton @xmath13 is that the ricci flow of the soliton metric @xmath5 fixes @xmath5 up to a time - dependent diffeomorphism ( generated by the vector field @xmath14 .",
    "hence the curvature is time independent .",
    "the sense in which such a flow can model the singularity developing at the pole of our degenerate neck pinch is in terms of the blow up ( rescaling ) of that singularity . specifically , given a ricci flow solution @xmath15",
    "which is going singular at the point @xmath16 at time @xmath1 , let us define the `` blow up '' metrics @xmath17 by setting @xmath18 where the function @xmath19 is chosen so that all the rescaled metrics @xmath20 have the same value of @xmath21 at the point @xmath16 .",
    "the singularity is then modeled by the soliton if , for spatial points near @xmath16 and for @xmath3 approaching @xmath1 , the blow up metrics @xmath22 approach closer and closer to the soliton metric .",
    "we provide strong numerical evidence here that for the degenerate neck pinch solutions which we study here , the geometry at the poles is indeed modelled by bryant steady solitons in this sense .    since , in any family of initial geometries , it is difficult to precisely find the critical initial geometry which flows ( via ricci flow ) to a degenerate neck pinch , for our numerical studies we have chosen to carry out a slightly different comparison as well : we consider a sequence of initial geometries @xmath23 which are all sub critical ( loose corsetting ) and which approach the critical geometry .",
    "since these are sub critical , each of their flows evolve toward a time @xmath24 ( different for each one ) at which the curvature at the poles reaches a maximum , after which their flows dissipate the curvature .",
    "so one alternative way to test the bryant steady soliton modelling conjecture is to evolve each of the @xmath23 geometries up to its time of maximum curvature @xmath24 and then compare the geometry near the pole of @xmath25 with the bryant steady soliton , scaled to have the same maximum geometry as @xmath25 .",
    "our numerical work indicates that this comparison too matches very well .",
    "when our initial work @xcite on the numerical simulation of the ricci flow of degenerate neck pinches was carried out , it had not been shown mathematically that type ii singularities do develop during ricci flow .",
    "this has now been shown by gu and zhu @xcite .",
    "their work does not , however , tell us any of the details of such ricci flows .",
    "our work here indicates what those details should be .",
    "one hopes that a proof of this behavior will be forthcoming .",
    "the types of metrics considered are the same as in @xcite .",
    "we have spherically symmetric metrics on @xmath0 which take the form @xmath26 .",
    "\\right ) \\label{metric}\\ ] ] the corseted sphere geometries that we use for initial data have @xmath27 with @xmath28 determined intrinsically by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant that determines the amount of corsetting .",
    "in particular @xmath31 corresponds to two round three spheres joined at the poles , while for positive @xmath32 this cusp is smoothed out .    to ensure that the evolution is well behaved numerically , we evolve using the volume - normalized deturck flow @xcite @xmath33 here the spatial constant @xmath34 is the volume average of the scalar curvature , and the vector field @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the connection of the metric @xmath38 while @xmath39 is the connection of a round three sphere . this evolution equation for the metric @xmath5 , together with the form of @xmath5 in ( [ metric ] ) , yields partial differential equations for the metric quantities @xmath28 and @xmath40",
    "however , we find that it is more convenient to use @xmath28 and the quantity @xmath41 .",
    "the reason for this is that smoothness of the metric requires that @xmath40 vanish at the poles of the three sphere at the rate of @xmath42 and this condition is automatically enforced by smoothness of @xmath43 .",

    "we then approximate @xmath61 by @xmath62 . since at any given time step we know @xmath54 and want to solve for @xmath63 the simplest thing to do is to apply @xmath64 at time step @xmath65 , which yields the finite difference equation @xmath66 which has the solution @xmath67",
    "this is the method used in the work described in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this method is quite slow for the following reason : as is typical for parabolic equations , stability of the numerical method requires a time step @xmath57 that is of order @xmath68 .",
    "this means that it becomes extremely slow to run simulations with high resolution . for this reason",
    " limitations in resolution  we were able in @xcite to show the existence of a critical solution , but we were not able to examine that critical solution accurately enough to characterize it . to obtain the needed level of accuracy without sacrificing efficiency , we need a faster numerical method  one that does not have such a limitted time step .",
    "one way to overcome the limitation on the time step is to apply the operator @xmath64 at time step @xmath69 rather than time step @xmath65 .",

    "during the course of ricci flow , the curvature becomes large and then diminishes , with the maximum of the curvature occuring at the poles .",

    "it is clear from this figure that as the initial data gets closer to the critical data , the maximum curvature occurring during the corresponding flow gets larger .",
    "this suggests that to get the best view ( via numerical simulation ) of the critical solution , one should examine the evolving metric at the time for which the curvature of a slightly subcritical solution is at its maximum .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we follow two approaches here to see if the behavior of the critical solution at the poles is modeled accurately by the bryant steady soliton . before carrying either of them through",
    ", we need a numerical simulation of the metric for this soliton . to obtain this",
    ", we first substitute a metric of the form ( [ rotsymmetric ] ) into the ricci soliton equation ( [ ricsol ] ) , and we are led to the following ode system    @xmath83     plot of scalar curvature at the pole _ vs _ time for three different values of @xmath32 ]    where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath85 .",
    "since this is a system of second order odes for two functions , one might expect a four parameter family of solutions .",
    "however , equations ( [ brysol1])-([brysol2 ] ) are invariant under the addition of a constant to @xmath11 and smoothness of the solution at the origin imposes additional constraints . in the end",
    ", the general smooth solution is determined by a single parameter @xmath86 which appears in the series expansions for @xmath87 and @xmath88 around the origin as follows @xmath89 where the dots @xmath90 stand for higher order terms . however , even this degree of freedom is to a certain extent misleading .",
    "it is only for negative @xmath86 that nonsingular solutions exist for @xmath91 and solutions with different negative values of @xmath86 differ only in an overall constant scale factor in the metric .",
    "thus up to scale , there is really only one bryant steady soliton .",
    "the relation between the overall scale and the parameter @xmath86 is reflected in the expression @xmath92 for the scalar curvature at the origin .    to develop the bryant steady soliton using ( [ brysol1 ] ) and ( [ brysol2 ] ) , we first choose @xmath86 ( the choice depending on the desired scale ; see below ) and use it to express the expansion forms for @xmath87 and @xmath88 in a neighborhood of the origin , following ( [ powera ] ) and ( [ powerf ] ) .",
    "we then numerically integrate the rest of the way using the fourth order runge - kutta method.@xcite    for a spherically symmetric metric , the ricci tensor has two independent eigenvalues : @xmath93 the eigenvalue in the directions tangent to the symmetry @xmath8 and @xmath94 the eigenvalue in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry @xmath8 . for both our ricci flow simulations and for our numerical integration of the bryant soliton odes , we calculate these ricci eigenvalues and compare them .    for one of our comparison studies ,",
    "we compare the geometry of appropriately scaled bryant steady soliton solutions with the geometries near the poles at the time of maximum curvature for a sequence of subcritical initial geometries approaching the critical solution . here",
    ", we choose the parameter @xmath86 so that the curvature at the tip of the soliton matches that at the poles of the flows for the sub critical geometries ( at maximum curvature ) . figure ( [ r1compare ] ) gives the @xmath94 eigenvalue for the ricci flow simulation at the time of maximum curvature ( solid line ) and for the bryant soliton ( dashed line ) .",
    "these quantities are plotted as functions of radial distance .",
    "figure ( [ r2compare ] ) makes the same comparison for the @xmath93 eigenvalue .",
    "note that in both cases there is an excellent match between the ricci flow simulation and the bryant soliton .",
    "@xmath94 as a function of radial length for a near critical solution at the time of maximum curvature ( solid line ) and for the bryant soliton ( dashed line ) ]    @xmath93 as a function of radial length for a near critical solution at the time of maximum curvature ( solid line ) and for the bryant soliton ( dashed line ) ]    for our other study , we choose a subcritical initial metric which is very close to the critical geometry , and consider a sequence of times approaching the time of maximum curvature at the pole . at each time",
    ", we calculate the blow up geometry as specified in equation [ blowup ] .",
    "we scale the blowups , and scale the soliton , so that they all have identical curvature at the poles .",
    "the results are graphed in figure ( [ rperpscale ] ) for @xmath95 and in figure ( [ rs2scale ] ) for @xmath93 .",

    "we see that the blowup geometries approach agreement with the bryant steady soliton at somewhat early times and retain this agreement for times beyond the time of maximum curvature .",
    "this agreement ( in a neighborhood of the pole ) becomes remarkably close .",
    "thus both of our tests strongly support the conjecture that the bryant steady soliton accurately models the pole behavior of the ricci flow of critical geometries which develop degenerate singularities .",
    "since for each one parameter family of initial geometries one expects degenerate pinches to occur for just a single value of the parameter , direct numerical testing of the behavior of degenerate neck pinches is essentially impossible .",
    "our numerical studies here do , however , strongly support the contention that degenerate neck pinches are modeled very accurately by the bryant steady soliton , at least in the case of rotationally symmetric geometries .",
    "the natural next step for thse studies is to consider one paramter families of geometries which are _ not _ rotationally symmetric .",
    "numerical simulation of the ricci flow for such metrics is expected to be considerably more challenging , and likely will require working on multiple overlapping patches on @xmath0 . carrying out these simulations , however , should allow us to explore whether the ricci flows of non rotationally symmetric geometries tend to evolve toward rotationally symmetric geometries , both in the case of neck pinch singularity formation , and degenerate neck pinch singularity formation .",
    "once numerical evidence for a particular behavior in solutions of a pde system has been obtained , there is strong motivation to mathematically prove that the behavior is present .",
    "as noted above , the existence of type ii singularities in the ricci flows of critical type geometries has now been proven @xcite . however , the features of these singularities , including the formation of javelin geometries and the modeling by bryant steady solitons , remains mathematically unverified .",
    "this should be a promising direction for future research .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grant phy-0456655 to oakland university and both phy-0354659 and phy-0652903 to the university of oregon .",
