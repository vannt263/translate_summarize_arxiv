    "therefore one can study the fluctuations of the left - hand side via the right - hand side , and vice versa .",
    "several forms of this assertion are proved in section  [ s : detcor ] , for example , in the case of the limiting shape @xmath43 we have :    let @xmath24 be probability measures , and let @xmath44 be the corresponding continual diagrams .",

    "the study of fluctuations of diagrams was initiated by a theorem , proved by kerov @xcite in the 1990-s , which describes the fluctuations of a ( plancherel ) random young diagram about the limiting shape .",

    "ivanov and olshanski also described the fluctuations of the transition measure @xmath26 associated with @xmath23 ( see [ tran ] ) : @xmath61    as observed in @xcite , ( [ eq : clt_io ] ) bears a similarity to johansson s central limit theorem @xcite for the gaussian unitary ensemble : @xmath62 ( see [ kerov_clt ] ) .",
    "this raises the question what is the analogue of kerov s central limit theorem ( [ eq : clt_kerov ] ) in random matrix context .",
    "recently , this question was studied by erds and schrder @xcite .",

    ", the result of @xcite asserts that the fluctuations of the diagram corresponding to the eigenvalues of @xmath29 and of its principal submatrix are described by @xmath64 where the argument of the arcsine is truncated at @xmath65 ( see further [ lp ] and [ lp2ors ] ) .",
    "parallel results for jacobi @xmath66-ensembles were obtained by gorin and zhang in @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ eq : es ] ) does not look similar to ( [ eq : clt_kerov ] ) , for two reasons .",
    "first , a typical random partition of @xmath67 has @xmath68 rows , therefore the normalisation @xmath69 in ( [ eq : es ] ) would correspond to @xmath70{n}$ ] , rather than @xmath69 , in ( [ eq : clt_kerov ] ) .",
    "second , the gaussian process in ( [ eq : es ] ) has a continuous modification ( it is roughly a reparametrised brownian motion ) , whereas the sum in ( [ eq : clt_kerov ] ) does not even converge in @xmath71 .",
    "these differences are natural in view of the markov correspondence .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ s : mc ] above , the markov transform takes the left - hand side of ( [ eq : es ] ) to the spectral measure @xmath26 ( see [ wig1 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the latter were studied , in the context of gaussian ensembles , by lytova and pastur @xcite ; for the gue , their result ( see [ lp ] ) asserts that @xmath72 as noted in @xcite , the larger scale @xmath69 reflects the gaussian fluctuations of the eigenvectors of the random matrix .",
    "the result ( [ eq : lp ] ) was extended to other wigner matrices by the same authors @xcite and by pizzo  renfrew ",
    "soshnikov @xcite ; in this more general setting , the limiting process may change , and is not necessarily gaussian ( see [ lp2ors ] ) .    in [ lp ] , we feed ( [ eq : lp ] ) into the markov correspondence and obtain a version of ( [ eq : es ] ) , albeit in much weaker topology than @xcite . more general wigner matrices are considered in [ lp2ors ] .",
    "( vice versa , it may be possible to deduce a strengthened version of the central limit theorems in @xcite from the result of erds  schrder @xcite in its full strength and generality ; we do not pursue this direction here .. ] )    the discussion above raises the expectation that a version of ( [ eq : es ] ) with the critical points @xmath73 in place of the submatrix eigenvalues @xmath35 may bear more similarity to kerov s theorem ( [ eq : clt_kerov ] ) .",
    "indeed , appealing to johansson s central limit theorem ( [ eq : joh_clt ] ) , we show that    for the gaussian unitary ensemble , @xmath74    the precise formulation is given in [ joh ] , a comparison between ( [ eq : es_glob ] ) and ( [ eq : es ] )  in figure  [ fig ] , and a generalisation to other wigner matrices  in [ joh_gen ] .",

    "<S> in a series of works published in the 1990-s , kerov put forth various applications of the circle of ideas centred at the markov moment problem to the limiting shape of random continual diagrams arising in representation theory and spectral theory . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate on several examples that his approach is also adequate to study the fluctuations about the limiting shape .    in the random matrix setting , </S>",
    "<S> we compare two continual diagrams : one is constructed from the eigenvalues of the matrix and the critical points of its characteristic polynomial , whereas the second one is constructed from the eigenvalues of the matrix and those of its principal submatrix . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of the latter diagram were recently studied by erds and schrder ; we discuss the fluctuations of the former , and compare the two limiting processes .    for plancherel random partitions , </S>",
