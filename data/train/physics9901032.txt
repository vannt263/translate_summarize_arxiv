    "the calculation of dielectric quantities by computer experiment requires an explicit consideration of effects associated with the truncation of long - range interactions .",
    "the concrete success in this direction has been achieved within the reaction field ( rf ) geometry [ 15 ] . as a result ,",
    "computer adapted dielectric theories have been proposed [ 610 ] . in the framework of these theories , a bulk dielectric constant",
    "can be determined on the basis of a fluctuation formula via correlations obtained in simulations for finite samples .",
    "however , main attention in the previous investigations has been focused on polar systems with the point dipole interaction .",
    "as is now well established , the model of point dipoles can not reproduce adequately features of real polar liquids .    at the same time , attempts to apply the rf geometry for more realistic interaction site ( is ) models have also been made [ 1113 ] .",
    "however , acting within a semiphenomenological approach , it was not understood how to perform the truncation of intermolecular potentials . as a consequence , the molecular cut - off and the usual point dipole rf ( pdrf ) have been assumed .",
    "obviously , such an approach includes effects connected with finiteness of the molecule inconsistently .",
    "indeed , the interdipolar potential is replaced by site - site coulomb interactions , whereas the rf is remained in its usual form .",
    "an additional complication for is models consists in a spatial distribution of charges and this fact is not taken into account by the standard pdrf geometry .    in the present paper",
    "we propose two alternative approaches to remedy this situation .",
    "the first one follows from the usual fluctuation formula which is constructed , however , on the microscopic operator of polarization density for is models .",
    "this leads to an isrf geometry , where the cut - off radius is applied with respect to individual charges rather than to the molecule as a whole .",
    "nevertheless , the molecular cut - off scheme can also be acceptable , but the reaction field together with the fluctuation formula need to be corrected . in the second approach a molecular rf ( mrf ) geometry is proposed and a new quadrupole term is identified .",
    "on the basis of a mcy water model we show that uncertainties of the dielectric quantities can be significant if the standard pdrf geometry is used in computer simulations .",
    "we consider an isotropic , classical system of @xmath0 identical molecules enclosed in volume @xmath1 .",
    "the microscopic electrostatic field created by the molecules at point @xmath2 is equal to @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the position for charge @xmath5 of @xmath6th molecule , @xmath7 is the microscopic operator of charge density , @xmath8 and the summation extends over all molecules and charged sites . for the investigation of dielectric properties , it is more convenient to rewrite the electric field ( 1 ) in the polarization representation @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the dipole - dipole tensor , @xmath11 denotes the microscopic operator of polarization density , defined as @xmath12 , and the singularity @xmath13 has been avoided , where @xmath14 is the unit tensor of the second rank . the both charge ( 1 ) and polarization ( 2 )",
    "representations are equivalent and applicable for infinite ( @xmath15 ) systems .    in simulations , which deal with finite samples , the sum ( 1 ) can not be calculated exactly taking into account an infinitely large number of terms .",
    "therefore , we must restrict ourselves to a finite set of terms in ( 1 ) or to a finite range of the integration in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for which @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a cut - off radius . now the following problem appears . how to estimate the cut - off field caused by the integration over unaccessible region @xmath18 ?",
    "the solution of this problem has been found for the first time for systems with point dipoles in the rf geometry .",
    "the result for conducting boundary conditions is [ 7 , 8 ] @xmath19 where a cubic finite sample and toroidal boundary conditions ( tbc ) have been used , so that @xmath20{v}/2 $ ] .",
    "the additional term @xmath21 in the right - hand site of ( 3 ) describes the rf which is used for an approximation of the real cut - off field . for a pure spherical cut - off ( sc ) without the rf correction , we have @xmath22 , where @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise . obviously , that @xmath26",

    "it is easy to see from ( 6 ) that the both functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 tend to the same value @xmath42 of the infinite system at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "however , the results converge as @xmath45 for the pure sc scheme , while as @xmath46 in the rf geometry , i.e. , more quickly , because a main part of the truncation effects is taken into account by the rf .",
    "this is very important in our case , where we hope to reproduce features of infinite systems on the basis of finite samples .",
    "that is why the pure truncation , which is standard for simple fluids with short - range potentials , is generally not recommended for polar systems with long - range nature of the dipolar interaction .",
    "the influence of the tbc and the difference between micro- and canonical ensembles are of order @xmath47 [ 14 ] and , therefore , they can be excluded from our consideration .",
    "it is worth mentioning that electrostatic fields are pure longitudinal .",
    "they can be defined via the longitudinal component of the microscopic operator of polarization density , that is confirmed by eq .",
    "let us enclose the system in an external electrostatic field @xmath48 .",
    "the material relation between the macroscopic polarization @xmath49 in the weak external field and total macroscopic field is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the longitudinal wavevector - dependent dielectric constant .",
    "applying the first - order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath52 yields for rigid molecules @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are boltzmann s constant and temperature , respectively , and @xmath56 is the equilibrium average in the absence of the external field .",
    "then , taking into account that @xmath57 and eliminating @xmath58 , we obtain the fluctuation formula @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the longitudinal component of the finite - system wavevector - dependent kirkwood factor , @xmath61 and @xmath62 denotes the permanent magnitude of molecule s dipole moment .",
    "it is necessary to note that we consider rigid is molecules so that effects associated with molecular and electronic polarizabilities are not included in our investigation . in the case of @xmath43",
    ", we have @xmath63 and computer adapted formula ( 7 ) reduces to the well - known fluctuation formula for macroscopic systems in terms of the infinite - system kirkwood factor @xmath64 .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , the electric field @xmath65 in the form ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) as well as the fluctuation formula ( 7 ) have been proposed for the first time to investigate polar systems of point dipoles [ 8 ] . however , acting within a semiphenomenological framework , it was not understood how to perform the truncation of the intermolecular potential @xmath66 at attempts to extend this formula for is models . as a result , the molecular cut - off @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the center of mass for @xmath6th molecule , and the usual pdrf have been suggested [ 1113 ] : @xmath69\\ ] ]    it is essentially to emphasize that the fluctuation formula ( 7 ) takes into account finiteness of the system explicitly by the factor @xmath70 . as a result ,",
    "if the system size is sufficiently large ( terms of order @xmath46 can be neglected ) , the bulk ( @xmath71 ) dielectric constant can be reproduced via the finite - system kirkwood factor @xmath72 which depends on @xmath17 in a characteristic way .",
    "however , to achieve this self - consistency in the evaluation of the bulk dielectric constant , the equilibrium averaging in @xmath72 must be calculated for systems with the intermolecular potential which leads exactly to the microscopic electric field @xmath73 ( 3 ) .",
    "as we shall below , the intermolecular potential ( 8) does not obey this condition .    to derive the exact intermolecular potential in the charge representation , we perform the inverse fourier transform @xmath74 and obtain using ( 6 ) @xmath75 taking into account that @xmath76 if @xmath77 and is equal to @xmath78 if @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 otherwise , where the first term in the right - hand side is the coulomb field , while the second contribution corresponds to the rf in the is description .    in order to understand nature of this field",
    ", we consider a spherical cavity of radius @xmath17 with the center at point @xmath82 , embedded in an infinite conducting medium .",
    "let us place a point charge @xmath5 at point @xmath4 in the cavity , so that @xmath83 .",
    "the total electric field @xmath84 at point @xmath82 consists of the field due to the charge @xmath5 and the field created by induced charges located on the surface of the cavity . according to the method of electrostatic images [ 5 ] ,",
    "this last field can be presented as the field of an imaginary charge @xmath85 which is located at point @xmath86 that is completely in line with the term of sum ( 10 ) .    in the potential representation ( @xmath87 ) , we obtain @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is , in general , an arbitrary constant which for infinite systems is chosen as @xmath92 . in our case , according to the toroidal boundary conventional , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 0 \\ ! & , & \\ \\",

    "it is easily seen from ( 11 ) that the isrf part @xmath95 transforms into the usual form @xmath96 of point dipoles for @xmath97 only , where @xmath98 is the diameter of the molecule and @xmath99 . in the case",
    "if the molecular rather than the site - site cut - off is applied to the potential ( 11 ) , this transformation is valid for arbitrary @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , in the last case the constant @xmath101 is canceled owing electroneutrality ( @xmath102 ) of the molecule and we recover the result ( 8) of previous work [ 11 ] .",
    "however , the potential of interaction ( 11 ) corresponds completely to the conditions at which the fluctuation formula ( 7 ) is derived .",
    "therefore , this potential , instead of ( 8) , must be used in simulations to obtain a correct value for the dielectric constant .",
    "in the case of point dipoles , where @xmath103 , @xmath104 provided @xmath105 , both ( 8) and ( 11 ) representations are identical and reduced to the well - known result @xmath106\\ ] ] for the interdipolar interaction in the rf geometry .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case of is models , the intermolecular potential ( 8) takes into account effects associated with finiteness of the molecule inconsistently .",
    "for example , the interdipolar potential is replaced by the real site - site coulomb ones , whereas the reaction field is remained in its usual form of point dipoles . from this point of view a natural question of how to improve the rf within the molecular cut - off scheme arises . the simplest way to solve this problem lies in the following .",
    "let us consider the mentioned above spherical cavity , centered now at some fixed point @xmath107 , in the infinite conducting medium .",
    "we place an @xmath6th molecule in such a way that all sites of the molecule would be located in the cavity .",
    "this condition is fulfilled providing @xmath108 .",
    "the potential of a molecular reaction field at point @xmath82 belonging the cavity can be presented , according to the method of electrostatic images , as @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 . differentiating ( 13 ) over @xmath82 at point @xmath112 yields @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the dipole moment of @xmath6th molecule , which does not depend on @xmath107 owing electroneutrality of the molecule , while @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the tensors of quadrupole and octupole moments , correspondingly , of @xmath6th molecule with respect to @xmath107 .",
    "the third rank tensor @xmath116 has the following components @xmath117 .",
    "it is more convenient to present multipoles of higher order with respect to the molecular center of mass . for the tensor of quadrupole moment we obtain @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the tensor of quadrupole moment of @xmath6th molecule with respect to its center of mass , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is necessary to underline that tensor @xmath122 is split into dynamical @xmath123 and conservative @xmath124 parts for rigid molecules .",
    "putting @xmath125 and assuming @xmath126 , we obtain the energy of @xmath127th molecule in the mrf of @xmath6th molecule @xmath128 where multipoles of higher order have been neglected . finally , using the rf potential @xmath129 yields the desired intermolecular potential @xmath130 0 \\ ! & , & \\ \\",

    "\\\\\\ ] ] where equality @xmath131 has been used",
    ".    the total reaction field , created by all molecules at point @xmath82 near @xmath107 is @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 denote the total dipole and own quadrupole moment , respectively , within the sphere of radius @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the case of point dipoles , we have @xmath137 , @xmath138 and the mrf ( 17 ) transforms into @xmath139 .",
    "this last formula shows that the reaction field of finite systems is inhomogeneous even for point dipoles . only for macroscopic ( @xmath140 ) systems , we reproduce the well - known homogeneous reaction field @xmath141 introduced by barker and watts [ 3 ] . for finite is systems , additional higher multipole terms appear .",
    "this brings , for example , into existence of the new quadrupole - dipole and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions in the intermolecular potential ( 16 ) .",
    "we note that the idea of using the higher multipole moments in the rf has been proposed for the first time by friedman [ 5 ] .",
    "however , the modified intermolecular potential ( 16 ) still needs to be complemented by a self - consistent fluctuation formula as this has already been done in the preceding section by the fluctuation formula ( 7 ) for the potential of interaction in the site - site cut - off scheme ( 11 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not a simple matter to construct fluctuation formulas in the molecular cut - off approach .",
    "this problem will be considered in further studying .",
    "the difference in the rf geometry between is and pd models lies in the distinction for their microscopic operators of polarization density . for is models @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the microscopic operator of polarization density for point dipoles and an expansion over small parameter @xmath144 has been made [ 15 ] .",
    "however , putting @xmath145 in the microscopic electric field @xmath41 ( 6 ) at the very beginning and taking attempts to perform the inverse fourier transform , we obtain that the corresponding integral is divergent in @xmath146-space when @xmath147 .",
    "this divergence is involved by the specific nature of point dipoles for which the parameter @xmath144 becomes indeterminate in the limit @xmath148 because of @xmath149 and the expansion ( 18 ) fails .",
    "therefore , we must manipulate with the full operator @xmath150 to obtain the interdipolar potential ( 12 ) consequently and let @xmath149 at the end of the calculation only .",
    "since @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the quadrupole contribution with respect to the dipole term is varied in ( 16 ) from of order @xmath153 at @xmath154 to @xmath155 at @xmath156 . therefore ,",
    "as far as the usual intermolecular potential ( 8) is applied in simulations , the dielectric constant can not be reproduced with the precision better than @xmath157 .",
    "it is evident that using the modified intermolecular potential ( 16 ) will lead to the uncertainties of order @xmath153 .",
    "they decrease at increasing the size of the sample as @xmath46 , i.e. , with the same rate as those connected with the truncation of the potential .",
    "effects of the octupole and higher order multipole contributions into the mrf are of order @xmath158 and can be ignored .",
    "in the previous investigations [ 1113 ] , the standard pdrf geometry ( 8) has been applied to actual simulations of the mcy and tip4p models . as a result ,",
    "the static , frequency - dependent [ 11 , 12 ] and wavevector - dependent [ 13 ] dielectric constant has been determined . for these models @xmath159 and the cut - off radius @xmath160 has been used in the simulations . from the afore",
    "said in the preceding section , it is expected that the precision of these calculations can not exceed @xmath161 .",
    "we shall show now by actual calculations that this prediction indeed takes place .",
    "as an example we apply the isrf geometry ( 11 ) to the mcy potential [ 16 ] .",
    "the calculations have been performed with the help of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , details of which are similar to those reported earlier [ 13 ] , at the density of @xmath162= 1.0 g/@xmath163 and at the temperature of @xmath164 k , i.e. , in the same thermodynamic point and yet with the same number @xmath165 of molecules and cut - off radius    our result of the calculation ( 7 ) for the longitudinal components of the wavevector - dependent infinite - system kirkwood factor @xmath166 and dielectric constant @xmath51 obtained within the isrf geometry is presented in figs .  1 and 2 , respectively",
    ", as the full circles connected by the solid curves . for the purpose of comparison , analogous calculations performed previously [ 13 ] within the pdrf are also included in these figures ( the open circles connected by the dashed curves ) .",
    "it is obvious that oscillations observing in the shape of @xmath167 and @xmath51 obtained within the pdrf method are nonphysical and caused by the finite molecular size which is assumed to be zero in this approach . at the same time",
    ", the isrf geometry gives the true , more smooth dependencies for the kirkwood factor and dielectric constant because the influence of the finite molecular size is included here explicitly .",
    "as we can see from the figures , deviations of values for the wavevector - dependent dielectric quantities obtained using the pdrf from those evaluated within the isrf geometry are significant .",
    "these deviations achieve maximal values about @xmath168 near @xmath169 , where the kirkwood factor has the first maximum . for great wavevector values @xmath170",
    "the both geometries lead to identical results because the influence of boundary conditions is negligible in this range of @xmath171 .",
    "we remark that the wavevector - dependent quantities were calculated directly for the discrete set @xmath172 of grid points accessible in the simulations , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 is an integer number .",
    "these quantities are marked in the figures by the symbols . to obtain intermediate values between the grid points",
    "we have used the cubic spline interpolation for the most smooth dependency , namely , for @xmath166 .",
    "then values of @xmath51 can be evaluated anywhere in the considered domain of @xmath171-space on the basis of the interpolation values of @xmath166 via eq .",
    "7 . in particular ,",
    "the first singularity of @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "2a ) has been investigated in such a way .",
    "two alternative methods ( isrf and mrf ) to overcome the difficulties associated with finiteness of the molecule with respect to the system size have been proposed for is models of polar systems .",
    "it has been shown rigorously that the fluctuation formula , which is commonly used for the calculation of the dielectric constant in computer experiment , corresponds to the isrf geometry with the site - site cut - off for coulomb interaction potentials .",
    "the molecular cut - off scheme leads to the mrf geometry with an additional quadrupole term to the well - known pdrf .",
    "it has been corroborated by actual calculations that the isrf geometry exhibits to be much more efficient with respect to the usual pdrf method for the investigation of the dielectric properties of is models .",
