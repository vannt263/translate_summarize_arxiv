    "blue stragglers are stars coeval with a given stellar population , but positioned blueward and above its main sequence ( ms ) turnoff , thus mimicking a younger population .",
    "they were first observed by @xcite in the globular cluster m3 as an apparent extension of the classical ms ( see for example @xcite for a review on blue stragglers ) . since",
    "globular clusters have traditionally been considered single stellar populations , stars located blueward and above the ms turnoff in its color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) should have evolved out of the ms into a post hydrogen - burning phase . in this context , the existence of blue straggler stars challenges our current understanding of stellar evolution . to inhabit a hotter and more luminous region in the cmd ,",
    "these stars must have increased their original masses and , in the process , renewed their fuel for nuclear reactions .    since the discovery made by sandage , blue stragglers have been found in practically all galactic globular clusters , and several formation mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "early on , blue stragglers as single stars were proposed , either massive young stars due to recent star formation , or stars in a post - helium flash evolutionary phase where hydrogen rich material has sunk to the core @xcite , but these were later discarded . at present , the leading blue straggler star formation mechanisms are stellar mergers produced by direct stellar collisions ( hereafter _ collisional blue stragglers _ ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mass - transfer or mergers in primordial binary or higher order systems ( hereafter _ binary blue stragglers _ , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several studies have shown that some blue stragglers are indeed binary systems , by measuring photometric variability in these stars @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , triples have been claimed to be particularly relevant in blue straggler formation in low density environments @xcite .",
    "triples could form blue stragglers through mechanisms like kozai cycles and tidal friction @xcite or triple evolution dynamical instabilities @xcite .",
    "the importance of collisions involving triple stars in forming blue stragglers was confirmed by @xcite through @xmath3body modeling of the old open cluster ngc  188 .",
    "@xcite argued that both mechanisms ( binary and direct collisions ) are likely to be at work in globular clusters , a view shared by several studies with their relative importance being a function of cluster mass @xcite , dynamical evolution and physical conditions of the environment @xcite .    to investigate the relative importance of the two formation mechanisms ,",
    "several correlations between the observed fraction of blue straggler stars and host properties have been explored .",
    "for example , the fraction of blue stragglers can be plotted as a function of density or encounter rate .",
    "if the fraction of blue stragglers grows with density , then collisions might be the dominant formation mechanism .",
    "if instead we find less blue stragglers in denser systems , collisions between stars might prevent blue straggler formation , either by separating primordial binaries or disrupting multiple star systems .",
    "perhaps the most notable result in this context is the one reported by @xcite , who found that blue straggler specific fraction declines with increasing luminosity or mass .",
    "the interpretation of this anti - correlation is that the current fraction of binary stars , from which blue stragglers would form , would be lower for larger and denser systems @xcite .",
    "although , in the magnitude range spanned by piotto s globular cluster sample , @xmath4 , a significant contribution from collisionally formed blue straggler stars can not be discarded .",
    "in addition to globular clusters , blue stragglers have been detected in a variety of low density environments such as galactic dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , loose stellar clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "currently , the number of studies in dsph galaxies is rather limited , and in most cases they cover one or two galaxies ( see @xcite for draco and ursa minor , @xcite and @xcite for sculptor , and @xcite for sextans ) . only one study to date presents a systematic study among classical dsph galaxies @xcite .",

    "first results from this survey were presented in @xcite , who reported the discovery of a very low luminosity star cluster at a distance of @xmath38kpc along the line of sight to the ursa minor dsph galaxy . from the entire sample of objects in this survey ,",

    "we note that overcrowding affects only a few objects since most outer halo clusters are , on average , more extended and less luminous than their inner halo counterparts , and therefore have lower stellar densities . in the cases",

    "an example is shown in the right panel of figure  [ booi_cmd ] and the values of the inner and outer annuli of the contamination region , in terms of @xmath68 , are shown in table  [ blue straggler star frequencies ] for each object .",
    "once blue stragglers , rgb stars and contamination objects were selected , we defined the specific fraction of blue stragglers as : @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 mean ` blue straggler star ' and ` red giant branch star ' and @xmath73 and @xmath74 mean , respectively , ` system ' and ` contamination ' .",

    "each time we ran a simulation , we shifted the data by values consistent with the uncertainties in the measured frequencies and then calculated the set of fitting parameters that corresponded to that shifted data sample .",
    "then , for each fitting parameter , the uncertainty was determined as the standard deviation of the values obtained in the different runs .",
    "this result is consistent with a similar anti - correlation found by @xcite for a group of @xmath81 globular clusters , most of them in the inner halo , but in our study we have expanded the anti - correlation to clusters that are three magnitudes fainter . even though we used rgb stars as a normalization population and",
    "hb stars were used in @xcite , the slopes of the anti - correlations found in both studies are consistent within the errors .    a different normalization method ( first outlined in @xcite )",
    "was also used to illustrate the dependence of blue straggler population sizes on the total population size of their hosts . as seen in figure  [ number_mass ] , we correlated the number of blue stragglers observed with the total _ stellar _ mass of our systems .",

    "[ average_freq_dwarfs ] and [ number_mass_dwarfs ] point to specific blue straggler fractions in dwarfs that are either independent of the absolute magnitude or that follow a shallow anti - correlation with absolute magnitude like the one found by @xcite .    finally , we plot blue straggler specific frequencies against both the density within @xmath68 ( see figure  [ freq_density ] ) and the encounter rate between single - single stars ( see figure  [ freq_gamma ] ) , as calculated in @xcite .",

    "we studied the numbers and magnitude distributions of stars inhabiting the region of the cmd occupied by blue stragglers .",
    "based on these values , we estimate the ages and fractions of young stars that would reproduce our observations in the absence of genuine blue stragglers . in this way",
    ", we can assess the likelihood that recent bursts of star formation could be responsible for the stars observed beyond the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "given the extremely low number of stars present in our dwarf galaxies , the only region of the cmd that we can use to compare blue stragglers and young stars is the region previously defined as our blue straggler box , since all the other regions of the cmd would show negligible number of blue stragglers and/or young stars compared to the main old population or contamination stars ( see figure  [ sim_cmd ] for an example of the expected appearance of the cmd of an object where young stars could reproduce the number and distribution of stars observed beyond the main - sequence turnoff in our dwarf galaxies ) .    to estimate the properties of the young stars that could reproduce the blue straggler frequencies observed in our galaxies , we ran simulations where we generated both a young and an old single stellar population . to generate them , we used two padova isochrones : a young one with an age varying from @xmath86 to @xmath87gyr and an old one of @xmath63gyr , both with an abundance of [ fe / h]@xmath88 which represents the average among the galaxy sample .",

    "additionally , we constrained the age of young stars that could mimic blue stragglers by comparing the magnitude distribution of each set of young stars with those of the observed blue stragglers .",

    "we carried out a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to compare the different sets of stars , and found that stars with ages of @xmath0gyr were the only ones even marginally consistent with the magnitude distribution of the observed blue stragglers in our dwarf galaxies .",
    "the magnitude distributions of blue stragglers in globular clusters are also consistent with the one of @xmath93gyr old stars and blue stragglers from dwarf galaxies .",
    "this result comes as no surprise . for populations older than @xmath94gyr",
    ", turnoff stars leave what we defined as our blue straggler box progressively closer to its faint end while younger populations will extend beyond the upper luminosity limit observed for blue straggler , both in clusters and in galaxies .    what is left to determine is the fraction of stars with ages in the range of 23gyr that would reproduce the specific fractions of blue stragglers observed in our dwarf galaxies .",
    "figure   [ diff_ages ] shows that to reproduce the lowest observed fraction of blue straggler stars in all dwarf galaxies , a minimum young star fraction of @xmath1@xmath67% is needed .",
    "for the upper limit , the fractions needed are @xmath95@xmath2% for @xmath0gyr old stars .    in summary",
    ", the stars in the region of the cmd occupied by blue stragglers in our dwarf galaxies can be attributed to recent bursts of star formation only if all the dwarf galaxies in our sample formed stars @xmath0gyr ago , and these stars account for @xmath1@xmath2% of the total number of stars , or @xmath1@xmath96% in mass fraction .",
    "furthermore , if we exclude the four systems with the highest blue straggler frequency uncertainties , the fine - tuning of the star formation history of galaxies would have to be even greater to explain blue stragglers , since the young star fraction needed would have to be in the narrow range of @xmath86 to @xmath87 % , which ( as explained in the discussion section ) we deem highly unlikely .",
    "we explored an additional line of evidence to help elucidate the nature of the blue straggler candidates in our galactic satellites : we compared their radial distributions to those of rgb and ms stars .",
    "how blue stragglers are distributed throughout a system can be the result of a complex interplay between dynamical history and the dominant blue straggler formation mechanism . in our dwarf galaxy sample collisions",
    "are negligible and @xmath67-body relaxation times are longer than the age of the universe and therefore dynamical evolution ( mass segregation ) is not expected . in this scenario , there is no reason to presume central concentration of blue stragglers .",
    "young stars , on the other hand tend to be centrally concentrated with respect to other stellar populations in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus the radial distribution of the stars we classified as blue stragglers can help us distinguish genuine blue stragglers from young stars . in the case of the globular clusters in our sample , where we can assume a priori that blue stragglers are genuine",
    ", eventual central concentration could shed some light into the relevance of collisions as a formation mechanism .",
    "for most satellites in our sample , we found that the radial distribution of blue stragglers is nearly indistinguishable from that of rgb stars .",
    "significant differences are seen only in @xmath97 of our systems .",
    "these objects are : the ufds canes venatici  i and ursa major  ii and the globular clusters palomar  4 , palomar  13 , palomar  15 and eridanus .",
    "figure  [ diff_raddist ] shows the blue straggler fraction versus radius , normalized by the overall fraction of blue stragglers , for these six objects .",
    "it is interesting that for canes venatici i and ursa major ii , blue straggler stars are located preferentially in the outer regions .",
    "this behavior is also observed in galaxies like draco , although for this galaxy the difference is too small for the ks test to differentiate both radial distributions . for the globular clusters in the figure ,",
    "a clear radial concentration is observed ( except for eridanus , where a bimodal distribution might be present ) .",
    "it is worth reminding the reader that the area we used to select blue stragglers corresponds to twice the half - light radii of the systems , and therefore features in the radial distribution present at larger distances will not be observed if the objects extend much further than this .",
    "however , we do not anticipate this to be a problem given the extremely low densities at radii larger than @xmath98 .",
    "in both classical and ufd galaxies , blue stragglers are ubiquitous , regardless of how low the stellar densities or encounter rates are .",
    "their specific frequencies are high compared to those observed in globular clusters and are found to be statistically consistent with being constant over a six magnitude range . given that we found the rgb populations to scale linearly with luminous mass , this is equivalent to saying that the number of blue stragglers grows almost linearly with the total stellar mass of the system .",
    "we used simulations of young populations to compare their photometric properties with those of the blue stragglers observed in dwarf galaxies and conclude that the latter are genuine , as opposed to young stars .",
    "a number of facts support this conclusion : ( 1 ) for young stars to have magnitude distributions statistically consistent with the blue stragglers observed in dwarf galaxies , their ages need to be closely clumped around @xmath93gyr .",
    "this result can be readily understood when we consider that our brightest blue stragglers have an absolute magnitude of @xmath99 , coincident with the magnitude at which a @xmath93gyr old star evolves out of our blue straggler star box .",
    "this is also the magnitude corresponding to a star with twice the mass of a turnoff star @xmath63 to @xmath100 gyr old , an expected result if we are seeing blue stragglers formed by collisions ( either single - single or in binaries ) or mass - transfer in binary systems .",
    "( 2 ) the magnitude distributions of blue stragglers in both dwarf galaxies and globular clusters ( where they can be reliably classified as blue stragglers ) are completely consistent .",
    "( 3 ) the lack of central concentration of blue stragglers in dwarf galaxies is consistent with the scenario wherein these stars form from mass - transfer or mergers in primordial binaries or multiple systems , rather than being the result of a recent star formation episode . in the latter case the young stars",
    "would be expected to be located preferentially near the central regions .",
    "( 4 ) from the simulations we also determined that to reproduce the range of observed blue straggler frequencies , the @xmath0gyr old stars should constitute @xmath86@xmath2% of the total number of stars in all the dwarf galaxies in our sample , an unlikely fine - tuned common star formation history .",
    "most galaxies in our sample have half - light densities of @xmath101@xmath102stars pc@xmath103 , i.e. , at least @xmath104 times less dense than the solar neighborhood @xcite",
    ". given these extremely low stellar densities , blue stragglers formed by collisions between stars can be safely ruled out .",
    "when considering collisions between single , binaries or triple stars , the collision times ( calculated as in @xcite ) are orders of magnitude higher than the age of the universe .",
    "even though some physical processes have been particularly successful in explaining collisions in low density environments , they might not explain the blue stragglers observed in systems like our dwarf galaxies .",
    "for instance , the triple evolution dynamical instability proposed by @xcite produces encounter rates which are too low in systems with low numbers of stars to explain our dwarf galaxy blue stragglers .",
    "if collisions of any kind can not account for blue stragglers in our systems , their presence can only be explained if they formed via mass - transfer and/or mergers in primordial binaries , whether or not they have more companion stars that are members of the system .",
    "two powerful correlations were found to support this claim .",
    "when plotting blue straggler fractions against both density and encounter rate , we found that a single exponential function could reproduce the behavior of all satellites in our sample . in this context , dwarf galaxies live in the lower density / encounter rate regime , displaying high and similar values of blue straggler fractions .",
    "this points to the fact that collisions neither significantly create nor prevent the formation of their blue stragglers . on the other hand , as we explain below , close encounters in higher density environments prevent blue straggler formation by altering the configuration of the binary or multiple systems .",
    "finally , the lack of central concentration of blue stragglers in all our dwarf galaxies is also consistent with the binary / multiple system scenario , implying that these stars can be formed in all regions of our galaxies and not just their slightly higher density central regions .",
    "the similarity in the blue straggler fractions observed in galaxies can be explained if the primordial binary star fractions are also similar . while this should be further confirmed by observations , hints that this is in fact the case already exist ( @xcite measured the binary fraction of two ultra faint galaxies , finding identical binary fraction values of @xmath105% ) .",
    "our observations show that , for the globular clusters in our survey , the specific frequency of blue stragglers decreases when there is an increase in a particular physical parameter of the host system , such as luminosity , stellar densities , encounter rate and total stellar mass .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath106 and the luminosity of the systems is similar to the one observed for inner halo clusters , even though our globular clusters are on average less luminous and larger ( @xmath107@xmath108 ) .",
    "the slope of our anti - correlation is consistent within the uncertainties with the one found by @xcite using a sample of @xmath81 globular clusters with @xmath109 , and by @xcite , which extends the results of piotto et al .",
    "results with lower luminosity clusters down to @xmath110 .",
    "the anti - correlation derived in our study extends the existing ones to absolute magnitudes as faint as @xmath111 . at this faint end ,",
    "the fraction of blue straggler stars in our globular clusters is comparable to that of dwarf galaxies . despite the consistency between our correlations ,",
    "there is a key difference between our results and the one by @xcite : we study blue stragglers within @xmath112 of our clusters , which represents a significant fraction of the total cluster area , whereas piotto s work focused on the cluster s cores .",
    "this difference is important since , as proposed by @xcite , the systems with the higher relaxation times / higher mass would not have had time to sunk their blue stragglers to the innermost regions by two - body relaxation .",
    "this would reduce the number of blue stragglers , @xmath113 , found in the high mass clusters when counting them in the most central regions , but that would not affect the trend of @xmath113 when the region of the cluster considered represents a considerable fraction of the total cluster area .",
    "thus , if dynamics in the central regions do not destroy the progenitors of blue stragglers and these stars are homogeneously formed within the clusters , mass segregation would translate to a sublinear dependence of @xmath113 with cluster mass enclosed when studying only the central regions whereas a linear dependence would be expected when considering larger areas .",
    "our figure  [ number_mass ] then argues against mass segregation playing an important role in the blue straggler counts in our globulars .    as was the case for dwarf galaxies ,",
    "collisions alone are unable to explain the fraction of blue stragglers observed in our globular clusters . based on the collision times , calculated as in @xcite",
    ", collisions between single , binary or triple systems can account only for a small contribution to the blue straggler numbers observed in our highest density clusters .",
    "thus , there should be another dominant blue straggler formation mechanism at work .",
    "figures  [ freq_density ] and  [ freq_gamma ] show that globular clusters inhabit our higher density , higher encounter rate regime , showing a systematic decrease with both physical parameters .",
    "we interpret these trends as supporting a scenario where mass - transfer or mergers in binary or multiple star systems are the dominant blue straggler formation mechanism in the outer halo globular clusters .",
    "the following pieces of evidence support this scenario : ( 1 ) the behavior of the frequency of blue stragglers is well fitted by single trends with smooth transitions between dwarf galaxies and clusters , which points to a common origin for their blue stragglers .",
    "( 2 ) systematic decrease of blue straggler fraction with encounter rate and density is inconsistent with the collision scenario . instead",
    ", this points to encounters preventing blue straggler formation in our globular clusters . ( 3 ) the expressions shown in equations  [ eq : freq_density ] and [ eq : freq_gamma ] describing the exponential decay of the frequency of blue stragglers with both density and encounter rate arises naturally if the relative decrease in the fraction of blue stragglers goes as the ratio between the age of the system and the collision time .",
    "it is worth pointing out that collisional blue stragglers might have shorter lifetimes than systems formed through mass - transfer @xcite .",
    "this means that we can not rule out the possibility that a fraction of blue stragglers in denser systems still formed through collisions involving binaries ( that would have otherwise undergone mass - transfer to form a blue straggler ) and that they quickly evolved away from the blue straggler region .",
    "we argue that this would be only a second order effect , because the differences in the lifetimes of blue stragglers produced by the different mechanisms is much less than the one needed to explain the decline in the frequency of blue stragglers observed for our clusters .    aside from our study , there is mounting evidence favoring a binary origin for blue stragglers .",
    "a direct link between blue straggler stars and binaries has been determined by @xcite , who derived a binary fraction of @xmath114% among their metal - poor field blue straggler stars , and @xcite who estimated a binary fraction of @xmath115% among blue straggler stars in ngc 188 .",
    "palomar  13 , one of the clusters with the highest blue straggler frequencies is known to have a relatively high fraction of binary stars , @xmath116% @xcite , and many of their blue straggler stars were proved to show significant velocity variations , suggesting these are unresolved binary systems @xcite .    in our globular cluster sample ,",
    "the radial distributions of blue stragglers are in most cases indistinguishable from those of rgb or ms stars , consistent in principle with the binary scenario . however , a clear central concentration of blue stragglers is observed in a few clusters : palomar  4 , palomar  13 and palomar  15 , while a bimodal distribution might be present in eridanus . at first glance",
    ", this may seem contradictory with our interpretation of figure  [ freq_density ] that higher density environments favor the destruction or separation of binary or multiple systems progenitors of blue stragglers , but the trend of frequency with density followed by different objects should not necessarily be expected to hold within a _ single _ system .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of binaries in dense stellar systems and found an increase with time of the core binary fraction , which could be understood as a consequence of a complex interaction between mass segregation of binaries into the core , and their subsequent destruction there .",
    "in addition , once formed , blue stragglers can also migrate toward the central regions through mass segregation . in summary , dynamical processes likely to occur in globular clusters severely complicate the interpretation of the trends observed within an individual object .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive analysis of the blue straggler star population in a representative sub - sample of galactic outer halo satellites .",
    "this photometrically homogeneous sample includes ten low density globular clusters , three classical dsph galaxies and nine of the recently discovered ufd galaxies . despite their diverse physical properties , all these satellites are relatively loose and scarcely populated when compared to inner halo globular clusters , where most blue straggler star studies have been carried out .",
    "given the extremely long collision times of our systems , collisions involving single , binary or triple stars can only account for a small fraction of the blue stragglers of our highest density clusters , while their influence on dwarf galaxies should be negligible .",
    "our sample provided an opportunity to study blue straggler populations in a new density / luminosity regime .",
    "we claim that the dominant blue straggler formation mechanism in these type of systems is mass - transfer or mergers in binary or multiple star systems . in the higher encounter rate regime spanned by our globular clusters ,",
    "encounters prevent blue straggler formation by altering the configuration of the star systems that would otherwise produce blue straggler stars .",
    "the blue straggler populations in both classical dsphs and ufds show a remarkably high and constant distribution of their fractions over an absolute magnitude range of more than six magnitudes , and a density range of two orders of magnitude .",
    "the behavior of the frequency of blue stragglers is well fitted by single trends with smooth transitions between dwarf galaxies and clusters , which points to a common origin for their blue stragglers .",
    "the fraction of blue straggler stars is high and flat in the extremely low encounter rate regime spanned by dwarf galaxies , while it decreases exponentially with increasing stellar density or encounter rate for the regime spanned by our outer halo globular clusters .",
    "there is a well - defined anti - correlation between the fraction of blue straggler stars and absolute magnitude for the outer halo clusters in our sample .",
    "this trend has already been observed in inner halo clusters and it is also interpreted as a consequence of the binary origin of the blue straggler population .",
    "\\6 . comparing the magnitude distribution of the observed blue stragglers in dwarf galaxies with those of simulated single stellar populations",
    ", we find that for blue stragglers in dwarf galaxies to be young stars , they would have to correspond to a @xmath0gyr old population .",
    "in addition , to match the observed blue straggler fractions seen in galaxies , young stars would have to comprise between @xmath1@xmath2% of the total number of stars .",
    "such fine - tuned requirements make it unlikely that we are mistakenly classifying young stars as blue stragglers .",
    "the radial distribution of blue stragglers in most objects is statistically consistent with the ones found for their rgb and ms stars .",
    "only a few exceptions are found , notably the central concentration seen in palomar  4 , palomar  13 , palomar  14 and the bimodal distribution in eridanus . in all these cases , dynamical processes , like mass segregation , are likely to alter the primordial binary population and therefore the interpretation of the trends observed within individual objects is not straightforward .",
