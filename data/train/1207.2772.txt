    "cosmological n - body simulations show that if gravitational interactions between ` standard ' ( i.e. , massive , weakly - interacting ) cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles dominate structure formation , then galaxies must be embedded in dark matter haloes that ( i ) collectively follow a mass function that diverges at low masses as @xmath3 ( e.g. springel et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) ; and ( ii ) individually follow mass - density profiles characterized by centrally - divergent ` cusps ' , with @xmath4 at small radii ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1996 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "the dark matter haloes inferred from observations of real galaxies differ significantly : the estimated mass profiles are consistent with homogeneous - density cores ( kuzio de naray et al .",

    "2010 ; cole et al . 2011 ) can under plausible conditions flatten the central cusps of cdm - like haloes .",
    "likewise , supernova feedback , inefficient cooling of interstellar media , cosmic reionization , uv radiation , and acoustic oscillations have all been invoked to explain the suppression of galaxy formation in low - mass satellite haloes ( e.g. tassis et al .",

    "notice that solutions to cdm problems on small scales rest upon the efficiency with which stars form in dm haloes .",
    "however , while core formation generally requires an efficient conversion of gas into stars , suppression of galaxy formation obviously requires the opposite .    in light of this apparent tension , here we examine whether baryon - physical solutions to cdm s ` core / cusp ' and ` missing satellites ' problems are mutually compatible . for maximal leverage",
    "we consider explicitly the impact of the most energetically efficient baryon - driven events  supernova explosions of type ii ( sneii ) on the least luminous objects associated empirically with dark matter haloes : the milky way ( mw ) s dwarf spheroidal satellites .",
    "we proceed to derive a rough estimate of the amount of work involved in transforming a centrally - divergent cusp into a constant - density core .",
    "we adopt the following cosmologically - motivated halo density profile @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a characteristic halo density and @xmath7 is a scale radius .",
    "we assume that the original state of the dm follows a nfw model , i.e. for a core radius @xmath8 , and that the main effect of baryonic feedback is to flatten the inner cusp , so that at @xmath9 dark matter is homogeneously distributed .",
    "clearly , this solution is not unique , and in principle more complex models ( that is , with a larger number of free parameters ) can be invoked in order to describe the effects of baryonic feedback in more elaborate a detail . in practice , however , eq .",

    "also , one may show that the below estimates barely change for more complex profiles , e.g @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "after the dm cusp is removed we assume that the halo settles in a new equilibrium state .",
    "hence , we can use the virial theorem to derive a _ lower _ ( i.e conservative ) limit of the amount of energy required by the transformation as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the halo potential energy @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the halo mass profile , which can be integrated analytically from eq .",

    "this indicates that unbinding the very central cusp is the energetically demanding part of the transformation , whilst re - distributing dm beyond the halo scale radius requires , in comparison , a relatively small amount of energy , suggesting that our results will not be strongly sensitive to the details of the outer halo profile .    in our models the initial state of the halo",

    ". a higher fraction of massive stars would increase the feedback energy reservoir without aggravating the over - abundance of luminous substructures .",
    "an alternative route out of the tension is for the satellite luminosity function to be substantially reshaped by mechanisms other than suppression of galaxy formation .",
    "recent hydro - dynamical simulations show that baryonic feedback lowers the number of surviving satellites with respect to the dm - only case ( zolotov et al .",
    "this difference is partially due to the enhanced mass - loss rate of satellites embedded in cored dm haloes ( pearrubia et al .",
    "baryonic feedback may therefore ease the constraints discussed above by increasing the tidal disruption rate of massive ( bright ) subhaloes moving on eccentric orbits .",
    "the fact that the star formation efficiencies of the bright mw satellites lie above those dictated by abundance matching arguments ( sawala et al .",
    "2012 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2012 ) may point in this direction .",
    "our results also provide compelling reasons to push measurements of halo mass profiles to galaxies with @xmath134 , as the tension between ` core / cusp ' and ` missing satellites ' problems only increases toward lower luminosity .",

    "<S> we calculate the energy that baryons must inject in cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes in order to remove centrally - divergent dm cusps on scales relevant to observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the cdm haloes often associated with the milky way s dsphs ( @xmath0 ) require @xmath1erg in order to form cores on scales comparable to the luminous size of these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> while supernova type ii ( sneii ) explosions can in principle generate this energy , the actual contribution is limited by the low star formation efficiency implied by the abundance of luminous satellites . </S>",
    "<S> considering that cdm s well - known ` core / cusp ' and ` missing satellite ' problems place opposing demands on star formation efficiencies , existing observational evidences for large cores in the most luminous dsphs require that cdm models invoke some combination of the following : ( i ) efficient ( of order unity ) coupling of sneii energy into dark matter particles , ( ii ) star formation histories peaking at unexpectedly high redshifts @xmath2 ) , ( iii ) a top - heavy stellar imf , and/or ( iv ) substantial satellite disruption or other stochastic effects to ease the substructure abundance constraints . </S>",
    "<S> our models show that the tension between cdm problems on small scales would increase if cored dm profiles were to be found in fainter dwarves . </S>"
