    "in recent years , photo- and electroproduction of @xmath4 mesons on nucleons and nuclei have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "this renewed interest has been triggered primarily by the significant improvement on the quality of experimental data obtained with the new generation of high - duty cycle electron accelerators like , e.g. , elsa in bonn and mami in mainz @xcite .",
    "the special interest in the electromagnetic production of @xmath4 mesons on the nucleon is based on the fact that , being an isoscalar meson , it constitutes a selective filter for isospin @xmath5 nucleon resonances @xmath6 . furthermore , the e.m .",
    "@xmath4 production is dominated by the intermediate excitation of the @xmath0(1535 ) resonance .",
    "thus this reaction is an ideal tool for investigating the characteristic features of this resonance , which usually is difficult to separate from the other resonances because of their large widths .",
    "for example , one can study its electromagnetic transition multipoles and its decay channels , thus providing a good test for hadron models .",
    "eta photoproduction on the deuteron is of particular interest since first it allows to study this reaction on a bound nucleon in the simplest nuclear environment , and second , it provides important information on this reaction on the neutron . with respect to the latter case ,",
    "the deuteron is considered as a neutron target assuming that binding effects can be neglected .",
    "the first data for coherent @xmath4 photoproduction on the deuteron were obtained almost thirty years ago by anderson and prepost @xcite .",
    "their results for the weighting of isoscalar and isovector amplitude of the @xmath0(1535 ) resonance were at variance with quark model predictions and data analysis for pion photo production on the nucleon in the region of the @xmath0 resonance . only with a large isovector amplitude",
    ", the theory could explain the data assuming the validity of the impulse approximation @xcite .",
    "other explanations were proposed by hoshi et al .",
    "@xcite by invoking a dominance of @xmath4 rescattering on the other nucleon or a large influence of the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "the latter seems to be ruled out at present .",
    "furthermore , their treatment of rescattering is very approximate and a more recent evaluation of rescattering effects , although still approximate , gave a much smaller effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , improved calculations are urgently needed .",
    "very recently , rescattering has been considered in @xcite in the near threshold region showing only a small effect .",
    "it is clear that new data will offer the chance to investigate this problem in greater detail . with respect to new experimental data ,",
    "only upper limits exist at present for the reaction on the deuteron @xcite which , however , are already at variance with the old data .",
    "the aim of the present work is to initiate a systematic study of the @xmath8 reaction on the deuteron from threshold through the @xmath0 resonance . as a first step",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) in order to study details of the elementary reaction amplitude with respect to the yet unknown neutron properties and to study different ways of implementing the elementary amplitude in a bound system .    among the phenomenological models describing existing data for the elementary process on the proton for energies below 1 gev in a satisfactory manner ,",
    "there are the isobar model @xcite , the coupled channel model @xcite and the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the langrangian approach of @xcite because the resonance and background terms are treated on the same level and the number of unknown parameters is much less than that for the two other models .",
    "near threshold the resonances @xmath9(1440 ) , @xmath10(1520 ) and @xmath0(1535 ) are likely to contribute .",
    "although the @xmath9(1440 ) is below the threshold , it can influence the reaction because of its large width .",
    "little is known on the decay widths of the resonances @xmath9(1440 ) and @xmath10(1520 ) to @xmath11 and they are not listed in @xcite . in @xcite , the branching ratio of the @xmath10(1520 ) into this channel",
    "is listed to be @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the experiment of krusche et al .",
    "@xcite did not give any evidence for the influence of the @xmath9(1440 ) , whereas the @xmath10(1520 ) was seen for the first time .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that the influence of the @xmath10(1520 ) to the total cross section was negligible .",
    "for these reasons , it is legitimate to consider in the present study only the dominant @xmath0 resonance .",
    "in addition we include background terms such as nucleon pole terms and the exchange of the vector mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "apart from the resonance , also the strength and nature ( pseudoscalar or pseudovector ) of the @xmath13-coupling is widely unknown .",
    "when implementing the elementary reaction amplitude into the deuteron , one has to face several problems which are analogous to coherent @xmath14 photoproduction on the deuteron .",
    "first of all , the energy of the struck nucleon on which the reaction takes place is not well defined in a bound nonrelativistic system .",
    "consequently , the invariant mass of the @xmath15 subsystem of the elementary reaction , on which the elementary @xmath16-matrix depends , is not well defined .",
    "in particular , the invariant mass determines the decay width of the resonance to which the resulting cross section is very sensitive .",
    "secondly , the elementary reaction amplitude , which usually is given in the @xmath15 c.m .",
    "frame , has to be transformed to an arbitrary reference frame .",
    "this may be done either by a lorentz boost of all four momenta on which the elementary process depends or by calculating the @xmath16-matrix with respect to an arbitrary frame right from the beginning .",
    "the last method is more general because one does not loose any terms which vanish in the @xmath15 c.m .",
    "but in both cases one faces again the problem of assigning an energy to the bound nucleon .",
    "we will compare both methods for the contributions of vector meson exchange in order to check to what extent the differences matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the model for the elementary reaction , and fix all parameters for the process on the proton .",
    "then we discuss in sect .",
    "iii the theoretical changes that have to be considered for the process on the deuteron . in sect .",
    "iv we present our results and compare them with existing experimental data and other theoretical calculations . finally , we give a brief summary and an outlook .",

[",

    "we will discuss these two points now in some detail .",
    "for a bound system of two nucleons , the general expression for @xmath129 is , assuming the reaction to take place at nucleon `` 1 '' , @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes its initial ( final ) four momentum . in general",

    "in fact , the energy of an individual bound nucleon of a nonrelativistic many - particle system is not well defined .",
    "only the total sum of the energies of all nucleons is a well defined quantity , e.g. , for the deuteron @xmath134 .",
    "one of many possible choices is to distribute the total energy of the deuteron equally on each of the two nucleons ( blankenbecler - sugar choice ) in the deuteron rest system , i.e. , each nucleon has the energy @xmath135 , independent of the momentum .",
    "making such an assignment for the initial two nucleons , the boost to the @xmath97 c.m .",
    "system gives then with @xmath136 @xmath137 while for the final two nucleons one finds @xmath138    another possibility is to take the active nucleon on - shell either before or after the interaction .",
    "in the first case , one finds with @xmath139 @xmath140 whereas in the second case with the final nucleon on - shell , i.e.@xmath141 , one has @xmath142 the former choice has been made in @xcite . in all these three cases ,",
    "the invariant mass depends on the kinematics , i.e. , for fixed nucleon momentum on the angle between @xmath127 and the outgoing @xmath4 momentum @xmath128 .    the last choice , we want to discuss is to put the spectator nucleon on - shell , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "this choice has been taken in @xcite .",
    "it is also used in coherent @xmath144 photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite , and it may be justified by the fact that the deuteron is only loosely bound , and hence the spectator acts nearly like a free nucleon . we obtain in this case @xmath145 which is independent from the direction of @xmath127 .",
    "figure [ fig:1wsub ] shows the invariant mass @xmath129 for these different choices as function of the spectator momentum at fixed photon lab energy @xmath146 mev .",
    "for the first four choices ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) we have represented the boundaries of the range spanned by the angle dependence by two curves corresponding to @xmath127 and @xmath126 or @xmath128 parallel ( upper curve ) and antiparallel ( lower curve ) .",
    "one readily notes that @xmath149 spans the largest range , while the smaller ranges of @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath150 are compatible with each other .",
    "however , the average invariant masses nearly coincide for @xmath149 and @xmath150 , and they show a slight increase with increasing spectator momentum , whereas it decreases for both @xmath147 and @xmath148 which , moreover , show a very similar behaviour . finally , @xmath151 gives the lowest invariant mass with the strongest decrease with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the main contribution to the total cross section originates from momenta @xmath67 below 400 mev .",
    "but even in this region one notes a sizeable difference between the various choices for the invariant mass of the active @xmath15 subsystem .",
    "now we will illustrate for the case of @xmath3 meson exchange the two methods for deriving the elementary production operator for a general frame of reference as mentioned above . to this end , we evaluate first the corresponding feynman diagrams for an arbitrary frame ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath16-matrix is expressed in terms of two amplitudes @xmath152 and @xmath153 which are also defined in the appendix .",
    "these in turn can be represented as linear combinations of the following operators @xmath154 we then specialize to the @xmath97 c.m .",
    "system by the replacements @xmath155 and @xmath156 , so that the @xmath15 subsystem moves with the total momentum @xmath127 .",

    "then , in order to proceed according to the second method , we specialize to the @xmath15 c.m .",
    "here one usually expresses the @xmath16-matrix in terms of the cgln amplitudes .",

    "the @xmath15 system moves with momentum @xmath127 according to our choice of variables ( see fig .  [",

    "is done by @xcite , the recoiling deuteron has been used as signal and the upper limits @xmath200b for @xmath201 mev and @xmath202b for @xmath203 mev have been obtained . in fig .",
    "[ fig : game3 ] we show theoretical total cross sections for the six different values of @xmath199 for the parameter sets ( a ) through ( f ) of table [ tab : game3 ] .",
    "although these resonance couplings vary over a wide range , the variation in the total cross sections is much less pronounced in the near threshold region than at higher energies .",
    "even a sign change in @xmath204 does not show a big influence as one can see by comparing the results of set ( c ) with ( e ) or ( d ) with ( f ) except above the resonance region where the interference with the background becomes more important .",
    "the experimental upper limit is reached for the set ( g ) as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schranke ] .",
    "all parameter sets of table [ tab : game3 ] give total cross sections compatibel with the experimental estimates for the coherent deuteron cross section of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , if one takes the quark model seriously , the parameter sets ( d ) through ( g ) can be excluded while ( c ) is on the borderline .",
    "thus we conclude that the most probable parameter sets are ( a ) through ( c ) which give a neutron amplitude @xmath199 between @xmath205 and @xmath206gev@xmath183 .",
    "the set ( a ) reproduces the experimental ratio for @xmath207 @xcite , whereas we find the best agreement with the theoretical results of @xcite for the set ( c ) . in this case , the ratio of neutron to proton cross section is only 2/5 .",
    "now we want to discuss the influence of different choices for the invariant mass of the @xmath15 subsystem .",
    "figure [ fig : wsub0668 ] presents the total cross sections for the @xmath0 resonance alone obtained with four of the different choices for the invariant mass @xmath129 as discussed in sect .",
    "[ deuteron ] .",
    "we did not consider @xmath148 because it is very similar to @xmath147 .",
    "since for this question the exact value of @xmath177 is not relevant , we have used here @xmath208gev@xmath183 .",
    "one readily notes considerable differences for the various prescriptions .",
    "the largest total cross section is obtained with the spectator on shell @xmath151 having its maximum at 750 mev .",
    "if one puts the active nucleon on shell , i.e. , takes @xmath149 or @xmath150 instead , the maximum is decreased by about 18% and slightly shifted towards higher energies .    this decrease and shift",
    "can be understood as a result of the assignment of a higher invariant mass to the @xmath15 subsystem and the additional smearing due to the dependence on the angle between the spectator momentum and the photon , respective eta momentum ( see fig .  [ fig:1wsub ] ) which leads to a larger effective width .",
    "the result is a slight upshift of the resonance position and a broadening , thus lowering of the maximum .",
    "one notes also little difference between putting the active nucleon before or after the interaction on shell . from the foregoing discussion it is apparent",
    "that the curve for the blankenbecler - sugar assignment @xmath147 is about halfway between the spectator on shell and the active nucleon on shell because according to fig .",
    "[ fig:1wsub ] @xmath147 lies in between the spectator and active nucleon assignments .",
    "the differential cross sections for three photon energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : difsub ] show a similar behaviour with respect to the invariant mass assignment . in particular at lower energies ( see as example the cross section at @xmath209 mev in fig .",
    "[ fig : difsub ] ) the differences are quite sizeable in forward direction .    in view of these results , we have to conclude that the choice for the invariant mass of the @xmath15 subsystem has a significant influence on the cross section . in order to obtain a cross section of the same magnitude for two different choices of @xmath129",
    ", one has to change the elementary helicity amplitude , too .",
    "consequently , the other correlated parameters ( see table [ tab : game3 ] ) will change together with the assignment for the invariant mass .",
    "this has also some bearing on the question of compatibility with quark model predictions .    as last point",
    "we want to discuss the different methods of deriving the elementary production operator in an arbitrary frame which is necessary for implementing it into the bound system , i.e. , we will compare the more general case using an arbitrary frame ( gc ) , the lorentz boost of the momenta from the @xmath15 c.m .",
    "frame ( lb ) , and the simplest approach of taking the elementary operator without any transformation of the variables ( cm ) . the last method , for example , is considered in @xcite for the coherent @xmath144 photoproduction on the deuteron where only the momentum of the @xmath210 resonance is transformed while for the background terms this has not been done , assuming the effect to be negligible . while for the pion this might be justified because of its low mass , one certainly would not expect it to be a valid approximation for the eta meson .",
    "we present results for two choices of the neutron helicity amplitude , namely @xmath211gev@xmath183 ( a ) and @xmath208gev@xmath183 ( c ) ( table [ tab : game3 ] ) .",
    "the differential cross sections as a function of the photon laboratory energy and for constant c.m .",
    "angles are shown for both amplitudes in figs .",
    "[ fig:3maldeut22 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the differences between ( gc ) , ( lb ) , and ( cm ) depend not only on the angles and energies but also on the strength of the helicity amplitude chosen .",
    "comparing first ( gc ) and ( lb ) , we see that at forward angles the deviations are small .",
    "however , for backward angles they become more significant reaching a maximum at 180@xmath212 .",
    "the maximum is considerably lower for ( lb ) while at higher energies the differential cross setion for ( lb ) lies above the one for ( gc ) .",
    "on the other hand , the main contributions to the cross sections stem from small angles where also the differences are smaller so that the total cross sections differ much less . furthermore , using a larger helicity amplitude @xmath177 decreases the differences between the calculations ( gc ) and ( lb ) even more .",
    "that is the case for an @xmath177 with which we get a cross section comparable to the one of @xcite .    finally , comparing the calculation ( cm ) , to which only the first four operator structures of table [ tab : lt ] contribute , with ( gc ) one clearly sees very large deviations from ( gc ) which obviously are not tolerable .",
    "coherent eta photoproduction on the deuteron has been studied in the impulse approximation neglecting rescattering and two - body effects . for the elementary reaction",
    ", we have assumed that the process is dominated by the excitation of the @xmath0(1535 ) resonance for photon energies not too far above threshold .",
    "thus we have included the @xmath0 in the @xmath38- and @xmath39-channels .",
    "in addition , we have considered as background the @xmath16-channel vector meson exchange with @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as the nucleon pole terms in @xmath38- and @xmath39-channel for which pseudoscalar coupling has been assumed .",
    "the vertices are taken from an effective lagrangian theory .",
    "the elementary process is treated nonrelativistically .",
    "all parameters are fixed by fitting the experimental data for the reaction on the proton .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath199 for the @xmath0 excitation on the neutron cannnot be determined this way , and one needs data for the reaction on the deuteron . in view of the fact that up to now no precise data on the deuteron are available , we could only use the existing estimates to find limits for this amplitude .",
    "the experiment for quasifree production @xcite gave a value for the ratio of neutron to proton cross section with which we have obtained a deuteron cross section that is within the experimentally obtained limits of @xcite and @xcite . correlated with this",
    "is a ratio of the isoscalar to isovector amplitude that is consistent with quark model predictions .",
    "however , the upper limits of @xcite and @xcite for the coherent deuteron cross section are not sufficient for a precise determination of @xmath213 .",
    "an uncertainty of the factor ten is to be considered which could result in deviations from quark model predictions up to 50% .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the theoretical problems of implementing the elementary reaction amplitude into a bound system connected to the choice of the invariant mass for the resonance excitation and to the transformation of the reaction amplitude from the @xmath15 c.m .",

    "frame of the @xmath214-bound system , and we have found that the theoretical results show significant differences when using different prescriptions .    for the future we need on the experimental side precise data for both the coherent and the incoherent production on the deuteron in order to be able to fix in a reliable manner the @xmath0 excitation on the neutron .",
