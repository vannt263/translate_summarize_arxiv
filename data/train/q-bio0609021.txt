    "evolutionary game theory @xcite provides a powerful and unifying mathematical framework widely used in scientific areas as diverse as biology @xcite , economics @xcite , and social sciences .",
    "more recently , it has been attracting growing interest in physics @xcite , as several sophisticated techniques developed in the physics of complex systems have provided useful insights into this interdisciplinary framework @xcite . originally , evolutionary game theory was formulated in terms of infinite populations and the corresponding replicator dynamics @xcite . as a nonlinear dynamical system , these equations are of great interest being formally equivalent to the well studied lotka - volterra equations @xcite .",
    "much of our present intuition is based upon this deterministic framework that analyzes nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , any real population has finite size and also individual - based computer simulations in unstructured or structured populations @xcite always deal with finite populations .",
    "as is well known in physics , the behavior of a finite system can depart significantly from its infinite counterpart .",
    "recently , the concept of evolutionary stability has been specifically investigated for finite populations @xcite and the traditional concept of evolutionary stability has been challenged . analyzing the connection between the two frameworks of evolutionary stability",
    "we show that the difference between them is not solely based on finite size effects .    when selection is frequency independent",
    ", the idea of evolutionary stability is simple : a population evolves until a stable fixed point is reached at which fitness is maximized .",
    "in contrast with this situation , in evolutionary game theory the fitness of an individual depends on the type and frequency of its competitors .",
    "hence , the optimization of individual fitness can even lead to the decline of the average fitness , as in the prisoner s dilemma where each individual is better off not cooperating , although mutual cooperation leads to higher fitness @xcite .",
    "the standard definition of evolutionary stability formulated for infinite populations @xcite is equivalent to strong stability of the corresponding fixed point in the replicator dynamics @xcite : a strategy is an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) if individuals with this strategy are always better off than a small fraction of mutants .",
    "a similar result holds for infinite populations subject to external noise : in the stochastic replicator dynamics of fudenberg and harris @xcite , the population stays nearly all the time close to an ess if the ess corresponds to an interior state or if the payoff matrix satisfies a certain definiteness condition @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the stochastic replicator dynamics , strict nash equilibria are always asymptotically stochastically stable , provided the impact of the external noise is not too strong . however , for finite populations the concept of evolutionary stability has been challenged , as an ess defined as above is not necessarily stable anymore whenever the population size is finite @xcite .",
    "introduced a concept for evolutionary stability in finite populations ( ess@xmath0 ) proposing the additional requirement that selection has to oppose replacement by other strategies due to random drift @xcite . for coordination games corresponding to bistable situations",
    ", they also derived the condition under which selection favors the replacement of one strict nash equilibrium by the other .",
    "they found that replacement occurs if the unstable fixed point that is always present in coordination games is closer than @xmath1 to the strategy to be replaced .",
    "this finding obtained for weak selection contradicts the idea of evolutionary stability in infinite populations , where such a replacement can not occur .",
    "furthermore , even in simulations of finite populations such a replacement has not been demonstrated yet , as selection is usually strong in these systems .",
    "here we show that these two apparently contradicting concepts actually emerge as different limiting results of a unified treatment .",
    "both the traditional ess concept and the ess@xmath0 concept can be derived from the frequency dependent moran process in different limits . however , these results do not rely on moran dynamics .",
    "indeed , their general validity is shown to apply to other types of co - evolutionary dynamics , such as the frequency dependent wright - fisher process @xcite and the local update process investigated in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ moransec ] , we introduce the frequency dependent moran process and discuss how different limits lead to different concepts of evolutionary stability . in secs .",
    "[ lursec ] and [ wfsec ] , we show how the results transfer to the local update process and the frequency dependent wright - fisher process . finally , we discuss implications on the fixation times in sec .",
    "[ timesec ] .",
    "in evolutionary game theory , the fitness of an individual is determined by the payoff from its interactions with others .",
    "an @xmath2 individual will obtain a payoff @xmath3 from an interaction with @xmath2 individuals and @xmath4 from @xmath5 individuals .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 individuals gain @xmath6 from @xmath2 and @xmath7 from @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the payoffs are given by @xmath8 for the types @xmath2 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the population size and @xmath10 is the number of @xmath2 individuals in the population .",
    "self - interactions have been excluded . for the frequency",
    "dependent moran process @xcite , the fitness of an individual is a linear combination of a background fitness and the payoff from interactions , @xmath11 for @xmath2 individuals and analogously for @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 measures the intensity of selection . for @xmath13 ,",
    "selection is weak and the payoff of the game has only a marginal influence , whereas the background fitness becomes negligible for @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the fitness is always positive",
    ". an individual chosen proportional to its fitness produces one identical offspring which replaces a randomly chosen individual .",
    "the probability to increase the number of @xmath2 individuals from @xmath10 to @xmath15 is @xmath16 whereas the probability to decrease it from @xmath10 to @xmath17 is @xmath18 since @xmath19 and @xmath20 , this process has absorbing states at @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for large @xmath9 ,",
    "the master equation describing this process can be approximated by a fokker - planck equation with drift @xmath23 and diffusion @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fraction of type @xmath2 in the population @xcite .",
    "this fokker - planck equation corresponds to the stochastic differential equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wiener process , @xmath28 @xcite . for the frequency",
    "dependent moran process , we have @xmath29 for fixed selection intensity @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 vanishes and a deterministic replicator equation is obtained from the frequency dependent moran process @xcite . in this deterministic limit , a stable coexistence of @xmath2 and @xmath5 is possible .",
    "however , if @xmath33 , the stochasticity is retained even in the limit of infinite population size and the system will eventually get absorbed in the state @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the probability that the system gets absorbed in @xmath35 starting from @xmath36 ( in other words , the probability to reach the state with @xmath2 individuals only ) can be computed from the drift and diffusion term as @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that there are similarities between our absorption probabilities eq .",
    "( [ fixation ] ) and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in which a quantum description of game dynamics has been explored .    for neutral selection ,",
    "@xmath39 , the drift term vanishes , @xmath40 , and the fixation probability is simply the initial fraction of type @xmath2 , @xmath41 . for @xmath13 , the ratio @xmath42 that determines",
    "the fixation properties of the process becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "a particular interesting case is @xmath33 , in which the fixation probability eq .",
    "( [ fixation ] ) is given by @xmath46 for @xmath47 , this reduces to the fixation probability of a single mutant in the limit of weak selection , which has been computed directly from the moran process in @xcite .",
    "selection favors @xmath2 replacing @xmath5 if the fixation probability of a single @xmath2 mutant is higher than the fixation probability of a neutral mutant , which amounts to @xmath48 .",
    "for the evolutionary stability of the state with @xmath5 individuals only , the condition @xmath48 is of interest in the vicinity of @xmath34 .",
    "after derivation with respect to @xmath49 we find for @xmath34 the condition @xmath50 . for @xmath31 and @xmath51 with @xmath33 ,",
    "the development of @xmath52 reduces to @xmath53 .    for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "the fitness of @xmath2 is larger than the fitness of @xmath5 for any number of mutants . in this case",
    ", the condition @xmath52 is always fulfilled and @xmath2 will invade the population with a higher probability than a neutral mutant . on the other hand , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the strategy @xmath2 is disadvantageous and the probability for its invasion is smaller than that of a neutral mutant .",
    "however , the most interesting case is associated with those situations in which @xmath58 changes sign for a certain @xmath49 . here , we concentrate on coordination games in which @xmath54 and @xmath57 . in these games , the situation with 100% @xmath2 or 100% @xmath5 individuals are strict nash equilibria : if the population is dominated by type @xmath2 , a @xmath5 mutant is disadvantageous , but if @xmath5 dominates , @xmath2 individuals become disadvantageous .",
    "coordination games are bistable , i.e.  for an intermediate number of mutants the preferred direction of the evolutionary process changes , as the drift term @xmath59 changes sign .",
    "whereas in the deterministic replicator equation @xmath34 and @xmath35 are stable fixed points , stochasticity can lead from one point to the other , similar to a physical process in which stochastic fluctuations enable a particle to overcome an energy barrier . in asymmetric situations , stochasticity favors one equilibrium over the other , depending on the position of the unstable fixed point @xmath60 between them .",
    "when this point is close to @xmath61 , it is relatively easy for @xmath2 to invade , as a small group of @xmath2 individuals changes the sign of the drift term @xmath59 .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath54 and @xmath57 selection favors @xmath2 replacing @xmath5 if @xmath62 where @xmath60 is the unstable equilibrium of the game at which the fitness of both strategies is the same , @xmath63 .",
    "this result coined as @xmath1-rule by nowak _",
    "et al . _ can be derived directly from the exact fixation probabilities of the markov chain and is valid for @xmath33 .",
    "it is a central result of the ess@xmath0 concept @xcite .",
    "it can also be obtained in the same limit from eq .",
    "( [ moranfixation ] ) with @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ moranfixation ] ) shows that this @xmath1-rule extends beyond the case of a single mutant and is also obtained if the fixation probability of a fixed number of mutants is investigated .    in general , the stochasticity arising from finite populations is qualitatively different from the gaussian noise incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that the approximation of population dynamics in finite populations with stochastic differential equations agree for weak selection perfectly with the direct calculation for arbitrary @xmath9 , although the langevin approximation implicitly assumes large populations .",
    "however , if @xmath30 remains bounded away from zero , we can no longer assume @xmath33 for @xmath64 and the @xmath1-rule is violated , as illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ moranonethird ] ) diverges for @xmath31 and fixed @xmath13 .",

    "as @xmath5 and @xmath2 are ess in coordination games , this is exactly what the traditional evolutionary stability predicts .",
    "hence , we have shown that evolutionary stability depends on the quantity @xmath69 , i.e. the size of the population times the intensity of selection .",
    "@xmath33 leads to the ess@xmath0 concept from @xcite , whereas @xmath70 reveals the traditional ess concept @xcite .",
    "there is no contradiction between these notions of evolutionary stability : they both constitute two extreme limits of the quantity @xmath69 . indeed ,",
    "as explicitly shown in the next two sections , this result does not depend on the frequency dependent moran process adopted so far .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath69 , the position of the unstable equilibrium @xmath60 such that selection favors the replacement of @xmath5 by @xmath2 can be solved numerically from @xmath71 for a given payoff matrix , as shown in fig .",
