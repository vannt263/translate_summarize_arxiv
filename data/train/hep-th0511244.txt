    "the kinematical group of a relativistic formalism is the poincar group .",
    "the hilbert space of states of an elementary particle carries an irreducible representation of the poincar group .",
    "the intrinsic properties of an elementary particle are thus associated to the casimir invariants of its symmetry group .",
    "the poincar group has two casimir operators whose eigenvalues define two intrinsic properties of elementary particles , namely the mass and spin",
    ". elementary matter , in addition to mass and spin , has another set of properties like electric charge , isospin , baryonic and leptonic number , strangeness , etc .",
    ", whose origin is not clearly connected to any space - time symmetry group .",
    "they are supposed to be related to some internal symmetry groups .",
    "the adjective internal is used here to mean that this symmetry is coming from some unknown degrees of freedom , whose geometrical interpretation is not very clear and perhaps suggesting that they are not connected with any space - time transformations .    in this paper we shall consider a classical poincar invariant model of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized .",
    "the aim of this work is to show that it has a larger space - time symmetry group than the poincar group , which will be analyzed in detail , for the classical model and its quantum mechanical representation .",
    "the kinematical formalism of elementary particles developed by the author @xcite defines a classical elementary particle as a mechanical system whose kinematical space is a homogeneous space of the kinematical group of space - time transformations .",
    "the kinematical space of any mechanical system is , by definition , the manifold spanned by the variables which define the initial and final state of the system in the variational description .",
    "it is a manifold larger than the configuration space and it consists of the time variable and the independent degrees of freedom and their time derivatives up to one order less than the highest order they have in the lagrangian function which defines the action integral .",
    "conversely , if the kinematical space of a mechanical system is known , then , necessarily , the lagrangian for this system is a function of these kinematical variables and their next order time derivative .",
    "please , remark that , as a general statement , we do not restrict the lagrangians to depend only on the first time derivatives of the degrees of freedom .",
    "we make emphasis in the description of the classical formalism in terms of the end point variables of the variational approach .",
    "the advantage of this formalism with respect to other approaches for describing classical spinning particles is outlined in chapter 5 of reference @xcite , where a comparative analysis of different models is performed .",
    "one of the features is that any classical system which fulfils with this classical definition of elementary particle has the property that , when quantized , its hilbert space is a representation space of a projective unitary irreducible representation of the kinematical group .",
    "it thus complies with wigner s definition of an elementary particle in the quantum formalism @xcite .",
    "another is that it is not necessary to postulate any particular lagrangian .",
    "it is sufficient to fix the kinematical variables ( which span a homogeneous space of the poincar group ) for describing some plausible elementary models . in particular ,",
    "if the variational formalism is stated in terms of some arbitrary and poincar invariant evolution parameter @xmath0 , then the lagrangian of any mechanical system is a homogeneous function of first degree of the @xmath1derivatives of the kinematical variables .",
    "feynman s quantization shows the importance of the end point variables of the variational formalism .",
    "they are the only variables which survive after every path integral and feynman s probability amplitude is an explicit function of all of them and not of the independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the physical interest of this work is to analyze the symmetries of a model of a spinning dirac particle described within this framework which has the property that its center of mass and center of charge are different points .",
    "it has been proven recently that the electromagnetic interaction of two of these particles with the same charge produces metastable bound states provided the spins of both particles are parallel and their relative separation , center of mass velocity and internal phase fulfill certain requirements @xcite .",
    "electromagnetism does not allow the possibility of formation of bound pairs for spinless point particles of the same charge .",
    "nevertheless , two of these spinning particles , although the force between the charges is repulsive , it can become atractive for the motion of their center of masses , provided the two particles are separated below compton s wavelength .",
    "electromagnetism does not forbid the existence of bound pairs of this kind of spinning dirac particles .    because the variational formalism when written in terms of the kinematical variables seems to be not widespread we shall briefly describe some of its basic features in sections 2 to 4 .",
    "very technical details are left for a reading of the original publications .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a particular parameterization of the poincar group in order to properly interpret the geometrical meaning of the variables which span the different homogeneous spaces .",
    "these variables will be treated as the kinematical variables of the corresponding elementary systems . in section 3",
    "we consider the classical model which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized and we describe its main features .",
    "this dirac particle is a system of six degrees of freedom .",
    "three represent the position of a point ( the position of the charge of the particle ) which is moving at the speed of light and the other three represent its orientation in space .",
    "it is a point - like particle with orientation .",
    "the lagrangian will also depend on the acceleration of the point and of the angular velocity of its local oriented frame .",
    "section 4 shows how feynman s quantization of the kinematical formalism describe the wave function and the differential structure of the generators of the symmetry groups in this representation .",
    "in section 5 we analyze the additional space - time symmetries of the model , which reduce to the space - time dilations and the local rotations of the body frame .",
    "section 6 deals with the analysis of the complete space - time symmetry group , its casimir operators and the irreducible representations for this spin @xmath2 dirac particle .",
    "once the symmetry group has been enlarged , a greater kinematical space can be defined .",
    "chapter 7 considers the requirement of enlarging the kinematical space , by adding a classical phase , in order for the system to still satisfy dirac s equation .",
    "finally , section 8 contains a summary of the main results and some final comments about the relationship between this new symmetry group and the standard model .",
    "the explicit calculation of the structure of the generators is included in the appendix .",
    "any group element @xmath3 of the poincar group can be parameterized by the ten variables @xmath4 which have the following dimensions and domains : @xmath5 is a time variable which describes the time translation , @xmath6 are three position variables associated to the three - dimensional space translations , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , are three velocity parameters which define the relative velocity between observers and , finally , the three dimensionless @xmath9 , which represent the relative orientation between the corresponding cartesian frames .",
    "these dimensions will be shared by the variables which define the corresponding homogeneous spaces of the poincar group .",
    "the manifold spanned by the variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the space - time manifold , which is clearly a homogeneous space of the poincar group . according to our definition of elementary particle",
    ", it represents the kinematical space of the spinless point particle .",
    "these variables are interpreted as the time and position of the particle .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian will be , in general , a function of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and its time derivative , the velocity of the point @xmath11 .",
    "it can be easily deduced from invariance requirements and it is uniquely defined up to a total @xmath1derivative @xcite .    to describe spinning particles we have to consider larger homogeneous spaces than the space - time manifold .",
    "the poincar group has three maximal homogeneous spaces spanned by the above ten variables but with some minor restrictions .",
    "one is the complete group manifold , where the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "another is that manifold with the constraint @xmath12 , and it will therefore describe particles where the point @xmath11 is moving at the speed of light , and finally the manifold where @xmath13 and this allows to describe tachyonic matter .",
    "the remaining variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 have the same domains as above . in all three cases , the initial and final state of a classical elementary particle in the variational approach",
    "is described by the measurement of a time @xmath10 , the position of a point @xmath11 , the velocity of this point @xmath15 and the orientation of the particle @xmath14 , which can be interpreted as the orientation of a local instantaneous frame of unit axis @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with origin at the point @xmath11 .",
    "the difference between the three cases lies in the intrinsic character of the velocity parameter @xmath18 which can be used to describe particles whose position @xmath11 moves always with velocity below , above or equal to @xmath19 .",
    "the lagrangian for describing these systems will be in general , a function of these ten variables , with the corresponding constraint on the @xmath18 variable , and also of their time derivatives",
    ". it will be thus also a function of the acceleration of the point @xmath11 and of the angular velocity @xmath20 of the motion of the body local frame .",
    "this is what the general kinematical formalism establishes .",
    "the systems which satisfy dirac s equation when quantized , correspond to the systems for which @xmath12 .",
    "for these systems the point @xmath11 represents the position of the charge of the particle , but not the centre of mass @xmath21 , which , for a spinning particle , results a different point than @xmath11 .",
    "this separation is analytically related to the dependence of the lagrangian on the acceleration .",
    "the spin structure is related to this separation between @xmath11 and @xmath21 and its relative motion and , also to the rotation of the body frame with angular velocity @xmath20 .",
    "this separation between the center of mass and center of charge of a spinning particle is a feature also shared by some other spinning models which can be found in chapter 5 of reference @xcite .",
    "all these particle models represent point - like objects with orientation but whose centre of mass is a different point than the point where the charge of the particle is located . the classical dynamical equation satisfied by the position @xmath11 of these systems was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the quantization of the models with @xmath22 shows that the corresponding quantum systems are only spin @xmath2 particles .",
    "no higher spin elementary systems are obtained when using that manifold as a kinematical space . in the tachyonic case",
    "only spin 1 is allowed . for particles with @xmath8",
    "the maximum spin is only @xmath23 .",
    "let us consider any regular lagrangian system whose lagrangian depends on time @xmath10 , on the @xmath24 independent degrees of freedom @xmath25 , @xmath26 and their time derivatives up to a finite order @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the kinematical variables in the following form : @xmath29 this system of @xmath24 degrees of freedom has a kinematical space of dimension @xmath30 .",
    "we can always write this lagrangian in terms of the kinematical variables @xmath31 and their next order @xmath1derivative @xmath32 , where @xmath0 is any arbitrary , poincar invariant , evolution parameter .",
    "the advantage of working with an arbitary evolution parameter is that the lagrangian expressed in this way becomes a homogeneous function of first degree of the @xmath1derivatives of the kinematical variables .",
    "in fact , each time derivative @xmath33 can be written as a quotient of two @xmath1derivatives of two kinematical variables @xmath34 , and thus @xmath35 it is the last @xmath36 term which makes the integrand a homogeneous function of first degree of the derivatives of the kinematical variables .",
    "it thus satisfies euler s theorem for homogeneous functions @xmath37 the generalized coordinates are the degrees of freedom and their time derivatives up to order @xmath38 , so that there are up to @xmath39 generalized momenta @xmath40 which are defined by @xmath41 the hamiltonian is @xmath42 and the phase space is thus of dimension @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 is a @xmath45parameter symmetry group of parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which leaves invariant the lagrangian and transforms infinitesimally the kinematical variables in the form @xmath48 the @xmath49 conserved noether s observables are given by @xmath50 the advantage of this formulation is that we can obtain general expressions for the conserved quantities in terms of the above @xmath51 functions , and their time derivatives , which are homogeneous functions of zero - th degree of the variables @xmath52 and of the way the kinematical variables transform @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider now any lagrangian system whose kinematical space is spanned by the variables @xmath54 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the general form of any lagrangian of this kind of systems is @xmath55 where according to the above homogeneity property ( [ eq : hom ] ) , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "if instead of @xmath60 we consider the angular velocity @xmath20 , which is a linear function of the @xmath60 , the last term @xmath61 , can be transformed into @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "we thus get , the following conserved quantities from the invariance of the lagrangian under the poincar group .",
    "these expressions are independent of the particular lagrangian we take , as far as we keep fixed the corresponding kinematical space .",
    "the energy and linear momentum @xmath64 and the kinematical and angular momentum are , respectively @xmath65 @xmath66 is the translation invariant part of the angular momentum .",
    "it is the classical equivalent of dirac s spin observable .",
    "it is the sum of two parts @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 part comes from the dependence of the lagrangian on @xmath69 and the @xmath70 part from the dependence on the angular velocity .",
    "the time derivative of the conserved @xmath71 leads to @xmath72 . since in general the structure of the linear momentum , given in ( [ eq : hp ] )",

    "@xmath66 is a constant vector and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , so that for positive energy @xmath76 particles we get , from the expression of the kinematical momentum ( [ eq : kj ] ) , the dynamical equation for the point @xmath11 @xmath77 the point @xmath11 moves in circles at the speed of light on a plane orthogonal to the constant spin , as depicted in figure [ fig : elec ] . for negative energy @xmath78",
    "we get the time reversed motion .",
    "the motion of the charge around the centre of mass is a circular motion , known as the zitterbewegung , of radius @xmath79 , _ i.e. _ , half compton s wavelength when quantized , and angular frequency @xmath80 .",
    "since the energy @xmath81 is not definite positive we can describe matter and antimatter .",
    "they have a different chirality .",
    "matter is left - handed while antimatter is right - handed . for matter , once the spin direction is fixed , the motion of the charge is counterclockwise when looking along the spin direction .",
    "the phase of this internal motion of the charge is increasing in the opposite direction to the usual sign convention for @xmath82-forms .",
    "the motion is clockwise for antimatter .",
    "the classical expression equivalent to dirac s equation is obtained by taking the time derivative of the kinematical momentum @xmath83 in ( [ eq : kj ] ) , and a subsequent scalar product with @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the linear relationship between @xmath81 and @xmath73 @xmath84 it is the quantum representation of this relationship between observables when acting on the wavefunction of the system , which produces dirac s equation @xcite .",
    "if we analyze this classical particle in the centre of mass frame it becomes a mechanical system of three degrees of freedom .",
    "these are the @xmath31 and @xmath85 coordinates of the point charge on the plane and the phase @xmath86 of the rotation of the body axis with angular velocity @xmath87 . but",
    "this phase is the same as the phase of the orbital motion and because this motion is a circle of constant radius only one degree of freedom is left , for instance , the @xmath31 coordinate . in the centre of mass frame",
    "the system is thus equivalent to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator of angular frequency @xmath80 in its ground state .",
    "the ground energy of this one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath88 for particles , so that the classical constant parameter @xmath89",
    ". all lagrangian systems defined with this kinematical space have this behaviour and represent spin @xmath2 particles when quantized . if this model represents an elementary particle it has no excited states and thus no higher spin model can be obtained which has the same kinematical space as this one .",
    "when quantizing any mechanical system described by means of this kinematical formalism , through feynman s path integral approach @xcite , the quantization leads to the following results :    1 .   if @xmath31 are the kinematical variables of the variational approach , feynman s kernel @xmath90 which describes the probability amplitude for the evolution of the system between the initial point @xmath91 to the final point @xmath92 , is only a function ( more properly a distribution ) of the end point kinematical variables .",
    "2 .    the wave function of the quantized system is a complex squared integrable function of these variables @xmath93 , with respect to some suitable invariant measure over the kinematical space .",

    "the poincar group unitary realization over the corresponding hilbert space has the usual selfadjoint generators .",
    "they are represented by the differential operators , with respect to the kinematical variables , which are obtained in detail in the appendix : @xmath97 @xmath98 or in three - vector form @xmath99 @xmath100 the spin operator @xmath66 is given by @xmath101 @xmath102 is the gradient operator with respect to the @xmath103 variables and the @xmath70 operator involves differential operators with respect to the orientation variables .",
    "its structure depends on the election of the variables which represent the orientation and which correspond to the different parameterizations of the rotation group . in the normal or canonical parameterization of the rotation group ,",
    "every rotation is characterized by a three vector @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a unit vector along the rotation axis and @xmath86 the clokwise rotated angle .",

    "up to this point we have outlined the main classical and quantum mechanical features of the kinematical formalism and of the model of the elementary spinning particle of spin 1/2 we want to further analyze .",
    "the kinematical variables of this classical spinning elementary particle are reduced to time @xmath10 , position @xmath11 , velocity @xmath15 and orientation @xmath14 , but the velocity is always @xmath12 .",
    "it is always @xmath120 in natural units .",
    "if the particle has mass @xmath121 and spin @xmath122 , we can also define a natural unit of length @xmath123 and a natural unit of time @xmath124 .",
    "the unit of length is the radius of the zitterbewegung motion of figure [ fig : elec ] , and the unit of time is the time employed by the charge , in the centre of mass frame , during a complete turn .",
    "this implies that the whole set of kinematical variables and their time derivatives can be taken dimensionless , and the classical formalism is therefore invariant under space - time dilations which do not modify the speed of light .",
    "it turns out that although we started with the poincar group as the basic space - time symmetry group , this kind of massive spinning dirac particles , has a larger symmetry group .",
    "it also contains at least space - time dilations with generator @xmath125 .",

    "it has no physical reality but can be interpreted as the corresponding cartesian frame of some instantaneous inertial observer with origin at that point .",
    "but the election of this frame is completely arbitrary so that the formalism has to be independent of its actual value .",
    "this means that , in addition to the above rotation group which modifies the laboratory axes , there will be another rotation group of elements @xmath130 which modifies only the orientation variables @xmath14 , without modifying the variables @xmath11 and @xmath15 , _ i.e. _ , the rotation only of the body frame : @xmath131 the generators of this new rotation group , which affects only to the orientation variables , will be the projection of the angular momentum generators @xmath70 onto the body axes . from noether s theorem",
    "the corresponding classical conserved observables are @xmath132 where the @xmath16 are the three orthogonal unit vectors which define the body axis .",
    "if @xmath129 is the orthogonal rotation matrix which describes the orientation of the particle , when considered by columns these columns describe the components of the three orthogonal unit vectors @xmath16 , @xmath17 . the equations ( [ eq : roto ] )",

    "therefore its mass and goes into another mass state .    the structure of the differential operator @xmath157 , where the spin part @xmath67 has only @xmath158 eigenvalue for the above model , implies that the eigenvalue of the @xmath159 corresponds to @xmath160 while for the @xmath161 part can be reduced to the two possibilities @xmath162 or @xmath163 .",
    "in addition to the group @xmath150 we also consider the representation of the local rotation group generated by the @xmath138 with eigenvalue @xmath164 .",
