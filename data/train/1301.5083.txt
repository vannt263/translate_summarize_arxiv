    "the b92 quantum - key - distribution ( qkd ) protocol @xcite has remained less popular than the famous bb84 protocol @xcite , while both protocols provide the unconditional security .",
    "one plausible reason for the unpopularity is that the b92 is weaker to the channel noise than the bb84 .",
    "specifically , the bb84 with the standard one - way information reconciliation can generate secure key over the depolarizing channel at depolarizing rate 16.5% , while the previous security analyses of the b92 can not guarantee the secure key generation at depolarizing rate 3.5% @xcite , 3.7% @xcite or 4.2% @xcite .",
    "the conventional security analyses of the b92 @xcite involved many inequalities , and the tightness of those inequalities was not explicitly discussed .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the b92 protocol can securely generate key at depolarizing rates over 4.2% . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymptotic secure key rate in @xcite is expressed as the minimum of conditional quantum entropy over a certain set of bipartite quantum states . by using the convex optimization technique",
    ", we can completely remove careful manipulation of many inequalities , which could underestimate the secure key rate . in this paper",
    "we reformulate the asymptotic secure key rate formula as a convex optimization problem , and compute the rate without any manipulation of inequalities directly by a numerical optimization procedure . as a result",
    ", we show that the b92 protocol @xcite without noisy preprocessing @xcite can securely generate key at 6.5% depolarizing rate .",
    "in this section , we present a new formula for the asymptotic key rate of the b92 protocol , based on renner s security argument @xcite .",
    "firstly , we fix notations .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be some fixed orthonormal basis of a qubit . in the b92 protocol @xcite , alice sends the quantum state @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . for convenience of presentation",
    ", we also define @xmath6 we can see that @xmath7 , @xmath8 forms an orthonormal basis of a qubit .    on the other hand , we can express a qubit channel as follows .",
    "define the three pauli matrices @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 as usual .",
    "then a qubit density matrix @xmath12 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the vector @xmath16 is called a bloch vector .",
    "the qubit channel @xmath17 from alice to bob can be expressed as a map between bloch vectors by @xmath18 where @xmath19    define @xmath20 as in @xcite , we also define the four povm @xmath21 after passing the quantum channel @xmath17 from alice to bob , @xmath22 becomes @xmath23 in a quantum key distribution protocol , the state change @xmath17 is caused by eve s cloning of the transmitted qubits to her quantum memory .",
    "the content of eve s quantum memory is mathematically described by the purification @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to eve s quantum memory , she also knows the content of public communication over the classical public channel between alice and bob . for each transmitted qubit from alice to bob ,",
    "the public communication consists of @xmath27-bit information indicating whether bob discards his received qubit or not .",
    "we also have to take it into account .",
    "we shall represent the public communication by a classical random variable @xmath28 that becomes @xmath27 if bob discards his qubit and @xmath29 otherwise .",
    "so , @xmath30 when bob s measurement outcome is @xmath31 or @xmath32 , and @xmath33 when bob s measurement outcome is @xmath34 or @xmath35 .    on the other hand , in the b92 protocol , bob performs the measurement specified by eqs .",
    "( [ povm1])([povm4 ] ) .",
    "alice and bob keep their a qubit if and only if its measurement outcome is @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "otherwise it is discarded and is not used for generation of secret key .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to set alice s bit to @xmath29 if the measurement outcomes is @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
