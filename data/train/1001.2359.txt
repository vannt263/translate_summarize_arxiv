    "quantum information transfer between light and atomic ensembles has attracted much attention recently . in particular , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , a robust technique that renders a resonant opaque medium transparent by means of destructive quantum interference , has been exploited to realize the storage and retrieval of light pulses in atomic ensembles @xcite . in the storage process ,",
    "a weak probe light pulse carrying quantum information and a strong coupling light are applied to an optically thick atomic ensemble .",
    "the probe light is then gradually converted into a ground - spin coherence as the coupling light is adiabatically switched off , and , as a result , the quantum information is stored in the atomic ensemble .",
    "the reading process is almost reverse to the storage : the control light is adiabatically turned on , and accordingly a new light pulse is created and propagates out of the atomic ensemble . in this way , the quantum information can be stored and read out without loss in principle .",
    "if two counter - propagating control light pulses with equal strength are adiabatically switched on  @xcite , the retrieved light pulse will not propagate out of the atomic ensemble .",
    "instead , it stops in the media and forms a stationary light pulse , as experimentally demonstrated by bajcsy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . on this basis , together with cold - atom techniques , many applications are proposed , which includes simulation of the dynamics of massive schrdinger particles  @xcite , of dirac particles  @xcite , and of the strong correlated bose system confined in a hollow core fiber _ etc .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic equations describing the behavior of the recreated light in @xmath0-type atoms contain infinite - order terms . in conventional theoretical treatment , secular approximation is used and only the zeroth - order coefficient of the ground - spin / optical coherence is kept  @xcite . in hot atomic systems like in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a treatment is reasonable , since the higher - order terms decay very fast due to the random atomic motions and collisions .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations are strongly suppressed in cold atoms , and thus higher - order terms decay much slower and should be considered .",
    "the light generation in cold atomic ensembles has been theoretically studied beyond the secular approximation by hansen _",
    "et al . _",
    "they came to the conclusion that , when the decay rate of the ground - spin / optical coherence is zero , the generated light is a pure stationary light pulse - i.e .",
    ", a stationary light without photon loss .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite took into account the relaxation of the upper state and demonstrated that , under the slow - light condition , the generated light is a stationary light pulse but with some photon loss .",
    "nevertheless , a recent experiment demonstrated  @xcite that , in laser - cooled cold atomic ensembles , the retrieved light pulse is not stationary but splits into two propagating wave packets .",
    "the authors gave a simple model which only involves the zeroth - order and first - order coefficients . since there is no obvious reason why the cutoff should take place at the first - order term , our original minor motivation was to deal with the dynamic equations to a higher order .",
    "it turns out that , in the zero - decay limit and under adiabatic approximation , the dynamic equations can be analytically treated to any order as one wishes ( see appendix for details ) . indeed , to the first order , one obtains two counter - propagating light pulses , consistent with ref .",
    "however , as higher - order terms gradually come in , the relative group velocity of the two light pulses decreases and vanishes as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the highest order of term in the calculation .",
    "it seems to confirm the results in refs .",
    "given this discrepancy and the potential important applications of the stationary light pulse in cold atoms , a careful and systematic study seems desirable .    in this paper",
    ", we directly simulate the dynamic equations ( given in sec .",
    "ii ) to avoid further approximation . for a given set of parameters , a series of simulations",

    "we assume the two ground states are degenerate , and the probe light and control light are on resonance @xmath19 . with slowly varying atomic operators",
    "@xmath20 the langevin equations governing the atomic dynamics read as @xcite @xmath21 where we have set @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this approximation is appropriate since the probe field is very weak and all the atoms are initially prepared in @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the decay of the optical coherence , and @xmath26 is the langevin force .",
    "the counter - propagating control light can be described by @xmath27 , where the light is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "the probe light can also be decomposed into two counter - propagating components as @xmath28 following the standard procedure  @xcite , we define ground - spin coherence as @xmath29 and optical coherence as @xmath30 , and expand them as @xmath31 inserting eqs.([probe])-([expansion2 ] ) into eqs.([bloch1 ] ) and ( [ bloch2 ] ) and assuming @xmath32 , we obtain a set of dynamic equations as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 represents the decay of @xmath37th - order coefficient .",
    "we have also neglected the langevin force terms since they do not play a role in the long - time behavior of the light pulse .",
    "the dynamics of the probe light is governed by the maxwell equations @xmath38    for warm atomic vapors , the random motions and collisions of atoms result in a very rapid decay of spatial coherence .",
    "effectively , one has @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . in this case ,",
    "multiple components @xmath42(@xmath43 ) of ground - spin coherence are suppressed , the same applies to @xmath44(@xmath45 ) .",

    "thus , the multiple components can be populated and preserve their coherence  @xcite , and secular approximation is no longer valid . nevertheless , after adiabatic elimination , one can analytically solve the eqs.([infinite1])([max2 ] ) with @xmath46 ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the group velocity @xmath47 of the forward ( backward)-propagating light pulse is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",

    "since the real system corresponds to the infinite - order limit , one  seems \" to conclude that the recreated light forms a stationary pulse .    for cold atomic systems where temperature is low but nonzero , one has @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath41 . in this case , we set @xmath56 , with @xmath57 the decay constant .",
    "this decay model can well describe the decays of the coefficients of the ground - spin / optical coherence in various cold atomic systems .",

    "in summary , using direct simulation of the dynamic equations for @xmath0-type atomic systems , we find that both the decay rate @xmath2 and the length @xmath1 of the stored wave packet play an important role in determining the behavior of the new light generated by two counter - propagating control lights with equal strength .",
