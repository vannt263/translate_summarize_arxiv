    "the last update to the wind profile of uranus was assembled by @xcite from intensive observations carried out near the time of the 2007 equinox of uranus .",

    "these data sets provided evidence for a small asymmetry in the zonal wind profile , but no substantial evidence for any systematic long - term temporal variation that might be associated with seasonal variations .",
    "the 2007 observations finally were able to detect cloud features up to 70n , and obtained precise wind measurements up to 62n ( planetocentric ) latitude , for the first time showing the beginnings of a northern prograde jet peak with a speed near 250 m / s .    since 2007",
    "the north polar region of uranus has become much better exposed to view as the sub - solar latitude has moved to 14n during the 2011 opposition .",
    "this gave us a chance to better determine the zonal wind profile in the northern hemisphere and provide a much better characterization of the prograde jet .",
    "in the following we describe the post equinox observations that we used to better define the circulation of uranus , the measurement results from each data set , new views of the north polar region of uranus and the different styles of discrete cloud features located there , and finally we describe altitude constraints on a subset of these features .",

    "the november 2009 hst observations do provide temporal sampling adequate to obtain precise wind measurements , although the number of cloud targets contained in these images is small because of limited spatial resolution and inherently low contrast of cloud features at the observed wavelengths .",
    "( longer wavelengths of higher contrast were not used because the required wfc3 ir camera has a much coarser pixel scale of 0.13 arcseconds / pixel . )",
    "the hst imaging program was designed to achieve high s / n ratios to compensate for the inherently low contrast of the images , which made it possible to obtain 6 wind vectors with an accuracy of 3 - 12 m / s , and one with an accuracy of 33 m / s @xcite .",
    "the 3 and 4 june 2010 hst observations provide complete longitude coverage , but detected only a single discrete cloud feature near 29n , and did not provide temporal sampling adequate to determine an accurate wind vector .",

    "[ fig : penprof ] .",
    "most of our post equinox observations are derived from data sets designed to provide high s / n images .",
    "the potential of this approach , and results obtained from 2009 hst wfc3 imaging , are described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , the approach is to take exposures short enough to avoid significant smear due to planetary rotation during the exposure , then average eight or more exposures together on a latitude - longitude grid to remove the effects of planetary rotation .",
    "near the limb of the planet , images with better views are given greater weight : we required the view angle cosine to be greater than 0.025 and weighted each point by the square of the cosine .",
    "this averaging process allows the detection of more subtle cloud features than would otherwise be possible .",
    "sample results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kecksn ] , where a single h image ( a ) is compared with an 8-image average ( b , c ) . little difference is seen in the direct images because the latitudinal variations in brightness are far greater than the noise levels in both images .",
    "but when the large - scale latitudinal variations are removed by subtracting a 15-pixel @xmath2 15-pixel boxcar smoothed version of each image , the improved s / n level of the averaged image becomes quite obvious , as well as the improved visibility of subtle details in the cloud structure .",
    "the measured central - disk noise level of the single image is about 0.44% of signal , and improves to about 0.17% in the 8-image average .",
    "this improvement is about a factor of 2.6 , which is slightly below the factor of 2.83 ( @xmath3 ) expected for completely random noise .        except for the image s / n enhancement described above and in more detail by @xcite",
    ", image processing and navigation followed the same procedures described by @xcite .",
    "we used standard 1-bar polar and equatorial radii of 24,973 km and 25,559 km respectively , and a longitude system based on a 17.24-hour rotation period @xcite .",
    "initially , wind vectors were obtained via manual tracking of discrete cloud features in high - pass filtered images , following the same general approach described by @xcite .",
    "measurements of longitude and latitude vs. time were fit to straight lines using both unweighted regressions .",
    "we used the weighted fit for the wind estimate and the larger of weighted and unweighted error estimates for the assigned error .",
    "errors in latitude and longitude were initially computed assuming an angular error of 0.6 image pixels , based on @xcite .",
    "these estimated errors vary with view angle and position on the disk , and are important when the number of target measurements is small .",
    "but when the number of samples is large , the rms deviation of the measurements from a straight line fit is a better measure of the errors , as it includes both navigation errors as well as target measurement errors .",
    "we find that tracking errors are generally larger in longitude than in latitude because cloud brightness gradients are generally much larger along meridians than along lines of constant latitude .",
    "the main exceptions to this rule are the small symmetrical spots seen in the north polar region of uranus .",
    "we also made extensive use of maximum correlation tracking to try to increase the number of cloud targets and to reduce the errors in defining their positions . to implement this approach we displayed an image sequence as a stacked series of narrow horizontal strips , each containing an orthogonal projection covering a specified range of longitudes and a narrow range of latitudes .",
    "for each cloud target visible in the selected latitude range , a reference image is selected and a target box is adjusted in size and position so that it contains the cloud feature and a small region outside of it .",
    "target boxes in other images are initially positioned using the 2007 wind measurements , then manually adjusted in images in which the default position fails to contain the target feature .",
    "the positions of the target boxes in all but the reference image are then automatically refined to maximize the cross correlation between the reference target box signal variations and those contained in each of the other boxes . to reduce the impact of large - scale variations such as produced by latitude bands , we use high - pass filters or median image subtraction .",
    "the correlation tracking usually takes a few iterations to achieve convergence .",
    "this procedure facilitated the identification of more cloud targets , as well as providing generally more accurate tracking results than purely manual measurements .",
    "for compact bright features of relatively high contrast we also found it sometimes useful for cloud tracking to use the center - of - differential brightness coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are given by the sums @xmath6/\\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\sum_{i , j}^{target }    [ i(i , j)-i_b(i , j)]\\\\ y_{cdb } = \\sum_{i , j}^{target }    y_j\\cdot[i(i , j)-i_b(i , j)]/\\\\ \\nonumber \\sum_{i , j}^{target }    [ i(i , j)-i_b(i , j)]\\label{eq : cdb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the reflectivity at image location @xmath8 , @xmath9 is either the smoothed reflectivity or the median filtered image reflectivity , and the summation is over the area of the target box .",
    "what we see in the filtered or subtracted images is @xmath10 rather than @xmath11 .      in our july 2011 keck nirc2 images we were able to identify 21 targets suitable for tracking the winds of uranus .",
    "most of these were only trackable within a single transit on 26 july 2011 , when weather and seeing conditions did not severely impact the nirc2 images . on the 27th ,",
    "turbulence increased significantly during the second half of the night , when our observations were taken , and seeing reached extremely poor levels up to several arc seconds fwhm , at which point the ao system image quality deteriorates drastically .",
    "poor seeing was also the rule on 28 july , although it was highly variable and a few usable images were obtained .",
    "but it was only the 26 july images that could be combined together to produce enhanced signal - to - noise ratios , which facilitated tracking of small low - contrast cloud features .",
    "even the 26 july images were far below the excellent quality frequently obtained in prior observations , and thus it was not surprising that the expected bounty of low contrast features implied by the proof - of - concept image of @xcite did not materialize .",
    "not only was seeing below par ( rapidly varying from 0.6@xmath0 to 1.2@xmath0 and beyond ) , but psf characteristics ( unusual wing structure not normally visible ) suggested that the ao system might have been out of adjustment as well ( this was later confirmed during the november observing run of de pater and hammel ) . nevertheless , our imaging program design partially compensated for these problems .",
    "we were able to make a significant improvement in the definition of the northern hemisphere prograde jet , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : keckwinds ] . the wind accuracy we obtained for targets we could track was quite impressive , often reaching uncertainties below 10 m / s .",
    "these new manual tracking results are roughly consistent with the 10-term legendre polynomial fit of @xcite , which is based on wind measurements acquired during the intensive observing period near the 2007 equinox .",
    "we also obtained excellent views of high northern latitudes that we present in a later section .    .",

    "[ fig : asymm ] .",
    "the new fits are more symmetric than prior fits , and the fit that is constrained to be symmetric is very close to the northern hemisphere fit of the complete fit because there are more points in the northern hemisphere . however , though the addition of new observations makes the entire data set somewhat more symmetric , the remaining asymmetry is better defined .",
    "it is not clear whether the true asymmetry of the zonal winds has changed slightly or whether the new observations are just sampling a different statistical variation in target motions .",
    "the better definition of asymmetry obtained from the larger combined data set depends on the earlier observations , which are better distributed in latitude and contribute more measurements in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the large berg feature is responsible for many of those observations ; as it traveled from 33 - 34s to 8s @xcite , it provided samples of drift rates within that range , though unfortunately sampled too sparsely to provide a detailed profile .",
    "it is clear that because high - accuracy winds do not always represent the mean zonal flow with similar accuracy , the asymmetry information in a sparsely sampled data set can easily be misleading . with large numbers of samples , which we obtained by combining all observations from 1997 onward ,",
    "this is less of a concern . by combining observations between 1997 and 2005 with those up to 2011",
    ", we are not too far from representing the circulation pattern near the 2007 equinox ( the mean year of these observations is @xmath122006 ) . if the asymmetry is actually a long - delayed seasonal effect ( with a phase shift near 90 ) , then it should be reflected about the equator at the prior equinox , and near the midpoint of the transition in 1986 , when voyager observations were made .",
    "however , as shown by the voyager results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymm]b ( open circles ) it does not appear that the 1986 voyager measurements are measurably different from our grand average profile , nor from the 2007 equinox results alone @xcite .",
    "this further enhances the probability that the asymmetry may be a relatively stable feature over a long period , perhaps more than a uranian year . while this seems to violate our expectations of symmetry in the annual average ( over the uranian year ) ,",
    "there are other examples of persistent asymmetry in zonal circulation profiles , namely those of jupiter and saturn .",
    "there are alternative interpretations , however , for the lack of change in asymmetry of the wind profile .",
    "for example , if the phase shift is closer to 45and had a sinusoidal variation , then the asymmetry be be the same at both equinox and solstice , with maxima in between .",
    "another possibility is that the symmetry variation does not proceed in a uniform or sinusoidal fashion , but achieves most of the change by the solstice , and changes little between solstice and the next equinox .",
    "further observations over many years will be required to distinguish these possibilities .",
    "the 2011 keck observations provided the best views to date of the north polar region of uranus .",
    "this is best illustrated by polar stereographic projections of the northern hemisphere that we assembled from 85 images taken on 26 july 2011 and 4 images from 27 july 2011 .",
    "to combine together images taken at different times during the rotation of the planet we had to account for the advection of features by the zonal wind over the time interval between images .",
    "this is a significant effect within the north polar jet , where wind speeds exceed 250 m / s and longitudinal drift rates exceed 5/hour . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarcomp1 ] we display two polar stereographic projections , one with the image brightness proportional to i / f ( left ) and the same image with a 25-pixel box car smoothed image subtracted ( right ) . in the left hand image latitudinal variations in brightness are much larger than variations due to local cloud features , while in the high - pass filtered version , the local cloud features are revealed in striking detail .",
    "the stretch used in the filtered image is just -20 to 40 dn , while in the unfiltered image it is 2000 - 5000 dn , a factor of 50:1 .",
    "thus the small cloud features visible in the filtered image produce brightness variations that are only a few percent as large as the latitudinal variations .",
    "the distribution of the small bright features is relatively uniform over the upper left quadrant of the polar mosaic .",
    "the decline in numbers of bright features in the other quadrants may simply be a result of fewer images contributing there .",
    "these are also regions where the shape of discrete features becomes more distorted by shear in the wind profile .",
    "the real features do nt get sheared , but the zonal wind shift application causes an artificial distortion that will reduce contrast .",
    "the importance of shifting image pixels to account for the zonal wind profile is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarcomp2 ] , where the left mosaic was assembled with no wind shift , while the right was assembled with the nominal wind shift ( the 13-term fit in table  [ tbl : legfits ] for the 1997 - 2011 observations ) .",
    "polar projections of gemini - north images are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gempole ] , which shows a 33-image average for the h filter and a 64-image combination for the hcont filter on 26 october 2011 .",
    "both filters show the same discrete feature structure in the polar regions , but not as fine a detail as displayed by the keck polar composite .",
    "thus , each feature in the gemini composite is likely a blurred mix of several features of somewhat smaller scale .",
    "both filters display the same pattern of features , proving that they are not due to random noise fluctuations . applying the same technique to gemini niri images",
    "obtained on 25 october revealed no discrete polar features .",
    "although we had only 19 h images and 18 hcont images to combine for that day , the lack of features is more likely due to the lower seeing quality . on 25 october ,",
    "the natural seeing ( given by the header keyword aoseeing ) was generally in the 0.5 - 1 arcsecond range , while on 26 october , the seeing was much more stable and for almost every image was below 0.4 arcseconds .",
    "although the 26 july 2011 keck seeing was worse , generally in the 0.6 - 1.2 arcsecond range ( at 0.5 ) , the ability of the keck ao system to use the planet as a wavefront reference ( vmag=5.5 ) instead of a satellite ( vmag=13.7 - 14.2 ) allowed it to produce more detailed images than was possible with the gemini ao system under superb natural seeing conditions .",
    "another virtue of the keck ao system is that ao correction deteriorates with angular distance from the wavefront reference to the target @xcite , which is generally larger for a satellite than for the planet itself .          while the polar projection image is dominated by zonal bands and zonally streaked features south of about 60n , at higher latitudes the dominant feature style is small bright spots and a smaller number of small dark spots .",
    "this morphology is similar to what is seen at high polar latitudes on saturn @xcite , where such features were likened to terrestrial cumulus convective clouds .",
    "a cassini image of saturn s north polar region , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : saturn ] , bears a striking resemblance to the north polar region of uranus , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarcomp2 ] . on saturn",
    ", both polar regions can display these features at the same time , even when the two polar regions are in opposite seasons . in january 2009 , which was close enough to saturn s august 2009 equinox that both polar regions were partially illuminated , cassini took images ( pia10583 and pia10585 ) revealing small scattered bright spots in both the spring - time ( north ) polar region and in the fall ( south ) polar region .",
    "uranus polar regions , on the other hand , are very asymmetric , as will be shown in the next section .        while the uranian features bear a superficial resemblance to fair weather cumulus cloud fields on earth , the scale is much larger .",
    "the spacing between the uranus polar features is typically 5 - 10 in longitude and 3 - 5 in latitude .",
    "the typical size of the cloud elements is 1 in latitude and 3 in longitude .",
    "the latitudinal extent of the features corresponds to a physical distance of @xmath13450 km .",
    "the saturnian features are typically somewhat smaller ( @xmath13200 km ) .",
    "the optical depth of uranian bright cloud features is not well known , and how much less optical depth is present in the dark regions is completely unknown .",
    "the fact that none of these features is visible in k@xmath14 images , means that they are deeper than the methane condensation level near 1.2 bars , which is confirmed in a later section by comparison of h and hcont images .",
    "the few bright polar features we could analyze do not appear to be optically thick , making it less likely that they are deep convective features . on the other hand , it is possible that our images have not resolved these features , which would reduce their apparent i / f values and their apparent optical depths .",
    "the saturnian features appear very opaque in 5-images , implying that they are optically thick .",
    "although post - voyager imaging has failed to reveal any discrete clouds in the south polar region of uranus , there remained a small possibility that subtle features were present but not seen because of insufficient s / n .",
    "to address that issue we gathered high quality images from 2003 , and formed a south polar mosaic using the same wind shift approach used for the north polar mosaic . while we did nt have as many images to work with , the quality of individual images was generally higher because the ao system was better adjusted and the seeing may have been better .",
    "the result for mosaicking the three h images from 4 october is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : southpole ] . in the overlap region where all three images contribute to reduce noise levels ( roughly a 100region centered at 7 oclock )",
    ", there is no indication of any discrete cloud feature standing above the noise level .",
    "this should be compared to the north polar mosaic displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarcomp1 ] .",
    "there is certainly no feature in the south polar region with the contrast found in the north polar region in 2011 .",
    "instead , the south polar region seems devoid of discrete cloud features , but has ( or at least had in 2003 ) a banded structure that is currently not seen in the north polar region .",
    "a south polar mosaic created without accounting for zonal wind shift produced an image that is virtually identical to the one produced with the wind shift .",
    "neither showed any small discrete features .",
    "even better views of the south polar region , provided by hst images from 1994 - 2000 @xcite , also failed to reveal any discrete polar cloud features .    although the observed polar asymmetry on uranus might be unrelated to seasonal forcing , as perhaps is the case for the wind asymmetry , a seasonal cause for the polar asymmetry is certainly the most plausible .",
    "if it is a seasonal effect , then a few years after the next equinox , when the south polar region will again come into view , we would expect it to look like the north polar region looks now , and just before that equinox we would expect the north polar region to be devoid of discrete cloud features . as we continue to observe the north polar region for the next four decades , at some point",
    "the convective activity should stop , and a polar cloud cap should form @xcite . exactly when these transitions will take place and what detailed mechanisms are involved in this expected response to seasonal forcing remain to be determined .        the dramatically different appearance of the two polar regions of uranus is a possible indication of different stability structures of the atmospheres .",
    "@xcite reported reduced methane mixing ratio at high southern latitudes , based on 2002 stis spectra .",
    "this finding was confirmed by @xcite , who also found the depletion to be relatively shallow ( only down to a few bars ) .",
    "these results suggested a meridional flow of gas from low latitudes upward through the methane condensation level , where condensation reduces the methane mixing ratio , transport of that depleted gas to high latitudes , and then descent of the depleted gas , which reduces the average methane mixing ratio to the observed levels .",
    "such a circulation would tend to suppress convection in the region of down - welling gas , which is consistent with the absence of any discrete convective features in the south polar region in 2003 .",
    "although this is suggestive , the real reason for lack of convection in the south might be due to increased thermal stability produced by some other mechanism that alters the thermal structure in this region , which itself might have a seasonal origin .",
    "it is worth noting that there are occasions when convective storms can occur in regions of general downwelling . on jupiter , for example , thunderstorms occur primarily in belts @xcite .",
    "the meridional flow suggested above for the upper troposphere , is opposite to the direction of heat transport required to reduce the temperature difference between equator and pole .",
    "according to @xcite , the average annual solar energy absorbed by the poles exceeds that absorbed at the equator , and radiative convective models suggest that the poles should be @xmath136 k warmer than the equator , which significantly exceeds the @xmath15 k obtained with meridional transports included .",
    "if northern poleward meridional transport of methane is occurring in the upper troposphere and southward transport is occurring somewhat deeper , that suggests that most of the heat transport is occurring in the return flow .",
    "but deeper still , another poleward transport is suggested by microwave observations down to the 50-bar level @xcite , where microwave absorbing gases ( nh@xmath16 and h@xmath17s ) seem to be symmetrically depleted in both polar regions .",
    "an estimate of the pressure levels of many of the discrete cloud features can be made using the ratio of spatial modulations in h and hcont filters , as employed in the simplest form by @xcite and in a somewhat more exact form by @xcite .",
    "these two filters not only have different penetration depth profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : penprof ] ) over a useful pressure range , but they also have sufficiently similar effective wavelengths that we can ignore wavelength dependent differences in seeing or effective spatial resolution , which can distort the observed modulation ratios and the inferred cloud pressures . the similarity in spatial resolution is only valid if the seeing is stable over the time span covered by the h and hcont images .",
    "[ fig : penprof ] displays the i / f obtained when a unit - albedo surface is placed at different depths within a model aerosol - free uranus atmosphere . for a given filter , the apparent ( externally viewed ) i / f of a unit albedo surface at pressure p",
    "approaches its asymptotic value as p becomes arbitrarily large ( which yields the same i / f as for a clear atmosphere ) at a rate that depends on the degree of absorption within the filter band .",
    "the i / f difference from the asymptotic value indicates how sensitive the filter is to spatial modulations in cloud reflectivity or amount as a function of where they occur in pressure . in the simplest case of a small isolated cloud feature",
    ", the modulation can be thought of as simply the difference between the peak i / f of a cloud feature and the i / f of its surroundings .",
    "the useful pressure range for h and hcont is between 300 mb and 4 - 5 bars , between which the i / f differences in h decline more rapidly with pressure than the i / f differences in hcont .",
    "the ratio of h modulations to hcont modulation thus provides a measure of the pressure location of the modulations .    in applying the spatial modulation technique to our observations",
    ", we followed @xcite in calculating model ratios for middle latitudes for an array of cloud pressures and view angles including the effects of the main cloud layer between 1.2 and 2 bars @xcite .",
    "the discrete cloud is treated as a physically thin perturbation inserted into the background structure .",
    "both the background and discrete perturbations are modeled as conservative mie particle layers of 0.8 in radius with a refractive index of 1.3 .",
    "an effective pressure for the discrete cloud can be inferred from the ratio of spatial modulations in i / f ( see fig . 15 of sromovsky et al .",

    "following the 2007 equinox , new circulation measurements were obtained from imaging observations by hst in 2009 , by keck in july 2011 , and by gemini - north in october 2011 .",
    "the new imaging programs used repeated short exposures followed by averaging in latitude - longitude projections to increase signal to noise ratios so that low contrast cloud features could be detected and tracked .",
    "application of high s / n imaging and analysis techniques @xcite to 2011 observations of uranus using gemini and keck telescopes resulted in detection of many trackable cloud features even under less than ideal observing conditions ( for keck ) and less than ideal ao references ( for gemini ) .",
    "the 2011 observations , which provide better views of uranus north polar region , have enabled more accurate measurements of the zonal winds at high latitudes . using 2011 keck images in july and gemini images in october , we made measurements of cloud motions using a variety of methods , using manual tracking and guided correlation tracking , as well as using high - pass filtered images to enhance small discrete features and median differenced images to enhance larger discrete features , which often appear at low latitudes .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "zonal winds measured in 2009 and 2011 are roughly consistent with the 10-term legendre polynomial fit to 2007 observations @xcite , but deviate in a direction that provides somewhat better agreement with the profile reflected about the equator , which is in the direction of reducing hemispheric asymmetry , although this is not yet statistically significant .",
    "the best high latitude results were obtained from keck 2011 imagery , and clearly define a prograde jet peak near 260 m / s at a planetographic latitude near 60n .",
    "cloud motions in the north polar region , from the jet peak northward , appear most consistent with solid body rotation at a rate of 4.3/h westward relative to the interior .",
    "the voyager wind measurement at 71s ( the only south polar measurement ) is consistent with the same rotation period .",
    "using manually guided correlation measurements , we obtained several high accuracy measurements of near equatorial ( between 2 and 3n ) drift rates averaging 0.52@xmath10.02/h eastward in 2011 ; this corresponds to a retrograde wind speed of 64@xmath12 m / s , which is in close agreement with new measurements in 2003 keck images obtained by @xcite .",
    "the near - equatorial features ( 2 - 4n ) are broad and diffuse , and form a pattern consistent with a wavenumber of 9 ( 40spacing in longitude ) , suggesting that the measured motions might differ from the mean mass flow .",
    "the 2011 pattern is not complete , however , and thus the @xcite wavenumber 12 pattern ( also incomplete but better constrained ) might be consistent with our results .",
    "when 2011 observations are combined with 2009 hst wind results of @xcite , the resulting fits provide less asymmetry at high latitudes than found by @xcite , mainly because of better constraints obtained from high - latitude measurements . for this data",
    "set , the difference in fit quality between symmetric and asymmetric fits is statistically insignificant . 7 .",
    "when combined with past observations from 1997 onward , which provides better sampling at southern mid latitudes , we find a small but well defined asymmetry at middle latitudes , extending from about 15to 40 .",
    "longitudinal drift rates at 35n differ from drift rates at 35s by an average of 0.2/h eastward , which corresponds to a wind speed difference of 20 m / s .",
    "there is no substantial evidence regarding symmetry properties at high latitudes , primarily due to a lack of samples in the southern hemisphere .",
    "voyager 1986 wind measurements do not differ significantly from the zonal wind profile established by 1997 - 2011 observations , raising the possibility that the asymmetry at the most recent equinox is a long - term feature of uranus circulation , or that the asymmetry has a phase shift relative to seasonal forcing that is less than 90 , or that the asymmetry response function is itself asymmetric , with perhaps most of the asymmetry reversal occurring early in the seasonal cycle .",
    "these possibilities can be distinguished by measurements between now and the next solstice in 2030 .",
    "high accuracy wind measurements at nearby latitudes often differ by far more than their estimated uncertainties , which might be a result of different atmospheric depths , latitude differences between the generating circulation feature and the observed cloud feature , and possible long - period eddy motions .",
    "the morphology of cloud features in the north polar region in 2011 is very different from the south polar region observed in 2003 .",
    "although the south polar region was devoid of discrete cloud features , the north polar region ( north of 60n ) contains small bright ( but low contrast cloud features ) , widely distributed and reminiscent of fair - weather cumulus cloud fields on earth , though on a much larger scale , with features approximately 450 km in size , and spaced roughly 1500 - 3000 km apart .",
    "this morphology , which resembles saturn s polar regions , is distinct from lower latitudes , where the predominant morphology consists of zonal bands with longitudinally stretched streaky cloud features , and not widely distributed .",
    "the north polar region was also found to have small dark spots comparable in size to the small bright features , but considerably less numerous .",
    "where s / n ratios permitted measurement we determined that high latitude bright cloud features were located at pressures at 1.5 bars or deeper , with the most accurate estimates between 1.4 and 2 bars , which is within the main background cloud layer observed on uranus .",
    "cloud pressures inferred from spatial modulations in h and hcont images near the equator were between 1.5 and 2 bars , as were many clouds at northern mid latitudes . 14 .",
    "a few of the brighter cloud features were found to be close to or above the methane condensation level , the highest being the bs1 feature described by @xcite , which reached an estimated pressure near 400 mb .",
    "the cloud pressure and optical depth estimates could be improved in several ways .",
    "the first is to compute model ratios for background models that vary in latitude as needed to reproduce the background i / f , instead of using the mid - latitude calculations .",
    "the second , which applies to the existing observations , is to determine a more accurate relative measurement of the central disk i / f of uranus in h and hcont spectral filters , then apply that calibration to the existing observations .",
    "a third improvement could be obtained by improving the s / n ratio of the hcont measurement , which will require new measurements .",
    "the high s / n methods applied to keck imaging observations will likely yield even better results with better seeing conditions and a well adjusted ao system . according to the test case of @xcite",
