    "while the first half of the xix century saw triumphal discoveries in physics , ranging from quantum mechanics and general relativity up to the discovery of chaos , the second half has been probably dragged by biology : among its several fields of investigation , immunology ( both theoretical and experimental ) is currently one of the most intensive and promising .",
    "( adaptive ) immune systems are networks of lymphocytes exchanging chemical signals and proteins as cytokines or antibodies . in a nutshell ,",
    "the main constituents of the immune system are the effector branches ( made of by b cells and killer cells ) and the helper cells @xcite .",
    "b cells produce antibodies and are grouped into clones : each cell belonging to a given clone produces the same antibody , while different clones produce different antibodies . when a pathogen , e.g. a virus , enters the body , the clone producing the best matching antibody undergoes clonal expansion and secretes the antibody able to chemically bind the pathogen hence ( possibly ) avoiding the propagation of the infection .",
    "if the virus has already infected a host cell , the latter is killed ( e.g. via lysis ) by killer cells and order is restored .",
    "actually , responses by effector branches can take place only if another signal ( beyond the presence of the antigen ) occurs .",
    "this signal is promoted by helpers which coordinate / modulate the response by exchanging with the effector branches both eliciting ( e.g. the interleukin-@xmath0 cytokine ) and suppressive messages ( e.g. the interleukin-@xmath1 cytokine ) . given the large amount of its constituents ( e.g. the complete b - repertoire in humans is estimated to range in @xmath2 clones ) and the interest in understanding global  collective \" features of the immune system thought of  as a whole \" , scientists are becoming attracted towards the potentiality of statistical - mechanics approaches even in this branch of theoretical biology ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , a theoretical motivation for the use of canonical disordered statistical mechanics in biological world is not so obvious as biological systems are not isolated , and the blind application of the second law of thermodynamics locally may be debatable .",
    "one can argue a sort of  local - reductionism \" : despite within the host all networks ( e.g. neural , endocrine , immune , etc ) interact synergically , as a first approximation they can be considered independently ( as in the approach paved in neural networks @xcite ) and the cells building the system retain only their peculiar function ( as for instance firing / not - firing a spike in the neural scenario , or secreting / not - secreting antibodies for the b - cells in the present context ) .",
    "furthermore , one may escape theoretical justification showing accordance with data and noticing that the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( at least for linear forces , namely quadratic hamiltonians ) coincides with the prediction of the maximum entropy models in statistical inference @xcite , widely used for fitting procedure without paying attention to the whole scaffold offered by statistical mechanics .    with this premise",
    "we continue the investigation of a model introduced in @xcite and meant to capture , as emergent features , some collective properties of the immune system .",
    "the model is based on spin - glasses @xcite and their equivalence with information processing systems @xcite as bolzmann machines and neural networks .",
    "more precisely , the interactions between helper cells and b - cells via cytokines ( which are both eliciting or suppressive ) is shown to give rise to an effective hebbian structure among helpers alone , in which they are able to develop  strategies \" to coordinate properly the effector branches @xcite .",
    "interestingly , bypassing the previous mean - field approximation , where each helper interacts with each b - clone , toward a description where each helper interacts only with a fraction of the available repertoire of b - cells , which is a biological must , cells act on helpers as antigen presenting cells and this requires mhc - ii : antigen to bind properly with the tcr available from the helper ensemble , on the other hand , helper cells act on b cells via cytokine exchanges which are diffusive and short - ranged ] makes the  cognitive capabilities \" of the helpers able to manage parallel processing .",
    "this means that helpers succeed in performing multiple retrievals ( i.e. , strategies , instructions for the b - cells ) at the same time , without falling into spurious states ( i.e. errors ) typical of the underlying glassy nature of neural networks .",
    "this is an important step forward toward a rationale understanding of the systemic properties of immune networks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath3 we review the minimal , fully - connected model previously introduced in @xcite , while in sec .",
    "@xmath4 we explain how dilution is introduced and we scaffold the statistical - mechanics analysis , then , in sec .",
    "@xmath0 we study in details the parallel retrieval performed by the system and in sec .",
    "@xmath5 we give some insights in the numerical methods exploited ; finally , sec .",
    "@xmath6 is left for discussions on results and on future perspectives .",
    "in this section we briefly review the minimal model we introduced in @xcite for the core of the immune system . as in the original model",
    "there is full symmetry between the two effector branches @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in the following we consider only the b - branch . at equilibrium , when no external antigens are present and neglecting second order subtleties as auto - activation due to jerne cascades @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "@xmath9 ) , the system is built by @xmath10 different helper clones and @xmath7 different b - cell clones .",
    "each b - cell clone , say the @xmath11 , is associated to a degree of activation , referred to as @xmath12 , which represents the extent of the clonal size with respect to a given equilibrium value .",
    "setting , without loss of generality , the equilibrium value equal to zero for all clones @xmath13 , we have that @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) means that the clone has expanded ( shrunk ) . due to fluctuations , memory effects and noise , overall the distribution of the clonal activations for the effector branches @xmath16 is assumed as a central gaussian @xmath17 $ ] , in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "interactions among b - cells ( which are not treated here ) exist too and , roughly speaking , work through a complementary affinity exchange such that if a b - cell ( belonging to a clonal lineage ) produces the antibody @xmath18 in some epitopal alphabet ( see for instance the phase shape of @xcite or the interaction matrix of @xcite ) , its antibody can be recognized by the cells ( clonal lineage ) producing the anti - antibody @xmath19 or very similar variants . as a consequence , cells belonging to the same clone",
    "do not interact directly and there is no intra - clonal cooperative response to an external stimulus such as an antigenic attack .",
    "this would lead to a michaelis - menten @xcite@xcite behavior of the b - cell response . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall bell - shaped response @xcite is the result of extra - clonal cooperative interactions and of interactions with helper cells ( through cytokines ) .    as for helpers ,",
    "the situation is quite different because they interact each others via cytokine signalling @xcite which is non - specific , so that intra - clonal response can be highly cooperative @xcite@xcite , such that for its high values , e.g. @xmath20 there is a strong sigmoidal shape in the response : the system shows unresponsiveness to small stimuli while it is maximally responding once the stimulus reaches a threshold and stay stable beyond . ] .",
    "thus , the activity @xmath21 can be better approximated by a step function ( a steep hyperbolic tangent ) , which can be seen as a digital switch w.r.t the b kinetics .",
    "consequently , we define their status ( active / inactive ) as a binary ising spin such that if @xmath22 the @xmath11 clone is quiescent , while if @xmath23 it is firing , namely secreting cytokines @xcite which would clarify the cytokine loops inside helpers and we neglected further the `` hierarchical '' strength of various cytokines @xcite ( e.g. interferons usually induce stronger responses w.r.t .",
    "interleukins ) assuming all the chemical signals as equivalent and loosing a more complex alphabet for chemical messengers . ] .",
    "as cytokines may have either positive ( expansion ) and negative ( suppression ) signs , we model the system of b and h interactions as a bipartite spin glass admitting the hamiltonian representation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cytokine connecting the @xmath11 helper clone with the @xmath26 b - clone . hence ,",
    "overall , @xmath27 cytokines have to be defined .",
    "the partition function @xmath28 of this system can be written as @xmath29.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath30 ( in the following rescaled into @xmath31 ) rules the level of noise in the network , while the ratio @xmath32 accounts for the difference in clonal sizes between helpers and b - cells , in the limit of large sizes .",
    "interestingly , the complex interactions between helpers and b - cells are absorbed , via marginalization , within a two - body hamiltonian @xmath33 , which turns out to be equivalent to the hamiltonian of the hopfield model which functions as an associative memory @xcite . here ,",
    "neurons are replaced by helper lymphocytes and the memorized ",
    "patterns of information \" correspond to particular strategies , encoded by cytokine secretions , for the b - cells . in the following",
    "we will refer to the generic element @xmath34 as lymphocyte , spin or neuron , indifferently . as well known from neural network theory @xcite",
    ", this system may show cooperative cognitive features only if @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a critical value implicitly offering the first global constraint for a correct performance of the immune system : helpers must be more than b - cells ; this is indeed confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "let us now see how the system responds to an external stimulus in the adiabatic limit . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case where all clones are made to expand ; this peculiar situation actually corresponds to a real disease , known as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the partition function @xmath37 , we substitute the centered gaussian weight @xmath38 with @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 being the new reference value of clonal expansion .",
    "it is immediate to check @xcite that when the bipartite spin - glass system is mapped into the neural network counterpart , a new term appears in the resulting ( pseudo)-hamiltonian @xmath33 : @xmath41 with @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "thus , a clonal expansion , which can be thought of as ordered work , implies a production of  heat \" , thought of as a random field ( a noise source ) , which affects helpers performance appears linearly in the  bulk \" term , while under the square root in the noise term , mapping standard propagation of information in the former and random diffusion in the latter . ] . as a consequence , too strong responses ( lymphocytosis )",
    "can be coupled with ( transitive ) autoimmune manifestations because the random fields prevail over retrieval ; this offers a simple theoretical explanation to a common fact .",
    "therefore , the tunable parameters of the system are @xmath31 , @xmath43 and @xmath40 ; according to their mutual values the system described by @xmath44 exhibits different behaviors ( see fig .",
    "@xmath45 ) . in the neural scenario ,",
    "one can outline a region in the parameter space where the system is able to retrieve a given learnt bit - string of information , which corresponds to a particular pattern @xmath46 .",
    "how does this concept translate , in the immunological context ?",
    "this can be understood by introducing the @xmath7 mattis magnetizations @xmath47 , one for each b - clone . if , for example , the pattern of cytokine activation @xmath48 has been retrieved , then @xmath49 , which means that all helper states are parallel to the corresponding cytokines linking them to the first b - clone . as a consequence ,",
    "all the inhibitor signals are absent while all the eliciting signals are present , namely , the assembly of helpers orchestrates the response against the antigen coupled to the first b - clone conferring to the latter the maximal strength for the clonal expansion .",
    "we stress that the hamiltonian @xmath50 shows gauge invariance ( breakable with an external field @xcite , usually thought of as a threshold for firing in neural counterpart ) , which is lost in the bi - layered b - h network . in other words , the marginalizations performed in eqs . @xmath51 and @xmath52 break the symmetry @xmath53 . in fact , the h - h network is left invariant under the transformation @xmath53 for all @xmath54 , while in the b - h network , having fixed the cytokine pattern , the same transformation leads to a change in the field felt by the connected b clones .",
    "[ uovo ]    , @xmath55.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    we finally underline that , within a pure fully - connected approach , each helper clone interacts with the whole b - repertoire , and the assembly for deciding about one single b - clone includes the whole helper ensemble , which are both unrealistic fatures given the huge sizes of such populations and the fact that interactions are essentially local and of diffusive nature . in what follows we remove the hypothesis of a fully - connected by - layered spin - glass network and we allow only a ( small ) fraction of the whole ensemble of helpers to coordinate the response of a given b - clone . as we will show , the resulting associative network made by helpers is able to parallel process , namely to manage several b - clones together at the same time , which is an emergent property much closer to the biological reality .",
    "the purposes of this section is to generalize the original model in two ways .",
    "first , we show that , even including intra - clonal cooperativity among b - cells ( hence for dichotomic variables @xmath56 ) we can still retain , under a suitable expansion , a resulting helper network working as an associative working memory . this extension allows to incorporate even second order effects of clonal interactions in the b - repertoire",
    "previously neglected .",
    "for instance , a virus , e.g. represented by the string of information @xmath57 , yields the clonal expansion of the lineage of b - cells producing the antibody @xmath58 , and this , in turn , will drive the clonal expansion of the lineage of the b - cells producing the anti - antibody @xmath57 ; the latter , resembling ( for receptor binding ) the original virus , could elicit further the expansion of the clone @xmath58 , resulting as a second - order cooperative feedback by the cells within the original clone .",
    "therefore , the gaussian variables for b - cells are replaced by dichotomic ones and we assume here that both @xmath10 lymphocytes @xmath21 and @xmath7 lymphocytes @xmath59 take discrete values @xmath60 , where @xmath61 stands for quiescence while @xmath62 for a firing state ( secretion of cytokines -for the h- or secretion of antibodies -for the b- ) ; in particular , @xmath7 clones are subjected to the following probability distribution : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the kronocker delta function and @xmath65 $ ] , such that for values of @xmath66 , it acts as a bias mimicking the original @xmath40 parameter .    then",
    ", we show how , by properly diluting the bipartite spin - glass by - layer of @xmath7 and @xmath10 cells , the associative helper network becomes able to handle parallel recall of several different patterns ( strategies ) .",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian of this new by - layer in complete analogy with the previous section as @xmath67 when dilution is absent , free energy minimization shows that this hamiltonian , for orthogonal patterns @xmath68 ( which results from uncorrelated distributions in the thermodynamic limit @xmath69 ) , tends to expand the @xmath26 b - clone ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , but it provides the other clones with no net information ( i.e. @xmath71 ) .",
    "conversely , real immune systems are able to address a wide variety of antigens simultaneously managing several clones at the same time and , in this sense , we refer to parallel processing capabilities of the network .",
    "this property can be restated as the ability to have equilibrium states with several mattis magnetizations different from zero , or above the noise level at finite volume , without being spurious states @xcite .",
    "we introduce dilution in the couplings , by writing : _",
    "i = _ i c_i , where @xmath72 assumes values @xmath60 , representing the excitatory or inhibitory quality of the link ( cytokine ) , and @xmath73 assumes values @xmath45 or @xmath74 representing , respectively , existence @xmath75 or absence @xmath76 of the link .",
    "their probability distribution are : @xmath77 where @xmath78 can range continuously in @xmath79 $ ] , allowing some intensive tuning ) ) can be easily relaxed leading to a network with low level of activation and whose properties strongly resemble the standard ones @xcite . ] .",
    "hence , we get the following distribution for @xmath80 : @xmath81 such that for @xmath82 no network exists , while for @xmath83 the hopfield model is recovered",

    "as it is immediate to check , each missing link between the @xmath11 helper cell and the @xmath26 b - cell in the bipartite b - h network appears as a @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath96 in the @xmath11 entry of the bit - string @xmath46 in the equivalent associative network , which ultimately affects the interaction matrix @xmath97 .",
    "of course , the larger the degree of dilution , the stronger the difference between such ( random ) coupling matrix and its hopfield counterpart .",
    "this section is devoted to the investigation of the properties of the matrix @xmath98 .",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath10 nodes labeled as @xmath99 and let us associate to each node a string of length @xmath7 and built from the alphabet @xmath100 , meaning that the generic element @xmath25 , with @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 $ ] , can equal either @xmath60 or @xmath74 .",

    "let us now generalize this discussion by introducing the number of configurations @xmath332 whose overlap with the given pattern displays @xmath333 misalignments in such a way that @xmath332 is given not only by the degeneracy induced by null entries , but also by the degeneracy induced by the choice of @xmath333 entries out of @xmath330 which have to be mismatched .",

    "therefore , we can count the number of configurations @xmath336 exhibiting a number of misalignments , with respect to @xmath189 , up to a given threshold @xmath245 ; in the presence of noise such configurations are all accessible , namely they all lay in the same `` deep '' minimum .",

    "this is a percolation process in the space of configurations .",
    "indeed , similarly to what happens in canonical percolation processes , the curves representing the giant component relevant to different sizes @xmath10 intersect at around @xmath347 , which distinguishes the percolation threshold @xmath348 . according to eq .",

    "in this section we discuss details on monte carlo simulations .",
    "all the simulations have been performed on a system ubuntu linux with intel core i7 , @xmath353ghz , @xmath354 cpu , nvidia - fermi technology , @xmath354 gb ram and openmp libraries .",

    "if the amount of patterns do not exceed @xmath360 , i.e. one byte , it is then possible to account for @xmath361 helpers with no need of swapping on hard disk ( which would sensibly affect the performance of the simulation ) .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for the low storage regime we are interested in",
    ". 2 .   initialize the network status .",
    "+ we checked the two standard approaches : the first is to initialize the network in a ( assumed ) fixed point of the dynamics , namely h_i=_i^1 i and check its evolution : this gives important information on the structure of the basins of attraction of the minima as we vary the dilution ( see point @xmath5 ) .",
    "+ the second approach is to initialize the network randomly : we set @xmath362 with probability @xmath363 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "this is a standard procedure to follow the relaxation to a fixed point with no initial assumption and gives important information on the structure of the basins of attraction of the minima at fixed dilution .",
    "evolution dynamics + the activity of helpers evolves according to a standard ( random and sequential ) glauber dynamics for ising - like systems @xcite : at each time interval , the state of a lymphocyte is updated according to its input signals , where the probability of the unit s activity is equal to a rectified value of the input ( logit transfer function ) , i.e. @xmath364.}\\ ] ] the field - updating process is managed by a linked list whose parsing is parallelized through openmp .",
    "convergence of the simulation .",
    "+ due to the peculiar structure of the fields induced by pattern dilution ( see fig .",
    "@xmath4 , right panel ) , the field insisting on a given helper may be zero and the related spin would flip indefinitely . to avoid this pathological situation",
    "we skip the updating of these `` paramagnetic '' lymphocytes and focus on the remaining ones : in the zero noise limit convergence is almost immediate , such that when the whole ensemble of helpers remains unchanged for the whole @xmath365-length of the update cycle , dynamics is stopped and the resulting b mattis magnetizations are printed on a file .",
    "+ relaxation at non - zero noise is checked through the linked list ( see next step ) : the pointer of each helper that is aligned with its own field is stored , the ones of helpers with no net fields are removed from the linked list , while all the other helpers mismatched to their own fields , are added into the linked list .",
    "increase of @xmath7 pattern dilution .",

    "the former is a bernoullian approach and essentially if one starts from a dilution @xmath366 toward a dilution @xmath205 essentially may forget the starting information and generate a random pattern with on average one half of zero entries ; the latter is a markovian dilution by which one needs to start from the previous coupling matrix ( and patterns ) diluted at @xmath367 and increases dilution on that structure .",
    "dilution is tuned at steps of @xmath368 , ranging from @xmath204 to @xmath369 .",

    "@xmath6 and are in general in perfect agreement with theory .",
    "in this paper we continued our modeling of immune networks through statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular , we recently proposed a model for the adaptive immune response by which helpers and b - cells interact via cytokines and are described as a fully - connected bipartite spin glass .",
    "we also showed that the model is equivalent to an attractor associative network where helpers are able to arrange b - cells and orchestrate responses ; we underline that this first network was able to elaborate only one strategy at a time , namely , helpers managed only one clonal lineage of b - cells before turning to another one .    here",
    "we introduce dilution in the bipartite spin - glass such that only a fraction of the whole b - repertoire interacts with a given helper lineage , which is a much more biological description and we obtain remarkable emergent behavior . at first",
    ", we have shown that diluting the bipartite b - h spin - glass is very different from diluting directly the resulting h - h associative network .",
    "in particular , while in the latter the peak of the distribution of the fields insisting on the dynamical variables is a monotone decreasing function as dilution is increased , the former -our dilution- shows a minimum ( as a function of noise level ) and a high non trivial behavior .",
    "this hides in fact a new important property of these networks : they develop , as an emerging feature , the ability of retrieval of multiple strategies together ; namely helpers are able to orchestrate and coordinate the responses of several b - clones at the same time .",
    "remarkably , each time the network of helpers retrieves patterns / strategies for ( the correct ) b - cell expansions , the corresponding mattis magnetization is maximized ( e.g. each helper belonging to the retrieval has the same sign of the cytochine linking it to the b - clone ) .",
    "this means that the field that insists on the b - clone , which on average ( when no retrieval exists ) is zero , becomes @xmath370 such that each retrieval in the helper network generates a `` magnetic field '' on the b - clone ( in the b - h network ) and consequenly the latter is forced to expand .",
    "another interesting remark is that the strength of the field increases as dilution is decreased : this could gives hint about the microscopic interpretation of the dilution in terms of reaction - diffusion kinetics of lymphocytes and their signalling ( on which we plan to report soon ) , as , for instance , increasing the mean square velocity of these elements ( e.g. via fever and increased heartbeats ) , decreases network dilution and , consequently , increased the quality and the strength of the signal on the b - cells .",
    "in particular we studied in detail the case where helpers manage an amount of b - clones proportional to the logarithm of the h repertoire , so to say , if the repertoire of helpers is made of by e.g. @xmath371 different clones ( like in humane immune systems ) , the network is able to manage at the same time @xmath372 different clonal lineage of b - cells .",
    "this is an important step forward a rationale understanding of these lymphocyte networks because the immune system is always supposed to fight several pathogens at each time .    turning to technicalities , we studied the model via statistical mechanics solving for the free - energy and obtaining through the extremization of the latter , the order parameter self - consistencies , which have been explicitly written for the simplest case of two and three parallel retrieved patterns .",
    "these equations have been hierarchically solved and tested against the results coming from signal - to - noise analysis and monte carlo simulations : once showed that the `` pure state ansatz '' of neural networks in this context can no longer minimize the free energy , we introduced a `` parallel ansatz '' and performed the signal - to - noise analysis to confirm its validity by studying the stability of the basin of attraction of the minima it generated .",
    "further , we performed monte carlo simulations to confirm numerically the whole scenario .",
    "overall we found perfect agreement among all the results stemmed from these different techniques .",
    "future works , beyond the microscopical interpretation of the tunable parameters , would investigate the saturated case , which is still mathematically challenging ; then the system in presence of antigens ( fields ) and a detailed refinement discriminating between b - clones ( which here are all supposed to share the same structural characteristics ) with low / high avidity against own tissues with the aim of showing further emerging properties as the clonal anergy for high avidity b - clonal lineages resulting in self / non - self discrimination problems .",
