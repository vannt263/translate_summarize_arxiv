    "the state of cold dense matter in the vicinity of phase transition from baryonic matter to quark matter presumed to be present in the interior of compact stars is not understood at all .",
    "this is because there is no realistic model - independent tool to probe that regime . in this paper , inspired by weinberg s notion of ",
    "mended symmetry \"  @xcite , we would like to explore the possibility that in baryonic matter at some high density , there emerge in the chiral limit a multiplet of massless particles consisting of goldstone bosons as well as other massless particles to fill out a full representation of the chiral symmetry group of qcd .",
    "this issue is relevant not only for the phase structure of dense baryonic matter but also for understanding certain astrophysical properties of compact stars that are being observed .",
    "this has a potentially intriguing implication on the recently observed @xmath0 neutron star  @xcite as will be explained in the concluding section .    before entering into the details of our reasoning",
    ", we should underline our basic assumption .",
    "we will assume that as one approaches the chiral restoration point in density , local fields continue to be relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "there are at present neither strong theoretical arguments nor experimental indications for the validity of such an assumption .",
    "should it turn out that the notion of local fields makes no sense at high density in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition , then what we present in what follows would have no value .",
    "if however the notion made sense , then the proposed scenario would have an important implication on what happens to the repulsive core , a long - standing mystery in nuclear physics and a crucial ingredient for the physics of compact stars .",
    "we will find that as one approaches the critical density , the repulsion should be strongly suppressed , a result which has not been previously uncovered .    in the broken symmetry sector ,",
    "the symmetry of such multplets is not  visible . \"",
    "involving massless vector fields , what is at issue would then be ( hidden ) gauge symmetry manifesting explicitly at a possibly second order phase transition .",
    "in fact the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) theory of harada and yamawaki  @xcite with the vector manifestation ( vm ) fixed point with the vector mesons joining the pions in the same multiplet is precisely of this class .",
    "one should note that the symmetry involved here is a flavor symmetry , which is of course not a fundamental symmetry contained in qcd .",
    "it should more appropriately be viewed as an  emergent symmetry \"  analogously to the cp@xmath1 model  , and as such can be extended , starting from 4d low - energy theorems , to an infinite tower of gauge fields leading to a deconstruction of the fifth dimension in 5d yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "whether or not and how the massless multplets can manifest themselves at a phase transition such as chiral restoration are totally unknown and constitute the main line of research in nuclear / hadron as well as astro - hadron physics .    the question we would like to raise here is : how to exploit the properties of hidden local symmetry in unraveling dense baryonic matter ?",
    "for this purpose , we first note that there are two indispensable degrees of freedom that are missing in hls lagrangian , i.e. , baryons and scalars .",
    "the hls lagrangian contains , apart from the pions , vector mesons but no scalars . in nuclear physics , as we know from walecka model  @xcite that works fairly well for phenomena near nuclear matter density , together with the vector mesons @xmath2 , a scalar meson is indispensable , e.g. , for binding .",
    "now the scalar that figures in walecka model can not be the scalar of the linear sigma model , for if it were that scalar , nuclear matter would be unstable .",
    "in fact it has to be a chiral scalar . on the other hand , at high density , the relevant lagrangian that has correct symmetry is the linear sigma model , and the scalar that is needed there is the fourth component of the chiral four - vector @xmath3 .",
    "thus in order to probe highly dense matter , we have to figure out how the chiral scalar at low density transmutes to the fourth component of the four - vector .",
    "we should stress that this is a part of the long - standing scalar puzzle in low - energy hadron physics , which remains still highly controversial .    in this work , in the same spirit as what entered in the formulation of br scaling  @xcite",
    ", a chiral scalar will be introduced as a dilaton associated with broken conformal symmetry and responsible for the trace anomaly of qcd .",
    "following @xcite , we write the trace anomaly  which is proportional ( in the chiral limit ) to the gluon condensate @xmath4  in terms of  soft \" dilaton @xmath5 and  hard \" dilaton @xmath6 . as suggested in @xcite , we will associate the soft dilaton with that component locked to the quark condensate @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that this is the component which  melts \" across the chiral phase transition , with the hard component remaining non - vanishing  .    as for baryons",
    ", the best way would be that they are generated as solitons in hls theory . as stressed since a long time  @xcite",
    ", baryons generated as skyrmions in the presence of vector mesons could most efficiently capture the strong - coupling physics needed for nuclear interactions both at nuclear matter density and at higher densities .",
    "indeed this point is given a support by a recent calculation of finite nuclei in terms of bps skyrmions obtained from an infinite - tower hls lagrangian where the higher tower is integrated out  @xcite .",
    "it works much better than the standard skyrmion model without vector mesons in capturing the dynamics of few - body nuclear systems .",
    "it may be viewed as an additional support for the power of the hls strategy advocated in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately a controlled systematic treatment of many - nucleon systems is mathematically involved and has not been worked out except for certain topologically robust properties  @xcite that will be mentioned below .",
    "we will therefore put nucleon fields by hand by coupling them in hidden gauge invariant way to the mesons @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and to the scalar dilaton .    in introducing baryonic degrees of freedom ,",
    "there are two alternative ways of assigning chirality to the nucleons .",
    "one is the  naive \" assignment   and the other the mirror assignment .",
    "the  naive \" assignment is anchored on the standard chiral symmetry structure where the entire constituent quark or nucleon mass ( in the chiral limit ) is generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking . the nonlinear sigma model ( and its gauge - equivalent hls model )",
    "is the typical example of this type .",
    "the merit of this model is that it is consistent with the constituent quark model which enjoys the successful mass relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the average of the nucleon and @xmath13 masses .",
    "the constituent quark model is supported by large @xmath14 considerations not only at low - energy scale but also at intermediate - energy scale  @xcite .",
    "whether it is a viable model at shorter - scale as in high density is of course not known .",
    "the alternative , mirror assignment  @xcite , allows a chiral invariant mass term common to the parity - doublets that can remain non - zero at chiral restoration , which means that a part of the nucleon mass , say , @xmath15 , must arise from a mechanism that is not associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the origin of such a mass @xmath15 is not known , but  priori , there is no reason why it can not be present . at present , analysis of various observables both in the vacuum such as pion - nucleon scattering etc . and in medium such as nuclear matter properties etc .",
    "based on linear and nonlinear sigma models with mirror symmetry  @xcite can not rule out an @xmath15 of a few hundred mev .",
    "if @xmath15 is non - negligible , then the direct relation of masses between baryons and mesons enjoyed by the constituent quark model will no longer be obvious even if it still holds .",
    "nonetheless there is a motivation for considering this scenario .",
    "there is an unexpected indication from simulations of skyrmion matter on crystal lattice to introduce density that the meson and baryon masses behave differently in increasing density : the baryon mass appears to drop at a slower rate than the meson mass as density is increased and may not vanish at the chiral restoration point .",
    "this is an outcome of the model albeit at large @xmath14 , not put in _ ab initio_. such a different in - medium behavior between mesons and baryons is found to have an important consequence on the nuclear tensor forces and hence on the eos of baryonic matter at densities exceeding the nuclear matter density  @xcite .",
    "given that the eos involves shorter - length scale than that probed by vacuum and nuclear phenomenology , the mirror scenario combined with hls may prove to be relevant for eos at high density .",
    "the objective of this paper is to explore the consequences of a dilaton - implemented hls ( dhls for short ) lagrangian containing baryons both in the  naive \" and the mirror assignments at normal as well as high densities .",
    "the strategy we will use to drive the system from nuclear matter density to near chiral restoration density is the  dilaton limit \" proposed by beane and van kolck  @xcite .",
    "phenomenology of vacuum processes with this lagrangian will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    as a brief summary of the results , we note that the dhls model at nuclear matter density in mean field in the  naive \" assignment scheme is equivalent to walecka s mean - field model , with the scalar figuring as a chiral scalar .",
    "we expect that the same should hold in the mirror assignment if the model applied at normal nuclear matter density . as the dilaton limit",
    "is taken , a linear sigma model in both assignments emerges from the highly nonlinear dhls structure with the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons decoupling from the nucleons .",
    "this transmutation is highly nonlinear involving singularities .",
    "a striking prediction of this procedure is that the vector - meson  nucleon vector coupling goes to zero at the dilaton limit .",
    "this simply means that as the dilaton limit is approached as density increases , two hitherto unexpected phenomena could occur .",
    "firstly the well - known @xmath10-nucleon interaction known to be repulsive at low density should get strongly suppressed at high density .",
    "secondly the nuclear symmetry energy denoted in the literature as @xmath16 that encodes the energy cost in the excess of neutrons in compact - star systems should also get weaker .",
    "an immediate consequence would be that the eos of dense matter , particularly of compact - star matter , will be softened at higher density .",
    "this result is a distinctive feature of the hls structure of the model that is not present in the absence of hls vector mesons .",
    "an intriguing question is what effect this  quenching \" of the repulsive core will have on the recently observed 1.97 @xmath17 neutron star .",
    "this question is highly pertinent to the recent description of the 1.97 @xmath17 neutron star in terms of a three - layered structure of the compact star consisting of nuclear matter , kaon condensed nuclear matter and strange - quark matter  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of repulsion or effectively an attraction at high density will clearly have an important impact on stabilizing 2-solar - mass stars .",
    "this issue will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "following the two - component concept for dilatons proposed in  @xcite , the dilaton potential written in terms of soft @xmath5 and hard @xmath6 components @xmath18 will be assumed to have a negligible mixing between soft and hard sectors in order to avoid an undesirably strong coupling of the glueball to pions .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath5 is assumed to vanish when chiral symmetry is restored  @xcite , whereas the one of @xmath6 remains finite , representing the  explicit breaking \" of conformal invariance , i.e. , the scale anomaly in qcd .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite with an hls lagrangian that the soft dilaton plays an important role in the emergence of a half - skyrmion phase at high density where a skyrmion turns into two half skyrmions  @xcite . in the subsequent sections we construct an effective theory for the soft dilaton while the hard component which plays no role in taking the dilaton limit but figures as the source for @xmath15 in the mirror assignment will be kept as @xmath6 . ] , pions and vector mesons to go from non - linear basis ( hls ) to a linear basis , which enables us to deal readily with the scalar degree of freedom near the chiral symmetry restoration .",

    "a noteworthy feature of the dilaton - limit lagrangian ( [ naivelag ] ) is that the vector mesons decouple from the nucleons while their coupling to the goldstone bosons remains . as announced in introduction , this has two striking new predictions .",
    "taking the dilaton limit drives the yukawa interaction to vanish as @xmath69 for @xmath70 for any finite value of @xmath44 . in hls for the meson sector , the model has the vector manifestation ( vm ) fixed point as one approaches chiral restoration , so the hls coupling @xmath44 also tends to zero proportional to the quark condensate .",
    "it thus follows that combined with the vm , the coupling @xmath71 will tend to vanish rapidly near the phase transition point . in nuclear forces , what is effective is the ratio @xmath72 which goes as @xmath73 .",
    "this means that ( 1 ) the two - body repulsion which holds two nucleons apart at short distance will be suppressed in dense medium and ( 2 ) the symmetry energy going as @xmath74 will also get suppressed . as a principal consequence , the eos at some high density approaching the dilaton limit will become softer _ even without such exotic happenings as kaon condensation or strange quark matter_.    it has been argued that the short - range point - like three - neutron force essentially constrains the maximum mass of the neutron star  @xcite . in the  naive \" assignment , we can have such a three - body force from the @xmath10-exchange graph given in fig .  [ 3nomega ] .",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite that the same three - body force is predominantly responsible for the suppressed gamow - teller matrix element accounting for the long life - time of @xmath75c .",
    "since the same suppression can be explained very well by brown - rho scaling in the nuclear tensor forces without three - body forces  @xcite , there may be considerable overlap between the various mechanisms evoked for the process .",
    "similar overlap may be at work for the eos of the neutron stars and it may be dangerous to draw conclusions based on one particular model or scheme . in the present scheme with the dilaton encoding the scaling property , both three - body forces and scaling properties can be  and should be  consistently taken into account .    in the present scheme ,",
    "the shortest - range component of the three - body forces is given by the graph of fig .",
    "[ 3nomega ] .",
    "the intermediate states entering in the middle nucleon line should be higher - lying than nucleon and hence could be integrated out .",
    "the resulting effective @xmath76 vertex is expected to be smooth - varying in density , remaining finite in the dilaton limit .",
    "therefore the three - body potential of fig .",
    "[ 3nomega ] will carry the factor @xmath77 that vanishes in the dilaton limit .",
    "the one - pion exchange three - body force involving a contact two - body force will also get suppressed as @xmath78 .",
    "thus only the longest - range two - pion exchange three - body forces will remain operative at large density in compact stars .",
    "how this intricate mechanism affects the eos at high density is a challenge issue to resolve .",
    "the lagrangian of mirror nucleons in the non - linear realization without vector mesons was considered in  @xcite .",
    "its hls - extended form is found to be @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the nucleon doublet in the chiral eigenstate , the @xmath81 are the pauli matrices in the parity pair space , and the mass parameters @xmath82 and @xmath15 . implementing the dilaton field ,",
    "one obtains @xmath83 where we require that the ( broken ) scale symmetry is possessed by the hard dilaton in the last term since the nucleon mass becomes @xmath15 at chiral symmetry restoration and can be traced back to the non - vanishing gluon condensate in symmetric phase . in this way we are attributing the origin of @xmath15 to the hard component of the gluon condensate , which is chiral invariant",
    "of course the origin of @xmath15 could be something else but at this moment , we have no idea as to what that could be .",

    "the softening of eos at large density in the mirror model is quite similar to the case of the  naive \" model .",
    "the suppression of the vector coupling is of the same form : @xmath103 that the quenching of the short - range repulsion is independent of the chirality assignment of the nucleon is indicative of a universality of the short - distance interaction .",

    "the chiral symmetry is restored as the vm characterized by the fixed point of renormalization group equations , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which leads to the massless vector meson as the chiral partner of the pion  @xcite , and remains so in the presence of constituent quarks ( or fermions in the  naive \" assignment ) .",

    "in fact , @xmath148 is non - monotonic and becomes unphysical below @xmath149 mev within the above setup .",
    "what we must have is a second - order with scalars at finite @xmath150 and/or @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , the current dilaton potential needs to be modified in the presence of matter where a temperature and a chemical potential are additional scales responsible for the trace anomaly , other than @xmath152 .    the mixing strength @xmath135 may be determined in matter - free space with the known spectroscopy for the scalars .",
    "this requires us to extend the model to three flavors , which is beyond the scope of the paper and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "up to this point we have ignored the axial - vector mesons that figure in the mended symmetry . as long as their masses are greater than the masses of other mesons ,",
    "the axial - vector mesons can be integrated out .",
    "however the mended symmetry of weinberg implies that all mesons within the given multiplet become degenerate , and massless when the chiral symmetry is restored . at that point one",
    "must deal with the axial - vector mesons on the same footing with the others . in this section ,",
    "we give a brief discussion of how the axial vector mesons can be incorporated into the hls framework . incorporating baryons ,",
    "both in the  naive \" assignment and in the mirror assignment , is straightforward and hence will not be explicited .",

    "the basic premise in our line of thinking was that local field degrees of freedom make sense  and hence the notion of mended symmetry is applicable  up to the point where the density - driven chiral phase transition takes place .",
    "this would preclude strongly first - order transitions or the total breakdown of description in terms of quasiparticles  such as  hadron melting \"  in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "if it were so , our discussion would be of no meaning . at present , there are no indications that enable us to make a firm statement on that . taking the dilaton limit  la beane and van kolck on a dilaton - implemented hidden local symmetry lagrangian that we identify with going to near chiral restoration density , we uncover a number of surprising results in both  naive \" and mirror models due to that vector mesons decouple from baryons .",
    "one important prediction is that the repulsion at short distance in nuclear interactions should get suppressed at a density in the vicinity of the dilaton limit .",
    "another hitherto unsuspected result is that the symmetry energy which plays a crucial role in the structure of compact stars also should get suppressed .",
    "put together , they will soften the eos of compact - star matter at some high density .",
    "an interesting possibility is that our mechanism could accommodate an exotica - free nucleon - only eos ( such as ap4 in fig . 3 of @xcite ) with a requisite softening at higher density that could be compatible with the @xmath0 neutron star data  @xcite .",
    "it is well - established in matter - free space that there is a strong repulsion between two nucleons .",
    "in fact , it is confirmed in lattice gauge calculations  @xcite .",
    "and there are evidences from nn scattering .",
    "however the mechanism of the two - body repulsion is mysterious and remains unexplained .",
    "it could be a pauli - exclusion principle effect at the quark level or topological effect in terms of the baryon - number-2 soliton etc .",
    "in effective field theory , it can be explained in terms of an @xmath10 exchange .",
    "in fact a similar structure is seen in holographic qcd models where an infinite tower of vector mesons figure  @xcite .",
    "there is no lattice information for three - body forces but model considerations predict similar repulsion for them as well .",
    "when it comes to nuclear matter and denser matter , the situation is totally unclear .",
    "what one has learned from nuclear structure studies is that the  hard core \" is not a physical observable in medium , that is , it is not visible .",
    "it is shoved under what is known as  short - range correlation . \" in fact , nuclear structure approaches anchored on effective field theory and renormalization group show that the  hard - core \" repulsion present in two - nucleon potentials plays no role in low - energy physical observables  @xcite .",
    "what we find in our model is a surprisingly simple mechanism for taming the hard core in many - body systems . within the field theory framework we are working with ,",
    "the short - distance repulsion is suppressed in the background or  vacuum \" defined by density .",
    "we can not say whether and how this mechanism can be related to the  short - range correlation \" of nuclear physics , but it offers a possible way to understand it from the mended symmetry point of view .    our main observation on the suppressed repulsive interaction is a common feature in the two different assignments ,  naive \" and mirror , of chirality .",
    "the nucleon mass near chiral symmetry restoration exhibits a striking difference in the two scenarios , and the eos in the mirror model is supposed to be stiffer than that in the  naive \" model .",
    "how the dilaton - limit suppression of the repulsion  which seems to be universal independent of the assignments but may manifest itself differently in the two cases  will affect the eos for compact stars is an interesting question to investigate .",
    "finally some comments on the nature of the dialton at low and high densities .",
    "we have assumed that taking the dilaton limit effectuates a level crossing between two ( or three ) levels in such a way that at low density the relevant scalar degree of freedom is a low - mass ( @xmath181 mev ) chiral singlet effective for binding in nuclei and at high density it is the @xmath35 , the 4-th component of the chiral four vector for @xmath182 , effective in  mending \" the relevant symmetry .",
    "how this can happen has been studied in certain simple models  @xcite but it is highly likely that the physics involved in such change - over is a lot more intricate .",
    "this is evidenced by the indication that a level crossing of a similar nature occurs in scalar channel if one varies the number of colors ( @xmath14 )  @xcite .",
    "a proper understanding will require correlating these and possibly other mechanisms involved in the change - over .",
