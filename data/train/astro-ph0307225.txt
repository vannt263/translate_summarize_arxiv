    "the exotic class of pulsars collectively known as `` anomalous x - ray pulsars '' ( axps * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has recently been shown @xcite to exhibit short , hard - spectrum x - ray bursts that are very similar to those long seen in another equally exotic class of objects , the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "the properties of the latter class have been well described by the magnetar model , in which the objects are isolated , young neutron stars that are powered by the decay of an enormous stellar magnetic field @xcite . in exhibiting bursts , axps have unified the two classes of object , and provided strong support that the magnetar model applies to both . however , what , if anything , physically distinguishes the two classes is still unknown .",
    "observationally , axps appear to be the less active of the two source classes , with only one major bursting episode ever detected ( and that , fortutously ) , compared with many seen from sgrs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "1rxs j170849.0@xmath04000910 ( which , for brevity , we henceforth refer to as 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 ) is an 11-s x - ray pulsar discovered by @xcite in _ asca _ data , and shown to be spinning down like other axps by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the pulsar is capable of very stable rotation on the basis of @xmath11.4  yr of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) data that permitted phase - coherent timing using a simple spin - down model with only two free parameters .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of the first rotation glitch seen in an axp in data from 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 , and showed that the glitch had properties ( e.g. fractional frequency change @xmath2 ) similar to those seen in the vela radio pulsar and other radio pulsars like it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the rotational stability away from the glitch and the similarity of the glitch properties with those seen in radio pulsars lent supporting evidence for the magnetar model",
    "however , no activity beyond that single glitch has been reported for the pulsar .",
    "interestingly , the major bursting episode observed with _ rxte _  from a different axp ,",
    "1e  2259 + 586 , was accompanied by a significant rotational glitch , having @xmath3 , of which a fraction @xmath10.25 recovered on a time scale of @xmath150  day @xcite .",
    "also observed were short - lived pulse profile variations and an x - ray flux enhancement .",
    "this event occurred in spite of the pulsar having shown stable rotational behavior in over 5  yr of previous _ rxte _",
    "monitoring @xcite , although the long - term past record hinted at episodes of activity @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests that glitching may be a typical characteristic of axps during outbursts , and/or vice versa .",
    "however , with only one such event seen , such conclusions are tentative at best .    here",
    "we report on continued _ rxte _  monitoring of 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 .",
    "our data set now extends over 5.4  yr . in this interval , in addition to the glitch reported by @xcite , we have detected a second glitch @xmath11.5  yr later .",
    "accounting for both glitches in a phase - coherent timing solution that extends over the full data set , we find phase residuals of @xmath42% of the pulse period .",
    "we compare the properties of the two glitches seen in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 , and show that their recoveries are quite different , with the second more closely resembling that seen in 1e  2259 + 586  in outburst .",
    "this suggests that 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  may undergo similar bursting activity which has gone unseen by our sparse sampling .",
    "note that a subset of the data reported here has recently been analyzed as well by @xcite , who reach similar though slightly different conclusions .",
    "we briefly discuss the differences between their results and ours .",
    "the _ rxte _ observations described here are a continuation of those reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to those papers for details of the analysis procedure .",
    "briefly , all observations were obtained with the proportional counter array ( pca * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with events selected in the energy range 2.55.4  kev to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the data we report on were obtained roughly monthly from 1998 january through 2003 may and were analyzed using software designed to handle raw spacecraft telemetry packet data .",
    "data were binned at 31.25-ms time resolution and reduced to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de200 ephemeris .",
    "time series were folded at the nominal pulse period using 64 phase bins .",
    "folded profiles were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise - ratio average profile in order to determine an average pulse arrival time .",
    "resulting arrival times were analyzed using the tempo pulsar timing software package in order to derive a fully phase - coherent timing ephemeris over the entire data set .",
    "phase coherence over the glitches is accomplished under the assumption of zero phase jump at the time of the glitch  any non - zero phase jump would suggest an unphysically large torque on the star .",
    "we assume a glitch model of the form observed for radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pre - glitch spin ephemeris , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the permanent changes in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the change in @xmath9 that recovers exponentially on a time scale @xmath12 .",
    "best - fit model parameters are given in table  [ ta : parms ] .",
    "figure  1 ( top panel ) shows the model long - term frequency history of the pulsar .",
    "the spin - ups , though small compared to the overall spin - down behavior , are just visible to the eye .",
    "figure  1 ( bottom panel ) shows the same model with the linear trend removed , and the observed frequencies superimposed .",
    "these frequencies were determined using the same arrival time data , but by doing local fits for frequency using 34 arrival times per plotted point .    the first glitch ( glitch 1 )",
    "is modelled as a simple step in @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , i.e. has @xmath13 in equation  [ eq : glitch ] .",
    "the second glitch ( glitch 2 ) , however , as can be seen from table  [ ta : parms ] , has @xmath14 .",
    "a fraction @xmath15 of the total frequency jump recovered following the glitch .",
    "this is consistent with a full recovery , and contrasts with glitch 1 , for which @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , no significant change in @xmath10 occured at glitch 2 , unlike at glitch 1 .",
    "we set a 3@xmath17 upper limit on a change in @xmath10 relative to the long - term average of @xmath18  hz  s@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite report a significant change in @xmath10 at glitch 2 , at first glance at odds with what we find .",
    "this is not because of their smaller data set post - glitch 2 .",
    "we can reproduce their result when we fit for @xmath20 in the inter - glitch interval .",
    "@xcite are reporting an _ instantaneous _ change in @xmath10 at the glitch epoch , while we report the change of the long - term averages .",
    "we believe the latter is more physically relevant , since the former can be contaminated ( as is the case here ) by noise . indeed , that we find no change in @xmath10 post - glitch 2 would have to be a coincidence otherwise .",
    "reporting the instantaneous change in @xmath9 is appropriate however , because the evolution of @xmath9 is dominated by the deterministic spin - down .",
    "phase residuals following removal of the model given in the table are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the rms residual is 0.019@xmath21 , comparable to that seen for young radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are clearly unmodelled features in the residuals .",
    "the data pre - glitch 1 are well described by a simple model including only @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "there is marginal evidence for @xmath20 , but as discussed by @xcite , its statistical significance is only @xmath22 , with removal of the very first data point giving @xmath23 .",
    "if real , this term could be due to timing noise or to recovery from a glitch that occurred prior to the commencement of the observations .",
    "the residuals between glitches , however , definitely show a significant @xmath20 as reported by @xcite . in that analysis",
    ", it was suggested that this could be recovery from a glitch .",
    "however , it could also be a manifestation of timing noise since the magnitude of the observed @xmath20 is comparable to that detected pre - glitch 1 .",
    "the occurrence of glitch 2 precludes answering the question of the origin of the inter - glitch @xmath20 .",
    "the residuals post - glitch 2 , though overall described well by equation  [ eq : glitch ] , show small but significant deviations from that model .",
    "initially , the recovery appears to be slightly slower than the exponential model , resulting in the relatively large residual just post - glitch .",
    "the longer - term post - glitch-2 residuals can not be modelled well by any polynomial with fewer than 8 parameters .",
    "we can , however , model them reasonably well with only 4 parameters , if we ignore the glitch and consider only post - glitch data .",
    "that ephemeris is provided in table  [ ta : altparms ] , although we believe it is unlikely to have precise long - term predictive power .",
    "we note that some young radio pulsars do not show simple exponential recoveries , but rather multiple recovery time scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because of the bursting behavior seen in two other axps , we searched all pca data obtained for 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  for bursts .",
    "this was done by creating binned time series for each pca proportional counter unit separately , using time resolution 31.25  ms .",
    "we used events in the energy range 220  kev .",
    "we used this wider energy range for the burst search compared to that used in the timing because of the observed relatively hard axp burst spectra compared to the pulsed emission spectrum @xcite .",
    "a total of 310.5  ks of pca exposure was searched , for the same time span as for the timing analysis . the burst search procedure used",
    "is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "briefly , large excursions from a local mean count rate existing in all pcus were flagged using a poissonian probability discriminator .",
    "no statistically significant bursts were found in any data for 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 .",
    "the upper limits on burst fluxes and fluences depend strongly on the ( varying ) local background rate , the burst morphology and the burst spectrum .",
    "our sensitivity to bursts for 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  is a factor of @xmath13 below that for 1e  2259 + 586  ( as estimated from the average total pca count rates from both sources in the 220  kev band ) , and the faintest bursts detected for 1e  2259 + 586  have fluence @xmath24  erg  @xmath25 in the 210  kev band @xcite .",
    "we also searched for pulsed flux and pulse morphology changes over the 5.4-yr time span , and especially just after the glitch epochs .",
    "both were done with data in the 210  kev band and using the methods detailed by @xcite .",
    "the pulsed flux time series over the 5.4-yr span is similar in nature to that shown by @xcite , i.e. stable at the 2030% level .",
    "specifically , there is no evidence for enhanced pulsed flux post - glitch 2 .",
    "similarly , we find no evidence for large pulse profile changes at any epoch in our data set , including immediately post - glitch .",
    "however , our standard analysis procedure is not optimized for detection of low - level changes .",
    "we will present a more detailed pulse profile analysis elsewhere .",
    "we note that @xcite claim evidence for low - level pulse profile variations by comparing average profiles of data pre - glitch 1 , between glitches , and post - glitch 2 .",
    "however , those authors did not consider whether such low - level changes , occur in intervals that are not separated by glitches .",
    "hence if real , the changes they found may be unrelated to the spin - up events .",
    "the two glitches observed in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  exhibit very different recoveries , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] above .",
    "specifically , glitch 2 was dominated by a frequency jump that recovered exponentially on a @xmath150  day time scale , while glitch 1 showed no such decay .",
    "interestingly , the recovery seen in glitch 2 is very similar to that observed in 1e  2259 + 586  during its 2002 june outburst @xcite . for 1e  2259 + 586 ,",
    "however , @xmath26 @xcite , different from the @xmath27 seen for 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 .",
    "we note that although the first glitch was much smaller than the second , its long - term effect on the rotation of the pulsar is probably much greater , mainly because of its apparently permanent change in @xmath10 .",
    "the similarity of glitch 2 for 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  with that of 1e  2259 + 586  during outburst suggests that the former may have been accompanied by bursting behavior as well .",
    "such bursts would have gone undetected because of the absence of any pca observations near the glitch epoch .",
    "indeed , the detection of the bursting from 1e  2259 + 586  was fortuitous , having lasted only a few hours . however , in the latter , the pulsed flux increased by over an order of magnitude at the time of the outburst and decayed on a time scale of weeks , remaining over a factor of two brighter for @xmath13  weeks , but not returning back to its pre - burst value even after a year @xcite .",
    "the time between our best estimate of the glitch  2 epoch ( table  [ ta : parms ] ) and the next observation of 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  was 3  weeks , possibly long enough for a pulsed flux enhancement or major pulse profile change to have decayed beyond detectability .",
    "hence the observations can not rule out an unseen outburst at the time of the 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  glitches .",
    "it is interesting to compare the glitching properties of 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  with those of the better studied radio pulsars .",
    "glitches occur predominantly in radio pulsars having characteristic ages",
    "@xmath28  yr . hence the glitches of 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  support its youth , independent of its characteristic age .",
    "@xcite introduced a glitch `` activity parameter '' for radio pulsars , defined as the sum of all frequency increments in a data span , divided by that data span duration .",
    "this quantity , admittedly on the basis of only two glitches in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 , @xmath29  s@xmath30 , is in the approximate middle of the distribution of glitch activities for radio pulsars @xcite , and two orders of magnitude smaller than that for observed for the vela pulsar .",
    "the frequency of glitches in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009 , again , tentatively estimated from only two glitches , is @xmath10.4  yr@xmath19 , again in the approximate middle of the distribution for young radio pulsars , and substantially below the record holder , psr  j1341@xmath06220 @xcite .",
    "the difference in recovery behavior between the two glitches seen in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  is not without precedent in radio pulsars ; for example , both psrs j1731@xmath04744 and j1803@xmath02137 have shown order of magnitude differences in @xmath31-values for different glitches @xcite . however , two 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  glitch properties are unusual among radio pulsar glitches .",
    "the 50-day recovery time scale of glitch 2 is relatively short , although shorter recoveries have been seen for the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "in addition , the large @xmath31 of glitch  2 is unprecedented in radio pulsar glitches , the bulk of which are in the range 00.5 .    in the context of vortex unpinning models @xcite , glitches arise when vortex lines in the neutron - star crustal superfluid unpin from crustal lattice nuclei , then repin and transfer angular momentum from the faster rotating superfluid to the crust and coupled stellar core . @xcite identified two regimes of glitch recovery : a linear regime in which a small superfluid - crust angular velocity lag suffices to unpin vortices because of weak pinning and for which the glitch decays exponentially , and a non - linear regime in which large lags are necessary and the glitch decays slowly or not at all .",
    "@xcite suggested that hotter , hence younger neutron stars would exhibit predominantly linear - regime glitches , while colder , hence older neutron stars non - linear glitches .",
    "there is some evidence for this from studies of radio pulsar glitches @xcite .",
    "the detection of both types in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  indicates , in the context of this model , that both strong and weak vortex line pinnings are present in the crust .",
    "this is true of many radio pulsars . for a lengthier discussion of glitch models ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if glitch 2 in 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  was accompanied by unobserved bursts and persistent emission changes as observed for 1e  2259 + 586 , the event could have resulted from a sudden event in the stellar crust , such as a crustal fracture , which simultaneously affected both the superfluid interior and the magnetosphere .",
    "such a crustal fracture is an expected result of stresses due to the decay of the large stellar magnetic field . in this scenario ,",
    "the fracture both triggered the vortex - line unpinning , and simultaneously shifted magnetic footpoints , resulting in a magnetospheric reconfiguration .",
    "searches in future data from 1rxs  1708@xmath04009  for behaviors like those seen for 1e  2259 + 586  during its 2002 june outburst are clearly warranted .",
