    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) produces temperature and linear polarization radio maps at five frequencies with @xmath1 or better resolution and tightly constrained systematic errors .",
    "the frequency bands are centered on 22 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz ; denoted k , ka , q , v , and w , respectively ( see @xcite for details ) . while designed to measure the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation it also observes the large - scale structure of our galaxy at angular scales and frequencies that are relatively unexplored .",
    "study of our own galaxy has had a significant effect on our understanding of galaxies in general .",
    "radio emission from galaxies is generally understood as arising from three effects : `` non - thermal '' synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons spiraling in large - scale magnetic fields , `` thermal '' free - free emission from non - relativistic electron - ion interactions , and emission from vibrational modes of thermal dust grains . at lower radio frequencies the synchrotron emission is usually dominant , with flux decreasing at higher frequencies approximately according to a power law and antenna temperature",
    "is @xmath2 , with the spectral indices related by @xmath3 . unless otherwise noted ,",
    "results will be expressed in antenna temperature .",
    "for the pixel size most commonly used in this work ( @xmath4 ) , the conversion from antenna temperature to flux is approximately @xmath5 @xcite . ] ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "free - free emission has a flux that is nearly constant with frequency ( @xmath7 ) , so free - free emission becomes relatively more important than synchrotron at higher frequencies .",
    "typically the crossover frequency is near 60 ghz at higher latitudes , but can be 20 ghz or lower in specific regions in the galactic plane .",
    "frequencies above @xmath860 ghz begin to probe the tail ( @xmath9 of vibrational dust emission , which is dominant around 90 ghz .",
    "in addition to these three foregrounds , much recent work has focused on the possibility of significant emission from rapidly rotating dust grains ; this emission is thought to peak somewhere in the 1030 ghz range and fall off roughly exponentially at higher frequencies .",
    "the spectral behavior for diffuse foregrounds is of great interest .",
    "the spectrum for synchrotron radiation follows the energy distribution for high - energy electrons , which is not a pure power law .",
    "the highest energy electrons lose energy more quickly and thus are reduced in regions where they have not been replenished .",
    "such energy loss shows up as a gradual steepening ( @xmath10 ) in the power law index by about @xmath11 at frequencies above @xmath12@xmath13 mhz .",
    "further , while the overall index as extrapolated from lower frequencies is @xmath14 @xcite , higher frequencies may preferentially sample more energetic electron populations and thus have a flatter index ( @xmath15 ) @xcite",
    ". observations of both discrete sources @xcite and external galaxies @xcite show a wide variety of synchrotron behavior .",
    "free - free emission also does not follow a strict power law , but the physics is well understood and the variation of the power - law index over _ wmap _ s bands is so small that it can be neglected .",
    "finally , the rayleigh - jeans tail for vibrational dust emission ( i.e. below @xmath16100 ghz ) has never before been accurately measured and the relevant material properties of the dust grains themselves are not fully understood .",
    "the main focus in this work is on foreground emission .",
    "section [ sec : fiveyearfits ] describes updates to masks and foreground - fitting procedures used in previous _",
    "analyses @xcite .",
    "a new method to explicitly marginalize over foregrounds for the low multipole analysis is described in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "a new fitting process is described in section [ sec : mcmc ] , which has the following features :    * the fitting is entirely in real - space with no spherical harmonic decomposition for any component . * the spectral indices of the synchrotron and dust emission are not generally assumed to be constant and",
    "are allowed to vary down to the scale of the fit ( approximately one square degree ) . *",
    "the fit includes the cmb and automatically generates the full likelihood ( including covariance ) for all foreground parameters . * the polarization data are included and fit simultaneously with the total intensity data .",
    "this is similar to the technique of @xcite , however we fit the cmb in pixel - space , use less smoothing on the maps , and attempt to obtain more information about individual foregrounds .",
    "the results of the fit are described in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "while the fitting technique used here delivers a cmb map with error - bars , the map itself has not proved to be any better for cosmological analysis and so far has been used only as a check .",
    "implications of the fit are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "_ wmap _ s cosmological results do not depend on the fitting process used here .",
    "the diffuse foreground masks are updated for the five - year data analysis .",
    "the primary reason is to mask out free - free emission in the areas of the gum nebula and @xmath17 oph , while keeping a simple method that applies to the whole sky rather than being _ ad hoc _ for these regions .",
    "the new masks are based on three - year public _",
    "data products , specifically the three - year k and q band - average maps smoothed to one - degree resolution .",
    "these maps are converted to foreground - only maps by subtracting the three - year internal linear combination ( ilc ) map .",
    "a cumulative histogram is made of the pixels in each foreground map , which serves as a lookup table to find a flux level used to define a cut over the desired percentage of the sky .",
    "cuts are made at intervals of @xmath18 in the proportion of sky admitted by the resulting mask .",
    "the k and q band cuts at each percentage level are combined .",
    "resulting masks are inspected and compared with the masks used in the one and three - year _ wmap _  data analyses .",
    "we replace the old kp2 mask with the combined k and q @xmath19 masks .",
    "this is the nominal mask for temperature data analysis and is denoted kq85 .",
    "we replace the old kp0 mask with the combined k and q @xmath20 masks ( kq75 ) .",
    "each of the chosen masks is further processed by omitting any masked `` islands '' containing fewer than 500 pixels at healpix @xcite @xmath21 of 512 .",
    "each mask is then combined with a point source mask , which has been updated from that described in @xcite and @xcite to include 32 newly detected sources from a preliminary version of the _ wmap _  five - year point source catalog .",
    "six sources in the final five - year catalog are not included ; these are relatively weak , with fluxes of 1 jy or lower in all _ wmap _  bands .",
    "the last step combines each mask with the five - year processing cut used to omit the galactic plane from the mapmaking .",
    "a comparison of old and new masks is shown in figure [ fig : maskmap ] .",
    "the three - year polarization mask was based on a cut in k - band polarized intensity combined with a model of the dust component @xcite .",
    "the five - year polarization analysis mask is the same as the three - year version , with the exception that it is combined with the five - year processing cut .",
    "the mcmc fit described below uses a version of the combined k and q @xmath22 mask ( denoted kq95 , and which is similar to the old kp12 mask ) to distinguish `` inside '' from `` outside '' the galactic plane .",
    "the mask was enlarged to account for smoothing , leaving approximately @xmath23 of the sky .",
    "the internal linear combination ( ilc ) method is used to produce a cmb map that is independent of both external data and assumptions about foreground emission . by construction",
    ", it leaves unchanged the component that has the spectrum of the cmb and acts as a foreground fit by filtering out the combined spectral shape that causes the most variance in the data . as a minimum variance method",
    "the ilc is guaranteed to produce a map with good statistical properties , but the level of remaining contamination can be difficult to assess .",

    "as before , the analysis is done on sky maps smoothed to a common resolution of @xmath24 full width at half maximum in all bands . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , we now use maps degraded to healpix @xmath25 pixelization instead of @xmath26 ( the pixel size for the former is @xmath27 ) . in the first year and three - year analyses , the logarithmic term that forces the solution to converge to the priors for low s / n pixels was missing a factor of @xmath28 @xcite ;",

    "the dust and free - free spectrum coefficients are required to follow power - laws , with @xmath39 for dust and @xmath40 for free - free .",
    "hence any `` anomalous '' component , such as electric dipole emission from spinning dust , will be included in the synchrotron component .",
    "the priors used are also unchanged , using the haslam 408 mhz map @xcite for the synchrotron map , extinction - corrected h@xmath41 @xcite for the free - free map , and model 8 of @xcite for the dust map .",

    "the changes are mostly due to differences in the zero levels of the five - year and three - year maps .",
    "the inclusion of the factor of @xmath28 in the mem functional also leads to a small contribution .",
    "the method of setting map zero levels has not changed since the first year analysis .",
    "the internal linear combination cmb map is subtracted from the @xmath24 smoothed map in each frequency band , and the zero level is set such that a fit to the residual map of the form @xmath43 , over the range @xmath44 , yields @xmath45 @xcite .",

    "available foreground templates are expected to trace the distribution of foreground emission more reliably than a @xmath47 model , so template fitting has been done to check the zero levels of the five - year maps . because the mem is itself a template fit , this is essentially equivalent to fitting for the zero levels within the mem procedure .",
    "the five - year ilc map was subtracted from the five - year @xmath24 smoothed maps , and the residual map for each band was fit to a linear combination of synchrotron , free - free , and dust templates plus a constant offset .",
    "uncertainties in the zero levels of the templates were propagated to obtain an uncertainty in the derived offset value . for the synchrotron template ,",

    "while this assumption appears to be safe at high latitudes , it may not be accurate for lines of sight that pass through the galactic plane .",

    "finally , some fits allowed for an additional independent component , either using the exact `` cold neutral medium '' ( cnm ) spectrum for spinning dust @xcite , or using a generalized analytic form @xmath125 the analytic form is a modified blackbody with the amplitude , low - frequency spectral index , and turnover frequency explicitly decoupled from one another . plots of both the exact and `` shifted '' spectra used in the fitting process are shown in figure [ fig : sd ] , as well as a curve showing that the analytic form is indeed a good approximation to the numerically calculated spectrum . in practice the low - frequency spectral index is irrelevant because the desired shape for foreground fitting has @xmath126 well below 22 ghz and is thus dominated by the exponential cutoff .",
    "while this form was motivated as an analytic approximation to spinning dust spectra it could also represent a variety of other physical sources of microwave emission .",
    "this component was assumed to have no significant polarization .",
    "each chain itself is a multi - step process .",
    "the code makes an initial guess for the best - fit parameters and runs for a burn - in period to find the region of parameter space near minimum @xmath31 .",
    "there is then a `` pre - chain '' to find the approximate moments of the likelihood ; these moments are used to optimize the proposal distribution for the final chain .",
    "problems at any stage due to lack of convergence or poorly characterized parameter distributions are flagged and recorded ; only rarely are more than @xmath127 of pixels so affected , and most problems are due to random fluctuations and disappear with longer chains .",
    "the monte carlo process ( with metropolis steps ) has the advantage that it can sample the full parameter space and will converge on the likelihood even if the likelihood is non - gaussian or unknown a priori .",
    "the disadvantage is that degeneracies in parameter space will slow the convergence , and cutting off regions of parameter space to improve convergence can bias the results .",
    "the prime example of this is degeneracy between synchrotron and free - free emission amplitude .",
    "if the synchrotron spectral index is allowed to flatten to the free - free value then the amplitudes of the two components become degenerate parameters , which can distort the fit .",
    "we test this with simulated maps where the input foreground is known . to ensure that the noise properties of the maps are well understood we used extensive simulations .",
    "we combined the high resolution noise information with the low resolution pixel - pixel covariance in order to generate noise realizations that are as realistic as possible , which are then smoothed using the same process used for the real sky maps .",
    "we then produce mock sky maps with cmb realizations synthesized from the _ wmap _ `` best - fit '' @xmath128cdm model , noise realizations from the five year noise covariance matrix , and foregrounds generated from a variety of models .",
    "when degeneracies exist the random fitting process tends to share the amplitude evenly between degenerate parameters .",
    "this can lead to biasing if the true sky does not also have equal contributions from such parameters .",
    "this effect can be seen clearly by comparing the reconstruction of the synchrotron and free - free components ( figure [ fig : mockfg ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mocksinglepix ] shows histograms of a single pixel chain from the mock sky fit , with the input values of the parameters marked with a bold cross .",
    "the fitting process uses the error information contained in the @xmath107 maps which includes covariance between the @xmath104 and @xmath105 stokes parameters within a pixel , but covariance between pixels ( due to low - frequency noise or the smoothing process ) is not included .",
    "the correlation coefficient between adjacent pixels ranges from less than @xmath129 up to @xmath130 ( for k - band and w - band , respectively ) due to the smoothing process .",
    "the fit treats pixels as independent , essentially marginalizing over all other pixels when fitting , so the main effect of the correlations is to introduce similarly small pixel - pixel correlations in the @xmath31 values .",

    "dust polarization fraction appears to follow a pattern similar to the synchrotron polarization fraction , though the signal - to - noise ratio is low .",
    "this is physically reasonable , as the polarization fraction is largely affected by the coherence of the magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "this implies that the dust intensity times a constant fraction may _ not _ be the best template to use for dust polarization in the galactic plane .",

    "is not improved by the addition of a spinning dust component , and low signal - to - noise regions bias the spinning dust fraction upwards , we regard the spinning dust fraction of the fits above as an upper bound to the overall amount of diffuse spinning dust emission present . as with previous",
    "_ wmap _  fits , this new fitting technique continues to find that spinning dust is a subdominant emission process .",
    "the uncertainties of the fit in the galactic plane preclude cmb analysis for those regions . fortunately , such regions appear to be tightly confined to the plane inside a very narrow sky cut ( 9% of the total sky ) and thus can be excluded without losing much information for cosmological analysis .",
    "the foreground maps from the mcmc fit are similar to those from the mem fit and other foreground templates , which means cmb polarization maps cleaned using such templates will also be similar .    outside of a narrow band on the galactic plane",

    "the variance between the `` base '' fit cmb map and the `` shifted sd '' cmb map is 44.1 @xmath46k@xmath149 outside of the kq85 mask ; variance from one fit to another is generally even smaller for other combinations .",
    "spherical harmonic decomposition did not show these total variances to be strongly focused at any particular multipole , and the numbers are small enough that differences between maps fall within cosmic variance .",
    "the cmb polarization maps produced by the mcmc fit presented in this work are noisy and show some evidence of synchrotron contamination .",
    "nevertheless , the covariance maps from the fits can be used to bound the amount of contamination present , and are available on the lambda website .",
    "these are produced from the ( marginalized ) variance of each parameter over the markov chain for each pixel .",
    "for cosmological analysis a different method is used to marginalize over polarization foregrounds . for",
    "a full description see @xcite .",
    "all of the models so far fit assume that the spectral shape of foreground emission in a @xmath150 pixel can be described as a sum of power - laws or other simple shapes .",
    "this is justified if the observed emission is dominated by a few emission mechanisms which simply combine additively along the line of sight and have minor spatial variation within the beam . in more complex regions of the galaxy ,",
    "however , things may not be so simple .",
    "if two synchrotron regions along the line of sight have their polarization angles oriented nearly orthogonally , then the total polarized emission will be sharply reduced .",
    "if the two regions have different spectral indices then the cancellation in polarization will be maximized at the frequency where the individual polarization amplitudes match , causing a dip in the polarization spectrum .",
    "thus even with pure synchrotron emission the polarization spectrum can look quite different from the temperature spectrum .    to assess this effect 100,000 monte carlo realizations were made of a superposition of two independent randomly oriented synchrotron emitting regions .",
    "parameters for the distribution of intensity and spectral index were chosen to roughly correspond to observations , but the simulation was meant only to provide a generous estimate of how different temperature and polarization behavior could be simply due to multiple synchrotron regions along the line of sight .",
    "the mean spectral index difference was small ( @xmath151 ) but the standard deviation was not insignificant ( @xmath152 ) and the distribution was non - gaussian with high kurtosis ( @xmath153 ) . over @xmath154 of the simulations had an absolute slope difference larger than @xmath155 .",
    "thus we cautiously conclude that while differences between temperature and polarization spectral indices at the @xmath156 level could be quite mundane in origin , consistent differences of @xmath157 or larger are probably _ not _ due to chance alignments in polarization angle and may be caused by an unpolarized non - thermal temperature component .    for the fit",
    ", free - free emission was modeled as a pure power law based on the assumption that the plasma is optically thin . in reality",
    ", regions can become dense enough to become optically thick at frequencies as high as 20 ghz , although such regions are spatially small and do not contribute significantly to the observed emission for a beam as large as _ wmap _ s .",
    "further , to obtain rising flux at k - band requires very high emission measure ( @xmath158 @xmath159pc ) .",
    "even if they were somehow significant , such regions can not explain a steepening spectrum past ka - band .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption can also cause a low - frequency turnover , but the physical parameters necessary for the turnover frequency to lie in or near the _ wmap _  range imply conditions typically only found in active galactic nuclei or other extreme regions .",
    "it may be physically possible for synchrotron radiation from stellar - mass black hole jets or accretion disks to become optically thick at _ wmap _  frequencies , but this phenomenon has yet to be clearly observed and it is unlikely that such emission would contribute significantly at _ wmap _ s resolution .",
    "synchrotron radiation is suppressed when emitted from a region with a refractive index less than unity , such as a plasma .",
    "this is known as the tsytovitch - razin effect , and causes strong suppression of synchrotron emission below @xmath160 hz , where @xmath161 is the electron density ( in @xmath162 ) and @xmath38 the perpendicular component of the magnetic field ( in g ) . for typical galactic electron densities and magnetic fields ,",
    "this cutoff is in the 3300 mhz range , at most . unless energetic electrons play an unexpectedly large role in diffuse emission , _ wmap _",
    "should not see significant tsytovitch - razin suppression .",
    "diffusive synchrotron radiation ( dsr ) differs from an ideal synchrotron spectrum because of the presence of significant random fluctuations in the magnetic field  @xcite . in this model",
    "lower - energy electrons experience small - scale turbulence in the magnetic field structure and follow non - circular paths due to the random deflections . in such models the emission spectrum can turn over from a power law with @xmath7 in the turbulence - dominated diffusive regime to a normal synchrotron spectrum at higher frequencies . while in most models this occurs at low frequencies ,",
    "there is some indication that for pulsar wind nebula the turbulence is relevant up to the ghz range and above @xcite . whether dsr can occur for less compact objects",
    "is not understood at this time .",
    "much has been written on the possible presence of anomalous emission in the lower frequency bands of _ wmap_. there are at least two categories of observations : one is of emission that is diffuse and significant over large portions of the sky outside the galactic plane , and another where the emission is important and perhaps even dominant in specific compact regions .",
    "much evidence for diffuse anomalous emission comes from template correlations @xcite rather than direct fitting of the data ( though for a recent example of the latter , see @xcite ) . characterizing the error and offsets in templates made from data at very different frequencies",
    "has proven challenging .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite show that using an h@xmath41 template to fit _",
    "data results in an improvement of the @xmath0 by 0.016 ( to 2.977 ) , and that the spectrum has a significant `` bump '' . though the improvement seems small , due to the large number of degrees of freedom it is statistically significant , and appears to be robust against the systematic error investigated in that work .",
    "the ka - band excess for select galactic plane pixels ( figure [ fig : funnypol ] ) , however , is in the data alone , independent of any template .",
    "@xcite also find from combining 19 ghz data with _",
    "wmap _  k - band that the galactic plane seems to have antenna temperature falling less steeply than @xmath163 ( i.e. a rising flux spectrum ) .    specifically regarding _ compact _ regions , @xcite previously reported on two regions which might show excess emission in the 1040 ghz range due to spinning dust . cbi observations @xcite failed to find anomalous emission from one , lph96 201.663 + 1.643 ; other authors @xcite had previously raised the possibility that such emission might be due to an optically thick ultracompact region . the other , ldn 1622 ,",
    "was found by @xcite to have a spectral energy distribution consistent with spinning dust , a result driven in part by the lack of flux at 5 ghz found by the parkes - mit - nrao survey of  @xcite .",
    "other surveys at lower frequencies with a larger angular resolution more comparable to _ wmap _ s , however , have not measured a lack of flux ",
    "the 408 mhz data summarized by @xcite measures more flux than _ wmap _  k - band and is consistent with a mixture of power - law thermal and non - thermal components for the region containing ldn 1622 .    separately , @xcite recently observed a sample of northern regions and found no evidence for anomalous emission in any , but observations with the very small array @xcite find some evidence for a 33 ghz excess in snr 3c396 .",
    "thus for compact regions the status of anomalous emission appears to be mixed .",
    "there has been some discussion in the literature of correlation between cmb maps and neutral hydrogen @xcite , but this result was not found to be statistically significant @xcite .",
    "it is quite probable that at least one of the above model complications or additional components is relevant for understanding our galaxy .",
    "more data is needed , particularly in the 5 to 30 ghz range .",
    "further , the inability to measure flux at large angular scales is a problem for many observations , particularly when the angular scale limit depends on the observing frequency .",
    "this continues to make precise comparison of results difficult .",
    "large - scale observations with calibration errors at the percent level or better are needed to address the nature of features seen in some pixels of the galactic plane .    for the _ wmap _",
    "foreground fits the dust spectrum was treated as a pure power law . in reality ,",
    "dust emission in the _ wmap _  bands is probably dominated by a cold component with a low enough temperature that the exponential cutoff is not negligible . however , since the frequency range of _ wmap _ s dust sensitivity is narrow the largest effect of the exponential correction is simply a modification of the apparent power - law index , which for typical cold dust temperatures ( @xmath164 k ) amounts to a change of about @xmath155 in @xmath119 .",
    "this effective bias is therefore small compared to typical errorbars .",
    "however , there are already hints that the extrapolation of dust models to millimeter wavelengths is not entirely satisfactory .    further insight on galactic foregrounds will be obtained from upcoming experiments .",
    "for example , the planck satellite @xcite , scheduled to launched in 2008 , will soon provide more insight on galactic foregrounds . while planck s frequency coverage does not extend low enough to overlap _ wmap _ s k - band",
    ", planck will observe at _ wmap _",
    "s other frequencies with roughly 25% narrower beams and an order of magnitude better sensitivity .",
    "comparison to _ wmap _ s results will be an important check of systematic errors , and the increased sensitivity can help with foreground discrimination , for example by improving knowledge of the spectral index for polarized synchrotron emission .",
    "further , planck has six higher frequency channels in the 100860 ghz range , which will be invaluable for studying dust to a precision several orders of magnitude better than what was available with prior data in this frequency range .",
