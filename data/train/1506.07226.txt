    "mirror symmetry has been a driving force in geometry and physics for more than twenty years .",
    "the first mirror symmetric phenomenon to be discovered mathematically was purely at the level of hodge numbers .",
    "that is , it was noticed that many calabi - yau manifolds pair up in such a way that the hodge diamonds of one is the hodge diamond of the other rotated by a right angle .",
    "one of the earliest sets of examples of this broad phenomenon was discovered by borcea @xcite and voisin @xcite , now known as borcea - voisin manifolds ; distinguishing them by their k3 surfaces , these form a class of 92 members closed under this type of cohomological mirror symmetry .",
    "these are given as resolutions of certain quotients of products of elliptic curves and certain admissible k3 surfaces @xmath0 .",
    "the deeper interest in mirror symmetry on the quantum level originates in the fact that in many cases , the physical observables in string theories defined on mirror background calabi - yau manifolds are identical .",
    "the first example of this to be demonstrated mathematically was the use of mirror symmetry to predict the number of rational curves on certain calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "in particular , givental @xcite and lian , liu and yau @xcite related the gromov - witten invariants from enumerative geometry of one manifold ( encapsulated in a ` j - function ' ) to the periods of the picard - fuchs equation of its mirror ( encapsulated in an ` i - function ' ) .",
    "the methods used in givental s formalism have been applied to establish this deeper form of mirror symmetry for several pairs of families of manifolds @xcite , but not yet the borcea - voisin manifolds whose example had in fact preceded it .",
    "we hope to address this question in this and subsequent articles .    one method of attack is another physical duality altogether called landau - ginzburg ( lg)/calabi - yau ( cy ) correspondence .",
    "different aspects of this physical correspondence have been formalised in a few ways , but the one of most importance here is that produced by @xcite between gromov - witten theory on the calabi - yau side , and fan - jarvis - ruan - witten ( fjrw ) theory on the landau - ginzburg side , both defined for a hypersurface of weighted projective space .",
    "such a relationship has been established already for a number of examples , including the quintic @xcite mirror quintic @xcite , general calabi - yau hypersurfaces @xcite , and in a more general form for the classic calabi - yau three - fold complete intersections @xcite , and hypersurfaces of fano and general type @xcite .",
    "there is a corresponding mirror symmetry for fjrw theory @xcite , known as bergland - hbsch - krawitz ( bhk ) mirror symmetry , forming a square of dualities .",
    "it appears that fjrw theory is often somewhat easier to compute than the calabi - yau theory , and that a promising method of attack to prove calabi - yau mirror symmetry may be via bhk mirror symmetry and the landau - ginzburg duality .    in the case of hypersurfaces of weighted projective spaces",
    ", there is a direct duality between the calabi - yau ` phase ' and the landau - ginzburg phase .",
    "borcea - voisin orbifolds are not hypersurfaces of weighted projective spaces , however , but can be given as complete intersections in quotients of products of weighted projective spaces .",
    "for more general complete intersections of toric varieties , witten proposed an important set of physical models called _ gauged linear sigma models _ ( glsm ) .",
    "a general glsm has a far more complex and interesting phase structure , divided into several chambers , where wall - crossing can be viewed as a generalisation of the lg / cy correspondence .",
    "this has been put on a mathematical footing by fan , jarvis and ruan @xcite . in the case of borcea - voisin orbifolds , this produces four different _ curve - counting theories _ , the original gromov - witten and fjrw theories being two of them .",
    "this should give a potential approach to finding the quantum mirror structure of borcea - voisin orbifolds , via bhk mirror symmetry .",
    "this will be left to subsequent articles . here",
    ", we focus on computations in the a - model .    gromov - witten theory and",
    "its companion theories all come with a state space @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands for the gw , fjrw or mixed theories .",
    "it is endowed with an inner product analogous to the poincar pairing , and a multiplication with identity @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore they are each assigned a moduli space @xmath4 of marked curves endowed with extra structure satisfying certain stability conditions . in gromov - witten theory , the curves are endowed with stable maps to @xmath5,$ ] where @xmath6 . in fjrw theory , they are endowed with line bundles satisfying conditions depending on the polynomial @xmath7 and the group @xmath8 . in the case of interest in this paper , @xmath9 is the complete intersection defined by polynomials @xmath10 .",
    "the mixed theories come from considering the gromov - witten theory of one of the @xmath11 and the fjrw theory of the other , subject to compatibility conditions ; the moduli spaces classify marked curves endowed with a stable map to @xmath12 $ ] and line bundles subject to conditions depending on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and that stable map .",

    ", itself defined fibre - wise as the space of holomorphic differentials over the base curve .",
    "the data for gromov - witten theory and the mixed theories include stable maps from the source curve , and it is helpful for our purposes to specify the homology class @xmath18 of the image of this stable map ; this is not included for the purely fjrw invariants .",

    ", we will find the j - functions of each theory , but it will be simpler to demonstrate the correspondence in terms of i - functions .",
    "however , in this paper we do not address the picard - fuchs equations , so our nomenclature for the i - functions originates solely by analogy from its role in the above mirror theorem ; our computations are all in terms of the a side .    for certain coefficients @xmath26 and",
