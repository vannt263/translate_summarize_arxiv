    "we say that a graph is intrinsically knotted ( respectively , linked ) if every tame embedding of the graph in @xmath4 contains a non - trivially knotted cycle ( respectively , pair of non - trivially linked cycles ) .",
    "robertson , seymour , and thomas  @xcite demonstrated that intrinsic linking is determined by the seven petersen graphs . a graph is intrinsically linked if and only if it is or contains one of the seven as a minor .",

    "foisy s example is particularly interesting from our perspective as it provides a counterexample to the `` unsolved question '' posed in adams  @xcite book : _ is it true that if @xmath7 [ a graph ] is intrinsically knotted and any one vertex and the edges coming into it are removed , the remaining graph is intrinsically linked ? _",
    "while adams conjecture is not true in general , it does appear to hold for a wide array of graphs , particularly graphs that are  almost \" complete .",
    "we will say a graph is * @xmath8-deficient * if it is a complete or complete partite graph with @xmath8 edges removed . in the current article",
    "we verify adams conjecture for @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-deficient graphs .",
    "this can be seen as the first few steps in a project to find a counterexample to adams conjecture of minimum deficiency . however , as foisy s counterexample is @xmath9-deficient , there is a long way to go in this program .",
    "more promising is the search for a counterexample on a minimum number of vertices .",
    "since @xmath5 is a minor minimal intrinsically knotted graph , it is the only graph on @xmath10 or fewer vertices that is intrinsically knotted . in the current paper , we show that there are twenty intrinsically knotted graphs on @xmath3 vertices .",
    "these all satisfy adams conjecture , so a minimal counterexample to the conjecture must have between @xmath11 vertices and the @xmath9 of foisy s graph .",
    "in classifying intrinsic knotting of various families , we have made use of the known minor minimal examples derived from @xmath5 and @xmath6 by triangle - y exchanges .",
    "in particular , we include here a table of the @xmath12 graphs obtained from @xmath6 ( @xcite includes the table built on @xmath5 ) .",
    "note that there are no new examples of minor minimal intrinsically knotted graphs to be found among @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-deficient graphs and graphs on @xmath3 vertices .",

    "we classify the graphs with respect to intrinsic knotting and linking and demonstrate that they satisfy adams conjecture . in section 6",

    "in this section we present some useful lemmas as well as a table of graphs derived from @xmath6 by triangle - y exchanges .",
    "let us begin with some notation .",
    "we will use @xmath16 to denote a complete partite graph with @xmath17 parts containing respectively @xmath18 vertices . permuting the @xmath19 results in the same graph .",
    "we will usually write the parts in descending order : @xmath20 .",
    "the complete graph on @xmath14 vertices is denoted @xmath21 .",
    "recall that a * minor * of a graph @xmath7 is the resultant graph after performing a finite number of vertex or edge deletions and edge contractions on g. an example of an * edge contraction * is shown in figure [ econt ] ( moving from left to right in the figure ) . moving from right to left in the figure",
    "is known as * splitting a vertex*.        we say a graph @xmath7 is * minor minimal * with respect to a property if @xmath7 exhibits the property but no minor of @xmath7 does .",
    "for example , the seven petersen graphs are the only graphs minor minimal with respect to intrinsic linking .",
    "an intrinsically linked graph must either be a petersen graph or contain one as a minor .",
    "the analogous list of graphs for intrinsic knotting is incomplete at this time",
    ". we do know that the list is finite @xcite and if @xmath7 is in the list , so is any graph obtained from @xmath7 by triangle - y exchanges @xcite . to perform a * triangle - y",
    "* exchange on a graph , find 3 vertices that are all connected to one another , delete the three edges between them , and replace with a single vertex connected to all 3 vertices of the triangle .",
    "kohara and suzuki  @xcite have provided a list of the @xmath9 graphs arising from @xmath5 by triangle - y exchanges .",
    "they state that these graphs are minor - minimal with respect to intrinsic knotting and remark that there are @xmath12 graphs that can be constructed from @xmath6 by triangle - y exchanges .",
    "we present these graphs in figure  [ k3311 ] . since foisy  @xcite showed that @xmath6 is intrinsically linked it follows @xcite that all @xmath22 graphs in the figure are minor minimal with respect to intrinsic knotting .     by triangle - y exchanges ]",
    "the graphs in figure  [ k3311 ] are organized into rows having equal numbers of vertices .",
    "the arrows indicate that a triangle - y exchange has occurred .",
    "a dashed arrow means that the triangle - y exchange will result in a different projection of the graph than that shown in the figure .",

    "@xmath24 , and @xmath25 contain no triangles .",
    "most graphs in the figure can be shown to be different from the others by examining the set of vertex degrees .",

    "@xmath30 contains a 5,5,4 triangle .",
    "the two degree 5 vertices in @xmath31 are connected to no common degree 4 vertex so such a triangle is not possible .",
    "@xmath32 contains a triangle ; no triangles exist in @xmath23    these lists of known intrinsically linked or knotted graphs will be one of the two main techniques used in our classifications . if we know that a graph @xmath7 contains a linked ( knotted ) minor , then @xmath7 must also be linked ( knotted ) .",
    "conversely , if we can realize @xmath7 as a minor of an unlinked ( unknotted ) graph , we deduce that @xmath7 must also be unlinked ( unknotted ) .",

    "* proof : * combining the @xmath37 and @xmath38 parts only involves removing edges between vertices in the @xmath37 part and the @xmath38 part .",
    "recall that with complete partite graphs , the ordering of the subscripts is not important , so this lemma implies that we can combine any 2 parts to get a minor of the original graph .    now , suppose we have a complete partite graph with @xmath8 edges removed and we combine two parts .",
    "the result would be a complete partite graph with 1 fewer part and at most @xmath8 edges removed .",
    "furthermore , if there are @xmath39 edges missing between parts @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we can see that @xmath40 edges is a minor of @xmath41 edges .",
