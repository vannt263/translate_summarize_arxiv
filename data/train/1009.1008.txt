    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) began colliding protons at a centre - of - mass energy of 7  tev at the end of march 2010 .",
    "in the subsequent months , the luminosity has increased more or less exponentially : approximately 16  had been delivered to each experiment at the start of the beach2010 workshop , and at the time of writing these proceedings this has risen to approximately 2  .",
    "production of charmed hadrons is a natural topic to probe with these data samples : the cross sections are large enough to make precise measurements even with limited data samples , and early studies on charm distributions will improve our understanding of hadronic events at the lhc for subsequent analyses .",
    "it is anticipated that @xmath0 will be delivered during the 2010 run , and @xmath1 in 2011  @xcite . in this note",
    ", we discuss the status of measurements of the cross section for prompt production of open and hidden charm mesons in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3  tev in bins of rapidity @xmath4 and transverse momentum @xmath5 .",
    "charm and beauty hadrons are light compared to the collision energy at the lhc , so their production is concentrated in the forward region .",
    "this motivates the design of lhcb  @xcite , a single - arm forward spectrometer , which instruments the angular range @xmath6  mrad and @xmath7  mrad , corresponding to approximately @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the @xmath11 and @xmath4 projections of the polar angle , @xmath12 is the pseudorapidity , and the @xmath13-axis corresponds to the nominal beam direction .",
    "this coverage is complementary to the other large lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "the lhcb detector includes a silicon microstrip vertex locator ( velo ) which is positioned at 5  mm from the beam during data - taking ; five downstream tracking stations which use a combination of silicon pixels and drift chambers ; two ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detectors with three different radiators to cover the momentum range @xmath14  gev@xmath15 ; a calorimeter consting of a scintillator pad detector ( spd ) to detect charged particles , an electromagnetic calorimeter with a preshower detector , and a hadronic calorimeter ; five muon stations ; and a magnet with a field integral of 4  tm .",
    "results at the beach2010 conference were presented with samples of 214  .",
    "where available , equivalent plots from larger data samples have been substituted in these proceedings .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the data is an essential input to cross section measurements .",
    "the approach used at lhcb is to calibrate quantities which are expected to be proportional to the instantaneous luminosity , such as the number of hits in the spd , with runs in which the luminosity is measured directly .",
    "these calibrations can then be used to determine the integrated luminosity for a much larger data sample .",
    "two methods have been used to establish the instantaneous luminosity .",
    "first , the profiles of the beams can be measured directly in the velo using beam - gas events , which are recorded continuously by the lhcb trigger at a low rate for calibration purposes .",
    "given the bunch - crossing frequency and beam currents , the luminosity can then be inferred  @xcite .",
    "second , a dedicated run can be used for a van der meer scan  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity when calibrated in this way at lhcb is estimated to be 10% at present .",
    "( upper , 260  ) and @xmath16 ( lower , 150  ) . the @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonances are visible .",

    "the production mechanisms for bound states at hadron colliders are still far from understood ; neither the colour singlet model nor the colour octet model fully describes the existing experimental data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the total cross section , the @xmath5 spectrum , and the polarization of @xmath19 states are all of interest for probing this problem .",
    "lhcb sees large signals for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and a smaller but significant signal for @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsi_mass ] ) .",
    "we can divide charmonium at the lhc into two classes : those produced at an event primary vertex ( prompt ) , either directly or in the decay of a short - lived resonance such as a heavier @xmath23 state , and those produced in the decay of a long - lived @xmath24 hadron ( secondary ) .",
    "lhcb plans to measure the cross section as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for both classes of production separately .",
    "the two cases can be distinguished using the pseudo - proper - lifetime @xmath25 of the decay , defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the projection in the @xmath13 direction of the distance between the decay vertex and the associated event primary vertex , @xmath28 is the reconstructed invariant mass , and @xmath29 is the @xmath13 component of the momentum . for prompt production ,",
    "@xmath25 is described by a narrow peak at zero with width equal to the resolution ; for secondary production , it is described by an exponential with effective lifetime approximately equal to the average @xmath30-hadron proper lifetime .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath17 in fig.[fig : jpsi_tz ] .",
    "the fit also includes a component for combinatoric background , determined from a mass sideband above the @xmath17 .",
    "the data clearly require a secondary component to be present .    [",

    "firm conclusions can not be drawn without systematic uncertainties , but these initial results illustrate the potential improvements from retuning the monte carlo generator with early data .",

    "both prompt and secondary production are expected at lhcb . however , because the @xmath35 , @xmath37 , and @xmath39 fly a significant distance at lhcb , separating the two sources is more complicated .",
    "the discriminating variable used is the impact parameter ( ip ) of the @xmath40 candidate with respect to the associated event primary vertex ",
    "prompt charm points back to the primary vertex and so its ip distribution is dominated by the resolution , whereas secondary charm in general has a much larger ip .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ fig : charmlogip ] . by fitting both the invariant mass spectrum and the @xmath41 distribution , the production rate of prompt",
    "charm mesons can be measured .",
    "inclusive cross section measurements in bins of @xmath42 and @xmath4 using this technique are now underway .",

    ", lhcb will be able to search for new physics in charm decays .",
    "three key analyses will be measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 and  @xmath46 ; searches for direct cp violation in @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; and a search for @xmath49 .",
    "these studies will benefit greatly from the combination of copious charm production , a large boost ( especially valuable for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , and excellent charged particle identification across the full momentum range .",
