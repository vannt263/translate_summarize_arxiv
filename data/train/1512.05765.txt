    "la__coo@xmath2 has different crystal symmetry , and has previously been investigated extensively , we omit _ _ la__coo@xmath2 in this study .    to examine the performance of widely used exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals , we computed the structural parameters of _ _ r__coo@xmath2 using the local density approximation ( lda ) , generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , lda+@xmath29 , and gga+@xmath29 . the self - consistent hubbard @xmath0 of low - spin co ( @xmath29 ) for both lda and gga are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : us](b ) .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath29 slightly increases with the atomic number , i.e. @xmath29 increases with decreasing ionic radius or unit cell volume .",
    "such a trend is consistent with the slight increase of @xmath29 with hydrostatic pressure observed in iron - bearing minerals.@xcite fig .",

    "it is known that lda usually underestimates lattice constants , while the gga functional usually overestimates them , providing lower and upper bounds for the predicted volume . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct](a ) , the equilibrium volumes observed in experiments are indeed within the range bounded by lda and gga calculations . for both cases , the computed @xmath37 increases with the inclusion of the hubbard @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : struct](c ) shows , however , that the resulting average co - o distance @xmath41 is nearly constant along the rare - earth series .",

    "the band gap ( _ e@xmath48 _ ) increases by @xmath49 ev ( @xmath50% ) along the series from pr to lu .",
    "for some _ _",

    "therefore , the electronic properties are not properly described in calculations without u , although the effect of adding _ u _ is small with regard to structural parameters .    moving on from the band gap , fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](d ) further shows that the @xmath18 ( @xmath13-derived ) bandwidth ( @xmath51 ) , the @xmath14 bandwidth ( @xmath52 ) , and the crystal field splitting ( @xmath5 ) , are also dependent on the rare - earth cation .",
    "the definitions of these parameters are illustrated in figures  [ fig : dos](a , e ) and their relation with @xmath53 is clarified in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](e ) .",
    "it should be noted here that we define @xmath5 as the splitting between the midpoints of the @xmath13- and @xmath14-derived bands , and that in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](d ) both the lda+u@xmath44 and gga+u@xmath44 values are shown for each quantity , with the region between them shaded or colored . examining the results , from pr through lu , @xmath51 decreases ( by @xmath170.5 ev ) , while @xmath52 and @xmath5 increase , by @xmath170.45 and @xmath170.37 ev , respectively .",
    "it is revealing to compare these values and trends to simple expectations . while @xmath51 indeed decreases with increasing deviation from 180@xmath43 co - o - co bond angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct](d ) ) , it should be noted that @xmath5 is _ not _ constant as might naively be expected from the approximately constant co - o bond length ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct](c ) ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath52 , which might naively be viewed as negligible in comparison to @xmath51 in a simple picture,@xcite actually significantly exceeds @xmath51 . this latter feature has been seen in several first principles electronic structure calculations.@xcite    it is insightful to consider the impact of the above on simple arguments made for the evolution of @xmath16 , as summarized in the introduction . within a simple treatment ,",
    "this onset temperature for the spin crossover can be viewed as proportional to a spin gap energy,@xcite @xmath54 , where @xmath15 is the intra - atomic hund exchange energy of co in an octahedral environment . as mentioned in the introduction , in the picture advanced by tachibana _ et .",
    "al._,@xcite the increasing spin gap with decreasing rare - earth ionic size is then rationalized by assuming an invariant @xmath15 and @xmath5 , a negligible @xmath52 , and a @xmath51 that decreases from pr to lu .",
    "though we have not calculated @xmath15 , the clear issues from our calculated values are that @xmath52 is not negligible ( it in fact exceeds @xmath51 and also depends on the rare - earth cation ) , and that @xmath5 , contrary to simple expectations , is not constant .",
    "it thus appears that the simple rationalization of the trend in @xmath16 across the series _ _ pr__coo@xmath2 to _ _",
    "lu__coo@xmath2 is not straightforwardly borne out by a detailed electronic band structure picture .",
    "however , simply inserting band structure results for these quantities into the simple approximated expression for the spin gap given above is likely hazardous .",
    "specifically , this approach does not capture the nature of localized spin excitations in these strongly correlated systems .",
    "one potentially more accurate approach would be to calculate the energies associated with single spin excitations@xcite in these compounds .",
    "the results shown above , which demonstrate how the crystal and electronic structures can be properly reproduced in these materials , should form a solid basis for such calculations .",

    "alternatively , one can `` push '' the 4__f _ _ electrons far away from fermi level by applying large _ u _ values , so that the structural and electronic properties of _ _",
    "r__coo@xmath2 s related with co 3__d _ _ states will not depend on 4__f _ _ electron details .",
    "this approach suffers from the difficulty of converging calculations , however .",
    "with 4 rare - earth ions in the unit cell , orbital and spin degrees of freedom in an incomplete _ f_-shell give rise to a huge number of inequivalent configurations with similar energies , and hence make calculations extremely difficult to converge using currently implemented mixing schemes in the quantum espresso code . due to such difficulties , we favor placing the 4__f _ _ electrons in the pseudopotential core , as long as their properties are not under scrutiny .    in fig .",

    "<S> using density functional theory plus self - consistent hubbard @xmath0 ( dft@xmath1 ) calculations , we have investigated the structural and electronic properties of the rare - earth cobaltites _ _ r__coo@xmath2 ( _ r _ = pr  lu ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show the evolution of crystal and electronic structure of the insulating low - spin ( ls ) _ _ r__coo@xmath2 with increasing rare - earth atomic number ( decreasing ionic radius ) , including the invariance of the co - o bond distance ( @xmath3 ) , the decrease of the co - o - co bond angle ( @xmath4 ) , and the increase of the crystal field splitting ( @xmath5 ) and band gap energy ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> agreement with experiment for the latter improves considerably with the use of dft@xmath1 and all trends are in good agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> these trends enable a direct test of prior rationalizations of the trend in spin - gap associated with the spin crossover in this series , which is found to expose significant issues with simple band based arguments . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the effect of placing the rare - earth _ </S>",
    "<S> f_-electrons in the core region of the pseudopotential . </S>",
    "<S> the effect on lattice parameters and band structure is found to be small , but distinct for the special case of _ _ pr__coo@xmath2 where some _ f_-states populate the middle of the gap , consistent with recent reports of unique behavior in pr - containing cobaltites . </S>",
    "<S> overall , this study establishes a foundation for future predictive studies of thermally induced spin excitations in rare - earth cobaltites and similar systems . </S>"
