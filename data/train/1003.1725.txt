    "the process of gravitational collapse has been studied since about 60 years ago as a solution of einstein field equations .",
    "when a sufficiently massive star many times the size of the sun exhausts its nuclear fuel without reaching an equilibrium state such as a neutron star or white dwarf , it collapses under its own pull of gravity at the end of its life cycle .",
    "therefore , gravity overtakes and dominates the other three forces of nature , in particular , the weak and strong nuclear forces , which generically provide the outward pressure in a star to balance it against the inward pull of gravity . in such ultra - strong gravity regions",
    "the densities and spacetime curvature diverge and a spacetime singularity will be born , either hidden within an event horizon ( a black hole ) or visible to the external universe ( a naked singularity ) , as predicted by the singulary theorems in general relativity .",
    "the visibility or otherwise of the singularity to outside observers is determined by the causal structure of the dynamically developing collapsing cloud as governed by the einstein s field equations .",
    "when the internal dynamics of the collapse delays the formation of the horizon , the singularity becomes visible , and may communicate physical effects to the external universe @xcite .",
    "up until now a great deal of effort has gone into the study of the nature of singularities and large classes of the solutions of einstein s field equations treating singularities have been represented . the general and exact class of solutions of einstein s field equations describing spherically symmetric pressureless matter ( dust ) for motion with no particle layers intersecting , independent of the homogeneity assumption , was originally introduced by lema@xmath3tre @xcite in an attempt to describe cosmology , which was further developed and studied by tolman @xcite and bondi @xcite .",
    "this class could be used to model the gravitational collapse of matter from general inhomogeneous initial conditions and the end state of gravitational collapse of a massive star can be studied within this framework @xcite .",
    "contrary to the collapsing friedmann case , in which the physical singularity occurs at a constant epoch of time , namely at @xmath4 , the singular epoch ( the time @xmath5 at which the area radius of the collapsing shell of matter at a constant value of the co - moving coordinate r vanishes ) in ltb model is a function of r as a result of inhomogeneity in the matter distribution .",
    "this model can exhibit two kinds of naked singularity : a shell - crossing @xcite and a shell - focussing singularity @xcite .",
    "these kinds of naked singularity are generic for spherical dust collapse and with proper choice of initial data they are globally naked .",
    "the main reason which causes this model to be deficient is that it neglects the pressure , which is likely to diverge at these singularities ( where the density diverges ) @xcite . a special case of these classes of solutions which has served as the basic paradigm in black hole physics is the oppenheimer - synder study of a completely homogeneous , pressure - free and spherically symmetric dust cloud collapse , where a dust cloud undergoes a continued collapse which commences from regular initial data ( i.e.",
    ", there is no trapped surfaces forming at the initial spacelike surface from which the collapse begins and the light rays can escape from the surface of the star to faraway observers ) to form a black hole @xcite .",
    "most of our knowledge about the gravitational collapse is still based on that model .",
    "also it describes well the formation of the horizon and evolution of the central , space - like singularity .",
    "oppenheimer and snyder analyzed the causal structure of the solution by considering in particular an observer on the surface of the dust cloud sending signals to a faraway stationary observer at regularly spaced intervals as measured by his own clock .",
    "they discovered that as the radius of the dust cloud approaches @xmath6 , the spacing between the arrival times of these signals to the faraway observer becomes progressively longer , tending to infinity .",
    "this effect has since been called the infinite redshift effect .",
    "the observer on the surface of the dust cloud may keep sending signals after its radius has become less than @xmath6 , but these signals can not escape from this region since the speed of light is the limiting propagation velocity for physical signals . within a finite affine parameter interval ,",
    "these signals reach a true singularity at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this singularity is formed inside a black hole , as a final state of the collapse process and also accords to the concept of the cosmic censorship .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture which is initially represented by penrose @xcite , explain the properties of the final singularity of a gravitational collapse .",
    "the main result of this conjecture is that , all spacetime singularities arising from regular initial data that appear in a gravitational collapse ( in an asymptotically flat universe ) are always surrounded by an event horizon and hence invisible to outside observers ( no naked singularities ) .",
    "moreover in the strong version of this conjecture , such singularities are not even locally naked , i.e. there is not any timelike or null geodesics which can emerge from these singularities and go to future infinity @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis plays a fundamental role in both the theory and applications of black hole physics and has been recognized as one of the most important open problems in classical general theory of relativity . up to now many exact solutions of einstein s field equations with several kinds of field - sources which admit naked singularities depending upon the nature of the initial data and the kinematical properties near the singularity",
    "have been considered .",
    "the models studied so far include the collapse of scalar fields @xcite as well as other matter sources including dust @xcite , radiation @xcite , perfect fluid @xcite , imperfect fluids @xcite , and null strange quark fluids @xcite .",
    "one would like to inquire about what are the possible physical factors operating during the process of a continual collapse of a massive matter cloud which results in the formation of a naked singularity or a black hole as the collapse end state .",
    "such an investigation should help us understand much better the physics of black holes and naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that for the spherical dust collapse the shearing effects and inhomogeneity present within the collapsing cloud do play a crucial role in delaying the formation of the trapped surfaces and the apparent horizon .",
    "these effects could in fact make the geometry of apparent and event horizons distorted sufficiently , which exposes the singularity to the external observers @xcite .",
    "general relativity is not the only gravitational theory which explain the gravitational phenomena .",
    "there are alternative theories of gravity that can explain the gravitational phenomena and lead to many interesting results and physical interpretations .",
    "one of those , is the scalar - tensor theory of gravity , which has been actively studied as an alternative and successful theory of gravity .",
    "recently , they have attracted much attention , in part because they emerge naturally as the low - energy limit of many theories of quantum gravity , such as kaluza - klein theories@xcite and supersymmetric string theories@xcite .",
    "these theories are also important for `` extended '' cosmological inflation models@xcite , in which the scalar field allows the inflationary epoch to end via bubble nucleation without the need for fine - tuning cosmological parameters(the `` graceful exit '' problem)@xcite . in brans - dicke theory , the simplest of scalar - tensor theories , gravitation is described by a metric @xmath8 and a scalar field @xmath9 coupled to both matter and space time geometry which obeys a wave equation with a source term determined by the matter distribution .",
    "gravitational collapse in this theory has been studied in some of the recent literature . in this paper",
    "we study the formation of naked singularity as the end state of gravitational collapse of a matter fluid obeying the barotropic equation of state , @xmath0 in the context of brans - dicke ( bd ) theory .",
    "being motivated by this concept , we investigate the violation of cosmic censorship conjecture in the collapse procedure of such a matter fluid .",

    "since the presence of matter acting as a `` seed '' field and origin of spherical symmetry , prompts the collapse of bd scalar field , we have considered perfect fluid models with barotropic equation of state being given by @xmath30 using the continuity equation for the matter and eq .",

    "@xmath37 the quantity @xmath38 arises as a free function from the integration of einstein s equation and can be interpreted physically as the total mass of the collapsing cloud within a coordinate radius r with @xmath39 ,  and @xmath40 being the area radius for the shell labeled by the comoving coordinate @xmath28 . from eq .",
