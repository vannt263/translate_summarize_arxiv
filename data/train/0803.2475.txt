    "in this talk i would like to describe some remarkable progress that has been made in the past few years in understanding the structure of gauge boson scattering amplitudes in a particular gauge theory , @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory . while this theory differs in many details from the electroweak and qcd theories",
    "whose radiative corrections were the subject of this symposium , there are many common issues , particularly associated with infrared structure .",
    "indeed , the understanding of infrared divergences in qcd acquired over the last few decades has proved extremely useful in unraveling some of the structure of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "@xmath0 super - yang - mills theory is the most supersymmetric theory possible without gravity . in the free theory , starting from the helicity @xmath2 massless gauge boson ( `` gluon '' ) state , the four supercharges can be used to lower the helicity by @xmath3 units , until the helicity @xmath4 gluon state is reached .",
    "if one had more supercharges , one would need spin @xmath5 states , and it is not known how to quantize such theories in a unitary way without including at least spin 2 gravitons . along the way from the helicity @xmath2 to the helicity @xmath4 gluon state , one passes through the 4 massless ( majorana ) spin @xmath6 gluinos , and 6 real ( or 3 complex ) massless",
    "spin @xmath7 scalars . in this maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( msym ) , all the massless states are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , which we will take to be @xmath8 .",
    "the interactions are all uniquely specified by the choice of gauge group , and one dimensionless gauge coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the theory is an exactly scale - invariant , conformal field theory ; that is , the beta function vanishes identically for all values of the coupling  @xcite .    here we will consider the t hooft limit of msym , in which the number of colors @xmath10 , with the t hooft parameter @xmath11 held fixed  @xcite . in this limit , only planar feynman diagrams contribute .",
    "also , the anti - de sitter space / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) duality  @xcite suggests that for @xmath10 the weak - coupling perturbation series in @xmath12 might have some very special properties .",
    "the reason is that , according to ads / cft , the strongly - coupled ( large @xmath12 ) limit of the four - dimensional conformal gauge theory has an equivalent description in terms of a weakly - coupled string theory .",
    "the intuition is that the perturbative series should know about this simple strong - coupling limit , and organize itself accordingly  @xcite .",
    "sketches how events such as gluon scattering look in the ads / cft duality  @xcite .",
    "five - dimensional anti - de sitter space , ads@xmath13 , contains , besides the usual four - dimensional space - time @xmath14 , an additional radial variable @xmath15 , which corresponds to a resolution scale in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "large values of @xmath15 correspond to the ultraviolet ( uv ) region ; small values to the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the figure shows a `` big '' glueball state in the ir , and a `` small '' glueball state in the uv .",
    "the arrows represent the motion of plane - wave single gluon states in @xmath14 for @xmath16 scattering at @xmath17 .",
    "we ll discuss the motion in @xmath15 later .",
    "the radius of curvature of ads@xmath13 is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "large @xmath12 means that the space - time is only weakly curved , which makes it much simpler to study the string theory ; higher excitations of the string can usually be neglected .    the ads / cft duality is a weak / strong duality .",
    "quantities that can be computed at weak coupling in one picture have a strong - coupling description in the other picture .",
    "this property makes ads / cft both powerful and difficult to check explicitly  although there is certainly convincing evidence in its favor .",
    "there are a few quantities that are known ( modulo a few assumptions ) to all orders in @xmath12 ; that is , for which one can interpolate all the way from weak to strong coupling .",
    "notable among these is the cusp ( or soft ) anomalous dimension @xmath19 . the qcd version of this quantity crops up a lot in soft - gluon resummation .",
    "beisert , eden and staudacher  @xcite have given an all - orders proposal for @xmath19 , based on integrability , plus a number of other properties .",
    "their proposal is consistent with the first four loops in the weak - coupling expansion  @xcite , and also agrees  @xcite with the first three terms in the strong - coupling expansion  @xcite .    in this talk",
    "i would like to discuss the evidence for another proposal  @xcite , namely that gluon - gluon scattering @xmath16 in msym , for any scattering angle @xmath20 can be fully specified by just three functions of @xmath12 , independent of @xmath20 .",
    "one of these three functions is already `` known '' , because it is just @xmath19 .",
    "this proposal has received some confirmation at strong coupling , through the work of alday and maldacena  @xcite .",
    "it was motivated by the structure of ir divergences in gauge theory .",
    "in a conformal field theory , scale invariance implies that the interactions never shut off , so that a scattering process can not really be defined .",
    "while strictly speaking this is true , we are able to get around it in practice by regulating the theory in the ir .",
    "we ll use dimensional regularization with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( actually a version of it that preserves all the supersymmetry  @xcite ) .",
    "the regulator breaks the conformal invariance , but we can recover it by performing a laurent expansion around @xmath23 , up to and including the @xmath24 terms .",
    "at one loop , there are two types of ir divergences : _ soft_-gluon exchange , in which the virtual gluon energy @xmath25 ; and _ collinear _ regions , in which the gluon s transverse momentum ( with respect to a massless external line ) @xmath26 . the soft and collinear regions each produce a @xmath27 pole , resulting in a @xmath28 leading behavior for on - shell amplitudes at one loop . at @xmath29 loops ,",
    "the leading behavior is @xmath30 , coming from multiple soft - gluon exchange that is arranged hierarchically , so that the outermost gluons are softer and more collinear than the innermost ones .",
    "in fact , all the pole terms for @xmath29-loop amplitudes are predictable in planar gauge theory , thanks to decades of work on the soft / collinear factorization and exponentiation of amplitudes , and of quark and gluon form factors , in qcd  @xcite . for both qcd and msym , in the planar limit",

    "the dual momentum variables @xmath145 play a prominent role in the strong - coupling computation of alday and maldacena , which is essentially the same as computing a wilson loop vacuum expectation value at strong coupling .",
    "inspired by this connection , there has been a sequence of recent wilson - loop computations for loops corresponding to the dual - momentum boundary conditions for an @xmath51-point amplitude , namely polygons composed of @xmath51-light - like segments , with corners obeying  .",
    "the first of these computations was by drummond , korchemsky and sokatchev  @xcite , for the one - loop expectation value of a quadrilateral ( @xmath74 ) wilson loop .",
    "up to constants of the kinematics , attributable to a different regulator ( in the uv ) than the one used for the amplitudes ( in the ir ) , the expectation value agreed , surprisingly , with the one - loop four - gluon amplitude , normalized by the tree amplitude , _ i.e. _ .",
    "next , brandhuber , heslop and travaglini  @xcite showed that the same statement is actually true for the @xmath51-gon wilson loop for any @xmath51 , compared with the normalized one - loop amplitude  @xcite for the so - called maximally - helicity - violating ( mhv ) configuration of gluon helicities ( two negative and @xmath146 positive ) .",
    "the wilson - loop computation knows nothing about the polarizations of the external gluons .",
    "it is manifestly symmetric under cyclic permutations and reflections of the polygon . for @xmath74 and 5 ,",
    "a ward identity for @xmath0 supersymmetry shows that all helicity configurations in msym are equivalent , and that the normalized amplitudes have the same manifest symmetries as the polygonal wilson loop  @xcite .",
    "however , beyond @xmath75 there are non - mhv configurations which do not have these symmetries . how does the wilson loop know it is `` supposed to '' match the mhv amplitude alone ?",
    "drummond , henn , korchemsky and sokatchev ( dhks ) then repeated the wilson - loop computation in msym at two loops , first for the @xmath74 case  @xcite and then for the @xmath75 case  @xcite .",
    "again the results matched the full two - loop msym scattering amplitudes  @xcite , up to constants of the kinematics .",
    "furthermore , dhks first proposed  @xcite and then proved  @xcite an anomalous dual conformal ward identity for wilson loops , in which the anomaly arises from uv divergences proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "the solution to the ward identity is unique for @xmath74 and 5 . beyond @xmath75 , there are multiple solutions , due to the existence of nontrivial conformally - invariant cross ratios . for example , for @xmath147 the quantity @xmath148 is invariant under the inversion  ( [ inversionsym ] ) , and there are two other such cross ratios .",
    "( the appearance of @xmath149 in a cross ratio is forbidden by the on - shell constraint @xmath150 . )",
    "dhks also showed that the amplitude ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) obeys the anomalous dual conformal ward identity .",
    "given that the ansatz was known to be correct for @xmath74 and 5  @xcite , and the uniqueness of the ward identity solution for these cases , this result could explain why the amplitude should match the wilson loop in these cases .",
    "however , it was not clear what should happen for larger @xmath51",
    ". indeed , alday and maldacena  @xcite gave an argument , based on approximating a euclidean rectangular loop by a zig - zag configuration composed of many light - like segments , that the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) should fail at strong coupling for sufficiently large @xmath51 .",
    "dhks  @xcite found that the hexagonal wilson loop could _ not _ be described at two loops by the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) .",
    "this result left open the question , however , of whether the ansatz failed to describe mhv amplitudes beyond @xmath75 , or whether the relation between amplitudes and wilson loops failed beyond two loops ( or both ) .",
    "the high - energy limits of the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) have been examined for consistency with expected regge behavior . for @xmath74 and 5 , the ansatz appears to have consistent behavior in all such limits  @xcite however , there appears to be a difficulty with the ansatz for the six - gluon amplitude starting at two loops  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a computation of the `` parity even '' part of the six - gluon mhv amplitude  @xcite has revealed directly that the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) does fail for @xmath147 .",
    "however , a numerical comparison  @xcite with the corresponding hexagonal wilson loop  @xcite shows that the mhv - amplitude - wilson - loop equivalence is still intact at two loops and @xmath147 .",
    "this result means that the scattering amplitude also obeys the dual conformal ward identity . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution to the ward identity is not unique for @xmath147 .",
    "hence some other principle , as yet unidentified , is needed to explain why mhv amplitudes are equivalent to wilson loops in msym .",
    "we have seen that gluon scattering amplitudes in planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory have some remarkable properties .",
    "it appears that the exact forms of the four - gluon and five - gluon amplitudes are given by the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) , which depends only on four different functions of the large-@xmath1 coupling parameter @xmath12 : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "because an exact solution for one of the four functions  @xmath151 , the cusp anomalous dimension  seems to be in hand  @xcite , perhaps one can say that these cases are `` @xmath155 solved '' .",
    "the fixed dependence of the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) on the scattering angle(s ) is apparently related to the uniqueness of solutions to a dual conformal ward identity for @xmath74 and 5  @xcite , and an equivalence between ( mhv ) amplitudes and wilson lines  @xcite .",
    "although the ansatz  ( [ bdsansatz ] ) fails for the mhv six - gluon amplitude  @xcite at two loops , the equivalence remains valid  @xcite .",
    "there are still many open questions .",
    "are there simple(r ) ads / operator interpretations of the other three functions ?",
    "can one find integral equations for them , based on integrability ?",
    "what is the precise relation between integrability and dual conformal invariance ?",
    "do non - mhv amplitudes obey any simple patterns , or bear any relation to wilson loop expectation values ?",
    "from the structure of the one - loop amplitudes , _ e.g. _ for six gluons  @xcite , any such relations must be considerably more intricate .",
    "what happens in other conformal theories ? finally , we can hope that some of these advances may eventually help to shed light on scattering amplitudes in other gauge theories , particularly qcd , whose understanding  as exemplified by the other talks at this symposium  is vital to the search for new physics at the large hadron collider .    0.4 cm",
