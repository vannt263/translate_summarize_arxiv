    "galactic winds are an important but poorly understood aspect of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "winds are observed locally ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but are probably more important at high redshift where star formation and the subsequent supernovae occur at the fastest rate .",
    "winds have been invoked as an important force for forming galaxies @xcite , and more recently their effects have been proposed as a solution to various problems related to galaxy formation , from the suppression of star formation in low mass halos ( now the dark dwarf satellites predicted to orbit galaxies like the milky way ; e.g. , @xcite ) , to the metal pollution of the intergalactic medium ( hereafter , igm ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "luminous , star - forming galaxies at high redshift , or lyman break galaxies ( hereafter , lbgs ) show evidence of outflows in their spectra @xcite with velocities of up to 1000 @xmath4 .    such outflows may not only affect star formation within the galaxy , but may potentially impact the surrounding intergalactic gas as well .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported a `` galaxy proximity effect '' in the igm around lbgs .",
    "the effect consists of an increase in the ly@xmath0  transmitted flux within a comoving transverse separation of @xmath5 and at the redshift of the lbg as measured on a parallel line of sight probed by a quasar .",
    "this is contrary to the expected _ decrease _ of transmitted flux ( or increased absorption ) owing to increased gas density in the vicinity of a galaxy predicted by the gravitational instability model , which has been observed at low redshift ( e.g. , morris et al .",
    "1993 ; lanzetta et al .  1995",
    "; chen et al .",
    "@xcite interpreted their observations as indicating the effects of galactic super - winds that would have either swept up the absorbing gas , or otherwise heated it sufficiently to remove its absorption signature entirely .",
    "the strength of a galactic wind required to remove all of the hydrogen ly@xmath0  absorption from the region surrounding a galaxy is , however , more extreme than one might at first guess .",
    "the absorbing hydrogen must be removed at least out to the turnaround radius of the galactic halo because the peculiar velocity of any gas at that distance will bring its ly@xmath0  absorption line to the same redshift as the galaxy , and the gas density at the turnaround radius is typically already considerably larger than the mean density of the universe , enough to cause strong absorption . in a galactic halo with velocity dispersion @xmath6 , the material that has formed the galaxy",
    "must originally have collapsed by falling from the turnaround radius with a velocity @xmath7 during the age of the universe , @xmath8 .",
    "hence , a wind of lifetime @xmath9 must move out at a velocity @xmath10 to reach out to the same radius and sweep all the gas away .",
    "an exact calculation for a spherical top - hat perturbation in which the halo velocity dispersion remains constant with time yields a minimum wind velocity of @xmath11 to reach the turnaround radius , or even larger if the halo velocity dispersion increases with time , as is the case for most halos in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . in practice",
    ", the wind lifetime should be a small fraction of the age of the universe because the wind removes the gas falling onto the halo from large distances that is needed to sustain a long period of star formation .",
    "this implies that the wind must have moved at a `` hyper - escape '' velocity : the wind must reach the turnaround radius ( already the intergalactic region surrounding the halo ) and still be moving at a speed larger than the halo velocity dispersion . in other words",
    ", the expelled gases would actually have to be the debris from an explosion , rather than a self - regulated wind in which the gas is expelled at the speed required to escape the potential well of the halo .",
    "it appears unlikely that this type of explosion would generally have occurred in all high - redshift lbgs , both because we would expect winds from star - forming galaxies to be self - regulated ( in other words , the star formation rate should decrease as a wind is able to expel the infalling gas that feeds the star formation ) and because of the enormous energy required to remove the absorbing gas out to more than @xmath12 from lbgs @xcite . because the observational result is based on only a few galaxies , one must be cautious with this interpretation .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that an increased transmitted flux near galaxies , at the level observed by @xcite , is only produced by extreme feedback models .",
    "a thermal feedback effect is too weak to sufficiently reduce the absorption of the dense gas near a galaxy @xcite .",
    "simple wind models in which lbgs were associated with massive galaxies at high redshift @xcite have shown that gas must be affected at unrealistically large distances from galaxies to result in increased ly@xmath0  transmission .",
    "more sophisticated wind model prescriptions @xcite do not match the observations of @xcite either .",
    "photoionization by a massive galaxy itself does not produce an intensity of ionizing radiation that is large compared to the cosmic background @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of galactic winds on model predictions for the statistics of the transmitted flux of the ly@xmath0  forest close to the galaxies from which the winds originate . to date",
    ", these predictions have not been made using eulerian cosmological simulations , although @xcite do check the robustness of their hpm runs using simulations of the type presented here .",
    "we explore the effect of winds using this type of simulation @xcite , which treat winds very differently from previous studies .",
    "furthermore , we are able to probe the wind effects directly since we compare three different simulations in which only the wind strength is varied .",
    "we also make predictions for new statistical measures of the ly@xmath0  absorption near galaxies that may help better compare observations and theory . in ",
    "2 we describe the simulations , including their star formation and wind prescriptions and our methods of identifying galaxies in the simulation and of analyzing the ly@xmath0  forest near them . in ",
    "3 we present a picture of the physical conditions of the igm in the presence of feedback . in ",
    "4 we quantify this picture and present our main results for the flux statistics from our simulations , and we compare our predictions with recent observations .",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss our results in  5 .",
    "we analyze the outputs at @xmath1 of four eulerian simulations of a @xmath13-cdm universe .",
    "these simulations are all improved versions of the original simulations by @xcite described in detail in cen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and in the other papers by this group . in order to understand the effect of galactic winds on our results ,",
    "we analyze three simulations of a lcdm cosmology that differ in the amount of energy that is assumed to be released by supernovae .",
    "the cosmological parameters of all three simulations are @xmath14 , each of size @xmath15 comoving on a side with @xmath16 cells .",
    "the different amounts of input supernova energy allow us to test directly the effect of winds produced by supernovae on our predictions for galaxy - ly@xmath0  forest correlations .",
    "we distinguish the three simulation boxes by the designations `` l11-low '' , `` l11-medium '' , and `` l11-high '' where these correspond to input supernova efficiencies ( see below , eq .",
    "[ esn ] ) of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we analyze a large box of size @xmath20 on a side with @xmath21 cells and feedback parameter @xmath22 .",
    "this large box has similar resolution as the other three simulations , but the finite box size effects on the galaxy - ly@xmath0  forest correlations should be less severe than in the other three simulations , allowing for a more direct comparison to the observations of adelberger et al .",
    "we refer to this box as `` l25 '' .",
    "a summary of the simulations and parameters is given in table 1 .",
    "baryonic mass in overdense regions of the simulation is converted to `` star particles '' upon satisfying the following criteria in any given cell : ( 1 ) converging flow ( @xmath23 ) , ( 2 ) rapid cooling ( @xmath24 ) , and ( 3 ) jeans instability ( @xmath25 ) ( cen et al .",
    "once these conditions are met , a star particle is formed with mass equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the gas mass within the cell , @xmath28 is the current timestep in the simulation , and @xmath29 is the star formation efficiency taken to be 0.07 , except for the l25 run in which @xmath30 is used .",
    "the choice of @xmath29 is made to match two observations : the total stellar density at @xmath31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the reionization epoch at @xmath32 ( e.g. , cen & mcdonald 2002 ) . the value of @xmath33 is determined by the local dynamical time and is equal to the larger of the dynamical time and @xmath34 yr ( cen et al .",
    "2004 ) ; the lower bound of @xmath34 yr is imposed somewhat arbitrarily to reflect a possible minimum star formation timescale in order to smooth out star formation over time , although the results do not sensitively depend on it .",
    "a galaxy within the simulation is simply a group of these star particles .",
    "we discuss the procedure we use for galaxy identification by linking star particles into groups in the next section .",
    "the prediction for the star formation rate is reasonably robust to variations in the adjustable parameter @xmath29 for a given flux of gas cooling into a galaxy .",
    "changes in @xmath29 may change the reservoir in gas being transformed into stars but have little effect on the rate of star formation , which tends to match the infall rate .",
    "the formation of stars and active galactic nuclei ( hereafter , agn ) will generally result in two feedback effects on the gas that can form stars : heating by radiation and mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "the magnitude of these effects in different environments is highly uncertain , and they are parameterized in the simulation by the efficiency parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "stars and agn contribute to a background radiation field ( assumed to be always of uniform intensity throughout the simulated box ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total mass of stellar particles that are formed in the simulation during a given timestep , and @xmath40 is the energy added to the background radiation in the box over the same timestep per unit frequency .",
    "the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spectral energy distributions of a young stellar population and an agn spectrum @xcite , respectively ( normalized so that their integral over frequency is unity ) .",
    "we use the bruzual - charlot population synthesis code ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; bruzual 2000 ) to compute the intrinsic metallicity - dependent uv spectra from stars with salpeter imf ( with a lower and upper mass cutoff of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that @xmath35 is a function of metallicity .",
    "the bruzual - charlot code gives @xmath45 at @xmath46 , and we use an interpolation of these values in the simulation .",
    "we also implement a gas metallicity dependent ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies in the sense that higher metallicity ( hence higher dust content ) galaxies are assumed to allow a lower escape fraction ; we adopt the escape fractions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite for solar and one tenth of solar metallicity , respectively , and interpolate and extrapolate linearly in @xmath49 and in [ fe / h ] .",
    "in addition , we include the emission from agn using the spectral form observationally derived by @xcite , with a radiative efficiency in terms of stellar mass of @xmath50 for @xmath51ev .",
    "the ionizing radiation is released over time by each star particle according to the following function :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the formation time of a stellar particle , and @xmath54 is the dynamical time of the gas in the cell in which the star particle formed .    for the supernovae , a similar prescription is adopted whereby the total supernova energy released by a star particle of mass @xmath39 is @xmath55 in contrast to the radiation energy , however , the supernova mechanical energy and ejected matter are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the stellar particle in question , weighted by the inverse of the gas density in each cell .",
    "the mass released back into the medium by the supernovae is fixed to be @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "the supernova efficiency factor is varied in each of the three simulations with box size of @xmath58 , with values @xmath17 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "if the ejected mass and associated energy propagate into a vacuum , the resulting velocity of the ejecta would be @xmath61 , for the l11-medium simulation with @xmath62 .",
    "this medium value of @xmath37 also corresponds to releasing an energy of @xmath63 ergs ( roughly the energy of one supernova ) for every @xmath64 of stars that are formed .",
    "after the ejecta have accumulated an additional mass comparable to their initial mass , the velocity may slow down to a few hundred @xmath4 .",
    "we assume this velocity would roughly correspond to the observed outflow velocities of lbgs ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "the large simulation with box size of @xmath65 has a supernova energy efficiency of @xmath66 .",
    "the supernova energy is not released instantaneously when a star particle forms , but is released over time with the distribution @xmath67 $ ] , where @xmath53 is the formation time of the star particle and @xmath68yr is a characteristic timescale over which supernova energy is deposited in the igm .",
    "star particles in the l11 simulations are grouped into galaxies using a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "we further require that each galaxy contain at least 20 star particles .",
    "figure [ fig : starparticles ] shows the positions of star particles and the resulting galaxies projected in the x - y plane for each simulation as an illustrative example .",
    "we rank the galaxies in the simulation according to their stellar mass and pick samples above thresholds in stellar mass .",
    "there are 1841 , 2969 , and 5209 galaxies in the l11-low , l11-medium and l11-high simulations respectively corresponding to comoving number densities of 1.38 , 2.2 , and 3.9 @xmath69 .",
    "the galaxy ( stellar ) mass function is shown for each of the simulations in figure [ fig : massfcn ] .",
    "the l11-low simulation has more high mass objects than either the l11-medium or l11-high simulations , and conversely , the l11-high simulation has significantly more low mass objects than either the l11-low or l11-medium simulations .",
    "we expect the supernova energy injection to suppress star formation owing to the heating of the gas , and indeed the total stellar mass in the l11-low simulation is higher than in the simulations with stronger winds ( the stellar mass is dominated by high mass galaxies ) .",
    "it is unclear what process causes an increased abundance of low - mass objects in the l11-high feedback case ; the numerical implementation of the supernova energy injection in the simulations probably tends to break up spatial regions of star formation as more energy is injected .",
    "because of the relatively small box size we use , we do not have many rare objects ( i.e. , objects of low space density , as lbgs are observed to have ) .",
    "we therefore can not consider our galaxy samples for these three simulations as lbg samples explicitly , since the estimated number density of lbgs in a box of this size would require us to do our calculations around only a handful of galaxies which would render our statistics quite poor .",
    "this partly motivates our decision to analyze additionally the larger - box l25 simulation in which we have sufficient volume to reasonably match the observed space density of lbgs .",
    "star particles in this larger simulation are grouped according to the hop group algorithm @xcite with threshold parameters @xmath70 and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for a more detailed description of the galaxy identification method .",
    "we also use modeled b - band luminosities for the galaxies in the simulation , in order to rank them by luminosity in  4 below .",
    "these luminosities are computed by adding the emissivity of all star particles in a galaxy , as determined from the age of the star particle and the instantaneous burst - model isochrone - synthesis code gissel99 ( see @xcite for more details of this procedure ) .      for each of the boxes we analyze ,",
    "we generate a grid of 1200 artificial spectra from the temperature , velocity , and density fields .",
    "we extract 400 such sightlines along each projection of the box .",
    "each spectrum has a number of `` pixels '' , which we set equal to the number of grid cells on a side of the box ( 432 or 768 pixels for the simulations considered here ) .",
    "we compute ly@xmath0  spectra from the temperature , density , and velocity distributions of the gas in the simulation .",
    "the spectra are normalized to a fixed mean transmitted flux equal to the observed value of 0.638 at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we use a photoionization rate of @xmath71 for the l11 boxes and then multiply the resulting optical depths by small factors in order to ensure that the normalization matches the observed value of the mean flux decrement ( 0.36 ) .",
    "we use the recombination coefficient from verner & ferland  ( 1992 ) , and the collisional ionization coefficient from @xcite . note that collisional ionization may be important for distinguishing the effects of winds close to galaxies where the temperature is high .",
    "examples of simulated spectra from the l11-medium simulation are shown in figure  [ fig : losgal ] .",
    "the points superposed on the spectra indicate the redshifts and projected distances ( right axis of the figure ) of galaxies within @xmath72 of the sightline .",
    "the stellar mass of each galaxy is coded by point color .",
    "we see that galaxies lying within @xmath73 are always associated with strong ly@xmath0  absorption .",
    "often , clusters of galaxies are associated with large extended absorption features spanning several hundred @xmath4 .",
    "note that strong absorption features are not always associated with galaxies , but galaxies are always close to some absorption feature .",
    "to see the typical effect of winds on the ly@xmath0  forest spectra , figure  [ fig : los ] shows spectra from a randomly chosen position in the l11 simulations .",
    "the three curves show the same sightline in the l11-low(red ) , l11-medium(green ) and l11-high(blue ) simulations .",
    "the top panel shows the flux as observed in redshift space , and the second panel shows the flux in real space ( i.e. , with gas peculiar velocities set to zero ) .",
    "the third , fourth and fifth panels show the real - space neutral hydrogen density , temperature , and gas overdensity respectively .",
    "the figure shows the well - known correspondence between peaks in the gas density and absorption troughs in the ly@xmath0  forest spectrum .",
    "galaxies in the simulations form in the densest central regions of halos , and so they should clearly be associated with deep absorption troughs up to the transverse distance at which galactic halos are surrounded by dense gas .",
    "we also see in figure  [ fig : los ] that , over most of the spectrum , the three simulations are almost identical , indicating that the effect of winds is very small .",
    "the gas temperature is generally highly correlated with gas density .",
    "however , we can clearly identify one region of the spectrum in which the three simulations are very different and very high temperatures are reached in regions of widely different densities .",
    "this region has obviously been affected by winds .",
    "the gas heated by winds can result in weak , broad ly@xmath0  features , but this effect is hard to identify and to distinguish from the general ly@xmath0  forest arising from colder gas . for example , the ly@xmath0  absorption at @xmath74 in this example becomes broader and weaker with increased wind strength , but it seems difficult to statistically detect these changes on the ly@xmath0  forest because of the low fraction of the spectrum affected by winds .",
    "in fact , as found by @xcite , the effects of galactic winds tend to be degenerate with parameters affecting the typical gas temperature in the igm , which depends on the uncertain history of heating during helium reionization .",
    "the global behavior of the ly@xmath0  forest is more clearly seen in figure  [ fig : wmapsheets ] , which shows 2-dimensional , 1-cell thick slices through the l11-high , l11-medium , and l11-low simulations .",
    "we plot the logarithm of the optical depth as a function of spatial position along the vertical axis , and velocity along the horizontal axis .",
    "hence , each horizontal line in the slice shows a spectrum like that in figure  [ fig : los ] ( the transmitted flux shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : los ] is related to the optical depth as @xmath75 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmapgalsheets ] shows the same slices ( except for a modified color coding for the optical depth ) , together with the spatial positions ( along the vertical axis ) and redshifts ( along the horizontal axis ) of galaxies in the simulation that are located within @xmath76 on either side of the sheets .",
    "galaxies with stellar masses larger than @xmath77 are shown in red .",
    "the connection between galaxies and the ly@xmath0  forest is clearly displayed in figure 6 .",
    "galaxies always lie in regions of high optical depth ( because all galaxies within @xmath76 of the sheet are shown , a small number of them appear to be displaced from high optical depth regions , but they are all at high optical depths when they are plotted on a slice sufficiently close to the galaxy ) .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity of the optical depth slices among the three simulations , despite the very different wind strengths that were assumed .    to understand this result in terms of the physical properties of the igm , we plot the temperature and density of the same sheet in real space for the three simulations in figures  [ fig : wmaptempsheets ] and [ fig : wmaprhosheets ] .",
    "note that the correspondence to the optical depth sheet shown in figures  [ fig : wmapsheets ] and [ fig : wmapgalsheets ] is not exact because the gas peculiar velocities redistribute absorption along the line of sight .",
    "the bubbles produced by galactic winds are very clearly seen in the temperature structure .",
    "similar wind structures have been found in other simulations using the sph technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the size of the hot bubbles clearly increases with the strength of the winds .",
    "however , the winds do not result in the complete removal of high - density gas near the parent galaxies from which they originate .",
    "in fact , figure  [ fig : wmaprhosheets ] shows that the gas density structure is affected only weakly by the winds : comparing the three simulations , we find that the filaments located near the hot bubbles are broken up at a few places on small scales , but apart from this they largely remain in place .",
    "the winds have some effect on the optical depth maps of figures  [ fig : wmapsheets ] and [ fig : wmapgalsheets ] : for example , at the position @xmath78 mpc / h and @xmath79 , there is a region over which ly@xmath0  absorption disappears as the wind strength is increased .",
    "this region corresponds to the large hot bubble seen in figure  [ fig : wmaptempsheets ] near this position , and the filament in figure  [ fig : wmaprhosheets ] that is broken in the high - winds simulation at the same position .",
    "such strong wind effects on the optical depth are , however , relatively rare , and when they occur they tend to redistribute the absorption rather than eliminate it .",
    "most of the time , the hot bubbles expand into low density regions around galaxies , which produce little absorption in any case ( see , for example , the region at @xmath80 mpc / h , @xmath81 mpc / h where a low - density region increases in size with wind strength in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmaprhosheets ] ) .",
    "in other words , the winds follow the path of least resistance .",
    "other gas around galaxies may actually get compressed by the wind bubbles and increase its ly@xmath0  absorption .",
    "voids in the ly@xmath0  spectrum created by the hot expanding bubbles of the winds tend to be filled in by absorption from adjacent gas falling into the galaxy ( owing to varying peculiar velocities ) .",
    "the net result is that the effect of winds on the ly@xmath0  spectra is rather weak and highly variable among different lines of sight .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmapphys ] quantifies the impact of winds on the physical state of the gas in the neighborhood of galaxies .",
    "we show the median value of the temperature , gas overdensity , and neutral hydrogen density in all the simulation pixels whose distance to any identified galaxy is within the value on the horizontal axis .",
    "the temperature increase and neutral density decrease with wind strength is apparent here .",
    "note , however , that even in the simulation with the strongest winds the neutral density continues to rise as a galaxy is approached .",
    "curiously , the total gas density is not much affected by the winds ; if anything it tends to increase slightly with wind strength .",
    "these effects of winds on the physical state of the gas are the direct cause of any changes in the ly@xmath0  forest transmission close to galaxies .",
    "here we quantify the relation between the ly@xmath0  forest flux statistics and the proximity to galaxies in the simulation , and the way this relation varies with wind strength .      in general , one can codify the influence of a galaxy on the ly@xmath0  forest by the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the flux decrement , @xmath82 ( equal to one minus the fraction of transmitted flux ) , conditioned on the presence of a galaxy within a transverse angular separation @xmath83 and velocity separation @xmath84 .",
    "we first study this conditional flux pdf ( cpdf ) for @xmath85 , which was studied previously by @xcite using sph simulations and is described in more detail there .",
    "we obtain the cpdf using all resolved galaxies ( defined as having at least 20 star particle members ) in each simulation . for each galaxy ,",
    "random lines of sight that pass within a maximum impact parameter @xmath83 are chosen , and the flux decrement at the pixel that has the same redshift as the galaxy ( taking into account the galaxy peculiar velocity ) is selected . note that",
    "by choosing lines of sight uniformly distributed within a maximum impact parameter , we are averaging the cpdf over impact parameters with a weighting proportional to @xmath86 , up to the maximum impact parameter shown in each panel .",
    "the cpdf of the flux decrement is shown in figure  [ fig : wmappdfall ] for the four values of @xmath83 ( in arcminutes ) indicated in the top right corner of each panel .",
    "the results are shown for the three l11 simulations with different wind strengths .",
    "the black solid lines show the unconditional pdf computed using all pixels in all spectra .",
    "as the transverse galaxy - sightline distance is reduced , there is a shift in the cpdf from unsaturated ( low d ) pixels to saturated ( high d ) pixels .",
    "the values of the mean decrement ( shown as the top symbols ) and the probability of saturated pixels , defined as @xmath87 ( right symbols ) , which capture some of the information of the full cpdf , also show this clearly .",
    "this result simply reflects the association of galaxies with regions of high optical depth shown earlier in figure 6 and is in good agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the wind effects are seen to be small , as expected from the optical depth sheets discussed in the previous section .",
    "these weak wind effects on the ly@xmath0  forest are in agreement with the work of @xcite and @xcite using a different simulation method with different wind prescriptions .",
    "the result also agrees with that of @xcite and @xcite , who examined simple `` bubble '' wind models .",
    "the small difference has the expected sign : stronger winds should and do reduce the ly@xmath0  absorption in the regions from which they emerge .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comppdf ] , we compare the pdfs for all four of our simulations .",
    "the small difference in the unconditional flux pdfs between the l25 simulation ( dashed black line ) and the three l11 simulations ( solid black lines ) is due to a combination of the effect of differing box size and the slightly different power spectra adopted in the large and small boxes .",
    "simulations of small boxes have an artificially low dispersion in the flux decrement that arises from a low dispersion in gas density distribution , owing to the suppression of large - scale fluctuations .    in summary ,",
    "the unconditional and conditional pdf of the flux decrement are robust predictions of the cdm model , and the effects of galactic winds on them are small .",
    "the conditional pdf can also be examined as a function of galaxy luminosity to see whether more luminous galaxies tend to be associated with stronger ly@xmath0  absorption . in @xcite ,",
    "variations of ly@xmath0  absorption around galaxies were shown to have little dependence on the total star formation rate in each galaxy .",
    "the eulerian simulations we use here have a different prescription for estimating galaxy luminosity ( see  2 ) , and they incorporate the effects of winds , which can affect galaxies of different luminosities in different ways .",
    "we explore the dependence on galaxy luminosity in figure  [ fig : l25pdf ] , which shows the cpdf in the l25 simulation within four different impact parameters and for galaxies with luminosity above four different thresholds .",
    "the four luminosity thresholds ( with luminosities computed as described in  2.2 ) are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , and the total number of galaxies in the @xmath65 box of the simulation above each luminosity threshold is labeled for each curve .",
    "for reference , the space density of the observed lbgs would correspond to our highest luminosity threshold , with only @xmath92 galaxies in the simulation .",
    "the figure shows there is a weak dependence of the galaxy - ly@xmath0  transmission correlation on galaxy luminosity .",
    "the sign of the effect is as expected if galaxy luminosity correlates with mass and large - scale environment  the ly@xmath0  forest around more luminous galaxies shows a preference for high decrement pixels .",
    "this dependence on galaxy luminosity is , of course , sensitive to the relation between observed galaxies and galaxies in the simulation , which is affected by our poor understanding of the factors that determine star formation rates in galaxies . at the smallest angular separations",
    ", the dependence of the galaxy - ly@xmath0  transmission correlation can not be clearly distinguished from the random noise on the curves caused by the small number of galaxy - sightline pairs at these separations in our box .",
    "it is clear , however , that in all cases the ly@xmath0  absorption increases as a galaxy is approached .",
    "the preceding figures show only the cpdf of the flux decrement at the same velocity as a galaxy within a certain impact parameter .",
    "however , we expect the galaxy - intergalactic medium connection to persist over some velocity range from the true redshift of the galaxy .",
    "one can choose to examine pixels within a fixed velocity interval from the galaxy redshift as a further test of the predictions .",
    "we now examine the flux distribution as a function of velocity offset .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wmappflux ] we show the median , first quartile and 10 percentile values of the transmitted flux , f , for ly@xmath0  forest spectral pixels in lines of sight within annuli of angular separation from a galaxy in the range @xmath93 , and within a velocity interval @xmath94 .",
    "the 100 most massive galaxies in the simulation have been used for this calculation .",
    "hence , the ( top , middle , bottom ) curve in each panel gives the value of the transmitted flux for which the probability to measure a larger flux is @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , respectively , over the indicated range of @xmath83 and at any pixel in the spectrum within @xmath94 .",
    "the six panels are for six different ranges of @xmath83 , as shown .",
    "the red , green and blue curves correspond to the l11-low , l11-medium and l11-high simulations , respectively . in the limit of large @xmath84",
    ", the curves generally approach the unconditional percentile values .",
    "the decrease of @xmath98 at small @xmath99 shows that it becomes increasingly unlikely to observe large transmitted fluxes as one probes pixels closer to the galaxy redshift .",
    "we note from figure  [ fig : wmappflux ] that the effects of winds are most important within an impact parameter @xmath100 and that they are small at larger separations .",
    "we also point out that the probability of observing a transmitted flux value as high as @xmath101 near a galaxy decreases rapidly only at @xmath102 , and that at larger velocity separations this probability is not much affected by the presence of winds ( see top left panel ) . in other words , close to the galaxy s systemic velocity ,",
    "the probability of finding a transparent line of sight is low but is significantly increased by winds , while at large offsets from the galaxy redshift the probability is higher but is no longer sensitive to winds .",
    "the median transmitted flux , typically with a lower value @xmath103 to @xmath104 , is more strongly affected by winds up to velocity separations @xmath105 . as seen in figure  [ fig : wmappflux ]",
    ", the effects of winds should be detectable in the ly@xmath0  forest near galaxies once the median transmitted flux is measured to an accuracy better than @xmath106 .",
    "the results obtained from the l11 simulations are , however , strongly affected by the size of the simulation box , and better theoretical predictions from larger boxes will be needed in order to infer wind strengths from the transmitted flux distribution as a function of @xmath84 and @xmath107 .",
    "the total velocity across the box in the l11 simulations is only @xmath108 , so the velocity interval @xmath109 shown in figure  [ fig : wmappflux ] is nearly half of the box size .",
    "the curves in this figure are strongly affected by the box size : they increase too fast with @xmath84 due to the suppression of large - scale power .",
    "any box - size effects should be smaller in the l25 simulation .",
    "the same curves for this simulation , computed for the set of the 100 most luminous galaxies , are shown in figure  [ fig : pfluxl25 ] .",
    "these curves are more reliable predictions for a direct comparison to observations than those in figure  [ fig : wmappflux ] .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have simulations for different wind strengths in larger boxes .",
    "however we expect that the differences introduced by winds would be similar to those in the l11 simulations .",
    "the correlation of lbgs and the ly@xmath0  forest has been studied observationally by @xcite , who measured the mean flux decrement ( @xmath110 , where @xmath98 is the transmitted flux , which was shown in figs .  [ fig : wmappflux ] and [ fig : pfluxl25 ] ) as a function of total redshift - space comoving separation from a galaxy , @xmath111 .",
    "this is defined in terms of the angular and velocity separations as @xmath112 ^ 2 + \\left [ ( 1+z ) \\delta",
    "v / h(z ) \\right]^2 ~ , \\label{eq : delta}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the angular diameter distance and the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath115 .",
    "the @xcite observations are reproduced in figure  [ fig : adelcomp ] , together with our predictions for the same quantity using the l25 simulation .",
    "we use four different galaxy luminosity thresholds , such that the total number of galaxies in the simulation above the threshold is 1000 , 100 , 40 and 20 .",
    "as previously found by several authors , the results of @xcite do not agree with theoretical expectations .",
    "the observations show the flux decrement at a constant value for @xmath116 , which then drops sharply at @xmath117 .",
    "the predictions show that the flux decrement should continually increase as a galaxy is approached .",
    "the effects of winds in our simulations do not alter the clear increase of the flux decrement , relative to its mean value , as @xmath111 decreases from @xmath118 to @xmath12 , and they may produce at most a @xmath106 decline of the flux decrement when @xmath117 for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "however , this small decline , seen in the innermost point in figure  [ fig : adelcomp ] for the most luminous galaxy class , may be affected by noise due to the small number of galaxy - quasar pairs at this small separation in the simulation .",
    "the observational points at small @xmath111 in figure  [ fig : adelcomp ] challenge the cdm - based picture of the lyman - alpha forest that has emerged over the last decade .",
    "this picture predicts that the average flux decrement near galaxies should increase , not decrease .",
    "the galactic winds predicted by our simulations reduce the strength of this trend but do not reverse it , in agreement with other studies @xcite .",
    "we now ask whether the discrepancy seen in figure  [ fig : adelcomp ] could be explained by galaxy redshift errors , misestimation of the continuum , or simply by small number statistics .",
    "we focus on the innermost point , based on three quasar - galaxy pairs with separations of @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , for which @xcite find a mean flux decrement of 0.11 .",
    "we calculate the probability of obtaining this measured value , given the model of the l25 simulation we have analyzed in previous sections .",
    "redshifts of faint lbgs are notoriously difficult to obtain because the gas being expelled in a wind at small radius can displace the redshift of emission or absorption lines relative to the systemic galaxy redshift . after correcting for this effect ,",
    "@xcite estimated their galaxy redshift errors were @xmath122 @xmath123 ( according to a calibration of the redshift error that @xcite measured from an independent sample of 27 lyman break galaxies with well measured nebular emission line redshifts ) , but could be larger for some galaxies when line equivalent widths are not measured , or in some pathological cases where galaxy wind effects are apparently stronger .",
    "previous analyses @xcite found that errors in the galaxy redshifts drawn from a gaussian with dispersion @xmath124 substantially reduce the predicted transmitted flux close to galaxies , but are insufficient to explain the very low mean flux decrement ( @xmath125 ) that @xcite measured at the smallest value of @xmath111 ( see fig .  [ fig : adelcomp ] ) . to estimate this effect within the context of the present simulations , we calculate the cumulative distribution of predicted decrements , @xmath82 , averaged over velocity widths @xmath126 , assuming various different velocity errors , @xmath127 . that is , in our simulation , we make our average decrement measurement over a velocity range @xmath128 , centered at a redshift displaced from the true redshift of the galaxy by a random amount drawn from a gaussian of dispersion @xmath127 . here",
    "we use the l25 simulation because of its larger volume .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluke ] shows our results for several choices of the averaging interval @xmath84 .",
    "@xcite binned their data by @xmath129 , for the quasars ssa22d13 , q1422 + 2309b and q0201 + 1120 respectively .",
    "these values are bracketed by the top and second rows of panels .",
    "right hand panels show the cumulative probability distributions for a single galaxy - quasar pair , while left hand panels show the distributions for the mean decrement averaged over three galaxy - quasar pairs selected at random from our full sample .",
    "note that while we average over velocity bins of fixed width , @xcite average over a variable width that depends on impact parameter .",
    "however , since the range of their velocity width is small and bracketed by the upper and middle panels in our figure  [ fig : fluke ] that are essentially identical , this difference has no practical impact .",
    "while redshift errors substantially increase the probability of low decrements , even for @xmath130 the probability of a single galaxy - quasar pair having decrement @xmath131 is only @xmath132 for an averaging interval @xmath133 ( middle right panel ) , and the probability of the mean decrement of three such pairs being below 0.11 is @xmath134 .",
    "we note that for at least one of the three galaxies , the redshift error has been confirmed to be less than @xmath135 ( k. adelberger , private communication ) .",
    "these probabilities are higher than obtained in windless simulations @xcite , indicating that winds affect the flux distribution , but not enough to make the observations likely .",
    "in addition to an observational redshift error , there may also be an intrinsic redshift error arising from the fact that real galaxies may have an intrinsic velocity dispersion relative to the surrounding gas at the observed impact parameters that is not fully included in our simulations .",
    "the resulting intrinsic redshift error needs to be added in quadrature to the observational one . in galaxy groups ,",
    "the group velocity dispersion has the same effect as a redshift error .",
    "the simulations we use have limited spatial resolution , implying that the high - density central parts of halos are not well resolved , and the orbits of satellite galaxies and their tidal disruption are not adequately followed .",
    "this results in an artificial increase of the merger rate of galaxies in groups , which can reduce the velocity dispersion of simulated galaxies compared to real galaxies .",
    "the magnitude of this theoretical redshift error actually depends on the nature of the lyman break galaxies .",
    "if these are often satellite galaxies undergoing intense starbursts after a group merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they may be moving close to the escape velocity of the galaxy group halo and have large peculiar velocities relative to the surrounding gas .",
    "if they are more often associated with central halo galaxies , the peculiar velocities may be lower . for a singular isothermal halo with velocity dispersion @xmath6 and outer radius @xmath136 ,",
    "the escape velocity at radius @xmath137 is @xmath138 for a typical galaxy group halo at @xmath139 with @xmath140 , the escape velocity may easily be as large as @xmath141 , which after projection may give a velocity dispersion comparable in magnitude to the observational errors .",
    "in other words , the total redshift error may be substantially increased relative to the observational redshift error .",
    "even f we assume , however , total redshift errors of @xmath141 ( which we view as unrealistically large ) , the joint probability for three quasar - galaxy sightlines is only @xmath142 . alternatively",
    ", the high stellar masses estimated for lbgs @xcite suggest that they are most likely the central galaxies of their parent halos , in which case their peculiar velocities relative to the halo center - of - mass are likely to be small and the intrinsic redshift errors , also small .",
    "observations of the clustering of lbgs in redshift space and the pairwise velocity dispersion of lbgs as a function of angular separation should reflect the intrinsic dispersion of galaxy redshifts from the redshift of the surrounding gaseous halos distinguishing between the two possible scenarios ( central vs. satellite galaxies ) and constraining our estimates of the size of this effect .",
    "continuum fitting errors could affect the observational estimates of the mean decrement . at the redshift of the @xcite observations , the minimum flux decrement over intervals of @xmath143 , comparable to the intervals used for continuum fitting , is usually no more than @xmath144 , so it is unlikely that the continuum fitting error is larger than that .",
    "spectral noise can also affect the probability of measuring the low flux decrement of @xcite .",
    "the noise in their spectrum over an interval @xmath145 is only @xmath146 .",
    "the true flux decrement in the first data point of figure  [ fig : adelcomp ] may be as high as @xmath147 , owing to the combination of continuum fitting errors and spectral noise .",
    "the probability to measure this value of the flux decrement for three galaxies , and for a total redshift error of @xmath130 would still be @xmath144 , from our figure  [ fig : fluke ] .",
    "an alternative test that can be done to compare the model predictions with present and future data is to average the flux decrement over a larger interval @xmath84 .",
    "this has the advantage of reducing the sample variance of the measured flux decrement , and the disadvantage of eliminating information from flux fluctuations on scales smaller than @xmath84 . in particular",
    ", if the galaxy redshift error is @xmath148 , then it makes sense to consider the average flux over @xmath149 interval because the spectral points over this interval are similarly likely to be at the true galaxy redshift .",
    "we have estimated by eye from figure 10 of @xcite that the flux decrement of the same three galaxies when averaged over @xmath149 around the galaxy redshift is @xmath150 .",
    "figure 16 shows that the probability of this flux is only @xmath144 indicating that this larger - scale feature is also not easily explained by our simulated spectra .    in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we find that the small number of galaxies in the observed sample do not _ easily _ explain the discrepancy between the simulation predictions and the @xcite data , even if we consider the dominant contributions of galactic winds and redshift errors . fortunately , the size of these kinds of data sets is bound to increase over the next few years , and comparison of larger data sets to predictions of the type presented here should definitively show whether there is or is not a contradiction between the models and the observations .",
    "we have analyzed the ly@xmath0  forest in the neighborhood of galaxies using cosmological simulations of structure formation that include galactic winds .",
    "we find that winds can greatly affect the temperature structure of intergalactic gas that is relatively close to galaxies , but that the density structure is less affected .",
    "changes in the structure of the optical depth giving rise to the ly@xmath0  forest are smaller still than in the density field because of the tendency of peculiar velocities to smear out the changes in regions affected by winds .",
    "these results are broadly in accordance with previous studies that used sph simulations with a variety of prescriptions for modeling the effects of galactic winds @xcite , as well as with more simplified models @xcite .",
    "analysis of simulations with realistic wind prescriptions is particularly interesting in light of recent observations of the galaxy - ly@xmath0  forest connection at @xmath1 @xcite and the apparent detection of a `` galaxy proximity effect '' .",
    "while more data are clearly needed in order to ensure that the result is not due to the small number of galaxy - qso pairs observed so far , we find that our simulations are not successful in reproducing the magnitude of the proximity effect observed , except as a rare statistical fluctuation .",
    "intrinsic galaxy velocity dispersions , caused by the motion of the galaxies within the gaseous halos around them , may increase the effective galaxy redshift error .",
    "this effect is highly uncertain from a theoretical perspective , because it depends on the type of halos in which lbgs form ( in particular , whether lbgs tend to be massive galaxies in halo centers , or faster - moving satellite galaxies ) , but may make the current observations more likely .",
    "the ly@xmath0  flux decrement is generally predicted to increase near galaxies owing to the high gas density in regions that have gravitationally collapsed .",
    "winds have the effect of diminishing the magnitude of this increase .",
    "this effect of winds , although small , is in principle detectable , in particular by complementing ly@xmath0  measurements with metal - line observations that could be sensitive to the gas temperature , although we have not investigated the effect on metal - lines in this paper . to detect the effect of winds in reducing the ly@xmath0  absorption near galaxies , accurate theoretical predictions",
    "are required for the expected ly@xmath0  flux decrement distribution as a function of velocity and angular separation from a galaxy , for different wind strengths .",
    "we have presented these predictions here , although with the caveat that the predictions may depend on the uncertain correspondence of observed lyman break galaxies and the galaxies in the simulations we analyze .",
    "a large number of galaxies with high signal - to - noise quasar spectra ( similar to those used in the @xcite study ) from nearby sightlines are essential to search for the effects of winds . as shown in our figures [ fig : wmappflux ] and [ fig : pfluxl25 ] , large redshift errors and averaging the flux over large intervals in velocity will seriously affect the measurement of the effect of winds on the galaxy - ly@xmath0  absorption correlation , since the signature of winds is strongest close to the galaxies systemic velocities .",
    "accurate determination of the clustering properties of lbgs ( or other high - redshift galaxy samples in which the selection function is well understood ) in redshift space should allow us to correct for the effect of intrinsic galaxy redshift errors on the observed galaxy - ly@xmath0  correlation for future comparisons . with precise redshifts and high - resolution spectra ,",
    "the effect of winds at small separations is detectable .",
    "ongoing observations will provide a large increase in the sample of galaxies used to determine the mean ly@xmath0  transmitted flux near lbgs ( adelberger et al .  , 2005 ) .",
    "these observations will result in a dramatic improvement in our assessment of the effects of winds on the ly@xmath0  forest observed near galaxies .",
