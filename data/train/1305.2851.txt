    "since randers metrics arise from riemannian metrics and vector fields ( or 1-forms ) , working on them are simpler than finsler metrics in general case .",
    "because of the construction of randers metrics , it seems that many properties obtained in riemannian case can be extended to this case with some conditions .",
    "+ an attractive class of structures in differential geometry is the family of invariant structures on lie groups with respect to the action of lie groups on themselves .",
    "invariant riemannian metrics on lie groups belong to this family .",
    "these metrics have been studied by many mathematicians because the algebraic properties of a lie group can impress on the geometric properties of it .",

    "recently , many studies have been accomplished to extend these properties to finsler spaces . on the other hand",
    "the algebraic structure of lie groups can help us to find simple formulas for some complicated quantities related to finsler spaces such as flag curvature ( for example see @xcite . ) .",
    "+ in this article we study the intersection between automorphism and isometry groups of some randers spaces .",

    "let @xmath0 be a simply connected lie group with lie algebra @xmath1",

    "also we have @xmath4 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath5 if and only if @xmath6 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath7 . +",
    "a finsler metric on a manifold @xmath8 is a non - negative function @xmath9 with the following properties :    1 .",

    "we say that a metric ( finsler or riemann ) on @xmath8 is absolutely left ( right ) invariant if @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the isometry group of @xmath8 with respect to the metric .",
