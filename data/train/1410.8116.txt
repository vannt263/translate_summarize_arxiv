    "we assume that ( [ eq1 ] ) is true for any region with @xmath63 , for some @xmath64 , then we need to show that it is also true for any region @xmath26 with @xmath65 .",

    "now we consider the region @xmath6 obtained from @xmath26 by recovering the unit triangle at the position @xmath87 on the base .",
    "we now apply kuo s theorem [ kuothm ] to the dual graph @xmath43 of @xmath6 , where the unit triangles corresponding to the four vertices @xmath48 are chosen as in figure [ kuoqar4 ] ( see the shaded triangles ) . in particular , the triangles corresponding to @xmath88 and @xmath89 are at the positions @xmath87 and @xmath90 on the base ; and the ones corresponding to @xmath91 are on the upper - right corner of the region .",
    ".,width=377 ]    one readily sees that the six regions that have dual graphs appearing in the equation ( [ kuoeq ] ) of kuo s theorem have some lozenges , which are forced into any tilings .",
    "luckily , by removing such forced lozenges , we still get new regions of @xmath17-type . in particular , after removing forced lozenges from the region corresponding to @xmath92 , we get the region @xmath93 ( see the region restricted by bold contour in figure [ kuoqar9](a ) ) .",

    "first , we want to simplify the first ratio in the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eqfinal ] ) .",
    "we re - write it as @xmath110 the ratio @xmath111 has its numerator and denominator almost the same , except for some terms involving @xmath87 or @xmath90 .",
    "canceling out all common terms of the numerator and the denominator , we have @xmath112 similarly , we get @xmath113 and @xmath114 thus , we obtain @xmath115 by the same trick , we can simply the first ratio in the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eqfinal ] ) as @xmath116    next , we simply the second ratio in each term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq1a ] ) . by replacing the operator @xmath67 by the operator @xmath68 , the whole simplifying - process works in the same way with each term @xmath117 replaced by @xmath118 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath119 and @xmath120 finally , by ( [ eqsimple1])([eqsimple4 ] ) , we can simplify the equation ( [ eqfinal ] ) to @xmath121 which is obviously true with @xmath122 .",
    "this means that ( [ eqfinal ] ) holds , and so does ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
