    "transport properties of low - dimensional systems have been subject of intensive research work over the last two decades .",
    "one of the fundamental discoveries that has driven the field was the observation of conductance quantization in ballistic quantum wires and quantum point contacts .  @xcite it was found that conductance exhibits a staircase - like dependence on the electron density with the universal step .",
    "the understanding of this phenomenon follows already from the single - electron picture , which predicts for the conductance of a one - dimensional single channel - clean wire ,  @xcite @xmath0 the physical origin of conductance plateaus at certain gate voltages was associated with a fixed number of occupied electronic subbands , each supplying one quantum of conductance @xmath1 . within the same approach of noninteracting particles both charge and energy",
    "are carried by electronic excitations .",
    "this results in the universal relation between electric and thermal conductances , known as the wiedemann - franz law @xmath2 .",
    "the thermal conductance of noninteracting electrons is thus @xmath3 in addition to @xmath4 and @xmath5 two thermoelectric coefficients of the electron gas are usually of great interest",
    ". these are thermopower @xmath6 , which relates an induced voltage drop across the wire to applied temperature gradient , and peltier coefficient @xmath7 connecting electric and heat currents .",
    "these two coefficients are connected by an onsager relation @xmath8 . in the absence of interactions",
    "the thermopower and peltier coefficients are exponentially small @xmath9 at low temperatures @xmath10 .",
    "( here @xmath11 is the chemical potential . )",
    "the reason for such strong suppression of thermopower and peltier coefficients is the partial cancellation between heat currents carried by particles with energies @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "only the absence of electronic states below the bottom of the band prevents @xmath7 and @xmath6 from vanishing exactly .",
    "the remarkable success of the simple single - electron picture in describing the quantization of conductance and explaining the temperature dependence of thermoelectric coefficients is attributed to the fact that quantum wires are always connected to two - dimensional leads , where interactions between electrons do not play a significant role . even though the interactions in the wire are usually not weak , i.e. , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fermi velocity , it has been shown within the so - called luttinger - liquid model of one - dimensional electrons that the interactions inside the wire do not affect conductance quantization .",
    "@xcite it is no surprise then that a number of recent experiments ,  @xcite that revealed deviations from the perfect quantization , , in low - density wires , attracted a great deal of theoretical attention .",
    "@xcite these deviations often take the form of a shoulder - like feature , which develops at finite temperature just below the first quantized plateau , around @xmath16 . at present",
    "there is no consensus on the theoretical interpretation of this phenomenon .",
    "however , it is generally accepted that electron - electron interaction effects should be involved in explaining these experimental observations .    in a number of recent publications  @xcite transport properties of one - dimensional conductors",
    "were reconsidered focusing on the physics which lies beyond an ideal luttinger - liquid model . in particular , when studying the temperature dependence of the corresponding kinetic coefficients refs",
    ".   emphasized one fundamental aspect of interactions , namely the role of physical processes that lead to equilibration of electrons inside the wire .",
    "it should be emphasized that equilibration is absent in an ideal luttinger liquid since bosonic elementary excitations of the latter have infinite lifetime , thus there is no relaxation towards equilibrium in these systems , no matter how strong the interactions are . in higher - dimensional systems equilibration at low temperatures is primarily provided by pair collisions of electrons .",
    "these , however , do not provide relaxation in one - dimensional systems .",
    "this is due to the conservation laws for momentum and energy which severely restrict the phase space available for scattering . as a result",
    ", pair collisions in ideal one - dimensional wires can occur with a zero momentum change or an interchange of the two momenta , leaving the distribution function unaffected .",
    "the leading equilibration mechanism thus involves collisions of more than two particles . for a weakly interacting system , it is then natural to assume that equilibration is provided by three - particle scattering processes .",
    "@xcite this , of course , also relies on the additional assumption that other degrees of freedom , which can absorb energy and momentum from electrons ( phonons , for example ) can be ignored .",
    "this assumption is acceptable in many cases since electron - phonon coupling constant is typically much smaller than that due to the electron - electron interactions .    in practice ,",
    "long one - dimensional structures are strongly prone to inhomogeneities inevitably present due to the nearby gates or charged dopants underlying the wire . however , most preceding works studied effect of equilibration on transport assuming uniform ( clean ) wires .",
    "the notable exceptions include refs .   and where smooth inhomogeneities were accounted for while assuming full equilibration of the electronic system .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study effects of inhomogeneities on transport properties of partially equilibrated quantum wires .",
    "we focus our attention to the situation where the scale of inhomogeneities @xmath17 is much larger than the electron fermi wavelength , @xmath18 , such that backscattering of electrons from the inhomogeneities is negligible . in this case",
    "only interactions ( three - particle collisions ) may interrupt direct flow of the electron liquid and convert ( backscatter ) some right - moving electrons into left - moving ones .",
    "since non - uniform systems are no longer translationally invariant , there is an additional scattering mechanism , which can relax electron momentum without changing the number of right- and left - moving particles .",
    "@xcite we find that equilibration due to three - particle collisions and inhomogeneity - induced momentum - nonconserving scattering compete with each other .",
    "an interplay between these two effects leads to a very interesting picture of the electronic transport and results in temperature - dependent corrections to the wire resistance and thermoelectric coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - unifromwire ] we discuss the general structure of the electron distribution function and transport in a clean one - dimensional wire .",
    "we briefly mention the resulting transport coefficients for this case , which were recently reported in ref .  .",
    "in sec .  [ sec - formalism ] we develop a general formalism which enables us to treat equilibration of the electron system due to three - particle collisions and inhomogeneity - induced scattering on equal footing .",
    "the central part of our work is sec .",
    "[ sec - transport ] where we apply this theory to the calculation of transport coefficients in one - dimensional inhomogeneous wires . from our general expressions",
    "we recover the results known for the short and long uniform wires , and also consider several experimentally relevant simple models of inhomogeneous case .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec - discussions ] .",
    "supplementary appendices accompany some technical aspects of our calculations .",
    "in the absence of interactions , left- and right - moving electrons inside the wire are at equilibrium with the reservoir they originated from .",
    "if a voltage bias @xmath19 and/or temperature difference @xmath20 is applied between the reservoirs , then corresponding equilibria differ from each other , giving rise to a particular form of the nonequilibrium distribution function inside the wire .",
    "this distribution depends on the direction of motion of electrons and for the right- and left - moving particles is controlled , respectively , by the left and right lead , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the energy of an electron with momentum @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the unit step function .",
    "the difference between the chemical potentials ( temperatures ) in the leads is equal to the voltage ( temperature difference ) applied to the wire @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . using the distribution function at @xmath27",
    "one can find electric current @xmath28 with the conductance of noninteracting electrons @xmath29 , thus recovering , eq .",
    ", up to an exponentially small correction . the same distribution , eq .  , provides thermal conductance , eq .  , and thermoelectric coefficients @xmath30 , consistent with eq .  .",
    "in the presence of interactions ballistic propagation of electrons through the wire may be interrupted by collisions with other electrons . as a result of these collisions ,",
    "some electrons change their direction of motion thus losing memory of the lead they originated from .",
    "such backscattering processes modify the electron distribution function which is then no longer given by eq .  .",
    "it is important to realize that the effect of electron collisions on the distribution function depends strongly on the length of the wire .",
    "indeed , electrons traverse short wires relatively fast , such that interactions do not have time to change distribution , eq .  , considerably . on the other hand , in the limit of very long wire one should expect full equilibration of left- and right - moving electrons into a single distribution , even in the case of weak interactions .    for the galilean invariant system one can easily infer the electron distribution function in a fully equilibrated state .",
    "indeed , viewed from a reference frame moving with the drift velocity @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the electric current and @xmath33 is the electron density ) the electron system is at rest and must be described by the equilibrium fermi distribution . performing a galilean transformation back into the stationary frame of reference this distribution takes the form , @xmath34 where the chemical potential @xmath35 and temperature @xmath36 inside the equilibrated wire are , in general , different from @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    at zero temperature , @xmath39 , the distributions , eqs .   and ,",
    "coincide , provided @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the fermi momentum of the system . at non - zero temperature the distribution function , eq .",
    ", of electrons inside the equilibrated wire is slightly different from the distribution , eq .  , supplied by the leads . the mismatch between the two distribution functions results in additional resistance , reducing the conductance of noninteracting electrons to  @xcite @xmath42\\,.\\ ]",
    "] this result is universal since it was obtained without making any specific assumptions regarding the process of equilibration .",
    "the corresponding derivation relied uniquely on the analysis of conservation laws for energy , momentum , and particle number .",
    "it is applicable as long as wire length @xmath43 exceeds certain equilibration length @xmath44 such that the distribution , eq .",
    ", is already established . the exact definition of @xmath44 is model specific and depends on the interaction between electrons .",
    "quite generically , however , it can be argued that this length is exponentially large at low temperature @xmath45 .",
    "the exponential scale can be understood from the mechanism of equilibration  @xcite which is also discussed later in the text .",
    "the thermal conductance of fully equilibrated wire is zero @xmath46 this result can be understood simply from the structure of the distribution function .",
    "one should recall that thermal conductance is defined under the condition that electric current @xmath47 vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath48 and the distribution , eq .  , takes the form of the standard fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "due to its symmetry @xmath49 the heat current carried by electrons vanishes , regardless of the temperature bias @xmath20 applied to the wire .",
    "one therefore finds that in an infinitely long wire the thermal conductance is zero . one should note , however , that thermal conductivity is finite,@xcite i.e. , at @xmath50 the thermal conductance scales as @xmath51 .    unlike the electric and thermal conductances , thermopower and peltier coefficients",
    "are significantly enhanced by equilibration effects .",
    "specifically , @xmath7 grows from the exponentially small value , eq .",
    ", for short wires @xmath52 to @xmath53 in fully equilibrated ( long ) wires , @xmath54 .",
    "a more careful treatment of the equilibration effects is required in wires of intermediate length @xmath55 , where the electron distribution function is only partially equilibrated .",
    "@xcite as we already mentioned , in the case of weakly interacting electrons the leading mechanism of equilibration is provided by three - particle collisions . at low temperatures",
    "one should consider two types of such collisions .",
    "the strongest scattering events involve three particles near the fermi level ( for example , one left mover that scatters off two right movers such that all particles preserve their direction of motion ) .",
    "these collisions are relatively fast , and the corresponding scattering length @xmath56 scales as a power law of temperature .",
    "however , these collisions alone can not establish the distribution since they conserve the number of right- and left - moving particles .",
    "the other important three - particle collisions involve backscattering of , say , a right - moving electron into a left - moving one .",
    "this backscattering occurs near the bottom of the band and provides equilibration between the chemical potentials of right and left movers , thus establishing the distribution , eq .  .",
    "since at low temperatures the probability to find an empty state at the band bottom is exponentially small , the corresponding relaxation process is very slow , and equilibration length is large , @xmath45 .",
    "let us consider now a segment of the wire , whose length @xmath57 is small compared to the equilibration length @xmath44 but large as compared to @xmath56 , namely , @xmath58 .",
    "this condition implies that typical electron with energy near the fermi level passes through the segment without backscattering so that the distribution , eq .",
    ", can not be established .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath57 is already sufficiently large for electrons to experience other multiple collisions which allow momentum and energy exchange between right- and left - moving electrons . under these conditions ,",
    "the electron distribution function in the segment achieves a state of partial equilibration , in which the numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the right- and left - moving electrons are conserved independently .",
    "the form of this distribution can be obtained from the general statistical mechanics argument by maximizing the entropy of electrons while preserving @xmath61 , total energy and momentum of the system ,  @xcite @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the effective temperature , parameter @xmath64 has dimension of velocity and accounts for the conservation of momentum in electron collisions , and @xmath65 are the chemical potentials of the left- and right - moving particles .",
    "the distribution , eq .  ,",
    "smoothly interpolates between the regimes of no equilibration , eq .  , and that of full equilibration , eq .  . in the absence of temperature difference ,",
    "@xmath66 , the unperturbed distribution , eq .  , is obtained from eq .   by setting @xmath67 and identifying the chemical potentials with those in the leads : @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "[ here and throughout the paper we use @xmath70 to denote left ( right ) lead while @xmath71 denote left ( right ) movers . ] the fully equilibrated distribution , eq .",

    "the electric current is expressed as @xmath73 , which identifies parameter @xmath64 as the drift velocity @xmath74 .",
    "we should emphasize here that since the distribution , eq .",

    "the implications of the distribution , eq .  , for the transport coefficients of partially equilibrated clean wires were discussed in ref .  .",
    "in the following we generalize the above picture of electronic transport in one - dimensional wires accounting for possible non - uniformities of the system .",
    "inhomogeneous quantum wire connected adiabatically to two - dimensional leads and biased by the small voltage @xmath25 and/or temperature difference @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the spatial scale @xmath17 of the inhomogeneities is large compared to the fermi wavelength , and thus electrons do not experience backscattering from inhomogeneities .",

    "if the spatial variations related to inhomogeneities occur on a length scale @xmath17 much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath79 , electrons do not suffer any backscattering .",

    "to elucidate further the origin of the frustration it is important to emphasize that momentum - nonconserving scattering resists full equilibration of electrons into a single distribution , eq .  .",
    "these scattering processes reduce velocity @xmath64 and thus prevent complete relaxation of the difference in chemical potentials @xmath221 . indeed , since the current @xmath32 is fixed by the external circuit then according to eq .",
    "decrease in @xmath64 implies increase in @xmath221 .",
    "this effect is opposite to that of the equilibration processes due to three - particle collisions which tend to relax @xmath221 .",
    "second , the correction to resistance of a nonuniform wire was obtained in studies  @xcite by calculating the rate of momentum change @xmath222 for right - moving electrons .",
    "note , however , that in an inhomogeneous system without translational invariance momentum is not a good quantum number .",
    "indeed , the momentum change of right movers due to collisions depends on position and thus , is not the same for electrons inside the wire , where it was calculated ,  @xcite than that ( actual change ) in the leads .",
    "our present scheme is free from this difficulty . as we show in the next section it is really the rate @xmath78 , computed from the well - defined energy exchange , that is needed to determine the wire resistance and other transport coefficients .",
    "we are set now for the calculation of transport coefficients in an inhomogeneous wire . indeed , our basic eqs .",
    "and provide electric @xmath32 and heat @xmath147 currents as the response to the applied bias @xmath19 and temperature difference @xmath20 .",

    "the lack of complete electronic equilibration in the inhomogeneous quantum wires , which is another central observation of our work , warrants additional discussion .",

    "three - particle collisions constitute the leading - order relaxation process . although the corresponding relaxation rate is slow ( or equivalently relaxation length is large ) due to the required scattering through the bottom of the band , complete equilibration between the right and left movers is nevertheless possible in a _ homogeneous _ wire .",

    "interestingly , lack of full equilibration is a more general characteristic of inhomogeneous quantum wires , which is a consequence of conservation laws .",
    "more precisely , in inhomogeneous wires it is generally not possible to reconcile full equilibration with conservation of energy . technically speaking",
