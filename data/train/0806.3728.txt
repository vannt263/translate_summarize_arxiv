    "there has been interest recently in constructing ricci - flat khler metrics on resolutions @xmath12 of the singularity of @xmath1 .",
    "one source of interest in these asymptotically conical calabi - yau manifolds is in the ads / cft correspondence ( cf .",
    "another motivation is in the construction of new calabi - yau manifolds by resolving conical singularities of a singular calabi - yau space ( cf  @xcite ) .",
    "the resolution will necessarily be crepant , and one requires that the metric on @xmath13 be asymptotic to the original ricci - flat khler cone metric on @xmath1 . in this article",
    "we will give a partial solution to the existence of such metrics .",
    "many examples are already known . in particular , when @xmath19 , for @xmath8 a finite group acting freely on @xmath20 , such a metric on a resolution of @xmath1 will be an ale ricci - flat khler metric .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of ale ricci - flat khler metrics , in each khler class , on @xmath1 has been proved by p. kronheimer  @xcite for @xmath21 and by d. joyce  @xcite for @xmath22 .    until recently all known examples of sasaki - einstein manifolds were quasi - regular , meaning they are orbifold fibrations over khler einstein orbifolds .",
    "the 5-dimensional sasaki - einstein manifolds @xmath23 of j. gauntlett , d. martelli , j. sparks , and d. waldram  @xcite provided the first irregular examples , meaning that they are not simply orbifold fibrations over a khler - einstein orbifold . the general existence problem for sasaki - einstein metrics on toric sasaki manifolds has been solved in general in the beautiful paper of a. futaki , h. ono , g. wang  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "their result implies that any toric @xmath24-gorenstein isolated singularity @xmath1 admits a ricci - flat khler cone metric .",
    "this will be used as a source of examples in this article .",
    "although a crepant resolution does not always exist , it is elementary to construct examples using toric geometry .",

    "yau  @xcite constructed metrics asymptotic , in some sense , to a cone over a regular , or quasi - regular , sasaki - einstein manifold .",
    "the present work differs in that the existence of complete ricci - flat metrics are proved which are asymptotic to cones over irregular sasaki - einstein manifolds .",
    "some explicit examples of ricci - flat khler metrics asymptotic to cones over irregular sasaki - einstein manifolds were constructed in  @xcite .",
    "the author has also considered the possibility of such metrics on quasi - projective manifolds in  @xcite , which is very complementary to this article .",
    "this article considers the following conjecture which first appeared in  @xcite .",

    "note that the inclusion of compactly supported cohomology in this case induces an inclusion @xmath30 .",
    "and @xmath28 is the subset of @xmath27 whose restriction to @xmath37 vanishes .",
    "also , if @xmath38 is a khler class in @xmath28 , then it has a d - dimensional neighborhood of khler classes , where @xmath39 .",

    "note also that @xmath40 is the number of prime divisors in the exceptional set @xmath41 .",
    "it is also useful to consider partial crepant resolutions @xmath0 where @xmath13 has only orbifold singularities .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] is valid without modification in this case also .",
    "many of the examples of sasaki - einstein manifolds @xmath42 have associated ricci - flat khler cones @xmath11 which do not admit crepant resolutions , but nonetheless admit such a partial crepant resolution .",
    "this is true of some of the examples constructed via hypersurface singularities in  @xcite and  @xcite , while some examples do admit crepant resolutions .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] solves a large portion of conjecture  [ con : main ] .",
    "but it is instructive to consider what it excludes .",

    "furthermore , @xmath29 is invariant under the compact @xmath50-torus @xmath14 .    as above , if a ricci - flat khler metric exists , then there is a d - dimensional , @xmath39 , family of such metrics . here",
    "@xmath40 is the number of lattice points in the interior of a polytope @xmath51 which is the intersection of the cone @xmath49 defining @xmath1 with a hyperplane .",

    "we give some examples .",
    "these are easily described by the toric geometry of the resolution @xmath0 in the toric case .",
    "many more examples are constructed in  @xcite using toric geometry and by resolving hypersurface singularities .",
    "recently the author has come up with a proof which removes the @xmath33 from the convergence in ( [ eq : asymp ] ) and thus gives the sharp convergence .",
    "this will appear in a subsequent article .",
    "we review some of the properties of sasaki manifolds .",
    "we are primarily interested in khler cones . but a khler cone is a cone over a sasaki manifold , and much research has been done recently on sasaki - einstein manifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    a riemannian manifold @xmath4 of dimension @xmath53 is sasakian if the metric cone @xmath15 , @xmath54 and @xmath6 , is khler .",

    "then @xmath65 in non - degenerate on @xmath66 and @xmath61 is a contact form on @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the restriction of the complex structure @xmath69 on @xmath26 , to @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath72 is a strictly pseudo - convex cr structure on @xmath42",
    ". we will denote the sasaki structure on @xmath42 by @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : cont ] ) that the khler form of @xmath15 is @xmath74 thus @xmath75 is a khler potential for @xmath38 .",
    "there is a 1-dimensional foliation @xmath76 generated by the reeb vector field @xmath57 . since the leaf space is identical with that generated by @xmath56 on @xmath26",
    ", @xmath76 has a natural transverse holomorphic structure .",
    "and @xmath77 defines a khler form on the leaf space .",
    "we denote the transverse khler metric by @xmath78 .",
    "note that when the sasaki structure on @xmath42 is regular ( resp .",
    "quasi - regular ) , the leaf space of @xmath76 is a khler manifold ( resp .",
    "orbifold ) .",
    "a p - form @xmath79 on @xmath42 is said to be _ basic _ if @xmath80 the basic p - forms are denoted by @xmath81 , where the foliation @xmath76 on @xmath42 must be fixed .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath82 is closed under the exterior derivative .",
    "so there is a transversal de rham complex which can be used to calculate the basic cohomology @xmath83 .",
    "the foliation @xmath76 associated to a sasaki structure has a transverse holomorphic structure , so there is a splitting @xmath84 of complex forms into types .",
    "and the exterior derivative on basic forms splits into @xmath85 , where @xmath86 has degree @xmath87 and @xmath88 has degree @xmath89 .",
    "thus we have as well the basic dolbeault complex and the basic dolbeault cohomology groups @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , the foliation has a transverse khler structure , and the usual hodge theory for khler manifolds carries over . in particular , we have the hodge decomposition @xmath91 and the representation of basic cohomology classes by harmonic forms .",
    "it is also useful to know that the @xmath92-lemma holds for basic forms as it does on khler manifolds .",
    "thus if @xmath93 is exact , then there is a basic @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be taken to be real if @xmath97 is .",
    "see the monograph  @xcite for a survey of these results .",

    ", @xmath101 is a non - degenerate contact form in that @xmath102 is nowhere zero .",
    "then we have a new sasaki structure on @xmath42 with the same reeb vector field @xmath57 , transverse holomorphic structure on @xmath76 , and holomorphic structure on @xmath26 .",
    "this sasaki structure has transverse khler form @xmath103 .",
    "one can show  @xcite that if @xmath104 then @xmath105 is the khler form on @xmath26 associated to the transversally deformed sasaki structure .",
    "[ prop : ricci ] let @xmath4 be a @xmath53-dimensional sasaki manifold",

    "@xmath4 is sasaki - einstein with the einstein constant being necessarily @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath15 is a ricci - flat khler .",
    "the khler structure on the leaf space of @xmath76 is khler - einstein with einstein constant @xmath107 .",
    "this follows from elementary computations .",
    "in particular , the equivalence of ( i ) and ( iii ) follows from @xmath108 where @xmath109 are lifts of @xmath110 in the local leaf space ; @xmath78 and @xmath111 are the metric and ricci tensor of the transversal khler structure .    given a sasaki structure we can perform a @xmath66-homothetic transformation to get a new sasaki structure . for @xmath112 set @xmath113 then @xmath114 is a sasaki structure with the same holomorphic structure on @xmath26 , and with @xmath115 .",
