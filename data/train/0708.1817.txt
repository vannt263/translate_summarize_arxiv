    "the supernova ( sn ) ia observations indicate the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the direct and model independent evidence of the acceleration of the universe was shown by using the energy conditions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the driving force of the late time acceleration of the universe , dubbed  dark energy ( de ) \" , imposes a big challenge to theoretical physics .",
    "although the cosmological constant is the simplest candidate of de and consistent with current observations , other possibilities are also explored due to many orders of magnitude discrepancy between the theoretical estimation and astronomical observations for the cosmological constant . for a review of de models ,",
    "see for example , @xcite .    there are model independent studies on the nature of de by using the observational data",
    ". in particular , one usually parameterizes de density or the equation of state parameter @xmath4 of de @xcite . due to the degeneracies among the parameters in the model ,",
    "complementary cosmological observations are needed to break the degeneracies . the wilkinson microwave anisotropic probe ( wmap ) measurement on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy ,",
    "together with the sn ia observations provide complementary data . in this paper",
    ", we use the three - year wmap ( wmap3 ) data @xcite , the sn ia data @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite to study the property of de and the cosmic curvature .",
    "two de models @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite are considered . in @xcite , the authors showed that combining the shift parameters @xmath7 and the angular scale @xmath8 of the sound horizon at recombination appears to be a good approximation of the full wmap3 data .",
    "wang and mukherjee gave model independent constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath8 by using the wmap3 data , they also provided the covariance matrix of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "so we use the shift parameter @xmath7 , the angular scale @xmath8 of the sound horizon at recombination and their covariance matrix given in @xcite instead to avoid using several inflationary model parameters and calculating the power spectrum . when the covariance matrix is used , we have six parameters .",
    "we use the monte - carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method to explore the parameter space .",
    "our mcmc code is based on the publicly available package cosmomc @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give all the formulae and show the constraint on the cosmic curvature is much better by using the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and their covariance matrix than that by using the parameter @xmath7 only .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the radiation component @xmath10 on @xmath8 . in section iii ,",
    "we give our results .",
    "we discuss the analytical marginalization over @xmath11 in appendix a.",
    "for the sn ia data , we calculate @xmath12 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_i},\\ ] ] where",
    "the extinction - corrected distance modulus @xmath13 + 25 $ ] , @xmath14 is the total uncertainty in the sn ia data , and the luminosity distance is @xmath15,\\ ] ] here @xmath16 and the dimensionless hubble parameter is @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , the cmb temperature @xmath21k , and @xmath22 is the de density . note that the distance normalization is arbitrary in the sn ia data , the hubble constant @xmath11 determined from the sn data is also an arbitrary number , not the observed hubble constant .",
    "therefore we need to marginalize over this nuisance parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is marginalized over with flat prior , the analytical marginalization method is discussed in appendix a. for the de model @xcite @xmath23 the dimensionless de density is @xmath24.\\ ] ] for the de model @xcite @xmath25 the dimensionless de density is @xmath26.\\ ] ]    for the sdss data , we add the term @xmath27 ^ 2\\ ] ] to @xmath28 @xcite , where the bao parameter @xmath29^{1/3}.\\ ] ]    for wmap3 data , we first add the term @xmath30 to @xmath28 @xcite , where the shift parameter @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "when we fit the de models ( [ lind ] ) and ( [ wzeq ] ) to the observational data , we have four parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the mcmc method is used to explore the parameter space .",
    "the marginalized probability of @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the cosmic curvature can not be well constrained for the de model ( [ lind ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the combination of the shift parameter and the angular scale of the sound horizon at recombination gives much better constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "so we add the angular scale of the sound horizon at recombination @xcite @xmath37 where the sound speed @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the scale factor , and @xmath41 @xcite . to implement the wmap3 data , we need to add three fitting parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "so we need to add the term @xmath42 to @xmath28 , where @xmath43 denote the three parameters for wmap3 data , @xmath44 and cov@xmath45 is the covariance matrix for the three parameters .",
    "follow wang and mukherjee , we use the covariance matrix for @xmath46 derived in @xcite .",
    "since the covariance matrix for the six quantities in @xcite is defined as the pair correlations for those variables , so each element in the matrix is obtained by marginalizing over all other variables .",
    "therefore , the covariance matrix between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the three by three sub - matrix of the full six by six matrix in @xcite . the marginalized probability of @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "we see that the cosmic curvature is constrained better with the addition of the angular scale @xmath8 of the sound horizon at recombination .",
    "since the angular scale of the sound horizon depends on the early history of the universe , so it strongly depends on @xmath10 .",
    "however , we can neglect the effect of @xmath10 when we evaluate the distance modules @xmath49 and the shift parameter @xmath7 because the universe is matter dominated .",
    "so only when we implement the cmb data with @xmath8 , we need to consider the effect of @xmath10 .",
    "we know the energy density @xmath50 of radiation , so the dependence of @xmath51 is manifested by the hubble constant @xmath11 . since we can neglect the effect of @xmath10 in fitting sn ia data ,",
    "so the effect of the observed value of @xmath11 can be neglected by marginalizing over it .",
    "therefore , we use the hubble constant @xmath11 as a free parameter instead of @xmath10 .",
    "the marginalized probabilities of @xmath34 for @xmath52 km / s / mpc and @xmath53 km / s / mpc are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the results indeed depend on @xmath11 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the combination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 approximates the wmap3 data and the wmap3 data depends on @xmath11 through @xmath8 .",
    "so , as expected , @xmath8 also depends on @xmath11 . from now on we also take @xmath11 as a fitting parameter , and impose a prior of @xmath54 km / s / mpc @xcite . to understand why we can marginalize over @xmath11 in fitting sn ia data and treat @xmath11 as a parameter in fitting wmap3 data",
    ", we should think that we actually treat @xmath10 , not @xmath11 as a parameter when fitting the wmap3 data .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is not the observed hubble constant when fitting the sn data because the normalization of the distance modulus was chosen arbitrarily . in summary",
    ", we have six fitting parameters for the de models ( [ lind ] ) and ( [ wzeq ] ) .",
    "in this section , we present our results .",
    "we first use the 182 gold sn ia data @xcite , then we use the essence data @xcite . for the sn ia data , we consider both the sn ia flux averaging with marginalization over @xmath11 @xcite and the analytical marginalization without the flux averaging .",

    "they obtained the result by fitting the data derived from a de model with @xmath62 with a flat model , so the result may not be conclusive . to see how the value of @xmath34 affect the constraints on the property of de , we perform the mcmc analysis on the de models ( [ lind ] ) and ( [ wzeq ] ) with @xmath63 .",
    "the results are reported in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "although the uncertainties of @xmath34 change the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the ranges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are almost the same for small @xmath34 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we first confirm previous results that the shift parameter @xmath7 alone does not give good constraint on @xmath34 , we must combine @xmath7 and @xmath8 to constrain @xmath34 . by using @xmath7 , @xmath8 and their covariance matrix ,",
