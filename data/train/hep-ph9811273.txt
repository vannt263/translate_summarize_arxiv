    "recent studies of non - equilibrium evolution of high energy density states have revealed novel and unexpected phenomena ranging from strong dissipative processes via particle production@xcite to novel aspects of symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "these non - equilibrium effects are crucial to understanding the end of inflation and the reheating problem@xcite .",
    "they are also conjectured to be relevant for baryogenesis , the partial restoration of symmetries during phase transitions@xcite , for the formation of defects during non - equilibrium phase transitions@xcite and reheating dynamics in gauge and fermionic theories@xcite .",
    "more recently a novel form of anomalous relaxation with non - universal critical exponents@xcite has been found in scalar field theories due to non - equilibrium quantum effects .",
    "one of the important aspects of these phenomena are their non - perturbative character .",
    "there are few consistent approaches that can be used for their description .",
    "while a classical approach has been advocated to address these issues@xcite we have emphasized the application of the large @xmath13 limit that captures both the quantum aspects as well as the emergence of classicality@xcite .",
    "the large @xmath13 limit in scalar field theories has a consistent implementation within the non - equilibrium quantum field theory formulation@xcite and the renormalization aspects had been studied in detail@xcite . furthermore it provides a consistent , renormalizable framework to study non - perturbative phenomena that can be systematically improved@xcite .    in this article",
    "we focus on further new non - equilibrium aspects .",
    "first , we discuss how non - perturbative particle production due to spinodal instabilities gives rise to a _",
    "dynamical _ version of the maxwell construction of statistical mechanics .",
    "it is a well known result that the static effective potential becomes complex in the region of the phase diagram in which coexistence of phases can occur .",
    "the imaginary part has been deemed to arise from a failure of the loop expansion , but a more careful treatment reveals that this imaginary part is actually related to the decay rate of a quantum mechanically unstable state@xcite .",
    "more precisely , the static effective potential approach is just not appropriate to study the dynamic of phase transitions . at the level of formal statistical mechanics ,",
    "the mixed phase is described via a maxwell construction that leads to an effective potential ( free energy ) that is flat in the coexistence region .",
    "the maxwell constructed effective potential has been confirmed by a careful analysis using the ` exact ' renormalization group@xcite of the _ equilibrium _ coarse grained free energy .    here",
    "we study the dynamical aspects of the maxwell construction in the large @xmath14 limit of a scalar field theory .",
    "we begin by reviewing the relevant features of the static effective potential in the large @xmath13 limit@xcite to highlight the fact that the imaginary part of the effective potential is _ not _ an artifact of the loop expansion but a more fundamental shortcoming of a static and equilibrium description of the coexistence region in terms of an homogeneous order parameter .",
    "we then study in detail how non - equilibrium dynamics , and in particular , particle production due to spinodal instabilities , leads to a flat dynamic potential in the region of coexistence .",
    "we find that _ all _ expectation values of the scalar field between the minima of the tree level potential are available asymptotically and that the asymptotic value is reached with a vanishing effective mass for the expectation value .",
    "this is the dynamical equivalent of a ` flat _",
    "dynamical _ potential ' and the availability of all possible asymptotic expectation values between the minima is the dynamical equivalent of the lever rule for coexistence of phases in the maxwell construction . for a given initial expectation value , such that the total energy density , @xmath15 , is smaller than the maximum of the tree level potential @xmath16 , [ here @xmath17 is the potential for the @xmath18 field @xmath19 , we find that the asymptotic expectation value depends on the initial conditions only through the total energy as follows @xmath20^x\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the renormalized quartic self - coupling and mass respectively and @xmath23 a new dynamical anomalous exponent which is universal in the weak coupling limit and given by @xmath24 .    in summary ,",
    "the _ dynamical _ effective potential is always * real * and is flat for @xmath25 .",
    "two physically different situations appear here :    \\a ) when the energy density @xmath26 is smaller than the maximum of the tree level potential , @xmath27 ( in terms of renormalized mass and coupling ) , the non - equilibrium dynamical evolution leads to broken symmetry states and the maxwell construction via non - perturbative particle production as a consequence of the spinodal instabilities .",
    "\\b ) when @xmath28 , in which case the energy density is larger than the maximum of the tree level potential , we find that the evolution is _ symmetric _ in that the time evolution of the expectation value of the scalar field samples the minima of the tree level potential symmetrically and ergodically with vanishing average over time scales much longer than the period .",
    "what we find is that this evolution is a consequence of the growth of the root mean square fluctuations due to parametric amplification which eventually induces a positive mass squared for the field .",
    "we show numerically that the expectation value relaxes to zero asymptotically transferring all of the energy to quantum fluctuations via parametric amplification in accord with the results in@xcite .",
    "our final topic concerns the quantum non - equilibrium dynamics of phase ordering in the @xmath29 model .",
    "this is an important topic and is the basis of the kibble mechanism for defect formation as the early universe cools through phase transitions@xcite .",
    "recently , there have been some attempts at constructing a non - equilibrium , real - time , description of the dynamics of this process@xcite .",
    "the early stages of the dynamics of phase ordering in quantum field theory models begin with the growth of spinodally unstable long - wavelength field modes and a dynamical correlation length emerges@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of non - equilibrium fluctuations during the early spinodally unstable stage has been studied and clarified recently providing a deeper understanding of the quantum fluctuations that trigger the process of phase ordering@xcite .",
    "we go beyond the early and intermediate time regime which is dominated by the linear instabilities , into the highly non - linear regime which is dominated by non - linear resonances@xcite and that begins at the spinodal time @xmath30 .",
    "this time scale determines the emergence of a semiclassical but _ stochastic _ description which we discuss and clarify .",
    "after @xmath31 , semiclassical , large amplitude ( @xmath32 ) field configurations are represented in the quantum density matrix with unsupressed probability .",
    "we find that for @xmath33 a true scaling solution emerges for which the field acquires a non - perturbative anomalous scaling ( length ) dimension @xmath7 , a dynamical correlation length @xmath34 emerges",
    ". in and the equal - time correlation function vanishes by causality at distances @xmath35 . in the non - linear regime",
    "we find the onset of a novel form of bose einstein condensation in which the zero momentum mode of the quantum fluctuations grows asymptotically linearly in time becoming macroscopically populated at long times .",
    "this condensation mechanism results in the equal time correlation function decreasing as @xmath11 for @xmath36 as a consequence of massless excitations .",
    "we find a crossover in the time dependence of the dynamical correlation length at the spinodal time @xmath31 : @xmath37 the process of phase ordering in this regime is described by the formation of domains that grow at the speed of light , inside of which there is a non - perturbative condensate of goldstone bosons .    in section",
    "ii we review the construction of the effective potential in the large @xmath13 limit and highlight several important features that are relevant for the dynamics namely    * the regime of validity of the scalar field theory as an effective theory below the energy scale of the landau pole @xmath38 , and the consistency of studying this theory for energy densities @xmath39 , *   the complex result for the effective potential in the coexistence region and the failure of such effective potential to describe dynamical aspects . in the large @xmath13 limit , this effective potential is _ exact _ and this complex value can not be blamed on a failure of the loop expansion but is a consequence of more fundamental shortcomings of an effective potential description .    in section",
    "iii we set up our study of the non - equilibrium dynamics in terms of the quantum density matrix in the large @xmath13 limit and its probabilistic interpretation .",
    "this formulation is the most enlightening to use use in order to discuss the emergence of classicality in terms of probability distributions .",
    "it also provides a natural framework in which to interpret the formation of semiclassical , large amplitude , field configurations that are represented in the quantum ensemble with unsuppressed probabilities .",

    "we distinguish between symmetric and non - symmetric evolution and provide a simple criterion for ergodic symmetric evolution in a broken symmetry potential .",
    "we contrast the energy with the effective potential and show that particle production provides a dynamical mechanism for the maxwell construction .",
    "section vi deals with the non - equilibrium process of phase ordering both in the linear and in the non - linear regime .",
    "we then compare our results to those of phase ordering kinetics in condensed matter physics@xcite and the scaling solution found in radiation and matter dominated friedmann - robertson - walker cosmologies for the non - linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in section vii .",
    "one of the main conclusions of our work is that the understanding of field theories to be found in the effective potential can be woefully lacking under certain circumstances . in order to better compare and contrast our dynamical results with what would have been expected from an effective potential analysis , and since there are some subtleties involved in the discussion of the large @xmath40 limit effective potential@xcite , we recapitulate this discussion below .",
    "there are two facets of the @xmath29 effective potential that we want to make contact with :    * scalar field theories can only be taken as effective field theories with a restricted regime of validity .",
    "the @xmath29 model is known to have a landau ghost at an energy scale @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the renormalized mass and coupling respectively , and can only be used reliably below this energy scale . a fuller analysis of the @xmath29 effective potential in the large @xmath40 limit determines the range of energy densities for which the theory can make sensible predictions . *",
    "the effective potential is _ complex _ in the spinodal region .",
    "this is what gives rise to the standard maxwell construction .",

    "as observed in @xcite , the inverse function @xmath94 has two branches as a function of @xmath95 .",

    "a consistent low energy effective theory emerges for energies well below @xmath97 [ see ref@xcite , sec .",

    "the pions are thus massive and the zero mode slowly dissipates its energy ( there is a non - zero threshold for particle production ) and attains the ground state ( @xmath113 ) very slowly , with an oscillatory behavior modulated in amplitude by a power law with anomalous relaxation exponent for asymptotically large time@xcite .",
    "we see that the static analysis through the effective potential agrees with the long time dynamics in the sense that the expectation value of the scalar field relaxes to the minimum of the effective potential , i.e. @xmath114 with oscillations that reflect a non - zero mass .",
    "in addition , the effective pion mass obtained asymptotically in the dynamical situation depends on the initial energy density ( which is conserved)@xcite .",
    "this dependence of course can not be captured by a static analysis which only applies to the ground state .",

    "we can thus safely ignore the existence of the tachyon .      in this case",

    "2 that @xmath126 for @xmath62 real in the interval @xmath127 with @xmath128 given by eq.([chi0 ] ) . equation ( [ potef ] ) and fig . 2 show that the minimum of the effective potential corresponds to @xmath129 .",

    "the fact that the minimum @xmath139 of the effective potential happens in the real configuration space ( for @xmath140 ) is in agreement with the asymptotic late time behavior found in refs.@xcite .",
    "there it was found that the dynamical ( time dependent ) effective mass of the pion fields tends asymptotically to zero for @xmath141 ( and initial energy below the false vacuum but above the ground state ) .",
    "the presence of massless particles allows the zero mode energy to dissipate efficently into them and the zero mode rapidly reaches the ground state .",

    "therefore , @xmath142 and @xmath73 as well as the effective potential become _ complex _ despite of the fact that the field @xmath95 is real .",

    "in which the effective potential computed from eq.([potef ] ) or eq.([potv ] ) turns to be complex , referred to as the spinodal region , the system is in a mixed state in which several phases coexist .",
    "the true equilibrium description of the system in the spinodal region is in terms of a maxwell constructed effective potential , which is flat in the coexistence region @xmath144@xcite .",
    "although such construction is rather arbitrary at the level of phenomenological statistical mechanics ( the lever rule ) , a consistent renormalization group analysis has revealed that the infrared limit of a carefully coarse grained effective action yields the maxwell constructed effective potential@xcite .",
    "we also note that in this case of continuous symmetry the spinodal region extends all the way from the maximum to the minimum of the potential without a region of metastability .",
    "this must be contrasted with the case of discrete symmetry , wherein the spinodal ends in the limit of metastability _ before _ the minimum of the potential .",
    "the fact that the spinodal region reaches from the maximum to the minimum of the potential is a consequence of the presence of goldstone bosons .    at this point",

    "<S> we analyze the non - equilibrium dynamics of the @xmath0 model in the large n limit with broken symmetry tree level potential and for states of large energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is dramatically different when the energy density is above the top of the tree level potential @xmath1 than when it is below it . </S>",
    "<S> when the energy density is below @xmath2 , we find that non - perturbative particle production through spinodal instabilities provides a dynamical mechanism for the maxwell construction . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic values of the order parameter only depend on the initial energy density and all values between the minima of the tree level potential are available , the asymptotic _ dynamical _ ` effective potential ' is flat between the minima . when the energy density is larger than @xmath2 , the evolution samples ergodically the broken symmetry states , as a consequence of non - perturbative particle production via parametric amplification . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we examine the quantum dynamics of phase ordering into the broken symmetry phase and find novel scaling behavior of the correlation function . there is a crossover in the dynamical correlation length at a time scale @xmath3 . for @xmath4 the dynamical correlation length @xmath5 and the evolution </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by linear instabilities and spinodal decomposition , whereas for @xmath6 the evolution is non - linear and dominated by the onset of non - equilibrium bose - einstein condensation of long - wavelength goldstone bosons . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> a true scaling solution emerges with a non - perturbative anomalous scaling length dimension @xmath7 and a dynamical correlation length @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the equal time correlation function in this scaling regime vanishes for @xmath9 by causality . for @xmath10 phase ordering proceeds by the formation of domains that grow at the speed of light , with non - perturbative condensates of goldstone bosons and the equal time correlation function falls of as @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> a semiclassical but stochastic description emerges for time scales @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared to phase ordering in _ classical _ stochastic descriptions in condensed matter and cosmology . </S>"
