    "in contrast to the original glauber model , defined by a non linear transition rate , with exact solutions restricted to @xmath24 , we can now write expressions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 in all dimensions @xmath0 . for @xmath27 ,",

    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is usually conceived for systems that do obey detailed balance callen51,kubo57 .",
    "it is then reasonable to ask some questions , including the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the presence of an aging regime , about the dynamical behavior of systems that do not obey detailed balance .",
