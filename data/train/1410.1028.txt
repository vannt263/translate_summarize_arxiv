    "if @xmath4co / hcn or c@xmath1o / hcn is used to constrain the dense gas fraction then there is a pronounced decrease in the dense gas fraction between the cnz and the bar arms , as expected given the lower star formation rate there .",
    "line ratios between hcn(10 ) , hco@xmath2(10 ) , hnc(10 ) and cn(10 ; 3/21/2 ) depend on gas physical conditions as well as chemistry .",

    "together these two effects suggest that hcn should be significantly brighter than hco@xmath2 in high density gas . in normal gas phase chemistry",
    "the hcn / hnc intensity ratio is driven to unity through the mutual formation reaction hcnh@xmath2 + e@xmath149 @xmath150 hnc / hcn + h ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in environments that are hot or",
    "have experienced strong shocks or pdr irradiation , hnc can be rapidly converted to hcn so this ratio can deviate significantly from unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus we expect hcn / hnc intensity ratios to be near unity over a wide range of high density gas conditions .",
    "where deviating from unity we expect hcn to be strongly favored in hot , disturbed gas .",
    "this is generally consistent with what we observe toward the more moderate starbursts , ic 342 and maffei 2 in papers i and ii @xcite .",
    "cn is expected to trace pdr gas and its chemistry is discussed in more detail in section [ pdr ] .",
    "finally it should be noted that high optical depth in these lines will act to hide any differences in the physical and chemical behavior , driving all the ratios to unity",

    "the nuclear starburst resides approximately in the middle of the observed ratio gradient in both cases , so no clear evidence is seen for a distinct component directly associated with the compact starburst .",
    "the fact that the hcn / hco@xmath2 intensity ratio is 1.0 toward the starburst suggests that densities are high enough to thermalize both transitions and that the opacities of both lines could be high .",
    "large velocity gradient modeling of hcn ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the inferred hcn abundance ( table [ molt ] ) is near that typically observed on large scales toward star forming clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "both hcn / hco@xmath2 and hcn / hnc have the same sense of trend , rising toward the west across the cnz .",
    "one possible model for these ratios is that the gas density is lower in the east away from the starburst , resulting in lower hcn / hco@xmath2 there , and warm pdr or shocked gas is more prevalent in the west near the starburst , favoring hcn emission and producing the high hcn / hnc line ratio there .",
    "the starburst and co column density peak , is located at the inner terminus of the northwestern bar arm , suggesting the western side of the nucleus to be hotter / more energetic @xcite . in this model",
    "the elevated hcn / hco@xmath2 is a better indicator of high gas density and hcn / hnc more reflective of high radiation fields .",
    "however opacity must also be considered .",
    "a second possible model is that line ratios near the starburst could instead be dominated by high hcn line opacity ; if hcn is opaque but the two lower abundance species , hco@xmath2 and hnc , transition from optically thick to thin from west to east , following the decline in co column , then the decline in hco@xmath2 and hnc brightness relative to hcn toward the east could be explained by their decline in opacity in this region .",

    "the nuclear starbursts in both iras 04296  and ngc  253 are close cousins , with iras 04296 s burst being somewhat more intense , at an earlier phase and residing in a possibly less processed disk .",
    "we have imaged emission from lines of dense gas tracers at 3 mm with ovro and carma toward the nearby lirg , iras 0496 + 2923 .",
    "the images have 3  to 4.5  spatial resolution , and cover the central arcminute region ( @xmath8 8.4 kpc in diameter ) .",
    "we have combined these data with archival ovro co data to study chemical effects of an intense nuclear starburst , sfr @xmath191 , on its gas .    1 .",
    "we confirm that iras 04296  is one of the brightest molecular line - emitting galaxies in the sky .",
    "we detect significant emission in co(10 ) , @xmath4co(10 ) , c@xmath1o(10 ) hcn(10 ) , hnc(10 ) , hco@xmath192(10 ) , cn(10 ; 3/21/2 ) , cn(10 ; 1/21/2 ) , and ch@xmath3oh . gas properties in iras 04296  are similar to those in the starburst galaxy ngc  253 ,",
    "although iras 04296  is more gas - rich .",
    "emission from the dense gas tracers , hco@xmath2 , hnc , and cn , is primarily confined to the inner @xmath193 500 pc ( 5 ) circum - nuclear zone ( cnz ) , and requires densities of @xmath194 here .",
    "it is within this component that the starburst is located .",
    "the co / hcn ratio in iras 04296  is @xmath195 for the inner @xmath196  pc region , and @xmath197 in most locations within the arms .",
    "this ratio traces the fraction of molecular gas that is dense , indicating nearly a factor of two higher dense - gas fraction in the nucleus as compared to the arms ( though two locations in the arms have co / hcn ratios comparable to the nucleus ) .",
    "the three co isotopic lines , which trace less dense gas , are detected across the central @xmath198  kpc ( @xmath199 ) diameter .",
    "@xmath109 , the co(10)/@xmath4co(10 ) line ratio , @xmath200 in the cnz ( @xmath201  pc ) of iras 04296  and falls to the very low value of @xmath115 by the outer end of the bar .",
    "the higher - than - galactic @xmath109  in the cnz is consistent with observations of other actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xmath59co(10)/c@xmath1o(10 ) , @xmath112 , follows the same pattern with @xmath112  @xmath202 in the nuclear starburst ",
    "cnz and falling to @xmath118 toward the outer disk .",
    "this trend is likely due to either lower opacities in co due to kinematics or to higher excitation temperature in the cnz , which removes molecules from the lowest co rotational levels .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath4co(10)/c@xmath1o(10 ) or @xmath113  is low , @xmath113  @xmath203 , in the cnz , and even lower in the outer bar , with @xmath113@xmath204 .",
    "interpretation of this unprecedentedly low ratio in terms of very high co opacities conflicts with the high observed co(10)/@xmath4co(10 ) .",
    "we can obtain barely consistent solutions for the co isotopic ratios if we adopt [ co]/[@xmath4co ] @xmath8 60 toward the nucleus of iras 04296 , increasing to 110 at the bar ends , and [ co]/[c@xmath1o]@xmath8200  225 .",
    "these values may indicate a relative lack of long term stellar processing in iras 04296  as compared to the galaxy . for the implied isotopic abundance ratios ,",
    "optically thin c@xmath1o(10 ) emission predicts a nuclear conversion factor @xmath80.5 times that of the galactic disk .",
    "the implied conversion factor in the bar arms are approximately equal ( or slightly larger ) than in the galactic disk , consistent with that found in @xcite .",
    "the observed global value of @xmath205 l@xmath6 ( k km s@xmath7 pc@xmath155 ) obtained for iras 04296  is nearly a factor of 1.5 times the standard global value for the ir to hcn luminosity ratio obtained by @xcite . excluding the non - cnz ir luminosity",
    ", we obtain a value for the cnz alone of @xmath206 l@xmath6 ( k km s@xmath7 pc@xmath155 ) for iras 04296 . from this",
    "we estimate a star formation rate relation @xmath207 , similar given the large systematic uncertainties , to that obtained by gao & solomon . + from lte analysis we find that the cn abundance is @xmath81.6 times the abundance of hcn , if hcn is optically thin",
    ". if hcn is optically thick then hcn can still be more abundant than cn . based on the models of @xcite",
    "the hcn / cn column density ratio indicates that the emission is coming from clouds at moderate depths of @xmath208 .",
    "this corresponds to the transition between pdrs and dark clouds .",
    "so the cnz is moderately influenced by pdrs .",
    "the hcn / cn ratio decreases radially from the starburst in the cnz .",
    "this may suggest that pdr - influenced gas extends well beyond the compact starburst coupled with a drop in characteristic a@xmath209 .",
    ".   bright emission from the ch@xmath10oh molecule indicates that grain chemistry is important on large scales in iras 04296 .",
    "we are unable to reproduce the emission from models of collections of compact sources , and conclude that only a widespread mechanism such as shocks along spiral arms can explain the observed brightnesses of these species",
    ". a tentative detection of ch@xmath10oh at a galactocentric radius of @xmath1112 kpc is presented .",
    "the ch@xmath3oh abundance in this region are comparable to those found in the cnz . 7 .",
    "all lines of evidence , including the unusual co isotopologue ratios and co / hcn vs. @xmath11 , indicate that the starburst in iras 04296  is very young , which is consistent with previous suggestions based on bar - fueling of the starburst @xcite .",
