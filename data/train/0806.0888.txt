    "this is not because of the detection limit as noted above , but because of the ` identification limit ' , owing to a large beam size of current ( sub)mm telescopes used for surveys .",

    "* ) , and hence the detection limit in the radio has set the upper limits on redshifts of identified smgs @xcite . the best way to identify optical counterparts of smgs is to have high resolution submm images with interferometers @xcite .",
    "although time consuming , it allows us to perform direct optical / near - infrared ( nir ) identifications from the submm position .",
    "here we adopt another method of direct optical identification using optical / nir colours of galaxies around the submm source .",
    "the expected number of random optical / nir associations within the error circle of the submm position is not negligible ; e.g. there would be @xmath14 @xmath1-band sources ( @xmath15 on average within a @xmath16 radius ( see below ) .",
    "however , if smgs have rather confined optical - nir colours and the surface density of objects with similar colours is reasonably low , it will be possible to directly identify smgs without using costly high - resolution submm images .",
    "as in the radio identification method @xcite , we can calculate the formal significance of each optical / nir association , given the number counts of colour - selected galaxies . to do this",
    "we need a firm basis for the colours of smgs .    since the discovery of smgs , extremely red objects ( eros ) usually defined with @xmath17 or @xmath18 and distant red galaxies with @xmath19",

    "this enhancement is rather moderate as if smgs follow the same sfr-@xmath62 relation . in the local universe ,",
    "such a moderate enhancement is , for example , found for m82 ( figure 18 in elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ) , whose starburst activity is likely to be induced by interactions with m81 . compared to local ulirgs , this enhancement is less significant by an order of magnitude .",
    "we estimate the sfr enhancement of local ulirgs to be a factor of @xmath88 ( the dotted arrow ) , comparing the mean sfr and @xmath62 of local ulirgs with the sfr-@xmath62 relation of local star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is a lower limit , since we use the dynamical mass for local ulirgs .",
    "if progenitors of smgs are bzks with a stellar mass comparable to smgs , then the sfr enhancement could _ not _ be as high as local ulirgs .",
    "as @xcite indicated , smgs are probably experiencing maximum starbursts @xcite , determined roughly by the dynamical time scale of galaxies and negative feedback due to super novae .",
    "the maximum sfr expected for smgs would be around 600m@xmath23yr@xmath29 @xcite , which is already comparable to the observed sfrs .",
    "what are implications of a moderate ( @xmath89 ) sfr enhancement of smgs ? in the local universe , such a moderate enhancement is found for typical interacting pairs of galaxies ( not necessarily in the most luminous merging phase ) with a projected distance of @xmath90 kpc @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation by also indicates that a typical enhancement of sfr during the major merger phase is only a factor of @xmath91 .",
    "if this moderate enhancement is a typical case at @xmath0 as well , the fraction of smgs in star - forming bzks could be as high as the merger fraction .",
    "although the merger fraction at @xmath92 is quite uncertain , it would be at least similar to or higher than the value at @xmath9 of @xmath10% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of the hierarchical clustering properties of the galaxy formation process .",
    "this argument leaves us an open question why the fraction of smgs in bzks is not @xmath93 per cent , but only @xmath94 per cent . a bias of the submm surveys , which tend to miss galaxies as luminous as smgs but with higher dust temperatures , should play a role here , but the effect would be only a factor of @xmath95 @xcite . also we are missing some fraction of radio - undetected , and hence cool - dust smgs , which are not extremely red ( see section 4.2 ) . even if we consider luminous dusty galaxies at @xmath0 with both higher and lower dust temperatures , a correction for the incompleteness would be less than an order of magnitude , and therefore not enough to reconcile the apparent inconsistency .",
    "we could explain this apparent inconsistency between the rareness of smgs and its moderate sfr enhancement as follows .",
    "at @xmath0 , galaxy interactions may be too common , which means that high specific sfrs ( mass - normalized sfrs ) of bzks are a result of galaxy interactions to some extent . in this case",
    ", there would be almost no net enhancement of sfr in typical interacting galaxies over the sfr-@xmath62 relation .",
    "the sfr enhancement of smgs looks moderate , but might be indeed significant as galaxies at @xmath0 , possibly caused only by rare merging events , such as those with some particular orbit parameters , very equal mass ratios , or multiple mergers .",
    "for example , according to the numerical simulation by , high gas concentrations and hence high sfr enhancement can be realized not in direct mergers , but in retrograde mergers .",
    "we should bare in mind that smgs are not the only galaxy population experiencing major mergers .",
    "smgs will merely be a tip of iceberg .",
    "@xcite suggest that uv morphologies of bzks and uv - selected ( bx / bm ) galaxies are not distinguishable from that of smgs .",
    "this indicates either that not only smgs but also bzks and bx / bm galaxies are experiencing merger - induced starbursts , or simply that the uv morphology is not a reliable indicator of a major merger .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite show that smgs are a dynamically distinctive galaxy population with large mass concentration , i.e. dynamically hotter than bzks and bx / bm galaxies .",
    "therefore , the uv morphology may not be very useful to identify dynamically hot galaxies at @xmath96 , as suggested by no obvious correlations between the uv morphology and other galactic properties , such as sfr , outflow and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "we need more direct measures on dynamical properties of galaxies at @xmath0 , in order to identify kin of smgs . for this purpose ,",
    "atacama large millimeter array ( alma  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will play an important role , which is capable of measuring gas dynamics of @xmath7-mjy sources , such as bzks @xcite .",
    "we identify optical - nir counterparts of 28 radio - detected smgs , including multiple associations , in the shades / sxdf , and have compiled optical and near - infrared photometry of these sources .",
    "we then investigate optical / near - infrared colours ( @xmath2 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) of radio - detected smgs , along with the additional sample from the hdf , to find that almost all of @xmath1-faint ( @xmath99 ) smgs have @xmath100 , i.e. bzks .",
    "this forms a strong basis of identifying radio - undetected smgs using bzks around submm sources .",
    "we calculate the formal significance ( @xmath6 value ) for individual bzks around radio - undetected smgs , and found 6 robust ( @xmath101 ) identifications , including one double identification .",
    "all of these new identifications but one are extremely red , i.e. @xmath41/bzks or @xmath42/bzks .",
    "it turns out that the current positional uncertainty is too large to use bare bzks for the direct optical identification .",
    "however , this result is encouraging for future exploitation of smgs at @xmath21 using a combination of longer wavebands , such as @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    from a comparison of observed surface densities , we find that only @xmath94 per cent of bzks , eros and drgs are smgs , while this fraction is as high as @xmath102% for the bzk - ero - drg overlapping population , @xmath103bzks .",
    "the average sfr of bzk - selected smgs is @xmath56680m@xmath23yr@xmath29 .",
    "if smgs are major mergers of typical disk - like star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 , i.e. bzks , the enhancement of sfr occurring in smgs would be only a factor of @xmath563 .",
    "this enhancement is an order of magnitude lower than that of local ulirgs .",
    "such a moderate enhancement of sfr is found in ordinary galaxy pairs with a separation of @xmath104kpc in the local universe , and not significant at all .",
    "thus , the rareness of smgs at @xmath0 is rather puzzling .",
    "this may be because the sfr of star - forming bzks is already enhanced by galaxy interactions to some extent , and hence the moderate sfr enhancement of smgs over bzks could indeed be significant as a galaxy at @xmath0 . a quantitative explanation on statistical properties of ulirgs near and far would be a challenging task for the theory of galaxy formation , requiring clear understanding of galaxy evolution and the physics of galaxy interactions .",
