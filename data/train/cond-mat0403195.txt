    "<S> although the thermoelectric effect vanishes identically in the strict born and unitary limits , even a small deviation of the phase shift from these limits leads to a large response , especially in clean systems . we also discuss possibilities of measuring counter - flowing supercurrents in a squid - setup . the non - quantized thermoelectrically induced flux can easily be of the order of a percent of the flux quantum in clean systems at @xmath0 temperatures . </S>"
