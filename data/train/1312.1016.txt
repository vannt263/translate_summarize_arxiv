    "intermittent pulsars are a special class of part - time radio pulsars ( kramer et al . 2006 ; mclaughlin et al . 2006 ; camilo et al . 2006 ; wang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "they have been observed long time scales nulling .",
    "they emit radiation switching between on state and off state .",
    "psr b1931@xmath024 ( the first intermittent pulsar , kramer et al .",
    "2006 ) exhibits the alternation of on state ( 5@xmath210 d ) and off state ( 25@xmath235 d ) , which is about 38-day quasi - periodicity ( young et al . 2013 ) .",
    "thereafter , camilo et al . ( 2012 ) and lorimer et al . (",
    "2012 ) successively presented extraordinary long term off state of psr j1841@xmath10500 and psr j1832@xmath00029 between their respective on states .",
    "more significantly , the spindown rate of the intermittent pulsar during the on state is larger than that during the off state . for psr b1931@xmath024",
    ", it enhances @xmath250% during its on state compared to its off state . for psr j1841@xmath10500 and psr j1832@xmath00029 ,",
    "the enhancement is around 150% and 77% , respectively .",
    "many scenarios have been proposed for intermittent pulsars ( mainly centered on psr b1931@xmath024 ) , e.g. , pulsar with orbiting objects ( li 2006 ) , reactivated dead pulsars or nulling pulsars viewed at the opposite direction ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) , non - radial oscillation ( rosen et al . 2011 ) , precession ( jones 2012 ) . however , it is still a puzzle that what is account for the on / off transition and why the rotation slows down faster when the pulsar is on than when it is off .",
    "an effective model is that an additional particle flow slows down the rotation when the pulsar is on ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ) . a magnetospheric model is presented by li et al . ( 2012b ) for the spindown of intermittent pulsars .",
    "but the particle acceleration is not considered in these models ( the magnetospheric model considered the particle acceleration by introducing a finite conductivity ) .",
    "particle acceleration is crucial for the generation of pulsar radio ( and high energy ) emission .",
    "the pulsar wind model of xu & qiao ( 2001 ) considered the effect of particle wind plus magnetic dipole braking .",
    "different particle acceleration models are considered there .",
    "this pulsar wind model is applied to the three intermittent pulsars , i.e. , psr b1931 + 24 , psr j1841@xmath10500 , and psr j1832 + 0029 .",
    "the spindown ratio between the on and off state depends on the particle acceleration potential and the magnetic inclination angle . for each source ,",
    "their magnetic field and inclination angle in different acceleration potentials are calculated .",
    "meanwhile , the theoretical braking indices for them are also shown .",
    "rotational energy loss rate in the presence of a particle wind is calculated in section 2 .",
    "applying the pulsar wind model to intermittent pulsars is given in section 3 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "pulsars may be viewed as an oblique rotating dipole .",
    "the magnetic moment has both a parallel component and a perpendicular component relative to the rotation axis .",
    "the rotational energy loss rate due to the perpendicular magnetic moment may be approximated by the magnetic dipole braking(shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath5 is the angular rotation rate of the neutron star , @xmath6 is the speed of light , and @xmath7 is the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic axis ( i.e. , magnetic inclination angle ) . the effect of parallel magnetic moment is associated with particle acceleration ( e.g. , inner vacuum accelerator , ruderman & sutherland 1975 )",
    ". the rotational energy loss rate due to this component may be written as ( i.e. , particle wind , xu & qiao 2001 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is polar cap radius , @xmath10 is charge density in the acceleration region , @xmath11 is corresponding acceleration potential .",
    "the polar cap radius is @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is neutron star radius ) if the large scale magnetic field geometry is of dipole form .",
    "observationally , the different on states of intermittent pulsars are quite stable ( i.e. , no significant variations between different on states , lorimer et al .",
    "2012 ; young et al . 2013 ) .",
    "one way to achieve this is that the charge density in the acceleration region is always the same .",
    "the most naturally value for the charge density is the goldreich - julian density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "therefore , we chose @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is polar magnetic field .",
    "the polar magnetic field is related with the magnetic moment as @xmath16 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the presence of acceleration potential can accelerate primary particles .",
    "secondary particles are generated subsequently .",
    "these particles are responsible for the radio ( and high energy ) emissions of pulsars .",
    "meanwhile , they will also contribute to the rotational energy loss rate of the central neutron star .",
    "there are various proposals for the acceleration potential ( see xu & qiao 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "different acceleration potential results in different rotational energy loss rate .",
    "therefore , pulsar timing observations can be employed to distinguish between different particle acceleration models .",
    "the maximum acceleration potential for a rotating dipole is ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the rotational energy loss rate due to the particle wind can be rewritten as @xmath18 the total rotational energy loss rate is the combination of the perpendicular component and the parallel component . assuming the magnetic dipole component and the particle wind component",
    "contribute independently , the total rotational energy loss rate is @xmath19 noting that the particle component may be mainly related with the parallel magnetic moment .",
    "the parallel magnetic moment is @xmath20 . taking this point into consideration ,",
    "the corresponding rotational energy loss rate is ( xu & qiao 2001 ) @xmath21 the above two cases are named case i and case ii , respectively ( according to the time order when they first appear in literature ) .",
    "case i was originally considered by xu & qiao ( 2001 ) .",
    "similar expression was also obtained by contoupolous & spitkovsky ( 2006 ) .",
    "case ii is also possible considering recent numerical simulations ( spitkovsky 2006 ; li et al .",
    "these two cases only differ by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the total rotational energy loss rate in the presence of a particle wind can be rewritten as ( xu & qiao 2001 ) @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( case i ) .",
    "given the acceleration potential @xmath11 , @xmath25 and the rotational energy loss rate are known .",
    "the simplest case may be a constant acceleration potential ( yue et al .",
    "if acceleration potential @xmath26 , then @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is polar magnetic field in units of @xmath29 ) .",
    "various physically motivated particle acceleration models are proposed since ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath25 for various acceleration models are listed in table [ tab_eta ] . the corresponding expression for case ii",
    "can be obtained by dropping the factor @xmath22 .",
    "xu & qiao ( 2001 ) described six pulsar emission models , i.e. , two vacuum gap ( vg ) models , three space charge limited flow ( sclf ) models and the outer gap ( og ) model . in the vacuum gap model ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , the situation that primary electrons emit @xmath30-rays via curvature radiation is named cr - induced and the one that primary electrons emit @xmath30-rays via resonant inverse compton scattering off the thermal photons ( e.g. , zhang et al . 2000 ) is named ics - induced . for the sclf model ( e.g. , arons & scharlemann 1979 ; harding & muslimov 1998 ) ,",
    "regimes i and ii are considered , which are respectively defined as the extreme cases without or with field saturation .",
    "three models are included , i.e. , the cr - induced sclf model in regime ii , the ics - induced sclf model in regime ii and the sclf model in regime i. the potential drop , which is model dependent , is different in each model , so is the @xmath25-value .",
    "the following calculations will be mainly for case i. the calculation in case ii is similar and will be discussed later .",
    ".expressions of @xmath25 for seven particle acceleration models ( mainly from xu & qiao 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the neutron star radius is taken as @xmath31 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath32 : sclf ( ii , ics ) can already be ruled out .",
    "case ii differs from case i quantitatively . when obtaining the spindown ratio of intermittent pulsars ( equation ( [ equation2 ] ) ) , many unknown factors are concealed ( e.g. the moment of inertia , the magnetic dipole moment ) .",
    "and the observed spindown ratio is just a factor of two ( from 1.5 to 2.5 ) .",
    "therefore , in modeling the spindown ratio of intermittent pulsars , the rotational energy loss rate has to be accurate within a factor of two ( relative to magnetic dipole braking case ) . for case",
    "ii , equation ( [ equation1 ] ) is still valid .",
    "the expression for the spindown ratio in case ii is @xmath33 generally , @xmath34 ( see table [ tab_eta ] . for case",
    "ii , @xmath35 does not include @xmath22 . ) .",
    "using equation ( [ equation1 ] ) , equation ( [ equation2_caseii ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the characteristic magnetic field in units of @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath38 , and considering the polar magnetic field is always larger than or equal to the characteristic magnetic field , there is a lower limit on the spindown ratio in each acceleration model @xmath39 observationally , psr b1931 + 24 has the smallest spindown ratio : @xmath40 ( kramer et al .",
    "acceleration potentials with their minimum spindown ratio larger than 1.5 can be ruled out . at the same time , if the corresponding magnetic inclination angle is very small and the polar magnetic field is too large , then the acceleration potential is also not favored .",
    "only two models meet these two criteria : sclf ( ii , cr ) and the constant acceleration potential model .",
    "the magnetic inclination angle in case ii is similar to the corresponding values in case i ( at most a few degrees larger ) .",
    "the particle wind component may only work for part of the time ( harding et al .",
    "1999 ; tong et al .",
    "denote the duty cycle of particle wind as @xmath41 ( fractional time when the particle wind is present ) , the long term averaged spindown of the pulsar is ( harding et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the long term averaged spindown rate . for intermittent pulsars , from equation ( [ edot ] ) and ( [ edotd ] ) , equation ( [ dp ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath44 therefore , the duty cycle of particle wind can be determined from timing observations @xmath45 at present , only psr b1931 + 24 had @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 reported ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ) . from the long term averaged spindown ,",
    "the duty cycle of its particle wind is @xmath49 . in the pulsar wind model",
    ", the presence of particle wind corresponds to the on state .",
    "then the duty cycle of particle wind should be the same as the duty cycle of the on state .",
    "kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated that the duty cycle of the on state is @xmath50 .",
    "later study gave a duty cycle of the on state @xmath51 ( young et al .",
    "the two duty cycles , one obtained from long term averaged spindown ( equation ( [ dp2 ] ) ) and one from radiation monitoring , are consistent with each other .",
    "we suggest future timing observations of intermittent pulsars give not only its spindown rate during the on / off state ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) but also the long term averaged spindown rate ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "in pulsar researches , the magnetic dipole braking assumption is often employed , e.g. , in calculating the characteristic magnetic field and the characteristic age .",
    "the magnetic dipole braking assumes a rotating perpendicular dipole in vacuum .",
    "a real pulsar must have a magnetosphere ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "pulsars can radiate radio and high energy photons .",
    "therefore , in the pulsar magnetosphere there must be some kind of particle acceleration and radiation .",
    "previous studies showed that the magnetic dipole braking assumption is correct to the lowest order approximation ( goldreich & julian 1969 ; xu & qiao 2001 ; contoupolous & spitkovsky 2006 ) . when considering higher order effects ,",
    "e.g. braking index , timing noise , and intermittent pulsars , physically based models must be employed .",
    "therefore , the magnetic dipole braking model is just a pedagogical model ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the characteristic magnetic field is just the effective magnetic field ( all the torque terms are attributed to a perpendicular dipole field ) .    applying the pulsar wind model of xu & qiao ( 2001 ) to the three intermittent pulsars , we calculated their corresponding inclination angles and braking indices .",
    "table [ tab_inclination ] and [ tab_index ] show that the results are quite different from each other .",
    "it is because they have different acceleration potentials . in modeling the particle wind component ,",
    "only one kind of acceleration potential is considered .",
    "the real case may allow the coexistence of different acceleration potentials ( e.g. , a core gap and a more extended one , qiao et al .",
    "2007 ; du et al . 2010 ) .",
    "when intermittent pulsars have more observations , it will be necessary to check the coexistence of different acceleration potentials .",
    "considering the seven acceleration potentials in table [ tab_inclination ] and table [ tab_index ] ( one of them can already be ruled out ) , we suggest that the curvature induced vacuum gap model ( vg ( cr ) model , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) be compared with observations first .    from the above calculations ,",
    "the inverse compton scattering induced space charge limited flow with field saturation ( i.e. , the sclf ( ii , ics ) model ) can already be ruled out .",
    "the corresponding magnetic inclination angle is too small and the polar magnetic field is in the magnetar range . on the other hand",
    ", this may actually happen in some magnetars .",
    "magnetars may be wind braking and some of them may have a small inclination angle and a very high dipole magnetic field ( tong & xu 2012 ; tong et al .",
    "2013 ) . for psr j1841@xmath10500 ,",
    "its inclination angle is also relatively small in the constant acceleration potential ( cap ) case .",
    "this depends on the gap potential adopted ( @xmath52 at present ) .",
    "if the gap potential is @xmath53 , then the consequent inclination angle will be @xmath54 degrees .",
    "the spindown behavior of intermittent pulsars looks like a glitch in the interval between successive on states ( e.g. , figure 1 in camilo et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , a more physically motivated explanation is that the absence of particle outflow is responsible for both the cessation of radio emission and the lower slow down rate during the off state ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ; and this paper ) .",
    "the opposite case is also possible : during the observational interval , the particle wind may be significantly stronger .",
    "then the spindown behavior of the pulsar will look like a negative glitch .",
    "such negative glitch has already been observed in one magnetar ( i.e. , anti - glitch , archibald et al .",
    "a stronger particle wind during the observational interval can explain the anti - glitch ( tong 2014 ) .",
    "therefore , the spindown behavior of intermittent pulsars and anti - glitch can be understood uniformly in the wind braking scenario .",
    "the effective model proposed by kramer et al . ( 2006 ) explains the different spindown ratio of intermittent pulsars by a different particle density .",
    "psr j1841@xmath10500 has the largest spindown ratio ( @xmath55 ) . adopting the prescription of kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the required plasma density is three times the goldreich - julian density ( lorimer et al . 2012 ) . in our model , the charge density in the acceleration region ( i.e. , primary particles ) can always be the goldreich - julian density .",
    "a constant amount of charged particles accelerated may ensure that different on states of intermittent pulsars are stable ( young et al .",
    "kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) employed the pulsar wind model of harding et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to treat the wind torque .",
    "it is equivalent to the case that the accelerated particles can attain the maximum potential ( tong et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the real case",
    ", the acceleration gap must break down somewhere due to pair screening ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "it also assumed an orthogonal rotator when calculating the surface dipole field using the off state spindown rate .",
    "in our pulsar wind model , physically motivated particle acceleration potentials are taken into consideration . for a specific particle acceleration potential ,",
    "the spindown ratio is determined by the magnetic inclination angle ( see figure [ fig_ratio ] ) . the surface dipole field and the magnetic inclination angle",
    "are solved simultaneously .    in the pulsar wind model considered in this paper ,",
    "there is a particle wind torque in addition to the magnetic dipole torque during the on state .",
    "therefore , the spindown rate should always be larger in the on state than in the off state .",
    "previous literatures also discussed the possibility of no dipole radiation during the on state ( e.g. , geurevich & istomin 2007 ) . from equation ( [ equation2 ] ) , if there is no dipole term in the on state , the spindown ratio will be proportional to @xmath56 ( see also geurevich & istomin 2007 ; beskin & nokhrina 2007 ) . for large inclination angle , the spindown ratio can be smaller than one .",
    "some intermittent pulsars are expected to have smaller spindown rate in the on state than in the off state . however , the present three sources all have larger spindown rates during the on state .",
    "therefore , it is more likely that the dipole term coexists with the particle wind term in the on state of intermittent pulsars ( and normal pulsars ) .",
    "li et al . ( 2012b ) modeled the spindown of intermittent pulsars using different states of pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "their work is from the magnetohydrodynamical simulation point of view .",
    "the current of charged particles is modeled by introducing some dissipation in the magnetosphere .",
    "the li et al .",
    "( 2012b ) model can be viewed as macroscopic version of particle wind . while this work treats the particle wind from the microscopic point of view .",
    "the spindown ratio also depends on the magnetic inclination angle in li et al .",
    "( 2012b ) .",
    "( 2012b ) and this work predict quantitatively different inclination angles ( see figure 4 there and figure 1 in this paper ) .",
    "our pulsar wind model can predict the braking index of the intermittent pulsar ( with braking index between one and three ) .",
    "since intermittent pulsars are very weak , therefore large telescope ( e.g. , arecibo and the five hundred meter aperture spherical radio telescope , known as fast ) is required to make polarization observations . in the future",
    ", fast pulsar survey may discover more intermittent pulsars ( nan et al .",
    "polarization observations of more intermittent pulsars will help us to test different models of pulsar magnetospheres . in combination with green bank telescope ( and",
    "other large telescopes ) , the braking index of intermittent pulsars ( the present three sources and more ones to be discovered ) may be measured .",
    "for one intermittent pulsar , if the spindown ratio , the magnetic inclination angle , and the braking index are all measured , they will provide very strong constraint on our understanding of pulsar magnetospheres .    in summary , the pulsar wind model of xu & qiao ( 2001 )",
    "is employed to explain the spindown behavior of intermittent pulsars .",
    "the enhanced spindown during the on state is due to the presence of an additional particle wind . in modeling the pulsar wind ,",
    "the effect of particle acceleration is included . using the measured spindown ratio , the magnetic field and the inclination angle of intermittent pulsars",
    "are solved simultaneously .",
    "their predicted braking indices are also shown .",
    "the density of the accelerated particles can always equal to the goldreich - julian density .",
    "this may guarantee that different on states of intermittent pulsars are very stable .",
    "the duty cycle of particle wind can be determined from the long term averaged spindown .",
    "it is consistent with the cycle of the on state .",
