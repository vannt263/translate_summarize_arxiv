    "the @xmath11 is also catalogued as a three star resonance and has been advocated by many groups , the latest ones @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath11 is not `` seen '' in the gwu analysis of @xcite nor in former analyses of this group @xcite . in a recent unified chew - mandelstam",
    "said analysis of pion photoproduction data the resonance is not needed again @xcite , and it is also not included in the maid analysis of photoproduction data @xcite where only four star resonances are considered , but it is one of the resonances included in the analysis of the bonn - gatchina group @xcite and shows more clearly in the analysis of the @xmath12 data in @xcite .",
    "one common conclusion from @xcite is the strong coupling of the @xmath11 state to the @xmath2 ( d - wave ) channel , something not intuitive nor expected from ordinary quark models .",
    "we should note that , as discussed in @xcite there could be some reason to miss some resonances in the analysis if the resonances are too wide ( @xmath13500 mev ) or they posses a small ratio ( br@xmath14 ) to the channel under consideration .    in view of the current discussion about these two resonances , and particularly the doubts casted on the existence of the @xmath11",
    ", we have done a different analysis , purely theoretical , although paying attention to known data on the @xmath15 channel .",
    "the work consist on taking four coupled channels , also considered in @xcite , the @xmath0 ( s - wave ) , @xmath1 ( d - wave ) , @xmath2 ( s - wave ) and @xmath2 ( d - wave ) .",
    "we look in the region of @xmath16 mev and take the interaction between these channels from the local hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite , then solve the bethe salpeter equation in coupled channels and from this fully unitary approach we find two resonances dynamically generated by the interaction of these channels , which are naturally associated to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances .",
    "the freedom of the theory in the choice of subtraction constants to regularize the loops is used to fit the data on the @xmath1 ( d - wave ) amplitude .",
    "the study provides the poles and the residues of the resonances and their coupling to the different channels , widths and partial decay widths .",
    "a fair agreement is obtained with phenomenology and the two resonances appear as poles in the complex plane . in particular",
    "a relatively strong coupling of the @xmath5 to the @xmath2 ( d - wave ) suggested in @xcite is confirmed .",
    "the results that we find are also illustrative on why some analyses do not find a compelling need for the @xmath5 resonance and we clarify the situation by comparing the amplitudes obtained in this case with the @xmath8 amplitude in the scalar - isoscalar sector , where the @xmath17 and @xmath6 resonances appear .",
    "the presence of a first resonance with a width that makes it overlap with a second one with the same quantum numbers has consequences on the second resonance and the amplitude with these quantum numbers , producing a zero of the @xmath1 or @xmath8 amplitudes , respectively , in the vicinity of the second resonance , which makes its coupling to these channels very weak and makes difficult the identification of the @xmath5 resonance in the @xmath1 channel .",

    "next step is to find the poles associated to those peaks , in order to obtain the couplings of these states to the different channels .",
    "the method used is to search poles in the second riemann sheet , changing the momentum @xmath36 to @xmath77 in the analytical formula of the @xmath63 function when @xmath78 is over the threshold of the corresponding channel .",
    "using this method one can find poles , as @xmath79 , where the real part correspond to the mass of the resonance and the imaginary part is half of the width of this state .",

    "one novelty in our work is that the @xmath139 is dynamically generated in our approach , while in @xcite is an input resonance .",
    "the @xmath139 was obtained as a dynamically generated state in @xcite using coupled channels and input from chiral lagrangians . in the present case we have taken only the main @xmath144 channel , but it is well known that effects of other channels can be incorporated by small changes in the subtraction constants of dimensional regularization , which in the present problem we have left as free parameters .",
    "the other novelty is the @xmath140 that we also obtain as dynamically generated with our input .",
    "it is interesting to remark that in the work of @xcite , with the input of non pole terms there was also a state around 1700 mev which was dynamically generated and a pole could be seen in the third riemann sheet defined there .",
    "however when the pole terms were added , the pole in the amplitude fades away in that approach . in our work",

    "the unitarization of the driving terms in all the channels that we consider , including the transition between all of them , generates in our case the two poles and their interference is responsible for the vanishing amplitude of @xmath1(d ) around 1700 mev , which is consistent with the experiment .",
    "however , physical traces experimentally identifiable as a peak , remain in the @xmath141(d ) channel as one can see in fig.[fig : t2res ] , hence , the more intuitive picture of a peak in a cross section is also seen here but only in the @xmath1(d ) channel .",
    "actually in @xcite , the most characteristic feature attributed to the @xmath140 was its large coupling to @xmath1(d ) .",
    "we should also mention that there are other works that mix pseudoscalars and vectors @xcite and others that also include decuplet of baryons @xcite , this latter one invoking su(3 ) spin - isospin symmetry . in our approach",
    "we have followed strictly the local hidden gauge formalism that has proved to be very successful in a variety of processes ( see recent review @xcite ) .",
    "we have done a theoretical study for the meson - baryon scattering in the region of @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",

    "the interaction of these channels was taken from the local hidden gauge approach and the loops were regularized using dimensional regularization with subtraction constant of natural size .",
    "these constants were varied within a moderate range to obtain a good fit to the @xmath1 ( d - wave ) data .",
    "after this , the rest are predictions of the theory .",
    "the first important theoretical finding is that the model obtained , after fitting exclusively the @xmath1 ( d - wave ) data , produces two poles : one around 1480 mev that we associate to the @xmath4 and another around 1670 mev that we associate to the @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth noting that the presence of the two poles is rather solid , since they remain by making changes in the parameters that do not spoil massively the agreement with the @xmath1 ( d - wave ) experimental data .",
    "with the model obtained we determined partial decay widths to all the channels .",
    "we found an excellent agreement with experiments for the data on the @xmath4 and rough to fair for the @xmath5 .",

    "so in the s - wave for a @xmath98-exchange we can sum the momenta products as @xmath165 and we have shown for @xmath166 that @xmath167 the sum of the pion propagator and the kroll - ruderman for the first diagram gives us @xmath168        we need also to evaluate the s - wave and d - wave mixing , @xmath0 is in @xmath101 but @xmath2 can be in @xmath101 and @xmath103 since there is enough momentum for @xmath139 and @xmath140 . with @xmath0 below threshold there is no need to worry about @xmath103 for @xmath0 .",
    "we want to work with @xmath0(s ) , @xmath2(s ) and @xmath2(d ) , for this we shall also include the @xmath172 transition .",
    "let us evaluate the transition @xmath173 thought an intermediate state @xmath2 as shown in fig  [ fig : rhonboxs](a ) .",
    "let us take the third component of spin @xmath45 and @xmath102 for @xmath89 and @xmath20 respectively , to get @xmath174 since the result does not depend on the third component . with this choice , both polarizations",
    "@xmath151 and @xmath175 will be the same and we have neglected the momentum @xmath176 .",
    "the terms of the four vertex are @xmath177 we can put together the polarization terms and the isospin transition operators and use that @xmath178 for the polarization terms we have in the loop integral @xmath179 as @xmath180 .",
    "now , all together we have @xmath181 including both @xmath101 and @xmath103 contributions . for s - wave we got @xmath182 for one pion exchange ( see eq.([eq : swaveq2 ] ) ) so , the box equivalent operator with only s - wave will be @xmath183 subtracting this from the total transition ( eq .  ( [ eq : totalds ] ) )",
    "we get the d - wave transition in the box @xmath184 so finally we obtain that for the d - wave transition of one pion exchange the contribution is @xmath182 , the same one as for the s - wave transition .",
    "all the other terms are the same but without the kroll - ruderman factor which only comes in @xmath101 .",
    "thus , @xmath185      in the case of @xmath186 ( d - wave ) transition , the s - wave for @xmath46 does not exist , so whatever comes out will be d - wave .",
    "we use the same procedure as for @xmath2 , we chose the third component of spin to be @xmath46 . the diagram is shown in fig  [ fig : rhonboxs](b ) and the operators of the vertices are @xmath187 in the same way @xmath188 and for the polarization we have the same result as eq .",
    "( [ eq : pola ] ) .",
    "so we get @xmath189 the result for each vertex in the @xmath186 ( d - wave ) is @xmath190 .        next we must do the isospin combination and the charge factors for each vertex as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhonpinall ] . @xmath194 looking at the diagrams , the isospin factor for the transition @xmath186 ( d - wave ) will be @xmath195 finally we have @xmath196      j.  beringer _",
