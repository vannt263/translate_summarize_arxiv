    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamics of reheating and thermalization of light particles which are produced from the perturbative decay of the scalar field , especially paying attention to the case with a small decay width of the scalar field , such as the one given by planck - suppressed interactions . since the number density is under occupied in this case , number violating splittings with small momentum exchanges and the evolution of the soft sector play crucial roles in the dynamics towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "importantly , the bottleneck process is the dissipation of remaining hard particles into the soft sector as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of qgp .    following their arguments , we have studied thermalization after / during reheating in detail , while paying attention to the red - shift of previously produced particles before the completion of reheating and to the dilution of their number density by the cosmic expansion .",
    "we have shown that thermalization takes place instantaneously in most cases , and also found that red - shifted previously produced particles are not relevant since radiated soft particles dominate the number density of red - shifted previously produced ones and that radiation is always dominated by that from hardest primaries which are not red - shifted .",
    "the condition under which produced particles thermalize before the completion of reheating is given by @xmath3 which turns out to be much milder than that obtained in the previous work  @xcite because the growth of the soft sector promotes the dissipation of remaining hard particles . as a result ,",
    "even if the mass of the scalar field is as large as @xmath4 , it is shown that thermalization takes place instantaneously in most cases .",
    "our result is applicable to general situations where a decay of a non - relativistic matter reheats the universe via a small decay width and the decay products contain particles that are charged under a non - abelian gauge group .    our analysis can also be applied to the instant preheating scenario  @xcite in which produced light particles have small number densities compared with thermal ones .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the case we have considered and hence our result is helpful in estimating the time scale when non - perturbative particle production is shut off by rescatterings  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
