    "it has been known for some time that the remarkable coherence  @xcite and control characteristics  @xcite of donor spin qubits in silicon , combined with potential cmos - compatibility , make silicon a highly attractive platform for quantum technologies .",
    "nevertheless , a scalable coupling strategy robust to manufacturing imperfections has yet to emerge .",
    "early silicon donor - based proposals , such as the kane  @xcite proposal , envisaged large exchange ( i.e.  wavefunction overlap ) interactions to couple donor spin qubits .",
    "such proposals have spurred the development of techniques now able to offer near - perfect donor placement  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the multivalley nature of the silicon conduction band makes exchange coupling vary by over an order of magnitude if the donor spacing is incorrect by even a single atom  @xcite .",
    "a robust spin - photon interface could solve this problem by allowing coupling and readout of qubits using cavity quantum electrodynamics ( ` c - qed ' ) .",
    "unfortunately , the weak magnetic dipole moment of the spins themselves makes a direct magnetic coupling approach using microwave photons and superconducting cavities unsuitable  @xcite .",
    "a more recent proposal  @xcite involves precisely placing a donor near an si / sio@xmath2 interface in the very large electric field regime , where the donor electron is partially ionized and possesses a ground - state electric dipole moment ; the decoherence characteristics of this environment are presently unknown .    in this work we present a new , scalable platform for donor qubits in silicon that is robust to placement variations , and does not drastically modify the spins isolated ground states which are responsible for their ultra - long coherence times . in short , we propose harnessing the native electric dipole transitions available within donor qubits excited state optical structure , and coupling these optical transitions through cavity qed enabled by silicon photonic circuitry .",
    "the most well - studied silicon donor qubits , namely the group v hydrogenic ` shallow ' donors such as phosphorus , do not offer suitable optical transitions .",
    "shallow donors have small binding energies ( @xmath3 mev ) with excited state optical transitions in the technically onerous @xmath410 thz range  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , shallow donors offer near - infrared no - phonon donor - bound - exciton transitions  @xcite , yet these are very weak optical transitions with highly nonradiative decay  @xcite . despite these limitations , proposals for optically controlling shallow donors",
    "have been made  @xcite .",
    "here we propose to exploit the electric - dipole allowed optical transitions available to ` deep ' donors , such as the chalcogen double donors sulfur , selenium and tellurium @xcite . in their neutral state",
    "these helium - like double donors bind two electrons , with deep binding energies ( @xmath5 mev ) .",
    "when singly - ionized , the remaining electron has an even larger binding energy ( 614 mev for @xmath6 , 593 mev for @xmath7 , and 411 mev for te@xmath8  @xcite ) , and a hydrogenic ( or he@xmath8 ) orbital structure with optical transitions in the mid - infrared ( ` mid - ir ' )  @xcite . in @xmath9:@xmath10 the optical transitions between the ground spin states to the lowest excited state are sufficiently narrow to be spin selective even at very low , or zero , magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "these donors can be implanted into the large mode maximum of photonic structures , far from interface noise sources , and the resulting strong coupling will enable single - spin , single - shot readout at 4.2  k , and indirect multi - qubit coupling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the system : the qubits and optical transitions under consideration . then we present verification data to justify some main claims of the proposal .",

    "secondly , electric fields or strain can be used to tune the optical transition frequencies of individual donors .",
    "this can be used to compensate for photonic cavity frequency mismatch ; the resonant frequency of soi photonic cavities are relatively fixed at a given temperature and display some manufacturing variability .",
    "these tuning capabilities offer the prospect of dynamically adjusting the donors optical frequencies for selective control and coupling , without compromising the long - lived spin qubit ground states .",
    "these spin - selective optical transitions broaden above 4.2  k by thermal activation into @xmath14 .",
    "higher - temperature operation may be possible by using a highly strained substrate which not only repopulates the states spin - valley composition but also shifts their excited - state splittings @xcite . from a decoherence perspective",
    ", the thermal density of states matching the @xmath20 optical transition is negligible at 4.2 k. even a high - q cavity s amplification of the density of states at the @xmath20 optical frequency is expected to result in a negligible enhancement of spin decoherence .",
    "consequently , this c - qed scheme will a ) avoid purcell decoherence of the qubits and b ) not contribute significantly to an orbach or raman indirect spin relaxation process .",

    "the @xmath20 states form a lambda transition with similar decay rates , and a resonant single photon could be used to deterministically drive a conditional raman transition . furthermore",

    "the polarization and frequency of photon emitted from @xmath89 will in general be frequency- and polarization - entangled with the remaining spin qubit state .",
    "triggered single photons can be coupled into a nearby waveguide , and parity measurements between multiple waveguided photons can be used to entangle emitters from distinct modules , both within and between devices @xcite .",
    "this entanglement need not be particularly pure @xcite ; the other donors present in each module can be used to swap and purify a poor initial distributed entangled state .",
    "cluster states @xcite could be built from these building blocks .",
    "we have proposed a new method of measuring and coupling donor spin qubits in silicon by exploiting the parity - allowed optical transitions of singly - ionized deep donors in silicon within photonic cavity qed devices .",
    "we have shown that these transitions emit light and that their spin ground states are long - lived near 4.2  k and in earth s magnetic field .",
    "this cmos - compatible platform does not rely upon millikelvin temperatures , large magnetic fields , or interface charge dynamics . using this strategy",
    "the spin qubits will preserve their bulk - like decoherence properties and the readout and coupling mechanisms will be robust to the variations in strains and electric fields present in realistic devices .",

    "<S> donor impurity spins in silicon-28 are highly competitive qubits for upcoming solid - state quantum technologies , yet a proven scalable strategy for multi - qubit devices remains conspicuously absent . </S>",
    "<S> these cmos - compatible , atomically identical qubits offer significant advantages including 3-hour coherence ( @xmath0 ) lifetimes , as well as simultaneous qubit initialization , manipulation and readout fidelities near @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these properties meet the requirements for many modern quantum error correction protocols , which are essential for constructing large - scale universal quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> however , a method of reliably coupling spatially - separated qubits , which crucially does not sacrifice qubit quality and is robust to manufacturing imperfections , has yet to be identified . here </S>",
    "<S> we present such a platform for donor qubits in silicon , by exploiting optically - accessible ` deep ' chalcogen donors . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these donors emit highly uniform light , can be optically initialized , and offer long - lived spin qubit ground states without requiring millikelvin temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these combined properties make chalcogen donors uniquely suitable for incorporation into silicon photonic architectures for single - shot single - qubit readout as well as for multi - qubit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this unlocks clear pathways for silicon - based quantum computing , spin to photon conversion , photonic memories , silicon - integrated triggered single photon sources and all - optical silicon switches . </S>"
