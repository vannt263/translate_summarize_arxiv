    "cassiopeia a is the brightest shell - type galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) in x - rays and radio , and the youngest snr observed in our galaxy .",
    "the radius of the approximately spherical shell is @xmath15 , which corresponds to @xmath16 pc for the distance @xmath17  kpc ( reed et al .",
    "the supernova which gave rise to cas a was probably first observed in 1680 ( ashworth 1980 ) .",
    "it is thought to be a type ii supernova caused by explosion of a very massive wolf - rayet star ( fesen , becker & blair 1987 ) .",
    "optical observations of cas a show numerous oxygen - rich fast - moving knots ( fmk ) , with velocities of about 5000  km  s@xmath4 , and slow - moving quasi - stationary flocculi , with typical velocities of about 200  km  s@xmath4 , which emit h@xmath18 and strong lines of nitrogen .",
    "x - ray observations of cas a show numerous clumps of hot matter emitting strong si , s , fe , ar , ne , mg and ca lines ( holt et al .",
    "1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "because this snr lies at the far side of the perseus arm , with its patchy distribution of the interstellar gas , the interstellar absorption varies considerably across the cas a image ( e.g. , keohane , rudnick & anderson 1996 ) .",
    "numerous radio , optical and x - ray measurements of the hydrogen column density ( e.g. , schwarz , goss & kalberla 1997 ; hufford & fesen 1996 ; jansen et al .",

    "based on recent results , we consider @xmath21 as plausible values for the central region of the cas a image .    in spite of considerable efforts to detect",
    "a compact remnant of the supernova explosion only upper limits on its flux had been established at different wavelengths until a pointlike x - ray source was discovered close to the cas a center ( tananbaum et al .",
    "1999 ) in the first light observation with the  x - ray observatory ( see weisskopf et al .",
    "1996 for a description ) . after this discovery ,",
    "the same source was found in the  hri image of 199596 ( aschenbach 1999 ) and  hri images of 1979 and 1981 ( pavlov & zavlin 1999 ) .    in this letter we present the first analysis on the central source spectrum observed with  (  2 ) , together with the analysis of the , , and _ asca _ observations (  3 ) .",
    "various interpretations of these observations are discussed in  4 .",
    "the snr cas a was observed several times during the  orbital activation and calibration phase . for our analysis",
    ", we chose four observations of 1999 august 2023 with the s array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire 1997 ) . in these observations",
    "cas a was imaged on the backside - illuminated chip s3 . the spectral response of this chip",
    "is presently known better that those of the frontside - illuminated chips used in a few other acis observations of cas a. we used the processed data products available from the public  data archive .",
    "the observations were performed in the timed exposure mode , with a frame integration time of 3.24  s. the durations of the observations were 5.03 , 2.04 , 1.76 , and 1.77  ks .",
    "because of telemetry saturation , the effective exposures were 2.81 , 1.22 , 1.06 , and 1.05 ks , respectively . since the available acis response matrices were generated for the set of grades g02346 , we selected events with these grades .",
    "events with pulse height amplitudes exceeding 4095 adu ( @xmath22 of the total number ) were discarded as generated by cosmic rays .",
    "the images of the pointlike source look slightly elongated , but this elongation is likely caused by errors in the aspect solution , and the overall shapes of the images is consistent with the assumption that this is a point source .",
    "its positions in the four observations are consistent with that reported by tananbaum et al .",
    "( 1999 ) : @xmath23 , @xmath24 . for each of the images",
    ", we extracted the source+background counts from a @xmath25 radius circle around the point source center , and the background from an elliptical region around the circle , with an area of about 10 times that of the circle . after subtracting the background",
    ", we obtained the source countrates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ks@xmath4 ( counts per kilosecond ) .",
    "the countrate values and the light curves are consistent with the assumption that the source flux remained constant during the 4 days , with the countrate of @xmath30 ks@xmath4 .    for the analysis of the point source spectrum , we chose the longest of the acis - s3 observations .",
    "we grouped the pulse - height spectrum for 306 source counts into 14 bins in the 0.85.0  kev range ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "each bin has more than 20 counts ( except for the highest - energy bin with 8 counts ) .",
    "the spectral fits were performed with the xspec package .",
    "if the source is an active pulsar , we can expect that its x - ray radiation is emitted by relativistic particles and has a power - law spectrum . the power - law fit ( upper panel of fig .",
    "2 ) yields a photon index @xmath31 ( all uncertainties are given at a @xmath32-@xmath33 confidence level ) that is considerably larger than @xmath342.1 observed for x - ray radiation from youngest pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) .",
    "the hydrogen column density , @xmath35 , inferred from the power - law fit somewhat exceeds estimates obtained from independent measurements ( see  1 ) .",
    "the ( unabsorbed ) x - ray luminosity in the 0.15.0  kev range , @xmath36  erg  s@xmath4 , where @xmath37 , is lower than those observed from very young pulsars ( e.g. , @xmath38 and @xmath39  erg  s@xmath4 for the crab pulsar and psr b054069 , in the same energy range ) .",
    "if the source is a neutron star ( ns ) , but not an active pulsar , thermal radiation from the ns surface can be observed .",
    "the blackbody fit ( middle panel of fig .",
    "2 ) yields a temperature @xmath40  mk and a sphere radius @xmath41  km , which correspond to a bolometric luminosity @xmath42  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "( we use the superscript @xmath43 to denote the observed quantities , distinguishing them from those at the ns surface : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47^{1/2}= [ 1 - 0.41 m_{1.4}r_6^{-1}]^{1/2}$ ] is the gravitational redshift factor , @xmath48 and @xmath49  cm are the ns mass and radius ) .",
    "the temperature is too high , and the radius is too small , to interpret the detected x - rays as emitted from the whole surface of a cooling ns with a uniform temperature distribution .",
    "the inferred hydrogen column density , @xmath50 , is on a lower side of the plausible @xmath51 range .",
    "since fitting observed x - ray spectra with light - element ns atmosphere models yields lower effective temperatures and larger emitting areas ( e.  g. , zavlin , pavlov & trmper 1998 ) , we fit the spectrum with a number of hydrogen and helium ns atmosphere models ( pavlov et al .",
    "1995 ; zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ) , for several values of ns magnetic field .",
    "these fits show that the assumption that the observed radiation is emitted from the whole surface of a 10-km radius ns with a uniform temperature still leads to unrealistically large distances , @xmath5250 kpc .",
    "thus , both the blackbody fit and h / he atmosphere fits hint that , if the object is a ns , the observed radiation emerges from hot spots on its surface ( see  4 ) .",
    "an example of such a fit , for polar caps covered with a hydrogen atmosphere with @xmath53  g , is shown in the bottom panel of figure  2 .",
    "the model spectra used in this fit were obtained assuming the ns to be an orthogonal rotator ( the angles @xmath18 , between the magnetic and rotation axes , and @xmath54 , between the rotation axis and line of sight , equal @xmath55 ) .",
    "the inferred effective temperature of the caps is @xmath56  mk ( which corresponds to @xmath57  mk ) , the polar cap radius @xmath58  km , and @xmath59 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of two polar caps is @xmath60  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "the temperature @xmath61 can be lowered , and the polar cap radius increased , if we see the spot face - on during the most part of the period  extreme values , @xmath62  mk ( @xmath63  mk ) and @xmath64  km , at @xmath65 , correspond to @xmath66 .",
    "the fits with the one - component thermal models implicitly assume that the temperature of the rest of the ns surface is so low that its radiation is not seen by acis .",
    "on the other hand , according to the ns cooling models ( e.g. , tsuruta 1998 ) , one should expect that , at the age of 320 yr , the ( redshifted ) surface temperature can be as high as 2  mk for the so - called standard cooling ( and much lower , down to 0.3 mk , for accelerated cooling ) .",
    "to constrain the temperature outside the polar caps , we repeated the polar cap fits with the second thermal component added , at a fixed ns radius and different ( fixed ) values of surface temperature @xmath67 . with this approach we estimated upper limits on the lower temperature , @xmath682.3  mk ( at a 99% confidence level ) , depending on the low - temperature model chosen .",
    "these fits show that the model parameters are strongly correlated  the increase of @xmath67 shifts the best - fit @xmath61 downward , and @xmath69 upward .",
    "for example , using an iron atmosphere model for the low - temperature component and assuming a hydrogen polar cap , we obtain an acceptable fit ( see fig .",
    "1 ) for @xmath70  mk , @xmath71  km , @xmath72  mk , @xmath73  km , @xmath74 . note that this @xmath67 is consistent with the predictions of the standard cooling models , and @xmath51 is close to most plausible values adopted for the central region of the snr .",
    "we reanalyzed the archival data on cas a obtained during a long  hri observation , between 1995 december  23 and 1996 february  1 ( dead - time corrected exposure 175.6  ks ) .",
    "the image shows a pointlike central source at the position @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( coordinates of the center of the brightest @xmath77 pixel ) , consistent with that reported by aschenbach ( 1999 ) .",
    "its separation from the  point source position , @xmath78 , is smaller than the  absolute pointing uncertainty ( about @xmath79 ; briel et al .",
    "measuring the source countrate is complicated by the spatially nonuniform background .",
    "another complication is that the 40-day - long exposure actually consists of many single exposures of very different durations . because of the absolute pointing errors , combining many single images in one leads to additional broadening of the point source function ( psf ) . to account for these complications",
    ", we used several apertures ( with radii from @xmath25 to @xmath80 ) for source+background extraction , measured background in several regions with visually the same intensity as around the source , discarded short single exposures , and used various combinations of long single exposures for countrate calculations .",
    "this analysis yields a source countrate of @xmath81 ks@xmath4 ( corrected for the finite apertures ) .",
    "we also re - investigated the archival data on cas a obtained with the  hri in observations of 1979 february 8 ( 42.5  ks exposure ) and 1981 january 2223 ( 25.6  ks exposure ) . in each of the data sets there is a pointlike source at the positions @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , respectively , consistent with those reported by pavlov & zavlin ( 1999 ) .",
    "the separations from the  position , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and from the  position , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are smaller than the nominal absolute position uncertainty ( @xmath90 for ) . since the observations were short , estimating the source countrates is less complicated than for the  hri observation .",
    "the source+background counts were selected from @xmath91-radius circles , and the background was measured from annuli of @xmath92 outer radii surrounding the circles .",
    "the source countrates , calculated with account for the hri psf ( harris et al .  1984 ) , are @xmath93 ( feb 1979 ) , @xmath94  ks@xmath4 ( jan 1981 ) , and @xmath95  ks@xmath4 ( for the combined data ) .",
    "the countrate is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath96 ks@xmath4 , derived by murray et al .",
    "( 1979 ) from the longer of the two observations .    to check whether the source radiation varied during the two decades",
    ", we plotted the lines of constant  and  hri countrates in figure 2 .",
    "for all the three one - component models , the domains of model parameters corresponding to the  hri countrates within a @xmath97 range are broader than the 99% confidence domains obtained from the  spectra .",
    "the 1-@xmath33 domains corresponding to the  hri countrate overlap with the 1-@xmath33 confidence regions obtained from the spectral data .",
    "thus , the source countrates detected with the three instruments do not show statistically significant variability of the source .",
    "we also examined numerous archival _ asca _ observations of cas a ( 19931999 ) and failed to detect the central point source on the high background produced by bright snr structures smeared by poor angular resolution of the _ asca _ telescopes . in the longest of the _ asca _ sis observations ( 1994 july 29 ; 15.1 ks exposure ) the point source would be detected at a 3-@xmath33 level if its flux were a factor of 8 higher than that observed with , , and .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "observations show that there were no strong outbursts of the central source .",
    "the observed x - ray energy flux , @xmath98 , of the compact central object ( cco ) is 3.6 , 6.5 , and @xmath99  erg  @xmath100  s@xmath4 in 0.32.4 , 0.34.0 and 0.36.0  kev ranges , respectively .",
    "upper limits on its optical - ir fluxes , @xmath101  erg  @xmath100  s@xmath4 and @xmath102  erg  @xmath100  s@xmath4 , can be estimated from the magnitude limits , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , found by van den bergh & pritchet ( 1986 ) .",
    "this gives , e.g. , @xmath105 for the  energy range , and @xmath106 for the  and  ranges .",
    "the flux ratios are high enough to exclude coronal emission from a noncompact star as the source of the observed x - ray radiation . a hypothesis that cco is a background agn or a cataclismic variable",
    "can not be completely rejected , but its probability looks extremely low , given the high x - ray - to - optical flux ratio , the softness of the spectrum , and the lack of indications on variability .    the strong argument for cco to be a compact remnant of the cas",
    "a explosion is its proximity to the cas a center . in particular",
    ", this source lies @xmath80@xmath107 south of the snr geometrical center determined from the radio image of cas a ( see reed et al .  1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the source separation , @xmath108@xmath91 , from the snr expansion center , found by van den bergh & kamper ( 1983 ) from the analysis of proper motions of fmks , corresponds to a transverse velocity of 50250 km  s@xmath4 ( for @xmath5 kpc , @xmath109 yr ) .",
    "much higher transverse velocities , 8001000 km  s@xmath4 , correspond to the separation , @xmath110@xmath111 , from the position of the apparent center of expanding snr shell derived by reed et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from the radial velocities of fmks .",
    "thus , if cco is the compact remnant of the sn explosion , it is moving south ( or sse ) from the cas a center with a transverse velocity of a few hundred km  s@xmath4 , common for radio pulsars .",
    "if cco is an isolated ( nonaccreting ) object , it might be an active pulsar with an unfavorable orientation of the radio beam ( a limit on the pulsed flux of 80 mjy at 408 mhz was reported by woan & duffett - smith 1993 ) .",
    "however , a lack of a plerion or a resolved synchrotron nebula , together with the steep x - ray spectrum and low luminosity ( see  2 ) do not support this hypothesis .",
    "the lack of the pulsar activity has been found in several x - ray sources associated with young compact remnants of sn explosions ( e.g. , gotthelf , vasisht & dotani 1999 ) ; it may be tentatively explained by superstrong ( @xmath112  g ) magnetic fields which may suppress the one - photon pair creation in the pulsar s acceleration gaps ( baring & harding 1998 ) .",
    "if cco is an isolated ns without pulsar activity , one may assume that the observed x - rays are emitted from the ns surface .",
    "in this case , we also have to assume an intrinsically nonuniform surface temperature distribution to explain the small size and high temperature of the emission region .",
    "slight nonuniformity of the surface temperature can be caused by anisotropy of heat conduction in the strongly magnetized ns crust ( greenstein & hartke 1983 ) .",
    "however , this nonuniformity is not strong enough to explain the small apparent areas of the emitting regions .",
    "some nonuniformity might be expected in magnetars , if they are indeed powered by decay of their superstrong magnetic fields ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) and a substantial fraction of the thermal energy is produced in the outer ns crust . in this case , the hotter regions of the ns surface would be those with stronger magnetic fields .",
    "if additional investigations will demonstrate quantitatively that the observed luminosity of @xmath113 erg  s@xmath4 can be emitted from a small fraction , @xmath114 , of the magnetar s surface , we should expect that the radiation is pulsed , with a probable period of a few seconds typical for magnetars .",
    "we can also speculate that cco is a predecessor of a soft gamma - repeator ( such a hypothesis has been proposed by gotthelf et al .",
    "1999 for the central source of the kes 73 , which shows a spectrum similar to cco , albeit emitted from a larger area ) .",
    "higher temperatures of polar caps can be explained by different chemical compositions of the caps and the rest of the ns surface .",
    "light - element polar caps could form just after the sn explosion via fallback of a fraction of the ejected matter onto the magnetic poles .",
    "due to fast stratification in the strong gravitational field , the upper layers of the polar caps will be comprised of the lightest element present .",
    "the thermal conductivity in the liquid portion of thin degenerate ns envelopes , which is responsible for the temperature drop from the nearly isothermal interior to the surface , is proportional to @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the ion charge ( yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) .",
    "this means that low-@xmath116 envelopes are more efficient heat conductors than high-@xmath116 ones , so that a light - element ( h , he ) surface has a higher effective temperature for a given temperature @xmath117 at the outer boundary of the internal isothermal region",
    ". approximately , the effective surface temperature is proportional to @xmath118 if the chemical composition of the envelope does not vary with depth , so that the surface of a hydrogen envelope can be @xmath119 times hotter than that of an iron envelope . numerical calculations of chabrier , potekhin & yakovlev ( 1997 ) give a smaller factor ( 1.61.7 for temperatures of interest ) , with account for burning of light elements into heavier ones in the hot bottom layers of the envelope , but neglecting the effects of strong magnetic fields which can somewhat increase this factor ( heyl & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "hence , the light - element cap should be hotter than the rest of the ns surface .",
    "for instance , for @xmath120  mk , the effective temperatures of the h cap and fe surface are @xmath121 mk and @xmath122 mk , for @xmath123 , @xmath71 km .",
    "as we have shown in  2 , a two - component model spectrum with such temperatures is consistent with the observed cco spectrum , for @xmath124  km .",
    "the thickness of the hydrogen cap , @xmath125 g  @xmath100 , needed to provide such a temperature difference , corresponds to the total cap mass @xmath126 . for lower @xmath127 , the temperature difference will be smaller , but still appreciable for @xmath128 .",
    "such an explanation of the cco radiation is compatible only with the standard cooling scenario  the difference of chemical compositions could not account for a large ratio , @xmath129 , of the cap and surface temperatures required by the accelerated cooling .",
    "let us consider the hypothesis that the observed x - ray radiation is due to accretion onto a ns or a black hole ( bh ) . to provide a luminosity @xmath130  erg  s@xmath4 , the accretion rate should be @xmath131  g  s@xmath4 , where @xmath132 is the accretion efficiency ( @xmath133 for accretion onto the surface of a ns ) .",
    "although the luminosity and the accretion rate are very small compared to typical values observed in accreting binaries , they are too high to be explained by accretion from circumstellar matter ( csm )  very high csm densities and/or low object velocities relative to the accreting medium are required .",
    "for instance , the bondi formula , @xmath134 , gives the following relation between the csm baryon density @xmath135 and velocity @xmath136 km  s@xmath4 : @xmath137  @xmath138 .",
    "even at @xmath139 , which is lower than a typical pulsar velocity , the required density exceeds that expected in the cas  a interiors by about 34 orders of magnitude , unless the ns or bh moves within a much denser ( and sufficiently cold ) csm concentration . this estimate for @xmath135 can be considered as a lower limit because accretion onto a bh , or onto a ns in the propeller regime , is much less efficient .",
    "we can not , however , exclude that cco is accreting from a secondary component in a close binary or from a fossil disk which remained after the sn explosion .",
    "we can rule out a massive secondary component  from the above - mentioned @xmath140 and @xmath141 limits , we estimate @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "we can also exclude a persistent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) or a transient lmxb in outburst  the object would have a much higher x - ray luminosity than observed , and the accretion disk would be much brighter in the ir - optical range ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "however , cco might be a compact object with a fossil disk , or an lmxb with a dwarf secondary component , in a long - lasting quiescent state ( e.g. , an m5 dwarf with @xmath144 would have @xmath145 , for the adopted distance and extinction ) . an indirect indication that cco could be a compact accreting object is that its luminosity and spectrum resemble those of lmxbs in quiescence , although we have not seen variability inherent to such objects .",
    "if the accreting object were a young ns , it would be hard to explain how the matter accretes onto the ns surface  a very low magnetic field and/or long rotation period , @xmath146  s , would be required for the accreting matter to penetrate the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the criterion suggested by rutledge et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to distinguish between the ns and bh lmxbs in quiescence , based on fitting the quiescent spectra with the light - element ns atmosphere models , favors the bh interpretation , although the applicability of this criterion to a system much younger than classical lmxbs may be questioned . on the other hand , in at least some of bh binaries optical radiation emitted by the accretion flow",
    "was detected in quiescence ( e.g. , narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) at a level exceeding the upper limit on the cco optical flux .",
    "finally , one could speculate that the cco progenitor was a binary with an old ns , and this old ns has sufficiently slow rotation and low magnetic field to permit accretion onto the ns surface from a disk of matter captured in the aftermath of the sn explosion . in this case",
    ", cco could have properties of an accreting x - ray pulsar with a low accretion rate .",
    "( a similar model was proposed by popov 1998 for the central source of rcw 103 , although he assumed accretion from the ism . )    to conclude , we can not firmly establish the nature of cco based on the data available  it can be either an isolated ns with hot spots or a compact object ( more likely , a bh ) accreting from a fossil disk or from a dwarf binary companion .",
    "although the cco spectrum and luminosity strongly resemble those of other radio - quiet compact sources in snrs , these sources may not necessarily represent a homogeneous group  e.g. , the central source of kes 73 shows 11.7 s pulsations and remarkable stability , and was proposed to be a magnetar ( gotthelf et al .",
    "1999 ) , whereas the central source of rcw 103 shows long - term variability and no pulsations ( gotthelf , petre & vasisht 1999 ) .",
    "we favor the isolated ns interpretation of cco because it has not displayed any variability .",
    "critical observations to elucidate its nature include searching for periodic and aperiodic variabilities , deep ir imaging , and longer  acis observations which would provide more source quanta for the spectral analysis .",
    "we are grateful to norbert schulz for providing the acis response matrices , to gordon garmire , leisa townsley and george chartas for their advices on the acis data reduction , and to niel brandt , sergei popov , and jeremy heyl for useful discussions .",
    "the  and  data were obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa s goddard space flight center . the work was partially supported through nasa grants nag5 - 6907 and nag5 - 7017 ."
