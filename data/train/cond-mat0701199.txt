    "the quest for superconductivity in layered structures has become the focus of intense research since the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 ( t@xmath6 k ) @xcite .",
    "the layered structure of mgb@xmath2 generates one of its most prominent features , namely the b 2@xmath7 orbitals form @xmath3-bands @xcite which are weakly dispersing along the @xmath8 direction and have a marked two dimensional character . in mgb@xmath2",
    "the @xmath9bands are hole doped , but the top of these bands is only @xmath10 ev higher than the fermi level .",
    "the @xmath9bands fermi surface sheets @xcite , two slightly warped cylinders with axis perpendicular to the boron layers , generate a huge electron - phonon coupling along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the carriers in the @xmath11bands , formed by the b 2@xmath12 orbitals , further enhance the average electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the formation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 states is typical of graphite - like structures composed by boron or carbon atoms . given the success of mgb@xmath2 it is natural to look for high @xmath5 superconductivity in structures having similar features .",
    "the problem is that , given the boron layers , small variations in the valence or mass of the intercalant or in the structural parameters are sufficient to considerably alter the @xmath3 or @xmath4 bands positions or the shape of their fermi surfaces and consequently destroy superconductivity . for one or some of these reasons alb@xmath2 , zrb@xmath2 , nbb@xmath2 , mob@xmath2 , yb@xmath2 , tab@xmath2 , tib@xmath2 , hfb@xmath2 , vb@xmath2 and crb@xmath2 are not superconducting @xcite .",
    "the hope of finding new superconducting materials in layered structures was recently increased by the discovery of superconductivity in the graphite intercalated compounds , ybc@xmath13 and cac@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is particularly promising since a huge number of intercalants are available for graphite @xcite . in cac@xmath13 , despite the layered structure and the existence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands originated from the carbon 2@xmath14 orbitals , the electronic structure close to the fermi level is completely different from that of mgb@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath4 bands , reminiscent of the graphite ones , and an intercalant free - electron - like band @xcite cross the fermi energy .",
    "the intercalant band forms a spherical fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling of cac@xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) is mainly due to coupling of the interlayer band with c vibrations perpendicular to the graphite layers and with ca vibrations .",
    "so , even though missing the @xmath3-bands , cac@xmath13 reaches an interesting 11.5 k @xmath5 .",
    "this temperature is substantially enhanced by pressure ( t@xmath16 k at @xmath17 gpa @xcite ) , contrary to what happens in mgb@xmath2 .",
    "as can be seen from the above examples , even if one restricts to sandwich structures formed by boron or carbon layers , the details of the electronic and phonon spectra and , subsequently , the critical temperature can change dramatically when the intercalant is included . as a consequence ,",
    "a theoretical approach is absolutely necessary to identify the most probable superconductors or at least to exclude the less probable ones .",
    "an attempt in this direction has been recently made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where by using _",
    "ab initio _ methods the authors studied the possible hole - doping of libc , a @xmath18 ev gap semiconductor .",
    "the authors suggested that a @xmath5 of the order of mgb@xmath2 could be reached if the insulating libc is substantially doped with holes to obtain li@xmath19bc .",
    "successive experimental studies have indicated that the structural response to the introduction of holes unfavorably modifies the electronic structure of li@xmath20bc , and so far no high @xmath5 superconductivity has been found in this system @xcite .    ideally designing new superconductors _ ab initio _ requires three steps .",
    "the first is the determination of the most stable structures given a set of atomic species .",
    "the second is the calculation of the electronic structure to verify that the given structure is at least metallic or can be made metallic easily .",
    "the third is the determination of the phonon dispersion and of the electron - phonon parameters .",
    "the first point is a daunting task even if one restricts one s search to a specific set of likely candidates@xcite .",
    "a systematic approach to tackle this problem has been recently offered in the way of data mining of _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite . in this method",
    "one uses the informations obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations of many different structures to build a database that can be then used to judge the stability of new structures .",
    "application of this method to intermetallics has led to the identification of new layered lithium monoboride phases which have a good chance to form under proper synthesis conditions @xcite .",
    "once a stable metallic structure is given , a calculation of the phonon spectra and of the electron - phonon coupling needs to be performed to obtain @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , while some qualitative information can be extracted from electronic - structure @xcite , for a quantitative analysis step three is absolutely necessary .    in this work",
    "we investigate the superconducting properties of the previously determined metal sandwich ( ms ) lithium monoboride @xcite by calculating its phonon spectrum and electron - phonon parameters .",
    "this system is metallic and , from qualitative arguments , one can infer that @xmath5 is of the same order of that of mgb@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "indeed this system has an electronic structure which is a hybrid between those of mgb@xmath2 and cac@xmath13 , since there are hole - doped @xmath9bands forming cylindrical fermi surfaces and there is an intercalant band crossing the fermi level .",
    "moreover the deformation potential is comparable to that of mgb@xmath2 @xcite . from this point of view , lib is a much more promising material than li@xmath19bc , because even without doping it has a significant density of @xmath3-states at the fermi level .    unfortunately , the full electron - phonon coupling calculations performed in this paper indicate that lib should have a @xmath5 in a 10 - 15 k range .",
    "we show that lib captures some of the important physics of mgb@xmath2 , namely the role of the @xmath9bands , but it lacks the contribution of the @xmath4 states to the electron - phonon coupling and it is only a far relative of cac@xmath13 because the interlayer band is very weakly coupled with the phonons . in an attempt to improve the situation we examine what role the hydrostatic pressure and doping can play in determining the critical temperature .",
    "in all our calculations of the layered lithium monoboride we have used the ms1 theoretical crystal structure basing our choice on the following considerations . on the one hand , it has the smallest unit cell of all ms structures , which offers computational efficiency . on the other hand , even though other stacking sequences are possible ( e.g. ms2 , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , ms1 is a good representative model of the layered lithium monoboride because the long - period shifts are expected to have little effect on its superconducting properties @xcite .",
    "ms1-lib has a rhombohedral unit cell with r3 m space group .",
    "there are four atoms in the primitive unit cell with wyckoff positions li@xmath21 , li@xmath22 , b@xmath23 and b@xmath24 .",
    "the fully relaxed parameters are @xmath25  , @xmath26 .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations are performed using the quantum espresso code @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "we use norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite with configuration @xmath27 and non - linear core correction @xcite for li , and configuration @xmath28 for b. the wavefunctions are expanded using a 50 ry cutoff .",
    "the dynamical matrices and the electron - phonon coupling are calculated using density functional perturbation theory in the linear response @xcite . for the electronic integration in the phonon calculation",
    "we use an @xmath29 uniform @xmath30-point mesh and hermite - gaussian smearing from 0.05 ry . for the evaluation of the electron - phonon coupling we use",
    "an @xmath31 monkhorst - pack mesh . for the @xmath32 average over the phonon momentum * q * we use an @xmath33 @xmath34point mesh .",
    "the phonon dispersion is obtained by fourier interpolation of the dynamical matrices computed on the @xmath35 mesh .    the pressure- and doping - induced changes in the electronic properties of lib are studied with vienna ab initio simulation package vasp @xcite within the gga @xcite .",
    "we use projector augmented waves ( paw )  @xcite pseudopotentials , in which li semi - core states are treated as valence ; the energy cutoff is set at 30 ryd .",
    "the projected electronic density of states ( edos ) is found by decomposition of the wavefunction within a sphere of the default paw radius of 1.7 a.u .",
    "for the ms1 unit cell , the @xmath36-ms1 and @xmath37-ms2 supercells we use @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 monkhorst - pack * k*-meshes , respectively .",
    "the band structure of li@xmath41b@xmath41 is presented in fig . [",
    "fig : bands ] ( see footnote @xcite for high - symmetry points notation ) . similarly to what happens in mgb@xmath2 @xcite , there are two boron @xmath3-bands crossing the fermi energy @xmath42 . compared to the @xmath3-bands in mgb@xmath2 , these bands are even more two - dimensional ( due to the larger interlayer distance ) and shifted by more than 0.6 ev to higher energies at the @xmath43 point . as in mgb@xmath2 , they generate two cylindrical fermi surfaces ( in our case with axes along the @xmath44 direction , fig . [ fig : fs ] ) .",
    "the boron @xmath4 states in lib resemble more the @xmath4 states of graphite , as they cross exactly at @xmath42 , so that lib is lacking @xmath4 fermi surfaces altogether . in mgb@xmath2",
    "these states cross at about 2 ev above @xmath42 , which leads to the appearance of an extended @xmath4 fermi surface @xcite .",
    "another important difference between the electronic structures of the two borides is the presence of a lithium band at @xmath42 in lib .",
    "the position of this band resembles the intercalant band in cac@xmath13 @xcite , although in lib it has substantial hybridization to boron states close to the @xmath45-point . the corresponding fermi surface ( a compressed sphere )",

    "[ fig : phonon_dispersion ] .",
    "the phonon modes at the @xmath43-point are decomposed as @xmath50@xcite . to distinguish between modes with the same symmetry but different eigenvectors we use the following notation : @xmath51 @xmath52 $ ]",

    "for convenience , we label phonon branches everywhere in the brillouin zone using the name of their representation at @xmath43 .    except for acoustic modes , a clear separation exists between optical li and b vibrations .",
    "li modes are confined in the 40 - 55 mev region and are not dispersive , meaning that li - vibrations behave essentially as einstein modes .",
    "boron in - plane vibrations are softened along the @xmath44 direction due to coupling to the @xmath3 bands .",
    "the softening at @xmath43 of the @xmath67 phonon branches is approximately 20 mev , to be compared with the almost 40 mev in mgb@xmath2 for the @xmath68 modes @xcite .",
    "this suggests a strong coupling of the @xmath3 bands to the in - plane vibrations in lib @xcite , but not as strong as in the case of mgb@xmath2 .",
    "the three acoustic modes along the @xmath44 direction are substantially softer with respect to the other directions . at the zone border ,",
    "@xmath45 , these modes are formed by ( i ) in - plane ( li+b)@xmath48 vibrations at energies @xmath69 mev and ( ii ) out - of - plane ( li+b)@xmath70 vibrations at @xmath71 mev .",
    "they can be related to the soft modes at the @xmath43 point in ms2-lib , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the superconducting properties can be understood calculating the electron - phonon coupling @xmath72 for a phonon mode @xmath73 with momentum @xmath74 : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the amplitude of the displacement of the phonon , @xmath77 is the kohn - sham potential and @xmath78 is the electronic density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the calculated average electron - phonon coupling is @xmath79 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the previously defined @xmath30-space and @xmath74-space mesh dimensions , respectively ) .",
    "the eliashberg function @xmath82 and the integral @xmath83 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha2fdos ] .",
    "as can be seen most of the contribution comes from phonon states in the 60 - 90 mev region and a smaller contribution comes from low energy states .",
    "an estimate of the different contributions of the in - plane ( li@xmath48 and b@xmath48 ) and out - of - plane ( li@xmath70 and b@xmath70 ) vibrations to @xmath32 can be obtained from the relation @xmath84_{i\\alpha , j\\beta } [ { \\bf c_q}^{-1}]_{j\\beta , i\\alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 indices indicate the displacement of the @xmath86 atom in the cartesian direction @xmath87 , @xmath88_{i\\alpha , j\\beta}=\\sum_{{\\bf k},n , m}4 { \\tilde g}_{i\\alpha}^{*}{\\tilde g}_{j\\beta } \\delta(\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}n } ) \\delta(\\epsilon_{{\\bf k+q}m})/[n(0 ) n_{k}]$ ] , and @xmath89    the off - diagonal terms are small ( but not negligible ) compared to the total @xmath32 .",
    "most of the coupling is to the in - plane b vibration ; contributions from the li and the out - of - plane b vibrations are smaller . since the @xmath3-bands do not couple to the b@xmath70 vibrations and",
    "since there are no @xmath4 fermi surfaces , the coupling to b@xmath70 vibrations is due to the intercalant band .",
    "note that the decomposed values of @xmath32 contain contributions from different modes and are summed over all the @xmath74-points in the brillouin zone .",
    "for example , @xmath90 includes the coupling to the in - plane @xmath67 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 branches . by examining the integrated eliashberg function @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha2fdos](c ) and the phonon characters in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonon_dispersion ] one can infer that the @xmath67 branch is the most important of the three : among them it has the highest phdos in the 70 - 100 mev range , in which @xmath32 gains most of its total value .",
    "the soft in - plane @xmath92 branch is far less important , as the net contribution from all the soft modes having energy under 20 mev is only @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha2fdos](c ) )",
    ".    it is instructive to compare our result with other layered superconductors . in mgb@xmath2",
    "the coupling of the @xmath3-bands to the phonon modes is @xmath95 @xcite , while in lib the corresponding value is less than 0.46 , as discussed above .",
    "this difference can be clarified by noting that the @xmath68 phonon linewidth @xmath96 along @xmath97 in mgb@xmath2 happens to be comparable in magnitude with that of the @xmath67 mode along @xmath44 in lib .",
    "therefore , the reduced electron - phonon coupling in lib is mainly due to the @xmath67 phonon frequency being harder than the @xmath68 one in mgb@xmath2 ( @xmath98 at @xmath43 ) .",
    "this unfortunate result can be linked to the absence of the @xmath4 carriers , which play an important role in softening of the @xmath68 mode in mgb@xmath2@xcite .",
    "we find that lib and graphite intercalated compounds have few similarities in terms of superconducting features .",
    "in particular , in cac@xmath13 the intercalant modes are responsible of @xmath99 of the total electron - phonon coupling , and the rest comes from vibrations of carbon modes in the direction perpendicular to the graphite layers . in cac@xmath13",
    "one has @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xcite . in lib",
    "the overall contribution of b@xmath70 , li@xmath48 and li@xmath49 vibrations is less than half of that of cac@xmath13 , which means that while lib captures some of the physics of mgb@xmath2 , it does not capture the physics of graphite intercalated compounds to full extent .",
    "this is also clear from the phonon spectrum of cac@xmath13 where the intercalant modes are at energies lower than 20 mev and one of the ca modes undergoes a marked softening with a corresponding large electron - phonon coupling ( at point @xmath102 of fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in lib , on the contrary",
    ", the li modes are much higher in energies ( @xmath103 mev ) mev and dispersionless .",
    "the main reason for this difference comes from the mass of li which is 5.77 times smaller than that of ca leading to frequencies which are on average 2.4 times larger .",
    "the critical superconducting temperature is estimated using the mcmillan formula @xcite : @xmath104 \\label{eq : mcmillan}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the screened coulomb pseudopotential and @xmath106 the phonon frequencies logarithmic average .",
    "we obtain @xmath107 mev leading to @xmath5 of approximately 10 - 15 k for @xmath108 .",
    "this value could be further enhanced by multiband effects .",
    "even though a theoretically - devised from scratch superconductor with @xmath109 k could be considered a success of the materials prediction methodology , the stoichiometric lib compound falls short of expectations to compete with the record - holding binary mgb@xmath2 . in this section",
    "we investigate whether it is possible to favorably modify the electronic properties of lib and achieve higher @xmath5 by doping or applying pressure .",
    "we pay special attention to the evolution of the @xmath4 states , since their reintroduction at @xmath42 may soften the @xmath67 mode and lead to a larger coupling .    as has been pointed out previously @xcite , the bonding @xmath4 states are completely filled under ambient conditions . because the band crossing in lib at the fermi level is accidental , it may be possible to move the crossing point with pressure and increase the @xmath4-bands edos at @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig : edospdelta](a ) reveals that there is indeed a rapid change in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 edos , followed by a plateau after 5 gpa .",
    "this behavior is a reflection of two distinctly different regimes of the lib structural changes : i ) in the 0 - 5-gpa pressure range the li - li interlayer spacing quickly shrinks and the b - b bond length slightly expands so that at 5 gpa they become about 0.5 and 1.02 of their zero - pressure values , respectively ; ii ) for pressures above 5 gpa the li atoms in the bilayer start experiencing the hard - core repulsion and the compound compresses more isotropically .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : edospdelta](a ) illustrates that by reducing the li - li interlayer distance one forces the charge from the intercalant band ( completely emptied at about 6 gpa ) into the boron @xmath4 and @xmath3 states ( lowered by 0.7 ev at that pressure ) .",
    "once the charge redistribution is complete , no appreciable changes in the edos are seen for the boron states up to at least 30 gpa .",
    "therefore , the peculiar behavior of the nearly free electron intercalant states ( also observed in other systems @xcite ) is the only meaningful factor allowing modification of the lib boron states with pressure .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that the compression of lib does not lead to the desired @xmath4-bands edos values comparable to those in mgb@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the hydrostatic pressure causes such a quick drop in the @xmath3-bands edos that this will likely negate any possible enhancement in the electron - phonon coupling due to the reintroduction of the @xmath4-states at @xmath42 .",
    "the phonon modes are also expected to harden under pressure , further reducing the electron - phonon coupling in lib @xcite .",
    "and @xmath4 states as a function of pressure ; b ) the same as a function of doping level : the hollow points represent charged lib unit cell in a neutralizing background ; the solid points correspond to substitutional mg and al doping of lib in the ms1 and ms2 superstructures described in the text @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 edos in mgb@xmath2 are 0.098 and 0.064 states/(ev@xmath110spin@xmath110f.u . ) , respectively .",
    "the inset shows pressure - induced changes in the position of different states near the fermi level : @xmath3-boron and intercalant ( labeled @xmath111 ) states at the @xmath43 point and crossing of the @xmath4-@xmath112 states along the @xmath113 direction.,width=359 ]    lib has plenty of available bonding @xmath3 states , therefore the compound should be easy to electron - dope . a quick examination of the boron edos states around the fermi level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] or fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) gives an idea on what possible changes in the fermi surfaces and , eventually , in the electron - phonon coupling the doping could lead to . at small doping levels ,",
    "when the rigid band approximation normally holds , the edos from the two dimensional @xmath3 bands should only slightly fluctuate until the states are completely filled , which happens at @xmath114n(0)@xmath115 ( e / ev ) ( 1 ev ) = 0.70 e / f.u .",
    "= 0.35 e / boron .",
    "the edos from the @xmath4 bands grows slowly and even at the relatively high electron - doping of 0.35 e / boron it would amount only to about a half of what is observed in mgb@xmath2 .",
    "another way to tweak the electronic structure could be to hole - dope lib as it is done for li@xmath20bc @xcite . the known limitations of this approach are the buckling of the hexagonal layers and the eventual destabilization of the compound upon heavy li depletion @xcite .",
    "we first simulate the electron- ( hole- ) doping using a charged cell with a neutralizing positive ( negative ) background . normally , in this approach one can safely relax the unit cell parameters and obtain valuable information about the bond length variation under small doping",
    ". however , in the case of the electron - doped lib the repulsion between the negatively charged boron layers overcomes the weak binding between the lithium layers , causing the @xmath116-axis to undergo unphysical expansion even at small levels of doping .",
    "therefore , we fix the @xmath116-axis at the zero - doping value and relax only the remaining three parameters .",
    "the set of data , shown as hollow points in fig .",
    "[ fig : edospdelta](b ) , supports our earlier conclusion that the @xmath4-band edos can not be easily increased .",
    "note that the approximations used in this test , i.e. the fixed @xmath116-axis and the use of a neutralizing background , may influence the results to some extent .",
    "for example , the positive electrostatic potential from ionized dopants could bring the delocalized @xmath4-states down ( in addition to the rigid band downshift ) and could potentially be an important factor in increasing the @xmath4 edos .    to address these limitations we use a more realistic model of the electron - doped lib by substituting li with mg or al .",
    "small doping levels are obtained only for large unit cells ; we use the hexagonal @xmath117-ms1 and @xmath37-ms2 supercells with 48 and 32 atoms , respectively .",
    "replacement of one or two li atoms in these structures results in the 1/24 , 1/16 , 1/12 , and 1/8 concentrations of dopants per boron , and the level of doping is found in the assumption that they give up all their valence charge . in all the cases",
    "the @xmath116-axis expansion in the fully relaxed unit cells does not exceed 6% .",
    "the resulting averaged boron edos for the mg and al sets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edospdelta](b ) as solid points @xcite .",
    "the scattered presence of dopants in the lattice should cause some dispersion of the local boron properties .",
    "a general trend observed in our supercell calculations is that a downshift of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 states happens only for b layers in direct contact with the dopant .",
    "typical values of the downshift that a single mg ( al ) atom induces in all eight atoms in a neighboring b layer are about 0.2 ( 0.5 ) ev .",
    "it is not easy to isolate the importance of different factors defining the level of b doping , i.e. the simple charge transfer , the electrostatic effect discussed above and the structural changes ( expansion of the @xmath116-axis and contraction of the b - b bond ) .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : edospdelta](b ) demonstrates that the net effect of the substitutional doping is described reasonably well within the rigid band model .    in summary ,",
    "our tests indicate that it is rather difficult to reintroduce a significant amount of @xmath4 states at @xmath42 with hydrostatic pressure or small doping , because the band crossing in lib happens to be exactly at @xmath42 , about 2 ev lower than in mgb@xmath2 . to have a chance of substantially increasing @xmath5 , one should search for more radical ways of modifying the electronic structure of the ms metal borides .",
    "in this work we have investigated electron and phonon properties of the recently theoretically - devised superconductor lib @xcite . by studying in details the phonon properties of this hypothetical material we have found that its critical temperature is of the order of 10 - 15 k. superconductivity is mainly of the mgb@xmath2 kind with planar @xmath46 bands strongly coupled with phonons . differently from mgb@xmath2",
    ", lib has no fermi surface generated by @xmath4 states but an additional intercalant one .",
    "thus , its electronic structure can be seen as a hybrid between mgb@xmath2 and cac@xmath13 .",
    "however , the intercalant electronic states of lib are weakly coupled with the li and b@xmath70 vibrations so that the overall electron - phonon coupling is only @xmath0 .    since the discovery of mgb@xmath2 , no other diborides have been found with high @xmath5 ( for a full list , see ref .",
    "if we compare lib with the known diborides , our calculated 10 - 15 k critical temperature is not so low , although it is far from the 39 k of mgb@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the study of lib gives an important understanding .",
    "the common belief is that the main effect for the singular and unique behavior of mgb@xmath2 is given by the presence of almost two - dimensional @xmath3 bands .",
    "lib has even more planar @xmath3 bands and even higher @xmath3 edos at @xmath42 relative to that in mgb@xmath2 @xcite ; however , their contribution to the total electron - phonon coupling turns out to be at least 25% smaller .",
    "this reduction can be attributed to the differences between the in - plane boron vibrations in the two borides , caused mainly by the lack of the @xmath4 carriers at @xmath42 in lib .",
    "namely , the softening of the @xmath67 mode in lib is substantially smaller ( by about a factor of two ) than that of @xmath68 in mgb@xmath2 , which makes the former mode be noticeably harder ( @xmath98 at @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , in addition to the direct loss of the @xmath4 states contribution to @xmath32 , their absence at @xmath42 in lib also has a strong indirect negative effect on the overall electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we have investigated whether this somewhat unexpected obstacle , preventing lib to be a truly high @xmath5 superconductor , could be overcome with moderate modifications of the compound s properties .",
    "behavior of electronic features important for the lib superconductivity has been examined as a function of small doping and pressure .",
    "our results indicate that the @xmath4 edos increases very slowly and can not reach the desired values , at least not before the @xmath3 edos is substantially reduced .",
    "thus , small doping and pressure are not expected to significantly improve @xmath5 in lib .",
    "a promising direction to fix the problem would be to find a suitable lib - based ternary alloy ; this question is currently under investigation .",
    "theoretical development of potentially important superconducting materials is a difficult task because @xmath5 critically depends on their band structure features and vibrational properties .",

    "the case of lib shows that it is possible to theoretically predict a compound that both i ) has a good chance to form and ii ) possesses interesting superconducting properties .",
    "study of such promising candidates gives important insights into how to perform a more targeted search for novel superconducting materials .    while we were finishing writing this paper , a preprint on the related structure ms2-lib appeared on - line @xcite .",
    "the results of the paper are similar to ours except for some numerical details that can probably be related to the different unit cells and * k*,*q*-point samplings used@xcite . however , our conclusions concerning the possibility of increasing the @xmath5 in lib by doping are rather different , as explained in the previous section .",
    "we acknowledge many fruitful discussions with igor mazin , francesco mauri , michele lazzeri , and roxana margine .",
    "calculations were performed at the san diego supercomputing center and at idris supercomputing center ( project 061202 ) .",

    "for example , the long - period shifts have little effect on the ms - lib energy : ms1 and ms2 have been demonstrated to be nearly degenerate under ambient conditions , so that the synthesized lithium monoboride could be a mixture of the two crystal structure phases @xcite .",
