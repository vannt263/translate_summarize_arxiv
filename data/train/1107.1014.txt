    "it is interesting to know when a map attaining this infimum exists ; sufficient conditions for this were found by gangbo @xcite and by levin @xcite , extending work of a number of authors described in @xcite @xcite .",

    "sufficient conditions for this were discovered by ma , trudinger and wang @xcite and trudinger and wang @xcite @xcite , after results for the special case @xmath31 had been worked out by brenier @xcite , delane @xcite , caffarelli @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , and urbas @xcite , and for the cost @xmath32 and measures supported on the unit sphere by wang  @xcite . if the ratio @xmath33  although bounded away from zero and infinity",
    " is not continuous , the map @xmath27 will not generally be differentiable , though one may still hope for it to be continuous .",
    "this question is not merely of technical interest , since discontinuities in @xmath13 arise unavoidably in applications such as partial transport problems @xcite",

    "as remarked in @xcite , for graphs which fail to be strongly convex and all riemannian product geometries , the stronger condition * ( a3 ) *  necessarily fails . in a sequel",
    ", we apply the techniques developed here to deduce regularity of optimal maps for the multiple products of round spheres @xcite .",
    "moreover , theorem  [ t : hoelder ] allows one to apply the higher interior regularity results established by liu , trudinger and wang @xcite , ensuring in particular that the transport map is @xmath36-smooth if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are .",
    "+   most of the regularity results quoted above derive from one of two approaches .",
    "the continuity method , used by delano , urbas , ma , trudinger and wang , is a time - honored technique for solving nonlinear equations .",
    "here one perturbs a manifestly soluble problem ( such as @xmath39 with @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 ) to the problem of interest ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) along a family @xmath44 designed to ensure the set of @xmath45 $ ] for which it is soluble is both open and closed .",
    "openness follows from linearization and non - degenerate ellipticity using an implicit function theorem . for the non - degenerate ellipticity and closedness",
    ", it is required to establish estimates on the size of derivatives of the solutions ( assuming such solutions exist ) which depend only on information known a priori about the data @xmath46 . in this way one obtains smoothness of the solution @xmath47 from the same argument which shows @xmath48 to exist .",
    "the alternative approach relies on first knowing existence and uniqueness of a borel map which solves the problem in great generality , and then deducing continuity or smoothness by close examination of this map after imposing additional conditions on the data @xmath49 .",
    "although precursors can be traced back to alexandrov @xcite , in the present context this method was largely developed and refined by caffarelli @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite , who used convexity of @xmath29 crucially to localize the map @xmath50 and renormalize its behaviour near a point @xmath51 of interest in the borderline case @xmath52 . for non - borderline",
    "* ( a3 ) *  costs , simpler estimates suffice to deduce continuity of @xmath27 , as in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ; in this case loeper was actually able to deduce an explicit bound @xmath53 on the hlder exponent of @xmath27 when @xmath54 .",
    "this bound was recently improved to its sharp value @xmath55 by liu @xcite , using a key observation discovered independently from us ( see section  [ s : transform ] and theorem  [ thm : apparently convex ] ) ; both loeper and liu also obtained explicit exponents @xmath56 for @xmath57 with @xmath58 @xcite or @xmath59 @xcite and @xmath60 . for the classical case @xmath52 ,",
    "explicit bounds were found by forzani and maldonado @xcite , depending on @xmath61 @xcite @xcite .",
    "+ our proof introduces at least three significant new tools .",
    "its starting point is that condition * ( a3)*@xmath9  allows one to add a null lagrangian term to the cost function and exploit diffeomorphism ( i.e.  gauge ) invariance to choose coordinates , which depend on the point of interest , to transform the @xmath7-convex functions to level - set convex functions ( see theorem  [ thm : apparently convex ] ) ; this observation was made also by liu @xcite , independently from us .",
    "next we establish alexandrov type estimates ( theorems  [ thm : lower alex ] and [ thm : estimate ] ) for @xmath7-convex functions whose level sets are convex , extending classical estimates for convex functions .",
    "these rely on quantitative new aspects of the geometry of convex sets that we derive elsewhere , and which may have independent interest @xcite .",
    "the resulting alexandrov type estimates enable us to exploit caffarelli s approach @xcite @xcite @xcite more systematically than liu @xcite was able to do , to prove continuity and injectivity ( see theorems  [ t : strict convex ] and [ t : continuity ] ) .",
    "once such results are established , the same estimates permit us to exploit forzani and maldonado s @xcite approach to extend the engulfing property of gutierrez and huang @xcite to * ( a3)*@xmath9  @xmath7-convex functions ( see theorem  [ t : engulfing ] ) , improving mere continuity of optimal maps to hlder continuity ( theorem  [ t : c1alpha ] and its corollary  [ c : universal holder exponent ] ) . along the way",
    ", we also have to overcome another serious difficulty , namely the fact that the domain of the cost function ( where it is smooth and satisfies appropriate cross - curvature conditions ) may not be the whole of @xmath18 .",
    "( this situation arises , for example , when optimal transportation occurs between domains in riemannian manifolds for the distance squared cost or similar type .",
    ") this is handled by using theorem  [ thm : bdry - inter ] , where it is first established that optimal transport does not send interior points to boundary points , and vice versa , under the strong @xmath7-convexity hypothesis * ( b2)@xmath62 *  described in the next section . theorem  [ thm : bdry - inter ] does not require * ( a3)*@xmath9 , however .",
    "let us point out that , in two dimensions , there is an alternate approach to establishing continuity of optimal maps ; it was carried out by figalli and loeper @xcite following alexandrov s strategy @xcite , but their result relies on our theorem  [ thm : bdry - inter ] .",
    "let us begin by formulating the relevant hypothesis on the cost function @xmath2 in a slightly different format than ma , trudinger and wang @xcite @xcite .",
