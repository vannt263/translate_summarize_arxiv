    "<S> management of matter waves in optical lattices ( ols ) can be implemented in different ways , including variation of parameters of the periodic potential in time or change of the nonlinearity with help of the feshbach resonance . in particular , by changing the amplitude of the lattice one can achieve the delocalizing transition , which consists in transformation of an initially localized mode , also referred to as a gap soliton , into a spreading out atomic wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition was predicted for two- and three - dimensional single - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite and can be observed by adiabatically decreasing the amplitude of the periodic potential below some value , with subsequent restoration of the initial lattice profile . </S>",
    "<S> if the amplitude of the lattice reaches some critical value , the initially localized wave packet can not be recovered at the end of the experiment and one observes a spreading out condensate . in a recent paper  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the delocalizing transition can be observed also in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , with help of interplay between linear and nonlinear lattices . </S>",
    "<S> this suggestion was based on the fact that the transition occurs in a system where small amplitude gap solitons can not exist  @xcite , i.e. where a minimal atomic number is necessary for the creation of a localized mode . from the physical point of view , </S>",
    "<S> the transition is related to modulational stability of the bloch states bordering either the semi - infinite gap in the spectrum of bogoliubov phonons or a gap induced by the periodic potential  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the described results naturally rise questions : whether other 1d systems allowing for delocalizing transition exist ? and </S>",
    "<S> whether other physical mechanisms resulting in delocalizing transition exist ? </S>",
    "<S> a simple positive answer to the first question readily follows from the fact that the quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation with a periodic potential requires a critical number of particles for the creation of a gap soliton  @xcite , and thus can undergo the delocalizing transition . </S>",
    "<S> the answer to the second question is also positive , and moreover it offers another 1d system allowing for a new type of delocalizing transition . to explain this </S>",
    "<S> , we recall that new factors affecting the existence of gap solitons appear when one considers multicomponent systems in periodic potentials , and , in particular , binary mixtures or spinor condensates loaded in ols : a necessary condition for existence of the modes is that the chemical potentials of both components must belong to the respective phonon gaps  @xcite . this condition may be violated being subjected to change of the system parameters , thus leading to destruction of two - component gap solitons . generally speaking , in such a situation one does not necessarily expect complete delocalization of the condensate , because one of the chemical potentials may still belong to a gap , while the other one reaches the gap edge . instead , </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , one may observe a _ </S>",
    "<S> partial delocalizing transition _ , where one of the components spreads out , while the other one stays localized . </S>",
    "<S> detailed description of this phenomenon constitutes the main goal of the present communication .    before going into details , we mention other aspects of the formulated problem . </S>",
    "<S> first , transformation between two different states of a condensate represents not only fundamental but also practical interest , as it allows for selective and thus controllable separation of the initially localized components of mixtures of becs . </S>",
    "<S> its mathematical relevance is determined by the fact that the transition allows for experimental study of the limits of the existence of localized states .    </S>",
    "<S> second , on the basis of preceding studies , the most direct approach to obtain the delocalizing transition would be the change of the parameters of the ol . </S>",
    "<S> however ( this was checked by our extensive numerical simulations ) , the response of a binary mixture to such change is very similar to the one displayed by one - component becs , and does not lead to the delocalizing transition . in particular , decreasing ( increasing ) of the potential results in expansion ( narrowing ) of vector gap solitons ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . essentially new phenomena can be found when management is performed by means of changing the interspecies interactions ( for one - component becs , the delocalizing transition induced by nonlinear management was suggested in  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> third , it was also verified numerically that the delocalizing transition reveals qualitatively the same behavior for binary mixtures of two different species of atoms and for spinor condensates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the present work we concentrate on the more simple dynamics of a spinor condensate induced by change of the interspecies interaction .    finally , since adiabatic change of the parameters in practice represents a particular type of management of mixtures of becs , it is relevant to mention that , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was shown that interplay between the ol potential and the scattering length can assist building two - component gap solitons .    [ [ the - model - and - numerical - method . ] ] the model and numerical method . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , in the chosen units , the effective number of particles of component @xmath3 is calculated as @xmath4 and is related to the real number of atoms , @xmath5 , by the formula @xmath6 , where @xmath7 in the real experimental situation . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ gp ] ) play a prominent role . </S>",
    "<S> we thus make an ansatz @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the chemical potential of the @xmath14 component , and substituting in ( [ gp ] ) we obtain ( @xmath2 ) @xmath15    a diversity of localized modes supported by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we focus only on the particular case of symmetric ( even ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to simplify the construction of the initial states ( we do this by the shooting method ) , as well as for their systematic exploration , we restrict the consideration to the case where @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 . in this case , the simplest initial profile of a localized mode is characterized by equal chemical potentials @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> we will also fix @xmath28 , which does not affect qualitatively the phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> as we investigate the behavior of localized modes subjected to the adiabatic variation of @xmath10 , we first employ a newton - raphson ( nr ) method for constructing the branches of solutions , which  depart \" from the given @xmath29 and are constrained to fixed values of @xmath30 . when the strength of the interspecies interactions is changed , the chemical potentials of both components are changed as well , i.e. @xmath31 , provided that @xmath32 , and can be computed using the formula ( @xmath2 ) @xmath33    this formula is also used to calculate  instant \" chemical potentials in the temporal adiabatic dynamics , when @xmath11 , which is studied using the procedure as follows . for a given @xmath17 , we start with the solutions @xmath20 obtained from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we start with the existence of the stationary fundamental vector soliton for different @xmath10 , using the nr method , as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potentials @xmath50 are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ newt_ccj_positivo ] ( the left top panel ) , where one can observe two important features .    first , even infinitesimal change of @xmath51 results in splitting of the chemical potentials : @xmath52 with @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the chemical potential of the second component monotonously grows with @xmath10 approaching the top of the first energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> the latter suggests that , at some @xmath54 between points b and c ( see the left top panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ newt_ccj_positivo ] ) , @xmath55 collapases with the gap edge . for @xmath56 , the vector soliton with given numbers of particles in each component does not exist and thus , according to the arguments exposed above , @xmath57 must determine the critical value above which the delocalizing transition occurs . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can predict that this is a partial delocalization because the chemical potential of the first component still belongs to the gap and thus the respective component persists .    </S>",
    "<S> although we use a rather large spatial domain of calculation @xmath58 , @xmath59 $ ] , the provided analysis of the stationary solutions is not yet conclusive about the existence of the modes , because of boundaries possibly affecting the expanding second component . indeed , from the profiles of @xmath29 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ newt_ccj_positivo ] , one observes tendency of the second component to the bloch state of the upper band edge as @xmath10 exceeds @xmath57 . to check numerically whether the delocalization is authentic , i.e. that the second component does not represent , say , a small amplitude gap soliton , affected by the boundaries , we recall that @xmath60 becomes small enough when @xmath10 tends to @xmath57 . hence the first component approximately solves eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ newt_ccj_positivo ] , one observes complete restoring of the vector soliton if @xmath10 does not reach its critical value , which is found to be @xmath65 , while partial delocalization of the binary mode is observed when @xmath66 ( as predicted by the stationary analysis ) .    additionally , we explored the case with all attractive interactions ( @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> symmetric solutions are now located in the semi - infinite gap and , as @xmath10 is adiabatically increased , the chemical potentials of both components grow , approaching the gap edge . </S>",
    "<S> however , we did not observe the delocalizing transition for negative values of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it occurred only for @xmath68 , i.e. when @xmath69 becomes negative . </S>",

    "<S> for different values of @xmath37 below the bifurcation point , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 , we found that the vector soliton can be restored to its initial shape , as shown in [ din_w-025c008][(b),(c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath10 overcomes the critical value @xmath81 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ [ din_w-025c008](d ) , ( e ) ] ) , one component ( here @xmath86 ) breaks into two repelling wave packets moving outwards the center , while the other component ( here @xmath87 ) transforms into a stable single - component localized mode . </S>",
    "<S> the observed behavior can also be interpreted as a kind of delocalizing transition . its physical origin and , </S>",
    "<S> naturally , its manifestation are different from the ones reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ newt_w-025 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> additionally , instability of the vector soliton was observed for several values of @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> all such values are located in a region of the branch @xmath89 between its inflection point and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this behavior to the existence of domains of instability along the branch @xmath89 . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ct ] ) , we have that the velocity of @xmath38 at the point @xmath37 is zero ( @xmath90 ) , therefore a mode spends long enough time in the vicinity of @xmath37 for the instability to develop . </S>",
    "<S> this is what happens in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ din_w-025c008][(f ) , ( g ) ] , where one of the components of the vector soliton ( here @xmath86 ) looses its stability , breaks from the second component and starts to move away from the center , while the second component maintains its shape . in the case </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath91 , presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ din_w-025c008][(d ) , ( e ) ] , although we pass in the instability region , we do not observe instability . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by that fact that the time spent by the vector soliton in the instability region was not enough for instability to start developing .    </S>",

    "<S> when all nonlinear interactions are repulsive , one of the components can be delocalized if subjected to a sufficiently large change of the interspecies scattering length , as its chemical potential collapses with the energy band edge , while the other component remains localized . on the other hand , </S>",
