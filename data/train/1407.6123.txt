    "the discovery of a higgs boson @xcite by the atlas@xcite and cms@xcite collaborations at the lhc marks a milestone of an effort that has been ongoing for almost half a century and opens up a new era of particle physics .",
    "the existing measurements @xcite and the global fits to the atlas and cms higgs data within remarkable precision@xcite agree with the standard model ( sm ) predictions .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the atlas and cms null results in searches for any new physics .",
    "however , the experiments of cold dark matter@xcite and neutrino oscillations@xcite can not be explained in the framework of the sm so that they are supposed to provide obvious evidence for the new physics beyond the sm . in particular , the facts that the sm can be an effective theory valid all the way up to the planck scale and there is no symmetry protecting the scalar masses lead to the naturalness problem ,",
    "i.e. , why the higgs boson mass is of the order of the electroweak scale and not driven by the radiative corrections to the planck scale , remains unanswered .    since the discovery of the higgs boson the fine - tuning problem has become even more intriguing . among many new physics models , little higgs models based on a collective symmetry breaking",
    "can provide a natural explanation of the fine - tuning by constructing the higgs as a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "the littlest higgs ( lh ) model@xcite is an economical approach to implement the idea of the little higgs theory .",
    "however , due to the large corrections to the electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) from the mixing of the sm gauge bosons and the heavy gauge bosons , the original lh model is severely constrained by precision electroweak data .",
    "this constraint can be relaxed by introducing the discrete symmetry t - parity , which is dubbed as littlest higgs model with t - parity(lht)@xcite .    with current data , all properties of the observed",
    "higgs - like particle turn out to be in rough agreement with expectations of the sm@xcite , but there are still some rooms for the new physics @xcite , which may be ultimately examined at the lhc - run2 and the future higgs factories @xcite . since top partner is naturally related to the higgs physics and plays an important role in the naturalness problem , one can obtain constraints from the higgs data@xcite . in this work , we will discuss the higgs couplings and the naturalness problem in the lht model at the lhc and triple - large electron - positron collider ( tlep)@xcite by performing a global fit of the latest higgs data , @xmath0 and oblique parameters , and give the current and future constraints to the lht parameters .",
    "recently , some similar works have been carried out in ref.@xcite .",
    "different from these papers , we perform a state - of - the - art global fit to obtain the indirect constraints on the breaking scale and the top partner with a comprehensive way .",
    "this method was widely used in the fit of the sm to the electroweak precision data .",
    "so , it will be also meaningful to explore what might happen in the lht model with a global fit at future colliders . by building an overall likelihood function for the constraints from the ewpo , @xmath0 measurements and higgs data ,",
    "we can obtain a well - defined statistical results of the exclusion limit on the breaking scale .",
    "more importantly , we obtain the exclusion limit on the top partner mass , which is obvious absent in other papers .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "the mass of @xmath27 can be given by @xmath34 where all components of the triplet are degenerate at the order we are examining .",
    "when t - parity is implemented in the quark sector of the model , we require the existence of mirror partners with t - odd quantum number for each sm quark .",

    "in contrast to @xmath41 , the t - odd top partner @xmath42 does not contribute to s , t , u parameters since it is an @xmath78 singlet which does not mix with the sm top quark .",
    "secondly , the t - odd mirror fermions give a contribution to the t parameter at one - loop , which can have a noticeable effect on the ewpo due to a large number ( twelve ) of doublets in the sm ; thirdly , another important correction to both the s and t parameters follows from the modified couplings of the higgs boson to the sm gauge bosons .",

    "furthermore , we can see that the deviations for case a are less than that for case b , which originate from the stronger suppression for the down - type fermion couplings to the higgs boson in case b.    furthermore , we can see that all changes of the higgs couplings are negative . in the lht model , in order to cancel the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass , the heavy gauge bosons and the additional heavy quark @xmath41 are introduced .",
    "this leads to negative modification of the relevant couplings with respect to the sm .",
