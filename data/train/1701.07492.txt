    "each path in a digraph @xmath0 corresponds to a word over the alphabet @xmath1 . given a subset @xmath2 ,",
    "consider the map @xmath3 that deletes elements of @xmath4 from such words .",
    "the question naturally arises : does the image of @xmath3 correspond to the set of paths in some other digraph ?    in this paper , we address this and related questions .",
    "the practical motivation is that we have a complicated structure such as a digraph representing the possible flow of some some quantity through a system , and we wish to abstract away irrelevant details while efficiently preserving paths in the structure .",
    "for example , we might consider the flow of data @xcite , taint @xcite or provenance @xcite in computer programs or systems .",
    "in general , we can not assume that the structure has a hierarchical or modular organization , and so clustering or decomposition techniques do not solve the task at hand .",
    "instead , we introduce a natural construction ( originally proposed by mukesh dalal ) that can be used in many circumstances to delete irrelevant vertices and identify related vertices ( and though of course clustering and decomposition techniques can have something to say in the determination of these vertices , this issue will not be considered here ) .",
    "subsequently , we can reason about paths in this construction rather than in its larger antecedent structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : basics ] , we introduce basic notation and definitions ;  [ sec : vertexabstraction ] is a sort of appetizer from the point of view of vertices rather than paths ;  [ sec : detoursbypassesabstractions ] introduces the key constructions for digraphs , which are generalized in  [ sec : weighteddigraphs ] to weighted digraphs .",
    "random digraphs are considered in  [ sec : randomdigraphs ] .",
    "so - called temporal networks that are essentially time series of arcs are considered in  [ sec : temporalnetworks ] .",
    "finally , appendices give alternative proofs of key results for digraphs and briefly indicate the potential relevance of our constructions to renormalization and percolation on random digraphs .",
    "in this paper we generally follow ( or at least adapt in an obvious way ) the definitions and notation of @xcite without further comment . in particular , digraphs are loopless , so digraph morphisms are unambiguously defined in terms of their action on vertices .",
    "also , @xmath5 indicates a set of arcs ; the adjacency matrix corresponding to a colored / labeled digraph , directed multigraph , or weighted digraph @xmath0 is @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 takes values in an appropriate commutative semiring , e.g. , the boolean semiring for digraphs .",
    "we use @xmath7 and @xmath8 to denote both ordinary arithmetic and generic semiring operations , while @xmath9 denotes either logical disjunction or maximum depending on context ; similarly , @xmath10 denotes either logical conjunction or minimum . for digraphs and the real semiring @xmath11 for weighted digraphs .",
    "other examples of potential relevance are the tropical semiring @xmath12 @xcite , the fuzzy semiring @xmath13 , \\vee , \\wedge)$ ] , the bottleneck semiring @xmath14 , the log semiring @xmath15 with @xmath16 , the viterbi semiring @xmath13 , \\vee , \\cdot)$ ] , etc . for general background on semirings ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there is no truly standard definition of a semiring , and the same appears to be true of related notions . rather than invoking necessarily idiosyncratic terminology to remove any ambiguity here ,",
    "we ( perhaps atypically ) choose to rely on common sense .",
    "for instance , we will require a zero element to indicate the absence of arcs , but this need not be a neutral element for the additive operation .",

    "the vertex contraction @xmath383 is defined in the obvious way : triples of the form @xmath384 and @xmath385 for @xmath386 are replaced with @xmath387 and @xmath388 , respectively , and similarly for triples involving @xmath119 .",
    "thus @xmath389 , so additional vertices and temporal arcs are generated in the formation of @xmath390 .",

    "the lemma now reduces to the already established version for digraphs by contracting vertices with the same time coordinate in each copy of @xmath393 . @xmath64",
    "the surprising noncommutativity of detours / bypasses for dtcns is not the only difference from the situation for digraphs .",
    "there are at least two random dtcns that are obvious analogues of @xmath251 ( cf .",
    " [ sec : randomdigraphs ] ) :    * @xmath394 , with sources and targets corresponding to @xmath251 and times uniformly random in @xmath276 $ ] ; * @xmath395 , with contacts between @xmath209 poisson distributed over @xmath276 $ ] with rate @xmath396 .",
    "that is , the probability of a contact between @xmath209 in an interval of infinitesmal duration @xmath397 is given by @xmath398 .",
    "it is easy to see that both of these have an expected number of contacts equal to @xmath399 .",
    "furthermore , for the regime of interest @xmath400 , these two random dtcns can be expected to behave quite similarly , akin to the erds - rnyi and gilbert random graphs .    rather than attempting to develop analytical results",
    ", we proceed directly to numerics .",
    "the basic observation from figure [ fig : dtcnprobability ] is that the number of contacts in @xmath401 is much less than the number of arcs in @xmath402 , because there are fewer temporally coherent paths between two vertices in @xmath403 than there are ordinary paths between the same two vertices in @xmath251 .",
    "in particular , given @xmath404 , the probability that the path @xmath405 exists in @xmath251 is @xmath406 , whereas the probability that a temporally coherent version of the same path exists in @xmath403 is @xmath407 @xmath64    the author is grateful to mukesh dalal for proposing the idea of the paper , and to yingbo song for patiently allowing it to unfold .",
