    "several recent papers ( udomprasert et al .",
    "1997 , cotton 1997 and taylor 1998 & 2000 ) have demonstrated that extreme values of faraday rotation of up to 40000   in the rest frame of quasars are possible .",
    "@xcite showed that the rotation measure ( rm ) properties of quasars vary on both small spatial ( parsec ) scales and short timescales ( 1.5@xmath03 years ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the observed rm distributions are intrinsic to the central few hundred parsecs of agn and are not a foreground effect from the host galaxy ism , the icm , or the milky way .",
    "hence , the observed faraday rotation can serve as a probe of the magnetic field weighted by the electron density along the line of sight near the central engines of agn . with the electron density supplied by spectral line diagnostics ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) an estimate of the magnetic field strength and orientation",
    "can be made provided one assumes a physically reasonable path length .",
    "to date parsec - scale rm observations have only been made for quasars .",
    "polarimetric observations of other classes of agn are required in order to test the unified model for agn @xcite by looking for orientation effects in the rm distributions . in order to form a more complete picture of the parsec scale rm properties of agn",
    "@xcite designed a sample of 40 quasars , bl lacs , and radio galaxies for polarimetric observations .",
    "we have completed this survey with the vlba and present here the first sub - parsec scale rm maps for radio galaxies .",
    "we assume h@xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath5=0.5 throughout .",
    "the observations , performed on 2000 june 27 ( 2000.40 ) , were carried out at seven widely separated frequencies between 8.1 and 15.2 ghz using the 10 element vlba .",
    "amplitude calibration and fringe - fitting were performed as in @xcite .",
    "feed polarizations of the antennas were determined using the aips task lpcal .",
    "this calibration was performed twice , first using j0136@xmath6478 with an accompanying clean model for this polarized source .",
    "plots of the real versus imaginary crosshand polarization data indicated that a satisfactory d - term solution was obtained .",
    "after this calibration was performed j2022@xmath6616 was found to be unpolarized .",
    "the d - terms were solved for again using j2022@xmath6616 as an unpolarized calibrator as a consistency check .",
    "both sources produced nearly identical corrections for the d - terms , and j2022@xmath6616 was used as the final d - term calibrator .",
    "absolute electric vector position angle ( evpa ) calibration was determined by using the evpa s of j0854@xmath6201 , j0927@xmath6390 , j1310@xmath6323 and j2202@xmath6422 listed in the vla monitoring programsmyers / calibration/ ] @xcite .",
    "the evpa calibration at 8 ghz was readily obtained from the polarization calibration website .",
    "the observations were interpolated in time as necessary .",
    "polarization monitoring observations at 8 and 22 ghz were interpolated to produce position angles at 12 and 15 ghz .",
    "figure 1 shows calibrated position angle results for these four calibrators with the associated vla data from the website . as a further test of our evpa calibration we examined the rotation measure of component c4 of 3c279 after the evpa calibration was completed . in @xcite c4 was shown to have a relatively low rm and @xmath7 at 8 ghz to @xmath8 at 15 ghz 2000 january 27 .",
    "after the evpa calibration for this experiment was completed we measured c4 and the evpa was @xmath9   for all frequencies .",
    "although c4 does vary its position angle and rm with time the agreement between the observations of 2000 january and 2000 july suggests that the polarization calibration was performed correctly .    to perform the rotation measure analysis data cubes in @xmath10",
    "were constructed .",
    "there are four points across the 8 ghz band , and three points at 12.1 , 12.5 , and 15.17 ghz .",
    "this provides adequate short and long spacings in @xmath10 to properly recover rms between @xmath11 30000 .",
    "the 12 and 15 ghz images used to produce the polarization angle maps were tapered to approximate the 8 ghz resolution , and a restoring beam matched to the 8 ghz beam was used .",
    "this well studied galaxy was shown by @xcite to have an average rm of @xmath12   which varied from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "our observations similarly show an extreme rm of @xmath15 to @xmath16  22@xmath024 mas from the core ( fig .",
    "2 ) . this rm distribution is coincident with a peak in total intensity which appears displaced northward from the inner 15 mas of the jet .",
    "the rms are mostly between @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the exception of a patch where the rms increase in magnitude by a factor two while changing sign to a positive slope .",
    "the sign change of the slope is significant , as it requires the magnetic field to change direction over a projected distance of 0.3 pc .",
    "good agreement to the @xmath10 signature of faraday rotation is seen as indicated by the inset plots in figure 2 .",
    "although the significant polarized flux at 8 ghz is limited to the region of the rm signal there is some ( 4.5 @xmath11 0.4 mjy ) polarized emission at 15 ghz closer to the core .",
    "this occurs at @xmath19 17 mas from the core , in a @xmath20 of total intensity ( at 15 ghz ) between the inner jet and the displaced peak in i at 22@xmath024 mas .",
    "the lack of corresponding polarized emission at 8 or 12 ghz is consistent with faraday depolarization at lower frequencies if the rm gradient is greater than 2370  mas@xmath4 .",
    "this broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) @xcite exhibits a gradient in rm towards the core . the rm changes from @xmath21  at 4 mas from the core to @xmath22  on the side of the jet closest to the core . as for m87 ,",
    "the polarized emission at 8 ghz for 3c111 is limited to the region of the rm color overlay in figure 3 .",
    "however , significant polarized emission at 15 ghz ( 5.9 @xmath11 0.4 mjy ) exists within 2 mas of the core in 3c111 . at the location of the left - hand insert in figure 3",
    "the percent polarization is 12@xmath23 at 15 ghz .",
    "the percent polarization 1.3 mas ne of the core is 1.5@xmath23 at the same frequency .",
    "3c120 is another blrg @xcite and its polarization properties were monitored over 16 months with the vlba by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported an rm in the jet of 3c120 of @xmath24  based on measurements at 22 and 43 ghz .",
    "our observation a little more than a year after g ' omez et al . shows a much smaller rm distribution . in figure 4",
    "it is apparent that 3c120 has the lowest jet rm distribution of the three radio galaxies presented here , @xmath25 .",
    "the time variability of parsec scale rms as seen in @xcite is also present in 3c120 @xcite and may account for the difference between our results and those of g ' omez et al .",
    "contrary to m87 and 3c111 , 3c120 has detectable polarized emission at all frequencies in the core and rms of @xmath26  are present . as seen in figure 4 the rm fits show considerable scatter at 8 ghz , and the reality of the sign change in the core rm distribution ( from @xmath62000 to @xmath01000 ) is suspect as the negative slope area shows deviations from a @xmath10 law . the polarized flux within the core ranges from 4 @xmath11 0.6 mjy at 8 ghz to @xmath27 @xmath11 0.6 mjy at 12 and 15 ghz .",
    "the range of @xmath28 ( 15ghz ) in the jet reach maxima of 9@xmath016@xmath23 , but within 1 mas from the center of the stokes i image @xmath28 falls to 3@xmath23 or less .",
    "unified models for agn describe radio galaxies as substantially inclined to the line of sight .",
    "this scenario places the core of a radio galaxy behind a dense multi - phase obscuring disk .",
    "the disk is expected to produce a high enough rm that the radio galaxy core is essentially unpolarized .",
    "such a picture appears reasonable for m87 , which is classified as a narrow line radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "this picture is supported by the lack of any polarized emission from the core of m87 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the requisite disk was first reported by @xcite , although recent ir observations of m87 failed to detect the expected dust torus @xcite .",
    "even if the thick dust torus is absent a mechanism which accounts for the lack of polarized flux less than 17 mas from the core is still required .",
    "invoking a depolarizing faraday screen requires such a screen to have a thickness of at least 3 parsecs .",
    "the rm data also require that the magnetic field be disordered on sub - parsec scales due to the sign change seen in the rm in figure 2 .",
    "3c111 and 3c120 are classified as blrgs and thus are expected to have jets more inclined towards the observer . therefore , more polarized emission near the core might be expected as the central engine is uncovered by the obscuring torus .",
    "this is supported by the presence of polarized flux density at 15 ghz in the core for 3c111 and at all three frequencies for 3c120 , consistent with their classification as blrgs .",
    "figure 5 illustrates this argument as both 3c111 and 3c120 have polarized emission at 15 ghz in their central regions .",
    "some caveats must be presented in this interpretation .",
    "although m87 is classified as a nlrg , @xcite report that the ly@xmath29 emission line has a width of 3000 km sec@xmath4 which suggests that at least some of the broad line region ( blr ) is indeed visible . using a black hole mass of 2.4 @xmath30 m@xmath31 @xcite a velocity of 1860 km sec@xmath4",
    "is achieved at an orbital radius of 3 parsecs .",
    "thus , the rm distribution observed in m87 may be produced by the blr itself .",
    "m87 is also a relatively low luminosity radio galaxy and may not provide a realistic comparison to more luminous objects .",
    "lastly , the proximity of m87 also serves to expose details in its inner structure which may escape notice in 3c111 and 3c120 due to their greater distance .",
    "given that faraday rotation occurs , what part of the agn plays the role of the faraday screen ? in @xcite this role was assigned to the narrow line region ( nlr ) itself , and the assumed properties of the nlr seemed consistent with the observed rms .",
    "however , the nlr is assumed to have a low volume filling factor @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "taking a typical value for @xmath32 of @xmath33 gives a covering factor of 0.01 .",
    "therefore , assuming a random distribution of nlr clouds , one should not expect the coherent rm distributions observed if only 1 percent of the beam is intersected by the screen .",
    "alternatively , the screen may consist of clouds which are entrained by the jet , perhaps in a boundary layer .",
    "this would account for the observed covering factor of the screen .",
    "a similar idea is put forth by @xcite who propose a cloud 0.4 pc across to explain the light curves and polarization properties of components in 3c120 .    to estimate a b field for a boundary layer screen in m87 we assume a scale size of 0.3 parsecs for clumps within the screen to match the scale size of the sign change of the rm slope .",
    "we use the electron density n@xmath34 of 1100 @xmath35 from @xcite to obtain a magnetic field strength of 16@xmath034 @xmath36gauss .",
    "such a field strength seems weak compared to zeeman measurements in the center of our own galaxy of 0.5 mg @xcite to 3 mg @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field is in equilibrium with a gas at a temperature of 10@xmath37k and using the electron density of @xcite a magnetic field strength of 200@xmath36gauss is obtained .",
    "the presence of broad ly@xmath29 lines in m87 prompts consideration of the blr as a faraday screen .",
    "as discussed in  4 the observed ly@xmath29 velocity could be found within 3 parsecs of the black hole , placing the ly@xmath29 clouds along the line of sight to the jet in our vlba images .",
    "however , at the expected density of n@xmath34 10@xmath38 @xmath35 @xcite the blr clouds are optically thick at 8@xmath015 ghz @xcite .",
    "lastly , we consider the hot , tenuous gas that is expected to confine the nlr clouds .",
    "such a gas is expected to be disordered and radiation propagating through it should experience a random walk rm effect .",
    "this would produce an rm with a zero mean , gaussian distribution .",
    "such a distribution is definitely lacking for m87 and 3c111 , and possibly for 3c120 as well . without tighter constraints on the physical parameters",
    "it is not possible to discriminate between these , or other , faraday screen scenarios .",
    "we thank avi loeb for pointing out the possible significance of the blr in the rm distribution of m87 .",
    "we also thank j. l. gmez for comments on the manuscript .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with nasa , and nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
