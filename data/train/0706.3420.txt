    "in studying statistical aspects of non - equilibrium surfaces the onset of scaling regimes at both large time and length scales has enabled one to characterize a vast body of growth processes in terms of universality classes [ ] . in analogy to equilibrium phase transitions , there is consensus in that the late evolution stages of these processes are controlled by a set of scaling exponents stemming ultimately from the symmetries and conservations laws of the underlying growth rules . a basic quantity of interest investigated extensively in this context concerns the roughness or surface width @xmath0 developed by growth fluctuations at a given time @xmath1 when starting from an initially flat substrate of typical length @xmath2 . based on a wide range of theoretical and numerical studies",
    "it can be argued that @xmath3 scales as [ ] @xmath4 with a universal scaling function behaving as @xmath5 for @xmath6 , whereas for @xmath7 it remains constant .",
    "consequently , for @xmath8 the width saturates as @xmath9 while growing as @xmath10 in the thermodynamic limit . the roughening exponent @xmath11 measures the stationary dependence of the surface width on the typical substrate size while @xmath12 , frequently referred to as the dynamic exponent , gives the fundamental scaling between length and time .    in this work we focus on rather unusual scaling properties studied in recent years both in one [ ] and two dimensional interfaces [ ] by means of discrete models of surface growth .",
    "for simplicity , here we consider a body - centered solid - on - solid ( bcsos ) version of these [ ] , limiting height differences between neighbors to @xmath13 rather than to @xmath14 , as in restricted sos realizations [ ] .",
    "our basic kinetic steps ( depicted schematically in fig.[schematic ] ) , involve adsorption and desorption , possibly after recombination , of dimers only .",
    "attempts of desorption can take place whether or not the selected pair of adjacent monomers arrived together .",
    "therefore , the rule for evaporation allows for reconstitution of dimers , a crucial feature , so their identity is not maintained during the growth process .",
    "-4.5 cm   for a one dimensional bcsos dimer growing interface .",
    "adding or removing a dimer ( denoted by dotted lines ) at columns @xmath15 can be viewed as flipping the spin-@xmath16 quartet @xmath17 .",
    "the involved rates depend on the change of surface tension ( [ tensionh ] ) which is in turn determined by the spin ( or slope ) states of @xmath18 and @xmath19 [ see eqs.([ratesh ] ) and ( [ rates ] ) ] .",
    "each situation is depicted schematically from ( a ) to ( d ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] -7.2 cm    it is important to note that throughout the stochastic evolution the parity of the number of monomers ( eventually isolated ) is conserved at each height level of the surface . the implications of this ` evenness ' non local constraint on the scaling exponents are far reaching [ ] , and in the one dimensional @xmath20 case have been analyzed in terms of even visiting random walks . in this latter representation ,",
    "interface configurations are thought of as brownian paths whose locations ( i.e. height levels ) are visited an even number of times before the walk terminates on a given time interval ( here playing the role of the substrate length ) .",
    "in marked contrast to normal random walks , the evenness constraint introduces highly correlated movements giving rise to an anomalous ( sub diffusive ) mean square displacement , which in the interface language means a saturated width scaling _ not _ as @xmath21 but rather as @xmath22 [ ] . also , the dynamic exponents @xmath23 obtained numerically for these [ ] and related globally constrained systems [ ] are definitely different from those of usual monomer type interfaces , irrespective of the later evolving towards equilibrium or nonequilibrium stationary regimes ( as exemplified respectively by the edward - wilkinson [ ] ( ew ) and kardar - parisi - zhang [ ] ( kpz ) universality classes ) .",
    "these anomalous aspects of non local constraints should not be regarded as purely academic .",
    "in fact , in catalytic surface processes the interplay between the substrate geometry and the shape of the intervening objects does matter .",
    "in particular , dimers become relevant in the roughening dynamic of vicinal surfaces which only allows deposition and evaporation of diatomic molecules [ ] .    to our knowledge",
    ", there are no available phenomenological equations of growth ( e.g. kpz , ew ) , suitable to describe interface fluctuations arising from deposition - evaporation of _ composite _ particles .",
    "the manner in which non localities could be incorporated in that continuum limit is by far not clear .",
    "however , in probing the robustness of the dissociative dimer models referred to above some progress can be made by introducing a continuously tunable parameter without affecting neither the symmetries nor the conservation laws of their dynamics .",
    "specifically , we consider a finite temperature extension of @xmath24 dimer growing interfaces , which for the ease of our numerical analysis ( sec .",
    "iiia ) , is here taken under detailed balance conditions .",
    "following ref .",
    "[ ] , this is readily done through a standard surface tension term associated to configurational energy scales which discourage the development of strong fluctuations , besides those already prevented by both bcsos and evenness constraints . in spite of these severe restrictions",
    ", they should not impede us to evaluate scaling exponents , as equilibrium surfaces at finite temperatures are always rough in @xmath24 .",
    "in the case of @xmath24-monomer growing interfaces , the surface tension is not relevant to drive them out of their universality classes , though interestingly in @xmath25 it can change the nonlinear term sign of the kpz equation thus inducing rough - to - rough transitions [ ] .",
    "surprisingly , for dimers it will turn out that the combined effects of global constraints and surface tension entail significant changes in the @xmath12 dynamic exponent , suggesting rather a non - universal temperature dependent value .",
    "in fact , non - universal aspects were already observed over wide temperature ranges in the monomer systems studied in refs .",
    "[ ] , although they were ascribed to finite size effects which become particularly severe in nearing the equilibrium roughening transition temperature @xmath26 [ ] .",
    "however as mentioned above , in our @xmath24 case @xmath27 is strictly zero and in practice all equilibrium correlation lengths can be fairly bounded as long as temperatures are not taken too low . in this sense , it is worth mentioning that steep variations of @xmath12 will already appear within high temperature regimes ( sec .",
    "by contrast , the roughening exponent @xmath11 remains robust as differences with respect to its vanishing tension limit @xmath28 , will basically merge with our numerical errors .",
    "since by definition @xmath29 is a stationary index , it is just the nonequilibrium dynamics that is being strongly affected , as we shall see .",
    "turning to methodological issues , as is known the dynamic scaling hypothesis referred to in eq.([ds ] ) is usually put forward to determine both @xmath11 and @xmath12 in a jointly way by simulating the growth dynamics over different substrate sizes . with the aim of obtaining an independent ( separate ) evaluation of these exponents , in addition to this standard procedure we will also exploit the known equivalence between bcsos models and interacting gases of hard - core particles [ ] . following the thread of ideas given in [ ]",
    ", we will recast the metropolis operator that rules our growth simulations in terms of a quantum spin representation .",
    "this latter lends itself more readily for a finite size scaling analysis of the _ gap _ of the metropolis operator which ultimately is related to the @xmath12 dynamic exponent . on the one hand this technique avoids the problem of dealing with long transient regimes though on the other",
    "is limited severely by the affordable substrate sizes .",
    "for now let us simply remark that already modest lengths are able to yield clear finite size trends over wide temperature ranges . to complement our approach , at low temperature regimes ( where correlation lengths exceed the sizes reachable by exact diagonalization ) ,",
    "we will rely on numerical simulations of much larger systems which along with eq.([ds ] ) will further support the non - universal picture .",
    "the layout of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we construct the quantum spin analogy of the standard metropolis dynamic and briefly touch upon symmetries and conservation laws . by means of an ulterior non - unitary spin rotation , this results in a symmetric representation of the metropolis operator .",
    "this simplifies considerably the subsequent numerical analysis of sec .",
    "iii in which the spectrum gap of this operator is obtained via standard recursive techniques [ ] .",
    "the evaluation of dynamic exponents is then extended to low temperature regimes using standard monte carlo simulations .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv contains a summarizing discussion along with some remarks on extensions of this work .",
    "as usual , the state of a solid - on - solid interface is represented by a set of single - valued functions @xmath30 denoting height levels at positions @xmath31 measured at a given time @xmath1 from a reference substrate of length @xmath2 . as mentioned earlier , to prevent arbitrary bulk fluctuations we impose bcsos constraints on these heights which hereafter",
    "are taken to satisfy @xmath32 , along with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "growth or evaporation of the interface involves two particles ( dimers ) at the top of columns @xmath33 which , to comply with the above restrictions , ought both to be local extrema of the evolving interface .",
    "more specifically , deposition ( evaporation ) events @xmath34 can only occur at two consecutive local minima ( maxima ) of the heights set ( see fig.[schematic ] ) .",
    "we stress that evaporation takes place regardless if these maxima were created together or not , so dimers can dissociate .",
    "also note that the number of heights at a given level preserves its parity throughout .",
    "we want the transition rates of these processes to depend on the surface tension @xmath35 referred to in sec .",
    "i. in turn , any model that associates energies to height differences should provide a plausible description of @xmath35 .",
    "due to our bcsos choice @xmath36 , evidently the simplest form of @xmath35 should assign an energy @xmath37 to each double facet exposed between columns @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40 , this may be studied by defining @xmath41 which simply counts the total number of double facets in a given interface configuration .",
    "therefore , we can construct a standard metropolis process at temperature @xmath42 after introducing the following transition probability rates @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the change in surface tension upon depositing @xmath45 or removing @xmath46 a dimer at @xmath47 ( henceforth , the boltzmann constant @xmath48 is set equal to one ) .",
    "the four possible scenarios determining the values of these rates , which by construction obey detailed balance ( that is @xmath49 , are schematized in fig.[schematic ] .",
    "clearly , in the high temperature limit we recover the dimer model considered in [ ] , whereas @xmath50 serves to favor smooth states over long transient regimes .",
    "it is often more practical to work in terms of slopes rather than with interface heights , so in what follows we will employ the known mapping between bcsos and hard core particle dynamics [ ] . this correspondence is easily visualized in fig.[schematic ] which simply associates the height differences @xmath51 to particles @xmath52 or vacancies @xmath53 .",
    "conversely , the interface heights are obtained as @xmath54 , modulo a constant level . in particular , in this picture the surface tension reduces to the ising hamiltonian @xmath55 up to an irrelevant constant ; whereas after some straightforward manipulations , the square deviation of the instantaneous average height @xmath56 of a particular slope configuration @xmath57 , i.e. a given realization of the interface ` width ' @xmath58 , has the form @xmath59 creating ( eliminating ) a dimer now amounts to a backwards @xmath60 ( forwards @xmath61 ) move of two particles at a time , whereas from eq.([tension ] ) it can be readily checked that in this representation the corresponding rates ( [ ratesh ] ) just involve the neighboring states of the flipped quartet @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 with @xmath64 being from now on our inverse temperature parameter .",
    "note also that under pbc the interface ` magnetization ' @xmath65 vanishes at all evolution stages .",
    "in addition , some constants of motion can be immediately identified .",
    "evidently , the dimer dynamic exchanges two particles between four consecutive sites while changing the occupation of the involved next nearest neighbor locations by the same amount . if we think of these sites as being part of a four - partite lattice @xmath66 ( @xmath67 even ) , hence upon defining @xmath68 as the magnetization of sublattice @xmath69 it is clear that the set of dependent quantities @xmath70 ( of which only three are independent ) , is left invariant throughout . from a more fundamental point of view",
    "these conservations arise ultimately from continuous symmetries borne by the metropolis operator controlling the probabilities of our slope states , and towards which we now turn .",
    "as is known , the evolution operator of a markovian process of the kind discussed so far can be constructed generically as [ ] @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the transition rate at which configuration @xmath73 evolves to @xmath74 per unit time .",
    "at least formally , this enables one to derive all subsequent probability distributions @xmath75 from the action of the evolution operator on a given initial state , that is @xmath76 [ ] . in our problem ,",
    "@xmath77 for all compatibles @xmath78 , and the specific form of @xmath79 can be readily found by interpreting the slope configurations @xmath80 as eigenstates of the @xmath12 component , say , of pauli matrices @xmath81 assigned to each slope site .",
    "for instance , using spin-@xmath16 raising and lowering operators @xmath82 , the operational analog of eq.([non - diagg ] ) will then read @xmath83 where the adsorption ( desorption ) or double exchange operator @xmath84 @xmath85 acting on the @xmath86-quartet referred to above is simply @xmath87 here , @xmath88 are thought of as diagonal operators in the @xmath89 representation and whose elements are identified with the rates of eq.([rates ] ) . in this regard ,",
    "the ordering of application in ( [ non - diag ] ) is immaterial . as for the diagonal elements of eq.([conservation ] ) , needed for conservation of probability , they basically count the number of ways in which a given configuration @xmath73 can evolve to different states @xmath90 by flipping an active quartet at a time .",
    "this can be properly tracked down in terms of number operators @xmath91 and weighting each probed quartet with its corresponding rate ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the counterpart of eq.([conservation ] ) then becomes @xmath93 which along with eq.([non - diag ] ) completes the form of our metropolis operator .",
    "taking into account the spin algebra @xmath94   = \\delta_{i , j}\\,\\sigma^z_j,\\,$ ] @xmath95 the former finally reduces to @xmath96 by construction @xmath79 is a stochastic operator and therefore its ground state @xmath97 has vanishing eigenvalue and corresponds to the detailed balance solution of the problem , i.e. @xmath98 . instead ,",
    "its _ left _ ground state @xmath99 is an equally weighted linear combination of all reachable @xmath100 ( note that @xmath79 is a non hermitian operator whose columns add up to zero ) . with the aid of this left state and starting from an initial probability distribution @xmath101 ,",
    "typical quantities of interest , such as the interface width @xmath102 , are calculated as @xmath103 [ ] . here ,",
    "the ` width operator ' @xmath104 is obtained by promoting the slopes of eq.([width ] ) to @xmath89 matrices .    despite the apparent simplicity of our metropolis operator",
    ", the @xmath105 s above can not be associated to elementary excitations of any kind and exact analytic treatments may seem unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , eq.([non - hermitian ] ) will permit some numerical progress on finite size systems after considering a simple transformation to be discussed later on in sec .",
    "iic . before that and for the sake of completeness",
    ", we pause to digress briefly about symmetries and conservation laws of @xmath79 .      here we follow refs . [ ] in closely related processes . recalling that under a rotation by an angle @xmath106 around the @xmath12-direction @xmath107",
    "transform as @xmath108 , we can therefore choose angles @xmath109 for all spins in each sublattice @xmath69 such that eq.([a ] ) [ and obviously ( [ diag ] ) ] is left invariant . clearly , this is the case of @xmath110 on the other hand , the infinitesimal generator of this transformation is @xmath111 , with @xmath112 . since @xmath113 , then @xmath114 = 0\\,$ ] , and therefore @xmath115 is preserved by @xmath79 .",
    "but from the constraint ( [ angles ] ) it follows that @xmath115 can be rewritten in terms of three independent angles , that is @xmath116 $ ] from which one recovers the three conserved quantities identified before on more intuitive grounds .",
    "these continuous symmetries entail a number of invariant subspaces growing at most as @xmath117 , which however by no means exhaust all possibilities .",
    "for instance , it is straightforward to see that already the number of jammed configurations ( i.e. states that can not evolve further ) , grows _ exponentially _ with the system size [ ] . this unusual proliferation of invariant states should be the consequence of a much higher symmetry of @xmath79 .",
    "although its explicit operational form might be difficult to figure out , we can nevertheless follow ref . [ ] and construct an exponential number of dynamically disjoint sectors , either jammed or unjammed , regardless of the value of @xmath118 . to this end",
    ", one defines a reduction rule by looking at the occurrence of groups of active quartets in a given configuration @xmath73 .",
    "each occurrence , if any , is deleted so the length of the remaining object is reduced in 4-bits per deletion .",
    "this procedure is applied recursively until one is left with a string that can not be further reduced , i.e. an _",
    "_ @xmath119 . in turn , the result is unique irrespective of the order of deletion . to mention only a few examples : @xmath120 ( either in one or two steps ) ; the flat interface or antiferro state yields a null string , whereas any jammed configuration is already an irreducible string of length @xmath2 .",
    "the key issue to bear in mind is that two states @xmath73 and @xmath74 belong to the same @xmath79-subspace @xmath121 [ ] .",
    "so , this non - local construct picks out both the length @xmath122 and the sequence of the irreducible string s elements ( their combinations growing exponentially in @xmath123 ) , and ultimately defines the constant of motion under which the @xmath79-dynamics take place .",
    "that being said , from now on we shall content ourselves with studying just the null string subspace selected by initially flat conditions , for the most part quite natural in the context of growing interfaces .",
    "note also that the equilibrium properties of the @xmath24-hamiltonian ( [ tension ] ) are neither analytically simple to evaluate ( e.g. eq.([width ] ) , not even for @xmath124 ) , as the ensemble of averaged states must be consistent not only with @xmath125 ( pbc ) but with a vanishing irreducible string as well ( totally unjammed conditions ) , which rules out an exponential number of states .",
    "returning to the discussion of sec.iia , we may make some progress on the numerical analysis of @xmath79 by performing a similarity transformation so as to map this operator into an hermitian matrix .",
    "this is feasible because detailed balance in rates ( [ rates ] ) ensures the existence of a representation in which the evolution operator is self adjoint [ ] . for this purpose",
    ", it suffices to consider a diagonal transformation alike the one discussed in sec .",
    "iib but using pure imaginary angles instead .",
    "specifically , we rotate each @xmath86th spin around the @xmath12-direction by a site dependent angle ( field operator ) @xmath126 by means of the nonunitary similarity transformation @xmath127 . under this rotation @xmath128 , so it is simple to check that the double hopping operators of eq.([a ] ) transform as @xmath129 this introduces new diagonal operators @xmath130 in the @xmath89 representation , that like the @xmath88 operators commute with @xmath131 , and in terms of which the off diagonal part of @xmath79 becomes symmetric .",
    "more specifically , this symmetrization is produced by defining @xmath132 their diagonal elements being @xmath133 . as a result , eq.([non - diag",
    "] ) is transformed into @xmath134 while eq.([diag ] ) is left unchanged , so the rotated metropolis operator @xmath135 can be finally cast in the symmetric form @xmath136    consequently , the time dependent probability distribution turns out to be a superposition of orthogonal eigenlevels @xmath137 with _ real _ eigenvalues @xmath138 of @xmath139 , each having typical lifetimes @xmath140 .",
    "in particular , the ground state @xmath141 has eigenvalue @xmath142 , and is just the transformed boltzmann distribution @xmath97 referred to above , i.e. @xmath143 . since left and right levels now coincide , it is thereby a simple matter to check that in the symmetric representation the dynamic of any diagonal observable , say the interface width @xmath144 ( in turn invariant under @xmath145 ) , can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the saturation width reached at equilibrium , whereas @xmath148 denotes the transformed initial distribution . from here",
    "we see that if the spectrum gap vanishes as @xmath149 , then a finite size scaling analysis of the first excited levels @xmath150 will provide the dynamic @xmath12-exponent ruling over the late roughening stages referred to in sec .",
    "i.    it is worth pointing out that the discussion presented so far can be readily extended to include monomers @xmath151 , trimers @xmath152 , etc .",
    ", so long as the operators involved in eq.([symmetric ] ) are reinterpreted as @xmath153 in particular , for monomers with no surface tension ( @xmath124 ) the evolution operator reduces to the fully isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet , thus recovering the usual ew dynamic exponent @xmath154 . among other numerical aspects , in what follows",
    "we shall focus on the evaluation of this quantity at @xmath155 for both @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the above ideas provide an alternative manner to evaluate dynamic exponents , independently of those obtained by the application of the dynamic scaling hypothesis ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "thus , we first explore the consequences arising from the exact diagonalization of eq.([symmetric ] ) in small systems , and then go on to corroborate them over larger length scales [ via eq.([ds ] ) ] using standard monte carlo simulations .",
    "in addition , these latter will complement the evaluation of @xmath12 in low temperature regimes where , as we shall see , resorting to small lattice sizes might become inadequate .      to analyze our stochastic matrix we first obtained its null string basis using dimers on rings of sizes @xmath158 .",
    "this was easily implemented by applying @xmath139 ( or alternatively , @xmath79 ) to either of the two antiferro states and keeping proper track of the new generated configurations . by iterating this procedure with those new states for which @xmath139 was not previously applied ,",
    "the whole null - string subspace was finally expanded .",
    "the total number of states so found is of course independent of @xmath118 , and as expected ( see sec .",
    "iib ) , grows slower than the monomer space dimensionality @xmath159 .",
    "more specifically , this dimension seems to increase as @xmath160 , at least for the sizes at hand , which in turn allowed us to explore rings of up to 32 sites [ ] .",
    "once having identified the null string configurations , we proceeded to evaluate exactly the low lying levels of @xmath139 ( in principle , just the first excited will do ) , via a recursion type lanczos algorithm [ ] .",
    "starting that recursion from a random linear combination of null strings but chosen orthogonal to the boltzmann - type distribution @xmath161 referred to above , we then obtained the finite size behavior of the dimer gap , i.e. of @xmath162 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[gaps ] for several temperatures within the range @xmath163 indicating a gap decrease @xmath164 , however notice that the data do not fall into parallel straight lines . in an attempt to standardize this situation we used scalings of the form @xmath165 , but",
    "a large amount of uncertainty in both @xmath166 and @xmath167 raised doubts about the adequacy of such a procedure . also , logarithmic corrections were attempted but no evidence supporting these latter were found .",
    "thus , in principle we are led to suggest a plain power law decay although with a _ non - universal _ temperature dependent dynamic exponent @xmath168 . in particular , @xmath169 is in fair agreement with the value obtained in ref .",

    "nonetheless , a simple numerical fit of both amplitudes and slopes indicates that most of our data ( @xmath209 ) can be accounted for by the parametrization @xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "this means that in equilibrium the interface becomes actually rough so long as @xmath212 is held in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "to summarize , we have studied numerically the dynamics of dimer growing interfaces at finite temperatures using two independent procedures .",
    "the first one analyzes the spectrum gap of the evolution operator [ eq.([symmetric ] ) ] by exact diagonalization of small systems , thus picking out dynamic exponents in a direct manner .",
    "clear finite size trends were obtained in the range @xmath163 ( fig.[gaps ] ) , and fairly bounded extrapolations were derived for @xmath12 ( fig.[nonuniversal ] ) .",
    "although the non - local symmetries ( i.e. irreducible strings of sec . iib ) of our stochastic operators are unaffected by surface tensions , surprisingly the @xmath12 exponents are non - universal , being dependent on @xmath118 .",
    "yet , a theoretical interpretation of such puzzling behavior remains quite open .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the dynamics of monomers interfaces , as their tensions do not take over neither the ew nor the kpz universality classes , at least in @xmath216 dimensions [ ] .",
    "secondly , using the standard scaling hypothesis [ eq.([ds ] ) , fig.[dynamic ] ] we checked out these findings under lower temperature regimes where correlation lengths become larger than our maximum diagonalizable sizes ( fig.[correlations ] ) . despite the limited precision of this method for @xmath217 ,",
    "our results confirmed the non - universal tendency observed in sec .",
    "iiia . in turn ,",
    "measurements of growth exponents in much larger substrates ( fig.[evolution ] ) further validated the monotonic decrease of @xmath218 .",
    "as for the roughening exponents ( fig.[saturation ] ) , in all studied cases with @xmath217 the global constraint referred to in sec .",
    "i and further examined in terms of irreducible strings [ ] , led to anomalous motions of a rather unconventional type ( @xmath219 ) , as compared to levi flights and other restricted random paths [ ] .",
    "more specifically , they are consistent with those of even visiting random walks [ ] and not comprehensible in terms of ew or diffusive interfaces ( e.g. monomers ) , which are definitely rougher . under surface tension",
    "the range of correlations so introduced in the associated walk is finite , and therefore the scaling of its width must remain unchanged ( consult ref . [ ] ) , though in line with eq.([param ] ) , its proportionality constant might depend on the precise form of these correlations . to endow further this robustness of @xmath11 , it would be interesting to elucidate whether the analogy of non - interacting electrons moving in a random medium studied in ref .",
    "[ ] could be extended to the finite temperature interfaces ( walks ) investigated here .",
    "other pending issues of interest concern starting the growth process from more general initial conditions ( i.e. not in the null string sector ) , capable of modifying asymptotic regimes [ ] , as well as considering biased dynamics ( without detailed balance ) such as those analyzed in refs .",

    "iic is no longer useful and the unsymmetrization of the lanczos recursion would be inevitable [ ] .",
    "finally , @xmath220 dimensional generalizations of this study could shed light on the combined role that dimer dynamics and substrate geometry might have in catalytic processes .",
