    "the proposed signals of processes which open the access to new physics a very good understanding of the detectors and their responses to produced particles will be needed .",
    "an accurate calibration of particle detectors could be achieved by using processes with well known cross sections in which particles with well known properties are produced .",
    "a calibration of lhc detectors using @xmath7 or @xmath0 signals is proposed in several publications @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath7 or @xmath0 production is important because it plays a significant role in background processes connected to higgs production .",
    "another experimental motivation is provided by the possibility to measure the luminosity via @xmath0 boson production @xcite .    at the tevatron collider @xmath8",
    "production takes place at a typical @xmath9 and hence is dominated by scattering of quarks . because of the much higher energy , proton scattering at lhc will allow smaller proton energy fractions and will be dominated by gluon scattering .",
    "the @xmath7 mass provides a hard scale and allows a perturbative calculation of the hard matrix element .",

    "the longitudinal momentum fraction is considered to be dominant , such that the transverse momenta of the partons can be neglected as well as their virtualities , at small @xmath13 the transverse momenta entering the hard matrix element should become relevant .    at the lhc",
    "the larger center of mass energy allows @xmath8 production at even smaller @xmath13 such that the production of particles will be dominated by gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "moreover , in this situation we have to deal with two different large scales ( @xmath14 ) and logarithms of the form @xmath15^n$ ] arise which have to be resummed .",
    "this is realized by the leading logarithmic ( ll ) balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite or the ciafaloni - catani - fiorani - marchesini ( ccfm ) evolution equation @xcite which additionally resums terms of the form @xmath16^n$ ] and @xmath17^n$ ] . just as for dglap , it is possible to factorize the cross section into a convolution of process - dependent hard matrix elements with universal parton distributions .",
    "but as the virtualities and transverse momenta are no longer ordered ( as it is the case in dglap evolution ) , the matrix elements have to be taken off - shell , and the convolution has to be made also over transverse momenta with the so - called _ unintegrated parton densities_. this factorization scheme is called _ @xmath2-factorization",
    "_ @xcite or _ semi - hard approach _ @xcite and will be used in this work .",
    "there is also the notion of _ transverse momentum dependent _ ( tmd ) parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "but although in these approaches the transverse momentum of the parton is taken into account as well , this is only the case on the side of the parton density .",
    "the matrix element is calculated with incoming on - shell partons , and transversal momenta of the incoming partons are neglected .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that factorization within this approach is violated beyond nlo . in case of the @xmath2-factorization approach used in this work this is also expected .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in the bfkl approach beyond nlo multiple gluon exchange in the @xmath18-channel has to be taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we calculate and analyze @xmath0 and @xmath7 production associated with two quark jets provided by gluon - gluon fusion in @xmath2-factorization .",
    "we assume quasi - multi - regge - kinematics ( qmrk ) where the cluster of @xmath8 and the two quarks is well separated in rapidity from the proton remnants while the kinematics within that cluster is considered without any further assumption .",
    "in particular , we take into account the mass of the quarks . in this kinematic regime",
    "a gauge independent off - shell matrix element can be extracted due to high energy factorization .",
    "a similar calculation has been done in @xcite , where the authors calculated photon ( instead of @xmath19 ) production in the same framework .",
    "we calculated the matrix element independently and extended it to massive gauge bosons .",
    "in our work on massive gauge bosons production we especially focus on the predictions for lhc and compare with a collinear factorization based calculation .",
    "when this paper was in preparation , we learned about another group @xcite working on this process as well using the same theoretical approach , but laying more emphasis on confronting the theoretical predictions with experimental data and examining the role of quark contributions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section 2 we describe notation , kinematics of the process and the calculation of the matrix element . in section 3",
    "we present numerical results obtained from a calculation using the monte carlo generator cascade @xcite , where the matrix element squared was implemented . in section 4 we summarize the results and offer conclusions .",
    "we label the 4-momenta of incoming hadrons with masses @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . in the center of mass system",
    "they can be expressed in terms of invariant light like vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26    in the case of protons at the lhc we have @xmath27 which satisfies the relation @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath44 one can neglect terms proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the calculation .",

    "the hadronic and partonic cross section are related as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unintegrated gluon density in a proton and @xmath54 is the angle of @xmath55 with respect to some fixed axis in the azimuthal plane . the argument @xmath56 of unintegrated gluon densities is the factorization scale .",
    "the partonic cross section is denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "since the incoming gluons of the matrix element entering this partonic cross section are off - shell , the calculation differs from that of a hard matrix element in the collinear approach significantly . to guarantee gauge invariance",
    ", the process with off - shell incoming particles has to be embedded into the scattering of on - shell particles .",
    "the extracted off - shell matrix element is of course independent of the specific choice of the particles in which the scattering process is embedded .",

    "strong ordering of mandelstam variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 allows us to make a simplification of the coupling of gluons to incoming quarks . by neglecting the exchanged momentum in the vertex ,",
    "we get an eikonal vertex which does not depend on the spin of the particle coupled to gluon and preserves its spin . in detail",

    "the polarization sum for the @xmath59-channel gluon reduces to its feynman gauge analogue @xmath68 due to the heavy flavor current conservation .",
    "the same simplification takes place in our calculation .",

    "an important feature of the whole calculation is that it is possible to recover the result obtained in collinear factorization by neglecting the transverse momenta of the gluons when they enter the hard matrix element and instead integrate over them only in the gluon densities . due to factorization",
    "it is possible to keep this connection not only for the full cross section , but also for gluon densities and hard matrix element separately as well , provided that the explicit manifestations of the factorization formulae are phrased .",
    "the key point is the observation that @xmath102 as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gaugevector]-[eq : eikonaltimespolarization ] ) , in an appropriate gauge the polarization sum @xmath103 can be replaced by @xmath104 . since in this gauge one has to deal with exactly the same diagrams as in the on - shell calculation , by dressing the off - shell matrix element squared with the prefactor @xmath101 and performing the averaging over azimuthal angles of the ` incoming ' gluons , followed by taking the limit @xmath105 , one gets the collinear limit of the matrix element squared .",
    "the flux factor for off - shell gluons is defined as for on - shell gluons with @xmath106 . as",
    "the matrix element is gauge invariant , this connection remains valid when one performs the current calculation in a different gauge .",
    "due to the off - shellness of the incoming gluons and the three particle final state the final result of the matrix element squared is rather lengthy .",
    "for that reason , we calculated it independently and in different ways .",
    "one calculation followed directly the derivation above using feynman gauge for the gluons , and has been performed using mathematica .",
    "a second calculation written in form @xcite used an axial gauge as described above such that the lipatov vertices in are to be replaced by standard three - gluon - vertices .",
    "moreover this second method used the method of orthogonal amplitudes , described in @xcite , which affects the fermionic part of the matrix element and with which one is able to treat the matrix element squared in a more compact way .",
    "boson with those of the authors of @xcite whose cooperation we gratefully acknowledge . ]    for this second method a few technical details are elaborated in the remainder of this section .",
    "the method of orthogonal amplitudes is based on expressing a generic amplitude @xmath107 ( with one quark line ) in terms of a set of four independent operators @xmath108 , which satisfy orthogonality relations @xmath109 for any possible @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the `` norm '' of the operator @xmath113 .",
    "the projection of @xmath107 by an operator @xmath113 is performed in the following way @xmath114 the matrix element squared then has the following form @xmath115 in our case the matrix element consists of up to five dirac - matrices ( neglecting @xmath116 ) , after squaring one has to evaluate traces of up to twelve of them . in contrast",
    "the method of orthogonal amplitudes leads only to traces of up to eight dirac - matrices .",
    "if one wants to consider also the @xmath0 or @xmath117 coupling in the feynman diagram , one encounters a technical problem connected with the appearance of the dirac - matrix @xmath116 in the expression for the amplitude , leading to terms which include levi - civita tensors which later cancel . to avoid this complication , one can split the expression for the amplitude into two parts , one which does not include @xmath116 and the other one which does ( to separate the vector and axial part of the @xmath0 or @xmath7 boson coupling ) . for the part with @xmath116 one",
    "uses a base of operators @xmath118 .",
    "it is easy to check that they satisfy the same orthogonality relation like the operators @xmath113 .",
    "one also easily see that projections of amplitudes in which @xmath116 occurs do not contain terms with levi - civita tensors . in doing so , we extend the method of orthogonal amplitudes in a natural way .",
    "another complication comes from the presence of color factors in the expressions which are not numbers but matrices . to treat the projections as numbers ,",
    "it is necessary to separate the feynman diagrams into three groups according to different color factors , namely @xmath119 which form a vector @xmath120 ( components of @xmath121 are color factors of @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 correspondingly ) .",
    "one can then build a corresponding vector containing the sums of feynman diagrams without the color factors @xmath125 such that @xmath126    the lorentz indices have been dropped for simplicity .",
    "using the matrix @xmath127 the expression for the square of the matrix element takes the form @xmath128 where combinations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 are calculated using the projection method introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ projections ] , [ eq : sumprojections ] ) . for the final simplification",
    "we have diagonalized the matrix @xmath131 .",
    "after diagonalization of the matrix @xmath131 only two diagonal elements remain nonzero .",
    "this is expected because the quarks in the final state , in this process , can occur only in two possible color states .",
    "the last missing pieces needed to calculate the hadronic cross section using eq .  , are the unintegrated gluon densities . as mentioned in the introduction , there are two equations suited to describe the evolution of an unintegrated gluon density , namely bfkl @xcite and ccfm @xcite , respectively . both have been shown to agree on the leading logarithms in small @xmath13 @xcite , but the ccfm evolution is valid in the domain of larger @xmath13 as well and , moreover , matches in this region with dglap .",
    "therefore , we base our numerical studies on an unintegrated gluon density obeying the ccfm equation , which has been implemented in the monte carlo generator cascade @xcite .",
    "we also investigate how the results change when using updfs generated by a different procedure known as kmr @xcite .    for this purpose , we implemented the matrix element squared as described above into cascade .",
    "this implementation will be available in the next version of cascade .",
    "we have used the unintegrated parton distribution function ( updf ) ccfm 2003 set 3 for the numerical calculation .    to investigate the calculated matrix element as accurately as possible ,",
    "we neglect in this first study the effect of hadronization of the final state .",
    "we study in detail rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the produced gauge boson , quark and antiquark which ( if one assumes that quarks approximately determine jets ) are the most important observables in the experiment .",
    "furthermore , we compare the @xmath2-factorization approach to the collinear one . for this purpose",
    ", we compare the distributions obtained by our transverse momenta dependent matrix element with distributions obtained from the monte carlo generator mcfm @xcite which provides a calculation of the same process in the collinear limit . in that case the transverse momenta coming from the evolution are neglected .",
    "we also investigate in sec .",
    "[ updfs ] how the variation of unintegrated parton densities affect the azimuthal angle and transverse momenta distributions .    as an artefact of the perturbative calculation , the results depend on the renormalization scale @xmath132 and the factorization scale @xmath133 . in the ccfm formalism",
    "the hardest scale is set by the emission angle of the hardest subcollision .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the energy of the subcollision @xmath134 . for the comparison with collinear factorization calculations we have used as renormalization scale @xmath135 in @xmath2-factorization calculation and in collinear calculation as well .",
    "we have also investigated other possible choices ( see subsection  [ updfs ] ) .",
    "our calculation of the hard matrix elements includes @xmath1 and @xmath0 production in association with all possible quark - antiquark channels in gluon gluon fusion .",
