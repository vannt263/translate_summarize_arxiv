    "the interaction of interstellar neutral particles with ambient plasma near the boundary between heliospheric and interstellar material ( the heliopause ) is of fundamental importance to the structure of the heliosphere .",
    "the length scale of the coupling between the neutral and plasma populations is on the order of 100 au , which is much larger than the characteristic plasma scales in the magnetic barrier at the heliopause .",
    "this allows the neutrals to decouple from the plasma , penetrate the barrier , and alter the heliospheric environment . indeed , excluding planetary atmospheres",
    ", @xmath198% of the diffuse gas in the heliosphere originates in the surrounding interstellar cloud ( sic ) .",
    "the shock structure in the outer heliosphere consists of the termination shock ( ts ) where the solar wind goes from supersonic to subsonic , the heliopause ( hp ) , which is the stagnation surface between deflecting interstellar ions and hot subsonic solar wind plasma , and the possible bow shock ( bs ) where the interstellar flow goes from supersonic to subsonic .",
    "heliospheric models with both a termination shock and bow shock are referred to as `` two - shock '' models , while models where the interstellar flow is subsonic are commonly referred to as `` one - shock '' models ( no bow shock ) .",
    "the difference lies in the strength of the restoring forces that respond to plasma compression in the sic .",
    "the characteristic properties of the sic have been determined from a combination of observations of nearby stars , observations of pick - up ions in the solar system , and direct observations of interstellar neutral helium at 5 au ( piskunov _ et al .",

    "on the other hand , elementary estimates of the local interstellar medium ( lism ) parameters that include cosmic - ray pressure suggest that the interstellar flow may be subsonic ( zank _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a , b ) .",
    "also , the possibility that the bow shock may be smoothed out by ion - neutral effects in the presence of the interstellar magnetic field , giving rise to an effective one - shock model , has been suggested ( mullan & arge 1995 ) .",
    "independent of these considerations , when interstellar neutrals are included self - consistently , the neutral flow across the heliopause region is always seen to be compressed , heated , and decelerated in the nose region upstream of the heliopause . however , since the detailed structure of the compressed region , referred to as the `` hydrogen wall '' , varies considerably between one- and two - shock models , the availability of sensitive diagnostics of this region would offer a powerful probe of the global structure of the heliosphere .",

    "this conclusion was based on two _ copernicus _ and eight _ iue _ spectra acquired over a period of four years .",
    "they interpreted the velocity offset as evidence for two clouds in this sightline .",
    "lw repeated the observation with the greatly improved spectral resolution of the ghrs echelle a , and found evidence for at least two separate structures , one with the expected lism properties and the other more redshifted component with a possible hydrogen pile - up at our heliosphere .",
    "they also explored the possibility that a third , _ blueshifted _ component associated with the asterosphere of @xmath0 cen might be present in the data .",
    "other interpretations may be possible , but the overall redshift of the h absorption could not be created by any known interstellar cloud in the line of sight ( lallement _ et al .",
    "the possible presence of a heated conductive interface along the line of sight is also an unlikely interpretation , as argued in appendix a. thus , the goal here is to critically explore the interpretation that this redshifted feature is due to decelerated neutral hydrogen at the heliosphere , using detailed models which include recent advances in heliospheric physics .",
    "we first show the lw observations in figure 1 , and describe our approach for isolating the possible heliospheric signature .",
    "the solid curves in figure 1 are the observed profiles for @xmath0 cen a ( figure 1a ) and @xmath0 cen b ( figure 1b ) .",
    "the wavelength scale in both figures is relative to l@xmath0 line center in the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "note that the conversion to a velocity scale is given by 0.1  = 25 km / s .",
    "the chromospheric emission lines show two obvious foreground absorption features , a wide and saturated feature due primarily to absorption by interstellar neutral h , and a narrow unsaturated feature due to absorption by interstellar deuterium . in order to determine the amount of absorption",
    ", the intrinsic stellar emission profile must be specified .",
    "we start with assumed intrinsic profiles shown as dashed lines in figure 1 .",
    "the true profiles are not known for either star , although @xmath0 cen a has the same spectral type ( g2 v ) as the sun .",
    "the secondary @xmath0 cen b is also a dwarf , though is substantially cooler ( k1 v ) .",
    "our approach is to take the intrinsic solar l@xmath0 profile ( brekke _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) and rescale it linearly in both wavelength and intensity to fit the wings of the observed profiles . for the conclusions of our paper , an accurate representation of the intrinsic stellar profile",
    "is not required , since the features in which we are ultimately interested are quite sharp , representing absorption that varies dramatically over a frequency interval that is comparable to the doppler width in the stellar l@xmath0-forming region .",
    "any scheme for generating plausible profiles that vary only gradually over such a narrow interval would be acceptable .",
    "the next step is to model the interstellar attenuation , so that any residual absorption isolates the potential heliospheric signal .",
    "the dotted curves in figure 1 give the attenuation of the stellar emission by an interstellar cloud with neutral column depth @xmath20 @xmath21 , velocity @xmath22 km / s , and doppler broadening @xmath23 km / s .",
    "these values are taken from the lw paper . here",
    "@xmath24 was fixed by scaling to the deuterium column density @xmath25 assuming d / h = @xmath26 .",
    "this d / h value is supported by downstream observations ( away from the heliospheric hydrogen wall ) toward capella ( linsky et al .",
    "1993 ) , and is consistent with similar data in all directions ( wood et al .",
    "( in  6 , we discuss the effects of modifying the assumed d / h ratio . )",
    "figure 1 shows clearly that additional absorption both redward and blueward of the main interstellar feature is required to complete the fit .",
    "also , the additional absorption must be applied preferentially to the redward side , so even if we arbitrarily increased the assumed ratio of h to d , a fit could not be achieved .",
    "lw and frisch _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) interpreted the redshifted absorption as a distinct component associated with the heliosphere .",
    "( 1996 ) used early models by zank _",
    "( 1996b ) to model the heliospheric feature ; our goal here is to apply recent models that include an advanced treatment of neutral / plasma coupling in the heliosphere for our calculation of the expected l@xmath0 absorption .",
    "l@xmath0 absorption from neutral hydrogen that has been heated and decelerated in the region upstream of the heliopause provides a useful probe of the physics in the heliospheric boundary layers . prior to calculating the absorption signature from detailed models , however , it is useful to explore in a general way the effect of a neutral interstellar / heliosphere interface on incident l@xmath0 profiles . to do this",
    ", we consider the absorption for constant values of the broadening speed @xmath27 and velocity @xmath28 over a specified column density @xmath29 .",
    "since the column density of the hydrogen wall is expected to be @xmath30 @xmath21 ( zank _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , the extended lorentz wings of heliospheric hydrogen can not accumulate any appreciable opacity , so we restrict our analysis to the doppler core .",
    "the optical depth of the h@xmath13 pile - up is then @xmath31 where @xmath28 and @xmath27 are in km / s ( and negative @xmath28 corresponds to motion toward the sun ) , and @xmath32 is in  from line center in the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "the narrow absorption domain of interest in figure 1 appears in the vicinity of + 0.1  , corresponding to a sub - population moving at + 25 km / s away from the sun .",
    "lw found they could achieve a reasonable fit to the profile in this domain using @xmath33 @xmath21 , @xmath34 km / s , and @xmath35 km / s , where we have averaged their results for @xmath0 cen a and b when there were slight differences . using these parameters , eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) yields @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "thus , a simple constraint we can impose is that any heliospheric model invoked to explain this absorption feature must yield an optical depth of roughly unity at @xmath37 in the heliocentric frame .    since the column depth of the hydrogen wall is three orders of magnitude smaller than the column depth in the lism toward @xmath0 cen , it may be surprising at first glance that the heliospheric optical depth at + 0.1  is of the same order as the lism optical depth at that wavelength .",
    "the key difference is that the neutral flow into the hydrogen wall is heated and decelerated ( and/or deflected ) , which both broadens and redshifts the heliospheric component away from the -0.07  centroid of the lism absorption and toward the + 0.1  wavelength of interest .    to compare the relative importance of the temperature increase and the velocity shift in allowing the hydrogen wall to be visible , we find simply from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) that decelerating the projected velocity of the hydrogen wall along the @xmath0 cen sightline by an additional 1 km / s ( from -8 km / s to -7 km / s ) has the same effect as increasing the temperature by 2300 k ( if @xmath27 is purely thermal , so that @xmath38 ) .",
    "each would increase the optical depth by 15% .",
    "since the lw @xmath28 is redshifted by 10 km / s relative to the lism , and heated by about @xmath39 k , crudely extrapolating the above analysis suggests that each of these effects contributes about equally toward making the hydrogen wall visible .",
    "however , the nonlinear response to temperature rapidly becomes important as the temperature falls , and eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) indicates that @xmath40 falls by a factor of 5 if @xmath27 is reduced to 16 km / s , corresponding to @xmath41 k. for this reason , in the numerical results below , the temperature is the parameter that shows the most significant variations .",
    "the velocity and column depth structure also vary from model to model , however , and they too affect the profiles .",
    "although heuristic models illustrate the overall hydrogen wall characteristics , the value of l@xmath0 diagnostics is that they are sensitive to the details of the heliospheric physics . in this paper",
    "we apply such models , which include recent advances in heliospheric simulation .",
    "the lism inflow parameters in the three models are summarized in table 1 , and the details of the simulations are given in the above references .",
    "models 1 and 2 are drawn from previous work ( pauls _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; zank _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a , b ) , and model 3 represents new results derived specifically to better fit the ghrs data . for reference , we summarize the three models in appendix b. the hydrogen wall attributes depend on the assumed values of the lism inflow parameters ( see table 1 ) , which include the density of electrons ( @xmath42 ) and neutrals ( @xmath43 ) in the surrounding lism , their temperature @xmath44 ( assumed equal ) , the speed ( @xmath45 ) of heliospheric motion relative to the lism , and the ratio of @xmath45 to the propagation speed of pressure disturbances in the plasma .",
    "this last parameter , the mach number , is critical for determining the qualitative hydrodynamic response .",
    "it depends on the pressure , which here is defined as the thermal proton pressure times a correction factor @xmath0 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the proton density and @xmath48 is the proton temperature .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 ( see table 1 ) accounts not only for the electron pressure , but also for any added contribution from cosmic ray pressure or a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "thus for a pure hydrogen plasma with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 as in model 1 .",
    "the higher @xmath0 values in models 2 and 3 imply additional contributions which increase the effective sound speed , given by @xmath52 measured in km / s , where @xmath53 is the adiabatic index and @xmath54 is the proton mass .",
    "the increase in mean atomic mass from helium and other species is not included , but would simply alter @xmath0 accordingly .",
    "the plasma mach number governs the qualitative behavior of the heliosheath , and is thus a key discriminant when considering the l@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the higher the mach number , the greater the visible absorption , due to the elevation of the temperature of the wall ( cf .",
    "the heating of the plasma occurs not only due to adiabatic compression , but also to charge exchange , which passes an electron from a neutral to a proton .",
    "this important process transports energy across the magnetic boundary between heliospheric and lism plasma , because neutrals are not deflected by the magnetic field .",
    "they may therefore cross the boundary freely and charge - exchange on the other side , creating a neutral population with the attributes of the plasma .",
    "they may then return across the boundary and charge - exchange again , and the net effect is to couple the partially ionized plasmas across the magnetic barrier , as discussed in more detail in appendix b.    this process is especially significant for the heliosphere because the termination shock strongly heats the solar - wind plasma , and charge - exchange with inflowing neutrals allows the transfer of this heat into the plasma in the hydrogen wall region , which in turn is transferred to the neutrals in the hydrogen wall via further charge exchanges . the overall effect is to siphon off some of the solar - wind kinetic energy flux and to deposit it as thermal energy , via three separate charge exchange events , into the hydrogen wall .",
    "higher inflow mach numbers allow this process to occur more efficiently , by allowing a greater penetration of interstellar neutrals into the termination - shock - heated plasma of solar - wind origin .",
    "there is also more adiabatic heating for high mach numbers , all of which serves to elevate the characteristic @xmath55 .    as argued above , elevated temperature in the hydrogen wall",
    "is a key factor in allowing the heliospheric l@xmath0 absorption to be visible beyond the wavelengths saturated by lism absorption .",
    "the other important factors were the deceleration ( or deflection ) of the flow , and the column depth of the wall .",
    "thus for a simple comparison , in table 2 we estimate a representative temperature @xmath55 , line - of - sight speed @xmath28 , and column depth @xmath29 of the hydrogen wall along the 52  sightline for each of the models in table 1 , and give for comparison the lw empirical fit .",
    "owing to gradients , the definition of characteristic values is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we chose the values in table 2 by averaging the parameters at three separate points of interest in the wall .",
    "these three points are where the temperature is maximal , where the velocity is minimal , and where the contribution to the optical depth at the key 0.1   wavelength reaches its peak ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the value of the characteristic width @xmath56 along the 52  sightline is what would be required to accumulate the same optical depth at 0.1   as the actual integrals over the model grid .",
    "the equivalent column depth is then @xmath57 .",
    "also given to provide an overall length scale is the distance to the heliopause in the upstream direction @xmath58 , although the hydrogen wall absorption is not highly sensitive to this model - dependent parameter .    from table 2",
    "it is clear that higher mach numbers yield greater heating of the hydrogen wall .",
    "if this conclusion is borne out by future parameter studies , then the sensitivity of the width of the l@xmath0 absorption to @xmath55 gives an observational constraint on the heliospheric mach number .",
    "in contrast , the characteristic line - of - sight velocity @xmath28 does not vary appreciably for these models , while the equivalent column depth @xmath29 varies as a complicated function of the inflow parameters .",
    "it can also be seen that the simulation results are substantially cooler than the heuristic lw fit , which would tend to yield less l@xmath0 absorption than is observed .",
    "however , this is compensated by the higher amount of deceleration and/or deflection in the simulations , i.e. , a less - negative @xmath28 , which creates a greater redshift of the heliospheric absorption relative to the lism .",
    "this hints at the lack of uniqueness of observational fits , and shows why the inclusion of heliospheric physics is essential .",
    "detailed depictions of the simulation results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the figure is described in detail in appendix b. figures 2a and 2b give 2d plots of log @xmath44 contours , while the shading shows the density distribution , for model 1 ( two - shock ) and model 2 ( one - shock ) respectively .",
    "figures 2c - e give line plots of the density , velocity , and temperature , respectively , along the @xmath0 cen line of sight , where the dashed curve is model 1 , dotted is model 2 , and dot - dashed is model 3 .",
    "note the more gradual compression and deflection of the neutral flow in the one - shock models , and the reduced peak temperature of the wall , compared to the two - shock model 1 .",
    "we are now ready to compare the detailed spectral features resulting from these various models with the actual observations , thereby learning about the possible structure of our heliosphere .",
    "the results are intended to be informative but not definitive , as a complete study over the full range of plausible plasma and neutral inflow parameters , and their application to multiple sightlines , is still needed .",
    "this computationally demanding task is in progress .",
    "here we demonstrate that the warm h@xmath13 piled up against the heliopause can not be ignored when interpreting lyman @xmath0 data toward nearby stars in the upstream hemisphere .",
    "the calculation of l@xmath0 absorption by each model involves the straightforward application of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) , using the local values at each gridpoint , and integrating over column depth along the @xmath0 cen sightline ( 52  from the upstream direction ) .",
    "the model grid extends to 1000 au from the sun , where the assumed intrinsic profile corrected for lism absorption over a voigt profile is incident as a boundary condition .",
    "the assumed lism parameters , adapted from lw , are column depth @xmath59 @xmath21 , doppler broadening @xmath60 km / s , and line - of - sight velocity @xmath61 km / s .",
    "the values of @xmath62 and @xmath45 are well constrained by observations of other interstellar absorption lines toward @xmath0 cen , and the effects of varying @xmath24 are considered in  7 .",
    "figure 3 shows the l@xmath0 absorption at the red edge of the lism feature , for each of the heliospheric models listed in table 1 .",
    "this can be compared directly with the ghrs data from lw ( solid curve ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra are convolved with the instrumental broadening of the ghrs echelle a , which we take as a gaussian of width 0.008  , though this correction is not essential for our purposes .",
    "the figure 3a/3b results refer to the @xmath0 cen a / b data respectively .",
    "additional absorption at the blue edge is explained below .",
    "the key discriminant of the h@xmath13 pile - up is the quality of the fit at the red edge of the absorption trough , between about 0.05 and 0.15  from heliocentric line center , where the decelerated component is visible outside of the saturated part of the interstellar line .",
    "the sloping absorption wings redward of this can be fitted with relatively minor adjustments to the assumed intrinsic stellar profile , so are not diagnostically significant . comparing the results of models 13 with the observations demonstrates the following points , all of which are robustly insensitive to the uncertainties in the intrinsic profile .",
    "( i ) heliospheric l@xmath0 absorption in the supersonic model ( model 1 ) is _ too strong _ due to the stronger deceleration and especially the increase in temperature of the interstellar neutrals in the hydrogen wall .",
    "( ii ) heliospheric l@xmath0 absorption in the subsonic model with low mach number ( model 2 ) is _ too weak _ , since the more gradually diverted interstellar plasma flow leads to less deceleration and less heating of the interstellar neutrals .",
    "( iii ) the model with a barely subsonic mach number of 0.9 ( model 3 ) and a larger plasma density ( see table 1 ) does yield a favorable fit , giving compression and charge - exchange heating of the neutrals intermediate between the results of models 1 and 2 .",
    "the consistency with ghrs data given by the parameters of model 3 should not be expected to be unique , and other combinations could also suffice .",
    "however , we strongly suspect that the incident interstellar gas flow can be neither highly supersonic nor highly subsonic , since these scenarios lead rather inevitably to l@xmath0 absorption that is either too strong or too weak respectively . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that a barely subsonic interstellar wind provides the proper degree of both deceleration and heating of the neutrals to fit the data .",
    "the detailed constraints on the interstellar mach number and inflow density imposed by these data will be explored in future models .",
    "figure 3 also explores the cause of excess absorption on the blue edge of the saturated lism feature , by following the lw speculation that it is due at least partially to the joint asterosphere of @xmath0 cen a and b. at the level of a plausibility argument only , we assumed that the @xmath0 cen asterosphere was identical to the heliosphere ( i.e. , models 1 , 2 , 3 respectively ) , but viewed from the appropriate angle ( 80  from the interstellar inflow direction ) .",
    "this assumption is certainly not strictly warranted , but there are some similarities in the two systems , since @xmath0 cen a is a solar twin and the @xmath0 cen star system has a relative velocity with respect to its prevailing interstellar cloud of 22 km / s , similar to the sun .",
    "note that absorption by the solar hydrogen wall is seen only at the red edge of the lism feature , and similarly for the alpha cen hydrogen wall at the blue edge , so that the two sides of the absorption profile are linked only by the assumed lism attributes .",
    "the schematic @xmath0 cen absorption at the blue edge for models 1 , 2 , and 3 is therefore also shown in figure 3 with the same conventions as the heliospheric absorption at the red edge , and again offers promise for an acceptable fit .",
    "this supports the view of lw that the @xmath0 cen asterosphere is detected , and offers exciting possibilities for modeling the wind / lism interaction in this system . of course",
    ", alternative explanations are possible ; for example , we show in appendix a that a cloud interface could mimic a stellar hw for this sightline .    to understand the integrated absorption in terms of its spatial contributions from the local neutral parameters over the grid , figure 4",
    "shows the contribution to the optical depth at 0.1    compiled over 100 au intervals . since the area under the curves gives the integrated optical depth at the key wavelength 0.1  it provides a proxy for the overall impact of the heliosphere on the observed l@xmath0 profiles .",
    "the importance of h@xmath13 heating in producing observable hydrogen - wall absorption is evident since the region of greatest temperature ( figure 2e ) correlates with the region of maximum contribution to the optical depth .",
    "observations along the single @xmath0 cen sightline yields valuable yet limited information about the inferred mach number of solar motion through the lism . data from sightlines that cross the hydrogen wall along other angles would be extremely helpful for confirming the heliospheric origin of the absorption , and would provide additional constraints on the heliospheric parameters .",
    "lism column depths substantially above @xmath63 @xmath21 completely blanket the wavelength domain where heliospheric absorption could have appreciable opacity , therefore useful l@xmath0 sources are scarce . even if some starlight penetrates at wavelengths of heliospheric absorption , the bandwidth of the signal may be too narrow to be spectrally resolved .",
    "the purpose of this section is to derive the equivalent width of the l@xmath0 heliospheric absorption for a given model , to determine the usefulness of a given stellar source as a heliospheric probe , as a function of lism column depth and instrumental resolution .",
    "the estimate is obtained by assuming a flat stellar spectrum incident on the lism cloud with values @xmath23 and @xmath64 cos @xmath65 km / s ( taken from lw ) , where @xmath65 is the angle from the upstream direction , and the column depth @xmath24 is treated as a variable . the stellar spectrum transmitted through the lism , as a function of @xmath24 , then provides the input for the calculation of the heliospheric absorption feature , for which we compute an equivalent width as a function of @xmath24 . if the absorption is significant at any wavelength , this equivalent width gives a conservative estimate of the wavelength resolution required to clearly distinguish the feature .",
    "the equivalent widths of the model heliospheric absorption are plotted as contours in figure 5 , as a function of @xmath24 for each sightline , for heliospheric models 1 and 2 ( shown in figure 5a and 5b respectively ) .",
    "model 3 is intermediate to these results .",
    "the value of @xmath24 that corresponds to each point on a given contour is the radial distance from the origin , measured by the scale given on the abscissa and ordinate .",
    "the angle of the sightline from the upstream direction maps directly into the angle from the abscissa , so the figure represents orientations and column depths in real space with the heliosphere at the origin .",
    "the sightlines to 36 oph , @xmath0 cen , and 31 com would be at @xmath66 12 , 52 , and 72  respectively , and are indicated .",
    "the absorption equivalent widths are measured in  .",
    "it is expected that observed resolution elements somewhat larger than the absorption equivalent widths in the figure may still be valuable if the signal - to - noise is high , so the contours merely provide guidelines for the preferred degree of resolution to guarantee useful diagnostics .    as an example , the resolution of the ghrs echelle a corresponds to a gaussian doppler width of @xmath10.008   at l@xmath0 . according to figure 5",
    ", this means that along the sightline to @xmath0 cen , the heliospheric absorption can be resolved easily for lism columns below about @xmath67 @xmath21 and @xmath68 @xmath21 for the one - shock and two - shock models respectively . as another example , by interpolating for model 3 along the sightline to 31 com we conclude that the heliosphere should be easily resolvable to the ghrs echelle for intervening column densities of n@xmath69@xmath70 @xmath21 . since the interstellar @xmath24 column toward 31 com is indeed around @xmath70 @xmath21 ( piskunov , wood , & linsky 1996 ) , this illustrates the potential value of searching for heliospheric h@xmath13 absorption in high - resolution l@xmath0 observations of stars other than @xmath0 cen . at the time of this writing , an unpublished analysis of the l@xmath0 absorption toward 31 com by dring _",
    "( 1997 ) was unable to identify a clearly heliospheric absorption component .",
    "the quantitative constraints this imposes on the heliosphere are still being examined , but will presumably provide further evidence against strongly supersonic plasma inflow .",
    "since our fundamental constraint for distinguishing between one - shock and two - shock models is the degree of excess absorption illuminated by starlight transmitted by the lism , the lism hydrogen column is crucial to specify .",
    "this is done by scaling to the easily inferred deuterium column , assuming that the d / h ratio takes the value that is canonical in the solar neighborhood along various other sightlines ( piskunov , wood , & linsky 1996 ) , which is @xmath71 ( by particle , not mass ) .    however , if this ratio varies in the lism , and were to be lower along the @xmath0 cen sightline , then the additional lism hydrogen absorption would require less heliospheric absorption , favoring models with an even lower mach number .",
    "indeed , if d / h were to be so low as a factor @xmath13 , then the _ one - shock _ model 2 results fit both edges of the absorption extremely well , and no contribution from absorption by the @xmath0 cen hydrogen wall would be required toward the blue .",
    "contrarily , _ increasing _ d / h by an order of magnitude , however implausible , would move the _ two - shock _ model 1 results into better agreement , and the @xmath0 cen wall would then also have to contribute more strongly .",
    "this implies a connection between the assumed d / h ratio and the best - fit heliospheric model .",
    "therefore , a variety of heliospheric models could be consistent with the data , but only if the d / h ratio can be varied by about an order of magnitude .",
    "since our conclusions are insensitive to small variations in d / h , it is apparent that constraint information travels more easily in the direction from knowledge about d / h into knowledge about the heliosphere , rather than the converse . with the inclusion of future observations along other lines of sight through the hydrogen wall",
    ", a suitable synthesis between the observational ramifications of both d / h and heliospheric absorption can be achieved , and confidence in a stable upstream d / h ratio may be further established . in light of the cosmological significance of d",
    "/ h , this represents a rather unique interplay between heliospheric and astronomical areas of interest .",
    "we have shown that high spectral resolution observations of l@xmath0 absorption , coupled with careful modeling of the interaction of the solar wind with the lism , provide a useful diagnostic for remotely sampling the global structure of the heliosphere .",
    "our conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) several models ( baranov & malama 1993 ; pauls _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; zank _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a , b ) have independently corroborated the theoretical expectation that warmed interstellar neutrals should accumulate upstream of the heliopause .",
    "our synthetic absorption profiles for three distinct heliospheric models support the detection of this hydrogen wall toward @xmath0 cen by landsman _",
    "et al . _ ( 1984 ) and lw , and our barely subsonic model ( mach number 0.9 ) closely resembles the observations .",
    "we conclude that the hydrogen wall upstream of our heliosphere has indeed been seen . a particularly promising avenue for concretely confirming this conclusion is to combine the @xmath0 cen data with archival high - resolution l@xmath0 spectra of 31 com , since this would provide stereoscopic sampling of the heliosphere at angles @xmath72 and @xmath73 from the upstream direction .",
    "\\(ii ) our model results indicate that the differences between a one- and two - shock heliosphere manifest themselves in observably distinct l@xmath0 absorption features , providing a powerful discriminant between these possibilities .",
    "furthermore , application of this diagnostic exerts quantifiable constraints on the plasma and neutral environment in the inaccessible lism .",
    "for example , the lism parameters ( temperature , density , flow speed , and fractionation ) from model 3 , which yield a reasonable fit to the l@xmath0 data , are only in good agreement with existing estimates ( frisch 1995 , gloeckler 1996 ) if we further stipulate that cosmic rays ( or some other mechanism , such as a perpendicular magnetic field ) contribute appreciably to the total interstellar pressure .",
    "the possibility that cosmic rays ( e.g. , holzer 1979 ) or magnetic fields ( e.g. , mullan & arge 1996 ) could serve in this way to reduce the inflow mach number is not unexpected , but since we have yet to undertake a comprehensive study over the full range of possible lism inflow parameters , we can not at present establish the uniqueness of the mach 0.9 fit .",
    "complementary observations , such as backscattered solar l@xmath0 from neutrals in the heliosphere , may provide invaluable additional constraints , since the fwhm is sensitive to the neutral heating .",
    "thus although our results are highly suggestive , conclusive evidence of subsonic inflow awaits future work .",
    "\\(iii ) models that include the charge - exchange coupling between plasma and neutrals have established the importance of a process , described in detail by zank _",
    "( 1996a ) and zank & pauls ( 1996 ) , whereby interstellar neutrals that charge exchange with very hot shocked solar wind plasma ( i.e. , the `` component 2 '' neutrals described in appendix b ) subsequently stream out into the lism .",
    "although of low density ( @xmath74 @xmath3 ) , these neutrals are very hot ( @xmath75 k ) , and after a second charge - exchange process , deposit considerable heat into the plasma just outside the heliopause .",
    "this temperature increase acts to further heat the hydrogen wall via subsequent charge exchanges .",
    "the potent combination of heating and deceleration produces visible absorption in the l@xmath0 spectra from @xmath0 cen , and this absorption becomes more pronounced as the peak temperature increases .",
    "models which neglect heat transport across the heliopause via charge exchange can not produce the proper l@xmath0 opacity profile .",
    "furthermore , the evidence that hydrogen - wall absorption is indeed clearly visible implies that some such heating mechanism must indeed be operating , which supports this hitherto purely theoretical picture .",
    "\\(iv ) although the blueshifted absorption excess has not received close attention here , it was found that if @xmath0 cen has a relatively solar - like asterosphere , then its hydrogen wall should also be visible .",
    "this supports the suggested detection of an @xmath0 cen hydrogen wall by lw , and opens new possibilities for constraining models of the wind / lism interaction in this nearby stellar system .",
    "gpz and hlp were supported in part by nasa grants nagw-2076 , nagw-3450 , nsf young investigator award atm-9357861 , and a jet propulsion laboratory contract 959167 .",

    "jeffrey linsky in this project .",

    "jon slavin for providing the opacity profile for warm neutral hydrogen expected in the interface between the local interstellar cloud and surrounding hot plasma .",
    "the computations were performed in part on the cray - ymp at the san diego supercomputer center .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss other potential sources of excess l@xmath0 absorption that could mimic a heliospheric feature , and argue that , although other possibilities can not be competely ruled out , none provide as natural and theoretically straightforward an explanation as the hydrogen wall . since landsman et al .",
    "( 1984 ) concluded that the observed @xmath76 km / s offset between the centroids of the h@xmath77 absorption and the d@xmath77 absorption could not be explained by uncertainties in the underlying stellar emission profile , and linsky & wood ( 1996b ) ruled out uncertainties due to geocoronal emission , we must conclude that the foreground l@xmath0 absorption is intrinsically complex . since the h@xmath77 l@xmath0 optical depth of the lism feature lies on the saturated part of the `` curve of growth '' , whereas the lism d@xmath77 and the allegedly heliospheric h@xmath77 features lie in the unsaturated linear domain , the centroid of the @xmath78 absorption could be sufficiently shifted relative to the d@xmath77 if there exists a subset of material that is optically thick in h@xmath77 but not in d@xmath77 . since this",
    "roughly 8 km / s offset is caused by h@xmath77 absorption near 0.1   ( + 25 km / s relative to the lism ) , such small column depths could only be effective if a component exists that has a bulk velocity shift of this magnitude , or if the velocity dispersion approaches 25 km / s within a component that is itself shifted by at least 8 km / s , or some combination of the two .",
    "such a dispersion can not be accomplished by overlapping pieces of observed lism bulk flows , since the velocity difference between the main component toward @xmath0 cen and the sic ( also called the lic ) clouds is only @xmath79 km / s in this line of sight ( lallement _ et al .",
    "therefore , we must either assume that this velocity dispersion is achieved at the atomic level via warming of a small fraction of the foreground material to temperatures of at least about 20,000 k , or postulate the existence of thin `` wisps '' moving at speeds around 25 km / s relative to the bulk of the lism .",
    "there is no evidence in favor of the existence of fast - moving wisps , so we focus on possible absorption due to the warm interfaces speculated on more physical grounds to exist ( slavin 1989 ) between bulk lism clouds and the hot ism plasma filling nearby space . note that a cold component at the sic velocity would not yield sufficient opacity at the wavelengths of interest to affect our conclusions .    in the model of slavin ( 1989 ) ,",
    "the lism interface is a @xmath10.0032 pc layer of h@xmath13 with n(h@xmath13)@xmath13.5 @xmath80 10@xmath81 @xmath21 , @xmath82 8,00080,000 k , and @xmath83 1 km / s with respect to the cloud .",
    "we found that the theoretical velocity distribution of the heated interface neutral h yielded absorption that could be most simiply fit by the sum of the two voigt absorption features ; on with and the other with n(h@xmath13)@xmath11.0 @xmath80 10@xmath81 @xmath21 and @xmath84 km / s , both moving at 0.9 km / s with respect to the underlying cloud from which it is evaporating .",
    "our test model assumes that two such interfaces exist toward @xmath0 cen , one at the edge of the main cloud toward @xmath0 cen ( -19.1 km / s ) , and the other at the edge of the local ( sic ) cloud ( at -15.5 km / s ) . the thermal broadening and total column depth of a warm slavin interface for each cloud",
    "are similar to the heliopause models , and potentially difficult to distinguish",
    ". however , such interfaces do not yield sufficient velocity offset between the observed h@xmath77 and @xmath85 features .",
    "we added two hypothetical interfaces to the lw lism absorption without any heliospheric component , and obtain the results shown in figure 6 .",
    "we conclude that the presence of slavin interfaces would affect observed lism l@xmath0 absorption and could complicate the interpretation of the heliospheric signal , although a heliospheric contribution would still be required to yield the observed redshift .",
    "thus , the possibility that the heliospheric signal could be blended with warm ism structures remains open , but there is presently no consistent evidence that this is the case .",
    "two groups have developed detailed models of the interaction between the solar wind and the lism that include the neutral hydrogen component self - consistently with the plasma .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) monte carlo approach has been pioneered by baranov and malama ( 1993 , 1995 ) , while pauls et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996a , b ) , zank et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) , and williams et al .",
    "( 1996a , b , all summarized in zank & pauls 1996 ) , have instead chosen a multi - fluid approach to describe the neutral hydrogen .",
    "both yield similar results for identical input parameters , although the simulations of the latter group have recently been extended to three dimensions ( pauls & zank , 1996b ) .",
    "these latter models are also time dependent , but approach a nearly steady state . since the details are described in the above references , we present here only an overview of the salient features of the 2d multi - fluid models we utilize for our analysis of the l@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the key physical process responsible for altering the dynamics of interstellar h@xmath13 at the heliopause is the coupling to the local plasma via charge exchange , whereby the bound electron from a neutral is passed to a proton during collision without any other effect , thus swapping the neutral and proton attributes . to avoid solving the neutral boltzmann equation directly to describe this interaction ,",
    "we recognize that , to a good approximation , there exist essentially three distinct neutral h components ( holzer 1972 ; hall 1993 ) corresponding to three physically distinct regions of origin .",
    "neutral h atoms whose source lies beyond the heliosphere ( region 1 ) are component 1 .",
    "this `` thermal '' neutral component is thus interstellar in origin , although dynamical changes in the distribution result from charge exchange with interstellar plasma which has been significantly affected by the presence of the heliosphere .",
    "by contrast , neutral component 2 , which is born via charge exchange in the solar - wind shock - heated heliosheath and heliotail ( region 2 ) , is suprathermal compared to component 1 , its high temperature reflecting that of the local @xmath86 k plasma .",
    "although of low density , component 2 can be dynamically important owing to its ability to transport heat across the heliopause . the third ( `` splash '' ) component is produced in the cold supersonic solar wind prior to reaching the termination shock ( region 3 ) , and this very tenuous component is characterized by high radially outward velocities .",
    "each of these three neutral components is represented by a distinct maxwellian distribution function appropriate to the characteristics of the source distribution .",
    "this then allows us to simplify the production and loss terms corresponding to each neutral component ( ripken & fahr 1973 ; zank _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a ; williams _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a ) .",
    "the complete highly non - maxwellian h distribution function is then the sum over the three components , i.e. , @xmath87 equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) allows us to express the full boltzmann equation for the neutrals as distinct equations corresponding to each of components 1 , 2 and 3 , all coupled through their respective production and loss terms . from each of these component boltzmann equations ,",
    "one obtains a distinct isotropic hydrodynamic description for each of the three neutral components .",
    "thus , our multi - fluid description comprises all three neutral fluids coupled to a hydrodynamic plasma .",
    "this rather computationally demanding time - dependent system of equations is solved in two spatial dimensions using a method developed by pauls et al .",

    "the ts is located at @xmath89 au and    @xmath91 au respectively .",
    "( ii ) : :    inflowing component 1 neutrals are decelerated substantially and    filtered by charge exchange with the interstellar plasma between the    bs and hp in the upstream direction , which leads to the formation of a    hydrogen wall with densities up to about @xmath92    @xmath3 , column depths up to about @xmath93    @xmath94 , and temperatures ranging from 20,000 k to    30,000 k. the pile - up in the neutral gas results from the deceleration    and deflection of the neutral flow by charge exchange with the    interstellar plasma , which is itself decelerated and diverted due to    the presence of the heliosphere .",
    "( iii ) : :    component 2 , produced via charge exchange between component 1 and hot    shocked solar wind plasma between the ts and hp , leaks across the hp    into the cooler shocked interstellar gas and heats the plasma through    a _ second _ charge exchange .",
    "this leads to an extended thermal foot    abutting the outside edge of the hp .",
    "this heating of the plasma by    component 2 serves to broaden the region between the bs and hp , as    well as to ( indirectly ) further heat the component 1 interstellar    neutrals after _ subsequent _ charge exhanges .",
    "some minor heating of the    unshocked lism also occurs upstream of the bs , thereby marginally    reducing the mach number of the incident interstellar wind .",
    "( iv ) : :    the temperature of component 1 neutrals once inside the heliosphere    remains fairly constant in the upstream region , at    @xmath82 20,000 k , a substantial increase over the assumed    lism temperature of 10,900 k assumed for model 1 . a further increase    in the component 1",
    "temperature occurs in the downstream region .",
    "( v ) : :    the number density of component 1 crossing the ts is @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "this is approximately half the assumed    incident lism number density , an effect termed `` filtration '' . between    the ts and 10 au from the sun in the upstream region",
    ", this density    varies only weakly , following a rough power law    ( @xmath97 , with @xmath98 the heliospheric    radius ) . in the downstream direction ,",
    "component 1 densities are lower    within the heliosphere and the gradient is somewhat steeper , with    density increasing as @xmath99 .",
    "( vi ) : :    the upstream neutral gas is decelerated from @xmath100 km / s in    the lism to @xmath101 km / s at the ts in the region of the    nose .",
    "deflection of the flow also reduces the radial velocity    component at angles away from the nose .",
    "( vii ) : :    zank _ et al . _",
    "( 1996a ) point out the possibility that the hp is time    dependent due to an inwardly directed ion - neutral drag term which    provides an effective `` gravitational '' term for a stratified fluid    ( which then introduces the possibility of rayleigh - taylor - like    instabilities ) .",
    "the time scale of 180 years and the    @xmath102 au amplitude of the oscillation suggest that this    is unlikely to be important .      as described in the introduction ,",
    "since the sic plasma thermal sound speed is thought to be @xmath114 km / s , and the relative sun - sic velocity is @xmath126 km / s , a two - shock heliosphere is often assumed to be necessary ( baranov _ et al .",
    "_ 1971 ) . however , this neglects the effects of restoring forces due to magnetic or cosmic - ray pressure , which could enhance the effective sound speed .",
    "unfortunately , current knowledge of either the local interstellar magnetic field or cosmic ray pressure is rudimentary . the nominal interstellar pressure contributed by cosmic rays ( ip & axford 1985 ) is @xmath103 dyne @xmath21 ( which gives @xmath1047200 @xmath3 k ) with perhaps @xmath105 dyne @xmath21 contributed by cosmic rays of energy less than about 300 mev per nucleon , which may be expected to couple to the plasma on heliospheric scales .",
    "unfortunately , these estimates are uncertain , particularly at mev energies .",
    "but it is important to note that a cosmic ray pressure of @xmath106 dyne @xmath21 , combined with the interstellar plasma thermal pressure from table 1 ( @xmath107 dyne @xmath21 ) yields a total pressure of @xmath108 dyne @xmath21 ( or @xmath1043600 @xmath3 k ) .",
    "this would be sufficient to increase the lism sound speed to @xmath109 km / s and force the lism inflow to be barely subsonic .",
    "alternatively , a magnetic field strength of 3 @xmath110 g with n@xmath111=0.05 @xmath3 gives an alfven speed of @xmath112=29 km / s , which would enhance the magnetosonic speed and also invalidate a two - shock model .    in view of the comments above",
    ", we also consider models with subsonic lism flow , which will not have a bow shock and therefore may resemble the parker ( 1963 ) model . for model 2 , we again take n@xmath111=0.07 @xmath3 , n@xmath113=0.14 @xmath3 , and t=10,900 k ( see table 1 ) for consistency with model 1 , but a larger `` effective '' temperature is used in determining the pressure , to account for the added contribution from cosmic rays ( and perhaps the magnetic field ) .",
    "this effective temperature is defined in terms of a parameter @xmath0 , as defined above .",
    "the value @xmath114 , shown in table 1 , has been chosen for model 2 , so the upstream mach number is reduced from 1.5 ( as in model 1 ) to 0.7 .",
    "no charge exchange is assumed to occur between the cosmic rays and neutrals due to the former s low number density .",

    "figure 2c - e shows @xmath0 cen line - of - sight profiles for the density , velocity and temperature of component 1 , using dotted curves for model 2 .",
    "again , we merely summarize the main features here ( and see zank _",
    "1996a for further details ) .    *",
    "( i ) * : :    although a bow shock is absent , some adiabatic compression of the    incident interstellar flow is evident .",
    "this gradual compression forms    a lower amplitude hydrogen wall that is more extended in the radial    direction .",
    "it is also less extended in the tangential direction    because of the localized nature of the adiabatic compression .",
    "the    density of the wall in the upstream direction is only    @xmath115 @xmath3 ( though still larger    than the incident lism n@xmath113=0.14    @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , because it is wider , its column    density is comparable to the two - shock case . *",
    "( ii ) * : :    the heliosphere is less distorted along the axis of symmetry than for    the two - shock case , and is smaller due to the higher assumed lism    pressure . *",
    "( iii ) * : :    in the vicinity of the nose , the number density of component 1 flowing    across the ts is @xmath116 @xmath96 with a velocity of    @xmath117 km / s , almost identical to the two - shock model . *",
    "( iv ) * : :    since the h wall has a smaller transverse extent than the two - shock    model , it is less pronounced along the sidestream sightline .",
    "this may    allow the one- and two - shcok models to be observably different not    only upstream , but sidestream as well . *",
    "( v ) * : :    the upstream and downstream temperature characteristics of the    heliospheric component 1 differ significantly between the one- and    two - shock models . in the upstream direction of the one - shock model ,    @xmath12,000 k of cooling for the neutrals is predicted .",
    "a    temperature asymmetry between upstream and downstream heliospheric    neutrals is again present , but the downstream temperatures are    markedly lower than predicted by the two shock model .      to bridge the gap between models 1 and 2 ,",
    "we have computed a third model in which the inflow mach number was chosen to take the intermediate value 0.9 ( model 3 , table 1 ) . in the interest of increased realism ,",
    "at the cost of sacrificing consistency with models 1 and 2 , we reduced the inflow temperature to the more realistic value @xmath118 k , and to compensate we increased the plasma density slightly to n@xmath111=0.1 @xmath3 so as to preserve the incident plasma heat flux .",
    "further variations in the densities would be required to span the observably allowable domain , but this is left for future work , the present paper being restricted to the three models in table 1 .",
    "the model 3 results for the component 1 neutrals are depicted by dot - dashed curves in figure 2c - e .",
    "the overall structure and distribution are similar to model 2 , underscoring the qualitative connection between subsonic models .",
    "the quantitative attributes of the hydrogen wall are generally intermediate to models 1 and 2 , presumably owing to the intermediate value of the mach number , which appears to be the most important single parameter .",
