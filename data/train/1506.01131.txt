    "as known , the original density functional theory ( dft ) is based on hohenberg and kohn prominent work @xcite where they proved that the ground state of any many - electron system is completely characterized by its density and that the energy functional of the system attains its minimum at the density corresponding to the ground state . however , representing the contribution of kinetic energy as density functional has proven to be challenging as the accuracy and applicability of the proposed kinetic energy density functionals ( kedf ) are generally not sufficient @xcite .",
    "alternatively , kohn and sham ( ks - dft ) @xcite suggested an approach where the``orbitals '' are reintroduced where the sum of the orbitals densities equals to the density of the real system and the kinetic energy is defined as the kinetic energy of the introduced `` fictitious '' system .",
    "computational - wise , this results in converting the problem back from 3-dimensional ( 3d ) to 3@xmath0 dimension as @xmath0 orbitals are determined by solving the governing @xmath0 equations self - consistently @xcite , where @xmath0 is the number of the particles . despite this drawback ,",
    "ks - dft nowadays dominates atomistic calculations @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "the work to find an accurate kedf is still active , but modestly . in the recent years",
    ", it starts gaining attention @xcite . to distinguish this dft doctrine from ks - dft which depends on the orbital ,",
    "it is commonly named  orbital - free dft ( of - dft ) @xcite .    since the first independently proposed kedf by thomas @xcite and fermi @xcite ( tf ) , a huge number of kedfs has been suggested .",
    "however , thomas  fermi  model with various corrections dominates the field @xcite .",
    "the usual corrections are either based on gradient expansion @xcite or on adding additional class of kedf @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thomas  fermi - based kedf are used in some applications satisfying the assumption that the density is nearly uniform .",
    "for example , they are used for metals @xcite and warm dense matter @xcite . as for the correction",
    ", it would be assumed abstractly that gradient expansion should pave a reasonable route .",
    "however , it is known that the high order gradient - based corrections diverges for finite systems . therefore , seeking non - gradient - expansion based correction is desirable .",
    "one of the recent corrections suggested by burke and coworkers @xcite is based on uniform wkb analysis in 1-dimensional case .",
    "the addition has neither sums nor derivatives .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new non - gradient based method to enhance the thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation by adding a correction factor derived using an exactly solvable model .",
    "the used model is for @xmath0 non - interacting particles moving in the coulomb field of the nuclear charge .",
    "this allows using the simple rydberg formula to calculate part of the energy and the particle density is expressed in an analytic form through laguerre polynomials and exponential functions .",
    "the correction exploits the fact that the difference between the thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation and the non - interacting kinetic energy is comparable to the difference between the same values inside the proposed solvable model . the concept can be presented best using the following equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the non - interacting kinetic energy and @xmath3 is thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation . in the same equation",
    "we use the notation @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the kinetic energy and thomas - fermi energy of the proposed model .",
    "our work follows a similar approach that was developed to estimate the correlation energy for two - electron atoms @xcite . in our numerical experiments ,",
    "we show that the correction factor can increase the precision of thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation by around an order of magnitude for atoms . to apply it for molecules ,",
    "the method needs further extensions . as shown in ,",
    "the kinetic energy is expressed as thomas ",
    "fermi  energy plus the correction obtained from the exactly solvable model .",
    "we calculated the results numerically for a wide range of atoms up to xenon ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "our results appear to be more accurate in comparison with thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation by a factor between 11 ( for helium ) and 72 for xenon .",
    "we also discuss the large-@xmath7 limit of the energy and the density and compare the correction to those by gradient expansions .",
    "as aforementioned , the general idea of the proposed correction is that the difference between the thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation and the non - interacting kinetic energy is comparable to the difference between the same values inside the proposed solvable model as shown in .",
    "this follows a successful and analogous method used to estimate the correlation energy for two - electron atoms@xcite .",
    "although we assume the model of an @xmath0 non - interacting particles moving in the coulombic field of the nuclear charge , the method can be applied for a wide range of potential models . in this paper , the focus is to present the approach and to illustrate its applicability for simple systems like atoms .",
    "so , we suggest the use of a model that in many respects resemble the atoms and that has an analytical quantum - mechanical solution .",
    "another important reasons for selecting such a model is that it is possible to write the correction @xmath8 as a function of only the electrical charge @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , this form for @xmath4 and @xmath9 provides more in depth understanding of the the model as it will be shown .",
    "since we are interested in an equivalent system of non - interacting particles , the energy @xmath4 does not include correlation effects .",
    "the inter - electron interaction affects the effective potential and therefore the only difference between our model and an atom is disregarding the screening of nuclear charge by inner electrons .",
    "the presented model retains coulomb singularity at the origin , as well as coulomb attraction for large distance , however the attraction force at large distance is much larger in the presented model .",
    "the region of applicability of the thomas  fermi  model , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the chemical potential , is violated in a small region of radius @xmath13 adjoining the nucleus , where quantum effects become significant .",
    "in the neighborhood of the nucleus , the field is practically identical to the coulomb field @xmath14 . in our approach however , we treat the coulomb problem exactly , without considering the quantum corrections separately .    in the assumed model",
    ", we consider a system with the nuclear charge @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the screened coulomb potential for the atom has the same behavior @xmath14 at the origin , but differs far from it . without inter - particle interaction ,",
    "each electron can be considered as occupying an orbital characterized by the principal quantum number @xmath16 . for example , two electrons with @xmath17 in a configuration @xmath18 form the closest inner k - shell ( in x - ray notations ) , eight electrons with @xmath19 form l - shell in a configuration @xmath20 .",
    "generally , a completely filled @xmath21-th shell has @xmath22 electrons with possible quantum numbers @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and spins @xmath25 .",
    "let us denote @xmath26 as the last shell with a non - zero occupation number .",
    "in the ground state , all lowest shells with @xmath27 are completely filled , while the last shell with @xmath28 can be filled either partially or completely . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider initially only the states in closed - shell configurations , i.e. when all shells up to @xmath28 are completely filled . the same model can be extended for other configurations either by considering angular dependence or simply by interpolation between closed shells as it will be shown later .",
    "the total number of electrons on shells with @xmath29 can be obtained by summation of the occupation numbers for each individual shell , @xmath30    the kinetic energy of the proposed model can be calculated by exploiting the kinetic energies for individual orbitals .",
    "this energy for each orbital is given by rydberg formula , that is @xmath31 in atomic units , where @xmath21 is the principal quantum number .",
    "now , the total kinetic energy can be calculated by summation of contributions from each shell , @xmath32 where the kinetic energy of the model @xmath4 corresponds to the same value in .",
    "to fully specify the proposed functional , we also need to calculate the thomas - fermi approximation of energy for the model .",
    "as previously stated , the @xmath5 can be presented as a function of the electrical charge @xmath7 when the proposed model is used . for closed - shell configuration which are spherically symmetric , thomas ",
    "fermi  kinetic energy is @xmath33 where the kedf @xmath34 is @xmath35    to be able to calculate the thomas - fermi approximation using , for the proposed model , it is necessary to have the corresponding electron density @xmath36 . from the definition of the model , we know that @xmath36 can be acquired by combining the wave functions for individual electrons , as follows .",
    "a wavefunction of an electron on the orbital @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a wave function , @xmath21 is the principal quantum number , @xmath40 is an orbital quantum number , @xmath41 is an azimuthal quantum number , @xmath42 is the radius , @xmath43 is a spherical harmonic , @xmath44 is a polar angle , @xmath45 is an azimuthal angle . in , @xmath46 represents the the radial component of the wavefunction and it is defined using the following equation @xmath47 using the electronic density of an atom @xmath36 in our model can be given as @xmath48 by exploiting the properties of the spherical harmonics and by summing over @xmath41 , the above equation is reduced to @xmath49 which is angular independent . finally we can calculate the value of @xmath5 by incorporating @xmath36 , given by equations  ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ tau0 ] ) .",
    "after determining the values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we can explicitly write the functional for calculating the kinetic energy for an atom using the correction based on the proposed model . the new functional",
    "is given by the following equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is found by considering the exactly solvable model with the same nuclear charge @xmath7 , @xmath52    when using the proposed functional for the kinetic energy of an atom , we would calculate the @xmath3 based on some electron density approximation and the correction using the value of @xmath7 . in practical application , it is necessary to consider the case when the last shell is partially filled . in such cases , it is not possible to directly apply with an integer @xmath26 .",
    "since the closed shells occur only for a few values of the nuclear charge given by the sequence of `` magic numbers '' @xmath53 , we need to define the interpolation of the function @xmath54 to other integer values of @xmath7 .",
    "here , we use an interpolation by a cubic polynomial based on four points @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 : @xmath59",
    "for many applications , it is more convenient to represent the energy of the system based on the total nuclear charge @xmath7 .",
    "this form can be acquired by solving in respect to @xmath26 and substitution of the result into , we obtain the energy as a function of the nuclear charge , @xmath60 a more suitable format for is in the form of an expansion in powers of @xmath61 .",
    "the transformed equation has the following form @xmath62 where the terms proportional to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are identically zero . in numerics , is simply @xmath67    with the goal of being able to assess the validity of the model for calculating the kinetic energy , we compare it to the corresponding expansion of thomas - fermi approximation , where the energy of an atom with large nuclear charge @xmath7 can be written as an asymptotic series in powers of a small parameter @xmath61 .",
    "this expansion is found to be @xcite , @xmath68 the largest absolute difference between equations  ( [ ekinz ] ) and ( [ ekinzat ] ) is the leading term .",
    "this is mainly due to the inclusion of coulomb repulsion between electrons which decreases the thomas ",
    "fermi  energy by a factor of @xmath69 because of the increase of the size of the atom .",
    "the second subdominant term @xmath70 remains the same .",
    "this term comprises the correction of strongly bound electrons @xcite which is not affected by the inter - electron repulsion .    to assess the accuracy of the thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation , we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the thomas ",
    "fermi  energy in the limit of large number of electrons @xmath71 . to estimate the large-@xmath0 behavior , we have calculated @xmath9 for increasing values of @xmath26 and found , using richardson s extrapolation @xcite , that for large @xmath26 @xmath72 we characterize the accuracy of the approximation by measuring the deviation of the expansion ( [ tfnexp ] ) from the exact coefficients in @xcite .",
    "we find that the thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation correctly reproduces the leading term @xmath73 , but makes a @xmath74 error in the subdominant term @xmath75 .",
    "thus we can say according to the definition from@xcite that the thomas ",
    "fermi  approximation is large-@xmath0 asymptotically exact to the first degree ( ae1 ) .",
    "in this section , the presented functional and the corresponding approach are implemented for verification .",
    "first we compare the electron density of the proposed model and its large-@xmath7 limit .",
    "then , we compare the model to the known gradient expansion corrections of thomas ",
    "fermi  kedf . finally , we perform computational experiments to show that the proposed functional gives a significant improvement to the standard thomas - fermi approximation when applied to atoms . an improvement by about an order of magnitude is achieved .      in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the behavior of electron density of the proposed model to the one acquired using the thomas - fermi formalism vs. @xmath7 .",
    "we start with some remarks regarding the density of the model . in section",
    "[ correction ] , the electron density is derived from the wavefunction as a sum of @xmath76 terms given by . for large @xmath7 , the number of terms grows to infinity .",

    "the analysis of trends of the gradient expansion  for atoms remains somehow inconclusive , because of very slow asymptotical behavior ( typically as @xmath99 ) and because of shell effects ( oscillations of density ) .",

    "fermi  theory would work significantly better for cases with uncompensated spins , like atoms of b , c , n , o , f.    overall , the same table shows that the proposed method is competitive , with functionals based on the second and forth order gradient expansions when precision is considered .",
