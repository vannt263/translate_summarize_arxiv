    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems are in some respects ( e.g. luminosity function ) , more similar to one another than are their host galaxies .",
    "this suggests an underlying uniformity in the physical conditions under which gc systems and galaxies formed . on the other hand , properties such as the total number of clusters per unit galaxy luminosity show significant variations , and fundamental questions concerning the origins of these variations remain unanswered .",
    "in particular , the roles of tidal encounters , mergers , cooling flows , and initial conditions in the formation of gc systems have yet to be understood .",
    "two galaxies of particular interest in this regard are ngc 1399 at the center of the fornax cluster and a nearby cluster member ngc 1404 . by studying the gc systems of these two galaxies we hope to better understand the environmental influences on the formation of gcs and their host galaxies .",
    "various estimates of the distance modulus to the fornax cluster have been made in recent years .",
    "here we adopt a typical value of m ",
    "m = 31.2 , which places the cluster 0.2 mag more distant than virgo ( jacoby 1992 ) . with this distance modulus and no galactic extinction correction ,",
    "the optical luminosity of ngc 1399 is m@xmath2 = 21.74 ( faber 1989 ) .",
    "this cd galaxy is surrounded by hot x  ray emitting gas which extends out to at least 38@xmath3 or 190 kpc ( mason & rosen 1985 ; ikebe 1996 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio increases with galactocentric distance reaching a value of m / l @xmath4 70 m@xmath5/l@xmath5 at @xmath4 5@xmath3 ( grillmair 1994a ) .",
    "well within the x  ray envelope , even allowing for projection effects , at about 10@xmath3 ( 50 kpc ) to the south  east of ngc 1399 lies ngc 1404 .",
    "it is classified as an e1 galaxy and has an optical luminosity of m@xmath2 = 21.37 ( faber 1989 ) .",
    "the gc systems of ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 have been studied using ground  based imaging by a number of workers ( ngc 1399 : hanes & harris 1986 ; giesler & forte 1990 ; wagner 1991 ; bridges 1991 ; ostrov 1993 ; kissler ",
    "patig 1997a and ngc 1404 : hanes & harris 1986 ; richtler 1992 ) . for ngc 1399 ,",
    "kissler  patig ( 1997a ) gives the total number of gcs to be n@xmath6 = 5940 @xmath0 570 .",
    "this gives a high specific frequency s@xmath1 = 11 @xmath0 4 .",
    "a kinematic study of the gcs around ngc 1399 showed that the outer gcs appear to be dynamically related more to the cluster of galaxies than they are to ngc 1399 itself ( grillmair 1994a ) .",
    "this suggests that accretion of intracluster gcs ( west 1995 ) , tidal stripping ( forte 1982 ; forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) or mergers ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) may help to explain the high specific frequency of ngc 1399 . for ngc 1404",
    "the number of gcs is less certain .",
    "hanes & harris ( 1986 ) from a photographic study estimated n@xmath6 = 190 @xmath0 80 , while more recently richtler ( 1992 ) found n@xmath6 = 880 @xmath0 120 .",
    "the resulting s@xmath1 values range from 0.5 @xmath0 0.3 to 2.5 @xmath0 0.3 respectively .",
    "the latter value is close to the average for ellipticals in the fornax cluster .",
    "here we present imaging data from _",
    "hst s _ wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the cerro tololo inter  american observatory s ( ctio ) 1.5 m telescope of ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 .",
    "the wfpc2 data provide accurate magnitudes and colours with virtually no contamination from foreground stars or background galaxies .",
    "these data are complemented by wide field - of - view ccd imaging from ctio . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the colour ( metallicity ) and spatial distribution of gcs .",
    "the gc luminosity functions in these two galaxies and others in the fornax cluster are addressed by grillmair ( 1997 ) , and a detailed study of ngc 1379 , using wfpc2 and ctio data , is given by elson ( 1997 ) .",
    "details of our hst imaging program are given by grillmair ( 1997 ) .",
    "here we use four pointings from that programme , namely a central pointing on each of ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 , an outer pointing for ngc 1399 and a background field . the outer pointing ( f0338 )",
    "is situated in the cd envelope of ngc 1399 , on the opposite side of the galaxy from ngc 1404 .",
    "the background field ( f0336 ) is situated approximately 1.4 degrees south of ngc 1399 in a blank region of sky and serves to measure the surface density of background sources .",
    "exposure times totaled 1800s in f814w and 5200s in f450w for ngc 1399 ; 1860s and 5000s for ngc 1404 using the wfpc2 camera .",
    "three images were taken at one pointing , the other two were offset by 0.5@xmath7 which corresponds roughly to integer pixel shifts in both the pc and wfc chips .",
    "the images were then aligned and median  combined using vista software which effectively removed both cosmic rays and hot pixels .",
    "the resulting images were found to be statistically superior to those reduced using standard stsdas tasks , and enabled us to push our completeness limit to about @xmath8 without incurring large numbers of spurious detections .",
    "compact sources in each pointing have been detected and measured using daophot ii / allstar software as described in grillmair ( 1997 ) .",
    "for the pc chips the galaxy was subtracted off first .",
    "magnitudes have been converted into standard johnson  cousins b and i. no galactic extinction correction has been applied .",
    "a colour  magnitude diagram for all of the detected sources in each of the four pointings is shown in fig .",
    "completeness tests indicate that the 50% incompleteness occurs at b @xmath4 26.5 for all four pointings , with small variations between each pointing .",
    "( note for the pc chips it is about 0.5 mag brighter . ) in order to avoid any colour bias in our results we have excluded all sources fainter than this limit .",
    "we have also excluded sources brighter than b = 21 as these objects would be more luminous than galactic gcs , and so are probably foreground stars .",
    "we also applied a colour cut to the data , so that only sources with 1.2 @xmath9 b ",
    "i @xmath9 2.5 are included .",
    "this cut is roughly equivalent to 2.5 @xmath9 [ fe / h ] @xmath9 + 1.0 , assuming the galactic colour  metallicity relation of couture ( 1990 ) , and covers the range of expected gc metallicities . for ngc 1399 , 95% of all sources lie within this colour selection and for ngc 1404 it is 90% .",
    "this magnitude and colour selection are indicated in fig . 1 by dashed lines .",
    "with these selection cuts applied our final sample consists of 572 objects in ngc 1399 central , 59 in ngc 1399 outer and 208 in ngc 1404 .",
    "the background field has only 14 objects .",
    "this background field allows us to fairly accurately estimate the proportion of _ bona fide _ gcs in the three galaxy pointings , i.e. @xmath10 98% in ngc 1399 central , @xmath10 76% in ngc 1399 off  center and @xmath10 93% in ngc 1404 .",
    "broad  band b and i images of ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 were taken with the ctio 1.5 m telescope .",
    "we used a tek 2048 x 2048 array with a pixel scale of 0.44@xmath7/pixel , yielding a field - of - view 15@xmath3 on a side .",
    "the galaxies were observed in 1995 december with typical seeing conditions of @xmath4 1.5@xmath7 .",
    "data reduction was carried out in the standard way ( i.e. bias and dark subtraction , flat  fielding and sky subtraction ) .",
    "the total exposure times were 9600s in b and 3660s in i for ngc 1399 ; 9100s in b and 3060s in i for ngc 1404 . after combining ,",
    "the images were calibrated using aperture photometry from the catalogs of longo & de vaucouleurs ( 1983 ) and de vaucouleurs & longo ( 1988 ) .",
    "this procedure gave an rms accuracy of @xmath0 0.08 mag for ngc 1399 and @xmath0 0.05 mag for ngc 1404 .",
    "no galactic extinction correction was applied .",
    "globular clusters were detected automatically using daophot .",
    "the detection threshold was set at a conservative 5@xmath11 per pixel i.e. , five times the background noise .",
    "selection cuts in the daophot ` sharpness ' and ` roundness ' parameters were made to help remove cosmic rays and extended objects from the candidate lists .",
    "( these parameters help to remove spikey objects and very non  round objects . ) for each detected object we measured a 3 pixel radius aperture magnitude and applied an aperture correction based on a curve - of - growth type analysis for a dozen isolated gcs .",
    "the rms from the aperture correction is @xmath4 0.05 mag .",
    "magnitude diagrams for all of the detected sources for the two galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "2 . for the ctio data we decided to adopt the same colour selection criteria as the hst data , and the same bright magnitude cutoff . for the faint magnitude cutoff , we use the 50% incompleteness value . based on an examination of the luminosity function , we estimate that for ngc 1399 the 50% value is b @xmath4 24.3 and for ngc 1404 it is b @xmath4 24.2 .",
    "thus our ctio selection criteria are 1.2 @xmath9 b ",
    "i @xmath9 2.5 and 21 @xmath9 b @xmath9 24.2/24.3 , as is indicated in fig . 2 by dashed lines .",
    "even with our selection criteria we expect some contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies in our samples of 1752 objects in ngc 1399 and 858 objects in ngc 1404 .",
    "this issue will be discussed below .",
    "we note that although the ctio data only sample the brighter gcs , we do not expect this to bias the metallicity distribution .",
    "for gcs in the milky way and m31 ( huchra , brodie & kent 1991 ) and in ngc 5846 ( forbes , brodie & huchra 1996 ) there appears to be no luminosity  metallicity dependence .",
    "given the magnitude depth and the availability of a background field , our hst data are ideal to examine the surface density distribution of gcs .",
    "we first calculate the gc density in 5 annuli around ngc 1399 .",
    "we make use of the fact that out to 100@xmath7 radius the wfpc2 gives almost complete 180@xmath12 coverage for one hemisphere of the galaxy ( see forbes , franx & illingworth 1995 for details ) . for the ngc 1399 outer and background fields we simply add up the total number of gcs , i.e. 59 and 14 respectively . we have also made a small correction ( @xmath4 15% ) for the expected number of undetected gcs at the faint end of the luminosity function as determined by grillmair ( 1997 ) .",
    "next , we divide the number of gcs by the appropriate spatial coverage to give a surface density .",
    "finally , we subtract off the background density of 2.9 objects per square arcmin giving the background  corrected surface density of gcs .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    excluding the innermost 2 data points for ngc 1399 we have fit the data with a function of the form :    @xmath13    this fit is shown by a solid line for which @xmath14 = 126 arcmin@xmath15 and @xmath16 = 1.2 @xmath0 0.2 .",
    "it is clear from the ngc 1399 outer pointing that there are gcs at a projected radius of 8.2 arcmin from ngc 1399 . extrapolating the profile to 9.7 arcmin (",
    "the projected distance of ngc 1404 ) suggests that there is about one gc per square arcmin associated with ngc 1399 .",
    "this corresponds to half a dozen gcs in the wfpc2 field - of - view centered on ngc 1404 .",
    "the procedure for estimating the surface density profile of ngc 1404 is similar to that of ngc 1399 , except that we subtract both the background density and the expected density of gcs in each annulus due to ngc 1399 . again",
    "the hst data is fit using a powerlaw profile ( excluding the innermost data point ) with @xmath14 = 36 arcmin@xmath15 and @xmath16 = 1.3 @xmath0 0.2 .    for both galaxies the gc surface density rises towards the galaxy center but flattens off ( in log space ) in the very inner regions giving a definable ` core ' to the gc system where the profile changes slope .",
    "this does not appear to be a selection effect and has been observed in other large galaxies ( e.g. grillmair 1986 , 1994b ) .",
    "forbes ( 1996 ) found that the ` core radius ' of the gc system is loosely correlated with the galaxy luminosity .",
    "we estimate that the gc systems of ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 have core radii of 40@xmath7 ( 3.4 kpc ) and 30@xmath7 ( 2.5 kpc ) respectively .",
    "these values are within the scatter of the relation found by forbes ( 1996 ) and are similar to the galaxy effective radii .",
    "we have measured a gc surface density slope of 1.2 @xmath0 0.2 for ngc 1399 .",
    "there have been three previous ccd studies which measured the gc slope .",
    "wagner ( 1991 ) found that interior to @xmath4 120@xmath7 the gc slope was 1.4 @xmath0 0.11 , and this steepened to 1.54 @xmath0 0.15 for larger radii .",
    "kissler  patig ( 1997a ) derived 1.55 @xmath0 0.25 and 1.75 @xmath0 0.3 from two pointings for radii beyond @xmath4 50@xmath7 .",
    "bridges ( 1991 ) measured 1.4 @xmath0 0.2 from their b band data and 1.5 @xmath0 0.2 from their v band data .",
    "our value is somewhat flatter than those measured by others .",
    "one possible reason for this is that our outer pointing is located in the cd envelope of ngc 1399 where the gc surface density ` flattens out ' ( e.g kissler ",
    "patig 1997a ) . if we exclude the outer point , our fitted slope steepens to 1.25 .",
    "another possibility is that , even though we have not included the inner two data points in the fit , we are still fitting into the core  flattened region .",
    "the stellar profile ( log intensity ) for ngc 1399 is also shown in fig .",
    "we measure a slope of 1.6 @xmath0 0.1 for the galaxy light .",
    "this compares with the measurements of 1.67 @xmath0 0.12 ( wagner 1991 ) and 1.75 @xmath0 0.1 ( kissler  patig 1997a ) .",
    "there are been some debate as to whether the gc profile is flatter than the galaxy profile in ngc 1399 . in particular , bridges ( 1991 )",
    "claimed that the gc system had the same slope as the galaxy . whereas both wagner ( 1991 ) and kissler  patig ( 1997a ) said it was somewhat flatter . excluding our data , the weighted mean value from previous studies is 1.47 @xmath0 0.09 for the gc slope and 1.72 @xmath0 0.06 for the galaxy slope .",
    "this indicates that the gc profile is 0.25 @xmath0 0.11 flatter than the galaxy starlight .",
    "our data suggest that the difference is even greater , i.e. 0.4 @xmath0 0.22 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the gc surface density profile is flatter than the galaxy starlight by about 0.3 in the log at about the 2 @xmath11 significance level . for ngc 1404",
    ", we measure a gc slope of 1.3 @xmath0 0.2 and a galaxy starlight slope of 1.9 @xmath0 0.1 .",
    "thus the gc systems in both galaxies have a flatter , more extended distribution that the underlying starlight .    using the surface density profile we can estimate the total number of gcs and the specific frequency ( s@xmath1",
    "; harris & van den bergh 1981 ) for ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 . for ngc",
    "1399 gcs are clearly extended beyond 8 arcmin in our data .",
    "we have decided to use 10 arcmin as the limiting radius , which is the same limit used by hanes & harris ( 1986 ) in their photographic study . integrating the powerlaw profile between log r = 0.2 ( 38@xmath7 ) and 1 ( 10 arcmin ) , and adding the number of gcs interior to 38@xmath7",
    "gives a total of 5700 gcs .",
    "the uncertainty in deriving the total number of gcs is dominated by the choice of limiting radius .",
    "we have used @xmath01 arcminute about the limiting radius as our error estimate . thus limiting radii of 9 and 11",
    "arcminutes give n = 5700 @xmath0 500 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the determination of kissler  patig ( 1997a ) of n = 5940 @xmath0 570 . for an absolute magnitude of m@xmath2 = 21.74 , the specific frequency s@xmath1 = 11.5 @xmath0 1.0 .    for ngc 1404",
    "the limiting radius is difficult to estimate .",
    "richtler ( 1992 ) determined a background level at @xmath4 200@xmath7 .",
    "we find that in the direction of ngc 1399 , the density of gcs is clearly dominated by ngc 1399 beyond about 250@xmath7 .",
    "we have chosen to integrate out to 240@xmath7 ( 4 arcmin ) with a reasonable range of 35 arcminutes . thus integrating the profile from log r = 0.3 ( 30@xmath7 ) to 0.6 ( 4 arcmin ) and adding the number of inner gcs gives n = 725 @xmath0 145 gcs associated with ngc 1404 .",
    "this lies between the hanes & harris ( 1986 ) value ( 190 @xmath0 80 ) and that of richtler ( 1992 ) , i.e. 880 @xmath0 120 .",
    "compared to these ground  based studies , our hst data has the advantages of accurate background subtraction ( star , galaxies and ngc 1399 gcs ) and nearly 100% complete magnitude coverage .",
    "for an absolute magnitude of m@xmath2 = 21.37 , our results indicate a relatively low specific frequency for ngc 1404 of s@xmath1 = 2.0 @xmath0 0.5 . again using the hst data",
    ", we calculate the ` local ' s@xmath1 values ( i.e. using the number of gcs and the integrated magnitude at the de vaucouleurs effective radius ) to be @xmath4 1.5 for ngc 1399 and @xmath4 0.5 for ngc 1404 .    in figures 4 and 5",
    "we show the azimuthal distribution of gcs , as determined from the hst data , over the range for which we have uniform radial and azimuthal coverage . for ngc 1399 ( fig .",
    "4 ) slight enhancements in the gc counts can be seen close to the galaxy major axes ( position angles @xmath4 100@xmath12 and 80@xmath12 ) .",
    "there is also a slight deficit around the minor axis p.a . @xmath4 10@xmath12 .",
    "thus the gc system is broadly aligned with the stellar isophotes .",
    "the direction towards ngc 1404 ( p.a . @xmath4",
    "150@xmath12 ) is not covered by our hst image . for ngc 1404 , shown in fig .",
    "5 , there is slight deficit in gc counts along the galaxy major axis lies at p.a . @xmath4",
    "there are also two enhancements at position angles @xmath4 50@xmath12 and 10@xmath12 which do not correspond to either galaxy major or minor axes .      the gc colour distributions , after colour and magnitude selection , for the four hst pointings are shown in fig .",
    "both ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 are dominated by red ( b  i @xmath4 2.1 ) gcs but with a significant tail to the blue ( e.g. b ",

    "the ctio data , after colour and magnitude selection , are shown in fig .",
    "we do not have a background field for the ctio data .",
    "although we have attempted to remove galaxies using the daophot sharpness and roundness parameters , our seeing conditions of @xmath4 1.5@xmath7 imply that some galaxies will be included in our candidate list .",
    "the issue of background galaxy contamination in gc colour / metallicity distributions is discussed in some detail by elson ( 1997 ) .",

    "the galaxy counts are falling fast at our blue cutoff of b ",
    "i = 1.2 . given the richness of the ngc 1399 gc system , background galaxies are likely to be a small affect .",
    "however it may be more of a concern for ngc 1404 .",
    "we can estimate the effects of background contamination using the cfrs sample ( lilly 1995 ) within the appropriate b magnitude range and scaled in area to match that of the ctio data .",
    "the background ",
    "corrected distributions are shown by a dashed line in fig .",
    "as we have already removed some galaxies in our initial detection process , the true distribution may lie somewhere between the two histograms . in either case ( uncorrected or corrected )",
    "the distributions reveal a somewhat different situation to the hst data , with both galaxy s gc systems peaking in the blue ( b  i @xmath4 1.6 ) with a significant red tail ( around b ",

    "i = 1.84 for ngc 1399 and 1.71 for ngc 1404 .",
    "thus the ctio colours are on average systematically @xmath4 0.1 mag bluer than the hst data .",
    "this result is not formally significant as the error is also on the order of 0.1 mag , but differences between the shape of the two distributions are clearly seen . as the hst data cover only the central regions of each galaxy",
    ", this suggests a radial colour gradient from red dominated objects at small galactocentric radii to blue ones further out . in principle",
    ", such a gradient could be caused by blue background galaxies in the ctio data .",
    "however we give further evidence below that this is not the case .    in fig .",
    "8 we show the gc colour distributions for ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 from the hst data . here",
    "the data for ngc 1399 includes both the central and outer pointing .",
    "the background  corrected histograms are shown by dashed lines .",
    "some galaxies , such as m87 ( whitmore 1995 ; elson & santiago 1996 ) reveal a clear bimodal gc colour distribution . in other cases ( i.e. ngc 1374 , 1379 , 1387 , 1427 ) the distribution is essentially consistent with a single unimodal colour for the gc system ( kissler  patig 1997a , b ) .",
    "the situation for ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 is not as clear .",
    "nevertheless there is some evidence for multiple gc populations .",
    "firstly , both galaxies have distributions that are significantly broader than that expected from the photometric errors ( typically @xmath11 @xmath4 0.15 ) , i.e. there is a real spread in gc colours .",
    "secondly , we have tested the unbinned colour data using the kmm statistical test ( ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) .",
    "this test rejects a single gaussian fit to the ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 data with a confidence of over 99% .",

    "i = 1.7 and 2.1 for ngc 1399 , and b ",
    "i = 1.6 and 2.1 for ngc 1404 .",
    "thirdly , as an exercise , we generated a colour histogram that is the sum of two gaussians .",
    "these gaussians have mean colours of b ",
    "i = 1.6 and 2.1 with dispersions similar to the photometric error , and with total numbers in the ratio of 1:4 .",

    "fourth , the two peaks indicated in the hst data are also present in the ctio data ( fig .",

    "as indicated by the kmm test , a bimodal distribution is a better representation of the data than a single gaussian .",
    "the two gc populations have means of [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.5 and 0.1 .",
    "we now return to the ctio data and the issue of background contamination .",
    "earlier we argued that contamination , although present , did not change the basic appearance of the colour distributions .",
    "further evidence that the two peaks in the ctio data are dominated by _",
    "bona fide _ gcs comes from examining the spatial distribution of the two subpopulations .",
    "first , we define the metal  rich and metal  poor gc subpopulations in each galaxy as being @xmath0 0.3 dex about the mean metallicity of each subpopulation .",
    "we then calculate the raw surface density ( i.e. not corrected for background contamination or for the missing faint end of the luminosity function ) for the two subpopulations .",
    "these surface density profiles are shown in fig .",
    "a background correction would tend to lower the metal  poor profile , particularly at galactocentric radii beyond 4 arcmin in ngc 1404 ( which is excluded from the figure ) . although there is considerable scatter , the surface density of each subpopulation declines with distance from its parent galaxy .",
    "this indicates that each subpopulation is associated with the galaxy and is therefore dominated by gcs .",
    "secondly , the fact that the hst colours ( metallicities ) agree with those in the inner annuli of the ctio data ( see figures 12 and 13 ) indicates that the subpopulations are dominated by gcs .",
    "next we investigate the radial variation of gc metallicity .",
    "we have seen that for both ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 , the metal  rich ( red ) subpopulation dominates in the hst data and in the ctio data the metal  poor ( blue ) subpopulation is dominant .",
    "as the hst data probe the inner @xmath4 100@xmath7 region and the ctio data cover the regions beyond @xmath4 30@xmath7 this would suggest that the metal  rich gcs are more centrally concentrated than the metal  poor ones .",
    "a similar situation is inferred for ngc 4472 ( geisler 1996 ) and ngc 5846 ( forbes , brodie & huchra 1997 ) . an unweighted fit to the hst data indeed indicates a metallicity gradient in both galaxies .",
    "for ngc 1399 we find [ fe / h ] = 0.31@xmath00.13 log r ( arcsec )  0.046@xmath00.22 .",
    "this slope is similar to that found by ostrov ( 1993 ) i.e. 0.34@xmath00.18 .",
    "the fit for ngc 1404 gives [ fe / h ] = 0.36@xmath00.13 log r ( arcsec )  0.034@xmath00.22 . in both cases",
    "the hst fits are consistent with the ctio data . in ngc 4472 ,",
    "geisler ( 1996 ) found that the radial gc metallicity gradient was actually due to the changing relative mix of the two gc subpopulations . assuming that ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 can be represented by metal  rich and metal  poor gc subpopulations we investigate the radial gradients further .    in figures 12 and 13",
    "we show the metallicity in various radial bins for the different gc subpopulations and the mean metallicity for the combined population .",
    "the range in metallicity included in each data point is @xmath0 0.3 dex . for ngc 1399 ( fig .",
    "12 ) the metal  poor and metal  rich gc subpopulations show no obvious radial metallicity gradient .",
    "however the mean values for the whole gc system _ do _ show a global radial gradient .",
    "although not quite as convincing , the same trend appears to be true for ngc 1404 ( fig . 13 ) . for both galaxies ,",
    "we conclude that the radial metallicity gradient for the overall gc system is consistent with the changing relative proportions of the gc subpopulations ; the metal  rich gcs are centrally concentrated while the metal  poor ones are preferentially located in the outer regions .",
    "the lack of a real abundance gradient places constraints on the role of gas dissipation in the formation of gcs . in ngc 4472",
    ", the metallicity of the galaxy field stars was found to be of the same or of slightly higher metallicity than the metal  rich gcs ( geisler 1996 ) . for ngc 1399 , brodie & huchra ( 1991 ) quote a spectroscopic metallicity of [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 @xmath0 0.9 .",
    "this is similar to the metallicity derived from b ",
    "i colours of the galaxy ( from our ctio data and from goudfrooij 1994 ) . for ngc 1404 , the galaxy b ",
    "i colours indicate [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.2 .",
    "thus for both galaxies , the field stars appear to have similar metallicities to those of metal  rich gcs ( which have [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.1 ) .",
    "the merger model of ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) and zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) make some specific predictions concerning the properties of gcs in ellipticals that are the result of a gaseous merger .",
    "one of their key predictions is that ellipticals will have multimodal gc metallicity distributions .",
    "furthermore the metal  rich gcs will be centrally concentrated and the more metal  poor ones will be preferentially located at large galactocentric radii . this indeed appears to be the case for both ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 , and is therefore in qualitative agreement with their model . for ngc 1404 with a low s@xmath1 value ( i.e. 2.0 @xmath0 0.5 ) , ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) expect slightly fewer metal  rich ( new ) than metal  poor ( old ) gcs .",
    "our data are generally consistent with this expectation . for ngc 1399 with s@xmath1 = 11.5 @xmath0 1.0",
    ", they would expect n@xmath17/n@xmath18 @xmath4 34 . in the central regions of ngc 1399",
    "such a ratio may hold , but globally n@xmath17/n@xmath18 @xmath9 1 .",
    "this is of course complicated by the difficulty in defining clear metal  rich and metal  poor gc subpopulations .",
    "however there seems to be a shortfall in the number of newly created gcs if gaseous mergers are responsible for the metal  rich gcs and the high s@xmath1 value .",
    "another expectation from their merger model is that the galaxy starlight and gc system should have a similar spatial distribution in galaxies with high s@xmath1 values ( i.e. those galaxies in which large numbers of new gcs should have been created by the merger ) .",
    "thus we might expect the surface density of gcs to match that of the galaxy surface brightness profile for ngc 1399 but not for ngc 1404 .",
    "our data indicate that for both galaxies the gc distribution is notably flatter than the underlying starlight .",
    "we might also expect the metal  rich gcs , which should have formed from the gas of the progenitor galaxies , to reveal a radial metallicity gradient as the formation process should be dissipative .",
    "figures 12 and 13 suggest that there is little or no metallicity gradient for the metal  rich gcs in either galaxy .    to summarize , the gc systems in ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 reveal some properties that are consistent with the ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) merger model , but there are also notable conflicts .",
    "on an individual basis , some of the disagreements with the model may be accommodated by slight modifications to the initial model ( see zepf , ashman & geisler 1995 ) .",
    "forbes , brodie & grillmair ( 1997 ) have recently investigated whether a sample of elliptical galaxies meets the general predictions of the ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) model , and concluded that mergers were _ unlikely _ to account for the gc systems in large elliptical galaxies .",
    "they favored a multiphase collapse scenario .",
    "next we compare the data for ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 with this scenario .",
    "forbes , brodie & grillmair ( 1997 ) have proposed that gcs in ellipticals form _ in situ _ during a multiphase collapse . in the first pre  galactic phase , metal  poor gcs are formed and later on , in the second galactic phase , the metal  rich gcs form .",
    "this leads to a bimodal metallicity distribution with the metal  rich gcs more centrally concentrated than the metal  poor ones . in massive ellipticals",
    "the collapse could be largely dissipationless and so no strong radial abundance gradients are expected .",
    "the radial distribution of ( the metal ",
    "poor ) gcs will be more extended than the galaxy itself , if as expected , they form before the galactic stars .",
    "the overall metallicity and spatial properties of gcs derived from our data are consistent with this picture .    for cd galaxies , such as ngc 1399 ,",
    "forbes , brodie & grillmair ( 1997 ) suggested an additional source of gcs from tidal stripping of nearby galaxies .",
    "they suggested that some of gc subpopulation identified by ostrov ( 1993 ) at around [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.8 were acquired from ngc 1404 and possibly other fornax galaxies .",
    "recently , jone ( 1997 ) have interpreted the asymmetric x  ray emission around ngc 1404 as evidence for tidal interaction with ngc 1399 .",
    "the idea of tidal stripping of gcs is given some support by our new data .",
    "the outer regions of ngc 1404 are dominated by metal ",
    "poor gcs , and it is these gcs that may be preferentially stripped and captured by ngc 1399 . thus some of the gcs in ngc 1399 with this intermediate metallicity may have originated from ngc 1404 .",
    "we confirmed that ngc 1404 has a remarkably low specific frequency value ( s@xmath1 = 2.0 @xmath0 0.5 ) for a cluster elliptical , suggesting that some gcs may have been lost .",
    "if ngc 1404 originally had s@xmath1 = 5 , i.e. typical of normal ellipticals outside of the fornax cluster then it has lost @xmath4 1000 gcs , which may have been tidally captured by ngc 1399 .",
    "if we assume that the gc system and galaxy starlight originally ( i.e. before tidal stripping ) continued beyond 4 arcminutes with the same slope as found in section 3.1 , then we can calculate the s@xmath1 value of the stripped gcs .",
    "we find that the stripped gcs are unlikely reach values of s@xmath1 @xmath4 11.5 in sufficient numbers to have any appreciable effect on the specific frequency of ngc 1399 .",
    "we expected the gc surface density profile to match that of the underlying starlight in the inner regions of ngc 1404 , but it appears to be somewhat flatter than the stellar profile ( at least for galactocentric radii of less than @xmath4 150@xmath7 ) .",
    "this may just be indicating that tidal stripping has not yet affected the galaxy inner regions .",
    "the above circumstantial evidence suggests that ngc 1399 has acquired gcs from ngc 1404 , although this is unlikely to explain the high specific frequency of ngc 1399 .",
    "large samples of gc metallicity and kinematic information from spectra are probably required before the multiphase collapse and tidal stripping ideas can be fully tested .",
    "we present new optical data of the globular cluster ( gc ) systems in ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 .",
    "our images were taken in b and i filters using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the 1.5 m telescope at cerro tololo inter  american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "this provides us with high spatial resolution in the central regions and wide area coverage respectively . from the hst data we have detected over 500 gcs in ngc 1399 and over 200 in ngc 1404 , covering @xmath4 90% of the gc luminosity function . with the aid of an hst background field of the same exposure time",
    ", we estimate that the contamination levels in the hst samples are only a few percent .",
    "both galaxies reveal a broad gc colour / metallicity distribution .",
    "these distributions are _ inconsistent _ with a single gaussian . for ngc 1399 , two gaussians with mean metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.1 and 0.1 provide a reasonable representation of the data , although a multimodal distribution with several different gc subpopulations remains a possibility . in the case of ngc 1404",
    "we tentatively claim evidence for a bimodal gc distribution with the metal  poor population around [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.5 and the metal",
    " rich population at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.1 . in both galaxies",
    "the different metallicity peaks are consistent with distinct gc subpopulations in which the metal  rich gcs are more centrally concentrated than the metal  poor ones .",
    "globally , the gc systems reveal metallicity gradients",
    ". however these gradients are consistent with a changing relative mix of the two gc subpopulations with galactocentric radius .",
    "we derive gc surface density profiles , and show them to be flatter ( i.e. more extended ) than the underlying starlight .",
    "the total number of gcs and specific frequency are calculated to be n = 5700 @xmath0 500 , s@xmath1 = 11.5 @xmath0 1.0 for ngc 1399 and n = 725 @xmath0 145 , s@xmath1 = 2.0 @xmath0 0.5 for ngc 1404 .",
    "finally we discuss our results in the context of two gc formation scenarios .",
    "the gc data on ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 are generally more consistent with a multiphase collapse ( e.g. forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) than a merger ( e.g. ashman & zepf 1992 ) origin .",
