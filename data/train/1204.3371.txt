    "the recent progress in the experimental activity in atomic physics , quantum optics and nanoscience has provided a great opportunity to investigate the interplay between quantum and statistical behaviors in particle systems .",

    "experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices have provided a great opportunity to investigate the unitary quantum evolution of closed many - body systems , exploiting their low dissipation rate which maintains phase coherence for a long time  @xcite . in this experimental context , the theoretical investigation of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum many - body systems , and the time evolution of the entanglement properties characterizing the quantum correlations , is of great importance for a deep understanding of the fundamental issues of quantum dynamics , their possible applications , and new developments .",
    "we consider the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of particle systems which are initially trapped within a limited region of space by an external force , and then released from the trap .",
    "interesting cases are fermi gases , or bose gases with repulsive interactions , which are initially confined within hard - wall or harmonic traps . the free expansion of gases after the drop of the trap is routinely exploited in experiments to infer the properties of the initial quantum state of the particles within the trap  @xcite , observing the interference patterns of absorption images in the large - time ballistic regime .",
    "the time - dependence of the particle density and correlations have been investigated in the literature , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in this paper",

    "the quantum correlations arising during the nonequilibrium many - body dynamics can be characterized by the expectation values of product of local one - particle operators , such as the particle density , the one - particle and density correlations , etc ... , or by their integral over a space region @xmath5 , such as the cumulants of the particle - number distribution within @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations are also characterized by the fundamental phenomenon of entanglement , which gives rise to nontrivial connections between different parts of extended quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "a measure of entanglement is achieved by computing von neumann ( vn ) or rnyi entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem .",
    "one - particle correlations and bipartite entanglement entropies provide important and complementary information of the quantum behavior of many - body systems , of their ground states ( in particular in connection with critical behavior ) and of their nonequilibrium unitary evolutions under time variations of the hamiltonian , because they probe different features of the quantum dynamics .",
    "in this paper we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) noninteracting fermi gas of @xmath0 particles whose initially zero - temperature state is the ground state within hard walls or in the presence of an external harmonic potential .",
    "this model has a wider application , because 1d bose gases in the limit of strong short - ranged repulsive interactions can be mapped into a spinless fermion gas , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "indeed , 1d bose gases with repulsive two - particle short - ranged interactions , described by the lieb - liniger model  @xcite , become more and more nonideal with decreasing the particle density , acquiring fermion - like properties , so that the 1d gas of impenetrable bosons , or tonks - girardeau gas  @xcite , provides an effective description of the low - density regime of 1d bosonic gases  @xcite . due to their exact mapping ,",
    "1d gases of impenetrable bosons and spinless fermions share the same quantum correlations related to the particle density , particle fluctuations of extended regions , and bipartite entanglement entropies of connected parts , even during nonequilibrium dynamics .",

    "we show that some regimes of the time evolution are characterized by asymptotic behaviors analogous to the equilibrium ( ground - state ) ones , whose leading logarithms are essentially determined by the corresponding conformal field theory with central charge @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we investigate the relations between entanglement entropies and the distribution of the particle number within the same extended region . in the ground state of noninteracting fermi gases",
    "the entanglement entropies are asymptotically proportional to the particle variance for a large number of particles  @xcite .",
    "thus the particle variance may be considered as an effective probe of entanglement in these class of systems , which should be more easily accessible to experiments .",

    "1d bose gases with repulsive two - particle short - ranged interactions become more and more nonideal with decreasing the particle density , acquiring fermion - like properties , so that the 1d gas of impenetrable bosons is expected to provide an effective description of the low - density regime of confined 1d bosonic gases  @xcite . therefore , due to the mapping between 1d gases of impenetrable bosons and spinless fermions , some correlations in free fermion gases are identical to those of the hard - core boson gases , such as those related to the particle density , particle fluctuations of extended regions , and bipartite entanglement entropies of connected parts . therefore , the results of this paper apply to 1d repulsively interacting bose gases as well .    a further interesting issue , worth being investigated , concerns the universality of the behaviors found in this paper , whether some of them are shared with other many - body systems , in particular the small - time asymptotic behaviors of the entanglement entropies and particle fluctuations , which resembles universal behaviors found at equilibrium for systems with central charge @xmath4 . another interesting issue concerns higher - dimensional systems , i.e. the time - dependence of the entanglement entropies during the expansion of gas released by the two or three - dimensional traps .",
