    "in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic , a nearly baryon free environment with high energy density is created in the mid - rapidity region @xcite .",
    "these conditions are favorable for the production of light antinuclei .",
    "production of light antinuclei is thought to be possible primarily via two mechanisms at rhic energies . in the first mechanism ,",
    "nucleus - antinucleus pairs are directly produced in high - energy nucleon - nucleon or partonic collisions .",
    "this mechanism , however , may not contribute to the final observed antinuclei since the small binding energies of the produced antinuclei make them extremely susceptible to break - up in the hot collision zone .",
    "the second and probably dominant mechanism for production of light antinuclei is via final state - coalescence . in this picture ,",
    "antinucleons of similar velocity and proximity bind during the late stages of the collision . in this model",
    ", the production rates for light antinuclei of antinucleon number @xmath2 can be related to the production rates for constituent antinucleons via a coalescence parameter @xmath3 that characterizes the likelihood of antinucleus formation : @xmath4 in the limit where the size of the collision region is smaller than the intrinsic size of the produced antinucleus , the coalescence parameter @xmath3 is calculable from the antinuclear wave function @xcite . in the limit of large systems , however , the coalescence parameter can be related to the size of the system . in general , the coalescence parameter is shown to scale as @xmath5 @xcite where @xmath6 is the effective volume where the antinuclei are produced .",
    "coalescence measurements are similar to hbt in that they give information about the space - time dynamics of the system at freeze - out .",
    "the star detector is well - suited for measurement and identification of relatively rare antinuclei .",
    "the main tracking detector is a large acceptance ( @xmath7 ) time projection chamber(tpc ) .",
    "we identify antinuclei via the ionization ( @xmath8 ) in the tpc .",
    "figure 1 shows the measured @xmath8 plotted against the magnetic rigidity ( @xmath9 ) for negative tracks .",
    "also shown are the expectations for @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0 band is relatively pronounced , and there are 14 counts clustered around the prediction for @xmath11 .",
    "we observe no evidence of a @xmath10 band .",
    "note that we plot here the rigidity , so the mean transverse momentum of the @xmath11 sample is 2.4 gev / c . under the assumption that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are produced in roughly equal numbers and with similar momentum distributions",
    "we would expect that most @xmath10 would be produced in the high rigidity region where they can not be distinguished from more common particles given our @xmath8 resolution .",
    "[ dedx ]    the raw @xmath0 yield is extracted as a function of rapidity ( @xmath12 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath13 ) by fitting the measured @xmath8 distribution to an assumed signal+background form , where the background is from the tail of the @xmath14 @xmath8 distribution . in order to have high @xmath15",
    ", we restrict ourselves to @xmath16 gev / c and @xmath17 .",
    "once we have obtained a raw yield , we apply an efficiency correction , calculated by embedding simulated tracks into real events .",
    "we also correct for @xmath0 absorption in the detector , where we parameterize the @xmath14 absorption in the detector using geant simulations and assume that @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "after corrections , we extract @xmath0 invariant yields for the most central 10% collisions in two @xmath13 bins :    @xmath19 \\\\    & & 1.89\\pm0.19(stat.)\\pm0.47(sys . )",

    "statistics are insufficient to do a differential yield as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "instead , we use all 14 counts to extract an invariant yield at the mean @xmath21 gev / c . to do this , we calculate a cross - section weighted average efficiency over the star acceptance .",
    "we assume a flat rapidity distribution and an exponential @xmath13 spectra with @xmath22 gev .",
    "the efficiency is calculated using embedded tracks in real events , and takes into account the absorption in the detector assuming @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "to increase statistics , we use the top 20% most central events , and extract an invariant yield : @xmath24.\\ ] ] alternatively , the large @xmath13 acceptance for @xmath11 allows us to extract a dn / dy . assuming an exponential @xmath13 distribution and the calculated efficiency , we minimize a log - likelihood function with the total dn / dy as the free parameter . using this procedure ,",
    "we extract for the top 20% most central events @xmath25 .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the extracted dn / dy to the assumed inverse slope parameter , and have found that the final dn / dy differs by less than 10% in the range @xmath26 gev .",
    "@xmath14 yields used for comparison and coalescence calculations were presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we use the measured @xmath14 , @xmath0 , and @xmath11 yields to extract coalescence parameters using equation [ eqn : ba ] .",
    "the @xmath14 yield has been corrected for anti - hyperon feed - down using the hijing event generator to estimate this contribution to the measured @xmath14 yield . for @xmath0 ,",
    "we extract @xmath27 over the measured range @xmath16 gev / c and @xmath17 .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison with previous measurements . comparing to measurements in similar systems at lower energies",
    "we see that the coalescence parameter has dropped by more than a factor of two compared to @xmath0 measurements at sps energies . assuming @xmath28 , the antinucleon freeze - out volume increases by @xmath29 between sps and rhic energies .",
    "combining the measurements of @xmath14 and @xmath11 gives @xmath30 .",
    "this is compared to measurements at lower energies in figure 3 .",
    "na52 has a measurement of @xmath31 for antimatter in nucleus - nucleus , but they observed only 2 counts so the statistics are insufficient for comparison . comparing the current results to the average of the measurements of antimatter and matter at sps energies , a noticeable drop in the coalescence parameter",
    "is observed .",
    "assuming @xmath32 , this corresponds to a @xmath33% increase in the antinucleon freeze - out volume relative to the sps . within the rather large uncertainties ,",
