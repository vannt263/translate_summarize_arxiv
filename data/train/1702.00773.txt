    ": @xcite approached the numerical solution using power series methods .",
    "@xcite published an article later listing seven - digit tables of the numerical solutions of the lane - emden equation for the plane - parallel , cylindrical , and spherical case using a runge - kutta method a work considered a succession to the works of @xcite and @xcite without the aid of electronic computers .",

    "@xcite presented a computational method integrating both the differential transformation method and a modified general formula for the adomian polynomials for solving singular initial - value problems of nonlinear lane - emden type equations .",
    "recently , @xcite used modified rational bernoulli function approximations to solve nonlinear lane - emden equations on the semi - infinite domain .    to avoid the ill - conditioning of differential operators , an alternative direction to the aforementioned methods",
    "is to recast the differential equation into its integral formulation to take advantage of the well - conditioning of integral operators , then discretize the latter using various discretization techniques .",
    "perhaps the first approach in this direction for solving lane - emden equations was presented by @xcite in 2006 , using legendre wavelet approximations and the gaussian integration method .",

    "the proposed method employs shifted gegenbauer polynomial expansions to directly discretize the integral forms of problems 1 and 2 on @xmath22 $ ] , and adopts collocations in the nodal space at the shifted flipped - gegenbauer - gauss - radau ( sfggr ) points to overcome the singularity of the lane - emden equation at the origin that reflects the main difficulty , and to accurately impose the boundary condition at @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , instead of directly integrating both sides of eqs . and , the proposed method follows closely the method of @xcite by introducing a useful substitution to the second - order solution derivative , solving problems 1 and 2 in terms of the new substituting function , and then stably recovering the original solution function via successive integration .",
    "all necessary integral evaluations are accomplished using some newly developed sfggr - based shifted gegenbauer integration matrices .",
    "this approach entails the approximation of the 1- and 2-fold integrals of the solution and substituting functions , whereas the former approach may require the evaluation of the 1- and 2-fold integrals of highly nonlinear and intricate integrands .",

    "the numerical simulations of examples 1 and 3 manifest that @xmath298 increases monotonically for increasing values of @xmath151 with a swelling rate of increase for increasing positive values of @xmath188 .",
    "for instance , the value of @xmath298 of example 1 jumps from about @xmath313 at @xmath314 and @xmath315 into more than @xmath316 at @xmath317 for the same value of @xmath151 .",

    "we draw the attention of the reader also to the significant observation pointed out by @xcite that the gegenbauer quadratures employed in the discretization process ` may become sensitive to round - off errors for positive and large values of the parameter @xmath188 due to the narrowing effect of the gegenbauer weight function , ' which drives the quadratures to become more extrapolatory and possibly give rise to poor integral approximations . on the other hand",

    "that is , gegenbauer basis polynomials associated with negative values of @xmath188 generally lead to more well conditioned linear systems than their rival chebyshev and legendre bases polynomials as @xmath151 tends to infinity .",
