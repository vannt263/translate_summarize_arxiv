    "the saddle - point method is one of the most essential tools in statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "when comparing different statistical ensembles , it is used with overwhelming success in both fundamental theoretical considerations and practical calculations  @xcite . yet",
    ", the conventional form of this usually easy - to - handle approximation fails in the case of condensed ideal bose gases  @xcite ; for instance , it does not yield the correct fluctuation of the number of condensate particles  @xcite .    to elucidate the reason for this failure we consider an ideal bose gas with single - particle energies @xmath0 , with @xmath1 labeling the individual energy eigenvalues . since the grand canonical partition function @xmath2 generates the canonical partition functions @xmath3 by means of the expansion @xmath4",
    "each @xmath5-particle partition function @xmath3 can be represented , according to cauchy s theorem , by a contour integral in the complex @xmath6-plane , @xmath7 where the path of integration encircles the origin counter - clockwise . as usual",
    ", @xmath8 is the inverse temperature . denoting the negative logarithm of the integrand as @xmath9 , i.e. , writing @xmath10 or @xmath11 the saddle - point @xmath12",
    "is determined by the requirement that this function becomes stationary , @xmath13 giving @xmath14 apart from the appearance of one extra particle on the left hand side , this is just the grand canonical relation between particle number  @xmath5 and fugacity  @xmath12 .",
    "proceeding according to folk wisdom , one then expands the logarithm @xmath9 quadratically around @xmath12 and leads the path of integration parallel to the imaginary axis over the saddle , relying on the fact that for large  @xmath5 the main contribution to the integral  ( [ zin ] ) is collected in the immediate vicinity of the saddle - point  @xcite , so that the quadratic expansion should prove sufficient . doing the remaining gaussian integral , one arrives at the standard saddle - point approximation @xmath15 to the canonical partition functions , @xmath16 here and in the following we write @xmath17 for the @xmath18-th derivative of a function  @xmath19 at a saddle - point ; we have used @xmath20 .",
    "hence , one finds @xmath21 from which the canonical occupation number @xmath22 of the state  @xmath23 is obtained by differentiating once with respect to @xmath24 , @xmath25 as long as the gas is not condensed , the fourth term in the approximation  ( [ lsp ] ) remains small in comparison to the third , and therefore may be neglected",
    ". then the partial derivative @xmath26 vanishes as a consequence of the saddle - point equation  ( [ sa1 ] ) , and one is left with @xmath27 so that within these approximations the canonical occupation numbers equal their grand canonical counterparts .    however , this reasoning breaks down for temperatures below the onset of bose ",
    "einstein condensation , where eq .",
    "( [ sa1 ] ) requires that @xmath28 be on the order of @xmath29 , so that the third and the fourth term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lsp ] ) are of comparable magnitude , namely of the order @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the argument that led to the familiar formula  ( [ won ] ) becomes invalid .",
    "moreover , inspecting the higher derivatives of @xmath9 at the saddle - point , @xmath31 \\ ; ,   \\label{der}\\ ] ] one finds that in the condensate regime these derivatives grow dramatically with increasing  @xmath18 , @xmath32 , casting doubt on the validity of the saddle - point approximation even if higher - order terms are included  @xcite . however , for the derivation of an asymptotic series the convergence properties of the formal taylor series of @xmath9 are irrelevant  @xcite ; what actually endangers the approximation scheme  ( [ wsa ] ) in the condensate regime is the narrow approach of the saddle - point to the ground - state singularity @xmath33 of the grand canonical partition function  ( [ gpf ] ) .",
    "namely , the gaussian integral  ( [ wsa ] ) can well represent the exact expression  ( [ zin ] ) only if the function @xmath9 is free of singularities at least in those intervals where the gaussian is still large , i.e. , where @xmath34 is on the order of unity .",
    "since @xmath35 , this observation translates into the requirement that _ the function @xmath9 should be regular at least in an interval of order @xmath36 around @xmath12_. on the other hand , _ in the condensate regime the singularity at @xmath33 falls within a distance of order @xmath36 from the saddle - point @xmath12 _ , again as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ sa1 ] ) .",
    "it is this conflict , _ not _ the poor behavior of the taylor expansion of @xmath9 , which necessitates an approach to the contour integral  ( [ zin ] ) that is essentially more careful than the standard scheme  ( [ wsa ] ) . interestingly ,",
    "though , the dilemma does not appear to be overly severe  the magnitude of both conflicting intervals being of the _ same _ order @xmath36  , and one might wonder already at this point whether the usual procedure can be saved by simple means .    the failure of the saddle - point approximation  ( [ wsa ] ) for condensed bose gases has been the subject of a long debate in the literature  @xcite , with notable early contributions by dingle  @xcite and fraser  @xcite .",
    "various schemes have been designed for computing the number of condensate particles , and its fluctuation , for gases with a fixed number  @xmath5 of particles , _ without _ resorting to the saddle - point method .",
    "quite recently , navez _ et al .",
    "_ have suggested a statistical ensemble within which one regards the condensate as an infinite particle reservoir for the excited - states subsystem  @xcite , thus putting into shape an idea already expressed by fierz  @xcite . in a mathematical setting , each excited single - particle level @xmath37 then becomes formally equivalent to a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath38 , which allows one to derive elegant integral representations for canonical and microcanonical expectation values : setting @xmath39 for convenience , restricting oneself to temperatures below the onset of condensation , and introducing the spectral zeta function @xmath40 with the sum running over the excited states only , the canonical number of condensate particles can be written as  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the path of integration up the complex @xmath43-plane lies to the right of all poles of the integrand , so that the residues of these poles , taken from right to left , yield a systematic expansion of the integral  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the canonical mean - square fluctuation of the number of condensate particles takes the form @xmath44 and the difference between canonical and microcanonical fluctuations is given by @xmath45 ^ 2 }      { \\frac{1}{2\\pi i } \\int_{\\tau - i\\infty}^{\\tau+i\\infty } \\ !",

    "firstly , since eqs .",
    "( [ icn ] ) , ( [ icf ] ) , and ( [ idf ] ) rely on the presence of a reservoir of condensate particles , they are blind to the onset of bose  einstein condensation , that is , to the sudden appearance of this reservoir ; as a consequence of this underlying `` oscillator approximation '' , they do not allow one to discuss just how such a sharp feature can emerge in a bose gas with a large , fixed number of particles . secondly ,",
    "for a given single - particle spectrum the integrals may not always be straightforward to evaluate ; already the treatment of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential , in which case @xmath46 is related to zeta functions of the barnes type  @xcite , requires quite some analytical skills .",
    "therefore , one desires a tool that works , in principle , for all temperatures , and is easy to use in practical calculations .",
    "the development of such a tool is the objective of the present paper . following a trail pioneered by dingle  @xcite",
    ", we work out and test a variant of the saddle - point method that fulfills the above two requirements .",
    "our guiding maxim is the same which already governed london s classic analysis  @xcite of the condensation phenomenon : if the ground state is causing trouble , single it out and give it a special treatment  which , in our case , means to exempt the ground - state factor of the grand canonical partition function  ( [ gpf ] ) from the quadratic expansion performed in the usual scheme  ( [ wsa ] ) , and to treat that factor exactly .",
    "as will be demonstrated in detail , this natural strategy leads to an approach to the canonical and the microcanonical statistics of condensed bose gases which is both extremely accurate and unsurpassed in computational ease .",
    "we proceed as follows : in the next section we will first explain _ why _ and _ how _ this proper saddle - point approximation works for the calculation of the canonical partition functions , and how known limiting cases are recovered , concentrating key technical details in appendices  [ aa ] and  [ ab ] .",
    "we then apply the method to computing canonical occupation numbers and their fluctuations , illustrating the analytical results by numerical calculations for an ideal bose gas confined by an isotropic harmonic potential . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we turn to the microcanonical ensemble , and show how the very same refined saddle - point approach allows one to obtain the interesting quantities almost without further effort .",
    "the final section  [ s4 ] summarizes the most important findings .",
    "although our discussion is led along the lines of the ideal bose gas , and although some interesting physical insights will turn up  in particular , it will become clear why the canonical occupation numbers are well described by the expression  ( [ won ] ) , and thus essentially equal to their grand canonical analogues , even for temperatures below the onset of condensation , where the previous argument had failed ",
    ", this is not primarily a work on the ideal bose gas as such .",
    "rather , major emphasis lies on the mathematics of saddle - point integrals with a singular integrand , of which condensed bose gases provide perhaps the most prominent examples ; we hope that the detailed exposition presented here will prove fruitful also in other areas of mathematical physics where similar problems arise .",
    "since the conventional approximation  ( [ wsa ] ) is thwarted by the fact that the saddle - point  @xmath12 , i.e. , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ sa1 ] ) , approaches the ground - state singularity @xmath33 of the integrand  ( [ int ] ) within order @xmath36 in the condensate regime , we now exclude the ground - state contribution from the quadratic expansion of the logarithm  ( [ log ] ) .",
    "that is , we define @xmath47 and write the canonical @xmath5-particle partition function as @xmath48 the key idea for treating integrals of this kind , due to dingle  @xcite , is to let the potentially dangerous denominator stand as it is , and to expand only the tempered function @xmath49 around the saddle - point  @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting approximation to @xmath3 will then be valid for _ all _ temperatures : for high  @xmath50 , when the saddle - point moves away from the singularity , it is of no concern whether or not the denominator is included in the gaussian approximation ; in the condensate regime its exclusion is crucial .",
    "let us first check the behavior of the derivatives @xmath51 . when omitting the ground - state term ( @xmath52 ) from the sum in eq .",
    "( [ der ] ) , the behavior of the remaining sum is governed in the condensate regime by the following terms ( @xmath53 ) , each of them being about proportional to the @xmath18-th power of temperature . hence , @xmath54^{1/n }      \\propto k_b t \\ ; , \\label{pr1}\\ ] ] with approximate @xmath50-proportionality holding the better , the larger  @xmath18 , since large  @xmath18 emphasize the low - lying states .",
    "now we focus on systems with single - particle energies of the form  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 are integer quantum numbers .",
    "the dimensionless anisotropy coefficients @xmath57 should be of comparable magnitude , the lowest of them equaling unity .",
    "this class of systems contains , e.g. , a gas of @xmath5  ideal bose particles confined by a @xmath58-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential ( @xmath59 ) , or by a @xmath58-dimensional hard box ( @xmath60 ) . for @xmath61 and large  @xmath5",
    "there is a sharp onset of bose  einstein condensation , with @xmath62 in the condensate regime ; @xmath63 is the total number of excited particles  @xcite .",

    "as expected , @xmath75 approaches the value @xmath76 fairly rapidly with  @xmath18 . for comparison ,",
    "1 also shows the corresponding data for a gas with the same number of particles which is stored in a one - dimensional harmonic potential .",
    "its temperature is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 this is a borderline case : for @xmath79 there is no sharp onset of bose ",
    "einstein condensation , so that @xmath80 merely plays the role of a characteristic temperature below which the ground - state population becomes significant .",
    "there are logarithmic corrections  @xcite which keep the ratios  @xmath75 below the value @xmath81 also for large @xmath18 , but , as seen in the figure , even now @xmath75 rapidly approaches a constant not too far from unity .",
    "we conclude that for systems of the type  ( [ gro ] ) , with @xmath61 , the @xmath82-growth of @xmath83 in the condensate regime is replaced by the somewhat milder @xmath84-growth of @xmath51 when going from @xmath9 to its ground - state - amputated descendant  @xmath49 , so that also the formal taylor expansion of  @xmath49 around the saddle - point  @xmath12 is ill - behaved .    but as already indicated , the properties of the taylor series of @xmath49 are only of secondary importance .",
    "what really matters is that this function does not share the ground - state singularity ; the singular point to be watched now is the one at @xmath85 . since @xmath86 ,",
    "the saddle - point remains separated from that singularity by at least the @xmath5-independent gap @xmath87 .",
    "this guarantees that when quadratically expanding the amputated function @xmath49 , rather than @xmath9 , around @xmath12 , an interval of the required order @xmath88 becomes singularity - free for sufficiently large  @xmath5 ; the higher the temperature ( while remaining in the condensate regime ) , the smaller the gap , and the larger the particle number has to be .",

    "the necessity to abandon the usual saddle - point scheme when exploring canonical or microcanonical statistics of condensed bose gases with @xmath5  particles is brought about by a characteristic dilemma . on the one hand ,",
    "the approach of the saddle - point to the ground - state singularity at @xmath33 of the grand canonical partition function within order @xmath36 may be taken as the very hallmark of bose ",
    "einstein condensation ; on the other , the customary gaussian approximation requires that intervals of order @xmath36 around the saddle - point stay clear of singularities .",
    "the solution to this problem almost suggests itself : if one exempts the ground - state factor of the grand canonical partition function from the gaussian expansion and treats that factor exactly , but proceeds as usual otherwise , then the singular point that now decides the fate of the approximation is the one produced by the first excited state at @xmath85 . since the saddle - point remains pinned below @xmath282 , it remains separated from the decisive singularity at @xmath85 by an @xmath5-independent gap .",
    "this gap is wide enough to get the approximation going if the particle number is sufficiently large , because the required interval of regularity shrinks with increasing  @xmath5 .",
    "the representation  ( [ cpf ] ) of the canonical partition functions can be viewed as the prototype integral expressing this strategy ; the other canonical and microcanonical quantities computed in this work constitute nothing but variations of the same mathematical theme .",
    "the success of this amended saddle - point method hinges on the fact that the emerging integrals with singular integrands can be done exactly ; as explained in appendix  [ aa ] , they lead directly to parabolic cylinder functions .",
    "thus , we have accomplished the two goals set in the introduction : the results  ( [ csa ] ) are easy to use , and provide bona fide approximations to partition functions , occupation numbers , and their fluctuations which are valid at all temperatures  not only in the high - temperature limit or in the condensate regime , but also in the critical temperature range that witnesses the onset of condensation . in particular , the sharpness of the drop of the complementary error function contained in the canonical partition function  ( [ cef ] ) allows one to precisely assess the sharpness of this onset in a bose gas with a finite , fixed number of particles .",
    "the observation that the interval of regularity claimed by the gaussian expansion around the saddle - point is of the same order @xmath36 as the distance of the saddle - point from the ground - state singularity , meaning that the original conflict is not too large , reflects itself in the noteworthy fact that the error of the conventional scheme in the condensate regime is merely a temperature- and system - independent multiplicative constant .",
    "the discovery , made in appendix  [ ab ] , that this constant approaches unity when the multiplicity of the ground - state pole is increased fits in nicely : increasing that multiplicity amounts to considering a bose gas with a multiple - degenerate ground state and thus drives the saddle - point away from the ground - state singularity  the occupation number of each individual of the degenerate states is lowered  , thereby lessening the error of the naive approach .",
    "it is also of interest to compare the workload implied by the proper saddle - point method to that required by other techniques aiming at canonical or microcanonical statistics .",
    "exact recursion relations like eq .",
    "( [ frf ] ) or their microcanonical analogues are invaluable for treating relatively small samples with not substantially more than about 1000 particles  @xcite , but the computation of , e.g. , microcanonical condensate fluctuations by such means for a gas with @xmath277  bosons , as presented in fig .",
    "[ f_11 ] , is entirely out of the question",

    "in contrast , saddle - point techniques always require one numerical step  finding the saddle - point as the root of the respective saddle - point equation  , but once this has been done , the formalism yields all quantities of interest , by means of the ever - same formulas , without further hardship .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that despite all reservations  @xcite piled up in more than half a century since schubert s incisive comments  @xcite , it really is the saddle - point method which , if executed properly , provides the most powerful approach to the statistical mechanics of isolated , condensed ideal bose gases .",
    "having an instrument that reliable and flexible at one s disposal is certainly not merely of mathematical value , but may also have some bearing on experiments with bose ",
    "einstein condensates of dilute atomic vapors which are now becoming routine .",
    "these experiments are mainly done in isolated harmonic traps , in the regime of vapor densities where the atomic interactions , quantified by the @xmath283-wave scattering length  @xmath284 , can be considered as weak : denoting the atom mass as  @xmath285 and the characteristic trap frequency as @xmath74 , and defining the oscillator length @xmath286 which quantifies the extension of the trap s ground state , one has @xmath287 under typical conditions . for example , @xmath288  nm for @xmath289rb  @xcite , giving @xmath290 for a sample of @xmath71 condensate atoms in a shallow trap with @xmath291  s@xmath292 , while @xmath293 .",
    "these two relations place the system in the bogoliubov regime , traditionally associated with the notion of a weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "however , it is feasible to prepare even more weakly interacting samples , either by tuning the scattering length with the help of external magnetic fields  @xcite , or by working with spin - polarized atomic hydrogen  @xcite , which features the unusually low triplet scattering length @xmath294  nm  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath295 in a harmonic trap with @xmath291  s@xmath292 , so that even for @xmath296 hydrogen atoms one finds @xmath297 , indicating the crossover regime from the ideal to the bogoliubov gas .",
    "this crossover should manifest itself , in a non - trivial manner , in the behavior of the condensate fluctuations  @xcite , which also determine what one may aptly term `` the minimum linewidth of an atom laser ''  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be of substantial importance to study condensate fluctuations of _ very weakly interacting bose gases _ , that is , of systems intermediate between the ideal gas and the bogoliubov gas , and to probe whether the difference  ( [ dof ] ) between the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble remains visible there ; in general , this difference should show a pronounced dependence on the trap type  @xcite . in this way , an old , apparently purely academic issue  the non - equivalence of statistical ensembles in the condensate regime",
    " suddenly pops up at the forefront of topical research , in the theory of the atom laser .",
    "seen from the experimental angle , such an enterprise is on the verge of becoming possible ; on the theoretical side , the first requirement is a tool for routinely computing ideal condensate fluctuations within the different ensembles , for traps with various geometries .",
