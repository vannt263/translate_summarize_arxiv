    "air quality and climate change are influenced by the fluxes of green house gases , reactive gas emissions and aerosols in the atmosphere .",
    "the ability to quantify variable , yet hardly observable emission rates is a key problem to be solved for the analysis of atmospheric systems , and typically addressed by elaborate and costly field campaigns or permanently operational observation networks . the temporal evolution of chemistry in the atmosphere is usually modelled by atmospheric chemistry transport models .",
    "optimal simulations are based on techniques of combining numerical models with observations . in meteorological forecast models , where initial values are insufficiently well known , while exerting a high influence on the model evolution , this procedure is termed data assimilation ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is no doubt that the optimization of the initial state is always of great importance for the improvement of predictive skill .",
    "however , especially for chemistry transport or greenhouse gas models with high dependence on the emissions in the troposphere , the optimization of initial state is no longer the only issue .",
    "the lack of ability to observe and estimate surface emission fluxes directly with necessary accuracy is a major roadblock , hampering the progress in predictive skills of climate and atmospheric chemistry models . in order to obtain the best linear unbiased estimation ( blue ) from the model with observations ,",
    "efforts of optimization included the emission rates by spatio - temporal data assimilation have been made .",
    "the first full chemical implementation of the 4d - variational method for atmospheric chemistry initial values is introduced in @xcite .",
    "further , elbern et al .",
    "( @xcite ) took the strong constraint of the diurnal profile shape of emission rates such that their amplitudes and initial values are the only uncertainty to be optimized and then implemented it by 4d - variational inversion .",
    "this strong constraint approach is reasonable because the diurnal evolution of emissions are typically much better known than the absolute amount of daily emissions .",
    "moreover , several data assimilation strategies were designed to adjust ozone initial conditions and emission rates separately or jointly in @xcite .",
    "bocquet et al .",
    "introduced a straightforward extension of the iterative ensemble kalman smoother in @xcite .    in many cases , the better estimations of both the initial state and emission rates",
    "are not always sustained based on appropriate observational network configurations when using popular data assimilation methods , such as 4d - variation and kalman filter and smoother .",
    "it may hamper the optimization by unbalanced weights between the initial state and emission rates , which can , in practice , even result in degraded simulations beyond the time intervall with available observations . the ability to evaluate the suitability of an observational network to control chemical states and emission rates for its optimised designis the a key qualification , which needs to be adressed .    singular value decomposition ( svd ) can help identifying the priorities of observations by detecting the fastest growing uncertainties .",
    "the targeted observations problem is an important topic in the field of numerical weather prediction .",
    "singular vector analysis based on svd was firstly introduced to numerical weather prediction by lorenz ( @xcite ) , who applied it to analyse the largest error growth rates in an idealised atmospheric model .",
    "because of the high cost of computation , the singular vector analysis was not widely applied until 1980s .",
    "later the method of singular vector analysis of states of the meteorological model with high dimension was feasible ( @xcite ) .",
    "in atmospheric chemistry , studies about the importance of observations are still sparse .",
    "khattatov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) firstly analysed the uncertainty of a chemical compositions .",
    "liao et al .",
    "( @xcite ) focused on the optimal placement of observation locations of the chemical transport model . however , singular vector analysis for atmospheric chemistry with emissions is different since emissions play an similarly important role in forecast accuracy with initial values .",
    "goris and elbern ( @xcite ) recently used the singular vector decomposition to determine the sensitivity of the chemical composition to emissions and initial values for a variety of chemical scenarios and integration length .",
    "hence , in this paper , applying the kalman filter and smoother as the desirable data assimilation method we introduce an approach to identify the sensitivities of a network to optimize emission rates and initial values independently and balanced prior to any data assimilation procedure . through singular value decomposition and ensemble kalman filter and smoother",
    ", the computational cost of this approach can be reduced so that it is feasible in practice .",
    "then , by the equivalence between 4d variation and kalman filter for linear models , the approach is also feasible for the data assimilation of adjoint models via 4d variational techniques .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model description ] , we describe the atmospheric transport - diffusion model with emission rates first and then reconstruct the state vector such that the emission rates are included dynamically . in section [ efficiency ] , the theoretical approach derives in order to determine the efficiency of observations or observational network configurations before running any data assimilation procedure . in section [ ensemble efficiency ] , based on the theoretical analysis in section [ efficiency ] ,",
    "we discuss the ensemble approach to evaluate the efficiency of observation configurations and present elementary examples . in section",
    "[ sensitivity ] , we present the approach to identify the sensitivity of observations by determining the directions of maximum perturbation growth to the initial perturbation . in the appendices ,",
    "the above approaches are generalised to continuous - time systems for comprehensive applications .",
    "the chemical tendency equation including emission rates , propagating forward in time , is usually described by the following atmospheric transport model @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nonlinear model operator , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the state vector of chemical constituents and emission rates at time @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the a priori estimate of the state vector of concentrations @xmath2 is given and denoted by @xmath5 , termed background state .",
    "the a priori estimate of emission rates are usually taken from emission inventories , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the tangent linear operator of @xmath1 , the evolution of the perturbation of states @xmath2 and @xmath3 follows the tangent linear model with @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the perturbation evolving from the perturbation of initial state of chemical state @xmath10 and emission rates @xmath11 .",
    "after discretizing the tangent linear model in space , let @xmath12 be the evolution operator or resolvent generated by @xmath7 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the linear solution of with continuous time as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 the dimension of the partial phase space of concentrations and emission rates .",
    "obviously , @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath18 be the observation configuration of @xmath2 and define @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a nonlinear forward observation operator mapping the model space to the observation space . then by linearising the nonlinear operator @xmath21 as @xmath22 , the linearised model equivalents of observation configurations can be presented as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 the dimension of the phase space of observation configurations at time @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath26 is the observation error at time @xmath4 of the gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath27 .",
    "it is feasible to apply the kalman filter and smoother into the model without any extension if the emission rates are accurate , which implies the initial state of concentration is the only parameter to be optimized .",
    "however , if the emission rates are poorly known , they should be combined into the state vector so that both of them can be updated by a smoother application . to establish the model with a new combination of the initial state and emissions ,",
    "let us rewrite the background of emission rates into the dynamic form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a @xmath16-dimensional vector of which the @xmath30 element is denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the diagonal matrix defined as @xmath33    since emission rates follow the diurnal variation , by taking the diurnal profile of emission rates as a constraint , the amplitude of emission rates can be estimated by constant emission factors ( @xcite ) .",
    "we reconstruct the dynamic model of emission rate perturbation as @xmath34 then , can be written as @xmath35 hence , we obtain the extended model with emission rates @xmath36    typically , there is no direct observation for emissions .",
    "therefore , we reconstruct the observation mapping as @xmath37\\left(\\begin{array}{c }        \\delta c(t)\\\\       \\delta e(t )        \\end{array } \\right)+\\nu(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a @xmath39 matrix with zero elements .",
    "it is clear now that both concentrations and emission rates are included into the state vector of the block extended model , such that the kalman smoother in a fixed time interval @xmath40 $ ] can be applied to optimize both of them . in our approach , the dynamic model of emission rates is forced to follow the background evolution of emission rates .",
    "in fact , it was stated in several studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) that the best linear unbiased estimation ( blue ) of a random variable @xmath41 , which implies this estimation , can minimise its variance . the estimate via fix - interval kalman",
    "smoother is the blue depending on all observation configurations in time interval @xmath40 $ ] . in our case of emission rates , the estimation of @xmath3 by kalman smoother on @xmath40 $ ] can be represented generally as the conditional expectation @xmath42\\}]$ ] . by the linear property of conditional expectation , @xmath43\\}]\\\\&=&e[m_e(t , s)e(s)\\vert \\{y(t),t\\in [ t_0,t_n]\\}]=m_e(t , s)e[e(s)\\vert \\{y(t ) , t\\in [ t_0,t_n]\\}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies the dynamic model of emission rates",
    "satisfies the constraint of the diurnal shape of emission rates if @xmath40 $ ] covers 24 hours .",
    "as mentioned before , the observational network configurations can not necessarily help improving the initial state and emission rates in a balanced way .",
    "if the estimation of both initial state and emission rates can be improved significantly , we call the corresponding observation configurations as efficient or of high efficiency for both . otherwise , the observation configurations are only efficient to initial state or emission rates . however , it is usually difficult to foresee the efficiency of observation configurations .",
    "hence , the lack of the knowledge of the efficiency of observations may lead us to give the poor initial guesses and waste computational resource . in this section",
    ", we will introduce the theoretical approach to determine the efficiency of observations via the kalman filter and smoother in a finite - time interval .      for the application in atmospheric chemistry ,",
    "let us consider the discrete - time system first .",

    ", the statistic interpretation of the inverse of covariance is still blurred to the application .",
    "therefore , for evaluating the improvement of the estimation with the initial variance @xmath69 , we define _ relative improvement covariance _ as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the identity matrix .",
    "the above improvement covariance is a normalised matrix of the difference between the initial variance @xmath69 and the covariance matrix @xmath87 from kalman smoother .",
    "especially , @xmath88 can be understood as the covariance matrix from the fixed - interval kalman smoother normalised by the initial variance .",
    "the symmetric normalised matrix guarantees the improvement covariance to be positive - definite .",
    "further , its singular values or the eigenvalues are bounded since the sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its trace .",
    "in fact , from , we have @xmath89 which implies that its trace is always less than the dimension of the state vector of the model .    since @xmath87 is unknown before the data assimilation procedure is finished , we rewrite the relative improvement covariance as @xmath90    it is clear to see from the improvement covariance defined in that @xmath91 is still invertible even without observability of the system , which means @xmath92 is not full - rank . however , it is not easy to calculate directly . hence , by singular value decomposition , @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are unitary matrices consisted of the left and right singular vectors , @xmath96 is the rectangular diagonal matrix consisting of the singular values .",
    "we can simplify as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the rank of and @xmath99 is the @xmath30 left singular vector in @xmath94 related to the singular value @xmath100 , which is the @xmath30 element on the diagonal of @xmath96 .",
    "let us consider the improvement of each element in the state vector as the corresponding value in the diagonal of the relative improvement covariance . from",
    ", we denote the relative improvement of @xmath101 element in @xmath102 as @xmath103 , then , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the @xmath101 element of @xmath106 .",
    "get a deeper insight into the capacity of the observation networks to improve the estimation of all states of the model , some important indices need to be considered .",

    "thus , if we consider the ratio @xmath112 the percentage of the total improvement of the model is obtained , which is called the _ relative improvement degree_.      for the atmospheric transport model extended with emissions , composing the dimension of the original state @xmath113 and emission rates @xmath114 respectively , we divide into a block matrix @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the relative improvement covariance of the state @xmath117 , @xmath118 is the relative improvement covariance of the emission rates @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the relative improvement covariance between @xmath117 and @xmath119 and @xmath121 .",

    "the relative improvement degree can not serve our objective to distinguish the observability of concentration and emission rates and balance them quantitatively . however , by observing the block form of @xmath138 , it is easy to obtain @xmath139 for comparing the improvement of the concentration and emission rates , we define _ relative improvement ratios _ for the state or the emission rates as @xmath140    in a sum , if the total improvement value or relative improvement degree of the model is almost zero , the relative improvement ratios do not need to be considered since no state of the model is improved .",
    "otherwise , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which show the improvement of each parameter @xmath143 of concentrations and emission rates respectively , can help us determining which parameters can be optimized by the existing observation configurations . by comparing @xmath144 with @xmath145 ,",
    "it is clear that the estimation of the one with the larger ratio ( larger magnitude of the improvement covariance ) can be improved more efficiently by the existing observation configurations .",
    "in other words , if @xmath146 , the existing observation configurations are more sensible to the initial values of concentration .",
    "conversely , if @xmath147 , the observation configurations can help improving the estimation of emission rates more . according to @xmath144 and @xmath145 ,",
    "the weight between the concentrations and emission rates can be decided quantitatively . in a data assimilation context , where observations are in a weighted relation to the background , the blue favours the more sensitive parameters .    in a special case",
    "that @xmath145 is very close to zero , the emission rates can be viewed as the input in the model without any optimization when the data assimilation procedure is started .    for the completion of the theorem and wider application ,",
    "the generalisation of the above method for the continuous - time system is introduced in appendix a. while the derivation is totally different from the discrete - time system , it can be shown that the theoretical analysis still holds for the continuous - time system .",
    "in practice , the standard kalman filter and smoother can not be applied directly to transport modells due to their computational complexity .",
    "the ensemble kalman filter ( enkf ) and smoother ( enks ) , as a monte carlo implementation originating from kalman filter and smoother , are suitable for problems with a large number of control variables and are an important tool in the field of data assimilation ( @xcite ) . in this section",
    ", we will introduce how to apply the above method if an ensemble kalman filer and smoother are applied as the data assimilation method .    for the abstract discrete - time system",

    "correspondingly , their ensemble means are @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a @xmath155 matrix where each element is equal to @xmath156 .",
    "note the ensemble perturbation matrix consist of the perturbation of each sampling by @xmath157 then the ensemble covariance is @xmath158    further , we define the ensemble observation equivalent in the entire time interval in observation space as @xmath159 and denote the ensemble mean and the forecast error covariance matrix in observation space by @xmath160 similarly , we denote the ensemble covariance between the initial states and the forecasting observations by @xmath161    in addition , we define the ensemble observations as @xmath162 and assume @xmath163 denote the ensemble covariance of observation errors by @xmath164 further , we assume @xmath165    it is shown by evensen ( @xcite ) that the ensemble forecasting and analysis covariances have the same form with the covariances in the standard kalman filter .",
    "it indicates that and are also true for @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "so upon substituting @xmath168 into @xmath69 in , according to matrix inversion lemma , we obtain @xmath169 then , @xmath170    to simplify , let @xmath171 , by singular value decomposition , we have @xmath172 where @xmath173 consists of the eigenvectors of @xmath174 , @xmath175 consists of the eigenvectors of @xmath176 , @xmath177 consists of the singular values .",

    "further on , it is worth noticing that if the ensemble size @xmath152 is less than the dimension of the model @xmath16 , the initial ensemble covariance @xmath168 is not invertible . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to replace @xmath183 by the pseudo inverse of @xmath184 , denoted by @xmath185 , and calculate it by singular value decomposition .",

    "it is clear from that @xmath203 is still nonnegative definite while @xmath168 is not with full rank , so if we use the same notation of standard kalman filter and smoother to denote the ensemble relative improvement covariance , which means @xmath204 then , @xmath205 further , the _ ensemble relative improvement degree _ is @xmath206    as to the atmospheric transport model extended with emissions , for the distinction of the improvements for concentrations and emission rates , the _ ensemble relative ratios _ are still @xmath207    if we further consider the nonlinear dynamic model , we can renew the definition of the forecasting observation configurations as @xmath208 such that it can fully follow the nonlinear model , where @xmath182 is a nonlinear operator .    correspondingly , its ensemble mean and covariance are @xmath209    thus , for a nonlinear dynamic model , the extended ensemble kalman filter to the theoretical approach in section [ efficiency ] , the only approximation is the limited size of the ensemble .",
