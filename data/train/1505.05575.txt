    "finding practical and principled methods to numerically solve the many - electron schrdinger equation for realistic chemical systems is a substantial problem that has been attacked by the scientific community for more than five decades now .",
    "though diverse in approach , the bulk of these methods can be classified as either being based on the single - particle density @xmath0 or the many - body wavefunction @xmath1 .",
    "kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft)@xcite and the coupled cluster theory ( cc)@xcite are two remarkably successful examples of these former and latter categories . despite their merits and widespread use ,",
    "by now it s become well established these classes of methods have their respective limitations that are unlikely to be overcome in the near future .",
    "for instance cc theory , though being the gold standard for weakly correlated systems , can not successfully account for multi - reference effects present in strongly correlated molecules and solids , and its computational scaling seems to limit use for large systems .",
    "dft in contrast is computationally affordable@xcite , but is plagued by a lack of systematic approaches to improve functionals@xcite , as well as the fact that many approximate functionals can give a frustratingly non - uniform performance across different systems and properties .",
    "this problem is exemplified for metal oxides , where even within the same system different dft approximations are required for different properties@xcite .",
    "furthermore , as spectral properties are concerned , even with the exact functional the kohn - sham ( ks ) gap can not provide a theoretically sound approximation to the fundamental gap@xcite .",
    "approaches based on the self - consistent single - particle green s function , @xmath2 , are an attractive alternative with strengths and weaknesses that are complementary to density and wavefunction - based methods .",
    "similar to dft , green s function methods can be implemented in a blackbox manner in the atomic orbital ( ao ) basis@xcite , and typically will feature lower order polynomial scaling than wavefunction - based methods such as ccsd ( coupled cluster singles doubles ) .",
    "additionally , green s function methods offer a natural language for embedding approaches since the green s function can be partitioned among subsystems ( similar to the density ) .    because of the need to evaluate @xmath3 on a numerical grid , @xmath4 , green s function",
    "based approaches can be broadly grouped into two classes :    _ greens functions on the imaginary ( matsubara grid ) axis _ describe a grand canonical ensemble and can be used to calculate temperature dependent quantities such as the free energy , specific heat , etc .",
    "a green s function of the imaginary axis is a smooth function , with only a single pole near zero that is not accessed for any finite temperature larger than zero .",
    "consequently , the imaginary axis formulation is a natural choice for any self - consistent approach where the green s function is expressed as a functional of the self - energy , @xmath5 $ ] , and where at self - consistency infinite classes of diagrams can be included due to the implicit resummation .",
    "a result of this diagrammatic resummation is that these approaches@xcite give finite results in strongly correlated cases when other methods such as truncated cc or mp2 ( second order mller - plesset@xcite ) would diverge pathologically .",
    "_ greens functions on the real frequency axis _ are more commonly employed in quantum chemistry for zero - temperature calculations .",
    "the single - particle green s function on the real axis has multiple poles which correspond to ionization potential ( ip ) and electron affinity ( ea ) peaks  @xcite in the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "the two - particle real - axis green s function is capable of describing optical / neutral excitations .",
    "performing the calculation self - consistently ( where @xmath5 $ ] is evaluated as a functional of @xmath6 ) is notoriously difficult on the real axis , because the series of poles in the real - axis green s function requires a non - uniform grid that can change between iterations .",
    "the real and imaginary axis formalisms should be treated as complementary but requiring the development of different tools in order to evaluate accurate green s functions .",
    "the interesting question that arises is if one can use an approach that has ",
    "the best of both worlds \" ; that is , to calculate the green s function on the imaginary axis in order to take advantage of the efficient self - consistency , and to subsequently employ the imaginary axis solution to calculate spectra on the real axis .",
    "one of the routes to obtaining a real axis green s function from the imaginary axis data is through the process of analytic continuation  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is known to suffer from several problems , namely it can not recover sharp spectral features , frequently is problematic in recovering fundamental gap edges , and is very sensitive to the initial imaginary axis data .    here",
    ", we attempt to examine an alternative answer to this problem",
    ". we will investigate how accurately and reliably one can calculate quasiparticle spectra from the extended koopman s theorem ( ekt)@xcite starting from self - consistent green s function many - body theory@xcite in an imaginary axis implementation .",
    "the ekt is valuable because it allows one to obtain , in principle , both ips and eas from a single electronic structure calculation on the neutral system .",
    "similar to population analysis@xcite , the actual ekt procedure itself takes place in a simple post - calculation analysis , utilizing the density matrix and other quantities obtained by the preceding correlated method . as a result",
    "the ekt can be implemented in a blackbox manner , requires only a negligible fraction of time , and is not tied to any particular level of theory . despite its simplicity , most of the efforts so far seem to have focused on its application for calculating ips only@xcite .",
    "while an interesting benchmark of the ekt for eas has appeared recently@xcite , in that work bozkaya actually obtained the ea _ indirectly _ by calculating the ip of the anion . in contrast , in this work we will calculate ips and eas from the neutral system via the ekt .",
    "as far as we are aware , eas typically have not been calculated in this manner .    while the ekt has usually been formulated in terms of a generalized fockian@xcite that is evaluated using methods such as configuration interaction ( ci ) or mp2 , in this work we approach ekt with the machinery of second order green s function theory ( gf2 )  @xcite . as shown by dahlen , stan , and van leeuwen@xcite , via ekt",
    "it is possible to calculate both ips and eas from the imaginary time green s function of the neutral system alone .",
    "this is potentially very useful for studying the spectral properties of extended systems , because it would circumvent the numerically ill defined step of analytic continuation to the real axis . while their initial results for ips obtained with gf2 and gw were promising , here",
    "we intend to examine gf2 s performance for ips and eas for a wider group of atoms and small molecules .",
    "to make this work self - contained , here we briefly review some of the different strategies that have been utilized to calculate ips , eas , and the fundamental gap @xmath7 , using wavefunction theory , dft , many - body theory , and combinations thereof .",
    "naively , the simplest strategy for obtaining these quantities would be by energy differences of the neutral and charged cation / anion systems .",
    "however this is fundamentally problematic for periodic boundary - conditions ( pbc ) calculations of materials in the solid - state , where it would imply the presence of an infinite amount of unbalanced charge in the crystal . even for finite systems , careful early ci studies@xcite found that obtaining accurate eas from energy - differences was particularly challenging because the correlation energy of the anion could converge appreciably slower than that of the neutral system .",
    "additionally , methods with significant amounts of self - interaction error ( such as approximate dft ) may not be able to bind some anions at all@xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", significant interest has been placed in obtaining ips and eas _ directly _ from a single calculation on the neutral system .",
    "an exemplar for this is offered by the equation of motion coupled cluster theory ( eom - cc)@xcite for electron attachment and removal@xcite .",
    "eom - cc is a generalization of the original coupled cluster theory to charged and neutral excitations , and thus largely inherits the advantages and disadvantages of the cc method : if a single determinant description is valid , and the calculation not prohibitively expensive , one can expect very accurate results .",
    "closely related to ip / ea - eom - cc is the coupled cluster green s function method of nooijen and snijders@xcite , that again will bear some of the advantages and disadvantages of the underlying cc theory .    in the same spirit ,",
    "green s function ( also called electron propagator ) methods such as the n@xmath8-order algebraic diagrammatic approximation ( adc(n))@xcite and various self - energy approximations@xcite have found regular use for the accurate , direct determination of ips and eas in finite systems@xcite . typically the underlying scheme in these methods is the iterative diagonalization of the self - energy on the real axis in the molecular orbital ( mo ) basis , @xmath9 , until one converges to a given ip , @xmath10 . as such , this is quite distinct from the fully self - consistent green s function implementations in the local ao basis that have appeared recently@xcite and that we are considering presently in this work .    a theoretically not fully justified however computationally cheap strategy for directly obtaining quasiparticle spectra would be to simply perform a dft calculation on the neutral system , and then interpret the resulting ks eigenvalues as ips and eas . unfortunately",
    ", as previously mentioned there is no rigorous theoretical grounding for such a procedure@xcite : even if the exact functional were used , while the highest occupied ks orbital eigenvalue would be the negative of the ionization potential , the ks gap @xmath11 would still differ from the exact fundamental gap @xmath12 by an amount equalling the derivative discontinuity of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential , @xmath13 .",
    "as shown recently with stretched hydrogen chains , when strong correlation is present the derivative - discontinuity @xmath14 can actually become the dominant contribution to @xmath12@xcite . if one disregards this principled objection , in practice the ks gap still underpredicts the fundamental gap significantly , which is partly a consequence of the fractional - charge error in approximate density functionals@xcite .",
    "because hartree - fock and ks dft tend to have opposing fractional - charge errors , these methods will typically overestimate and underestimate the fundamental gap , respectively .",
    "for this reason there will almost always be a system - dependent empirical hybrid functional that will describe the fundamental gap well@xcite when calculated in the generalized kohn - sham ( gks)@xcite formalism as band energy - differences . from this standpoint",
    "it s understandable why the hse functional@xcite has enjoyed so much success for many insulators and semiconductors@xcite , though it s been remarked the hse gap will tend to match the optical gap better than the fundamental gap@xcite .",
    "because of these fundamental issues with the ks eigenvalues , a very commonly used strategy has been to perform `` one - shot '' corrections to the dft spectra with the @xmath15 approximation@xcite . from a purely pragmatic viewpoint",
    "the resulting quasiparticle spectra can be much improved with respect to experiment .",
    "however from a principled standpoint this is not entirely satisfying because it is highly dependent on the starting dft solution which is functional dependent . because of this , the @xmath15 results can vary significantly depending on the combination of system and density functional used@xcite . to highlight one such example , for hematite ( @xmath16-fe@xmath17o@xmath18 )",
    "the @xmath15 correction can yield quasiparticle gaps ranging from 1.3 , 4.0 , to 4.5  ev depending on whether pbe@xcite , hse@xcite , or pbe0@xcite is used , respectively , which is contrasted with the experimentally determined gap of 2.6@xmath190.4  ev@xcite . though controversy exists in whether self - consistency will overall improve or worsen results@xcite , clearly fully self - consistent green s function calculations are valuable because they are reference independent .",
    "we review one such self - consistent implementation next .",
    "the real axis single - particle green s function , @xmath2 , determines the expectation value of all single - particle observables , in addition to the spectral density of states , ips , and eas .",
    "unfortunately , calculating @xmath2 exactly for a large system is not any more feasible than calculating the exact wavefunction @xmath1 .",
    "nonetheless _ we can _ calculate the green s function of a non - interacting system , @xmath20 , very easily , and then correct it for the missing many - body correlation effects in a systematic way via the dyson equation .",
    "given some @xmath21 , the exact @xmath2 can be obtained by expanding in terms of the proper self - energy , @xmath6 , and analytically summing to yield the dyson equation    @xmath22^{-1}\\\\ \\end{split } \\label{eq : dysonsum}\\ ] ]    the self - energy , @xmath6 , is a frequency - dependent single - particle potential that encompasses all of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) effects of the many - body system .",
    "analogous to the ks potential @xmath23 , one could think of @xmath6 as being the xc potential that connects the green s function of the non - interacting system to the green s function of the fully interacting system .",
    "however , it is important to remember that @xmath6 is dynamic , nonlocal , and orbital - dependent , while @xmath23 in approximate dft is typically static , `` semilocal '' , and density - dependent . in principle",
    "the exact @xmath6 can be expanded diagrammatically in @xmath2@xcite . in a practical implementation ,",
    "one chooses a subset of diagrams that can be evaluated in a computationally tractable manner .",
    "the resulting self - energy can then be written as an approximate functional of the green s function , @xmath24 $ ] , yielding a self - consistent set of equations . in this work",

    "because gf2 is defined in terms of the bare coulomb interaction rather than the screened interaction as in gw , this suggests that the cause of the systematic underestimation of quasiparticle spectra by self - consistent vs non - self - consistent green s function methods may be more general than being specifically the result of over or underscreening caused by a series of bubble diagrams present in the the gw approach .",

    "<S> one - body green s function theories implemented on the real frequency axis offer a natural formalism for the unbiased theoretical determination of quasiparticle spectra in molecules and solids . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent green s function methods employing the imaginary axis formalism on the other hand can benefit from the iterative implicit resummation of higher order diagrams that are not included when only the first iteration is performed . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the imaginary axis green s function does not give direct access to the desired quasiparticle spectra , which undermines its utility . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how reliably one can calculate quasiparticle spectra from the extended koopmans theorem ( ekt ) applied to the imaginary time green s function in a second order approximation ( gf2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ekt in conjunction with gf2 yields ips and eas that systematically underestimate experimental and accurate coupled - cluster reference values for a variety of molecules and atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes that the ekt allows one to utilize the computational advantages of an imaginary axis implementation , while still being able to acquire real axis spectral properties . because the ekt requires negligible computational effort , and can be used with a green s function from any level of theory , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is a potentially very useful tool for the systematic study of quasiparticle spectra in realistic systems . </S>"
