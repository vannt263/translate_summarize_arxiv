    "x - ray binaries harbour compact objects and their x - ray luminosity is believed to be generated due to an accretion disk formed by material accreted from a companion star .",
    "the x - ray emission is known to vary on a wide range of timescales .",
    "it was after the launch of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( rxte ) satellite , that millisecond variability was detected in several sources ( for reviews see for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray variability is typically quantified in the frequency domain by computing the power density spectra .",
    "the power density spectrum sometimes shows peaked features which are termed as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in some neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , there are qpos observed in the frequency range of 400 to 1300 hz , and these are termed as kilohertz qpos . often two simultaneous khz qpos are observed in a system , with the higher - frequency one being called the ` upper khz qpo ' while the lower - frequency one is called the ` lower khz qpo ' . in general , the quality factor ,",
    "@xmath2 , which is the ratio of the qpo frequency to the full width at half maximum , of the lower khz qpo is significantly greater than the upper one @xcite .",
    "there have been several models invoked to explain this twin khz qpo phenomena .",
    "a list of different models with their merits and demerits has been presented by @xcite . here",
    "we briefly mention some of them . in the sonic - point model",
    "@xcite with modifications @xcite , the frequency of the upper khz qpo is interpreted as the keplerian one at the sonic radius , while the frequency of lower khz qpo is generated by the modulation of the upper qpo with the neutron star spin frequency . in this interpretation , the frequency separation between the upper and lower khz qpo should be a constant , but almost all sources show significant variation in the separation .",
    "for example , for the lmxb 4u 1608 - 52 a linear relation between the upper and lower khz qpo has been reported @xcite . the relativistic precession model @xcite identifies the upper khz qpo frequency as a keplerian one with the lower khz qpo generated due to modulation of the keplerian frequency with the relativistic periastron precession frequency . in the two - oscillator model @xcite",
    ", the lower khz qpo is due to a blob moving in a keplerian orbit , and the upper khz qpo is generated by the influence of the coriolis force on the blob when it enters the neutron star s rotating magnetosphere .",
    "later , @xcite refined this model by connecting the qpo to a rayleigh - taylor gravity wave .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the accretion disk around a rapidly rotating compact object may be misaligned beyond a transition radius due to the bardeen - petterson effect and this gives rise to the qpo phenomenon",
    ".    there have also been attempts to understand these qpos as global oscillation in the disk due to hydrodynamic or magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities or waves . in a series of papers , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the qpo is explained to be generated by a resonant excitation caused by the non - linear interactions between the disk oscillation modes .",
    "the phenomena has been attributed to alfven wave oscillations @xcite or to standing modes of mhd waves @xcite .",
    "the rossby wave instability in the inner disk has also been invoked @xcite . @xcite",
    "have tried to explain the qpos in terms of a resonant coupling of mhd oscillation modes with the neutron star spin . @xcite",
    "have performed mhd simulations to understand the phenomena .",
    "apart from theoretical consistences , the validity of these different models can in principle be tested with observations .",
    "a model should explain the observed relationships between the twin khz qpo frequencies and any other lower frequency qpos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it may also need to explain the strength of the khz qpos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the condition for the appearance of two khz qpos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , there is no consensus that any of the models is the most favourable one .",
    "this is primarily because none of the models have a clear predictive and distinguishing signature which can be tested against these observations .",
    "it is also not clear how does a dynamical oscillation proposed by these different models , couples to the radiative process that produces the x - ray emission .",
    "relatively fewer studies have been undertaken to identify the radiative mechanism that is responsible for the khz qpos .",
    "on the other hand , the time averaged spectra of lmxbs have been well studied by several missions .",
    "the primary component has been indisputably identified to be thermal comptonization which typically dominates the spectrum especially at energies @xmath3 kev .",
    "there is a secondary soft competent which could be a multi - coloured disk emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a black body from the boundary layer between the disk and the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra show significant and systematic long term variation which is characterised by shapes ( `` z '' and `` atoll '' ) in the colour - colour and colour - intensity plots .",
    "these variations are primarily due to the main thermal component .",
    "the temperature of the comptonizing medium ranges from @xmath4 kev ( `` soft '' state ) to @xmath5 kev ( `` hard '' state ) while corresponding electron scattering optical depth ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the occurrence of khz qpo has been reported to be related to the spectral shape or more specifically to the position of the source in its colour - colour diagram @xcite .",
    "the detection of the qpos in the long term light curves of sources have also been examined @xcite .",
    "these studies seem to suggest that the qpos are preferentially detected in intermediate spectral states which lie between the extreme soft and hard states . on the other hand ,",
    "statistically analysis undertaken by @xcite suggests that the fraction of segments having a khz qpo is near unity at low states and decreases to zero at high states with nearly constant amplitude . in any case , irrespective of the details mentioned above , the khz qpo is most probably associated with the primary thermal comptonization component which typically dominates the spectra .",
    "the fractional root mean square ( r.m.s ) amplitude of the khz qpos have been measured to be an increasing function of energy @xcite with indications of a decrease at @xmath8 kev @xcite .",
    "this again implies that the phenomenon should be associated with the high energy thermal comptonization component and not the soft black body one .",
    "remarkable evidence was obtained when the time lag between different energy bins for the lower khz qpo was measured to be of the order of @xmath9 micro - seconds @xcite . for thermal comptonization ,",
    "higher energy photons scatter more than the low energy ones and hence one expects time - lags between them . for a corona of size of few kms and optical depths of order unity ,",
    "the expected time difference is of the order of @xmath10 micro - seconds .",
    "it was realised that the variation of the r.m.s and the time - lag as a function of energy is a powerful diagnostic which can distinguish which parameter ( e.g. the plasma temperature , the soft photon input ) drives the oscillation as well as constrain the size and geometry of the system @xcite . for the lmxb 4u 1608 - 52",
    ", the time lag was found to be `` soft '' i.e. the soft photons are delayed compared to the hard ones ( erratum of * ? ? ?",
    "such soft lags were confirmed also for 4u 1636 - 53 @xcite .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction to the thermal comptonization model , where one would expect hard lags .",
    "however , @xcite showed that if a fraction of the comptonized photons impinge back in the soft photon source , then the system would show soft lags with an energy dependence similar to what has been observed .",
    "earlier , time lags for khz qpos were reported for a single rxte observation of 4u 1608 - 52 @xcite and 4u 1636 - 53 @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite has analysed a number of observations of both sources and have confirmed that the time lag is soft and is of the order of tens of micro - secs for the lower khz qpo .",
    "the time lag remains nearly constant till about @xmath11 hz and then decreases as the frequency increases .",
    "@xcite have studied for the first time the time - lag for the upper khz qpo and find them to be hard lags and inconsistent with those seen for the lower khz qpo .",
    "thus , these results ascertain that time - lags in khz qpos is a rich phenomenon which can provide important insight into the nature of these systems .    apart from delays due to electron scatterings in a thermal plasma",
    ", the time - lags could be due to other reasons .",
    "longer time - lags ( @xmath12 msec ) observed in the low frequency continuum @xcite are attributed to propagation of stochastic variability in a disk @xcite or for a low frequency qpo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , time - lag may be due to non - linear dependence of spectral parameters with each other @xcite .",
    "the micro - second time - lags observed for khz qpos are unlikely to be due to any of the above but could be due to reverberation of the x - rays from a reflector which is few kms away from the source @xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasised that since the primary spectral component is due thermal comptonization , time lag due to multiple electron scattering must occur and should be of the order of tens of micro - seconds . thus , while reverberation may contribute to the observed time - lags , the comptonization lag is an important effect , which can not be neglected for khz qpos .    in this work ,",
    "we study using the linearised time dependent kompaneets equation , the response of the thermal plasma to variations in the input photon flux and the plasma heating rate .",
    "for the latter , we also consider the possibility that a fraction of photons impinge back into the input photon source .",
    "the analysis predicts the shape of the r.m.s as a function of energy as well as the expected time - lags as a function of energy .",
    "we apply the method to a test case and show that such analysis can provide constraints on the geometry and size of the system .    in the next section",
    "we develop the mathematical formulation which is followed by  3 where the generic results are presented . in ",
    "4 , as a test case , we apply the method to data from 4u 1608 - 52 to show the utility of such an analysis . in  5 we summarise and discuss the work .",
    "thermal comptonization is a process in which low energy `` seed '' photons are comptonized by a hot thermal electron gas . while the geometry of the comptonizing system in an x - ray binary may be complex , here we assume a simple one , where a spherical seed photon source of radius @xmath13 is surrounded by a comptonizing medium of width @xmath14 and temperature @xmath15 .",

    ", the time - lag is found to be soft and the r.m.s increases monotonically with energy .",
    "such behaviour has been reported for the khz oscillations in lmxbs . as an example , we compare the model predictions with the time - lag and r.m.s observed for the 850 hz oscillation of 4u 1608 - 52 and show that the size of the comptonizing region can be constrained to @xmath1 km .",
    "the analysis shows that modelling the time - lag and r.m.s variation as a function of energy for khz qpos is a powerful technique which can in principle constrain the size and geometry of the source .",
    "a more detailed analysis will require a careful modelling of the time - dependent spectra .",
    "modelling the time - lag as well as the r.m.s at different qpo frequency and taking into account the corresponding spectral changes , may provide information regarding how the size and geometry of the system changes . moreover , while the time - lags for the upper khz qpo have not been constrained , they are known to be significantly different than those of the lower khz qpo and hence should provide additional constraints .",
    "we defer such a detailed analysis to explain the observations reported by @xcite to a latter work .",
    "one may also need to take into account additional effects such as reverberation lags .",
    "the iron line component and the soft disk emission may oscillate in response to the plasma variation after a time - lag . however , it is important to note that even for relatively small plasma size of @xmath133 km , the time - lags due to comptonization is of the order of @xmath10 microseconds and hence they are expected to dominate .",
    "the more subtle and complicated general relativistic effects may also be needed to be incorporated in order to correctly model such systems .    while the qualitative results such as the presence of soft lags do not depend on the time averaged spectral parameters , the constraints obtained on the size and geometry",
    "do depend on their precise values .",
    "thus , it is important to obtain broad band spectral data during the time when a khz qpo has been observed .",
    "this will be possible by the upcoming multi - wavelength satellite astrosat @xcite where the large array x - ray proportional counter will detect the qpo while it and the other x - ray instruments will provide broad band spectra .",

    "<S> we study the energy dependent photon variability from a thermal comptonizing plasma that is oscillating at khz frequencies . in particular , we solve the linearised time dependent kompaneets equation and consider the oscillatory perturbation to be either in the soft photon source or in the heating rate of the plasma . for each case , we self consistently consider the energy balance of the plasma and the soft photon source . </S>",
    "<S> the model incorporates the possibility of a fraction of the comptonized photons impinging back into the soft photon source . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the oscillation is due to the soft photon source , the variation of the fractional root mean sqaure ( r.m.s ) is nearly constant with energy and the time - lags are hard . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the case when the oscillation is due to variation in the heating rate of the corona , and when a significant fraction of the photons impinge back into the soft photon source , the r.m.s increases with energy and the time lags are soft . as an example , we compare the results with the @xmath0 hz oscillation observed on march 3 , 1996 for 4u 1608 - 52 and show that both the observed soft time - lags as well as the r.m.s versus energy can be well described by such a model where the size of the comptonizing plasma is @xmath1 km . </S>",
    "<S> thus , modelling of the time lags as due to comptonization delays , can provide tight constraints on the size and geometry of the system . </S>",
