    "to evaluate the number of events , we integrate numerically the schrdinger equation @xmath13 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\nu_e ( x ) \\\\",

    ", the zenith angle dependence in the atmospheric neutrino anomaly requires that the larger mass squared difference be of order @xmath25ev@xmath2 .",
