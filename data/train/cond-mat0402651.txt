    "this is due to the fact that in those sciences , recent research has focused on the emergence of aggregates like economic institutions , migrations , patterns of behavior , etc .",
    ", as a result of the outcome of dynamical interaction of many individual agent decisions @xcite .",
    "the differences of this approach with traditional studies are twofold : firstly , the fact that collective recognizable patterns are due to _ the interaction of many individuals .",
    "_ on the other hand , in the traditional neoclassical picture , agents are assumed to be hyperrational and have infinite information about other agents intentions . under these circumstances , individuals jump directly into the steady state .",
    "however individuals are far from being hyperrational and their behavior often changes over time .",
    "thus , new models consider explictly _ the dynamical approach towards the steady state _ through evolution , adaptation and/or learning of individuals .",
    "the dynamical nature of the problem poses new questions like whether individuals are able to reach a steady state and under which circumstances this steady state is stable .",
    "the problem is thus very appealing to statistical mechanics researchers , since it is the study of many interacting degrees of freedom for which powerful tools and intuitions had been developed .",
    "however , the dynamics of the system might not be relaxing and the typical energy landscape in which steady states are identified with minima of a lyapunov function so that the dynamical process executes a march which terminates at the bottom of one of the valleys could not be applicable .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of other areas at the borderline of statistical mechanics like neural networks @xcite where sometimes is not possible to build up a lyapunov function which the dynamics tend to minimize .",
    "in fact , as we will see below there are strong analogies of the model considered here with that area of research .",
    "the model i consider here is called the minority game ( mg ) @xcite which is the mathematical formulation of `` el farol bar '' problem considered by brian arthur @xcite . the idea behind",
    "this problem is the study of how many individuals may reach a collective solution to a problem under adaptation of each one s expectations about the future . as the models mentioned before",
    ", the mg is a dynamical system of many interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the mg includes two new features which make it different : the first one is the minority rule , which makes a complete steady state in the community impossible .",
    "thus , dust is never settled since individuals keep changing and adapting in quest of a non - existing equilibrium .",
    "the second ingredient is that the collectivity of individuals is heterogeneous , since individuals have different ways to tackle available information about the game and convert it into expectations about future .",
    "effectively , the minority rule and heterogeneity translate into mean - field interaction , frustration and quenched disorder in the model , ideas which are somehow familiar to disordered systems in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "actually , the mg is related to those systems and some of the techniques of disordered systems can be applied to understand its behavior .    at this point ,",
    "i hope the reader is convinced that the mg is an interesting problem from the statistical mechanics point of view : is a complex dynamical disordered system which can be understood with techniques from statistical physics .",
    "in fact , most of the research about the mg problem has been done inside the physics community . however , the el farol bar problem originates in the economic literature , although it represents a fierce assault on the conventions of standard economics . in this sense",

    "the type of rationality which is usually assumed in economics perfect , logical , deductive rationality  is extremely useful in generating solutions to theoretical problems @xcite , but if fails to account for situations in which our rationality is bounded ( because agents can not cope with the complexity of the situation ) or when ignorance about other agents ability and willingness to apply perfect rationally lead to subjective beliefs about the situation . even in those situations ,",
    "agents are not completely irrational : they adjust their behavior based on the what they think other agents are going to do , and these expectations are generated endogenously by information about what other agents have done in the past . on the basis of these expectations , the agent takes an action , which in turn becomes a precedent that influences the behavior of future agents .",
    "this creates a feedback loop of the following type :    [ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]     note that the phase transition is both explained in terms of the information which is available to the agents and the minimization of the total waste , while only @xmath1 is an order parameter .",
    "other quantities have been identified as order parameters to explain the phase transition found numerically at @xmath2 .",

    "as we see in figure [ fig - information ] @xmath3 is zero in the @xmath5 phase which means that all the agents change their strategy at least once .",
    "this is also the case for large values of @xmath6 , since agents behave more or less randomly .",

    "the phase transition can be understood as an `` unbinding '' transition , since for @xmath7 strategy points @xmath8 remain very close to each other and then agents can switch easily from one strategy to the other . however , for @xmath9 one of each agent s strategies wins in the long run and its virtual score @xmath8 is much larger than the others .",
    "finally , while there is no significant finite size corrections to the order parameter @xmath1 , the fraction of frozen agents @xmath3 seems to drop discontinuously to zero at @xmath10 when the number of agents is changed . despite both order parameters indicate that the system undergoes a phase transition at @xmath11 it is not yet clear which is the nature of the phase transition ( first , second order ? ) and whether it is an equilibrium or non - equilibrium phase transition .",

    "the universality of the behavior found in the last section for different number of agents , strategies or memory , suggests that it should depend on a generic feature of the game . due to the minority rule",
    ", agents tend to differentiate : if they use the same strategy then all of them will lose . thus , somehow the minority rule forces the agents to choose that strategy among theirs that makes them singular in the community",
    "this translates into a repulsion of agents chosen strategy inside the strategy space .",
    "but the set of available strategies only contains @xmath12 strategies .",
    "thus one should expect that agents are very different between them if the number of strategies is bigger than @xmath13 , while they should behave more like a crowd if their strategy heterogeneity is small .",
    "in other words we should observe a change in the system behavior when @xmath14 .",
    "however as we saw in the last section this change of behavior is observed at @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath16 .",

    "if agents tend to differentiate they can only do it by choosing those completely different strategies and this is only possible if @xmath18 . for @xmath19 groups of agents with the same set of similar strategies",
    "those agents end up using their same best strategy and become a _ crowd _ , since they react to the available information in the same way .",
    "the different behavior of @xmath20 can be understood in terms of this crowds @xcite :    * when @xmath18 , agents carry a considerable fraction of all possible strategies .",
    "this means that for a large fraction of agents their best strategy @xmath21 is the same at time @xmath22 .",
    "then the size of this crowd is of the order of @xmath23 , which means that the variance is of order @xmath24 .",
    "* on the other hand , when @xmath25 the crowds will be low populated since the @xmath21 are almost different for any agent due to the high heterogeneity , which makes agents act independently .",

    "more quantitative approximations to the size of the crowds and anticrowds are possible which reproduce the observed volatility behavior @xcite . another way to characterize",
    "the formation of crowds and/or anticrowds is to measure the distance between the best strategies of all the agents @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hamming distance ( 1-norm ) in the @xmath17-dimensional space of the strategies .",
    "as seen in figure [ distancia ] , agents tend to differentiate between them and thus maximizing the distances between their best strategies .",
    "however , this is not possible for small values of @xmath6 , since then agents are force by their limited memory to share their strategies .",
    "the situation is better for large @xmath6 , since agents set of strategies do not overlap and then the distance between them is random @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , for moderate values of @xmath6 differentiation makes the system of agents to organize in groups with completely different best strategies . in the case the crowds and anticrowds are of size @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , and knowing that the distance between two completely different strategies is @xmath17 we get @xmath34 $ ] which is bigger than the random case .    in summary ,",
    "the observed behavior in the mg is the result of the minority rule in the strategy space : the minority rule imposes a repulsion of agents chosen strategies at each time . however , the volume of the strategy space is fixed by @xmath35 and thus repulsion is only effective when the dimension @xmath17 is much bigger than the number of strategies present in the game .",

    "one of the main characteristics of the mg model is that agents adapt and learn from their past history to achieve a better personal record . as we saw in the previous section ,",
    "the memory of the agents is crucial , because it determines the strategy space dimension and also because the memory is associated with the ability of agents to spot patterns in the available information so they can coordinate better .",
    "somehow , the sequence of the winning groups contains information about the strategies of all the agents and having more memory gives an agent the possibility to exploit this information .",
    "for example , for a fixed number of agents @xmath13 , increasing their memory @xmath35 could lead to better coordination and higher individual success . in the limit @xmath36",
    "however , more memory implies increasing complexity and random behavior .       since information is fed back into the system , early studies of the mg concentrated in the possibility that the system of @xmath13 agents could exploit this information to achieve better coordination .",
    "however , a.  cavagna in @xcite showed by means of extensive simulations that if the information @xmath37 which is given to the agents at each time step is chosen randomly and independently of time from its possible values @xmath38 the behavior of the mg remains the same regarding time averaged extensive quantities like the volatility , the information @xmath1 or @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ figcartoon1 ] ) .",
    "the crucial point is that every agent reacts to the same piece of information whether this information is endogenous or exogenous , false or true . as a consequence",
    ", there is no room in this model for any kind of forecasting of the future based on the understanding of the past : coordination in the mg does not come through exploitation of available information in the sequence of the winning groups .",
    "leaving aside the fact that changing the real sequence of @xmath37 for random numbers gives the same quantitative behavior for different quantities , this finding has significant importance for the theoretical understanding of the mg model . specifically , equation ( [ eq_information ] )",
    "drops from the definition of the model which is simply given by equations ( [ eq_points ] ) and ( [ eq_action ] ) together with the ranking of each agent s strategies at any time step . in this sense , this results are useful in the theoretical understanding of the mg model , since it shows that the complicated feedback of the endogenous information in the system is just an irrelevant complication and thus , can be dropped in the way to explain the rich structure of this adaptative model .",
    "this fact does not mean that the memory parameter @xmath35 is not relevant in the model : indeed , the model displays a phase transition at a given value of @xmath35 for a fixed number of agents .",
    "however , from the results of a.  cavagna in @xcite it is reasonable to conclude that the parameter @xmath35 only relates to the dimension @xmath39 of the strategies space . indeed , as we have just shown in section [ section_spanning ] , the description of the phase transition observed in the mg can be just based on geometrical considerations about the distribution of strategies in the space of strategies .    as we can see in figure [ figcartoon1 ] the order parameter @xmath1 does not change substantially when exogenous information is considered instead of endogenous one .",
    "but , as we said in section [ sec_adaptation ] , @xmath1 is related to correlations in the sequence of winning groups .",
    "since the sequence of the winning groups is exogenous and random we expect in @xmath40 for all values of @xmath6 . the fact that this is not true is due to the twofold role that @xmath1 plays in the original mg :",
    "@xmath1 is the response of the system to a given piece of information and does not depend on the origin of the information . but ( see figure [ figcartoon1 ] ) :    * when endogenous information is considered , the response of the system to the available information does show up in the sequence of winning groups . *",
    "when exogenous information is considered , the response of the system is only considered to get the winning group and to keep record of the performance of the strategies and is not included in the sequence of the winning group .    in either case ,",
    "@xmath41 means that for a given piece of information , there is a possibility for agents to predict the response of the system . in this sense , memory is not irrelevant in the mg ( see the discussion about this in @xcite ) .",
    "despite the fact that the phase transition and macroscopic properties of the mg are the same with exogenous information , some properties of the mg are lost . as we show in figure [ fig_simulations ] the attendance and the size of the minority groups",
    "are correlated in time and display time periodic patterns for @xmath5 .",
    "this is lost when the information agents react to is exogenous as seen in figure [ fig_exogenous ] , although the typical size of the minority groups is the same and then @xmath20 is independent on the nature of the information used .",
    "thus , any extension of the mg game which depends on the periodic nature of the bar attendance should give different results when exogenous information is considered @xcite .",
    "the fact that the memory parameter @xmath35 is only relevant to determine the dimension of the strategies space led to the generalization of equation ( [ eq_points ] ) to consider general @xmath42-dimensional strategies and vectors @xmath43 for any value of @xmath42 and not only for those with @xmath44 , which is only an unnecessary complication @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec_adaptation ] we saw that agents adapt to achieve a personal better solution to the mg problem which in turn makes the total waste smaller than the random solution for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , although agents are selfish and tend to place themselves into the minority group irrespectively of other agent s action , their dynamics tend to maximize the global efficiency , that is , to maximize the bar attendance .",
    "the concept that the system is trying to minimize a given quantity is very appealing to statistical mechanics .",
    "if this quantity exists , the system can be studied by considering its minima and perturbations around them .",
    "however , due to the minority rule , the mg never settles down : specifically , some of the agents keep on changing their strategies forever and nor @xmath21 , neither @xmath8 come to a rest , which is never equal to one . ] .",
    "thus , there can not be any quantity based on these degrees of freedom that the mg dynamics tend to minimize .",
    "however , since the actions of the agents @xmath46 depend on the points of the strategies and @xmath8 depend on the past history of actions , one can wonder whether there is any time pattern in the long run that agents follow . specifically , it might be that @xmath46 never come to a rest , but @xmath47 can converge when @xmath48 to a given quantity if agent @xmath49 does follow any behavioral pattern .",
    "for example , agent @xmath49 can be within the fraction @xmath3 of people who always chooses one of his strategies and then @xmath50 is the average of the possible outcomes of that strategy for all possible realizations of the information .",
    "this is the key point in the first attempt at solution of the mg model found in @xcite , which we outline in this section .",
    "first of all , let us rewrite the equations of the mg at this stage .",
    "since the observed behavior of the mg is independent of @xmath51 we chose the minimal case @xmath52 . then introducing @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath54 is the difference of points between agent @xmath49 two strategies , equation ( [ eq_points ] ) reads @xmath55\\ ] ] and @xmath56 \\cdot \\vec{i}(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . with this notation , @xmath59 .",
    "another unnecessary complication is the binary payoff function @xmath60 for the strategies .",

    "thus , in the limit @xmath63 and @xmath64 and making a temporal coarse - graining over time steps @xmath65 that contain infinite number of updatings like ( [ eq_points1 ] ) , the right hand side of ( [ eq_points1 ] ) can be replace by its mean value over time @xcite : @xmath66\\bigg\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and we have neglected fluctuations in favor of mean values according to the law of large numbers .",
    "finally , making the approximation that the points at time @xmath22 are related to @xmath50 through the soft condition @xmath68 $ ] ( where @xmath69 is a constant ) we obtain the following dynamical equation in the continuum approximation @xmath70 @xmath71.\\ ] ] this can be easily written as a gradient descent dynamics @xmath72 where @xmath73 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigg[\\sum_{i=1 } ( \\vec{\\omega}_i + \\vec{\\xi}_i m_i)\\bigg]^2.\\ ] ] note that @xmath74 is a positive function of @xmath75 and then @xmath74 is a lyapunov function of the dynamics given by ( [ lyapunov1 ] ) . making the same type of temporal coarse - graining we get @xmath76",
    "this equations implies that the dynamics of the agents tends to minimize @xmath74 instead of @xmath77 and thus the properties of the mg are described by the ground states of @xmath74 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath78 is related to the order parameter @xmath1 at least when @xmath1 is very small , i.e. close to the phase transition .",

    "ground state properties of @xmath78 can be analyzed using standard tools from statistical mechanics of disordered systems .",
    "averages over different realizations of the disorder @xmath81 and @xmath82 are obtained through the replica trick @xcite . despite the approximations made to get to equations ( [ lyapunov1 ] ) and ( [ lyapunov2 ] )",

    "for @xmath88 however , the solution given by exploring the ground state of @xmath74 has some mathematical problems and fails to reproduce the observed behavior .",
    "the fact that the game for @xmath9 is described by the minimization of @xmath74 shed some light also about the real nature of the mg : first of all , the dynamics tend to minimize a lyapunov function which depends on the history of agents decisions instead of agents instantaneous decisions . and second , the function which agents tend to minimize has some disorder which is encoded in the `` quenched '' patterns @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this last feature of the mg resembles the dynamics of attractor neural networks ( ann ) @xcite where @xmath42 patterns are stored through the hebbian learning rule and the recurrent network retrieve the information stored in the neurons .",
    "the control parameter @xmath89 measures then the ratio between the number of stored patterns @xmath42 and the number of neurons @xmath13 . in general , information retrieval in ann is possible only under some conditions about the dynamics and @xmath6 .",
    "this comparison is very appealing , since in principle agents in the mg would like to retrieve time patterns or other agents strategies to achieve a better personal record .",
    "thus , is mg just an ann of neurons trying to retrieve other agents strategies",
    "? we will complete this analogy in the following sections .",
    "the irrelevance of the information contained in the sequence of the winning groups found in section [ sec_information ] poses a new question : how can it be that changing the model from being a closed system with endogenous information to an open one with exogenous information does not change its aggregate behavior ? as we saw",
    ", the reason for that is that the aggregate behavior of the mg is encoded in the response of the system to the input information .",
    "averaging this response over all possible values of the information will give us the mean response of the system and then we can update all strategies points concurrently .",
    "for example , we found in section [ sec_maximizing ] that coarse - graining the dynamics of the mg over many time steps leads to a coupled set of equations for @xmath8 in which the information @xmath43 is averaged out .",
    "the information is then simply a go - between quantity that connects agents strategies dynamics and in principle it is disposable .    in order to get the averaged dynamics of the strategies for all possible values of @xmath6 and not just for @xmath9 as in the previous section ,",
    "several techniques were used @xcite . here",
    "we outline one of them , which is by means of the kramers - moyal expansion @xcite .",
    "this is a general technique to obtain diffusion approximations of stochastic processes .",
    "specifically , equations ( [ eq_action2 ] ) define an stochastic process than can be approximated by a drift together with a diffusion in the space of strategies points . in this case , due to the fact that the random process @xmath43 appears twice in equation ( [ eq_action2 ] ) ,",
    "only the drift term remains non - zero in the kramers - moyal approximation which yields @xmath90 comparing equation ( [ eq_action3 ] ) with ( [ eq_action2 ] ) we observe that information has been averaged out in favor of an effective coupling between agents strategies , as we expected .",
    "thus , rather than allowing the strategy payoff valuations to be changed at each round , only the accumulated effect on a large number of market decisions is used to change an agent s strategy payoff valuations .",

    "this kind of time delayed ann were considered as possible candidates of models for storing and generating time sequences of patterns @xcite . in the mg , the time delayed dynamics is not set up to retrieve or create any particular time pattern but rather comes from the inductive reasoning process , which keeps record of the performance of the strategies along the game .",
    "thus , equations ( [ mgann1 ] ) define a new type of ann whose main ingredients are :    * @xmath42 heterogenous patterns are stored through the anti - hebbian rule ( [ hebbian ] ) due to the minority rule , * each neuron reacts to an external field given by @xmath107 , and * dynamics is time delayed over the last @xmath110 steps because of the adaptation process ,    which are necessary to reproduced the observed behavior of the mg .",
    "finally one may ask whether is it relevant to keep the whole historic performance of each strategy , i.e. , @xmath111 or just the last @xmath112 time steps are just the points of strategy @xmath6 of agent @xmath49 for the last @xmath110 time steps . ] . in figure [ fig - mm ]",

    "actually the cases @xmath113 reproduces quite accurately the high volatility region @xmath114 which means that in this phase , agents react only to the last winning group . for @xmath115 keeping the record of strategies over large time periods @xmath116 is the only way for the agents to achieve a better - than - random solution to the problem .",
    "finally , it is appealing to rewrite equations ( [ mgann ] ) like a learning process @xcite .",
    "after all , inductive reasoning in the mg is the way agents learn how to act in the game .",
    "if the time dependence in ( [ mgann1 ] ) is considered as a learning process or training of a set of @xmath13 interacting perceptrons , then the learning process is given by @xmath117 \\label{task } \\\\",
    "\\tilde j_{ij } ( t)&=&\\frac{t}{t+1}\\tilde j_{ij } \\sigma_j(t+1 ) \\sigma_j(t)+ \\frac{1}{t+1}j_{ij } \\label{learning}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this type of interacting @xmath13 perceptrons ( one for each agent ) have been considered recently in the context of the mg @xcite , although with a different learning rule for the perceptrons and with homogeneous agents ( i.e. @xmath118 ) . however , as we can see in ( [ learning ] ) , the mg has its unique learning process which comes through adaptation of agents along iteration of the game .    in summary , after clearing up the mg model we ended up with a set of heterogenous agents ( or perceptrons ) which are learning through the adaptation process ( [ learning ] ) the minority task given by ( [ task ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the training of @xmath13 perceptrons given by ( [ learning ] ) and to consider the general problem of learning in a set of interacting @xmath13 perceptrons under the basic mg features : heterogeneity , minority rule and time delayed interactions .",
    "the success of the solution obtained using the replica trick @xcite and outlined in section [ sec_maximizing ] , established the concept that inductive reasoning of @xmath13 interacting agents in the mg is described by the minimization of a global function , the response @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the mg seems to be similar to an equilibrium problem of disordered systems . but",
    "a simple numerical experiment shows that this is not the case @xcite : suppose that agents are confident about one of their strategies and they start by giving it a period of grace , i.e. an initial number of points different from zero .",
    "this means that @xmath119 for some @xmath6 in equation ( [ eq_points ] ) .",
    "simulations in figure [ inicond ] show that this tiny modification of the mg model has a profound impact in the results for @xmath85 .",
    "specifically , the high volatility region is lost and a region in which volatility is very small emerges . moreover ,",
    "the steady state volatility for @xmath88 depends on the initial condition @xmath120 @xcite , experiments in which the number of agents @xmath13 or the memory @xmath42 are changed quasi - statically lead to hysteresis behavior in the mg @xcite , again demonstrating the non - equilibrium behavior in the region @xmath5 ] .",
    "the fact that the steady state reached by agents through adaptation depends on the initial condition for @xmath122 means that this region is non - ergodic and that the observed change of behavior at @xmath2 is due to a non - equilibrium phase transition instead of an equilibrium transition .",
    "a precise mathematical description of this was reached through the generating functional methods of de dominicis @xcite by a.  c.  c.  coolen and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this technique allows to carry out the average over the quenched disorder in the system into the dynamical equations directly , instead of performing it in the equilibrium partition function .",
    "the outcome of this averaging is a set of closed equations for the correlation @xmath123 and response @xmath124 functions of the variables involved in the dynamical equations [ @xmath125 and @xmath96 ] at different times .",
    "this system of dynamical equations for @xmath123 and @xmath124 is difficult to solve in general , but some analytical progress can be made if one looks at two particular situations :    * for instance , one can investigate asymptotic stationary solutions , i.e. when @xmath127 and @xmath128 . and assume that the system has not anomalous response , i.e. that fluctuations around the stationary state are damped in finite time and the susceptibility is finite . in this case , the results obtained in section [ sec_maximizing ] through the evaluation of the minima of @xmath74 are recovered .",
    "moreover , this stationary solution predicts self - consistently when it breaks down : the susceptibility of the solution diverges at @xmath2 and the assumption of stationary in the solution is only valid for @xmath9 . * for @xmath85 one can investigate the first time steps of the correlation and response function dynamics .",
    "it is found that the volatility depends strongly on the initial conditions : for @xmath52 and depending on @xmath129 a transition from high volatility @xmath130 to low volatility @xmath131 is found ( see fig .",
    "[ inicond ] ) .",
    "these results point out that the phase transition found in the mg is a non - equilibrium transition and that only for @xmath132 the adaptation dynamics is relaxing and ergodic : for any initial condition a final unique steady state is reached which is described by the minima of @xmath74 . for @xmath85",
    "the system is non - ergodic , since the system asymptotic behavior depends strongly on the initial conditions .",
    "after all , the mg is posed without requiring detailed balance or any kind of fluctuation - dissipation theorem about its dynamics , so there is in principle no reason to expect that the mg should have the usual relaxing and ergodic dynamics of other models in statistical mechanics .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note @xcite than ergodicity in the mg is not broken at the macroscopic level as in replica symmetry breaking solutions in spin - glass ; it is done at the microscopic level since the dynamical rules do not fulfill any type of detailed balance .    the generating functional analysis proved to be the right tool to study the mg since its focus is on the dynamics of disordered systems , specially on spin glasses .",
    "since the existence of a partition function is not needed , complicated cases like steady states with non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relationships or violations of detailed balance can be tackled within this formalism . indeed",
    ", the mg model features do not root in physical considerations so there is no reason _ a priori _ to expect detailed balance or fluctuation - dissipation relationships .",
    "the land of statistical physics is broad , with many dales , hills , valleys and peaks to explore that are of relevance to the real world and to our ways of thinking about it . + _",
    "michael e.  fisher in rev .",
    "phys . * 70 * , 653 ( 1998)_.    through this journey we have learned that adaptation or inductive reasoning as that of the mg model leads to a system of many interacting and heterogeneous degrees of freedom whose dynamics is not local in time .",
    "the system may or may not be ergodic and , generally speaking , equilibrium statistical mechanics should be abandoned .",
    "however there are some similarities with statistical mechanics of disordered systems and some of the tools and concepts of disordered system do apply to the mg .",
    "the mg is just a model of adaptation of @xmath13 agents which can be generalized to other types of learning as we saw in section [ sec_news ] . for those types of dynamical problems ,",
    "the suitable tool from statistical physics is the generating functional approach we mentioned in section [ sec_dynamics ] which gives not only information about the properties of the system when a steady state is reached , but also about the dynamical nature of the phase transition .",
    "in fact , the generating function approach is also useful in different modifications of the mg @xcite .",
    "adaptation turned out to be a good way to solve the mg problem for @xmath9 .",
    "but it might not be the best way to do it in the region @xmath85 . as a matter of fact",
    ", simple modifications of the original mg model like taking a non - zero initial condition or what is called the thermal minority game @xcite , in which agent s decisions are taken with some degree of stochasticity ( instead of using their best one always ) , lead to better solutions ( @xmath133 ) of the mg problem than the original model .    however , part of the success of the application of analytical techniques in the mg is due to its fixed rules .",
    "for example , in real life we do not expect to come across a game in which players have the same space of strategies , or in which the initial condition for all of them is that in which none of their strategies is preferred .",
    "relaxing some of these rules in the mg does not modify its behavior ; unfortunately , others do . during the last years",
    "we have witnessed a burst of spin - off models whose core is given by the mg @xcite . of particular importance",
    "are those in which refinements of the model were towards the description of real markets @xcite or real problems in ecology @xcite .",
    "the validity of the mg as a behavioral model of agents trying to spot patterns in aggregate outcomes has been even tested through experiments with people @xcite showing that indeed people tend to coordinate despite its selfish nature in the game .    on the other hand ,",
    "there has been some extensions of the mg which has been used in the context of time series analysis and prediction by doing _",
    "reverse engineering _ :",
    "since the mg is , as we saw in section [ sec_news ] , a precise learning rule , why not training a set of @xmath13 agents with a real life time series ? in that case , agents strategies are not fixed at the beginning of the game but rather , they are chosen to reproduced the given time series .",
    "this has been applied to financial times series in order to forecast future price movements @xcite .",
    "the virtue of the mg relies on the incorporation of the minority rule and agents heterogeneity in the model as well as an agent - based approach to the solution of a given problem . in this regard , during the last years there has been a lot of attention in the solution of general problems using multi - agent models @xcite .",
    "in fact coupled layers of perceptrons are just a simple example of this approach @xcite .",
    "the general principles of those multi - agent systems is that agents individually have incomplete information or capabilities for solving the problem but can reach a solution by interacting among them .",
    "the success of understanding of the mg using tools from statistical mechanics encourages to tackle more general heterogeneous multi - agent systems problems within the theory of disordered systems in condensed matter .",
