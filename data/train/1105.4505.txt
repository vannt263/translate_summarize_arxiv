    "the survival of such systems seems to depend on both the protection provided by a shielding envelope of warm , ionized gas @xcite , and on environment i.e. , they are found in locations removed from the immediate vicinity of dense coronal gas . for halo masses below @xmath19 m@xmath2 ,",

    "this measurement is the primary motivation for _ the survey of hi in extremely low - mass dwarfs _ ( shield ) .",
    "we now describe the strategy , goals , and present status of shield .",
    "our investigation began with a series of concept demonstration observations of 6 low - mass systems detected in early alfalfa observations ( see `` concept demonstration targets '' in table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "these systems were observed with the _ very large array _ ( vla ) for programs ac963 ( pi cannon ) and as883 ( pi saintonge ) during the vla@xmath26evla transition .",
    "the data reduction and imaging were performed wtih the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) ; reductions proceeded normally , with modifications as necessary for aliased baselines .",
    "the calibrated datasets were imaged to the rms level using both natural ( robust=5 ) and robust ( robust=0.5 ) weighting , and then smoothed to a common circular beam size of 20 .",
    "the two approaches resulted in flux integrals that differed by 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex10% for most systems , and we thus show only the robust weighted images in this work .",

    "3-color images of the six precursor galaxies .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the high surface brightness stellar populations are dominated by blue stars .",
    "this is confirmed by the _ sdss _",
    "photometry presented in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the weighted mean ( u@xmath13r ) color for the six precursor systems is ( u@xmath13r ) @xmath27 0.99@xmath140.02 .",
    "this can be compared with ( u@xmath13r)@xmath171.3 , the mean sdss color for all alfalfa galaxies with log(m@xmath11)@xmath107.7 ( huang etal .",

    "figure  [ figcap1 ] compares the stellar and neutral gas distributions ; overlaid on each panel are hi column density contours at the ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4)@xmath810@xmath28 @xmath4 levels .",
    "the neutral gas distributions are centrally concentrated and spatially coincident with the blue stellar populations .",
    "all systems show peak column densities below the canonical sf surface density threshold of n@xmath29 10@xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite . while the spectral resolution of these images are sufficient to resolve the hi profiles derived from alfalfa , the hi distributions are only slightly larger than the synthesized beam size ( 20 ) .",
    "although these six systems have hi masses above 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 ( see table  [ t1 ] ) , these precursor observations nonetheless demonstrate the scientific potential of a coordinated observing campaign using the evla ( see perley etal .",
    "2011 for a description of the evla project ) to explore the low - mass galaxies detected by alfalfa .",
    "we thus initiated shield ( osro program 10b-187 , pi cannon ; time allocation of 180 hours ) , a multi - configuration study of the neutral ism of 12 extremely low - mass systems .",
    "the sample members were selected from the @xmath3011,000 alfalfa - detected galaxies to date on the basis of hi mass ( m@xmath11 @xmath311.6@xmath810@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) and line width ( full width at 50% of peak @xmath10 65 kms@xmath6 from alfalfa ) ; the latter discriminates against massive but hi - poor galaxies and identifies the truly low mass galaxies .",
    "the median distance , hi mass , and hi line width are 5.7 mpc , 4.7@xmath810@xmath0 m@xmath2 , and 25 kms@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "our observational strategy ( 9 , 4 , 2 hours per source in the b , c , d arrays , respectively , with typical calibration overheads of 25% ) achieves high spatial ( @xmath216  synthesized beam at full resolution ) and spectral resolution ( @xmath210.82 kms@xmath6ch@xmath6 ) , while retaining sensitivity to extended structure . when data acquisition is complete , the 5@xmath32 ( per channel ) column density sensitivity will be n@xmath11 @xmath3010@xmath33 @xmath4 and @xmath302.3@xmath810@xmath28 @xmath4 at low and high spatial resolution , respectively ; the realized column density sensitivities will be higher because the linewidths are larger than the channel spacing ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",

    "the fall images ( see table  [ t1 ] ) were obtained during superior observing conditions ( @xmath210.4  fwhm seeing ) ; the spring images ( see table  [ t1 ] ) were obtained during average observing conditions ( 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex1  fwhm seeing ) .",
    "broadband johnson - cousins ( b , v , r ) filters , and a narrowband h@xmath5 filter , were used .",
    "standard reduction strategies were applied .",
    "the images are first cosmic ray rejected , aligned and combined .",
    "the broad and narrowband images are then smoothed to a common point spread function size and flux scaled to remove the continuum from the narrowband image .",
    "finally , standard photometry routines are applied , using observations of photometric standard stars acquired during the same observing session .",
    "we estimate the photometric accuracies of the fall and spring images to be better than 2% and 4% , respectively .",
    "table  [ t1 ] compiles the absolute b magnitudes and ( b@xmath13v ) colors of 11 of the 12 shield galaxies ; an absolute calibration of the images of agc174585 ( which is outside the sdss footprint ) was not attained .",
    "similar to the precursor systems shown in figure  [ figcap1 ] , the optical appearances of the 12 galaxies shown in figures  [ figcap2 ] , [ figcap3 ] and [ figcap4 ] are each dominated by blue stars ( note that only the r - band image of agc 174585 is shown , due to two of the images being affected by cloud cover ) .",
    "the weighted mean ( b@xmath13v ) color is 0.43@xmath140.01 ; this compares well with the typical ( b@xmath13v ) @xmath270.42@xmath140.05 found for local star - forming dirr galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , the weighted mean ( u@xmath13r ) color for the shield galaxies is 1.25@xmath140.02 ; these systems are on average slightly redder than the precursor objects , though still consistent with the results of huang etal .",
    "( in preparation ) .    shield is a systematic investigation of a sample of galaxies with hi masses below 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 outside the local group . using our evla datasets",
    ", we are focusing on three primary goals .",
    "first , what properties change between mini - halos ( hi clouds without optical counterparts ; see giovanelli etal .",
    "2010 ) , very low - mass dwarfs , and more massive systems ?",
    "are the cosmologically important galaxies with hi masses of 10@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 systematically different than more or less massive objects ?",
    "we plan to identify correlations between fundamental galaxy parameters ( e.g. , hi line width , stellar mass , sf rate , etc . ) by undertaking a comparative study of these properties in objects that span some three orders of magnitude in dynamical mass , from @xmath2110@xmath010@xmath22 m@xmath2 ( i.e. , covering the mini - halo to dwarf galaxy transition region ) .",
    "the synthesis observations provided by the evla are crucial components of this program , as they allow us to examine both the global and the local processes that influence the evolution of these systems .",
    "second , what fraction of the mass in these low - mass dwarfs is baryonic ? when data acquisition is complete , our evla observing campaign will allow us to study the ism kinematics on spatial scales of order 200 pc in the galaxies in our sample ( assuming a 6  beam and a maximum distance of @xmath218 mpc ) .",
    "these data will allow us to extract detailed rotation curves in the inner regions of these galaxies and to infer the dark - to - baryonic fraction throughout the disks .",
    "equally important is the sensitivity of the combined evla@xmath34arecibo datasets to extended structure , which we will exploit to study gas in the outermost regions of the disks .",
    "third , is the character of the sf process different in very low - mass galaxies ?",
    "these systems have retained hi mass reservoirs of 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 over a hubble time ; they are apparently evolving in relative quiescence and are exceedingly inefficient at converting their interstellar gas into stars .",
    "these clues suggest that the sf law may in fact deviate significantly from the canonical schmidt - kennicutt prescription derived for more massive systems @xcite .",
    "while data acquisition for shield is ongoing , we are able to draw conclusions about various intriguing properties of these extremely low - mass galaxies using the c configuration images alone .",
    "we discuss three results in turn below .",
    "first , with only one exception ( agc111977 ) , the hi distributions of the shield galaxies are centrally concentrated at 20  resolution . in only one case ( agc110482 )",
    "does the observed hi column density reach the 10@xmath3 @xmath4 level ; however , we expect that higher - resolution imaging will localize regions of larger column densities ( see , e.g. , the discussion of beam smearing effects in begum etal .",
    "the shield galaxies appear to have gas surface densities comparable to those in other nearby galaxies with similar hi masses ( e.g. , all of the galaxies with m@xmath12 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 in begum etal .",
    "2008 have peak n@xmath35 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",
    "second , as discussed in detail by @xcite and roychowdhury etal .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) , the relationship between hi column density and ongoing sf in low - mass galaxies is complex .",
    "stochastic effects play an important role , and the overall process appears to be less efficient than in more massive galaxies . when taken at face value , the low integrated column densities of the shield galaxies are not conducive to ongoing sf . and yet , the stellar populations of these systems are dominated by blue stars ( as evidenced by the blue integrated colors in table  [ t1 ] ) , and the majority of the galaxies show active sf as traced by h@xmath5 emission ( see figures  [ figcap2 ] , [ figcap3 ] and [ figcap4 ] ) .",
    "our wiyn  3.5 m imaging produced usable h@xmath5 images of 11 systems ( images of agc 749241 were acquired but were compromised by cloud cover ) .",
    "10 of these systems show high surface brightness h@xmath5 emission ; the only conclusive h@xmath5 non - detection is agc 748778 . in most cases , h@xmath5 emission is located in close proximity to the highest hi column densities ( but see the diffuse h@xmath5 emission in the southern region of agc 111977 ) ; however , as noted above , none of these columns exceeds the canonical sf surface density threshold of 10@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "we note with interest that two of the six precursor systems ( agc 100062 and agc 101772 ) have strong h@xmath5 emission lines in their _ sdss _ spectra .",
    "finally , the full shield datasets will allow us to test our understanding of the dark matter contents of these low - mass galaxies and of @xmath20 within them .",
    "while detailed rotation curve analysis requires higher resolution b - configuration evla images , a few systems are already amenable to meaningful position - velocity analysis using the 20@xmath36 datacubes alone . using agc749237 as an example ( see the velocity field and position - velocity slice in figure  [ figcap4 ] )",
    ", we find solid - body rotation of 30 kms@xmath6 at a distance of @xmath2140@xmath36 from the dynamical center .",
    "we apply no inclination correction to this velocity ; we note , however , that the optical inclination _ i _",
    "@xmath1756 , and thus the true rotational velocity may be higher by @xmath2120% or more . at the adopted ( but uncertain ) distance of 3.2 mpc",
    ", this implies a dynamical mass m@xmath37 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex @xmath211@xmath810@xmath9 m@xmath2 .",
    "correcting for helium and molecular gas ( 35% of m@xmath11 ) and assuming equal masses of stars and gas , this implies @xmath20 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex0.1 .",
    "as expected , this low - mass galaxy follows the trends of @xmath20 at low dynamical masses in the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have introduced shield , a systematic investigation of a sample of galaxies with hi masses below 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 outside the local group .",
