    "many phenomena which contain discernible events which can be counted can be ranked according to their frequency , and a so called zipf plot can be drawn .",
    "@xcite very often a @xmath6 linear relationship is found on a log - log plot .",
    "the slope corresponds to an exponent @xmath7 describing the frequency @xmath8 of the @xmath9 occurrence of the events according to their rank @xmath10 through , e.g. @xmath11 .",
    "such a ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 @xmath14 is found in many cases , with @xmath15 : see the distribution of @xmath16 of individuals or companies in countries ( pareto distribution ) @xcite , in economy with the @xmath17 of companies @xcite , in @xmath18 ( gutenberg - richter law ) @xcite , in @xmath19 distribution @xcite , etc . @xcite",
    "... the zipf law universal feature is thought to originate from stochastic processes @xcite , in particular when they can be modeled as random walks in a log scale @xcite , - though it is still often said in a lay language that the law is a description ( _ or a result ? _ ) of uniformity and diversity .",
    "a simple extension of the zipf analysis is to consider @xmath2-letter words , i.e. the words strictly made of @xmath2 characters without considering the white spaces",
    ". the available number of different letters or characters @xmath20 in the alphabet should also be specified .",
    "a power law for the word frequency @xmath21 is expected to be observed @xcite    @xmath22    the zipf exponent can be estimated through the derivative of the best linear fit on a log - log graph . there is no theory at this time predicting whether the exponent is a function of ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "elsewhere@xcite we had already shown that the zipf exponent could be different , call it @xmath0 if the frequency @xmath24 of occurrence is normalized with respect to the theoretical frequency @xmath25 which should be that expected for pure , or unbiased , ( stochastic ) brownian processes , thus    @xmath26    e.g. suppose a binary alphabet , i.e. made up of two characters , @xmath27 ( or 0 and 1 in electronics ) with occurrence @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; the theoretical frequency @xmath25 for the number @xmath30 of characters , say of the type @xmath31 in a word of length @xmath2 is @xmath32 .",
    "previous zipf - like analyses have often neglected the possibility that the ( @xmath27 ) distribution could be biased , over a finite size time interval , thus a finite tendency might exist , - and in fact could have a quite varied structure , as when in finance a trend is considered to be mimicked by some moving average @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that if a tendency is positive the number of positive volatility values is larger than the number of negative ones ( and conversely ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the zipf law exponent might be affected because of some bias in the ranking .",
    "whether or not the @xmath33 exponent depends on the bias is briefly examined here .",
    "the final goal of this series of investigations is to apply the idea in the study of financial temporal series , or generally translating a time series into a sentence , a particular letter corresponding to a particular variation of a signal .",
    "this is in line with previous studies in econophysics e.g. in order to search whether some investment strategy can be derived in particular from a zipf law observation .",
    "this would fall into the same type of studies as those implying the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) .",
    "@xcite    here we analyze time series based on a one dimensional fractional brownian motion @xcite characterized by the so called hurst exponent @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    why such a series ? because the fbm is not a markovian process since its value at a given time depends on all past points , whence we consider that it can be a useful model for modeling financial data time series .",
    "in fact , peters @xcite has shown that a fbm is a good model for describing",
    "_ returns _",
    "( but it does not work for @xmath34 ) in financial series .",
    "in order to develop a fbm we have used rambaldia and pinazza algorithm @xcite . according to the latter",
    "a fbm can be obtained from @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the `` walker '' position during a time interval @xmath37 ; @xmath36 is a random variable to be extracted from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a given variance .",
    "thereby the signal is a stochastic one , with a diffusion growing with time as @xmath38.@xcite the weight function @xmath39 is given by    @xmath40 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is such that @xmath42 . if @xmath43 one has the usual brownian motion .",
    "the signal is said to be persistent for @xmath44 , and antipersistent otherwise .",
    "there has been some conjecture @xcite , sometimes thought to be proven like a theorem that @xmath45    we have created six different fbm signals with @xmath3 values respectively equal to 0.17 , 0.41 , 0.47 , 0.60 , 0.67 , 0.82 .",
    "the series have a 16 384 ( = 2@xmath46 ) length .",
    "they are normalized such that    @xmath47    the coefficient 1.1 in the denominator and numerator is used in order to avoid zero and unity values .",
    "the series are shown in fig.1 .",
    "their characteristic is summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have recalculated the hurst exponent @xcite by the box counting method.@xcite the error bar is given in table 1 , as @xmath48 .",
    "the error bars are those resulting from a root mean square analysis .",
    "the linear trend has been measured and is reported to be of the order of @xmath49 , obviously due to the finite size of the system .    in order to apply the zipf method and extract the @xmath0 exponent relating the word frequency and its rank",
    ", we have translated the fbm signals into a text based on two @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath31 , occurring with a frequency @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the bias defined as @xmath52 has been measured .",
    "the bias and also the signal tendency have been observed as a function of time but are not shown here for lack of space .",
    "they decay quickly , can be positive or negative and are of the order or smaller than @xmath53 after 4000 time steps .",
    "the partial distribution functions ( pdf ) of the logarithm of the signal volatility , i.e. @xmath54 have been fitted to gauss and stretched exponential distributions . instead of ranking the @xmath55 values in constant size box histograms , one can as suggested by adamic @xcite use binned histograms with bin size increasing exponentially , thereby obtaining other _",
    "best fit parameters_. the stretched exponential distribution seems to well describe the signal fluctuations .",
    "a kolomogorov - smirnov test has also been made .",
    "@xcite notice that even though the ks distance increases when the exponential size box is used , this scheme reduces the uncertainty values and is found to lead to better fits .",
    "another test of the stochasticity ( or not ) of the data is based on the surrogate data method @xcite in which one randomizes either the sign of the fluctuations or shuffles their amplitude and fourier transform the resulting signal in order to observe whether a white noise signal is so obtained .",
    "finally we have observed whether the error bars ( or confidence intervals ) of the raw signal and the surrogate data signal ( not shown here ) overlap .",
    "the characteristic of the spectral functions @xmath56 so obtained are available from the authors if necessary .",
    "the results allow us to conclude that the above fbm signals are satisfactory for further treatment in presence of a to be pre - imposed bias .",
    "notice that similar histograms of such `` words '' were already published@xcite for ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) and ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) respectively , but the authors were more interested in deviations from randomness than in the zipf exponent .",
    "consider the ( @xmath2,2 ) zipf method , thus for an only two character alphabet , and words of arbitrary length @xmath2 .",
    "therefore there are @xmath61 different possible words .",
    "we searched whether these words exist in the series of fig.1 , counted them and ranked them in decreasing order , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , for @xmath62 . the @xmath0 ( and @xmath63 , also but not shown ) exponents seem to increase with @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "the result may be attributed to the finite size of the series , if one realizes that for such series the number of long words necessarily occurs more rarely than the number of short ones .    as a test of finite size effects",
    ", we have successively removed one by one the less frequently occurring words , and recalculated the @xmath0 ( and @xmath63 ) exponents , in some sense taking a _ rank _ @xmath64 zero limit , or first derivative .",
    "the exponents resulting from the average of the latter values are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that for large @xmath3 , i.e. a persistent signal , the exponents are rather constant , but still markedly vary for the antipersistent signals .    as a further step",
    ", we can also consider whether there is a zipf law @xmath65 , i.e. search for the @xmath0 exponent evolutions , as a function of time @xmath66 or as a function of the number of points in the series .",
    "we have calculated values of @xmath0 and @xmath63 for the ( first ) box containing 100 points , then for a box containing 200 , 300 , ... etc points up to 16 000 . the evolution ( fig .",
    "5 ) is rather drastic for the first , say , 6000 points but is moderately stable thereafter .",
    "next recall the so called local ( or better @xmath67 ) dfa method .",
    "@xcite in order to probe the existence of _ correlated and/or decorrelated sequences _ , a so - called observation box of finite size can be constructed , and is placed at the beginning of the data .",
    "a dfa is performed on the data contained in that box . the box is then moved along the historical time axis by a few points toward the right along the sequence . iterating this procedure for the sequence ,",
    "a `` local measurement '' of the `` degree of correlations '' is obtained , i.e. a local measure of the hurst exponent in the dfa case .",
    "the results indicate that the @xmath3 exponent value varies with time .",
    "this is similar in finance to what is observed along @xmath68 sequences@xcite in biology where the @xmath3 exponent drops below 1/2 in so - called non - coding regions .",
    "doing the same here , we obtain a @xmath69 zipf law and @xmath69 zipf exponent . to show a full list of figures or data as a function of @xmath2 @xmath70 [ 2,8 ] would generate a quite aversive stimulus in the reader , - therefore only the case @xmath2 = 5 is illustrated here .",
    "this value is so chosen within the financial idea background having motivated this study , i.e. @xmath71 is the ( true ) length of a week !",
    "results for the three fbm signals , with @xmath3 close to 0.5 , like in financial time series signals , are illustrated in figs .",
    "6 - 8 , considering windows ( boxes ) of size 250 , 500 and 1000 respectively moved along the signal .",
    "these values correspond to 1 , 2 and 4 year type investment window in finance .",
    "notice that the @xmath69 exponents are usually larger than the corresponding average one , in some sense corroborating the previous finite size effect analysis results . in turns it seems that the method is also of interest in order to observe short range correlation in fractional brownian motions , and non ergodic properties of finite size series .",
    "next consider a fbm on which a linear trend with amplitude @xmath72 is @xmath73 superposed ( and is equal to zero at the origin ) , i.e. we add @xmath74 to eq .",
    "we have taken values of @xmath72 ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 depending on the fbm considered .",
    "the case @xmath20=2 is only considered at this stage , again as a first step and having in mind scales used in other works in econophysics and electronics .",
    "the zipf plots are shown in fig.9 . for small",
    "@xmath3 a sharp drop is still seen at large @xmath10 values .",
    "the amplitude ( and trend ) effect is hardly noticed at small @xmath3 , even with a large trend , while the linearity ( on a log - log plot ) is interestingly observed for larger @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of the trend when @xmath2 is larger than 2 , thus up to @xmath2=8 , as in the preceding section is illustrated in fig .",
    "as should be expected the exponent @xmath0 is rather stable (= @xmath77 ) for a small trend ( or slope ) @xmath72 and small @xmath2 , but markedly increases when @xmath2 increases .",
    "the @xmath78 stability is observed apparently below some sort of crossover amplitude @xmath79 , ... depending on @xmath2 .",
    "the variation above such a crossover amplitude follows a power law ( @xmath80 ) which has been determined .",
    "the values of the exponent and of the power law variation on both sides of the @xmath81 are given in table 2 , with their error bar @xmath82 .",
    "we should point out that there seems to be some difference whether the fbm signal is persistent or not .",
    "for antipersistent signals , @xmath0 is quasi @xmath83 independent .",
    "the brownian motion is clearly an @xmath84 @xmath85 case .",
    "we have considered fractional brownian motions on which a linear trend is superimposed . we have translated the signals each into a text based of two letters @xmath51 and @xmath31 , ( or 0 and 1 bits ) according to the fluctuations in the corresponding random walk .",
    "we have studied the variation of the zipf exponent(s ) giving the relationship between the frequency of occurrence of words of length @xmath86 made of such  letters  for a binary alphabet .",
    "we have searched how the @xmath0 exponent of the zipf law is influenced by the trend and its amplitude .",
    "we can distinguish finite size effects , and results depending whether the starting fbm is persistent or not , depending on the hurst exponent .",
    "it seems that @xmath0 varies as a power law in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "this seems to be due to the fact that due to the trend a marked bias occurs in the relative fluctuations , thus in the word occurrences .",
    "it seems proven , even though it might have been expected so , that a persistent signal short range correlations as analyzed through the zipf method is more influenced by a trend than an antipersistent signal .    in the spirit of the local dfa",
    ", we have introduced considerations based on the effect of finite sizes of texts , and on the notion of a local ( or  time ",
    "dependent ) zipf law , in order to show their influence on the exponent values .    finally , coming back to the czirok et al .",
    "conjecture,@xcite it seems of interest to display the relationship for both studied classes of cases , i.e. ( i ) the raw fbm , and ( ii ) the fbm + linear trend .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "11 - 12 . even within considerations taking into account finite size effects and a poor man statistical analysis",
    ", it appears that such a law only holds near @xmath5 .",
    "other considerations are in order showing that many other cases can still be considered : first one could wonder more about signal stationarity effects .",
    "next , either a non linear ( thus like a power law or a moving average ) trend or a periodic background could be superposed on the raw signal .",
    "also multiplicative rather than additive trends could be used .",
    "this should be put in line with the remarkable studies of hu et al .",
    "@xcite on dfa but is a work an order of magnitude higher here because there are mk parameters to consider .",
