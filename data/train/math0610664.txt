    "dc - dc buck ( step down ) power converters serve to convert a direct current ( dc ) voltage level to a lower dc voltage level @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular types of power converters uses pulse width modulation ( pwm ) .",
    "a pulse width modulator produces a train of square pulses with a constant frequency and with a variable duration .",
    "by controlling the duration one can control the output voltage .",
    "last decade dc - dc pwm converters attracted much attention not only from engineers , but also from mathematicians and physicists .",
    "their study lies in the mainstream of common interest to discontinuous and hybrid dynamical systems .",
    "pwm converters may be described by nonlinear functional - differential equations , their operating modes correspond to periodic solutions .",
    "many publications were devoted to the existence of periodic or quasi - periodic solutions , to the analysis of local stability of such solutions , to bifurcations and ways of chaotization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of investigations do not concern global behavior of solutions , i.e. , a behavior for all possible initial conditions .",
    "there are two basic classes of mathematical models used for analysis and design of pwm power converters : discrete time models @xcite and models based on averaging in time of the modulator s output or of the state space vector @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the averaging technique suggests that the switching frequency is high when compared to the frequencies of continuous - time signals .",
    "in this paper we use another averaging approach , initiated by the work @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our approach is not asymptotical or approximate , unlike the other averaging technique .",
    "however , it gives conservative estimates if the switching frequency is not high enough .",
    "our method is based on ideas of the absolute stability theory @xcite and leads to a system of linear matrix inequalities ( lmi ) @xcite .",
    "this work is a natural extension of the lmi technique proposed in @xcite .",
    "some other methods for stability study of switched power converters via lmis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide a new computationally tractable procedure for stability investigations of pwm buck converters .",
    "it can be easily implemented with the help of a recently developed software for matlab and scilab modelling systems , such as lmilab @xcite , lmitool @xcite or sedumi solver @xcite interfaced with yalmip @xcite or _ cvx _ @xcite .",
    "the part of a converter without a control loop is called a power stage . a conventional power stage of a buck converter",
    "is shown in fig .  1 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath0 is an input voltage , @xmath1 is an on - off switch , @xmath2 is an inductance , @xmath3 is a capacitance and @xmath4 is a load resistance .",
    "let @xmath5 be a capacitor voltage ( which is the output voltage at the same time ) and @xmath6 be an inductor current .",
    "then we get @xmath7 when the switch is closed and @xmath8 when the switch is open .",
    "the switch is on with some constant switching period @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be an on - time of the switch , i.e. , a time when the switch is closed during the period .",
    "the value @xmath11 is called duty ratio .",
    "the above described power stage consists of three parts  a voltage source , a low - pass filter and a load .",
    "the low - pass filter is designed to remove higher harmonics and pass only a constant component of the output voltage . however , in fact the output voltage has a small ripple . neglecting this ripple ,",
    "one obtains @xmath12 so the input voltage steps down .",
    "in general , the power stage of a buck converter can be described with a system of equations @xmath13 with @xmath14 the signal @xmath15 is a train of square single - sign pulses of width @xmath10 and of period @xmath9 .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 is square , @xmath17 is a column and @xmath18 is a row .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 is hurwitz stable , i.e. , all its eigenvalues have negative real parts .",
    "e.g. , for equations ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) we have @xmath19 , \\qquad x_p= \\begin{bmatrix } i_l \\\\ u \\end{bmatrix}.\\ ] ]    equations ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) are the equations of an open loop system ( without a control feedback ) . in practice ,",
    "the pulse width @xmath10 is varied to control the output voltage @xmath5 .",
    "notice that equations ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) apply to so called continuous conduction mode , which suggests that the inductance @xmath2 is sufficiently large .      in dc",
    " dc converters a single sign modulation is commonly employed , i.e. a modulator s output takes only two values , 0 and 1 .    in this paper",
    "we will limit ourselves to a specific type of pulse - width modulation called natural or running modulation .",
    "the output of a modulator is @xmath20 an input signal @xmath21 is compared with a sawtooth oscillating signal ( a ramp ) @xmath22 here @xmath23 , @xmath24 are given positive parameters .",
    "a switching instant is determined from the relationship @xmath25 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "more accurately , the modulation law can be described as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 . if @xmath28 then @xmath29 . in all other cases",
    "@xmath30 is the smallest value @xmath31 $ ] to satisfy the equation @xmath32 all the other roots of equation ( [ 16 ] ) are ignored .    such type of modulation is sometimes called modulation with a latch . in this case",
    "every switching interval contains at most one pulse , so such unpleasant effect as chattering can not take place .",
    "besides the above scheme , where the trailing edge of a pulse is modulated , there are other modulation laws with modulation of the front edge or of both edges @xcite .      here",
    "we consider a buck converter with a voltage feedback control . in most cases",
    "a closed loop system with a voltage mode control can be described by the equations @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a constant square matrix , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are columns , @xmath37 is a row , and @xmath38 is a scalar .",
    "an operator @xmath39 describes a pulse modulator , so functions @xmath21 and @xmath15 are the input and the output of the modulator , respectively .",
    "suppose @xmath34 to be hurwitz stable , i.e. , all of its eigenvalues lie in the open left half - plane .",
    "in the simplest case the control signal is defined by the formula @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a constant reference signal and @xmath42 is a gain .",
    "combine ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) to obtain ( [ 17 ] ) with @xmath43    in a more general case two additional linear circuits are added to the control scheme , as shown in fig .  3 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let state space realizations of the compensator and of the sensor gain be @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , and @xmath46    combining ( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) one obtains ( [ 17 ] ) with @xmath47 c&=[-d_c d_s c_p , \\quad -d_cc_s,\\quad c_c ] , \\qquad \\psi = d_cv_{ref}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the help of the change of variables @xmath48 , equations ( [ 17 ] ) are transformed into the equations @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "operating modes of a converter correspond to periodical solutions of the closed loop system . as a rule ,",
    "such solution is either @xmath9-periodical , or has a period multiple to @xmath9 .",
    "the methods of finding periodical modes of a pwm system are well known . by straightforward calculations",
    ", one can obtain an explicit formula for the response of the linear part of a system to a square pulse signal .",
    "taking into account periodicity one comes to a system of transcendental equations with respect to a pulse duration , which can be solved by numerical methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    another way to find",
    "a periodical solution is to apply the harmonic balance method @xcite .",
    "certainly , in this case the linear part of the system needs to have good filtering properties .    in this work",
    "we will limit our considerations to @xmath9-periodical solutions , i.e. , to solutions whose period coincides with the switching period .",
    "in addition , we require these solutions to be _ unsaturated _ , i.e. , the cases @xmath51 or @xmath52 are excluded .    let us formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a @xmath9-periodical solution of ( [ 17a ] ) .",

    "however , if @xmath71 is fixed , we get an lmi in @xmath64 .",
    "so , ( [ 26 ] ) can be checked by varying @xmath71 in a loop .",
