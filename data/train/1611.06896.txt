    "derivations can be conveniently regarded as infinitesimal automorphisms of the vector bundle structure .",
    "so , in the realm of lie groupoids , it is natural to look at infinitesimal automorphisms of vb - groupoids and their infinitesimal counterparts , vb - algebroids .",
    "vb - groupoids are _ groupoid objects in the category of vector bundles _ or , equivalently , _ vector bundle objects in the category of lie groupoids _",

    "more generally , vb - groupoids can be seen as intrinsic models of two - terms representations up to homotopy of lie groupoids @xcite .",
    "for instance , the whole information about the _ adjoint representation _ ( _ up to homotopy _ ) of a lie groupoid @xcite is encoded in its tangent vb - groupoid .",
    "accordingly , deformations of a lie groupoid @xmath0 are controlled by the _ vb - groupoid complex _ of @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "additionally , the deformation complex of a lie groupoid @xmath0 and the deformation complex of its lie algebroid @xmath2 are intertwined by a van est map , which is yet another manifestation of the action of the _ lie functor _ @xcite .    for their importance in lie groupoid",
    "/ algebroid theory , it is natural to look at infinitesimal automorphisms of vb - groupoids and vb - algebroids and how does the lie functor intertwines them . notice that infinitesimal automorphisms of a lie groupoid are the same as _ multiplicative vector fields _ on it @xcite .",
    "similarly , infinitesimal automorphisms of a vb - groupoid are its _ multiplicative derivations_. multiplicative vector fields on lie groupoids are rather important objects . in particular ,",
    "their theory include the classical lifting of a vector field to its total lifts on the tangent and the cotangent bundle , which are of general interest in differential geometry @xcite .",
    "we expect multiplicative derivations to play a similar importance . in this respect , this paper is also part of the rather active research line aiming at studying _",
    "multiplicative structures _ on lie groupoids and their infinitesimal counterparts ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , i.e.  those geometric data which are compatible with the groupoid , resp .",
    "algebroid , structure .",
    "the study of multiplicative structures was originally motivated by poisson - lie groups @xcite and symplectic groupoids @xcite , and was pursued by several authors .",
    "recent research concentrated on multiplicative structures of tensorial type : multiplicative differential forms @xcite and multivectors @xcite , multiplicative ( 1,1 ) tensors @xcite , multiplicative generalized complex structures @xcite among the most general / important ones , with few exceptions : multiplicative foliations @xcite , multiplicative dirac structures @xcite , multiplicative vector - bundle valued differential forms @xcite .",
    "non - tensorial multiplicative structures ( other than the few examples listed above ) have not been considered yet . in particular , a systematic investigation ( including a definition ) of multiplicative ( multi)dos , multiplicative jets , and their infinitesimal counterparts , is still unavailable .",
    "there are at least two motivations to study multiplicative ( multi)dos and jets .",
    "one comes from jacobi geometry and is represented by jacobi - lie groups @xcite , a wide generalization of poisson - lie groups , and contact groupoids ( i.e.  lie groupoids equipped with a multiplicative contact structure @xcite ) .",
    "a jacobi structure on a manifold @xmath4 is a line bundle @xmath5 together with a lie bracket on its sections which is also a first order bido ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "jacobi structures encompass poisson , contact , and locally conformal symplectic structures as particular cases .",
    "one often studies the case when the line bundle @xmath5 is equipped with a global trivialization .",
    "e.g.  iglesias and marrero adopt this approach to their definition of a jacobi groupoid , i.e.  a lie groupoid with a compatible jacobi structure @xcite .",
    "however , probably , this is not the best choice from a conceptual point of view ( see also @xcite ) . not to mention that there are important jacobi structures whose underlying line bundle is not at all trivial .",
    "studying jacobi manifolds intrinsically does actually require the technology of derivations of vector bundles ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in order to define a jacobi groupoid intrinsically , one needs to understand multiplicative ( multi)derivations of vector bundles over lie groupoids first . here",
    ", we begin this program studying multiplicative derivations of a vb - groupoid .",
    "multiplicative multiderivations will be addressed in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "our second motivation comes from the geometric theory of pdes .",
    "geometrically , a pde is a submanifold in a jet space .",
    "symmetries provide important geometric invariants of a pde .",
    "symmetries of a pde form a lie pseudogroup and the latter can be seen as a lie subgroupoid of a jet groupoid .",
    "there are several natural ( multi)dos and jets attached to a jet space , in particular a jet groupoid @xcite . in the last case , it is likely that , when natural , a do / jet is also multiplicative , in a suitable sense , thus falling in the class our program aims to define and study .",
    "additionally , zero loci of multiplicative dos will provide an important class of pdes on sections of vector bundles over lie groupoids .    the paper is divided into three main sections .",
