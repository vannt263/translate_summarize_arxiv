    "the different values of a@xmath6 have led to a suggestion of clumping in the dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "two features are apparent : a central n  s elongated structure , encompassing features n , c and s , and an extension to the s  w coincident with feature  1 .      a simple estimate of the relative contributions of the hc and cc in hm  sge at a given wavelength can be made assuming blackbodies with t@xmath18 = 200  000  k @xcite , t@xmath19 = 3  000  k , and taking approximate radii of 0.01 and 100  r@xmath20 respectively .",
    "this shows that the hc dominates the cc by a factor @xmath21 at 220  nm [ f218w , fig  [ fig - hst2](d ) ] and the cc dominates the hc by a factor @xmath22 at 550  nm [ f547 m , fig  [ fig - hst2](b ) ] .",

    "the cc is clearly badly modeled by this estimate , as it does not account for the absorption bands characteristic of mira  types .",
    "in addition , a simple estimate of the luminosity of the hc @xcite and the contribution at @xmath232200shows that the central pixel will be entirely dominated by stellar emission , rather than nebular emission .",
    "these estimates show that if the two stars were displaced by more than a few pixels on the sky , the peak of the emission should clearly move between the f218w image and the f547 m image . that this is",
    "not the case means that both stars must be within feature  c.    as the psf of the star in each image extends to a large angular distance from the peak , we have attempted to fit a gaussian component to the peak positions in the f218w and f547 m images .",
    "the best resolution was available in our dithered images , where the pixel size is 0.02275  arcsec .",
    "the position of the peak relative to 19  41  57 + 16  44  39 in the f218w image [ fig .",
    "[ fig - hst2](d ) ] is @xmath16 = 0.08067@xmath10.00004 , @xmath24 = 0.6195@xmath10.0005 while in the f547 m image [ fig .",

    "the errors quoted are the formal uncertainties of the fits .",
    "when dithering , the measured shifts ( from the positions of bright stars in each frame ) can be up to 0.2 undithered pixels or @xmath0  9  milli  arcsec ( mas ) different from the requested value of 5.5  pixels .",
    "this is probably the best estimate we have of the true uncertainty of the measured peak shift from f218w to f547 m .",
    "thus , the peaks in the two filters are displaced from each other by 40@xmath19  mas at a position angle of 130@xmath210@xmath3 measured north through east .",
    "the position angle agrees well with that suggested by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the peak position in the f218w image is that of the hc while the peak position in the f547 m image is that of the cc .",

    "the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig - cartoon ] illustrates the relationship between the binary components and the features apparent in the inner nebula .",
    "to test further these measurements , we also looked at other observations of symbiotic stars made under our go programme . in the case of ch",
    "cyg ( paper in preparation ) , the star was known to be in eclipse during the observation , so that only one star could possibly be seen .",
    "the shift in that case was @xmath25  mas , comparable to the estimate from the dithering uncertainties , and hence consistent with the star being in eclipse .",
    "the peak positions in the other filters are not necessarily coincident with the stars as they are dominated by nebular lines .",
    "these positions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - cartoon ] . by definition",
    "these filters are sensitive to more extended emission .",
    "this means that fitting a gaussian is invalid , as the nebulosity may be asymmetrical but strongly emitting near the stars .",
    "thus a lack of coincidence between the peaks of the narrow filters and the peaks of the f218w and f547 m filters is to be expected .",
    "the h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 images have peaks very close to that of the f547 m image .",
    "the he  ii image , which traces the highest ionisation regions , has a peak between the two stars and slightly south of the binary axis , consistent with the model of @xcite . finally , the f437n and f502n images , dominated by [ o  iii ] lines which are sensitive to temperatures and densities , have peaks which differ from those of all the other images and from one another .",
    "the results for these latter three filters are most readily explained in the context of the suggested wind interaction which might be expected to have the strongest effects between the two stars .",
    "a number of diagnostics of the physical conditions in the nebula can be derived from the images presented here .",
    "the ratio @xmath26 of the f502n image ( including both [ o  iii ] @xmath144959 & 5007 ) to the f437n image ( including [ o  iii ] @xmath124363 ) depends on both electron temperature @xmath27 and density @xmath28 according to the equation @xmath29}{1 + 4.5 \\times 10^{-4}(n_e t_e^{0.5})}\\end{array } \\label{eq - roiii}\\ ] ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "examination of ground  based optical spectra indicate that these two wfpc2 filters are dominated by the three lines which contribute to the ratio , and the nebular continuum is very weak ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  2 )",
    "thus , figs .",
    "[ fig - hst1](a ) and ( b ) can be used to derive the ratio map fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](d ) which traces @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and in principle depends on both of these quantities .",
    "this diagnostic has been applied effectively to hm  sge by @xcite , using spatially ",
    "unresolved spectra for the entire nebula .    the wfpc2 charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) effect on the wfpc2 chips @xcite has a bearing on this analysis .",
    "for aperture photometry , this causes stars at the top of the chip ( row number 800 ) to appear systematically fainter than those at the bottom ( row number 0 ) .",
    "the effect is also stronger for brighter stars .",
    "the consequences of this effect for extended emission is not well understood . in our case",
    "the observed emission falls on the same region of the chip for all observations , and brightness variations are not severe across the nebula .",
    "this means that we can draw firm qualitative conclusions from fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](d ) .",
    "radio brightness , expressed as a brightness temperature @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31 where the optical depth at frequency @xmath32 is @xmath33 assuming @xmath28 is constant , where @xmath34 is the path length through the nebula ( again see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the radio brightness temperature also depends on both @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "relationships ( [ eq - roiii ] ) , ( [ eq - tb ] ) and ( [ eq - tau ] ) provide loci in a @xmath27@xmath28 plot , which intersect at the conditions appropriate to the various features . comparing figs .",

    "[ fig - compare](d ) . also shown here is the locus for the @xcite value of @xmath35 .",
    "it is clear that the main source of uncertainty in this analysis is the value adopted for @xmath34 .",
    "a reasonable estimate would be to place it at somewhere between the largest and the smallest angular size seen on the sky . when estimated in this fashion",
    ", it also depends linearly on the distance , which is not well known",
    ". however , we should still be able to draw qualitative conclusions about the relative temperatures and densities of the different regions despite this distance uncertainty .",
    "most importantly , it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](d ) that along contours of constant @xmath30 , fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](d ) primarily traces variations in @xmath27 . at the same time , variations in @xmath30 trace variations in @xmath28",
    ". we must be careful not to use this analysis to draw conclusions about those regions of the nebula where no radio emission is detected .",
    "an interferometer such as the vla will _ resolve  out _ smooth extended structure , meaning that the true extended radio brightness will generally be greater than that present in the radio map .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath26 from @xcite is effectively an average , dominated by the brightest nebular feature .",
    "we have plotted a locus in fig  [ fig - compare](d ) for the peak emission in the 23  ghz image ( the peak of feature c ) as the most relevant one for comparison with the @xcite locus .",
    "given the variable nature of the inner nebula @xcite , the values which might be derived for that central region are similar to those derived by @xcite , which were effectively a weighted average for the entire nebula .",
    "the f469n image [ fig .",
    "[ fig - hst2](c ) ] is dominated by he  ii @xmath124686 emission .",
    "this is a discriminator of strongly ionized regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it can be seen from the image that features c , n and s are visible in he  ii .",
    "this suggests that these features are strongly ionized , and is consistent with these features being well defined in the f437n and f502n images [ figs .",
    "[ fig - hst1](a ) & ( b ) ] , as [ o  iii ] shows roughly the same ionization structure .",
    "in addition , the he  ii emission does not extend far beyond a radius of @xmath01  arcsec , suggesting that the intermediate scale nebulosity is more weakly ionized than the smallest scale features .",
    "this is more difficult to reconcile with the extended structure seen particularly in fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](a ) .",
    "however , as noted above the [ o  iii ] lines seen in these filters are sensitive to temperature and density , so we may well be seeing the effects of density inhomogeneities in the nebula .",
    "such inhomogeneities are in turn consistent with the very clumpy nature of much of the emission at sub",
    " arcsec scales .",
    "a third diagnostic comes from the fact that the _ dereddenned _ h@xmath17 flux , @xmath36 , can be derived from the radio flux @xmath37 via the equation @xmath38 where @xmath36 is in erg  @xmath39s@xmath40 .",
    "this assumes the radio flux is due to optically thin thermal emission .",
    "thus , with a measured h@xmath17 flux we can derive the reddening e(b  v ) .",
    "in the past this has been used to derive the interstellar reddening using the total radio and h@xmath17 fluxes . however , in dusty environments such as that seen in hm  sge , there may be a contribution to the reddening from circumstellar matter . such variations in circumstellar reddening have been suggested to explain the different estimates of e(b  v ) and a@xmath6 towards hm  sge in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case , the images of both h@xmath17 emission [ fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](c ) ] and radio emission [ e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig - radio](a ) ] allow us to derive an extinction map , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) for @xmath27 = 10  000  k. we note that @xcite present a spatially  unresolved radio  infrared spectrum for hm  sge , indicating that the turn  over from optically thick to thin radio emission occurs at 8.5  ghz . however , it is clear from their fig .  1 that the turn  over is gradual , consistent with partially optically thin emission up to @xmath030  ghz .",
    "in addition , the inner nebula of hm  sge is variable in both brightness and structure ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , making the spectrum of @xcite out of date .",
    "this means that it remains difficult to assess the optical depth conditions within the inner nebula as a function of position .",
    "the consequences of the cte effect for fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) are to provide an overestimate of the extinction , with the largest over estimates being at the brightest parts of fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](c ) .",
    "this extinction map is also affected by our assumptions about the radio emission .",
    "equation  [ eq - eb - v ] relies on the assumption that the radio emission is optically thin thermal . while the brightness temperatures are consistent with thermal emission , the optical depth is not well constrained .",
    "however , where emission is optically thick , we would underestimate the extinction . as the brightest radio emission most likely comes from the regions of greatest optical depth , this effect works in the opposite sense to the cte effect . finally , e(b  v ) depends on electron temperature .",
    "if @xmath27 = 40  000  k , instead of the 10  000  k assumed above , e(b  v ) would decrease by @xmath0  0.2 .",
    "[ fig - compare](d ) demonstrates that @xmath27 can vary considerably over the nebula .",
    "however , for the larger values of @xmath30 in the inner regions relationships ( [ eq - tb ] ) and ( [ eq - tau ] ) lead to loci at higher electron densities , while the curves derived from equation ( [ eq - roiii ] ) converge towards lower @xmath27 , and extend over a narrower range of temperatures .",
    "thus in the inner regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) the variations in @xmath27 are relatively small . as the hotter regions are closest to the white dwarf , it seems likely that the intermediate values of e(b  v ) = 0.7 may be somewhat reduced by the expected higher @xmath27 in that region .",
    "bearing in mind these considerations , we are confident that we can draw qualitative conclusions from fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) .",
    "the extinction map in fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) can be taken to trace the circumstellar variation in the dust distribution , assuming the interstellar extinction is reasonably uniform over the relatively small angular size of the inner nebula . in this case ,",
    "the best estimate of the true interstellar extinction comes from the minimum values in the extinction map .",
    "three distinct regions are apparent : ( i ) to the south e(b  v ) @xmath41 1 , coincident with feature  s ; ( ii ) to the north around feature  n ,",
    "e(b  v ) @xmath41 0.6 , consistent with previous reddening estimates ; and ( iii ) a low  ratio band running from east to west across the position of feature  c. note that the peak itself does not give a reliable e(b  v ) estimate , as the emission in the optical is not entirely nebular .",
    "this band is also weakly contaminated by the diffraction spikes , which have a position angle of @xmath42",
    ". the eastern part of this low",
    " ratio band has e(b  v ) = 0.35 , the lowest value on the map , and presumably the best estimate of the true interstellar extinction . as high e(b ",
    "v ) correlates with a greater quantity of dust , we can see that the dust is concentrated at feature  s. in addition , there is a deficit of dust closer to feature  c in fig .",
    "[ fig - hst1](a ) , especially immediately to the east .",
    "this clumping of the dust at small scales was suggested by @xcite , based on discrepancies in reddening estimates .",
    "our maximum value of e(b  v )  @xmath41  1 gives a@xmath43  3.1 for interstellar dust @xcite , which is much lower than the value of a@xmath4 12 of @xcite but similar to other estimates both before and after that time .",
    "much more recently , spectro  polarimetry by @xcite demonstrated that the mira was clearly visible , in agreement with the significant reduction in a@xmath6 since 1980 we see here .",
    "results from the infrared space observatory ( schild et al . , submitted ) are consistent with a two  component dust model , with optical depths comparable to those derivable from our e(b  v ) values .",
    "such a model is also consistent with the extinction map in fig  [ fig - compare](c ) , particularly as the schild et al .",
    "modeling suggests that at least one of the components is clumpy .",
    "we suggest that the highest concentration of dust , at feature  s , is associated with the cc wind .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) is blanked beyond the 1@xmath44 level of the vla image , as no useful information can be derived beyond this limit .",
    "hence , we have no knowledge about the dust distribution beyond that region .",
    "the minimum in the extinction map fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) places the interstellar extinction at no more than e(b  v ) = 0.35 .",
    "this is an upper limit because there may be a circumstellar contribution to the minimum .",
    "this gives an interstellar total extinction @xmath451.1 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite provide maps of the galactic extinction versus distance .",
    "hm  sge lies at the edge of their field 265 ( see figs .  5 and 6 m of @xcite ) . for @xmath46 = 1.1 , the minimum distance to hm  sge is approximately 700  pc , although measurements of similar @xmath46 are shown in field  265 for distances as low as 400  pc and as high as 2  kpc .",
    "comparison with the extinction maps of @xcite suggest a distance of @xmath0800  pc for this value of e(b  v ) .",
