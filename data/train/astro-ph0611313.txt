    "when these measurements are combined with high angular resolution maps of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( e.g. hinshaw et  al . 2003 , 2007 ) , tight constraints can be derived on many of the parameters in the cold dark matter model ( e.g. sanchez et  al .",

    ", the emphasis in large scale structure studies is shifting to measuring the clustering signal for samples of galaxies defined by intrinsic properties such as luminosity , colour , morphology or spectral type , with the goal of developing our understanding of the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "the sdss and 2dfgrs catalogues contain sufficiently large numbers of galaxies over a large enough volume to allow robust measurements of clustering to be made for such subsamples ( e.g. norberg et  al .",

    "dressler ( 1980 ) argued that galaxies follow a morphology - density relation , with the fraction of early - type galaxies increasing with the local density .",
    "galaxy clusters have well defined red sequences in the colour - magnitude relation ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "analyses of the 2dfgrs and sdss data sets have probed the connection between density and galaxy colour or type over a wider range of environments than was previously possible to reveal a general bimodality in the galaxy population ( e.g. lewis et  al .",

    "these results suggest a tight correlation between the nature of a galaxy and its local environment , or equivalently the mass of its host dark matter halo .",
    "measures of the clustering amplitude of different populations of galaxies reveal different results , indicating that these populations sample the underlying mass distribution in different ways .",
    "hence , such clustering measurements can potentially tell us how the efficiency of the galaxy formation process depends upon halo mass .",

    "we present our results for the higher - order clustering of 2dfgrs galaxies selected by both luminosity and colour .",

    "full details of the clustering measurements and a complete discussion of their interpretation can be found in the above references ; in this section , for completeness , we provide a brief outline of the 2dfgrs (   2.1 ) , the statistics measured (   2.2 and   2.3 ) and give a recap of the implications of the higher - order clustering statistics for galaxy bias (   2.4 ) .",
    "our analysis employs the completed 2dfgrs ( colless et  al . 2001 ; 2003 ) which contains a total of 221,414 unique , high quality galaxy redshifts down to a nominal magnitude limit of @xmath5 with a median redshift @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to @xmath7-band magnitudes , @xmath8-band images have now been scanned , allowing a @xmath9 colour to be defined for each galaxy . to maximise the volume sampled ,",

    "the remaining incompleteness is accounted for using the volume weighting corrections described in croton et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "in order to construct a volume limited subsample from a flux limited redshift survey , it is necessary to model the redshift dependence of a galaxy s luminosity or magnitude in the passband in which the survey selection is defined .",
    "we apply the colour dependent @xmath13-correction model of cole et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) to account for the average change in galaxy magnitude due to redshifting of the @xmath7-filter bandpass ( the `` k - correction '' ) and also the associated typical galaxy evolution ( the `` e - correction '' ) .",
    "the purpose of defining a volume limited sample is to isolate galaxies of similar intrinsic luminosity in a sample with a simple radial selection function to facilitate clustering measurements ( see norberg et  al . 2001 ; 2002a ) .",
    "once such a sample has been constructed , we can subdivide it by galaxy colour , using the @xmath7 and @xmath8-band photometry available for 2dfgrs data .",

    "our analysis covers a wide range of luminosity , from @xmath16  0.2@xmath17to @xmath16  4  @xmath17 ( the mean effective luminosities of the volume limited samples differ by a factor of 6 from the faintest to brightest ) .",
    "the error bars plotted on our measurements in each of the figures are jackknife estimates derived by subdividing each sample into 20 areas on the sky .",
    "our measurements are strongly correlated from bin to bin , so it is essential to take this into account when fitting models to the measurements . for the purpose of deriving confidence intervals on fitted parameters , we compute a full covariance matrix using the ensemble of mock 2dfgrs catalogues described by norberg et  al .",

    ".      the distribution of galaxies could be quite different from that of the underlying dark matter .",
    "one could conceive of physical processes which could lead to a dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation on the mass and perhaps the environment of dark matter hales ( e.g. croton , gao & white 2007 ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , galaxies should be regarded as _ biased _ tracers of the matter distribution .",
    "a simple model for galaxy bias was introduced by fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 ) .",
    "these authors assumed that the density contrast in the galaxy distribution , @xmath89 , can be expressed as a general non - linear function of the density contrast of the dark matter , @xmath90 , so that : @xmath91 $ ] . for density fluctuations smoothed on large enough scales",
    "so that the matter density contrast is of the order unity or smaller , this relation can be expanded in a taylor series : @xmath92 on scales where the variance , @xmath93 , is small , the leading order contribution to the variance is dominated by the linear term : @xmath94 ^ 2 ,   \\label{eq : b1}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the so - called `` linear bias '' , @xmath96 .",
    "the leading order term in the expansion for the skewness , @xmath40 , is : @xmath97 where we use the notation @xmath98 ( expressions for the hierarchical amplitudes up to @xmath99 are given in fry & gaztaaga 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath100 encodes the non - linear gravitational evolution of the matter distribution from gaussian initial conditions .",
    "hence , two non - linear effects are present in @xmath101 : gravity ( i.e. as contained in @xmath100 ) and galaxy bias ( i.e. as quantified by @xmath102 )",
    ". both terms are modulated by the linear bias , @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , in general , the interpretation of the skewness measured in the galaxy distribution is not trivial .",
    "however , on weakly non - linear scales we have detailed models of what to expect for the skewness of the dark matter ( see , for example , bernardeau et  al .",
    "2002 ; calculations have also been carried out for non - standard gravitational models and cosmologies  see gaztaaga & lobo 2001 ) .",
    "we can therefore hope to learn about non - linear galaxy biasing if we can measure the skewness in the galaxy distribution , @xmath103 , on scales on which the underlying fluctuations are only weakly nonlinear .",
    "it is useful to define a _ relative _ bias to aid with the interpretation of measurements of higher - order clustering .",
    "the relative bias describes the change in clustering signal compared to that measured for a reference sample . using eq .",
    "[ eq : b1 ] as a guide , we define the relative linear bias of a sample , @xmath104 , as the square root of the ratio of the @xmath105-point correlation function ( or variance ) measured for the sample , relative to that found for the reference sample , denoted by an asterisk : @xmath106 our reference sample is the volume limited population of galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath107 , which is one magnitude brighter than the one used in croton et  al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "the reason for choosing a brighter sample is directly related to the influence the large coherent superstructures have on the @xmath4 sample : it makes more sense to use as reference a sample which is not systematically affected by the presence of such rare massive structure . for completeness , in table  1 we show the relative bias results for the volume limited `` all colour '' catalogues analysed in croton et al .",

    "in this section we present the main results of the paper , which are inferred from our measurement of the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) , as outlined in section 2 , for the samples of red and blue galaxies listed in table  1 .",
    "we present the volume averaged correlation functions , @xmath0 , in   3.1 , the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath29 , in   3.2 , and the reduced void probability function ( vpf ) in   3.3 .",

    "the order of volume averaged correlation function is indicated by the symbol type shown in the legend .",
    "red galaxies clearly show a larger clustering amplitude than the equivalent population of blue galaxies , as expected from earlier results obtained for the two - point correlation function as a function of colour ( e.g. zehavi et  al .",
    "2005 in the sdss ) or spectral type ( norberg et  al . 2002a",
    "; madgwick et  al .",
    "2003 in the 2dfgrs ) .",
    "the dependence of clustering strength on galaxy luminosity appears to be the strongest for the blue population , with the faintest blue galaxies being more weakly clustered than the brightest .",
    "the situation is more complicated for red galaxies ; both the faintest and brightest samples of red galaxies appear to be more strongly clustered than the red @xmath122 sample .",
    "there is even a suggestion that the faintest red galaxies become the more strongly clustered with increasing order , although the errors on the measurements are also increasing at a fixed scale for higher values of @xmath123 .",
    "this type of behaviour was noted previously for the two - point correlation function .",
    "norberg et  al .",
    "( 2002b ) found an increase in the correlation length of early spectral types for samples faintwards of @xmath4 , with the faintest early types displaying a similar correlation length to the brightest early types .",
    "zehavi et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a similar increase in clustering strength for faint red galaxies .",
    "this trend can be readily explained ; the satellite population in massive clusters is predominantly made up of faint , red galaxies and clusters are known to be strongly biased tracers of the mass distribution ( e.g. padilla et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] extends the results presented in the previous subsection by plotting the hierarchical amplitudes ( as defined by eq .",

    "this is done for red galaxies in the left panel and blue galaxies in the right panel .",
    "again , the results are shown for samples with different luminosities , with symbols representing the measurement of galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath120 , and dashed and dotted lines showing the @xmath29 for samples one magnitude brighter and fainter than this respectively .",
    "red galaxies show a strong segregation of the hierarchical amplitudes with luminosity at a given clustering order ; the @xmath29 for blue galaxies show little dependence on luminosity .    on large scales , n - body simulations and",
    "perturbation theory suggest that the hierarchical amplitudes for the mass should only vary slowly with scale in the case of initially gaussian fluctuations which grow through gravitational instability ( e.g. juskiewicz , bouchet & colombi 1993 ; baugh et  al .",
    "1995 ; for a summary of the theoretical predictions , see bernardeau et  al .",
    "observationally , the hierarchical amplitudes for galaxies have traditionally been measured to be either approximately constant or decreasing slowly out to progressively larger smoothing scales ( e.g. gaztaaga 1992 ; bouchet et  al .",
    "1993 ; gaztaaga 1994 ; hoyle , szapudi & baugh 2000 ; frith , outram & shanks 2006 ; see bernardeau et  al .",
    "2002 for a review of previous measurements ) .",
    "however , recent work has shown that the presence of large , rare superstructures in the galaxy distribution can produce a significant upturn in the value of @xmath29 on large scales ( e.g. szapudi & gaztaaga 1998 ; baugh et  al . 2004 ; croton et  al .",
    "2004b ; nichol et  al .",
    "according to figure 10 from gaztaaga et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the upturn in the hierarchical amplitudes appears to be equally important when using measurements of the 3-point correlations function of red and blue galaxies from the 2dfgrs @xmath124 sample .",
    "nevertheless , it should be emphasised that , in the case of the 2dfgrs , the impact of the superstructures on the measured hierarchical amplitudes is most pronounced in the @xmath125 volume limited sample and is essentially negligible in the brighter and fainter samples .",
    "this is due to the superstructures falling entirely within the redshift interval spanned by the @xmath4 sample . in the case of the fainter volume limited sample ,",
    "the superstructures lie mostly beyond the maximum redshift which defines the sample , whilst in the case of the brighter sample , the volume covered is much larger and the significance of the superstructures is correspondingly lower .",
    "see croton et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) , baugh et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and gaztaaga et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) for detailed investigations into how these two superstructures affect the measurement of higher - order statistics .",
    "the flatness of the earlier results for the @xmath29 can be understood by noting that a ) most smaller surveys never intersected with these rare superstructures of galaxies , b ) their influence for larger surveys , such as the original 2dfgrs parent catalogue , the apm survey ( i.e. gaztaaga 1994 ) or 2mass ( frith , outram & shanks 2006 ) , was diluted by the significant increase in sample volume , and c ) typically any contribution from large coherent superstructures is downgraded in a flux limited catalogue rather than a volume limited sample due to the varying selection function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the grey shaded regions show the results for the hierarchical amplitudes measured from the @xmath121 sample after removing the two large superstructures identified in baugh et  al .",
    "the shaded regions indicate the extent of the @xmath126 errors on the measurements and should be compared with the symbols and error bars , which show the results for the same volume limited sample but _ without _ removing the superstructures from the cic analysis . by omitting the two superstructures ,",
    "the theoretically expected constant behaviour of @xmath127 is restored for larger smoothing lengths .",
    "however , whilst the results change on large scales for @xmath41 and @xmath42 on removing the superstructures , there is still significant scale dependence of the @xmath29 with opposite gradients found for red and blue galaxies . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the impression is that the red population is the most strongly affected by the presence of the superstructures can be derived . ] .",
    "this behaviour should be contrasted with the measurements by croton et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) and baugh et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) made using the full l@xmath128 sample . in these papers , removing the superstructures from the cic analysis , led , to within the accuracy of the measurements , to all the hierarchical moments up to 5@xmath129 order becoming roughly independent of scale .",
    "our results for red and blue galaxies imply that the @xmath122 results for all galaxies were due to a fortuitous cancellation of the trends with scale seen for red and blue galaxies .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the upturn seen on small scales in both @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the bright and faint populations of blue galaxies is not statistically significant : in both cases , the jackknife errors , if plotted , are fully consistent with no upturn at all .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the reduced void probability function ( vpf ) for the three luminosity samples ( using different symbols as shown by the legend ) and for red and blue galaxy populations ( left and right hand panels respectively ) .",
    "previous measurements have revealed that galaxy samples defined by luminosity ( or equivalently number density ) display a universal form for the vpf ( e.g. croton et  al .",
    "2004a ; hoyle & vogeley 2004 ; patiri et  al .",
    "this universality also holds for samples at different redshifts ( conroy et  al . 2005 ; 2007 ) .",
    "the recovery of a universal form for the vpf is evidence for the hierarchical scaling of the higher - order correlation functions of galaxies ( e.g. eq  [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "the actual form of the vpf curve is well described , in redshift space , by the negative binomial model ( see also fry 1986 and gaztaaga & yokoyama 1993 ) .    here",
    "we report a significant departure from the universal scaling of the vpf . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the vpf measured for _ red _ galaxies deviates from the universal scaling in a way such that the deviation is strongest for the faintest galaxies considered .",
    "the vpf measured for blue galaxies , on the other hand , shows no dependence on luminosity , and matches almost perfectly the negative binomial model across the entire range plotted . note that the deviation seen for the red @xmath121 population appears to arise from the contribution of the two superstructures discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "once these large structures are removed from the analysis and the vpf is recalculated , the results for the @xmath121 sample shift back to the negative binomial model , as shown by the grey shaded region . on the other hand , the fainter red galaxy sample ( shown by the triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , which is not affected by the two superstructures , does not agree with the negative binomial model .",
    "this disagreement persists if we consider even fainter samples , which we have not plotted in the figure for clarity .",
    "our results show that once we have accounted for the difference in mean density and clustering , faint red galaxies have a characteristically larger vpf than is measured for the other galaxy samples . from eq .",
    "[ eq : vpf ] , we expect that samples with a larger vpf should also also have larger values for the @xmath29 , and this is borne out by the results given in table  1 , which are discussed in the next section .",
    "a high value for @xmath29 indicates non - linear biasing . if one were to simply increase the _ linear _ bias , this would increase the amplitude of the correlation functions , @xmath0 , but would reduce the hierarchical amplitudes ( see eq .  [ eq : sp ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : sjlinear ] ) . a non - zero non - linear bias is characteristic of the high density regions of the dark matter distribution .",
    "this is in line with the suggestion made above that the red faint galaxies could be made up of a significant population of satellites in clusters .",
    "the reasons behind the success of the negative binomial model for the vpf are unclear .",
    "vogeley et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that the vpf measured in their simulations only agreed with the negative binomial model when the clustering pattern was distorted by peculiar motions ; the vpf measured in real space did not match the negative binomial model .",
    "however , our results imply that the peculiar motions of galaxies are not the primary agent responsible for the success of the negative binomial model .",
    "we find that the faint red galaxies , which are primarily satellites within galaxy clusters and hence likely to display large peculiar motions , in fact show the strongest departure from the vpf predicted by the negative binomial model , rather than being driven towards this model .",
    "in this section we give some simple interpretations of the measurements of the hierarchical amplitudes reported in section  [ sec : sp ] .",
    "this requires us to perform fits to the measurements , in the first case by extracting best fitting values for the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath29 ( as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : sp ] ) , and then to constrain the linear and non - linear bias parameters ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : br ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : c2 ] ) .    measures of the hierarchical amplitudes on different smoothing scales are correlated , a fact which has often been ignored in previous analyses reported in the literature . the existence of a bin - to - bin correlation is clearly demonstrated by the response of our estimates of the hierarchical amplitudes to the removal of the two largest superstructures in the 2dfgrs . given this correlation , it is necessary to construct a covariance matrix for the measurements in order to carry out meaningful fits .",
    "one way to do this is to use a jackknife approach in which the survey volume is split into a number of equal sized subvolumes , on the order of 20 ( if not more to construct a stable covariance matrix ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is infeasible for our fainter volume limited samples , as the volume covered in these cases is too small to be subdivided an appropriate number of times .",
    "instead , we use the ensemble of mock 2dfgrs catalogues whose construction is described in norberg et  al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "particles were chosen from an n - body simulation to represent galaxies using a simple parametric function of the local smoothed density of dark matter ( see cole et  al .",
    "1998 for a description of the bias algorithm ) .",
    "the parameters in this empirical biasing prescription were constrained to reproduce the typical clustering measured in the full flux limited 2dfgrs ( hawkins et  al .",
    "consequently , one limitation of the mock catalogues is that the luminosity and colour assigned to a `` galaxy '' is independent of the local density of the particle .",
    "this means that the mocks do not display any dependence of clustering on luminosity or colour .",
    "also , no information about the higher - order clustering of mock galaxies was used to select the parameters in the bias prescription .",
    "hence , although the two point correlation function for mock galaxies agrees very closely with that measured for the full 2dfgrs , there is no guarantee that the higher - order clustering in the mocks will look like that measured in the real survey .",
    "as we found in our earlier work using the mocks ( croton et  al .",
    "2004b ; gaztaaga et  al .",
    "2005 ) , the covariance matrices estimated from the mocks are stable and give robust estimates of best fitting quantities and the associated errors .",
    "a principal component decomposition of the covariance matrix reveals that the first few eigenvectors are typically responsible for the bulk of the variance or signal .",
    "we rank the eigenvectors in order of decreasing variance and retain sufficient eigenvectors to account for , at least , 95% of the variance .",
    "we first perform fits to extract values for the scale _ independent _ hierarchical amplitudes .",
    "although our results may appear in some cases to show a strong dependence on cell radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , it is important to bear in mind that we can only show the diagonal part of the covariance matrix in plots and our fitting procedure takes into account the covariance between bins .",
    "moreover , since there is a tradition of fitting constants to estimates of the @xmath29 over a range of scales , it is useful to repeat such an analysis for our measurements in order to facilitate comparisons with previous work . we restrict our attention to the @xmath29 values obtained for spheres with radii in the range @xmath130mpc .",
    "these are slightly larger scales than we used in croton et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) , since we aim to avoid scales which may be affected by shot noise , and our samples , as a result of being split by colour , typically have half the number of galaxies in each luminosity bin than before . to help with a comparison to our earlier work we also re - analyse",
    "the `` all colour '' galaxy catalogues across this new fitting range ( note that these galaxies also differ in their improved @xmath13 corrections , as described in section  [ survey ] ) .",
    "the results of a one parameter fit ( @xmath29 ) to the hierarchical amplitudes are quoted as a function of luminosity for all galaxy colours and also the red and blue populations separately in table  [ table1 ] , in which we also give the 95  % confidence interval around the best fitting value .",
    "next we constrain the relative bias parameters defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : br ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : c2 ] . recall that in this paper we define our reference sample to be volume limited galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath107 .",
    "the error in the relative linear bias is straightforward to find using the mocks and the results are given in table  1 . obtaining a robust fit for the nonlinear bias , @xmath131 ,",
    "is more subtle . by construction",
    ", the mocks will return a zero nonlinear bias . ] , whereas the expectation value for 2dfgrs samples can be anything .",
    "therefore , in order to get a reliable estimate of the error on the best fitting nonlinear bias using the mocks , we need to take an indirect approach .",
    "we fit instead the combination @xmath132 , for which the mock catalogues are in rather good agreement with the real survey . taking the best fitting value for the quantity @xmath133 , and the skewness measured for the reference sample , we can obtain a best fitting value for the nonlinear bias , @xmath131 , using eq .",
    "[ eq : c2 ] . the error on the best fitting value",
    "is obtained by adding the errors on @xmath132 and the skewness of the reference sample in quadrature , ie .",
    "assuming @xmath133 and @xmath134 are uncorrelated .",
    "the resulting values of the nonlinear bias and the error on the best fit are listed in table  1 .",
    "the results in table  1 reveal substantial differences in the hierarchical amplitudes obtained for red and blue galaxies and in the way in which these amplitudes change with luminosity .",
    "overall , we find that blue galaxies display smaller hierarchical amplitudes than red galaxies .",
    "red galaxies show a significant change in @xmath29 with luminosity , whereas blue galaxies show no such trend . assuming gaussian errors",
    ", we find a 3-@xmath135 shift in the best fitting @xmath40 between the faintest and brightest samples of red galaxies . in view of the relatively small baseline in luminosity",
    "over which we can perform such a fit , a factor of six in median luminosity moving from the faintest to the brightest volume limited sample , it is remarkable to see such a clear change in the higher - order clustering .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those found in croton et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) ( see their fig .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the relative bias @xmath136 quoted in table  1 , shows the opposite tendency to that displayed by the hierarchical amplitudes : there is little dependence of the linear relative bias on luminosity for red galaxies and a clear trend for blue galaxies .",
    "finally , it is encouraging to note that the conclusions we draw from our counts - in - cells analysis are consistent with those we reported in gaztaaga et  al .",
    "( 2005 , sags - ii ) , who measured the 3-point correlation function for different triangle shapes and sizes ( i.e. without averaging over the volume of a cell ) .",
    "in particular fig.7 in sags - ii shows how for both equilateral and elongated triangles , late galaxies show little luminosity segregation in @xmath137 , while early galaxies show a strong segregation , with @xmath137 increasing with decreasing luminosity ( see also nishimichi et  al .",
    "this paper complements and extends previous clustering analyses of the 2dfgrs , taking advantage of the availability of @xmath8-band photometry to study the spatial distribution of galaxies as a function of _ both _ their colour and luminosity .",
    "we use a counts - in - cells approach to estimate the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) of red and blue galaxies in different luminosity bins , spanning a factor of six in luminosity around @xmath122 . from the cpdf",
    ", we estimate the volume - averaged higher - order correlation functions , @xmath0 , the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath29 , and the reduced void probability function for our galaxy samples , @xmath82 .",
    "we use our measurements of the hierarchical amplitudes to constrain the linear and nonlinear bias parameters in a simple model of galaxy clustering .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarised as follows :    * _ colour segregation in @xmath0 : _ blue galaxies show significantly lower clustering amplitudes than red galaxies .",
    "this trend holds up to the five point correlation function , extending the results previously reported for two - point correlations ( e.g. norberg et  al .",
    "2002a ; madgwick et  al .",
    "2003 ; zehavi et  al .",
    "* _ luminosity segregation in @xmath0 : _ blue galaxies display a monotonic increase of clustering strength with luminosity , mirroring the results found for the two - point function of 2dfgrs galaxies ( norberg et  al .",
    "the behaviour of the red population is more complicated .",
    "faint and bright red galaxies are more clustered than @xmath122 red galaxies .",
    "a hint of this behaviour was previously found for the two - point correlation function of early spectral types in the 2dfgrs ( which loosely correspond to the red sample in this paper ) by norberg et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) . *",
    "_ luminosity segregation in @xmath29 : _ we fit scale - independent models to the hierarchical amplitudes which take into account the full covariance between adjacent bins . from this",
    "we conclude that the hierarchical amplitudes of blue galaxies show little or no dependence on galaxy luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the hierarchical amplitudes of red galaxies vary strongly with luminosity .",
    "these new results , split by colour , explain why croton et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) found only a weak dependence of the @xmath29 on luminosity . *",
    "_ superstructures in the 2dfgrs .",
    "_ the hierarchical amplitudes for the red galaxies seems to be more affected by the presence of the superstructures . after removing them",

    "( 2004b ) and baugh et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , after removing the superstructures , are due to a fortuitous cancellation of the different trends with scale for red and blue galaxies .",
    "* _ the reduced void probability function .",
    "_ croton et  al .",
    "( 2004a ) found that the reduced void probability function measured for 2dfgrs samples defined by luminosity displayed a universal form , and matches the one predicted by a negative binomial distribution .",
    "splitting the samples by colour , we find that blue galaxies show the universal reduced void probability function consistent with the negative binomial , but red galaxies do not .",
    "the deviation from the negative binomial model is largest for faint red galaxies .",
    "this result is seemingly at odds with previous interpretations of the success of the negative binomial model , in which it was suggested that galaxy peculiar motions were the primary agent behind the form of the reduced void probability function . *",
    "_ linear and non - linear bias .",
    "_ fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 ) introduced a simple model of galaxy bias in which the density contrast in galaxies is written as a taylor expansion of the density contrast in the underlying mass .",
    "the first order bias term in this expansion is the common linear bias and the second order term is called the quadratic or nonlinear bias .",
    "we use our measurements of the variance and the skewness ( @xmath29 ) to extract the linear and nonlinear bias parameters relative to the clustering in a reference sample .",
    "the reference sample is the one for which we are able to make our best measurements of galaxy clustering . in this paper , galaxies with magnitudes in the range @xmath138",
    "are treated as the reference sample ; there is a reference sample for red galaxies and one for blue galaxies .",
    "the relative bias parameters extracted for red and blue galaxies are different .",
    "the faintest red galaxies we consider have a linear bias consistent with that of the reference sample ; red @xmath122 galaxies have a linear bias below unity . for blue galaxies , the linear bias increases with luminosity .",
    "the relative non - linear bias for red galaxies is positive whereas that extracted for blue galaxies is negative . in all cases , these offsets are significant at the @xmath139 level .    our measurements of the higher - order clustering of galaxies as a function of colour and luminosity provide valuable new constraints on models of galaxy formation . while the colour of a galaxy is determined by its star formation history , the clustering of galaxies , at least on the scales probed in this paper , is driven primarily by the mass of the host dark matter halo and to a lesser extent by the formation history of the halo ( gao et  al . 2005 ; harker et  al .",

    "_ predictions for the star formation histories of galaxies in a cosmological setting ( see the review by baugh 2006 ) .",
    "this is done through simple physical prescriptions that describe those aspects of galaxy evolution believed to be important , including the rate of gas cooling , the timescale for star formation in galactic disks , mergers between galaxies , and feedback processes such as heating by supernova explosions or the accretion of material onto supermassive black holes .",
    "these processes are poorly understood and consequently , there is no unique way in which to model them .",
    "at present there are a number of galaxy formation models which follow the evolution of disks and spheroids from high redshift to the present day ( e.g. baugh et  al . 2005 ; croton et  al . 2006 ; bower et  al . 2006 ; cattaneo et  al . 2006",
    "; de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "the parameters that constrain the simple physics assumed in these models are typically set without reference to galaxy clustering .",
