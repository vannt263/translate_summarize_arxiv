    "the standard model ( sm ) of high energy physics suffers from the gauge hierarchy problem and the flavor problem .",
    "the first is the fine tuning required to maintain a low electroweak mass scale ( @xmath3 ) in the theory , in the presence of a high scale , the planck scale ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the second problem is a lack of explanation of the mass hierarchy and mixings of the quarks and leptons .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) eliminates the gauge hierarchy problem by introducing for each sm particle , a new particle with the same mass but different spin .",
    "for example , for each sm quark / lepton a new scalar ( squark / slepton ) , and for each sm gauge boson a new fermion ( gaugino ) , is introduced . if susy is realized in nature , the fact that we do not see such new particles , we believe , could be because susy is spontaneously broken , making the superpartners heavier than the mass ranges probed by experiments .",
    "owing to a lack of understanding of how exactly susy is broken , a phenomenologically general lagrangian , for example , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , is usually considered to compare with data .",
    "various experimental searches have placed constraints on the masses and couplings in the mssm .",
    "attempts have been made to address the flavor problem by proposing various flavor symmetries . in a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "a flavor symmetry in the quark sector might imply a certain structure in the scalar sector , leading to definite predictions for flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes on which experiments have placed severe constraints . in the literature , a lot of attention has been devoted toward analyzing the minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) scenario , in which the scalar flavor structure is aligned with the quark sector so that the two are simultaneously diagonalized . in mfv , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) matrix describes the flavor changing interactions in the supersymmetric sector as well , and the only cp violating phase is the one in the ckm matrix . in this work , we do not assume such an alignment , and we will consider non - minimal flavor violation ( nmfv ) , which we treat as a perturbation over the mfv case .    in this paper",
    "we wish to explore in what form a supersymmetric extension of the sm , with a u(2 ) flavor symmetry , could influence k and b physics observables .",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to the quark and scalar - quark ( squark ) sectors .",
    "we consider an `` effective supersymmetry ''  @xcite framework , with heavy ( tev scale ) first two generation squarks , in order to escape neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) constraints .",
    "this allows the possibility of having large cp violating phases in the squark sector .",
    "we consider a supersymmetric u(2 ) theory  @xcite , impose recent @xmath1 and @xmath0 meson experimental constraints and obtain predictions for , , , ,   mixing and the dilepton asymmetry in @xmath2 .",
    "though we consider a specific flavor symmetry , namely u(2 ) , our conclusions would hold for any model with a sizable off - diagonal 32 element in the squark mass matrix .",
    "some @xmath0 physics consequences in a supersymmetric u(2 ) theory have been considered in ref .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ u2susy.sec ] we specify the supersymmetric u(2 ) theory we will work with , and the choices we make for the various susy and susy breaking parameters . in sections  [ kmix.sec ]  and  [ db2.sec ] we consider @xmath7 ( kaon mixing ) and @xmath8 (  and  mixing ) fcnc process , respectively . in section  [ db1.sec ]",
