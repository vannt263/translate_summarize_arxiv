    "the disorder - induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has been studied extensively for decades @xcite and continues to attract much attention . scaling theory",
    "@xcite predicts that all eigenstates of noninteracting electrons are localized in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems for any amount of disorder .",
    "it is commonly believed that mit occurs only for dimensions @xmath1 and the system remain insulator for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , recently , it was suggested that a 2d anderson model of localization with purely off - diagonal disorder might violate this general statement since non - localized states were found at the band center @xcite .",
    "it was found that a transition present in this 2d model can be described by a localization length which diverges with a power - law behaviour .",
    "the possible existence of the anderson transition in 2d systems without  interaction and spin - orbit effects becomes recently a subject of controversy in the literature @xcite .",
    "more recently , asada et al . @xcite studied the @xmath3 function that describes the scaling of the quantity @xmath4 as :    @xmath5    where @xmath4 is the ratio of the quasi - one - dimensional localization length to the system width for electrons on a long quasi - one - dimensional system of width @xmath6 .",
    "they indicated the possibility of an anderson transition for dimensions @xmath7 in disordered systems of non - interacting electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "strong numerical evidence of a mobility edge was found in disordered photonic systems in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "recently , surprising results were found in the properties of disordered graphene systems @xcite.the latest studies , both theoretical and experimental , led to the amazing conclusion that there is no localization in disordered graphene , even in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) situation .",
    "it is well known that the conductance @xmath8  is not a self - averaged quantity @xcite and therefore fluctuates with the fermi energy , chemical potential and sample size .",
    "since the conductance does not obey the central limit theorem @xcite , it is necessary to investigate not only the first two moments but the entire probability distribution .",
    "numerical results in 2d and 3d disordered systems showed that the conductance is normally distributed in the metallic regime while for strongly localized systems ( insulating regime ) a log - normal distribution was found @xcite .",
    "the exact form of the probability distribution at the transition is not well known .",
    "in such a regime , it was proven that  the conductance distribution is independent of the microscopic details of the model ( determined by the distribution of the disorder ) , of the system size and of the position of the critical point which separates the metallic and the localized regime in the phase space of external parameters ( energy , disorder ) .",
    "the universality of the conductance distribution was studied and confirmed by markos et al . for 2d and 3d models @xcite .",
    "the system - size invariance of the conductance distribution at the critical points of the mit was confirmed for 3d and 4d systems in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of an anderson transition in 1d spatially disordered systems of noninteracting electron .",
    "three regimes of electron transport are studied : the insulating regime corresponding to strong disorder , the metallic regime ( corresponding to an infinitesimal disorder ) and the transition regime . in the present work ,",
    "levy statistics @xcite are used .",
    "we consider a kronig - penney model applied to a 1d system of delta potentials with random positions ( spatial disorder ) .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation can be read :    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the single particle wave - function at @xmath11 , @xmath12 the potential strength and @xmath13  the single particle energy in units of @xmath14 with @xmath15 the electronic effective mass .",
    "the two ends of the system are assumed to be connected ohmically to ideal leads ( where the electron moves freely )    the second order differential equation ( @xmath16 ) can be mapped by means the poincar map representation @xcite :    @xmath17 \\psi _ { n}-\\frac{\\sin ( kl_{n+1})}{\\sin ( kl_{n})}\\psi _ { n-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the value of the wave - function at site @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the electron wave number @xmath21 is the inter - atomic spacing .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 being a random variable uniformly distributed as @xmath24 ( @xmath25 being the degree of the disorder ) .    for equally spaced potentials , the interatomic spacing @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and equation @xmath28 reduces to that found by soukoulis et al.@xcite :    @xmath29 \\psi _ { n}\\ ] ]    the solution of equation ( @xmath30 ) is carried out iteratively by taking the two initial wave functions at sites @xmath31 and @xmath16 : @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "we consider here an electron having a wave number @xmath36 incident at site @xmath37 from the right ( by taking the chain length @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 scatterers ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient ( @xmath40 ) reads    @xmath41    the dimensionless conductance ( @xmath42 ) can be obtained from the transmission coefficient @xmath40 via the landauer formula for 1d systems @xcite :    @xmath43    where the factor two arises from the two possible states of the electron spin .    and the variance of conductance ( @xmath44 ) reads :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 denotes an average over different realizations of the disorder .",
    "in this section , we discuss numerical results of the conductance probability distribution for different amount of spatial disorder of 1d mesoscopic systems of delta potentials . in order to obtain the probability distribution of the conductance",
    ", we build a statistical ensemble of @xmath47samples differing only in the realization of the disorder .",
    "firstly , we examine the effect of this kind of disorder on electronic eigenstates by calculating the transmission coefficient and the conductance probability distribution .",
    "figure 1 shows the scaling of the transmission coefficient @xmath48 for different degrees of spatial disorder and for two values of electron energy @xmath49 ( corresponding to an energy in the band gap of the periodic system ) and @xmath50 ( corresponding to an energy in the allowed band , see inset of  figure 1.a ) . for strong disorder",
    "the transmission coefficient decreases exponentially with the length scale .",
    "furthermore , the localization length @xmath51 and the lyapunov exponent @xmath52(slope of the curve ) are deduced .",
    "the calculated results are presented in table i. fig.1a shows that increasing disorder leads to strong localization ( since the localization length @xmath51  decreases with the disorder strength @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous results with topological disorder i.e the disorder localizes the electronic eigenstates .",
    "however , this is not the case as shown in fig.1b where @xmath51 increases with the disorder .",
    "this behaviour was previously pointed out by nimour et al . for 1d spatially disordered systems with finite width potentials",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the disorder could either suppress or enhance the transmission in disordered grapheme superlattices @xcite .",
    ".calculated results of the lyapunov exponent @xmath53 and the localization length @xmath54 as a function of the disorder@xmath55 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     since our system is disordered , its conductance depends on specific realizations of disorder ( for a given @xmath6 ) , it is then appropriate to study the whole probability distribution of conductance . for strong disorder where @xmath56 ,",
    "we have @xmath57 , which is smaller than the size of the system . the localization of the electronic eigenstates is confirmed in figure 2a where the probability distribution of the natural logarithm of the conductance @xmath58 is plotted .  in this figure",
    "the probality distribution is gaussian indicating the general behaviour in this regime @xcite .",
    "this figure shows also that the mean conductance decreases as the system size increases . in a previous interesting paper ,",
    "vagner et al .",
    "@xcite studied analytically electron transport in a one - dimensional wire with disorder modeled as a chain of randomly positioned scatterers with @xmath59-shaped impurity potential ( similar to our model ) .",
    "they found that the distribution @xmath60 of the variable @xmath61 ( @xmath62 being the resistance ) has a non - gaussian behaviour in the limit of weak disorder .",
    "this result is confirmed for the conductance in our system .",
    "it is clearly seen from figure 2b that when the disorder decreases , the conductance distribution shows a deviation from its log - normal form indicating delocalization of the eigenstates .    in order to further understand the behaviour of the conductance",
    ", we investigate the conductance distribution @xmath63 for different amounts of spatial disorder and for different system sizes .",
    "all these distributions show long power law tails decreasing for large values of the conductance @xmath8 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "therefore , we use the levy statistics @xmath64 of index @xmath65 which decreases as @xmath66 for large values of z @xcite . it is found that the conductance distribution @xmath63 behaves as @xmath67 for large values of @xmath8 .",
    "the exponent @xmath65 is then extracted from the log - log plot of @xmath63 for large values of @xmath8 which is linear with a slope equal to @xmath68 ( see the inset ) .",
    "it is known that if  @xmath69 , the probability distribution is normal . on the other hand , if @xmath70  it means that the distribution is log - normal . in figure 4 , the index @xmath65 is plotted as a function of degree of spatial disorder @xmath25 and for different system size @xmath6 . in this figure two distinguishable regions are shwn : a region of @xmath70 ( corresponding to an insulating regime ) and a region of @xmath71 ( corresponding to a metallic regime for small disorder @xmath25 ) .",
    "the intersection point of curve @xmath72 with the strait line @xmath73 corresponds to the metal - insulator transition region .",
    "the critical point separating the metallic and insulating regimes corresponds to a critical disorder with  @xmath74 .",
    "figure 4 shows also that the index @xmath65  is independent of the system size at the transition .",
    "let us now examine the conductance probability distribution for different amounts of spatial disorder . in figure 5",
    "are plotted the probability distributions of @xmath44 ( fig.5a ) and @xmath8 ( fig.5b ) for different system size ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) for the critical disorder @xmath74 .",
    "the conductance distribution seems to be neither normal nor log - normal .",
    "the size independence of the conductance distribution is in agreement with the observed one for 2d and 3d systems @xcite at the transition .",
    "the long tail of the distribution in fig.5a is representative for large fluctuations in good agreement with the results of shapiro sha1 and shapiro and cohen @xcite for the metal - insulator transition .",
    "for an infinitesimal disorder @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath78 where @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 , which is much larger than the system size @xmath6 .",
    "the conductance distribution has a gaussian form indicating the metallic regime ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this figure shows the general behaviour for this regime .",
    "once the system is away from the critical point , the conductance distribution @xmath63 begins to show size dependence .",
    "distribution @xmath63 moves toward higher values of the conductance as the system size increases .",
    "we have used the kronig - penney model in a simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) system with spatial disorder to determine the metal - insulator transition and examine the size independence of its distribution at this transition . to find the critical point ,",
    "we have used stable levy laws @xcite .",
    "we found the possibility of an anderson transition even in 1d meaning that the disorder can also provide constructive quantum interferences .",
    "we found the critical disorder @xmath81 for this transition .",
    "indeed , the results are in good agreement with the previous works in 2d and 3d systems for other models @xcite for metal - insulator transition .",
    "the conductance probability distribution is found to be gaussian in the metallic regime . at the transition",
    ", the distribution @xmath82 exhibits the typical asymmetric behaviour while in the localized regime , the distribution is log normal .",
    "it is important to study the universality of the conductance distribution at the transition in a system of finite width potentials where the conductance fluctuations are less important in comparison to the present model @xcite , and to find the critical points of the transition in the energy - disorder phase space and for different kinds of disorder .",
    "it is also important to investigate the effect of spatial disorder on conductance fluctuations in different regimes .",
