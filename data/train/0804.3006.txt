    "the ability of material particles to show wave - like interference is one of the central predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "while the early experimental tests worked with elementary particles @xcite , interferometry of atoms is by now a matured field of physics @xcite .",
    "it is in particular the ability to cool and to control atoms using laser techniques that has propelled atom interferometry into a versatile tool for precision measurements , e.g. @xcite .    as far as more complex and more massive objects are concerned",
    ", we are currently witnessing this transition from the proof - of - principle demonstration of their wave nature to the use of interferometry for quantitative measurements .",
    "specifically , the static @xcite and the dynamic @xcite bulk polarizability of fullerene molecules was measured recently with a molecule interferometer .",
    "also the controlled observation of decoherence , due to collisions with gas particles @xcite or due to the emission of thermal radiation @xcite , has been used to characterize the interaction strength ( or cross - section ) of fullerenes with external degrees of freedom .",
    "another motivation for studying interference with large molecules is to test quantum mechanics in unprecedented regimes by establishing the wave nature of ever more massive objects @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned interference experiments with large molecules are based on the near - field talbot - lau effect , where three gratings are used which serve , in turn , to produce coherence in the beam , to bring it to interference , and to resolve the fringe pattern .",
    "this is an established technique in atom and electron interferometry @xcite , and it is the method of choice for massive and bulky molecules ( such as fullerenes @xcite , meso - tetraphenylprorphyrins @xcite , or functionalized azobenzenes @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason is that a talbot - lau interferometer ( tli ) tolerates beams which are relatively weakly collimated , thus alleviating the increasing difficulty in producing brilliant beams if the particles get more complex .",
    "another important advantage compared to far - field setups , which is essential if one wants to increase the particle mass by several orders of magnitude , is the favorable scaling behavior of talbot - lau interferometers with respect to the de broglie wavelength @xcite .    as a specific feature of talbot - lau interferometers , the forces between the particles in the beam and the diffraction grating influence the interference pattern much stronger than in a far field setup .",
    "this is due to the fact that the different diffraction orders do not get spatially separated in a tli .",
    "rather , all the orders interfere among each other , producing a resonant recurrence of the pattern whenever the so - called talbot condition is met . as a consequence ,",
    "even tiny distortions of the matter wave may lead to significant changes of the fringe visibility  requiring , for example , the modification of the van der waals force due to retardation effects @xcite to be taken into account when describing the diffraction of fullerenes at gold gratings .",
    "this effect of the dispersion force between the particle and the grating wall gets more important as the mass and structure of the molecule grows .",
    "in particular , it sets increasingly strict requirements on the monochromaticity , i.e , the velocity spread permissible in the molecular beam .",
    "a very recent development , undertaken to reduce this influence , is the kapitza - dirac talbot - lau interferometer ( kdtli ) , where the second material grating is replaced by the pure phase grating produced by a standing light field @xcite .",
    "the available theoretical descriptions of molecular talbot - lau interference account for the grating forces in terms of a simple eikonal phase shift @xcite ( an expression originally derived by nuclear physicists as an asymptotic high - energy approximation to the lippmann - schwinger equation in scattering theory @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation ceases to be valid with a growing influence of the particle - grating interaction , and , due to its non - perturbative nature , its range of validity is not easy to assess . therefore , given the quest for testing quantum mechanics with ever larger particles and given the increased precision required in metrological applications , there is a clear need to extend the theoretical description of near - field matter wave interference beyond the eikonal approximation .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is therefore to develop a generalized formulation of the coherent talbot - lau effect . by combining a scattering theory formulation with semiclassical approximations",
    "we incorporate the effect of the grating interaction systematically beyond the eikonal approximation . as a prerequisite for its implementation",
    ", the established theory of near field interference first needs to be extended to account for the effects of finite angular dispersion in the molecular beam .",
    "we show how this can be done transparently by using the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics . as a by - product",
    ", this formulation permits us to quantify the adjustment precision required in realistic experiments .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec : phasespace ]",
    "we develop a generalized theory of talbot - lau interference , which is formulated independently of the particular choice of how to incorporate the grating interaction .",
    "we also establish the relation to the previous treatments by applying the eikonal approximation . in section [ sec :",
    "potential ] , we review relevant realistic descriptions of the grating interaction , and numerically illustrate their effect in the eikonal approximation .",
    "section [ sec : semiclass ] is devoted to the development of a semiclassical formalism to go beyond the elementary eikonal approximation .",
    "its predictions are numerically evaluated and compared in section [ sec : numerics ] , using the experimental parameters of the molecular interference experiments carried out in vienna @xcite .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the effect of talbot - lau interference can be described in a particularly transparent and accessible fashion by using the phase space representation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in @xcite , where both the coherent effect and the consequences of environmental interactions are formulated in terms of the wigner function of the matter wave beam . as also shown there",
    ", the analogy of the wigner function with the classical phase space distribution allows one to evaluate the predictions of classical and quantum mechanics in the same framework , a necessary step if one wants to distinguish unambiguously quantum interference from a possible classical shadow effect .    however , the treatment in @xcite is based on a number of idealizations , which must be reconsidered in view of a more refined description of the particle - grating interaction .",
    "the least problematic approximation is to disregard the motion in the direction parallel to the grating slits , which is permissible due to the translational symmetry of the setup in this direction .",
    "it follows that a two - dimensional description involving the longitudinal motion ( denoted by @xmath0 ) and the transverse motion ( denoted by @xmath1 ) of the beam is required in principle . in front of the interferometer",
    "these two degrees of freedom are well approximated by a separable state involving transverse momenta @xmath2 .",
    "if the grating interaction is treated in eikonal approximation , as done in @xcite , this implies that the transverse and the longitudinal motion remain separable throughout .",
    "one can then resort to an effectively one - dimensional description , characterized by a fixed longitudinal momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 coordinate then represents a time @xmath4 and the longitudinal propagation of the beam along @xmath0 effectively evolves the one - dimensional transverse beam state during the time @xmath5 .",
    "the finite distribution @xmath6 of the longitudinal momenta is then accounted for only in the end by averaging the results obtained with sharp values of @xmath7 .",
    "a priori , such a treatment is no longer valid for a general grating interaction where different longitudinal momentum components of the beam get correlated .",
    "we will accordingly use a two - dimensional scattering formulation to describe the grating interaction in sect .",
    "[ sec : semiclass ] .",
    "however , we will see that for the parameters of typical experiments the main effect of taking the grating interaction beyond the eikonal approximation is on the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "since the effect on the longitudinal motion is much weaker we will retain the effectively one - dimensional description outlined above , postponing the physical discussion why this is permissible to sect .",
    "[ sec : semiclass ] .",
    "another idealization found in the basic treatments of the talbot - lau effect is to assume the transverse motion in front of the interferometer to be in a completely incoherent state .",
    "this would correspond to a constant distribution of the transverse momenta @xmath8 , and for general grating transformations , which depend on @xmath8 , it is no longer a valid approximation .",
    "we will therefore present a formulation that takes into account a realistic beam profile and that allows for a general state transformation at the diffraction grating .",
    "going beyond the idealization of a perfectly incoherent state will also permit us to assess the adjustment precisions required in an experimental implementation .",
    "we start by briefly outlining how to describe matter wave interference by means of the phase space representation of quantum mechanics @xcite . as discussed above",
    ", one may restrict the dynamics to the transverse beam state , which is most generally specified by its density matrix @xmath9 .",
    "this state is equivalently described by the wigner function @xmath10 which is a function of the transverse phase space coordinates @xmath11 . like @xmath9 it depends parametrically on the longitudinal momentum @xmath7 . since we assume the beam to be collimated @xmath12 is non - zero only for @xmath2 .",
    "the great advantage of the phase space formulation is that it permits a straightforward , yet realistic , description of the beam and its propagation through the interferometer .",
    "most importantly , the free time evolution of a state during the time @xmath5 is given by the same shearing transformation as in the case of the classical phase space density,@xmath13 with @xmath14 the particle mass .",
    "on the other hand , a quantum state transformation of the form @xmath15 , such as the effect of passing a grating , reads in phase space @xmath16 here the integral kernel is given by the the propagator @xmath17 specifically , an ideal grating is characterized by a grating transmission function @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , describing the multiplicative modification of an incoming plane wave .",
    "( the factor @xmath18 is non - zero only within the slit openings of the grating and it may there imprint a complex phase to account for the interaction potential between the grating walls and the beam particle , see sect .",
    "[ sec : potential ] . ) for such gratings the transformation reads @xmath20 , so that the grating propagator reduces to a convolution kernel @xmath21 which is local in position @xcite .",
    "this choice of @xmath22 will be required below to reduce the generalized formulation of talbot - lau interference to the eikonal approximation .",
    "the convolution kernel provides a descriptive picture of the diffraction process .",
    "suppose the incoming beam is perfectly coherent , i.e. a plane wave characterized by the longitudinal momentum @xmath7 and transverse momentum @xmath23 , corresponding to the ( unnormalized ) transverse wigner function @xmath24 .",
    "the diffracted transverse state is then given by @xmath25 in case of a periodic grating with period @xmath26 , the transmission function can be decomposed into a fourier series , @xmath27 so that , after a free propagation over the longitudinal distance @xmath28 , the transverse spatial density of the beam state is given by the marginal distribution @xmath29 here , we introduced the basic _ talbot - lau coefficients _ , @xmath30 and the characteristic length scale @xmath31",
    "is called the talbot length .",
    "compare ( [ eqn : beik ] ) to the fourier coefficients of the transmission probability @xmath32 , which are given by the convolution @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : te ] ) thus implies that the density distribution takes the form of the grating transmission profile whenever the distance @xmath28 is an integer multiple of the talbot length , @xmath34 , @xmath35 this is the elementary talbot effect @xcite , and it is the backbone of the talbot - lau interferometer , which however does not require a coherent illumination .          the general setup of a talbot - lau interferometer is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlsetup ] , along with the most relevant parameters .",
    "an incoherent particle beam represented by the shaded area passes a preliminary collimation slit on the left side of the figure and enters the talbot - lau interferometer through the first grating .",
    "the angular distribution of those particles in the beam which are finally detected is characterized by the spread @xmath36 , determined by the collimation slit and the finite area of the detector .    the first grating",
    "can be understood as an array of collimation slits of period @xmath37 preparing , after a distance @xmath28 , the transverse coherence required for diffraction at the second grating . in this region ,",
    "the distortion of a matter wave front due to the grating interaction may significantly affect the interference pattern , so that the grating thickness @xmath38 enters the calculation .",
    "( it is replaced by the laser waist @xmath39 in case of a light grating . )",
    "the different diffraction orders still overlap further downstream if the distance is on the order of the talbot length @xmath40 , and they may thus interfere among each other producing a near field fringe pattern .",
    "this can be explained qualitatively from the elementary talbot effect ( [ eqn : talboteffect ] ) by considering each of the slits in the first grating as independent point sources .",
    "the talbot patterns due to the individual slits will add up constructively for appropriate choices of the grating periods @xmath37 , @xmath26 and of the distance factor @xmath41 , so that a distinct density pattern is created .",
    "it is verified without the need for a spatially resolving detector by superposing a third grating whose period @xmath42 equals that of the density pattern , and by measuring the total flux through it as a function of its transverse position @xmath43 .    we will now present a quantitative formulation of the successive propagation of the beam through the interferometer . as discussed above , one can take the longitudinal motion of the beam particles to remain unaffected by the gratings .",
    "we may therefore assume the longitudinal momentum to have a definite value @xmath7 for the time being , so that the longitudinal position @xmath0 plays the role of a time coordinate @xmath44 for the transverse motion .",
    "the transverse state of the beam entering the interferometer is far from pure .",
    "it is confined in position by the orifice of the first grating , whose size @xmath45 typically covers thousands of grating slits .",
    "the momenta @xmath8 are characterized by the angular distribution @xmath46 whose characteristic spread is denoted as @xmath36 .    in a typical experimental situation ,",
    "@xmath36 rarely exceeds @xmath47mrad corresponding to a fairly well - collimated beam",
    ". however , this still covers a range of transverse momenta that is by orders of magnitude larger than the grating momentum @xmath48 which separates the different diffraction orders .",
    "this explains why diffraction does not need to be taken into account at the first grating .",
    "the transverse wigner function merely gets modulated by the grating profile , so that behind the first grating it reads @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the transmission function which is confined to the grating orifice , in principle .",
    "however , since the size @xmath45 is typically larger than the sensitive region @xmath51 of the final detector one may equally take it to be an unconstricted periodic function .    the free propagation of the beam over the longitudinal distance @xmath28 yields @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of passing the second grating is in general described by an operator @xmath53 to be specified below .",
    "the corresponding phase space transformation is given by ( [ eqn : generalprop ] ) so that , after a second free propagation over the distance @xmath54 , the transverse beam state in front of the third grating reads @xmath55 the corresponding spatial density distribution , given by @xmath56 , is now modulated by the third grating as a function of the grating shift @xmath43 .",
    "the detection signal is thus obtained as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the spatial transmission probability of the grating and @xmath51 the size of the detector .",
    "the latter typically covers hundreds of grating periods so that one may disregard the finiteness of @xmath51 when evaluating the basic interference effect .",
    "however , as shown below , it does play a role when the experimental adjustment precision needs to be evaluated .    the resulting interference pattern is most easily characterized by the contrast of the modulation signal , conventionally defined as the ratio between the amplitude of the signal variation and its mean value . however , since the experimental signal is usually very close to a sinusoidal curve , it is in practice more convenient and more robust to use the _ sinusoidal visibility _ defined in terms of the first to the zeroth fourier expansion coefficient of the @xmath42-periodic signal @xcite,@xmath59 it can be easily obtained from noisy experimental data by fitting a sine curve and it coincides with the conventional definition in case of a sinusoidal signal .",
    "we proceed to evaluate the interference pattern ( [ eq : w3eins ] ) by noting a general property of the grating transformation @xmath53 .",
    "the periodicity of the grating implies that the position representation @xmath60 is @xmath26-periodic with respect to the center position @xmath61 .",
    "this admits the series expansion @xmath62 where the transformation within a single slit is now characterized by the corresponding fourier coefficients @xmath63 it is now convenient to specify these transformation functions in terms of their _ shifted _ fourier transformation , which serves to generalize the grating coefficients introduced for the eikonal case in ( [ eq : bj]).@xmath64 indeed , for position - diagonal operators @xmath53 , these functions drop their momentum - dependence and reduce to the coefficients in ( [ eq : bj ] ) .    the generalized grating coefficients ( [ eqn : gratingcoeff ]",
    ") can now be used to construct the generalized talbot - lau coefficients , which are the central quantities for describing the interference effect .",
    "@xmath65 we note that at integer values of the argument @xmath66 the phase factor in ( [ eqn : tlcoeff ] ) reduces to a constant sign , while @xmath8 has the meaning of an incident momentum and @xmath67 that of a scale factor , as will be seen below .    by using the generalized talbot - lau coefficients the density distribution at the third grating takes the explicit form @xmath68 this expression for the interference pattern is now further simplified by identifying the talbot - lau resonance condition .",
    "only a part of the double summation in ( [ eqn : interferencepattern1 ] ) contributes appreciably to the interference pattern .",
    "this follows from the fact that the ratio @xmath69 of grating distance to grating period is a large number , typically on the order of @xmath70 . as a result ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the phase factor in ( [ eqn : interferencepattern1 ] ) occurs on a very different scale compared to the variation of the momentum distribution @xmath71 and of the talbot - lau coefficients @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , in the idealized case of both a completely incoherent illumination and an eikonal interaction the latter two functions are independent of @xmath8 , so that the momentum integral is finite only if the phase vanishes identically , i.e. , for @xmath73 it would imply that an interference pattern is observed only if @xmath74 is a rational number .",
    "this strong resonance condition gets relaxed if we account for the weak momentum dependence of the remaining integrand in ( [ eqn : interferencepattern1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that those index pairs @xmath75 of the double sum contribute appreciably where the phase variation in the momentum integration does not exceed about @xmath76 .",
    "since the value of @xmath77 is bounded by the angular spread @xmath36 this leads to the relaxed condition @xmath78 here @xmath79 and @xmath80 are natural numbers without common divisor .",
    "they indicate the type of resonance and specify the set of index pairs @xmath81 contributing to the sum .",
    "if @xmath36 is about @xmath47mrad and @xmath82 the right hand side of ( [ eqn : tlresbound ] ) is on the order of @xmath83 , and in practice only a single resonance dominates for each set of parameters @xmath26 , @xmath37 , @xmath41 .",
    "the expression for the interference pattern thus simplifies to @xmath84 here , the period of the interference pattern is given by @xmath85 note that a large interference contrast is obtained for the low order resonances ( with small values of the integers @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) because the fourier and talbot - lau coefficients @xmath86 generically decrease with their order @xmath14 .",
    "the standard choice in experiments is to take equal gratings , @xmath87 , in an equidistant configuration , @xmath88 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath89 resonance .",
    "one may obtain even larger contrasts with @xmath88 by using the basic @xmath90 resonance , at the expense of dealing with different gratings , @xmath91 .    also magnifying or demagnifying interferometers",
    "can be realized @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the case where the first two gratings are equal , @xmath87 .",
    "the period of the interference signal is then given by @xmath92 and can not thus be greater than @xmath26 .",
    "the condition @xmath93 with @xmath94 implies that @xmath79 must be strictly greater than @xmath80 .",
    "if one wishes to decrease @xmath42 , one must choose @xmath95 which requires @xmath96 , i.e. , a compressed setup .",
    "however , the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 grow with decreasing @xmath42 so that the visibility of the resulting interference pattern decreases significantly . a magnifying interferometer , on the other hand , can only be realized with different gratings @xmath97 .    if the aim is to create a high contrast interference pattern with a specific period @xmath42 a low - order resonance should be taken , such as @xmath98 or @xmath90 .",
    "the experimental setup parameters @xmath99 must then satisfy the equations@xmath100 with desired resonance parameters @xmath101 .",
    "the solution is not unique , in general , so that one has a certain freedom to account for experimental limitations .",
    "the expression for the interference pattern can be further simplified if the grating interaction is treated in eikonal approximation .",
    "the grating coefficients ( [ eqn : gratingcoeff ] ) turn then into the momentum - independent fourier coefficients @xmath102 of the transmission function ( [ eq : bj ] ) .",
    "similarly , the generalized talbot - lau coefficients ( [ eqn : tlcoeff ] ) then reduce to the basic coefficients given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : beik ] ) so that the prediction for the density pattern ( [ eqn : interferencepattern1 ] ) simplifies to the series @xmath103 it involves the fourier transformation of the angular distribution , @xmath104 in the case of a very broad momentum distribution this characteristic function @xmath105 can be replaced by a kronecker-@xmath106 function , which yields the basic result @xcite @xmath107 the comparison with eq .",

    "this is necessary since a classical moir - type shadow pattern might give rise to a similar observation , even tough the classical contrast is typically much smaller .",
