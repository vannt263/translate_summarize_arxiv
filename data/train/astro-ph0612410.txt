    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies provide one of the strongest lines of evidence establishing the need for dark matter in the universe ( e.g. , rubin , thonnard & ford 1980 ; bosma 1981 ) . an elaborate paradigm for dark matter",
    "has subsequently developed : @xmath5cdm .",
    "more recent work emphasizes larger scale constraints ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ; spergel et al .",
    "an important question is whether this cosmic paradigm provides a satisfactory description of spiral galaxies .",
    "a complete explanation of spiral galaxies in @xmath5cdm  requires a comprehensive theory of galaxy formation .",
    "this remains lacking .",
    "indeed , there are a number of lingering problems on small ( galaxy ) scales .",
    "these include the cusp - core problem ( e.g. , de blok et al .",
    "2001a ) , the missing satellite problem ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1999a ) , the dynamical friction time scale problem ( goerdt et al .  2006",
    "; sanchez - salcedo , reyes - iturbide , & hernandez 2006 ) , and a whole suite of other incongruities and apparent contradictions that arise on the scale of individual galaxies ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; sellwood & kosowsky 2001 ) . in this paper , we will concentrate on the amplitude of the rotation velocity that is observed for spiral galaxy dark matter halos and that predicted by @xmath5cdm .",
    "considerable attention has focused on the density profile inferred for the dark matter halos of dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies at small radii ( moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ; ct et al .",

    "there are good reasons for this : lsb galaxies are dark matter dominated down to small radii , making the inference of their dark matter properties much less sensitive to the stellar mass than in higher surface brightness spirals . in the most straightforward analyses ,",
    "the data appear to contradict a basic prediction of the @xmath5cdm  structure formation scenario , that dark matter halos should have cusps at small radii ( a density distribution @xmath7 with @xmath8 : dubinski 1994 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ( hereafter nfw ) ; tormen , bouchet , & white 1997 ; moore et al.1998 , 1999b ; tissera & dominguez - tenreiro 1998 ; nusser & sheth 1998 ; syer & white 1998 ; avila - reese , firmiani , & hernandez 1998 ; salvador - ole , solanes , & manrique 1998 ; jing 2000 ; jing & suto 2000 ; kull 1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "2001 ; ricotti 2003 ; power et al .  2003 ; diemand et al .",
    "the data are apparently more consistent with a nearly constant density core ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "many different solutions to this problem have been proposed ( e.g. , el - zant , shlosman , & hoffman 2001 ; weinberg & katz 2002 ; merritt et al .  2004 ; ma & boylan - kolchin 2004 ; mashchenko , couchman , & wadsley 2006 ; tonini , lapi , & salucci 2006 ) .",
    "interesting constraints also stem from the rotation curve data for high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "it is frequently possible to obtain quite high quality data for these bright objects , but the interpretation depends critically on the mass ascribed to baryons .",
    "the stellar disks in these objects can be massive ( e.g. , debatista & sellwood 2000 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; weiner , sellwood , & williams 2001 ; zavala et al .",
    "2003 ; kassin , de jong , & weiner 2006 ) or even maximal ( e.g. , van albada & sancisi 1986 ; kent 1987 ; palunas & williams 2000 ; battaglia et al .  2006 ) .",
    "such dynamically dominant disks leave little room for halos with steep inner density profiles .",
    "for example , binney & evans ( 2001 ) find that cuspy halos are inconsistent with a number of constraints for the milky way ( cf .",
    "klypin , zhao , & somerville 2002 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it can be argued that the lack of scale length residuals in the tully - fisher relation implies that typically hsb disks are sub - maximal ( e.g. , courteau & rix 1999 ; cf .",
    "sellwood 1999 ) .",
    "if dark matter is dynamically significant in the inner regions of hsb galaxies , then it may be quite possible for the halos of these galaxies to have a steep cusp .",
    "the critical issue is the stellar mass .",
    "constraining the precise inner slope of the dark matter density profile of an individual galaxy is observationally challenging .",
    "even if the stellar mass can be properly treated , a variety of systematic effects might affect the result ( swaters et al .",
    "blok et al .  2003 ; simon et al .  2003 , 2005 ; spekkens et al .",
    "there are several distinct problems here : observational uncertainties , non - circular motions that might cause misestimation of the potential , and degeneracy between fitting parameters .",
    "observational uncertainties of concern here are those that might lead us to underestimate the steepness of the rise of the rotation curve .",
    "this might result , for example , from beam - smearing of 21 cm observations ( e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ) or mis - positioning of the slit during optical observations ( e.g. , swaters et al .",
    "such errors are not a great concern when rotation curves are observed to be steeply rising , as is typically the case for hsb galaxies in this sample .",
    "when the observed rotation curve rises more gradually , there is more potential for concern as to whether this behavior is truly intrinsic ( de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst 1997 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "this no longer appears to be a significant worry for lsb galaxies , as high resolution two dimensional velocity fields ( kuzio de naray et al .",
    "2006 ) largely confirm pervious results ( e.g. , mcgaugh , rubin , & de blok 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; see also zackrisson et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "non - circular motions can be significant at small radii , in the sense that they can represent a substantial fraction of the total gravitational potential .",
    "the contributions of circular and noncircular motions sum in quadrature . from this",
    ", it immediately follows that non - circular motions ( @xmath10 ) are only important when comparable to the rotational motion ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "simon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show some cases for which this is the case ( @xmath12 ) , albeit at quite small radii .",
    "for the sample considered here , which all have two dimensional velocity fields , @xmath10 is typically small ( a few to tens of @xmath13 ) compared to @xmath11 at the same radius ( tens to hundreds of @xmath13 ) . we consider only intermediate and large radii where @xmath14 and the contribution of non - circular motions to the potential is not significant .",
    "galaxies that do not satisfy this criterion are not in the sample .",
    "a more fundamental difficulty is the degeneracy between halo fitting parameters , even when the potential is perfectly well known .",
    "the degeneracy between stellar mass and the core radius of a pseudo - isothermal halo has long been known ( e.g. , kent 1987 ) . for nfw halos , there is substantial covariance between @xmath15 and @xmath16  even when the stellar mass is fixed ( de blok et al .",
    "this degeneracy stems from the similarity of the inner shapes of nfw halo velocity profiles over a range of ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) .",
    "more generally , degeneracy is unavoidable because of a surplus of parameters .",
    "mass models require the specification of a minimum of three parameters per galaxy ( one for the disk and two for the halo ) while empirically a single parameter suffices to describe the data ( e.g. , brada & milgrom 1999 ; mcgaugh 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt a model independent approach .",
    "we do not fit specific mass models to individual galaxies .",
    "the halo parameters derived from such models inevitably suffer from parameter degeneracies .",
    "rather , we simply ask what range of halo parameters ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) are consistent with the halo velocities implied by observation . we determine the velocity attributable to the dark matter for a broad range of stellar mass estimators .",
    "we find that the data are consistent with a nearly universal dark matter halo profile .",
    "there is some scatter about this relation , and we would not claim that there is in fact a single halo profile appropriate to all galaxies , but the data are not wildly at odds with such a situation . the slope we find is consistent with previous determinations ( e.g. , barnes , sellwood , & kosowsky 2004 ) . if halos have the nfw form , their concentrations and/or masses ( @xmath16 ) are generally smaller than might nominally be expected in @xmath5cdm .",
    "this is largely consistent with various previous results ( e.g. , debatista & sellwood 2000 ; weiner et al .",

    "the implications of the result and possible ways to reconcile the apparent discord between theory and observation are discussed in  5 .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is given in  6 .",
    "we employ the rotation curve data and mass models compiled by sanders & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) , as trimmed for quality by mcgaugh ( 2005 ) .",
    "these data originate from many independent observers , and represent the accumulated effort of a substantial community of astronomers .",
    "sample galaxies span a wide range of morphological types , from sab through all spiral types to irr / im .",
    "recent work by noordermeer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) focussing on the earliest ( s0/sa ) type disk galaxies appears contiguous with the data used here .",
    "more important than morphological type is the broad range of physical parameter space that our sample spans .",
    "it includes galaxies with circular velocities @xmath18 , baryonic masses @xmath19 , scale sizes @xmath20 kpc , central surface brightnesses @xmath21 , and gas fractions @xmath22 .",
    "no restriction is made on surface brightness or any other physical parameter .",
    "the sample represents the dynamics of disks in the broadest sense possible with available data .",
    "all sample galaxies have high quality , extended rotation curves derived from 21 cm data cubes .",
    "the high precision sample of mcgaugh ( 2005 ) consists of 60 galaxies with @xmath23 independent , resolved rotation velocity measurements , each with formal accuracy of 5% or better .",
    "we choose to exclude data with @xmath24 kpc where the controversy over cusp or core occurs ( de blok 2004 ) .",
    "the point here is to compare reliable data with the expectations of @xmath5cdm   models , free from concern over systematic uncertainties , either observational ( such as beam smearing ) or physical ( e.g. , non - circular motions ) .",
    "these may be serious concerns for constraining the innermost slope of the density profile , but do not significantly affect the data at intermediate radii . here",
    "the data are well resolved , and the observed circular velocity greatly exceeds the velocity dispersion . indeed ,",
    "strong constraints exist on the ellipticities of the potentials for some sample galaxies ( schoenmakers , franx , & de zeeuw 1997 ) .",
    "triaxiality of the halo ( e.g. , hyashi & navarro 2006 ) is not relevant to the bulk of the data here .",
    "we exclude the possibility of non - circular motions biasing the results at small radii by truncating the inner data .",
    "our result is not sensitive to the choice of the inner truncation radius .",
    "the total radial range sampled is from 1 to 74 kpc , with a median radius of 9 kpc .",
    "only a few galaxies have measured rotation extending to very large radii .",
    "the bulk of the data ( 68% ) fall in the range @xmath25 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ rhisto ] ) .",
    "data in this range are not only numerous , but fall in a range where the systematic concerns discussed above have negligible impact . the same result follows if we restrict the data to this very conservative range .",
    "for many galaxies in the sample , the contribution of the stars to the total potential can not be ignored .",
    "this dominates all other effects by far .",
    "it is necessary to subtract off the baryonic contribution to reveal the velocity due to the halo .",
    "all galaxies have detailed surface photometry from which baryonic mass models are derived .",
    "for the present work , we utilize @xmath26-band surface photometry , as this is the only band that all 60 galaxies have in common .",
    "we are working to place the sample on a uniform @xmath27-band scale , but at present lack sufficiently deep observations of some of the fainter galaxies . using the @xmath27-band data already in hand",
    "does not alter the basic result ( see also verheijen 2001 ; verheijen & sancisi 2001 ; kassin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we make no assumption about the light profile ( e.g. , exponential disk ) .",
    "the observed light distribution is converted to a baryonic rotation curve numerically ( via gipsy : van der hulst et al .",
    "this includes the bulge ( when present ) , stellar disk , and hi  gas .",
    "the molecular gas distribution is not available in most cases , but this is likely to be a small percentage of the baryonic mass in the majority of late type galaxies ( young & knezek 1989 ) .",
    "moreover , the molecular gas generally follows the stellar distribution ( helfer et al .",
    "2003 ) , so is effectively subsumed into the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "it is the estimation of stellar mass that is most crucial .",
    "the observed rotation curves provide a good map of the total gravitational potential that is due to both baryonic and dark mass . while the total potential is well constrained , dividing it into baryonic and dark mass components is a degenerate process .",
    "additional information is needed to break this degeneracy .",
    "we explore three methods for estimating the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath28 : maximum disk , @xmath29 ; stellar population synthesis models , @xmath30 ; and that from the mass discrepancy  acceleration relation , @xmath31 .",
    "this latter in effect treats mond ( milgrom 1983 ) fits ( sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) as an empirical phenomenology . that this phenomenology is present in the data",
    "is all that is required , regardless of the underlying physical reason for it ( mcgaugh 2004 ) .",
    "following mcgaugh ( 2005 ) , we can choose any arbitrary stellar mass estimate by scaling each of these prescriptions by a constant factor @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 :    @xmath35    this scheme allows us to explore the full range of possible stellar masses ( @xmath36 ) with three independent estimators for each galaxy .",
    "the population synthesis mass - to - light ratio @xmath30  is estimated from the observed @xmath37 color ( as tabulated by mcgaugh 2005 ) and the models of bell et al .",
    "( 2003b ) : @xmath38 very similar results follow from other models ( e.g. , portinari et al .",
    "the chief uncertainty of this method is the imf .",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to the nominal `` scaled salpeter '' imf adopted by bell et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , which for our purposes is nearly indistinguishable from the kroupa ( 2002 ) imf adopted by portinari et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see also portinari & sommer - larsen 2006 ) . to consider the effects of a heavier or lighter imf , we simply scale by @xmath33  ( see discussion in bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "we estimate the circular velocity provided by dark matter by subtracting the baryonic component from the observed rotation curves for each choice of @xmath28 : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the rotation velocity attributed to the dark matter , @xmath42 is the observed rotation velocity , and @xmath43 is the rotation velocity attributed to baryons .",
    "this depends on @xmath28  through @xmath44 , where @xmath45  is the rotation velocity for @xmath46 .",
    "the hi  gas component , corrected to account for helium and metals , gives @xmath47 .",
    "molecular gas generally traces the stellar distribution ( helfer et al .",
    "2003 ) and is subsumed into @xmath28 .",
    "an example rotation curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ n2403log ] .",
    "as we increase ( decrease ) @xmath28  by varying @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , the stellar contribution to the total rotation increases ( decreases ) and the corresponding contribution from the dark matter decreases ( increases ) .",
    "though the details of each realization depend on the @xmath28  estimator and the relative importance of gas ( which does not vary ) , it is a tolerable approximation to imagine the dark and baryonic lines in fig .",
    "[ n2403log ] sliding up and down see - saw fashion .    in order to restrict our attention to the best data",
    ", we have excised individual points with uncertainty in excess of 5% . in many cases ,",
    "the formal precision is rather greater than this limit .",
    "while this leaves plenty of data to analyze , various astrophysical considerations make it unrealistic to consider those data with small error bars as accurate estimates of the circular velocity of the potential ( see discussions in mcgaugh et al .",
    "2001 ; de blok et al .",
    "we therefore give uniform weight to the data which pass the 5% criterion .    a more serious uncertainty than that in the data",
    "is that in @xmath28 .",
    "the estimate of stellar mass is the single dominant source of uncertainty in this analysis .",
    "the systematic nature of this uncertainty makes it impossible to propagate it in a meaningful way .",
    "hence we simply examine the results of adopting each @xmath28  estimator , leaving it to the reader s judgement which case might seem best . fortunately , the basic result is fairly insensitive to this choice .    in fig .",
    "[ vhqboth ] we show @xmath41 for all 60 galaxies plotted together for the case of @xmath48 .",
    "remarkably , the inferred dark matter halos of all these galaxies fall more or less on top of each other .",
    "this is not to say that the dark matter halos of all galaxies are the same .",
    "quite the contrary , it is possible to observationally distinguish between the dark matter halos of individual galaxies ( sancisi 2004 ; mcgaugh 2004 ; barnes et al .  2004 ;",
    "simon et al .  2005 ) . nonetheless , when plotted together in this fashion , the apparent variation is remarkably small .",
    "taken together , the data suggest a relation @xmath49 fitting the data with @xmath48 gives @xmath50 and @xmath51 . while we would not claim that this is a universal halo that all galaxies share , it does give a tolerable approximation of the velocity attributable to dark matter .",
    "we can extend this approach to other mass - to - light values by varying @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the cases @xmath52 , @xmath39 , @xmath48 and @xmath53 ( the latter as suggested , @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath53 . ] by bottema 1993 and courteau & rix 1999 ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dmscale ] .",
    "this figure is like fig .",
    "[ vhqboth ] for the various mass estimators , but with shading to illustrate the density of data .",
    "the darker the shading , the more sharply defined the relation between @xmath17  and radius .",
    "there is some covariance between the slope @xmath55  and intercept @xmath56 .",
    "our purpose here is to constrain the amplitude of the velocity that can be attributed to dark matter . in order not to obscure the basic result with uncertainties introduced by covariance",
    ", we fix the slope to @xmath57 , consistent with our data ( see figs .  [ dmhistog1 ]  [ dmhistog04 ] ) and those of barnes et al .  (",
    "moreover , the slope does not vary appreciably when left free ; the important information is contained in the amplitude .",
    "fixing @xmath57 changes the @xmath48 best fit intercept to @xmath58 .",
    "this number encodes , in the simplest possible way , the amplitude of the dark matter velocity .",

    ", the amplitude of the velocity provided by the dark matter falls in the range @xmath1 for @xmath57 .",
    "one can also see in fig .",
    "[ scatterplot ] variation in the scatter about the mean .",
    "remarkably , the scatter is minimized for @xmath48 , the mond mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this is also the choice of @xmath28  which minimizes the scatter in the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( mcgaugh 2005 ) and , by construction , that in the mass discrepancy  acceleration relation ( mcgaugh 2004 ) .",
    "irrespective of the physics that causes it , this implies that mond is an important empirical organizing relation that is relevant even to dark matter .",
    "the scatter is larger for other mass estimators , but the basic result encapsulated by @xmath56  is the same .",
    "cosmological simulations lead to mass distributions for dark matter halos that have gravitational potentials which can be analytically approximated as @xmath62}\\right ] ,   \\label{nfwformula}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( nfw ) .",
    "the radius @xmath65 encloses a density 200 times the critical density of the universe ; @xmath16 is the circular velocity of the potential at @xmath65 .",
    "the radius @xmath65 is , crudely speaking , the virial radius in a critical density universe . for current @xmath5cdm  parameters ,",
    "the virial radius is more nearly at @xmath66 ( e.g. , eke , navarro , & steinmetz 2001 ) . more recently , navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have suggested that a density profile with a continuously running slope provides a better fit to simulated halos than the original nfw formula . from an observational perspective , these forms are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "we therefore retain the nfw formulation for its familiarity and its well quantified relation to cosmological parameters ( nfw ; mcgaugh , barker , & de blok 2003 ) .",
    "one interesting aspect of the data is that there is no clear tendency for the dark halo rotation curves to flatten out .",
    "the combination of disk plus halo is often close to flat , and as the disk contribution is declining , it is natural to associate the flat rotation velocity with the halo .",
    "this is , however , an oversimplification . in most cases , the inferred dark matter contribution to the velocity is still rising at the last measured point , and it is not clear that the observed flat velocity is truly representative of the halo .    in the context of simulated halos , the lack of a flat halo rotation velocity may help the models .",
    "nfw halos do not possess a significant range of radii where @xmath67 , as needed to produce flat rotation curves .",
    "presumably , the observed range suffices only to cover the rising portion of the halo , with a suggestion of a turn - over in only a few sufficiently extended cases .",
    "it remains an open question why the disk and halo conspire to produce nearly flat rotation curves over the range observed .",
    "it is suggestive that the fitted slope @xmath68 is that expected for the inner portion of nfw halos .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that halos are indeed nfw , and we will use this to compare the observed and predicted amplitudes @xmath56 .",
    "an important caveat is that it is not straightforward to match the radial scale of simulated halos to that of real galaxies .",
    "it is for this reason that the amplitude @xmath56  provides the most robust comparison : it uses all the data to set the velocity scale , in effect providing an integrated measure that is not sensitive to systematic effects in the way the innermost slope may be .",
    "the slope of the data is , if anything , too close to a constant @xmath57 .",
    "nfw profiles have this slope at small radii , though the exact slope the simulations predict is still debated ( e.g. , ricotti 2003 ; power et al .  2003 ; navarro et al .  2004 ; diemand et al .  2005 ) .",
    "irrespective of this detail , all simulations agree that the inner slope gradually transitions to a steeper fall off ( becoming @xmath69 at large radii ) .",
    "the consequence is that there should be some curvature apparent in @xmath41 over the radial range sampled by the data .",
    "this is not obvious in the observations ( fig .",
    "[ vhqboth ] ) .",
    "this difference between simulations and data is sufficiently large that the difference between the various proposed analytic formulas is a rather small concern .",
    "the use of individually simulated halos ( e.g. , hayashi et al .  2004 ; cf .",
    "de blok 2005 ) in preference to the analytic approximations should not make a difference to the radii of interest here , where the deviations between the various realizations of the simulation results are small .",
    "in addition to the data , the upper panel of fig .  [ vhqboth ] shows the predicted shape and amplitude of nfw rotation curves for a range of @xmath16 . presuming galaxy halos span a range of mass comparable to that suggested by their luminosities",
    ", one would not only expect more curvature than observed , but also a wider spread in @xmath17  ( compare , for example , the halos with @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "that the data concentrate in this plane more than anticipated might suggest that we may err in presuming that halo masses span the same range of mass as the observed luminosity , or that the simulated @xmath15-@xmath16  relation built into the lines in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ vhqboth ] may not be precisely correct .",
    "one must bear in mind , of course , that the data only extend over a finite range of radii , and do not generally show the inevitable maximum and decline in @xmath17 . though it is difficult to assign a specific halo to a particular galaxy , taken together the data are suggestive of an envelope composed of halos of a range of masses .",
    "if we had complete knowledge of the potentials out to arbitrary radii , we might see individual halos peeling away from this envelope as illustrated by the lines in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ vhqboth ] .    for comparison with the data , we can ask what we would expect to find from a @xmath5cdm  model observed in the same way as the data .",
    "we sample a series of halos with @xmath72 ( e.g. , the lines in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ vhqboth ] ) .",
    "model data points are allowed to fill the space available to them within the observed range of radii .",
    "the model points are uniformly sampled and weighted since we have no knowledge of the underlying halo mass distribution , other than that it gives rise to the broad observed range of luminosities and rotation velocities .",
    "since no turn - over ( @xmath73 of the halo ) is observed in the data , the maximum radius to which halos are sampled is truncated along the lower edge of the observed envelope , as defined by a line with slope 1/2 and intercept 1.33 .",
    "the result of fitting the model halos is @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the vanilla @xmath5cdm  parameters of tegmark et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for the third year",
    "wmap parameters ( spergel et al .",

    "such an effect is unlikely to be sufficiently strong ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ; gnedin & zhao 2002 ) and acts preferentially on the wrong end of the mass function .",
