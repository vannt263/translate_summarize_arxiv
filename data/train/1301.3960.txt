    "the dissipation has long been discussed as an inevitable phenomenon in most systems , and the light is a typical target in the study of such open systems . when the light is confined in a cavity consisting of mirrors or distributed bragg reflectors , discrete cavity modes",

    "this is because the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) can not be applied on the light - matter coupling , and the total number of photons and excitations is no longer conserved .",
    "then , while the number of photons inside and outside the cavity is conserved in eq .  , we should reconsider the validity of this expression carefully .    in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime , even in the ground state of the coupled ( polariton ) system",

    "as pointed out by glauber and lewenstein @xcite , such virtual photons exist even in a simple dielectric medium , and its `` squeezing '' character is different from that of the squeezed light in vacuum . whereas the electromagnetic fields are certainly sub- and super - fluctuant in dielectrics , such a `` squeezed '' quantum fluctuation recovers to the one of the coherent or vacuum state when the fields escape from the dielectrics to the vacuum . in this way , even in the ultrastrong light - matter coupling regime",
    ", the polaritons simply represent the electromagnetic fields in dielectrics , and we can not generate non - classical light outside the cavity at least in the linear optical process with classical inputs . certainly , classical outputs are obtained by classical inputs at least in the approach of quantum langevin equations @xcite .",
    "however , when we simply suppose the standard expression , we encounter a delicate but elemental problem : even if the outside is the vacuum ( bath at zero temperature ) , since the virtual photons inside the cavity can escape to the outside , the polariton system is inevitably excited @xcite .",
    "while eq .   is introduced phenomenologically in some cases , its validity can be justified based on a fundamental framework at least when the cavity is empty and its quality factor is high ( good cavity limit ) @xcite .",
