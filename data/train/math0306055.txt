    "thus , the logarithmic limit set lends itself to applications of culler  shalen theory , where essential surfaces are associated to ideal points of curves in the character variety of a 3manifold .    given a compact , orientable , irreducible 3manifold with boundary consisting of a single torus ,",
    "one calls boundary slopes of essential surfaces associated to ideal points of the character variety _ strongly detected_. it is shown in @xcite that the slope of each side of the newton polygon of the @xmath0polynomial is a strongly detected boundary slope .    in the second section ,",
    "we generalise the @xmath0polynomial to define an _",
    "eigenvalue variety _ of a manifold with boundary consisting of @xmath4 tori .",
    "we describe the _ strongly detected boundary curves _ , i.e. the boundary curves of essential surfaces associated to ideal points of the character variety , via a map from the logarithmic limit set of the eigenvalue variety to the @xmath5sphere .",

    "bergman gives the following three descriptions of a _ logarithmic limit set _ in @xcite :    \\1 .",
    "define @xmath9 as the set of limit points on @xmath10 of the set of real @xmath11tuples in the interior of @xmath12 : @xmath13    \\2 .",
    "define @xmath14 as the set of @xmath11tuples @xmath15 as @xmath16 runs over all real  valued valuations on @xmath8/j$ ] satisfying @xmath17 .",
    "define the support @xmath18 of an element @xmath19 $ ] to be the set of points @xmath20 such that @xmath21 occurs with non ",

    " zero @xmath25 , the maximum value of the dot product @xmath26 as @xmath27 runs over @xmath18 is assumed at least twice .",
    "bergman shows in @xcite that the second and third descriptions are equivalent , and it follows from bieri and groves @xcite that all descriptions are equivalent :    @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath3 for the logarithmic limit set of the variety @xmath1 . a generic picture for the projection of a variety in @xmath29 into @xmath30 and its logarithmic limit set in @xmath31",

    "the ideal generated by a set of polynomials @xmath32 shall be denoted by @xmath33 , and the variety generated by the ideal @xmath34 is denoted by @xmath35 or @xmath36 , if @xmath37 .    , width=188 ]      the third description of the logarithmic limit set can be illustrated using spherical duals of newton polytopes .",

    "the _ spherical dual _ of a bounded convex polytope @xmath53 in @xmath47 is the set of vectors @xmath54 of length @xmath55 such that the supremum @xmath56 is achieved for more than one @xmath27 , and it is denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath58 consists of all outward pointing unit normal vectors to the support planes of @xmath53 which meet @xmath53 in more than one point .",
    "if @xmath53 is the newton polytope of a non  zero polynomial @xmath22 , then the spherical dual of @xmath59 is also denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the following lemma is immediate from the third description of the logarithmic limit set :    [ log : int lem ] let @xmath1 be an algebraic variety in @xmath60 defined by the ideal @xmath7 . then @xmath3 is the intersection over all non  zero elements of @xmath7 of the spherical duals of their newton polytopes .",
    "spherical duals are easy to visualise in low dimensions . given a convex polygon @xmath53 in @xmath61 , its spherical dual is the collection of points on the unit circle defined by outward pointing unit normal vectors to edges of @xmath53 . given a convex polyhedron in @xmath62 , we obtain the vertices of its spherical dual again as points on the unit sphere @xmath63 arising from outward pointing unit normal vectors to faces .",
    "we then join two of these points along the shorter geodesic arc in @xmath63 if the corresponding faces have a common edge .",
    "this gives a finite graph in @xmath63 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    if the ideal @xmath7 is principal , defined by an element @xmath64 , then bergman states in @xcite that the set @xmath65 is precisely @xmath58 .",

    "[ log : sph lem ] let @xmath49 $ ] .",

    "a similar argument shows : @xmath90 and similarly for the @xmath91 . since @xmath92 , either @xmath93 or @xmath94 , and hence either @xmath67 or @xmath95 .",

    "logarithmic limit sets of varieties defined by a principal ideal are therefore completely determined by a generator of the ideal , and readily computable .",
    "if the ideal @xmath7 is not principal , then @xmath102 is the intersection of the spherical duals of the newton polytopes of _ finitely _ many elements in @xmath7 .",
    "this follows from bieri and groves @xcite .",
    "however , there is presently no known algorithm to determine a suitable finite set of elements of @xmath7 .",
    "conjecturally , a grbner basis may suffice .",
    "[ [ log : computing ] ]    as bergman notes , the spherical dual of the convex hull of a finite subset @xmath103 of cardinality @xmath104 is a finite union of convex spherical polytopes .",
    "it is the union over all @xmath105 of the set of @xmath54 satisfying the @xmath106 inequalities @xmath107 where @xmath27 ranges over @xmath0 .",
    "this may be useful for calculations , but it also shows that corners of the convex spherical polytopes which we consider have rational coordinate ratios , and points with rational coordinate ratios are dense in the polytope .",
    "such a polytope is called a _ rational convex spherical polytope_. we summarise further results by bergman and bieri  groves as follows :    [ bergman - bieri - groves ] the logarithmic limit set @xmath3 of an algebraic variety @xmath1 in @xmath6 is a finite union of rational convex spherical polytopes .",
    "the maximal dimension for a polytope in this union is achieved by at least one member @xmath53 in this union , and we have @xmath108      bergman asks in @xcite whether every polytope in the above union always has the same dimension . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the irreducible component in the @xmath109eigenvalue variety of the whitehead link complement @xmath110 which arises from the dehn surgery component has logarithmic limit set consisting of five components , four of which are points , and one of which is a union of geodesic arcs .",
    "a schematic picture is given in figure [ fig : whl_log_lim ] .",
    "it would be interesting to modify bergman s question and ask whether each connected component of the logarithmic limit set of an irreducible variety can always be expressed as a union of polytopes all having the same dimension when @xmath111 .",
    ", width=188 ]      we conclude this section with a lemma , which is useful for applications of culler  shalen theory .",
    "[ curve finding lemma ] let @xmath1 be an algebraic variety in @xmath6 , and @xmath112 be a point with rational coordinate ratios .",
    "then there is a curve @xmath113 , i.e. an irreducible subvariety of complex dimension one , in @xmath1 such that @xmath114 .    by a lemma of bergman ( @xcite , p.464 ) , the point @xmath54 is contained in the logarithmic limit set of an irreducible component of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we may assume that @xmath1 is irreducible for the purpose of this proof .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is defined by the ideal @xmath34 in @xmath115 = \\c[x_1^{\\pm 1},\\ldots , x_m^{\\pm 1}]$ ] .",
