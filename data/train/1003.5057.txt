    "inflation solved the various cosmological problems like horizon , homogeneity , flatness problem , just by assuming that the potential energy of scalar fields dominates the expansion of the universe .",
    "moreover , inflation scenario naturally explains the origin of the almost scale invariant density perturbation .",
    "the observations in the past decades verified many of the predictions of inflation .",
    "almost scale invariant spectrum is now confirmed and now we even know that the violation of the exact scale invariance is 4% level  @xcite , which is also consistent with the simplest slow roll inflation scenario .",
    "the amplitude of quantum fluctuation of inflaton @xmath1 during slow - roll inflation is determined by the unique relevant mass scale at that time , e.g. the hubble rate @xmath2 : @xmath3 however , on scales as large as the horizon radius the meaning of the amplitude of field perturbation becomes subtle because it depends on the choice of gauge . for the flat slicing gauge , in which the trace of the spatial curvature is kept unperturbed ,",
    "the perturbation equation for a scalar field becomes very simple and looks very similar to the one without gravitational perturbation  @xcite .",
    "therefore the amplitude mentioned above can be in fact understood as that in the flat slicing gauge .",
    "this amplitude of perturbation can be interpreted as the dimensionless curvature perturbation on a uniform energy density surface @xmath4 .",
    "transformation law is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the shift in time coordinate for this transformation , which is given by @xmath7 using the time derivative of the background scalar field .",
    "writing the perturbation amplitude in terms of @xmath4 is useful because the curvature perturbation does not evolve on super - horizon scales when the evolution path of the universe is unique .",
    "this constancy of @xmath4 simplifies the analysis of density perturbation during inflation for a single inflaton model .",
    "an extension of this argument to the case of multi - component inflaton is the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite , as we explain below .",
    "further detailed comparison between the theoretical predictions and future observations is awaited .",
    "one important observation will be tensor - type perturbation in cosmic microwave background .",
    "tensor - type perturbation is the transverse - traceless part of the spatial metric perturbation , which is generated by the same mechanism as the perturbation of the inflaton field .",
    "gravitational action has a overall prefactor @xmath8 , and hence we define the canonically normalised metric perturbation @xmath9 so as to absorb this factor from the quadratic action .",
    "then , the quadratic action for the transverse traceless part of @xmath10 becomes identical to the one for a massless scalar field .",
    "therefore the amplitude of perturbation @xmath10 generated through almost de sitter inflation is also @xmath11 .",
    "using this relation , we have @xmath12 thus we find that the cmb temperature fluctuation caused by the tensor perturbation directly probes the value of @xmath2 during inflation , i.e. the energy scale of inflation .",
    "this can be discriminated from the scalar - type perturbation by looking at b - mode polarisation  @xcite .",
    "another important observation is the non - gaussianity of the temperature fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the non - gaussianity is caused by the non - linear dynamics of cosmological perturbation .",
    "once we have completely understood the evolution of density perturbation at late time , the remaining non - gaussianity which is not accounted for should have their origin in the earlier universe .",
    "the results of wmap 7 years indicate that the local - type non - gaussianity parameter is given as @xmath13 at 68% confidence level  @xcite . for the planck satellite",
    ", it is expected that the window of @xmath14 is expected to be reduced to @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "recently , non - gaussianity of the primordial perturbation also has been studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the main reason for non - gaussianity to attract much attention is the expectation to future observations mentioned above .",
    "these observations may bring us valuable information about the dynamics of inflation . here in this short paper",
    ", we would like to clarify the difficulties in generating large non - gaussianity from the non - linear dynamics during inflation .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity gives rise as non - trivial higher order correlation functions in primordial perturbations . in principle , various types of non - gaussianity are possibly generated  @xcite , but here we focus on the so - called local - type non - gaussianity .",
    "local - type non - gaussianity is characterised by the existence of one - to - one local map between the physical curvature perturbation @xmath16 and the variable which follows the gaussian statistics @xmath17 at respective spatial points .",
    "namely , we can expand the curvature perturbation as @xmath18 and the gaussian variable @xmath19 satisfies ordinary gaussian statistics : @xmath20    in this case three point function can be characterised by a single non - linear parameter @xmath21  @xcite as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , other types of non - gaussianity can be generated .",
    "however , when we focus on super - horizon dynamics , only local - type non - gaussianity can be produced as is explained below .",
    "formalism.,width=302 ]      here we just present an intuitive explanation about how the density perturbations evolve when the length scale is much larger than the hubble scale .",
    "super - horizon dynamics is locally described by the friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "we consider the evolution of the universe starting with an initial flat hypersurface at @xmath24 , on which the initial values of the inflaton field have a certain distribution .",
    "we evolve the spacetime until reaching the final surface at @xmath25 that is characterised by a specified energy density as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "hence , the final surface is a uniform energy density surface by definition .",
    "as each horizon patch is causally disconnected from the others in the inflating universe , its evolution is determined as a local process .",
    "if initial conditions are completely given in each horizon patch , we can solve the evolution of its future . here , for simplicity , we assume that the evolution of the averaged values of fields in each horizon patch is determined by the averaged values of initial data .",
    "this assumption is not necessarily true in general , but we have a good reason to assume so in most cases .",
    "initial conditions for the smaller scale perturbations can affect the evolution of the averaged values of variables . however , as there are so many small scale degrees of freedom , the average of their effects will not be largely fluctuated except for rare situations .",
    "of course , even if we can neglect the effect of fluctuations on small scales , this does not mean that the backreaction due to small scale degrees of freedom does not modify the dynamics of the averaged values of variables .",
    "this backreaction effect arises at the second order perturbation or higher .",
    "therefore the difference in the backreaction effect between different horizon patches is even higher order in perturbation .",
    "thus , we usually neglect this effect for simplicity . of course , in the situation like preheating the sub - horizon scale perturbations evolve more rapidly than the averaged values , we definitely need to take the backreaction into account .",
    "however , even in that case , it will not be necessary to know all the details of small scale perturbations to understand the evolution of the averaged variables .",
    "anyway , we neglect these effects originating from small scale perturbations here",
    ". then , the e - folding number between the initial surface and the final one is completely determined by the initial averaged values of the variables . in the scalar field dominant universe , such initial conditions are specified by the values of the field components and their time derivatives , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we denote @xmath26 together with @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "then , the e - folding number between the initial surface and the final one , @xmath29 is given as a function of @xmath28 . then , roughly speaking , the spatial metric on the final uniform energy density surface will be given by @xmath30 the curvature perturbation is in fact the perturbation in the above exponent @xmath31 , and hence we have @xmath32 this formula is the heart of the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite .",
    "in the slow roll case , the evolution equation for the scalar field can be approximated by a first order differential equation in @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the phase space of the initial conditions @xmath28 is reduced to @xmath26 . in this case , if there is only a single component , the trajectory in the field configuration space , which is one dimensional , is necessarily unique .",
    "then , @xmath34 does not depend on the choice of the energy density of the final surface .",
    "it can be set to a representative background value at the initial time .",
    "namely , @xmath35 therefore nothing non - trivial happens during the super - horizon evolution for slow - roll single field inflation .",
    "even if the slow - roll conditions are violated , single field inflation does not produce sizable @xmath0 for modes far beyond the horizon scale .",
    "this is because the trajectories in the configuration space continues to converge as the decaying perturbation mode gets irrelevant .",
    "in order to generate non - gaussianity through the evolution on super horizon scales , it is therefore essential to consider multi - component inflaton field .    using the formula ( [ zetadeltan ] )",
    ", we can express the curvature perturbations on the final surface in terms of the field perturbations on the initial surface as @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 indicates the quantities evaluated at @xmath38 , and the subscript @xmath39 associated with @xmath40 means the differentiation with respect to @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the background trajectory . with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ zetaexp ] ) , we can write the three point correlation function of @xmath4 at @xmath25 as @xmath44+\\cdots . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term contains only three @xmath45s .",
    "if the initial fluctuations at @xmath24 are gaussian , this term vanishes .",
    "depending on the model of inflation , early generation of non - gaussianity at around horizon crossing is possible  @xcite .",
    "however , the observed almost scale invariant and slightly red spectrum of initial curvature perturbation strongly suggests that the inflation is likely to have been in the slow roll regime at around the horizon crossing . for the slow roll inflation",
    ", it is shown that the early production of non - gaussianity is strongly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is well motivated to consider non - gaussianity contained in the second term ( or even higher order terms ) , generated by the non - linear evolution after the horizon crossing .",
    "generation of non - gaussianity can be classified into two classes .",
    "one is generation through the super horizon evolution during inflation .",
    "the other is generation at the end of or after inflation  @xcite . in either case",
    "the non - gaussianity is of local type .",
    "three point correlation function is characterised by one parameter @xmath21 alone , and it is related to the e - folding number @xmath46 as @xmath47 neglecting higher order terms .",
    "there are various models of inflation that produces large non - gaussianity of local type at the end of or after inflation . here",
    "we briefly mention curvaton type model  @xcite as a typical example to explain the mechanism to generate large non - gaussianity .",
    "curvaton is another scalar field that is introduced to explain the origin of primordial curvature perturbation . during inflation ,",
    "curvaton field is almost massless but it starts to behave as a massive field later when the hubble rate decays down to the mass scale of the curvaton field .",
    "then , the curvaton starts to oscillate around the minimum of the potential and eventually decays into radiation . at this point ,",
    "the fluctuations in the curvaton @xmath48 are transferred into curvature perturbations . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case that the density perturbations are dominated by the fluctuations originating from the curvaton .",
    "neglecting a contribution of second order of @xmath49 to @xmath4 , which turns out to yield only @xmath50 , we have  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fraction of the energy density that the decay products of @xmath48 takes . here",
    ", we used the estimate @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the mass of the curvaton .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum is observationally fixed as @xmath55 ^ 2\\right)=o ( 10^{-10}).\\ ] ] therefore , if @xmath56 is not small , @xmath57 can be as small as @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - linear parameter is given by @xmath59 which can be as large as @xmath60 . in this way ,",
    "the production of large non - gaussianity at the end of inflation is rather easily achieved .    as a mechanism for getting large non - gaussianity",
    ", one can also consider generation of perturbations during preheating phase  @xcite.in this case , the background evolution is strongly coupled to the evolution of small scale fluctuations because the e - folding number changes depending on how fast the energy of coherent oscillation of fields decays into the small scale perturbations .",
    "while in the other models the transmutation of homogeneous isocurvature perturbations on each hubble patch into adiabatic perturbations is determined just by solving the background evolution of various homogeneous and isotropic universe models . in this sense the mechanism to generate density perturbation during preheating stage is quite different from the other models .",
    "here we just present the formula for @xmath21 in slow - roll inflation with canonical kinetic term . a systematic derivation for more general formula , including higher order correlators , is given in ref .",
    "assuming that the initial perturbations of fields are gaussian in the following form @xmath61 the formula for @xmath21 is written in terms of the potential of the scalar field @xmath62 as @xmath63 here , we neglected non - gaussianity in the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 . to define @xmath66 and @xmath67 , it is convenient to introduce the propagator @xmath68{}^i_j , \\label{tproduct}\\ ] ] where @xmath69_{\\phi=\\bar\\phi(n)},\\ ] ] is the potential term that appears in the linear perturbation equation when we use the e - folding number @xmath40 as a time coordinate .",
    "the indices associated with @xmath62 represent differentiation with respect to scalar field .",
    "@xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ tproduct ] ) means that the matrices @xmath71 are ordered in time when the exponential is expanded in power of @xmath71 . using this propagator , @xmath66 and @xmath67",

    "@xmath76 satisfies the same equation as @xmath64 @xmath77 and the boundary condition is given by @xmath78 , where the index is raised by the inverse of the field space metric , which is assumed to be @xmath79 here .",
    "the three point interaction @xmath80 is given by @xmath81_{\\phi=\\bar\\phi(n)}.\\ ] ] in a naive sense , slow - roll conditions require that the potential of the inflaton is a smooth function of @xmath82 . hence higher order differentiations with respect to @xmath82 are suppressed .",
    "more precisely , introducing a slow - roll parameter @xmath83 where @xmath84 is set to unity , @xmath71 and @xmath80 are supposed to be of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . to obtain an almost scale - invariant spectrum , assuming this kind of scaling is natural although it is not strictly required  @xcite .",
    "in general , there might be a very massive isocurvature degree of freedom , which does not satisfy the above simple scaling .",
    "however , in this simple example , fluctuations in such a massive degree of freedom decay rapidly , and hence they can be safely neglected .",
    "duration of the inflation is roughly estimated as @xmath87 hence , the exponent in the propagator @xmath88 is estimated to be @xmath89 . as it is the exponent , it is crucial whether the amplitude of this factor is slightly bigger or smaller than unity . in principle",
    ", therefore @xmath88 itself can be much larger or much smaller than unity .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath66 and @xmath90 depend on the behaviour of the propagator , but the value of @xmath66 at @xmath65 is given by definition so as to satisfy @xmath91",
    "expanding this equation up to first order , we obtain @xmath92 if @xmath88 stays of @xmath89 , one can say that @xmath66 and @xmath90 also stay @xmath93 . substituting these estimates into eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) , we find that @xmath94 as the general argument as given in refs .",
    "@xcite tells .",
    "however , if amplitude of @xmath88 largely deviates from unity , @xmath66 and hence @xmath67 are also largely enhanced or suppressed , resulting in large enhancement or suppression of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) .",
    "then , the order of magnitude of @xmath21 is not necessarily suppressed like @xmath85 . furthermore , slow roll conditions are violated , we have more chance to generate large non - gaussianity . however , it is not so easy to construct a viable model which generates large non - gaussianity from the super - horizon dynamics during inflation as we shall see below .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ]      first we consider double inflation model  @xcite , which is a simple two - field model . the potential is given by @xmath95 there is no direct coupling between two fields , @xmath1 and @xmath96 , except for gravitational one .    here",
    "we follow the analysis of ref .",
    "we show the background trajectory for @xmath97 in fig .  2 taken from the same reference .",
    "since the mass of @xmath96-field is much larger , the field moves rapidly in @xmath96-direction first .",
    "arriving at around the minimum in @xmath96-direction , the slow roll conditions are violated and the field oscillates several times .",
    "this violation of slow - roll conditions at the intermediate step is possible when the mass ratio is large enough .",
    "otherwise , the trajectory becomes just a smooth curve and slow roll conditions are not violated in the middle .",
    "one may expect that this temporal violation of slow roll produces large non - gaussianity .",
    "however , this is not the case .    during the period when @xmath96-field is moving rapidly ,",
    "@xmath1-field stays almost constant because the mass of @xmath1-field is small compared with the hubble rate which is dominantly determined by the term @xmath98 in the potential .",
    "hence , the total e - folding number is simply given by the sum of e - foldings for two stages of inflation : @xmath99 applying the formula ( [ fnlformula ] ) , we find @xmath100 hence , as in the usual slow - roll case , the non - gaussianity is suppressed by the slow - roll parameter @xmath101 .      as a second example , let s consider hybrid inflation model  @xcite whose potential is given by @xmath102 usually @xmath1 is the inflaton field and @xmath96 stays at @xmath103 during inflation .",

    "if the fluctuations of @xmath1-field also contribute , which is usually required in order to produce almost scale invariant spectrum , the value of @xmath21 becomes even smaller .",
    "furthermore , a more stringent constraint can be set by considering the following condition .",
    "if @xmath115 is not satisfied , fluctuations at the horizon scale modes at that time determine on which side the field rolls down .",
    "then , the tachyonic instability does not keep the coherence of @xmath96-field on the super horizon scales , leading to the so - called spinodal decomposition . as a result ,",
    "long wavelength fluctuation is , roughly speaking , completely erased .",
    "hence , there is no chance to generate large non - gaussianity originating from the fluctuation of @xmath96-field .",

    "as @xmath125 is also required , we conclude that @xmath21 can not be much larger than unity .",
    "in the preceding subsection we have observed that large mass scale for the isocurvature modes is necessary to generate large non - gaussianity .",
    "however , the mass squared should not be large positive at the early stage of inflation when the interesting scales exit the horizon .",
    "this requirement is not easily compromised unless we invent a very artificial form of potential just to produce large non - gaussianity .    here",

    "we focus on the trajectories which pass near the saddle point as shown in the same figure with a red curve . in this model mass",
    "squared in the @xmath96-direction is negative from the beginning .",

    ", the fluctuation in @xmath96-direction is enhanced by the ratio of @xmath1 compared with its initial value . after the direction of trajectory changes , this fluctuation in @xmath96-direction",
    "is transferred to the curvature perturbation . in this way",

    "should last long .",

    ", the amplitude of curvature perturbation originating from the fluctuation in @xmath1 direction dominates . for inflation to last long near the saddle point",
    ", the trajectory should pass very close to the saddle point .",
    "however , in such cases significant fraction of the universe will fall into the other side of the saddle point . as a result domain walls",
    "are formed , which leads to the problematic domain wall dominated universe .    even if we can avoid the domain wall formation ( by considering models with higher symmetry ) , it is not easy to construct models which explain the naturalness of such a special trajectory .",

    "we claimed it difficult to construct a natural model in which large non - gaussianity originating from the non - linear evolution is produced before inflation terminates . by contrast , generation of large non - gaussianity at the end of or after inflation is rather easy .",
    "however , it may not be so trivial in general to identify when non - guassianity is generated .",
    "we gave an example of double inflation in ",
    "[ doubleinf ] . although we did not mention it in the text , in this model the non - linear parameter @xmath21 as a function of @xmath141 becomes very large temporally when the background trajectory changes its direction , but",
    "this large @xmath21 does not persist long .",
    "this means that the time dependence of @xmath21 is not always appropriate to read when non - gaussianity is mainly generated .",
    "another important point to note is the limitation of neglecting small scale perturbations .",
    "the small scale perturbations often become important for the field components that become massive during inflation .",
    "a typical example is the hybrid inflation model discussed in   [ hybrid ] . to take into account the effect of small scale perturbations , @xmath0 formalism based on the background evolution for spatially homogeneous spacetime",
    "is not sufficient .",
    "we need to extend @xmath0 formalism incorporating collective variables that characterise statistical state such as the averaged magnitude of small scale fluctuation .",

    "<S> we discuss generation of non - gaussianity in density perturbation through the super - horizon evolution during inflation by using the so - called @xmath0 formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we first provide a general formula for the non - linearity parameter generated during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is proportional to the slow - roll parameters , multiplied by the model dependent factors that may enhance the non - gaussianity to the observable ranges . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss three typical examples to illustrate how difficult to generate sizable non - gaussianity through the super - horizon evolution during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> first example is the double inflation model , which shows that temporal violation of slow roll conditions is not enough for the generation of non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> second example is the ordinary hybrid inflation model , which illustrates the importance of taking into account perturbations on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss kadota - stewart model . </S>",
    "<S> this model gives an example in which we have to choose rather unnatural initial conditions even if large non - gaussianity can be generated . </S>"
