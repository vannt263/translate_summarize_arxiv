    "recently non - equilibrium dynamics of cold atom systems has been enthusiastically targeted , because cold atom systems are ideal as isolated quantum systems configured in laboratory , whose parameters can be modified dynamically @xcite . in cold atom systems , strength and sign of interaction between atoms",
    "can be adapted by use of feshbach resonance @xcite , and also the lattice potentials can be composed using optical lattices .",
    "the dynamics of quantum quench @xcite has been explored by suddenly changing the trap potential and the interaction , and also theoretically this dynamics has been studied @xcite .",
    "however , dynamics induced by a gradual change of parameters in real time has a lot more to be investigated .",
    "these dynamics are completely different from the quantum quench dynamics , because the constant change of the system parameters in time continuously causes the energy excitation and dissipation in the systems . in other words ,",
    "these systems are not expected to relax to an equilibrium state , but they or their subsystems may reach a steady state ; one of the goals of this work is to investigate a relaxation not to an equilibrium state but to a steady state of the whole system or only a subsystem , due to the time - dependent hamiltonian .    of these dynamics , especially we focus on drag dynamics of a fermion cluster trapped by a moving trap in a fermion cloud , interacting with cluster particles by contact interaction .",
    "drag dynamics is one of the basic concepts of dynamics ; for example , recently spin drag dynamics has been studied @xcite in different situations .",
    "our study aims at a detailed investigation of typical many - body drag dynamics , which is essential to the understanding of the non - equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems .",
    "also , this study observes the steady state of the moving cluster in the background of the fermion cloud ; for example , when the cluster reaches its steady state , the total energy increases linearly in time because the cluster is driven at a constant speed against the cloud , which means that our system as a whole is not in a steady state .",
    "thus in this study we simulate the cluster drag dynamics in one - dimensional two - component fermi systems with contact interaction . in this system ,",
    "a cluster of fermions is forced to move by a species - dependent trap at a constant speed , interacting with a cloud of the other type of fermions by contact interaction .",
    "we calculate the energy of the whole system as a function of time , and evaluate the energy increase per unit time by a linear fit .",
    "the reason is that the total energy increase is closely related to the energy increase in the cloud , which is observable experimentally by measuring the momentum distribution of the cloud , since when the cluster reaches a steady state , the cloud energy increase per time equals the total energy increase per time .",
    "then we compare the simulation result with a semiclassical mean - field result to clarify whether and how this dynamics is explained by a semiclassical theory . as a result , the characteristic peak structure in the profile of the energy increase per unit time can not be explained by the semiclassical theory ; internal degrees of freedom of the cluster are indispensable for the calculation in the high cloud density region .",
    "our simulation is limited to one - dimensional systems , but high - dimensional versions of our system could be calculated or explored experimentally . especially in cold atom systems ,",
    "contact interaction between two species is realized ( in this case there is no intra - species interaction because of the fermi statistics ) , and also some kinds of spin - dependent potentials are possible .",
    "our study could give some intuition for the investigation of such kind of drag dynamics in high dimensions .",
    "we simulate drag dynamics , and calculate the energy of the whole system in one - dimensional two - component fermi systems .",
    "initially a cluster of @xmath0 fermions is trapped by a harmonic potential within a cloud of the other type of free fermions ( fig.[trap](a ) ) , where the average fermion density of the cloud is @xmath1 ( the fermi momentum is @xmath2 ) .",
    "the mass of a cloud fermion , which we call a background fermion below , is @xmath3 , and the mass of a cluster fermion is @xmath4 ; the mass ratio is @xmath5 .",
    "the harmonic trap potential is set as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the displacement from the trap center .",
    "therefore in the @xmath8 case , the frequency of the harmonic trap is @xmath9 ( and the oscillation cycle is @xmath10 ) , and the typical width of the particle density distribution of a cluster fermion is @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction exists only between two fermions of the different types , and it is contact interaction which is expressed as @xmath12 , in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the location of the two interacting fermions .    .",
    "( b ) final particle density and trap potential at @xmath15 . ]    the trap moves within the region @xmath16 , and the whole system size is @xmath17 ; we approximate the infinite - size system by the large - size system .",
    "in fact , if we change the system size to @xmath18 , an extrapolation shows that energy increase per unit time ( see sec .",
    "iii ) is changed by 7% at @xmath19 , 21% at @xmath20 , and 6% at @xmath21 , when the particle number of the cluster is @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the effect of the finite system size is discussed in sec .",
    "we set the hard - wall boundary conditions .",
    "the initial trap center is @xmath24 and finally moves to @xmath25 . in this paper , we use @xmath26 and @xmath27 as the units of the system , and units of other dimensions are expressed as products of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; for example the unit of energy is @xmath29 and the unit of power is @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the independent variables in the system are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is a trap speed as mentioned below .",
    "we perform calculations for conditions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 to obtain numerically exact results .    at @xmath36",
    "we suddenly move the trap potential by a constant speed @xmath33 .",
    "although this condition seems to be enough for the cluster to get the final speed @xmath33 , the acceleration takes a little time . for faster convergence to a steady state , simultaneously we give a speed @xmath33 to the fermion cluster .",
    "then the cluster pushes the background fermions as shown in fig.[trap](b ) , while it is forced to move by the moving trap potential .",
    "the moving trap increases the total energy of the system @xmath37 , where we set @xmath38 ( just after @xmath33 is given to the cluster ) , as a linear function of the time approximately .",
    "finally the trap reaches @xmath25 in @xmath39 , and then we finish the simulation .",
    "fig.[trap](b ) shows that the background fermions have been pushed in the positive direction .",
    "later , we plot the system energy @xmath37 as a function of time , and thus we obtain @xmath40 , the energy increase per unit time , by a linear fit of that plot .",
    "we discretize the system to adopt the one - dimensional fermi  hubbard model , and apply the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) method @xcite to simulate the dynamics .",
    "we take 399 sites numbered @xmath41 at regular intervals ; the site @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the initial ( final ) location of the potential center for the fermion cluster .",
    "the lattice constant is @xmath44 , which is small enough so that the system can be treated as a continuous system : if we change the lattice constant into a half one , and at the same time we change the time step to preserve @xmath45 $ ] , the results are changed by 0.3% at @xmath46 and 4% at @xmath47 .",
    "the value of the trap potential at site @xmath48 is @xmath49 the discretized hamiltonian is @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) annihilates a fermion of the cluster ( background ) on site @xmath48 , and @xmath53 .",
    "we prepare the ground state of the system at @xmath54 by dmrg calculation , in which the 6 - 7 sweeps are needed for the ground state to converge .",
    "next we give the constant speed @xmath33 to the cluster particles as an initial state ; starting from this state , we calculate the time evolution by that hamiltonian with t - dmrg up to @xmath55 .",
    "the time step is @xmath56 and the maximum discarded eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix is below @xmath57 . in this system",
    "we apply the  usual \" second - order suzuki - trotter approach in spite of the time - dependent hamiltonian , and we estimate the errors as about 1% , changing the time step to twice or half one . the simulation is conducted in the following range of parameters : the fermion number of the cluster @xmath34 , the background fermion density ( or cloud density ) @xmath58 , the trap speed @xmath59 , the mass ratio @xmath60 1 or 2 , and the contact interaction strength @xmath61 or @xmath62 ( these values of @xmath32 are comparably large so that the reflection is dominant in typical collision cases ) .",
    "figure [ result_e_t_result_p_v](a ) shows the time dependence of the total energy obtained by the dmrg simulation for various values of the cloud density @xmath1 . the figure implies the linear increase in the system energy @xmath63 with an oscillation whose cycle is about @xmath27 : the oscillation is expected to come from the motion in the trap .",
    "the oscillation is approximated by a exponentially dumped oscillation ; the exponential decay constants for the 4 cases in fig.[result_e_t_result_p_v](a ) are evaluated at about 0 ( no convergence during the simulation time ) , 0.23@xmath64 , 0.10@xmath64 , and 0.27@xmath64 respectively .",
    "this fact suggests that , in these three cases , the cluster loses the effect of the initial conditions .",
    "therefore we evaluate @xmath40 , the energy increase per unit time , by a linear fit of this plot neglecting the oscillation , so that we extract the asymptotic behavior in the longer period of time : the linear fit is conducted over one or two cycles of internal motions in the trap ( @xmath65 fit in the region @xmath66 for @xmath8 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 ) . in other words ,",
    "@xmath40 , which corresponds to the power of the trap motion , is expected to give approximate information of the steady state of the cluster .",
    "the resistance force @xmath69 against the trap is calculated by the relation @xmath70 ; @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath69 when the trap speed @xmath33 is fixed .     at @xmath71 for the 4 cases : @xmath72 , @xmath20 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "( b ) trap speed dependence of total energy increase per unit time @xmath40 at @xmath75 ( log scale ) . ]",
    "the errors of @xmath40 come from the dmrg simulation ( @xmath76 ) , the linear - fit , the discretization effect ( @xmath77 ) , and the finite size effect . here",
    "the errors of the linear fit are of the same order as those of the dmrg simulation .",
    "this is because the linear fit errors mainly come from the dumped oscillation ( comparably weak during a cycle ) and from the uncertainty of the oscillation cycle , which is assumed as @xmath27 for @xmath8 and @xmath78 for @xmath68 , and in our system , the oscillation amplitude is of the same or smaller order than the one - cycle difference of the energy .    in our system ,",
    "the finite size effect is dominant and it determines the order of the total errors . the finite size effect is shown in fig.[syssize ] , where the site number is changed so that the lattice constant is fixed to @xmath79 . the system size dependence is extrapolated by quadratic functions of @xmath80 .",
    "the finite size effect is estimated to be @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the extrapolated data in the limit of @xmath83 .",
    "the ratio is 7% at @xmath19 , 21% at @xmath20 , and 6% at @xmath21 ; thus the finite size effect is of the order of 20% or smaller .",
    "therefore the total errors of the slope @xmath40 are estimated to be about 20% .     as a function of the inverse of the system size @xmath80 at @xmath84 .",
    "]      we focus on the dependence of the value of @xmath40 on the simulation parameters in the following . to see the velocity dependence of @xmath40 , we plot @xmath40 against @xmath33 in the case of @xmath85 in fig.[result_e_t_result_p_v](b ) .",
    "the figure demonstrates the relation @xmath86 , so that the reaction force to the trap is proportional to @xmath87 ; this suggests the existence of the inertial resistance .",
    "the inertial resistance is physically expected , because this system is one - dimensional and a cluster particle gives its momentum to a background fermion in a single collision , whose rate is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "then , we show the interaction dependence of @xmath40 in fig.[result_p_u ] at @xmath88 .",
    "this figure indicates that @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath89 in the small @xmath32 region , but seems to be saturated in the limit of @xmath90 : even if @xmath32 is infinite , @xmath40 remains finite because infinite @xmath32 corresponds to a moving hard wall .",
    "although we can not explain the exponent , the interaction strength has little effect on other than the peak height at @xmath91 as discussed below . in our simulation , we do not use attractive interaction to avoid any possibility of initial bound state , but we believe that the sign of the interaction has no effect on @xmath40 if there is no initial bound state , because the sign inversion of the interaction only changes the phase sign of scattered wavefunctions in scattering processes , and then makes no change in observables .     versus interaction strength",
    "@xmath32 at @xmath8 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . ]     as a function of cloud density @xmath1 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 at @xmath8 and @xmath94 .",
    "( a ) is @xmath97 case , and ( b ) is @xmath98 case . ]",
    "next we investigate how @xmath40 depends on the cloud density and the number of the cluster particles .",
    "figures [ result_p_d_r1](a ) and ( b ) show the energy increase per unit time @xmath40 for @xmath99 in the cases of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "in the figures , @xmath1 goes to zero exponentially in large @xmath1 ; no resistivity is observed in this region .",
    "also , the figures exhibit a single - peak structure for the cases of @xmath100 or @xmath101 , and a double - peak structure for the cases of @xmath102 . in the large @xmath1 region ,",
    "the decay curves of @xmath103 have very similar shapes at regular intervals , and the distance between the neighbors is about @xmath104 ( i.e. , the values of @xmath105 when @xmath40 is @xmath106 after the second peaks in fig.[result_p_d_r1](a ) are 0.93 at @xmath107 , 1.05 at @xmath92 , 1.15 at @xmath108 and 1.24 at @xmath109 ) .",
    "this suggests that the second peaks are at regular intervals of about @xmath110 .",
    "these characteristics does not strongly depend on interaction strength @xmath32 .",
    "the important result obtained from the figures [ result_p_d_r1](a ) and ( b ) is that @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) holds for small ( large )",
    "@xmath1 , where @xmath113 is @xmath40 at @xmath100 . in other words , if one wants to reduce the energy increase in moving @xmath0 fermions in a fermion background , one should trap the fermions in a single trap in the small @xmath1 case , but in @xmath0 traps independently in the large @xmath1 case ; this is a criterion of ways for energy saving in diffusive transport in a fermion background . in the following we mainly focus on the peak structure , especially the peak location",
    ".     as a function of cloud density @xmath1 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 at @xmath68 and @xmath94 .",
    "( a ) is @xmath97 case , and ( b ) is @xmath98 case . ]",
    "let us now explore the dependence of @xmath40 on the mass ratio @xmath31 .",
    "figures [ result_p_d_r2](a ) and ( b ) show @xmath40 in the same parameters as in fig.[result_p_d_r1 ] , except for @xmath68 . except that the height of the second peak differs between different values of @xmath0",
    ", these plots have the same features as in fig.[result_p_d_r1 ] . to extract the locations of the second peaks , we interpolate the data close to the second peak as a quadratic curve , and obtain the average distance @xmath110 ( i.e. , the estimated values of @xmath105 at the peak in fig.[result_p_d_r2](a ) are 0.86 at @xmath107 , 0.98 at @xmath92 , 1.09 at @xmath108 and 1.20 at @xmath109 ) ; the distance between the neighboring second peaks has values similar to the @xmath8 case .",
    "here we examine the energy of the cluster , the expectation value of the cluster hamiltonian @xmath114 which is calculated in the case of @xmath115 .",
    "we plot the cluster - energy increase per unit time in fig.[result_pcluster_d ] , which is evaluated by a linear fit of the expectation values ; the linear fit is done by averaging two lines which come in contact with two consecutive cycles of the oscillation curve of the cluster energy , because in this case a @xmath65 linear fit under large oscillation compared to the slope gives large estimation errors . in the figure , a peak ( peaks ) are observed in the case of @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) . in the peak region , the energy of the cluster increases over time .",
    "therefore the cluster does not completely reach a steady state in the finite simulation time , since the cluster energy should not change in a steady state . on the other hand , we observe that the system reaches a steady state out of the peak region in our simulation time .",
    "the values of @xmath1 giving the peak - structure are a bit larger than those in fig.[result_p_d_r1](b ) , so the excessive energy flux into the cluster corresponds to the decreasing @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the steady state assumed becomes the farthest from the initial state just after the peak region of @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , the total energy increase in figs . [ result_p_d_r1](a ) and ( b ) approximately represents the energy increase per unit time after the steady state ( with no increase in the cluster energy ) has been established , because the cluster - energy increase is much smaller than the total energy increase .     versus cloud density @xmath1 for @xmath118 and @xmath96 at @xmath119 .",
    "we compare nave mean - field results with the dmrg results , in order to investigate the many - body effects in the system . under a mean - field approximation ,",
    "the background particles move in the potential created by the average interaction with the cluster , which is calculated by the density distribution of the cluster particles of the ground state ( e.g. , a gaussian function at @xmath100 ) .",
    "the potential moves by velocity @xmath33 , pushes the cloud , and excites the system .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian of the background particles is @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath122 are normalization constants ; @xmath123 are the wavefunctions of the cluster particles trapped by a harmonic trap .",
    "the energy increase per unit time under this hamiltonian is calculated by solving the scattering problem for the potential @xmath124 . on the coordinates fixed to the trap",
    ", the reflectance @xmath125 can be calculated as a function of incident momentum @xmath126 . within the time @xmath127 ,",
    "the number of reflected particles whose momenta are between @xmath126 and @xmath128 is @xmath129 therefore the energy increase per unit time can be computed as @xmath130 we calculate @xmath125 and @xmath131 numerically , in the case of @xmath119 .    the mean - field results are compared with the dmrg results in fig . [ result_meanfield ] .",
    "we find that they have the same tendency in the small @xmath1 region , although they are slightly different in their scale of @xmath1 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , they disagree in the large @xmath1 region : the mean - field results have small plateaus , instead of peaks which are observed in the dmrg results .",
    "this is partially because the mean - field potential does not strongly scatter the background fermions with larger momenta than the fermi momentum of the cluster ; if the fermi momentum of the background is much larger than that of the cluster , the moving mean - field potential has little effect .",
    "thus , while the mean - field theory can explain this dynamics for small @xmath1 with a slight transformation in scale , it fails to explain the second peaks in the large @xmath1 region",
    ". therefore the many - body effects such as the internal degrees of freedom of the cluster have a crucial role in forming the peak structure in the large @xmath1 region ; the possible model for this system , which is one of the future works , has to contain its many - body effects .     for @xmath95 at @xmath119 . ]",
    "in summary , using the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method and the fermi  hubbard model , we have calculated the drag dynamics of several fermions in a fermion cloud in one - dimensional continuous systems .",
    "we have obtained the steady energy increase per unit time as a function of the particle number of the cluster @xmath0 , the cloud density , the mass ratio between fermions , the interaction strength , and the trap speed .",
    "we have discovered the emergence of a double - peak structure ; one is in the low cloud density region , and the other is in the high cloud density region .",
    "we have revealed that when one wants to reduce the system excitation in moving a fermion cluster in a fermion cloud , one should move the cluster packed together if the cloud density is low , but one should move the fermions in separate @xmath0 traps if the cloud density is higher .",
    "we have introduced a mean - field approximation for the system to estimate whether and how this dynamics can be explained by semiclassical models .",
    "we have elucidated that the drag dynamics in the high density fermion cloud can not be explained by our mean - field model , while it can be reproduced with a small scale transformation in the low cloud density ; we have emphasized the quantum effects in the drag dynamics of a cluster bound in a fermion cloud .",

    "<S> we study drag dynamics of several fermions in a fermion cloud in one - dimensional continuous systems , with particular emphasis on the non - trivial quantum many - body effects in systems whose parameters change gradually in real time . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the fermi  hubbard model and the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method to calculate the drag force on a trapped fermion cluster in a cloud of another fermion species with contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation result shows that a non - trivial peak in the resistance force is observed in the high cloud density region , which implies a criterion of effective ways in diffusive transport in a fermion cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the dmrg simulation result with a mean - field result , and it is suggested that some internal degrees of freedom have a crucial role in the excitation process when the cloud density is high . </S>",
    "<S> this work emphasizes the difference between the full - quantum calculation and the semiclassical calculation , which is the quantum effects , in slow dynamics of many - body systems bound in a fermion cloud . </S>"
