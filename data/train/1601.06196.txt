    "it is not seldom that seemingly abstract mathematical models find widespread application in several fields of theoretical as well as applied physics .",
    "a paramount example of this is einstein s theory of general relativity , because in order to achieve the accuracy that render gps useful , relativistic effects must be taken into account .",
    "filling the gap from theory to applied engineering is only a matter of time .",
    "fortunately , the time span from conception to application gets shorter and shorter .",
    "so is the case with the study of chern - simons ( cs ) forms @xcite to its applications in topological insulators , spintronics and topological quantum computer science @xcite .",
    "the relevance of cs forms also is apparent in theoretical physics . in quantum field theories they play a prominent role in regards to anomalies .",
    "the existence of anomalies can jeopardize the consistence of the theory as they would be indicative of gauge symmetry violation , hence the need for anomaly cancellation mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , anomalies are needed to account for certain experimental observables _",
    "e.g. _ , the proper neutral pion decay rate into two photons as predicted by the non - conservation of the axial - vector current generated by the abj anomaly @xcite .",
    "the latter can be expressed as the one - loop contribution to the divergence of a pseudo - vector or axial current @xmath2 . in general relativity",
    "a similar argument holds . in @xmath3",
    "spacetime dimensions general relativity can be thought of as a non - abelian gauge theory for the @xmath4 gauge group of local lorentz transformations , for which case a gravitational anomaly exists @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lepton - number current and @xmath7 is the pontryagin class in @xmath3 dimensions . here",
    "one can cancel the anomaly by adding the appropriate counter term to the einstein - hilbert action , which turns out to be a cs extension of general relativity .",
    "further , this cs extended general relativity when applied to the cosmological context was posed as a possible explanation for matter - antimatter ( baryon ) asymmetry in the universe @xcite .",
    "actually it is a lepton number asymmetry , however particular weak interaction processes in the sm mediated by @xmath8 instantons ( sphalerons ) can transmute leptons into baryons under certain conditions that would have been met during the out - of - equilibrium inflationary epoch of the universe @xcite .    in a very simple guise",
    ", cs terms were used by peccei and quinn by the introduction of the axion in order to solve the strong cp - problem of qcd @xcite . soon after t hooft realized that the unobserved @xmath9 symmetry of qcd can be understood due to the dynamics of instantons thooft:1986nc .",

    "we will be concerned with a simple case of cs theories , akin to axion - electrodynamics , introduced by wilczek as mentioned above in the context of particle physics .",
    "we will refer to this particular model as @xmath0-electrodynamics or simply @xmath0 ed and it amounts to extending maxwell electromagnetism by a gauge invariant term of the form @xmath10 here though , @xmath0 is no longer a dynamical field but rather we take it as a constant , a genuine lorentz scalar and thus eq .",

    "@xmath0 ed under consideration here has been studied as a 3 + 1 particular kind of maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics ( mcs ) , where it has received considerable attention @xcite . and also it has been studied as a restricted subset of the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite , where several results have been achieved too @xcite .",
    "further , the topological nature of the @xmath0 term of eq .",
    "( [ ff * ] ) can be seen by the fact that this cs extension is a total derivative .",
    "therefore it produces no contribution to the field equations of motion when usual boundary conditions are met , the contribution is a boundary term that vanishes whenever one imposes the vanishing of the fields at the boundary ( or at infinity in the case the theory is defined over the whole space ) .",
    "should @xmath0 cease to be a constant in the manifold where the theory is defined , the cs term fails to be a topological invariant and therefore the corresponding modifications to the field equations must be taken into consideration .    in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the simplest non - trivial case in this context , namely we will study the modifications to maxwell s theory defined on a manifold in which , either : ( a ) there are two domains defined by their different constant values of @xmath0 _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 is space dependent @xmath15 or ( b ) there is a non - vanishing @xmath0 value and the manifold has a boundary where the fields or their derivatives are not vanishing , with either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "a constant @xmath0 can be thought of as an effective parameter characterizing properties of a novel electromagnetic vacuum , possibly arising from a more fundamental theory , where discontinuities in the value of @xmath0 has interesting properties .",
    "this approach has been taken in the context of classical @xmath0 ed @xcite and in the context of quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "a similar avenue has been taken in the context of janus field theories @xcite .",
    "these were motivated from the gravitational sector of the ads / cft correspondence , by an exact and non - singular solution for the dilatonic field in type iib supergravity @xcite .",

    "as studied in this work , see @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , as applied to material media , @xmath0 can be regarded as an effective macroscopic parameter to describe new degrees of freedom of quantum matter .",
    "this approach has been thoroughly used in the context of topological insulators ( ti ) as will be explained below .",
    "first , recall that in general cs forms are amenable for capturing topological features of the physical system that they describe .",
    "formally this can be seen from the action principle .",
    "given a symmetry group and an odd - dimensional differentiable manifold where fields and functions are defined , a gauge connection one - form can be defined whose associated curvature two - form can be used to build @xmath17-forms that : ( i ) are gauge invariant under the symmetry group , ( ii ) are closed and therefore expressible in terms of a @xmath18-form and ( iii ) its integral is a topological invariant .",
    "this last point is crucial revealing the importance of boundaries .",
    "its many uses in gravitation and the former description are clearly reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the latter description is tailor - made for the understanding what came to be known as topological phases .",
    "the discovery of the quantum hall ( qh ) state made manifest the existence of new states of matter that do not fall into landau - ginzburg s effective field theory paradigm . in it the quantum mechanical states of matter that determine the different phases are characterized by the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry of the quantum mechanical system .",
    "von klitzing s discovery of the astonishing precision with which the hall conductance of a sample is quantized von klitzing:1980 kg , despite the varying irregularities of the sample , turned out to have a topological origin .",
    "the ensuing electric current along the edge of a @xmath19 electron gas at very low temperature , due to an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the sample , is in fact insensitive to the sample s geometric details .",
    "the reason for this lies in the band structure of the sample . for",
    "the qh state the system is insulating in the bulk and conducting in the boundary .",
    "the hamiltonian of the many - particle system in the bulk exhibits an energy gap separating the ground state from the excited states . on the contrary ,",
    "for the edge states the band structure is gapless .",
    "furthermore one can define a smooth deformation in the hamiltonian s parameter space ( the symmetry transformation referred to in the previous paragraph , the transformation taking the coffee mug to a torus ) that does not close the bulk gap . to finally understand the connection with topology , one can recall the gauss - bonnet formula and berry s phase , the generalization of the concept of curvature to quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the former allows to express the genus @xmath20 of a surface @xmath21 in terms of an integral over the local curvature of the surface .",
    "the latter is a measure of the phase accumulated by a wave - function as it evolves under a slow and closed variation in the parameter space of the hamiltonian . back in the qh scenario ,",
    "the hall conductance can be expressed as an invariant integral over the frequency momentum space , more precisely as an integral of the berry curvature over the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "this quantity plays the role of a topological order parameter uniquely determining the nature of the quantum state inasmuch as the order parameter in landau - ginzburg effective field theory determines the usual phases of quantum matter .    as mentioned previously , cs terms lends themselves for the description of topological features of a given physical system .",
    "concretely , in material science systems , the low - energy limit of the electrodynamics of topological insulators can be described by extending maxwell electrodynamics precisely by the @xmath0 term of eq .",
    "( [ ff * ] ) , originally formulated in 4 + 1 dimensions but appropriately adapted to lower dimensions by dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath0 ed as a topological field theory ( tft ) , serves as model for many theoretical maciejko:2010yg , maciejko:2010tx , wang:2010uy and experimental realizations for studying detailed properties of topological states of quantum matter @xcite .",
    "see also the review papers @xcite and references therein .",
    "the general scope of this work is to introduce green s function ( gf ) methods in @xmath0 ed , which are well suited to deal with the calculation of electric and magnetic fields arising from arbitrary sources , as well as to solve problems with given dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions on arbitrary surfaces .",
    "this approach is more general than the method of images which , to our knowledge , has been systematically employed in most of the previous works on the related literature . on the other hand , the gf method provides a precise starting point from where either analytical or numerical approximations can be performed . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have already presented the first steps in this direction by constructing the gf for a @xmath0 boundary with planar geometry .",

    "the gf for a stack of layered time - reversal - symmetry - broken ti has been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to describe novel field patterns arising from the magnetoelectric effect due to a dipole close to the surface of the ti .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we review the basics of chern - simons electrodynamics defined on a four dimensional spacetime characterized by a piecewise constant value of @xmath0 in different regions of space separated by a common boundary @xmath1 . to isolate the effects of the @xmath0-term on the gfs and of the stress - energy tensor",
    ", we will take the media on either side of the @xmath1 boundary with no dielectric nor magnetic properties , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath22 and @xmath23 across @xmath1 .",
    "including electric and magnetic susceptibility properties proceeds accordingly .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the case of electro- and magneto - statics .",
    "as in usual maxwell electrodynamics a robust static theory is necessary and important to understand the dynamical case as well as the ensuing quantum electrodynamics . in this scenario",
    "the field equations remain the standard maxwell equations in the bulk , but the discontinuity of @xmath0 modifies the behavior of the fields at the interface @xmath1 .",
    "the most striking feature of this theory is that even in the static limit , electric and magnetic fields are intertwined .",
    "aspects about a possibility to circumvent earnshaw s theorem and how to obtain the modified conservation laws are revised , in particular a detailed construction of the stress - energy tensor is presented .    in section [ green ]",
    "we start by adapting green s theorem to incorporate the contributions of the @xmath0 boundary .",
    "also we classify the different boundary conditions that can be imposed there . restricting ourselves to the case where we do not impose boundary conditions at the @xmath0 interface ( _ i.e. _ , boundary conditions only at infinity ) we consider the simplest geometries for the @xmath1 : planar , cylindrical and spherical .",
    "we present a brief review of the planar case and construct the static gf matrix for the remaining geometries , thus providing the general solution to the modified field equations for the case of arbitrary configuration of sources .",
    "the method can be extended to the case of other geometries but we focus on these configurations given the fact that those are the ones that have attracted the most part of the experimental efforts .",
    "this is an important part of our paper . in it , not only do we aim to provide practical solutions for a given boundary value problems with arbitrary external sources , but also to provide a means to improve the understanding of the theory .    in the appendices we present the detailed calculations of the green s matrix elements for the cases of cylindrical and spherical geometries for the @xmath0 boundary . in section [ applications ]",
    "we present a simple application of the adapted green s theorem when dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on a planar @xmath24 .",
    "also we discuss other applications , where we make contact between the results obtained with our method and others in the existing literature , a comparison that endorses our approach .",
    "for instance , the problem of a point - like charge near a spherical @xmath25 boundary together with the cases of a current - carrying wire and a uniformly charged wire near a cylindrical @xmath0 boundary . finally , in section [ summary ] we summarize our results and give further concluding remarks . throughout the paper , lorentz - heaviside units",
    "are assumed ( @xmath26 ) , the metric signature will be taken as @xmath27 and the convention @xmath28 is adopted .",
    "let us consider the additional coupling of electrodynamics with the electromagnetic pontryagin invariant @xmath30 via a scalar field @xmath31 defined by the action @xmath32 ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the fine structure constant , @xmath34 is the dual of the field strength tensor and @xmath35 is a conserved external current .",
    "the coupling constant for the @xmath0-term , @xmath36 , is chosen in such a way that the dirac quantization condition for the magnetic charge be an integer multiple of @xmath37 , as discussed in wilczek:1987mv .",
    "the topological nature of the pontryagin density makes the equations of motions arising from the action ( [ action ] ) invariant under the change @xmath38 , with @xmath39 any constant .",
    "quantum mechanical arguments impose further conditions on @xmath39 , which will be discussed in the following .",
    "the @xmath40-dimensional spacetime is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a three - dimensional manifold and @xmath43 corresponds to the temporal axis .",

    "this situation is expressed in the characteristic function @xmath51 in this scenario the @xmath0-term in the action fails to be a global topological invariant because it is defined over a region with the boundary @xmath52 .",
    "varying the action gives rise to a set of maxwell s equations with an effective additional current with support at the boundary @xmath53where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the outward unit normal to @xmath1 and @xmath56 current conservation can be verified directly by taking the divergence at both sides of eq .",

    "( [ gausse]-[faraday ] ) the behavior of @xmath31 ed in the bulk regions @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the same as in standard electrodynamics .",
    "the @xmath31-term modifies maxwell s equations only at the surface @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "equations ( [ gausse]-[faraday ] ) also suggest that the electromagnetic response of a system in the presence of a @xmath31-term can be described in terms of maxwell equations in matter @xmath68with constitutive relations @xmath69 where @xmath70 is given in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath71 is globally constant in @xmath72 , there is no contribution to maxwell s equations from the @xmath0 term in the action , even though @xmath71 still is present in the constitutive relations .",
    "in fact , the additional contributions of a globally constant @xmath73  to each of the equations ( [ mematt ] ) cancel due to the homogeneous equations ( [ gaussb ] ) and ( [ faraday ] ) .",
    "so far we have considered @xmath0 as an external parameter that can take arbitrary values , albeit respecting the re - scaling symmetry @xmath74 that we already mentioned .",
    "naively this would allow to set @xmath0 to zero at the classical level .",
    "however , quantum mechanically , given that for properly quantized electric and magnetic fluxes @xmath75 is an integer multiple of @xmath0 , then the only allowed values of @xmath39 are @xmath76 for integer @xmath77 , otherwise non - trivial contributions to the path integral would result .",
    "the above argument together with additional considerations about the behavior of the system under time - reversal ( tr ) can further constrain @xmath0 . in fact , in the context of tis it was originally assumed that only systems with broken tr symmetry were of relevance , however it was soon realized that systems preserving tr symmetry were as important , see ref .",
    "@xcite . given the pseudo - scalar nature under tr of the cs coupling : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the time - reversal operator @xmath80",
    ", it seems that breaking tr symmetry is inescapable .",
    "however , tr symmetry can be preserved as long as @xmath0 takes the values @xmath81 or @xmath82 ( mod @xmath83 ) . for @xmath84",
    "the system is trivially tr invariant whereas for @xmath85 it can be restored by suitably re - scaling @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath86 can be made tr invariant by @xmath87 .",
    "for the sake of generality , in the sequel we will not restrict to systems with a definite tr symmetry property , therefore the only relevant constraint for @xmath0 that we will consider is that its observable effects satisfy the @xmath88 symmetry , @xcite .",
    "this property is made self - evident because all our observable results will depend only on the combination @xmath89 given in eq .",
    "( [ tilde ] ) .",
    "assuming that the time derivatives of the fields are finite , in the vicinity of the surface @xmath24 the field equations imply that the normal component of @xmath90 , and the tangential components of @xmath91 , acquire discontinuities additional to those produced by superficial free charges and currents , while the normal component of @xmath91 , and the tangential components of @xmath90 , are continuous .",
    "for vanishing external sources on @xmath24 the boundary conditions read : @xmath92 the notation is @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for any vector @xmath95 .",
    "the continuity conditions , ( [ gaussb - bc ] ) and ( [ faraday - bc ] ) , imply that the right hand sides of equations ( [ gausse - bc ] ) and ( [ ampere - bc ] ) are well defined and they represent surface charge and current densities , respectively .",
    "an immediate consequence of the boundary conditions is that the presence of a magnetic field crossing the surface @xmath24 is sufficient to generate an electric field , even in the absence of free electric charges . for a @xmath31 boundary characterizing different @xmath31 values of the electromagnetic vacuum , these issues together with some of its consequences over the propagation of electromagnetic waves across such interface where studied in refs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that with the modified boundary conditions , several properties of conductors in static fields still hold as far as the conductor does not lie in the @xmath24 boundary . in particular , conductors are equipotential surfaces and the electric field just outside the conductor is normal to its surface .",
    "it is a well established fact in ordinary electrostatics that due to electrostatic forces alone a charge can not be in stable equilibrium ( earnshaw s theorem ) .",
    "more generally , no static object comprised of electric charges , magnets and masses can be held in static equilibrium by any combination of electric , magnetic or gravitational forces .",
    "it is natural to ask whether in the case of @xmath0 boundaries a charge can or can not be held in stable equilibrium due to electrostatic forces alone .",
    "this question is certainly relevant from an experimental point of view , but also theoretically . as we will show below , the case of @xmath0 ed",
    "is an interesting one as it opens a window to circumvent earnshaw s theorem . in usual electromagnetism",
    "the lack of existence of stable equilibrium points is proven by contradiction , owing to the fact that , away from the sources , the electrostatic potential satisfies laplace s equation .",
    "we will show that in @xmath0 electromagnetism there exist points where such contradiction no longer takes place . from the eq .",
    "( gausse ) and @xmath96 we have @xmath97 we inquire whether the potential has an extremum at a point @xmath98 where a test charge is to be held in equilibrium .",
    "the argument proceeds in the usual manner .",
    "suppose that there exists a point @xmath98 at which @xmath99 acquires a minimum .",
    "then at every point over the surface of any small closed surface enclosing @xmath98 , one must have @xmath100 , where @xmath77 denotes the outward normal direction to the surface and thus one must have @xmath101 where the volume @xmath102 encloses @xmath98 . due to @xmath103 and to the divergence theorem , this latter integral can be cast into a volume integral of the laplacian of the potential .",
    "again , to isolate the contribution due to the @xmath0-term we set @xmath104 to obtain @xmath105 in ordinary maxwell electrostatics ( @xmath106 ) the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ earnshaw ] ) vanishes leading to a contradiction with eq .",
    "( [ potential_extremum ] ) and thus proving that @xmath98 can not be a local minimum . in the case of @xmath0 ed however , as far as @xmath107 and a non - vanishing normal magnetic field at @xmath1 exists , the aforementioned contradiction no longer occurs , for points @xmath98 at @xmath1 , thus removing the immediate obstruction of ordinary electromagnetism for the existence of local minima .",
    "we emphasize that by no means we are claiming to have proven the existence of points of stable equilibrium in @xmath0 electrostatics , which can be dealt with elsewhere . to this end , a more thorough analysis is required along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of ordinary electromagnetism .",
    "we consider this an important issue . charged or magnetized matter can be held in static equilibrium in a given experimental setup . however , if this were possible only with the aid of external devices as tweezers or dynamical mechanisms or em traps _ e.g. _ , penning traps @xcite , these could compromise the precision of the measurements or interact with the em fields under study .      for the case of @xmath31 ed we still expect the electromagnetic field to be an energy - momentum transmitting entity . in this way ,",
    "for example , we should be able to compute the net force over a given region in 3-space in terms of the values of the electromagnetic fields on the bounding surface of that region .",
    "this requires to establish conservation laws , as in ordinary maxwell electrodynamics . in section [ feandbc ]",
    "we showed that the @xmath0 term modifies the behavior of the fields at the surface @xmath24 only .",

    "in fact , the identification of the stress - energy tensor proceeds along the standard lines of electrodynamics in a medium ( see for example ref .",

    "for example , when dealing with the calculation of casimir energies , the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum can be obtained with the aid of the corresponding gf for maxwell electrodynamics @xcite . using this method ,",
    "insights regarding corrections to the casimir energy in the context of @xmath31 ed have been developed in refs .",

    "@xcite for a related perspective .",
    "this approach serves as an additional motivation for the following section [ green ] .",
    "in this section we use the gf method to solve boundary - value problems in @xmath120 ed in terms of the electromagnetic potential @xmath121 .",

    "( [ gausse - bc]-[faraday - bc ] ) , however , just as in ordinary electrodynamics , there might be occasions where , besides the knowledge of the external sources , we are provided with requirements on the fields at the given boundaries . in these cases , the gf method provides the general solution , to a given boundary value problem ( dirichlet or neumann ) for arbitrary sources .",
    "the importance of such a general solution is evident from an experimental point of view .",
    "for example , it would allow , at least in principle , to predict the electromagnetic response of topological insulators with planar , spherical or cylindrical boundaries in the presence of more intricate configuration of sources .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned in section [ st ] , the gf method is useful for computing the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor in the context of casimir forces .",
    "furthermore , the gf method should be also useful for the solution of dynamical problems in @xmath31 ed .    in the following we concentrate only on the static case .",
    "since the homogeneous maxwell equations that express the relationship between potentials and fields are not modified in @xmath31 ed , the electrostatic and magnetostatic fields can be written in terms of the four - potential @xmath122 according to @xmath123 and @xmath124 , as usual . in the coulomb gauge @xmath125 ,",
