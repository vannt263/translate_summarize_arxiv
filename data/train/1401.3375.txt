    "managing wireless interference through infrastructural enhancements is a major consideration for next generation cellular networks .",
    "one example of such an enhancement is in cellular downlink through the assignment of one receiver s message to multiple base station transmitters and managing interference through a coordinated multi - point transmission ( comp ) scheme .",

    "we therefore consider a cooperation constraint that is more general and relevant to many scenarios of practical significance .",
    "in particular , we define the _ backhaul load _ constraint @xmath0 as the ratio between the sum of the transmit set sizes for all the messages and the number of users . in other words",
