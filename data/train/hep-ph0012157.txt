    "additional complications arise due to the mixing involved to make the mass eigenstates and the fact that at high energies , the longitudinal degrees of freedom are not suppressed . furthermore , since the asymptotic states are not group singlets , it is expected that fully inclusive cross sections contain bloch - nordsieck violating electroweak corrections @xcite .",

    "it is then possible to calculate corrections in the effective high energy theory in each case yielding the same result as calculations in the physical basis .",

    "it is also conceptually important for a theoretical understanding of the infrared behavior of the sm . by comparing the subleading universal terms with existing one - loop calculations ,",

    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "first , however , we are going to discuss the scalar high energy sector in the standard model .",
    "in particular , there are additional corrections of the yukawa type which need to be discussed , for which there is no analogue in unbroken gauge theories .      at high energies ,",

    "( [ eq : lpv ] ) we can write @xmath36 we see that in principle , there are logarithmic loop corrections to the tree level equivalence theorem . the important point in our approach , however , is that the correction coefficients are not functions of the energy variable @xmath37 : @xmath38    the pictorial form of the goldstone boson equivalence theorem is depicted in fig .",

    "<S> future colliders will probe the electroweak theory at energies much larger than the gauge boson masses . </S>",
    "<S> large double ( dl ) and single ( sl ) logarithmic virtual electroweak sudakov corrections lead to significant effects for observable cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> recently , leading and subleading universal corrections for external fermions and transverse gauge boson lines were resummed by employing the infrared evolution equation method . </S>",
    "<S> the results were confirmed at the dl level by explicit two loop calculations with the physical standard model ( sm ) fields . also for longitudinal degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> the approach was utilized for dl - corrections via the goldstone boson equivalence theorem . in all cases , the electroweak sudakov logarithms exponentiate . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend the same approach to both yukawa enhanced as well as subleading sudakov corrections to longitudinal gauge boson and higgs production . </S>",
    "<S> we use virtual contributions to splitting functions of the appropriate goldstone bosons in the high energy regime and find that all universal subleading terms exponentiate . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is verified by employing a non - abelian version of gribov s factorization theorem and by explicit comparison with existing one loop calculations . as a side result , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain also all top - yukawa enhanced subleading logarithms for chiral fermion production at high energies to all orders . in all cases , the size of the subleading contributions at the two loop level is non - negligible in the context of precision measurements at future linear colliders .    </S>",
