    "galactic black hole x - ray binary systems manifest themselves as x - ray novae and most of them are discovered via their sudden dramatic increase in x - ray brightness .",
    "such an x - ray outburst is due to a change of the amount of material accreted from the companion star by the central compact object .",
    "in addition to x - ray follow - up observations following the evolution of the outburst , multi - wavelength observations play an important role in understanding the physics of these systems .",
    "in particular , reprocessing in the accretion disk and the companion star will also generate optical emission .",
    "we therefore expect to see a dramatic change in optical brightness when an x - ray nova is in outburst .",
    "optical observations provide the data necessary to determine the orbital period , the evolutionary state of the secondary , the binary mass function , and mass of the compact object itself . in combination with x - ray spectral and timing studies ,",
    "these provide a detailed picture of the accretion process and the nature of the compact object .",
    "although the optical counterpart of an x - ray nova is usually discovered during an outburst , observations when the source returns to quiescence are also extremely important . while the optical emission of an x - ray nova is very faint in quiescence , it is the best time to study the nature of the companion star and the geometry of the binary system , and to measure the mass function via radial velocity measurements .",
    "the x - ray transient maxij1659152  was first discovered with the _ swift _  burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 2010 september 25 as a gamma - ray burst ( grb 100925a ; mangano et al .",

    "2009 ) suggested that it is a previously unknown galactic x - ray transient .",
    "the optical counterpart of maxij1659152  was discovered with the _ swift _  ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) immediately after the bat trigger ( marshall 2010 ) .",
    "subsequent multi - wavelength observations from radio to hard x - ray showed that maxij1659152  is a black hole binary candidate .",
    "in particular , frequent x - ray dips with a recurrent time of 2.4 hours were found in _ rxte _ , _ swift _ , and _ xmm - newton _  observations ( kennea et al .",
    "2011 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "this strongly suggests that maxij1659152  is a highly inclined system with an orbital period of 2.4 hours , the shortest among all the black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "maxij1659152  returned to quiescence as observed with _",

    "( 2012 ) noting that it is too bright for maxij1659152 .    in this paper ,",
    "we report our new deep optical imaging observation of maxij1659152  in quiescence using the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) aimed at measuring an accurate quiescent optical magnitude .",
    "we also re - analysed the ps1 data for comparison .",
    "maxij1659152  was observed with the megaprime / megacam at the cfht on 2012 march 23 .",
    "we checked the _ maxi _ gsc daily data and the source was not detected in soft x - ray indicating that it was likely in quiescence .",
    "however , we caution that if there is an x - ray mini - outburst , maxij1659152  will not be detected with _",

    "the megacam has an array of 36 ccds , giving a total of 1 degree by 1 degree field - of - view .",

    "; see also fig .",
    "1 ) , the optical counterpart of maxij1659152  is clearly a variable ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we further compared the cfht position of maxij1659152  with the european vlbi network position ( paragi et al .",
    "2010 ) ; the offset between the two positions is @xmath6 indicating that it is the true optical counterpart .",

    "as part of the @xmath7 survey , the field of maxij1659152  was observed with various filters several times each , but the source was only marginally seen with the @xmath0-band filter taken on 2010 june 19 with an exposure time of 40 seconds . since it is a few months before the first discovery of the outburst , the source should be in quiescence . as a check ,",
    "the _ maxi _ gsc light curve did not show any enhancement in the x - ray flux .",
    "since maxij1659152  is not in the @xmath7 survey catalog , we determined its magnitude by comparing with several catalogued stars .",

    "in table 1 , we list the @xmath0-band magnitudes of maxij1659152  and a couple of check stars of the cfht and ps1 observations . given that our new cfht observations were taken more than 7 months after the end of an x - ray outburst confirmed by _",
    "chandra _",
    "( jonker et al . 2012 ) and there is no unusual x - ray activity shown in the _ maxi _ gsc data , maxij1659152  is likely in the quiescent state although we can not totally rule out a mini - outburst or a very long optical decay .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitude of maxij1659152  varied between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in 30 minutes .",
    "the two check stars near maxij1659152  did not show any variability , indicating that maxij1659152  is likely a variable star .    for the ps1 data ,",
    "maxij1659152  is marginally visible with a @xmath0-band magnitude of @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the quick - look analysis reported by kong et al .",
    "we examined all the ps1 images in this field and the observation reported here has the best seeing and image quality among all the images .",
    "this may explain why maxij1659152  was only detected in this observation .",
    "furthermore , the cfht images indicate that maxij1659152  can be fainter than the ps1 measurement .",
    "it could happen that the ps1 observation was taken during a relatively bright state in the quiescence .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "from both the cfht and ps1 observations , we can conclude that the optical counterpart of maxij1659152  shows variability during or near quiescence . in figure 1",
    ", we also show a @xmath11-band image taken near the end of an outburst with the 1 m telescope at the lulin observatory in taiwan ( kong et al .",
    "maxij1659152  is clearly much fainter during our cfht observations .",
    "optical variability is quite common for black hole x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "for example , grs1124 - 684 , a0620 - 00 , j0422 + 32 , gs2000 + 25 , and v404 cyg show flarings on timescales of a few minutes to 60 minutes with a typical amplitude of 0.10.6 mag ( zurita et al . 2003 ; shahbaz et al .",
    "2003,2010 ) .",
    "bw cir ( = gs1354 - 64 ) is another quiescent black hole that exhibits large ( 0.51 mag ) optical variability ( casares et al .",
    "the origin of optical flaring during quiescence is not well understood .",
    "possible mechanisms include x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk ( hynes et al .",
    "2004 ) , magnetic reconnection events ( zurita et al . 2003 ) , and direct synchrotron emission from an advective dominated flow ( shahbaz et al . 2003 ) . simultaneous x - ray and optical observations are required to understand their nature ( e.g. , hynes et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in addition to optical flaring activity , the orbital variation can contribute to the observed variability .",
    "maxij1659152  is shown to have a 2.4-hour orbital period based on the dip - like events in the x - ray light curves ( kuulkers et al .",
    "in particular , the two cfht observations are separated by about 30 minutes , equivalent to about 0.2 orbital phase .",
    "variability is therefore not unexpected .",
    "the 0.2 mag difference is also consistent with other black hole x - ray transients with measured optical orbital modulation ( e.g. , see fig . 1 of zurita et al .",
    "future optical monitoring observations will be crucial to reveal the optical orbital modulation .",
    "our new cfht observations strongly suggest that the proposed optical counterpart of maxij1659152  is real and it shows noticeable variability that could be from flaring or orbital modulation .",
    "even we adopt the faintest measurement from our cfht observations ( @xmath12 ) , it is in contrast to the suggestion that the quiescent magnitude is @xmath13 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "we note that the orbital modulation can not produce such a huge optical variability ( @xmath14 mag ) unless the compact object has strong radiation to evaporate the companion like black widow - type pulsars ( e.g. , kong et al .",
    "the suggested quiescent optical magnitude is based on a relationship between the optical outburst amplitude of an x - ray transient and the orbital period found by shahbaz and kuulkers ( 1998 ; hereafter sk98 ) . with an orbital period of 2.4 hours",
    ", the @xmath15-band magnitude difference between the outburst and quiescence should be as large as 11 magnitudes , yielding @xmath16 in the quiescence .",
    "taking the inclination effect into account , the quiescent @xmath15 magnitude is @xmath17 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2012 ) . by using previous ps1 measurement in the @xmath0 band ( kong et al .",
    "2010 ) and the limiting magnitudes of the ps1 @xmath7 survey , kuulkers et al .",
    "( 2012 ) derived an expected @xmath15-band magnitude of @xmath18 ; although it can not rule out a much fainter object , a difference of at least 3 magnitudes indicates that maxij1659152  unlikely follows the sk98 relation .",
    "however , we caution that the sk98 relation is an empirical relation based on a sample of 11 black hole transients and there are many factors ( e.g. , the stellar type of the companion star , the inclination effect on the disk emission , and the peak mass transfer rate ) affecting the correlation .",
    "hence , scatter on the correlation is not unexpected .    to estimate the @xmath15-band magnitude",
    ", we first assume the spectrum of the companion .",
    "given that maxij1659152  is likely a m2 or m5 dwarf ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2012 ; jonker et al .",
    "2012 ) , the colors will become @xmath19 ( m2 dwarf ) or @xmath20 ( m5 dwarf ) .",
    "we then correct the colors for the reddening assuming the galactic values provided by schlafly et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . using the transformation of tonry et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we get a reddened @xmath21 color of 0.3 for both cases .",
    "the reddened @xmath22 is 1.9 and 2.2 for a m2 dwarf and a m5 dwarf , respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 is 1.6 ( 1.9 ) for a m2 dwarf ( m5 dwarf ) .",
    "using the observed @xmath0-band magnitude ( 23.8 ) from our cfht observation , we have @xmath24 for a m2 dwarf and @xmath25 for a m5 dwarf .",
    "these are consistent with the above limits derived by kuulkers ( 2012 ) . in any case , the estimated quiescent @xmath15-band magnitude is within 1 magnitude difference for a high - inclination ( @xmath26 ) system although the difference could be as large as 2 magnitudes for a lower inclination ( @xmath27 ) system .    based on our new cfht measurement , although the estimated @xmath15-band magnitude is still brighter , it is not a large offset as proposed by kuulkers et al . (",
    "2012 ) . as we mentioned above",
    ", there are other factors causing scatter on the sk98 correlation . for instance",
    ", the black hole x - ray binary xte j1118 + 480 has an orbital period of 4.08 hours and the outburst amplitude is about 67 magnitudes . according to sk98 , the amplitude is at least 9.4 magnitudes .",
    "however , xte j1118 + 480 is underluminous in outbursts ; the outburst x - ray spectra are hard in contrast to typical high / soft state of x - ray transients in outbursts , and the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio is low ( @xmath28 ; see zurita et al .",
    "2006 for a discussion ) . unlike xte j1118 + 480 , the x - ray spectral behaviors and x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of maxij1659152  are similar to a typical x - ray transient in outburst ( kennea et al .",
    "follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations of maxij1659152  in the future will be able to provide better constraints .",
    "on the other hand , the quiescent x - ray luminosity of maxij1659152  as measured with _",
    "chandra _  is an order of magnitude higher than that derived from the orbital period - x - ray luminosity correlation ( jonker et al .",
    "2012 ) . given that both optical and x - ray brightness are higher than expected ,",
    "one simple explanation is that maxij1659152  is not in a true quiescent state .",
    "it is worth noting that some short orbital period black hole systems have a long decay time .",
    "for example , groj0422 + 32 reached its optical quiescent state 760 days after an outburst ( garcia et al .",
    "further optical and x - ray observations will confirm this .",
    "we now can use the absolute magnitude of the companion to estimate the distance to the source .",
    "the absolute @xmath15-band magnitude of a m2 dwarf and m5 dwarf is 10 and 11.8 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath22 is 1.5 ( 1.8 ) for a m2 ( m5 ) dwarf , this implies @xmath29 is 8.5 ( 10 ) . by using the transformation of tonry et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , @xmath30 becomes 8.77 ( 10.27 ) .",
    "comparing with the reddening ( @xmath31 ; schlafly et al .",
    "2011 ) corrected @xmath0-band magnitude , the distance is 5.3 kpc ( m2 dwarf ) or 2.7 kpc ( m5 dwarf ) . if we further assume the accretion disk contributes 50% of the visible light ( see jonker et al .",
    "2012 ) , then the distance would be between 7.5 kpc ( m2 dwarf ) and 3.8 kpc ( m5 dwarf ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is as large as 1.7 ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) , then the distance to maxij1659152  will be 4.66.5 kpc and 2.33.3 kpc for a m2 dwarf and a m5 dwarf , respectively . comparing with previous estimations ( e.g. , kennea et al .",
    "2011 ; kaur et al .",
    "2012 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "2012 ; jonker et al .",
    "2012 ) , a m2 dwarf companion star is more likely .",
    "this is also consistent with the conclusion made by jonker et al .",
    "on the other hand , if maxij1659152  has a m5 dwarf companion star and a distance of @xmath33 kpc , the observed x - ray luminosity will be consistent with the orbital period - x - ray luminosity correlation ( jonker et al .",
    "future optical spectroscopy during quiescence will be crucial to determine the stellar type of the companion star and hence the distance to the system .",
    "in addition , an ellipsoidal lightcurve modeling during quiescence will allow us to derive the inclination angle of the system .",
    "these observations will also test if the sk98 correlation holds for maxij1659152 . combining with a deep x - ray observation during the quiescent state",
