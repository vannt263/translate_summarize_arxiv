    "since early days of quantum field theory , ( qft ) , 1 + 1 dimensional models have been widely investigated as example of relativistic fields with local interaction : the thirring and the schwinger models , @xcite , @xcite , are probably the most celebrated cases . although these systems are so simplified to have an exact solution , they nonetheless suggest ideas and mathematical tools to approach realistic theories in four space - time dimensions .    one of the aspects that are certain relevant also in higher dimensions is the role played by two ward identities ( ) related to the invariance of the lagrangian under vector and axial transformations . in agreement with the general adler - bell - jackiw mechanism , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the vector and the axial symmetries are _ broken _ at quantum level by the _",
    "anomaly_. many salient features of qft are related to such an anomaly ; let s consider some of them . in any dimensions , by the adler - bardeen ( ab ) argument , @xcite , the anomaly is expected to be _ linear _ in the bare coupling , i.e. not renormalized in loop perturbation theory at any order bigger than one ; besides , it is a _ topological quantity _ , i.e. it does nt depend on the choice of the cutoff ( to some extent ) .",
    "the anomaly is also responsible for the _ anomalous dimension _ in the distance decay of the fermion correlations , @xcite . and , finally , when a fermion field and a gauge photon interact through a _",
    "minimal coupling _ , as for instance in the schwinger model , the anomaly also represents a dynamically - generated physical mass for the photon field , @xcite .    in two dimensions",
    "the anomaly is said `` mild '' : although the formal   are broken , the anomaly has the only consequence of changing the normalization of the vector and axial currents , that remain conserved . therefore using the   it was possible to find _ formal exact solutions _ of the schwinger - dyson equation , ( ) , of the thirring , the schwinger and related models , in this way computing all the correlations : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach - still related to the mildness of the anomaly - is the _ bosonization _ , i.e. the equivalence of the the fermion currents with boson free fields .",
    "this fact is behind the solution of the thirring and the schwinger model , @xcite , @xcite , in the path integral formalism .    the above analysis - and much more , see chapters x and xii of @xcite - has been based on formal methods and sound assumptions only .",
    "rigorous results are few ; though , at this stage , the reader might have few interest left for them .",
    "it is worth explaining , then , why the matter is still very tangled .",
    "in fact , earlier formal solutions of the thirring and the schwinger models were incomplete or incorrect , as pointed out in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . and , after all , the distinction among _ formally correct _ , _ incorrect _ or _ incomplete _ solutions may be quite faint .",
    "wightman , @xcite , to put order in the confusion of the results , took the approach of considering any set of correlation functions , no matter how they were obtained , as trial theories ; and then of promoting them to qft if they satisfied certain axioms .",
    "this viewpoint has been moderately prolific ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is at least one clear issue with it : being based of some sort of exact solution of the correlation functions , it is limited to few special models . a massive fermion field , for example , or an additional interactions that , in the renormalization group language , is irrelevant",
    ", would represent a severe obstruction to the method .",
    "the recent approach to the thirring model in @xcite , @xcite is different .",
    "we derived the correlations from the lagrangian , so that in the massless case we obtained the exact solution , while in the massive case , where no exact solution is known , we can still prove the axioms .",
    "but , most of all , the major advantage of using the lagrangian ( as opposed to correlations ) as starting point , is that it keeps track of the relationship between a special class of statistical mechanical problems - such as the eight - vertex models and the xyz quantum chain - and their scaling limit , that turns out to be the thirring model ; in this way we were able prove some scaling formulas for non solvable models , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the heart of the technique is the control of the vanishing of the `` beta function '' for the effective coupling : this route , that have been useful also for other statistical models , was opened in @xcite by exploiting the exact solution of the luttinger model ; and reached its final form , based on  and independent from any exact solution , in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the extension of the above techniques to the schwinger model poses some serious issues because the infrared divergences related with the massless photon ; therefore we take up a problem of intermediate difficulty , the theory of the vector meson , @xcite , i.e. a schwinger model in which a photon mass is added by hand .",
    "this model still preserves some interests , because we can prove that the bare photon mass is renormalized into the physical mass just by an additive constant , exactly as expected in the schwinger model ; besides , we can establish the anomalous dimension of the fermion field . finally , we can prove the ab - formula in a genuine example of qft , i.e. removing the all the cutoffs of the theory : in this sense this paper is a completion of the objective of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although the present technique allows us to treat other aspects of the theory , we shall not verify the osterwalder - schrader axioms , nor we shall discuss the case with massive fermion or the bosonization of the final result ; this is because details would be largely similar to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we shall rather focus on the novelties with respect to those papers .",
    "to conclude , we mention that other rigorous results on the   anomalies , but in different regimes and with different techniques , were established in @xcite , @xcite . whereas for the study the true schwinger model , i.e. the case with null bare photon mass , a change of viewpoint seems needed : boson and fermion propagators should be treated on the same ground along the renormalization group ( ) flow ; perhaps that is possible in the approach of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let s begin with the definition of the formal path integral formula in euclidean formulation ; afterwords we will introduce _ infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs _ to evaluate the correlations .",
    "the vector meson model is made of one fermion field , @xmath0 , for @xmath1 , and one vector boson field , @xmath2 , interacting through minimal coupling .",
    "the free meson with mass @xmath3 ( a _ gauge field _ if @xmath4 ) is described by the action @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "the quantization of a gauge theory ( namely the case @xmath4 ) requires a _ gauge fixing term _ which makes convergent the integration along the orbits of gauge transformation : for @xmath7 @xmath8 in our case @xmath9 and the gauge fixing would not be required to make sense of the theory .",
    "nevertheless , the vector meson model defined by thirring and wess had the purpose to be equivalent to the schwinger model in the limit of vanishing @xmath3 ; therefore , with them , we shall consider @xmath7 only , that will make the interaction _",
    "superrinormalizable_. for notational convenience , we also introduce a further non - local term for the vector field @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the inverse of the laplacian and @xmath12 is a real parameter with the dimension of the square of a mass .",
    "the three terms we have introduced so far are collected together into the following term & & 12dd a^_d^(- ) a^ _ & & ^_^_- .",
    "sometimes we will write @xmath13 for the operator with kernel @xmath14 .",
    "the massless electron , with charge @xmath15 , interacts with the photon through a _ minimal coupling _",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are generators of the euclidean clifford algebra .",
    "the total euclidean action of the vector meson is @xmath19 finally , putting together all the above terms , we define the _ generating functional _ of the truncated correlations of the the vector meson model , @xmath20 , as follows : e^(j,)dp ( ) dp(a ) \\{d } where @xmath21 is a real external field ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 are grassmann external fields ; @xmath24 is a gaussian measure on grassmann variables @xmath25 with zero covariances , but for @xmath26 that equals @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a gaussian measure on real variables @xmath29 with covariances @xmath30 equal to @xmath31\\ ] ] ( we will abridge the notation of @xmath32 into @xmath33 , sometimes ) . these covariances are also called _ free propagators _ as @xmath34    to make sense of we have to introduce a cutoff function . for a fixed @xmath35 , let @xmath36 be a smooth function , positive in @xmath37 and ( t)= \\{.;then , given two integers @xmath38 , define @xmath39 and in correspondence , define two gaussian measure @xmath40 and @xmath41 , determined by the covariances : @xmath42 @xmath43\\;.\\ ] ] given the integers @xmath44 , the _ regularized functional integral _ , @xmath45 , is given by , replacing @xmath24 and @xmath28 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "finally , let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the _ interacting propagators _ ,",
    "namely the correlations s(-)_-l , n ^2 _ l , n|__(0,0 ) g^(-;^2,)_-l , n^2 _",
    "l , n j^_j^_(0,0 ) where the derivatives in @xmath22 are taken from the right ; and the limit in @xmath50 is taken before the limit in @xmath51 .",
    "define & & f(;^2,)= & & f_5(;^2)= , and note that , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath7 , we have the following large @xmath54 asymptotic : @xmath55    given the meson mass @xmath52 , for @xmath53 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 small enough , the explicit expression of the interacting propagators are : s()=e^q^2s_0 ( ) g^(;^2,)=g_0^(;^2-_5,+-_5 ) with @xmath58 .",
    "this result is uniform in @xmath59 : feynman-t hooft s and landau s gauges , for example , are recovered for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ; the two point correlation of @xmath62 is @xmath63-independent . although means that the interaction changes the free meson correlation of an additional mass term only , the theory is not free ; indeed , in we can see that the large distance decay of the fermion correlation has an anomalous dimension",
    "@xmath22 : s()~1||^1+= q^22we shall see that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the anomalies of the vector and axial s , respectively . to clarify the relation of this result with the literature , it is worth mentioning the ( unproven ) _ uncertainty principle _ of the anomalies , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , namely the fact that the most general numerical values are @xmath66 for @xmath67 a real parameter fixed by the kind of regularization of the functional integral .",
    "hence the meson mass , @xmath65 , is regularization dependent ( this is not an issue for the meaning of the model , because @xmath15 is the _ bare _ , not the _ physical _ charge ) .",
    "our result is in agreement with @xcite , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath60 ; and with @xcite , where @xmath67 is any , @xmath68 , @xmath70 .",
    "solutions of the vector meson model for @xmath71 ( a case that this paper does nt cover ) are in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for @xmath72 , @xmath69 and any @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "those results are in agreement with our theorem only formally : in that case @xmath73 is not defined and from @xmath74 one has to divide out a divergent factor .",
    "this is not a surprise : when @xmath71 the large momentum asymptotic of the free meson propagator is @xmath75 that makes the interaction _ renormalizable _ as in the case of the gradient coupling model , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the correct approach for this case would be the one in @xcite , with vanishing beta function and field renormalization .",
    "anyways that rises a question : the ab - formula is not valid in @xcite , where radiative corrections do change the numerical value of the anomaly ; is this the case also for the @xmath71 vector meson model ? we will discuss this issue in a possible forthcoming paper .    as mentioned in the introduction , were @xmath4 , we would read as the _ dynamical mass generation _ of the schwinger model ; but unfortunately we are not able to cover that case .",
    "firstly , we have to prove that there exist the limits and .",
    "to do that , we use some lesniewski s ideas , @xcite . define the functional integral @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the interaction ( self - interaction plus coupling with external fields ) of a non - local version of the thirring model : ( ps . , j,)= 4dd ( |_^ _ ) g_0^(-)(|_^ _ ) + d j^ _ ( |_^ _ ) + d(|_ps .",
    "_ + |ps . _",
    "_ ) now take the integral over the vector field @xmath78 in , and obtain an identity between the functional integrals of the thirring and the vector meson models , for coupling @xmath79 ( dj,)= ( -qj,)+12dd j^ _ d^(-)j^_. if we can control the field and the current correlation derived from @xmath80 , we can also construct the limits and . to bound the feynman graphs , one has to use that , above the scale of the photon mass , the interaction in @xmath81 is superrinormalizable ; but , to see that in @xmath80 , we will need some identities among feynman graphs , as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this point is discussed in section [ s4.1 ] .",
    "then , with a classical bound for fermion determinant , @xcite , the convergence of the perturbation theory is proved .",
    "secondly , in section [ s4.2 ] , we shall prove that the correlations generated from @xmath80 satisfy two anomalous s . from the ( formal ) invariance under the vector transformation @xmath82 , @xmath83 we obtain the _ vector ward identity _",
    ", i^_d -2i_^j^_=(j,)__- | _ ; and from the ( formal ) invariance under ( euclidean ) axial - vector transformation @xmath84 , @xmath85 , with @xmath86 , using @xmath87 , we obtain the _ axial ward identity _ ^i^_d -2_5^i_^j^_= -(j,)_i^5_- |_i^5(j,)|_. @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the _ adler - bell - jackiw anomalies_. assuming the validity of and , the proof of is just a computation in which the ab - formula plays a crucial role . before showing that , let s pause for some technical comments . at @xmath90 ( i.e. without the terms proportional to @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , and were proved in @xcite for local self interaction of the fermion field , i.e. @xmath91 ; and later on they were proved in @xcite for @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a short - range , bounded self interaction , i.e. without removing ir and uv cutoffs in @xmath93 .",
    "of course the latter case is technically simpler ; nonetheless it is remarkable for , as opposed to the former , it gives an example in which the ab - formula is valid .",
    "the main task of the present paper is to extend the proof of the s to the case @xmath94 and for the given @xmath95 , that is a symmetric matrix with short - ranged but unbounded entries .",
    "to continue the computation , use to turn and into identities for derivatives of @xmath81 ; since @xmath96\\dpr^\\n_\\xx\\ ; , \\qquad \\e^{\\m\\r}\\dpr^\\m_\\xx d^{\\r\\n}_\\xx=\\lft[-\\d_\\xx+\\m^2\\rgt]\\e^{\\r\\n}\\dpr^\\r_\\xx\\;\\ ] ] take a further derivative in @xmath97 , at @xmath98 and obtain : i^_g^(- ) = i^_(-)+ + ( 2q^2- ) i_^g_0^(- ) ^i^_g^(- ) = ^i^_(-)+ + ( 2q^2_5-_5 ) ^i_^ g_0^(- ) here comes the crucial point : in establishing the validity of the and the presence of the anomaly , we will also verify the ab - formula , i.e. the fact the anomaly is given by the first order perturbation theory , without higher order corrections .",
    "therefore we can explicitly evaluate @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath79 , the second line in both equations is zero ; and the theorem is proved by explicit solution of and .",
    "we stress that in formal versions of this computation , @xcite , the quantum anomaly is just added into the classical equations by hand where it is expected , and so the terms proportional to @xmath100 and @xmath101 never appear at all .",
    "to prove , we need the , i.e. the field equations written in terms of the correlations . in the functional integral approach that is nothing but the wick theorem for the gaussian measure . for the fermion fermion correlation",
    "we have : i^^_(0,0 ) = ( - ) + 2^d g^_0(- ) ^3j^_|__(0,0 ) that is not a closed equation , though we can use the  to close it .",
    "take derivatives in and w.r.t .",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 at @xmath104 : we obtain two equations that are equivalent to d g^_0(- ) ^3 ( 0,0)j^_| _ _ = i^_|_^2-_5 + -_5s(- ) + ^i^_|_^2-_5 + -_5i^5s(- ) ( we have abridged the notation of the mass terms in @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "plug into , and obtain the closed equation i^^_s(- ) = ( - ) + 2 i^|_^2-_5 + -_5 s(- ) that is solved by .",
    "there is a subtle point , though .",
    "can be plugged into after the limit of removed cutoff has been removed only if one proves that the limit is continuous at @xmath107 . in section [ s4.3 ]",
    "we will prove in a slightly different way : we will plug the   into the   _ before _ removing the cutoffs , and we will show that the the limit of the remainder is vanishing ( as opposed to the case in @xcite , where the limit of the remainder gives rise to a further anomaly in the closed equation ) .",
    "summarizing , in section [ s4.1 ] we will study the limit of removed cutoffs ; in section [ s4.2 ] we will prove and ; in section we will prove .",
    "as mentioned , from the viewpoint of the formal power series in @xmath15 , the   description of is quite simple . above the meson mass scale ,",
    "i.e. in the uv regime , the coupling of a fermion current with a boson field is superrenormalizable ; below the meson mass scale , i.e. the ir regime , the interaction is renormalizable , and the   flow equals , up to irrelevant terms , the flow of the thirring model .",
    "a qualitative explanation is the following .",
    "at energy @xmath108 , boson and fermion propagators have typical sizes @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively ; then , the energy of a graph with @xmath111 vertexes , @xmath112 external fermion legs and @xmath113 external boson legs is @xmath114 , for @xmath115 : the only relevant graphs are @xmath116 , the uncontracted vertex , and @xmath117 , which is zero by symmetry ; so no renormalization of coupling constants is required . at @xmath118 ,",
    "the size of the boson propagator becomes @xmath119 ; then a graph size is @xmath120 , for @xmath121 , that is the same _ power counting _ of the thirring model .",
    "still qualitatively , the limit @xmath122 gives the schwinger model ; the limit @xmath123 gives the free boson field ; whereas replacing @xmath95 with @xmath124 , and taking the limit @xmath125 give the thirring model .    in this paper",
    "we consider a fixed @xmath126 .",
    "the issue with the above argument is that we are not able to prove the convergence of the perturbation theory with both boson and fermion fields . to overcome that we integrate the boson field before the   analysis so that the fermion - boson interaction is turned into a fermion - fermion quartic interaction .",
    "now the theory looks marginal at any scale . to recover the superrenormalizability of the uv scales we use identities among the feynman graphs : the identities of this paper are the same as in @xcite and @xcite ;",
    "as opposed to approach in @xcite , @xcite , they permit to take advantage of @xmath127 inequalities , which is the key to control an unbounded @xmath128 .",
    "this part is largely inspired to @xcite .    before discussing technical details ,",
    "we set up some more notations .",
    "the explicit choice of generators of the euclidean clifford algebra is @xmath129 then we call @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 - note the opposite notation for the components of the spinors @xmath134 , @xmath22 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 - so that , for @xmath137 , @xmath138 the interaction becomes @xmath139\\;;\\ ] ] and since @xmath140 , also @xmath141 . finally , for @xmath142 , the functional integral formula for the non - local thirring model is e^_l , n(j,)= dp_l , n ( ) \\ { 2_ , dd ^+_,^-_, v_ , (-)^+_,^-_, } \\{_d j_,^+_,^-_, + _ d(^+_,ps . ^-_,",

    "firstly , we are assuming that the limit of removed cutoff in the propagator @xmath144 is already taken : this is not an abuse , since , otherwise , the estimates that will follow would be anyways uniform in the @xmath145 of @xmath144 . secondly , all the claims about @xmath146 ( and the same for other functional integrals that we are about to define ) , must actually be understood in terms of the correlations that it generates , i.e. for a finite number of derivatives w.r.t the external fields , at @xmath147 .",
