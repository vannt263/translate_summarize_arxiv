    "this restricts the possible solutions of the laplace equation to @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are sets of constants .",
    "however , because @xmath154 is a perturbation ( there is no contribution from the zero mode ) , @xmath158 as required from the consistency of the perturbative expansion .",
    "this is also the reason why the first order perturbation of the hamiltonian is vanishing , @xmath159 .",
    "condition ( [ condition ] ) implies @xmath160 and @xmath161 , which leads to @xmath162 .",
    "this shows that our gauge invariant variable @xmath154 is identically equal to zero in absence of vector matter , in agreement with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "this can also be proved by expanding @xmath154 into fourier modes .    in order to have non - vanishing ( physical ) vector modes",

    "if @xmath167 then @xmath168 so physical vector perturbations are expected .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that proving that the formulation remains anomaly - free in presence of the vector matter remains an open issue .",

    "the same holds for tensor modes @xcite ( the reasons are the same because @xmath44 and @xmath173 ) . when imposing the anomaly freedom conditions @xmath94 and @xmath100 , equation ( [ vecteqfull ] ) simplifies to @xmath174)}_{= \\frac{1}{\\bar{p } } \\frac{d \\bar{p}}{d\\eta }   } \\mathfrak{s}^i_a = 0 , \\label{vectoreq}\\ ] ] with fully determined coefficients",
    "of course without vector mater , as discussed above , the variable @xmath175 is equal to zero and the equation ( [ vectoreq ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "however , the presence on a non - vanishing contribution from @xmath166 allows for non - trivial solutions of equation ( [ vectoreq ] ) .",
    "in such a case , equation ( [ vectoreq ] ) leads to : @xmath176 for a symmetric bounce driven by a free scalar field : @xmath177 the evolution is smooth through the bounce .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations grows during the contraction and decreases in the expanding phase .",
    "the maximum amplitude is reached at the transition point ( bounce ) . moreover ,",
    "this evolution is independent on the length of the considered mode , as can be seen by performing a fourier transform of the function @xmath154 . because of this , there is significant difference with respect to tensor and scalar perturbations . for the scalar and tensor perturbations ,",
    "the evolution is different depending on whether the mode length is shorter or longer that the hubble horizon .",
    "in particular , on super - horizon scales , the amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations is _ frozen_. in contrast , for the vector modes there is no such effect .",
    "therefore , in an expanding universe , the amplitude of vector modes decreases with respect to the super - horizon tensor and scalar perturbations .",
    "the contribution from vector modes becomes negligible during the expansion phase .",
    "however , the situation reverses in the contracting phase , before the bounce .",
    "then , the amplitude of the vector perturbations grows with respect to the super - horizon tensor and scalar perturbations .",
    "therefore , on very large scales the vector perturbations can play an important role , _",
    "e.g. _ leading to the generation of large scale magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this could lead to a new tool to explore physics of the ( very ) early universe .",
    "in this paper we have studied the issue of anomaly cancellation for vector modes with holonomy corrections in lqc .",
    "our strategy is based on the introduction of counter - terms in the holonomy - corrected hamiltonian constraint . in our study , we have also introduced possible holonomy corrections to the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "we have shown , first , that the anomaly cancellation can not be achieved without counter - terms .",
    "holonomy corrections to the diffeomorphism constraint do not help significantly to fulfill the anomaly freedom conditions , that are anyway satisfied up to the fourth order in the canonical variable @xmath21 .",
    "then , we have studied the anomaly issue for the gravitational sector with two counter terms .",
    "we have shown that the conditions of anomaly freedom can be met with at least one non - vanishing counter - term .",
    "the resulting effective holonomy corrections are almost periodic functions only if the diffeomorphism constraint is holonomy corrected .",
    "subsequently , we have investigated the issue of anomaly cancellation when a matter scalar field is added . in this case , the closure conditions are more restrictive and fully determine the form of the resulting hamiltonian constraint .",
    "moreover , this requires that the diffeomorphism constraint holds its classical form , in agreement with lqg expectations .",
    "because of this , the effective holonomy corrections , which take into account contributions from the counter - terms , are no more almost periodic functions .",
    "we have found the gauge invariant variable and the corresponding equation of motion .",
    "the solution to this equation were also given .",
    "we have analyzed this solution for the symmetric bounce model to point out that the vector perturbations smoothly pass through the bounce , where their amplitude reaches its maximum but finite value .",
    "the work performed here for scalar matter should be extended to vector matter to fully address the considered issue .    in @xcite",
