    "brownian motion is a classical continuous - time model describing diffusion of particles in some fluid . besides physics , it has found many real - world applications , like in ecology , medicine , finance and many other fields @xcite .",
    "but in spite of many obvious advantages , the standard brownian diffusion can not model the real time series with apparent constant time periods ( called also trapping events ) , which are often observed in datasets recorded within various fields . therefore a rapid evolution of alternative models is observable in many areas of interest .",
    "especially anomalous diffusion models have found many practical applications .",
    "they were used in variety of physical systems , including charge carrier transport in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , transport in micelles @xcite , intracellular transport @xcite or motion of mrna molecules inside e. coli cells @xcite .",
    "the constant time periods can be also observed in processes corresponding to stock prices or interest rates , so models based on the subordinated processes might be also useful in modeling financial time series , @xcite .",
    "one of the most important issues that arises in the analysis of the subordinated processes is the description of waiting - times that correspond to the periods of constant values . finding a proper subordinator distribution allows to conclude on the properties of the whole process .",
    "the most popular subordinator distribution is the inverse @xmath0stable , see for instance @xcite , but recent developments in this area indicate that another nonnegative infinitely divisible distribution can be also used to model the observed waiting - times , @xcite . the family of such distributions contains , besides one - sided lvy stable , also pareto , gamma , mittag - leffler or tempered stable .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the subordinated brownian motion with three types of the inverse subordinator distribution , namely @xmath0stable , tempered stable and gamma .",
    "we show the differences between the distributions and present the main properties of the analyzed subordinated processes mainly expressed in the language of moments .",
    "moreover , we investigate the asymptotics of the mean squared displacement and show that in the gamma case it is linear for large @xmath1 , while for small @xmath1 it exhibits non - power law behavior .",
    "we start with introducing a general definition of the considered processes . the subordinated brownian",
    "motion is defined as @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the brownian motion and @xmath4 is an inverse subordinator of @xmath5 @xcite , i.e. : @xmath6 for increasing lvy process @xmath5 with the laplace transform given by : @xmath7 the function @xmath8 is called the lvy exponent and can be written in the following form @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the drift parameter . if for simplicity , following @xcite , we assume @xmath11 , then @xmath12 is an appropriate lvy measure .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are assumed to be independent .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the process @xmath15 is characterized by the generalized fokker - planck equation @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dirac delta in point @xmath18 and @xmath19 - an integro - differential operator defined as : @xmath20 the function @xmath21 is called the memory kernel and is defined via its laplace transform , @xcite : @xmath22",
    "the classical anomalous diffusion type model given by the subordinated brownian motion ( [ sub1 ] ) defines subordinator @xmath14 as an inverse @xmath23-stable process , see for instance @xcite .",
    "it implies that the lengths of the constant time periods are @xmath23-stable distributed .",
    "however , in some applications also different distributions describing the lengths of the constant time periods might be useful . in this paper , besides @xmath23-stable , we consider two other cases of subordinator distribution , namely tempered stable @xmath24 and gamma @xmath25 .",
    "we start with a brief review of the main properties of the considered distributions .",
    "since there is no closed form for the probability density function of the @xmath23-stable distribution , it is usually more conveniently defined by it s characteristic function , given by @xmath26+i\\mu t \\right\\ } & \\mbox { if } \\alpha\\neq 1,\\\\ \\exp\\left\\{-\\sigma|t|\\left [ 1+i\\beta \\mbox{sign}(t ) \\frac{2}{\\pi } \\ln|t|",

    "note that if @xmath31 and @xmath32 the stable distribution becomes totally ( right ) skewed . since the subordinator should be a non - decreasing process , in the following we assume @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , for simplicity we assume @xmath34 .",
    "recall , that the @xmath0stable family has two important properties .",
    "first , a sum of two independent @xmath23-stable random variables with the same @xmath23 parameter is again @xmath23-stable distributed .",
    "second , the tails of the stable distribution are governed by the power law behavior .",
    "the positive tempered stable random variable @xmath35 with parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 is defined through the laplace transform @xmath38 in the above definition @xmath39 is the tempering parameter , while @xmath23 and @xmath37 are the stability and scale parameters , respectively .",
    "observe that if @xmath40 , then the random variable @xmath35 becomes simply @xmath0stable with the scale parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath42 of the tempered stable distribution with parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be expressed in the following form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the pdf of the @xmath23-stable distribution with the stability index @xmath23 , scale parameter @xmath46 , skewness @xmath47 and shift @xmath48 , @xcite . because all moments of the tempered stable distribution are finite , it becomes attractive in many practical applications for instance in finance @xcite , biology @xcite and physics like anomalous diffusion , relaxation phenomena @xcite , turbulence @xcite or plasma physics @xcite , see also @xcite .",

    "in this section we examine the subordinated brownian motion defined in ( [ sub1 ] ) with three types of subordinator distribution , namely : @xmath0stable , tempered stable and gamma .",
    "the @xmath23-stable subordinator @xmath59 is a non - decreasing lvy process with the lvy measure @xmath60 and the following laplace transform : @xmath61 therefore the function @xmath62 , that appears in ( [ psi ] ) , takes the form @xmath63 this implicates the form of the memory kernel , namely @xmath64 the first two moments of the subordinated brownian motion defined in ( [ sub1 ] ) in the @xmath23-stable case are given by @xcite : @xmath65 while the covariance function takes the form @xmath66      the tempered - stable subordinator @xmath67 is a lvy process with tempered stable increments ( i.e.  with the lvy measure @xmath68 ) and the laplace transform given by : @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "let us point out that in case @xmath72 the operator @xmath19 is proportional to the fractional riemann - liouville derivative , therefore ( [ pdf ] ) tends to fractional fokker - planck equation ( see subsection @xmath23-stable case ) , @xcite .",
    "the basic properties and the simulation procedure of the process @xmath73 defined in ( [ sub1 ] ) in the tempered stable case one can find in @xcite .    observe that the memory kernel @xmath21 in the considered case can be calculated on the basis of the following equation @xmath74 as a consequence , the memory kernel @xmath21 takes the form : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a generalized mittag - leffler function , @xcite .",
    "since for @xmath71 and @xmath77 , the generalized mittag - leffler function for @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be expressed as ( see theorem 2.3 in @xcite ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 the memory kernel @xmath21 is given by the following formula : @xmath82 therefore we have @xmath83 the above limiting behavior is a simple consequence of the fact that for large @xmath1 the generalized mittag - leffler function can be written as @xcite : @xmath84    knowing the form of the memory kernel we can calculate the basic statistics of the process @xmath73 such as moments and autocovariance function ( see theorem 1 in @xcite ) , namely @xmath85 and @xmath86 however , in case of the tempered stable distribution such derivations require numerical approximations .",
    "the gamma subordinator @xmath87 is a lvy process with independent gamma distributed increments , i.e.  with the lvy measure @xmath88 ) and the laplace transform given by : @xmath89 observe that in this case also the one - dimensional density @xmath90 of the process @xmath91 is given in a closed form , namely @xmath92 in this case the lvy exponent @xmath8 is given by : @xmath93 what implicates that the memory kernel @xmath21 can be expressed as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the inverse laplace transform of the @xmath96 function . in order to find a formula for the memory kernel @xmath21",
