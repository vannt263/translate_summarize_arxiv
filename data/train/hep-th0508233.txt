    "the classical dynamics of non - abelian gauge theories is known to be chaotic in a large part of its phase space @xcite . by itself",
    "this is not unexpected since chaos is far more the rule than the exception in nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "perhaps more surprising , however , is the mounting evidence for this chaotic behavior , which is strictly speaking a classical phenomenon , to be of relevance for physical quantum gauge theories as well .",
    "part of the existing indications for the chaoticity of non - abelian gauge theories stem from `` homogeneous approximations '' which neglect all spatial variations of the fields .",
    "although these drastic reductions of the dynamics access only a tiny and not generally physical  fraction of the full phase space , the few remaining degrees of freedom proved sufficient to establish chaotic regimes first in su@xmath1 yang - mills theory @xcite and later in yang - mills - higgs theory @xcite and chern - simons gauge theory @xcite .",
    "extensive lattice calculations of the time evolution under the full hyperbolic yang - mills equations subsequently showed that spatially inhomogeneous gauge fields not only evolve chaotically , too , but reveal even more complex and qualitatively new phenomena which are of direct physical relevance , for example , in nonequilibrium processes .    between the above two computational extremes ,",
    "i.e. either _ ad hoc _ truncations to only constant fields or the full solution of the classical field equations on the lattice , there exist physically interesting subsystems of the gauge dynamics whose spatially varying fields  typically soliton configurations  and time evolution can be studied without invoking uncontrolled approximations or requiring the solution of partial differential equations . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on a prototypical such system , consisting of two electrically charged magnetic bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopoles @xcite , i.e. dyons , whose nontrivial spatial extension gives rise to crucial properties including the magnetic charge .",
    "nevertheless , the low - energy time evolution of the dyon pair is accurately described by the geodesic approximation which involves just a few collective degrees of freedom , governed by ordinary differential equations .",
    "this geodesic dynamics is one of the best understood examples for classical ( and quantum ) interactions between extended  solutions of physically interesting 3 + 1 dimensional field theories and can be formulated at a rare level of explicitness gm:86,ah:88 . beyond being fascinating in its own",
    "right ( exhibiting e.g. the celebrated scattering angle @xmath2 for head - on collisions ) , it therefore serves as a paradigm for the interactions among many other physically important solitons .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to examine regular and chaotic motion patterns of this system in a representative set of phase space regions .",
    "besides appearing in the electroweak sector of standard model extensions , monopoles and their potentially chaotic interactions may have a crucial function in the context of quark confinement by the strong interactions .",
    "this becomes most explicit in the central role which bps monopoles play in the confinement mechanism of @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite . by condensing in the vacuum , they realize the classic t hooft - mandelstam dual superconductivity scenario @xcite in which color magnetic charges get screened while color electric charges are confined by the dual meiner effect",
    ". similar scenarios , in which the condensation of monopole - like objects plays a key role , are expected to unfold in more physical gauge theories as well . in 3 + 1 dimensional yang - mills theories , for example",
    ", there is lattice evidence for the condensation of abelian - projected monopoles to generate the bulk of the string tension @xcite .",
    "( according to an interesting recent suggestion , the `` active '' monopoles might actually be bps dyon constituents of caloron solutions with nontrivial holonomy @xcite . )",
    "hence monopoles may be instrumental in resolving the most profound remaining mystery of qcd , i.e. the quark confinement mechanism @xcite .    from a seemingly different but actually related perspective",
    ", quark confinement is expected to be linked to the chaotic behavior of classical chromodynamics as well . in fact",
    ", it has long been conjectured that the vacuum of non - abelian gauge theories , when undergoing a transition from weakly to strongly coupled fields , also undergoes an order - disorder transition and that the strongly coupled qcd vacuum is populated by highly irregular color field configurations @xcite . in the limit of a large number of colors , in particular ,",
    "a vacuum made of random yang - mills fields has been shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for quark confinement @xcite . from the outset ,",
    "one of the motivations for investigating chaos in non - abelian gauge theories was therefore to shed light on its potential role in the confinement mechanism @xcite .",
    "moreover , the instability of constant color - magnetic vacuum fields sav77 made it natural to conjecture that both gauge invariance and stability of the physical vacuum may be restored by disordering the color - magnetic background fields . under the gluonic structures envisioned to carry the bulk of this disorder are random domains as well as populations of randomly distributed center vortices or monopoles .",
    "the last of these scenarios may be related to the subject of our investigation .",
    "indeed , it is tempting to speculate that a disordered ensemble of monopoles ( and antimonopoles )  in a semiclassical vacuum may be generated by chaotic low - energy interactions among the monopoles . in the following we are going to investigate precisely this type of interaction in the simplest possible setting , i.e. between just two bps monopoles .",
    "one may then hope that the quantitative understanding of its chaotic regime will lead to new insights into the disorder of interacting monopole ensembles as well .",
    "for sufficiently dilute systems , expansions in the monopole density and more sophisticated many - body techniques might even provide a starting point for the quantitative treatment of chaotic multimonopole ensembles .",
    "alternatively , one could contemplate the technically challenging extension of the geodesic approximation to approximate bps multimonopole - multiantimonopole solutions which incorporate multimonopole interactions .",
    "yang - mills caloron solutions with nontrivial holonomy @xcite .",
    "( in the case of su@xmath4 , they contain a bps monopole - antimonopole pair . ) ]    based on the above motivations , our main objective in the following will be to deepen the qualitative and quantitative understanding of quasiperiodicity and chaos in the geodesic motion of two bps dyons .",
    "the pioneering numerical studies of this motion in refs .",
    "@xcite already provided several indications for its nonintegrability .",
    "( evidence for chaotic fluctuations around single monopoles in su@xmath1 yang - mills - higgs theory exists as well @xcite , although not too large , minimally spherically symmetric excitations remain regular @xcite . ) after a brief recollection of the classical two - dyon dynamics at low energies , we will first extend previous studies by examining poincar sections for a set of numerically generated long - time trajectories of the dyon pair . in the subsequent sections we break new ground by invoking high - resolution power spectra and maximal lyapunov exponents to analyze the dyon orbits further .",
    "this analysis will go beyond the mere identification of standard motion patterns and provide the first quantitative characterizations of quasiperiodic and chaotic two - dyon trajectories .",
    "in order to set the stage for our investigation , we first recapitulate some pertinent aspects of the dynamics of a classical bps dyon pair at low energies and discuss its known constants of the motion .",
    "readers interested in more detail are referred to the lucid discussion by gibbons and manton @xcite .",
    "we consider yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory in 3 + 1 dimensions with gauge group su(@xmath0 ) and the higgs field in the adjoint representation , i.e. the georgi - glashow model .",
    "the classical field equations admit topological soliton solutions which are magnetic monopoles with integer magnetic charge @xmath5 @xcite . in the following",
    "we will be interested in these monopole solutions in the bps limit of vanishing higgs potential @xcite , which solve the more restrictive bogomolnyi equation @xcite @xmath6(where @xmath7 is the field strength tensor of the gauge field @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the ( adjoint ) higgs field ) .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ beq ] ) are the absolute minima of the ymh energy in their topological charge sector and form a submanifold @xmath10 in the space of gauge - inequivalent finite - energy fields .",
    "static multimonopole solutions ( with @xmath11 ) of eq .",
    "( [ beq ] ) are possible because the repulsive magnetic forces between the individual monopoles are counterbalanced by the attractive forces which the massless higgs field mediates @xcite .",
    "although the underlying ymh dynamics is not directly embedded in the standard model , it appears naturally in grand - unified theories .",
    "monopole solutions similar to the bps prototype might therefore be physical .",
    "their mass would probably be large enough to explain why they have so far escaped discovery in earthbound laboratories .",
    "the monopole solutions come in families whose members are characterized by continuous collective coordinates or `` moduli '' @xmath12 .",
    "( for the one - monopole solution , for example , these are the three position coordinates of the center and an overall phase angle . )",
    "hence the moduli space spanned by the collective coordinates  is just the ( generally curved ) manifold @xmath10 .",
    "its metric @xmath13 is induced by the metric on the more comprehensive space of all finite - energy field configurations which the kinetic terms in the ymh lagrangian define .",
    "the time evolution of a nonstatic and therefore in general electrically charged bps monopole system is governed by the hyperbolic partial differential ymh equations whose quantitative analysis and solution poses rather formidable problems .",
    "reassuringly , however , the low - energy dynamics of bps dyons reduces to a much more tractable problem as long as manton s geodesic approximation @xcite can be invoked .",
    "the latter rests on the observation that energy conservation forces the low - energy motion of the @xmath5-dyon system ( with sufficiently small initial velocities of the collective coordinates , tangent to @xmath10 ) to remain close to one of the static bps solutions on @xmath10 at all times .",
    "this is simply because @xmath10 contains all absolute ymh energy minima with magnetic charge @xmath5 , so that moving out of it would cost both kinetic and potential energy .",
    "hence the low - energy motion of a @xmath5-dyon system approximately corresponds to low - energy motion of an associated point on the moduli space @xmath10 .",
    "since the energy of all static @xmath5-monopole solutions is degenerate , i.e. at the same ( minimal ) potential , furthermore , the low - energy motion is approximately determined by the kinetic energy alone .",
    "hence it corresponds to _ geodesic _ motion on the moduli space @xmath10 , which is governed by the purely kinetic lagrangian@xmath14where @xmath15 is the reduced mass of the dyons .",
    "physically , this just means that at small velocities ( compared to the velocity of light ) internal excitations ( vibrations ) and deexcitations ( radiation ) can be neglected , i.e. the dyons adapt adiabatically to their interactions by deforming reversibly and scattering elastically .",
    "( corrections to the geodesic approximation were analyzed in an effective field theory framework in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    in the following , we will focus on the two - dyon system . because of the product structure of the moduli space , its center of mass momentum and an overall phase ( whose time dependence is associated with the total electric charge ) are individually conserved , and their metric is flat .",
    "hence those degrees of freedom decouple from the internal motion and can be separated out .",
    "the remaining dynamics simplifies to the geodesic motion in the four - dimensional internal part @xmath16 of the moduli space and can be studied independently .",
    "a physically intuitive coordinate system on @xmath16 consists of the euler angles @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which determine the orientation of the two - dyon system , and @xmath18 specify the direction of the axis connecting the two monopoles , and @xmath19 corresponds to rotations around this axis .",
    "the angle @xmath19 becomes relevant since the bps monopole pair is in general not axially symmetric .",
    "] and the distance variable @xmath20 which measures the separation between the two dyon centers ( at large @xmath20 ) .",
    "although the metric on @xmath16 is induced by the su@xmath1 ymh dynamics , its direct derivation from the kinetic terms of the ymh lagrangian seems out of reach .",
    "instead , it has been constructed on the basis of ingenious symmetry arguments by atiyah and hitchin ( ah ) @xcite , as summarized in appendix [ ahm ] .",
    "specialization of eq .",
    "( [ geom ] ) to the ah metric then determines the geodesic dynamics of the dyon pair explicitly .",
    "the resulting lagrangian@xmath21 \\label{lah}\\]]turns out to be nonlinear since the ah metric is curved .",
    "the functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the separation @xmath20 are given in appendix [ ahm ] and the @xmath26 are angular velocities of the monopole ( or dyon ) pair around the axes of the body - fixed frame,@xmath27the form of the lagrangian ( [ lah ] ) is analogous to that of a nonrigid body with distance - dependent `` moments of inertia '' @xmath28 and @xmath29 around the body - fixed axes .",
    "following gibbons and manton , we define the radial coordinate @xmath20 by choosing @xmath30 which leads to convenient expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath24 @xcite . in appendix eiom ,",
    "the four euler - lagrange equations of the geodesic motion are derived by variation of eq .",
    "( [ lah ] ) .    for the question of integrability versus chaos , the number of integrals of the motion plays a decisive role .",
    "in fact , a motion is ( liouville ) integrable only if the number of independent conserved quantities ( whose mutual poisson brackets vanish ) at least matches the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for the geodesic dynamics ( [ lah ] ) , three constants of the motion are known explicitly ( cf .",
    "appendix [ ioms ] ) , namely , the total angular momentum@xmath32(where the @xmath33 are generalized momenta canonically conjugate to the coordinates @xmath34 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ps ] ) of appendix eiom ) , the energy ( [ h ] ) which , for geodesic motion , equals the lagrangian since the potential on @xmath16 vanishes,@xmath35and , finally , the generalized momentum @xmath36 conjugate to the coordinate @xmath18 which is cyclic , i.e. does not appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ lah ] ) .",
    "at least one additional , independent constant of the motion is therefore required for the two - dyon motion to become integrable .",
    "such a fourth conserved quantity indeed exists ( to arbitrarily good approximation ) in at least one region of phase space , namely , where the two dyons remain infinitely separated . since they can not exchange electric charge then , the time evolution of each of their phases  or , equivalently , their _ individual _ electric charge is conserved .",
    "hence the motion of two far separated dyons must be integrable , as intuitively expected , and can not exhibit chaos .",
    "( at asymptotic distances the ah metric reduces to the euclidean taub - nut metric whose geodesic motion is indeed known to be integrable @xcite . )    this situation changes , however , if the two dyons begin to approach each other . only their total charge , but not their charge ratio , remains conserved since the dyons are then able to exchange charge through the higgs field .",
    "( even when starting asymptotically with two uncharged monopoles , one will therefore generally end up with two dyons of opposite but nonvanishing charge . )",
    "if the integral of the motion associated with the relative phase ceases to exist , chaotic motion becomes possible .",
    "it is this region of the phase space in which we will be particularly interested below .",
    "the above observations raise the question for which orbits the violation of individual charge conservation can typically be considered as a small perturbation away from the integrable taub - nut limit . in our context , this question is of relevance because for such orbits the transition from integrable to  chaotic motion will be delayed and potentially obscured by the implications of kam theory . indeed , the kam theorem @xcite states that almost all invariant tori of the unperturbed taub - nut motion will remain intact during sufficiently small deviations from the @xmath37 limit . ) in its sufficiently weakly nonintegrable realms , has been established in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown to form a set with positive lebesgue measure . ] under weakly nonintegrable perturbations the motion should therefore stay quasiperiodic for almost all initial conditions .",
    "chaotic motion will then be restricted to the small set of trajectories which lie on the descendants of invariant tori with commensurate frequencies .    although we have argued above that it is unlikely for the geodesic ah motion to be integrable outside of the asymptotic region , the existence of additional but so far undiscovered constants of the motion",
    "can not be excluded _ a priori _ since no general method for finding _ all _ conserved quantities of a nonlinear dynamical system is available .",
    "hence it was an important step by temple - raston and alexander to gather the first numerical evidence for the existence of chaotic regions in the two - dyon phase space @xcite .",
    "in the next section , we will elaborate on part of these results by extending the poincar section analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and by looking for orbits which bear the insignia of chaos .",
    "we begin our search for chaotic regions in the phase space of the dyon pair by analyzing the poincar sections of several typical trajectories .",
    "a  poincar section draws a selective portrait of a given phase space orbit ( over a finite time interval ) which achieves an enormous data reduction by mapping the whole trajectory into a discrete set of points .",
    "this set transparently exhibits characteristic global aspects of the orbit and allows , in particular , a direct visual distinction between orbits which arise from integrable ( or weakly nonintegrable , in the kam sense ) and fully nonintegrable dynamics .",
    "poincar section analyses are most powerful for conservative systems with two degrees of freedom where a transparent graphical interpretation becomes possible . at first glance",
    "one might therefore doubt their utility in the eight - dimensional phase space of the two - dyon problem .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was recognized that a particular canonical transformation turns a second constant of the dyon pair motion ( besides the generalized momentum @xmath36 ) , namely , the total angular momentum squared @xmath38 , into a canonical momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "the transformed hamiltonian becomes independent of the associated canonical variables while @xmath36 and @xmath38 act as fixed `` external '' parameters .",
    "this hamiltonian actually defines a reduced , four - dimensional ( and still symplectic ) phase space in which @xmath36 and @xmath38 are automatically conserved at every point .",
    "energy conservation further constrains all orbits to a three - dimensional hypersurface inside this reduced phase space and thus makes a graphical poincar section analysis feasible .",
    "the poincar section of any given orbit is the set of its intersection points , in a fixed direction , with a suitable two - dimensional plane in phase space . in our case ,",
    "a useful choice @xcite is the @xmath39 plane located at the position @xmath40 which we will adopt throughout .",
    "hence we define the elements of an orbit s poincar section as those points in which it pierces through this plane while @xmath41 changes from positive to negative sign .",
    "one can easily convince oneself that integrable and chaotic motions generate qualitatively different poincar sections .",
    "indeed , the existence of an additional , fourth constant of the motion @xmath42 ( as provided e.g. by @xmath43 for far separated dyons , cf .",
    "appendix [ ioms ] ) would restrict all orbits to a generally two - dimensional submanifold in phase space , namely , the intersection of the two three - dimensional hypersurfaces on which either the energy or @xmath42 have fixed values .",
    "the dyon - pair motion then becomes ( liouville ) integrable , the submanifold becomes an invariant torus and the orbit s intersection points with the @xmath44 plane sweep out a ( maximally ) one - dimensional curve .",
    "if the system is nonintegrable , on the other hand , no fourth constant of the motion exists and the orbit is only bound to the three - dimensional constant - energy surface ( for strong enough nonintegrability in the kam  sense ) .",
    "its intersection points with the @xmath44 plane can  therefore be more broadly distributed and eventually fill a two - dimensional area , which provides a clear signature for a chaotic dynamical regime .    in order to prepare for the poincar section analysis ,",
    "we have generated twelve representative orbits by numerically integrating the equations of motion ( [ eqn : movf1])([eqn : movf5 ] ) under suitable initial conditions .",
    "region , the dyon - pair orbits can be obtained analytically by perturbation of the asymptotic taub - nut metric and turn out to be conic sections @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be possible to obtain analytical expressions for the poincar sections in this region , too .",
    "since we expect the chaotic regime to develop at smaller @xmath20 values , i.e. outside the range of validity of the ( first - order )  analytical results , however , we will resort to a numerical treatment of all orbits . ]",
    "the latter are provided by specifying initial values for the four coordinates and their time derivatives . in order to facilitate the comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the following five initial conditions , and the form of a sixth , at the initial time @xmath45 : @xmath46as a consequence of eqs .",
    ", the corresponding initial values of the conjugate momenta are @xmath47which implies @xmath48here @xmath49 is the parameter in the reduced hamiltonian which fixes the value of the conserved momentum @xmath36 .",
    "hence only the initial values for @xmath50 and @xmath20 remain to be determined .",
    "if @xmath49 is given , eq .  ( [ m2bis ] ) implies that the initial condition for @xmath50 can be specified by fixing the value of another conserved quantity , namely , the total angular momentum squared @xmath38 . finally , instead of prescribing the initial condition for @xmath20 directly , it is more convenient to use the reparametrization@xmath51(@xmath52 is an elliptic integral , cf .",
    "( [ ke ] ) ) , which maps infinite dyon separation ( @xmath53 ) into @xmath54 , and to specify the initial value of @xmath55 . under the above conditions ( icond1 ) ,",
    "each orbit is therefore uniquely characterized by the values of @xmath55 and two integrals of the motion , @xmath49 and @xmath38 . for the interpretation of the results below it will be helpful to keep in mind that ( at fixed @xmath49 ) the _ initial _ relative electric charge @xmath56 of the two dyons , and therefore their initial coulomb interaction , grows with @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "eq .  ( [ m2bis ] ) )",
    ".    a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm  @xcite was used for the numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "the eqs .",
    "are solved along the way to obtain the values of the ah functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath57 at each @xmath20 .",
    "the length of an integration step was typically @xmath58 and the longest runs contained @xmath59 steps .",
    "the accuracy of the generated orbits was monitored after each time step by calculating the three conserved quantities ( i.e. @xmath60 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the maximal deviations from their fixed values were of the order @xmath61 .",
    "the poincar section of a given orbit is then constructed from those of its points at which @xmath41 vanishes and @xmath62 .",
    "plane by an orbit typically vary .",
    "this is in contrast to stroboscopic studies where one determines the system s output at equal time intervals . ]",
    "since the numerical integration routine generates the orbits only at discrete time steps , the exact intersection points were determined bypolynomial ( lagrange ) interpolation between the two adjacent points on the orbit with opposite signs of @xmath41 .",
    "we will now discuss the poincar sections for twelve orbits which all share the same @xmath49 value , @xmath63 .",
    "we arrange them into three plots , each containing the sections of four orbits with a common value of @xmath38 and initial values @xmath64 of the radial coordinate .",
    "the corresponding initial values for @xmath44 are indicated by a small circle although @xmath65 implies that they do not lie in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "each of the twelve selected orbits describes charged  monopole , i.e. dyon interactions since @xmath66 and eq .",
    "( [ m2bis ] ) imply that the initial value of their momenta @xmath67 , associated with the relative electric charge , is nonzero .",
    "the above initial conditions were chosen to yield a rather representative set of poincar sections similar to those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to both qualitatively confirm the results obtained there and to extend them into neighboring phase space regions .    the first plot , fig .",
    "[ fig : pp01 ] , contains the four poincar sections with the smallest value @xmath68 , i.e. with the weakest initial coulomb attraction between the dyons .",
    "this explains why each of the orbits covers a rather large range of @xmath20 values while the variation of the radial velocities , i.e. the @xmath69 range , is relatively moderate . in three of the sections , furthermore , the two dyons never come closer than their initial distance , and in all four their separation @xmath70 seems to stay well inside the asymptotic region where the relative charge of the dyons becomes ( almost )  time - independent and the motion ( approximately or kam- )  integrable .",
    "this is confirmed by the poincar sections whose points indeed trace a one - dimensional closed curve which , within plot resolution , appears mostly continuous .",
    "poincar sections of this type are generated by superpositions of periodic motions with incommensurate frequencies , i.e. by quasiperiodic orbits .",
    "as discussed above , quasiperiodic behavior indicates that the dynamics is either integrable or at most weakly nonintegrable in the kam sense .    in the next plot ,",
    "[ fig : pp02 ] , we display the analogous poincar sections with a larger value of @xmath71 and therefore with a stronger initial coulomb attraction .",
    "comparison with the sections of fig .",
    "[ fig : pp01 ] shows that the variations in dyon distance are now smaller ( tighter orbits ) while their relative momenta vary more strongly over each of the orbits .",
    "the increased attraction also brings the dyons closer together , their maximal separation now being the initial one for all four orbits .",
    "nevertheless , their minimal separation @xmath72 seems to stay large enough for the motions to remain approximately integrable since all four poincar sections still form one - dimensional , closed curves .",
    "we therefore increase @xmath38 further , to @xmath73 , and plot the corresponding poincar sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp03 ] . clearly , the character of the outermost section differs qualitatively from all those encountered previously . instead of remaining constrained to a curve",
    ", it visibly spreads out into a two - dimensional area of the @xmath74 plane .",
    "hence it corresponds to an aperiodic orbit and strongly suggests that the dynamics has become chaotic .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the fact that the two dyons approach each other the most in this orbit .",
    "their minimal distance @xmath75 , which is about twice the distance of the bolt singularity at @xmath76 , apparently suffices for electric charge exchange by the higgs field to become efficient and hence for @xmath43 to cease being even an approximate integral of the motion .",
    "along the trajectory . for the chaotic orbit",
    "it is indeed much stronger then for all previous ones . ]",
    "this confirms earlier indications for the chaoticity of the geodesic two - dyon dynamics @xcite which were supported by the analysis of similar poincar sections @xcite , julia sets @xcite and escape plots of two - monopole scattering trajectories @xcite .",
    "an additional chaotic orbit , with a still larger value of @xmath38 , will be generated and analyzed in the following sections .",
    "numerical studies of a single chaos indicator are generally not sufficient to establish chaotic behavior with certainty .",
    "inevitable numerical roundoff errors as well as specific features of a system under consideration ( e.g. particular regions of instability )  make it often desirable to probe the character of the motion by several complementary techniques .",
    "typical pitfalls , like the premature misinterpretation of a seemingly irregular but perfectly integrable quasiperiodic motion pattern as chaos , can thereby be avoided .",
    "power spectral analysis has proven particularly useful for the distinction between ( quasi- ) periodic and chaotic time evolution gs:75;cfps:80;lpc:81;bj:87 .",
    "this is because the power spectra of ordered motion ( either periodic or quasiperiodic ) consist of sharp resonance lines which appear at simple harmonics of the base frequency in the periodic case and at any linear combination of all integer multiples of the base frequencies in the quasiperiodic case .",

    "[ psec ] , we have submitted the underlying orbit data to a spectral analysis .",

    "appropriate windowing is used to suppress artificial oscillations due to the discrete data set and the finite time interval ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since the impact of these artifacts decreases with the length of the time interval over which data for @xmath85 are available , we sample the orbits after each of @xmath86 time steps of length @xmath87 which ensures sufficient accuracy for our purposes .",

    "while the high - resolution spectral analysis of the last section has very clearly distinguished quasiperiodic from irregular orbits and determined the type of quasiperiodic behavior and its base frequencies quantitatively , it is much less specific about the properties of the aperiodic motion",

    "although previous work and our results of the last two sections have produced strong evidence for the chaoticity of two - dyon orbits in specific regions of the ( finite @xmath20 ) phase space , it therefore remains desirable to carry the investigation a step further and to obtain a quantitative characterization of the chaotic behavior .",
    "the most fundamental such characterization is provided by the values of positive lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "after a brief and informal introduction to the underlying concepts , we will therefore evaluate the largest of these characteristic exponents for selected dyon pair orbits .",

    "their relevance is obvious : exponentially divergent orbits , corresponding to positive lyapunov exponents and signalling an exponential sensitivity of the time evolution to the initial conditions , are the prototypical signature of chaos . more specifically , under dynamical evolution for a sufficiently long time @xmath107 the deviation between the position of both orbits becomes @xmath108 and the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath109 is defined by relating the deviation norms as @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111for a detailed and rigorous treatment of lyapunov exponents we refer to original work by oseledec @xcite and ruelle @xcite , as well as to the review @xcite .",

    "hence more indirect numerical approaches are called for , and several different ones have been developed over the last decades @xcite . in the following , we will adopt the jacobian method which integrates the equation for the time evolution of the deviation between two initially neighboring orbits , linearizing it anew at each time along the orbits and therefore having to manipulate only the relatively small deviations produced by one time step .",

    "the corresponding hamilton equation , @xmath244 , therefore trivially implies that the total relative energy @xmath240 of the two - dyon system is conserved and furnishes a second integral of the motion .",
    "the third constant of the motion is the square of the ( both frame- and body - fixed ) total angular momentum , @xmath38 , which can be expressed as the sum of the squares of the rescaled body - fixed angular velocities , i.e. @xmath245 .",

    "indeed , in this case the atiyah - hitchin metric simplifies to the euclidean taub - nut metric @xcite and the electric charge density , associated with the canonical momentum @xmath255 , becomes a fourth constant of the motion , i.e. @xmath256 .",

    ", the asymptotic motion of two bps dyons can not be chaotic .",
