    "the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state from a suitable set of measurements is called quantum tomography  @xcite , which is a particularly important method in the study of quantum mechanics and its various applications . since the characterization of the states is the central tasks in quantum - state engineerings and controls , this technique is of great importance in the current quantum information processing . recently ,",
    "many theoretical analysis and experimental demonstrations have been devoted to implement the desirable quantum - state tomographies for , e.g. , the polarization states of photons  @xcite , the electronic states of trapped ions  @xcite , and the solid - state qubits  @xcite , etc .",
    "however , all these tomographic reconstructions are based on the destructively - projective ( dp ) measurements , and thus are very operational - complicated .",
    "this is because that each kind of dp measurements , e.g. , @xmath2 , is required to be performed many times on many copies of the reconstructed state for determining just one of the elements ( e.g. , @xmath3 in the state @xmath4 ) in the density matrix @xmath5 .    besides the usual dp measurements , quantum state",
    "could also be detected by other strategies , typically such as the so - called quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements . basically , qnd measurement is a nondestructive detection , as the measurement - induced back - action noises could be effectively suppressed by repeatedly hiding them in certain observables which are not of interests .",
    "the basic criteria for a qnd measurement is that the repeated measurements of an observable @xmath6 of the same system should yield the identical result .",
    "this means that the measured observable must be commutative with the hamiltonian @xmath7 describing the interaction between the measured system and the detector , i.e. , @xmath8=0 $ ] .",
    "historically , qnd measurement is proposed to explore the fundamental limitations of measurements , and has been demonstrated in various branches of physics , such as in the detection of gravitational waves  @xcite , quantum optics  @xcite , telecommunications  @xcite , and quantum control  @xcite , etc . in recent years , the qnd measurement has also been successfully applied to probe the atomic qubits in the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this technique was extensively used to the circuit qed systems  @xcite for nondestructively reading out the superconducting qubits .",
    "this qnd measurement is implemented by measuring the transmission of the driven microwave signals through a transmission line resonator , which is dispersively coupled to the detected qubits .",
    "this is because that the detected qubits can cause sufficiently large state - dependent shifts of the resonator frequency .",
    "thus by detecting the signals of the shifted frequency of the resonator , the qubit state will be read out . however , the qnd measurements in the above works  @xcite are only utilized to effectively distinguish the different logic states of the detected qubit(s ) , which is ( are ) not prepared initially at their superposed state .",
    "motivated by the above experiments , recently we proposed a new scheme to nondestructively detect the superposition of these logic states by the qnd measurements  @xcite . by taking account of the full quantum correlations between the resonator and dispersively - coupled qubit(s ) , our proposal shows that each detected peak marks one of the logic states and the relative height of such a peak is related to its corresponding superposed probability .",
    "this means that one kind of the qnd measurements can determine all the diagonal elements of the density matrix of the measured quantum state @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , the non - diagonal elements of @xmath9 could be determined by other kinds of qnd measurements by performing the suitable unitary operations to transfer them into the measurable diagonal locations .",
    "therefore , the proposed tomographic reconstructing approach is high efficient for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) qubits , as the number of the kinds of the qnd measurements required is significantly decreased .",
    "for example , to tomographically reconstruct a two - qubit state , the proposed @xmath10-kind qnd measurements are sufficient .",
    "this is significantly simpler than the previous schemes ( requiring @xmath11-kind measurements ) based on either the dps  @xcite or the individual dispersive readouts of the logic states  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii gives our generic model of the transmissions of a driven resonator . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide a detailed analysis of the qnd measurement of a single - qubit state by probing the transmissions of the driven resonator .",
    "next , we show how to use these qnd measurements to tomographically reconstruct an unknown single - qubit state in the experimental circuit - qed system .",
    "the extensions to the two - qubit case are given in sec .",
    "iv , where the advantage of our proposal ( compared with the previous approach based on the dp measurements ) will be explicitly revealed .",
    "the possible generalization to the @xmath0-qubit situation and summarizations of our main results are finally given in sec .",
    "for the detection of the states of the qubits , we investigate the photon transmission of a driven resonator by studying the steady - state properties of the resonator - qubits dynamics . for generality , we consider a cavity - qed system consisting of @xmath0 qubits .",

    "what follows , we begin with the master equation  ( 3 ) to calculate the frequency - dependent transmission of the cavity , which is proportional to the steady - state mean photon number @xmath28 in the cavity . technically , to satisfy the basic criteria for the desirable qnd measurements of the @xmath0-qubit system",

    "the hamiltonian of the simplified system reduces to ( @xmath34 throughout the paper ) @xmath35 after the time - dependent unitary transformation defined by the operator @xmath36 , we get the effective hamiltonian @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the detuning of the cavity from the driving . consequently , we get the master equation for such a driven empty cavity @xmath39 + \\kappa(\\hat{a}\\varrho_0\\hat{a}^\\dagger-\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\varrho_0/2-\\varrho_0\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}/2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the density matrix of the empty cavity .    from the above master equation ,",
    "one can easily obtain the equations of motion for the expectation values of the relevant operators , such as mean photon number inside the cavity @xmath41 :    [ eq : whole ] @xmath42 with @xmath43    the steady - state solution of eq .",

    "certainly , when @xmath21 does not sufficiently match the cavity frequency , no photon penetrates the cavity and thus no transmission is recorded .",

    "in fact , the characterized time of the detection is determined mainly by the decay of the cavity @xmath25 .",
    "such a quantity is about @xmath59 mhz  @xcite , which is obviously larger than @xmath60 mhz  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the time interval of completing a single qnd measurement is about @xmath61ns  @xcite , this is significantly shorter than the lifetime : @xmath62@xmath63s and the decoherence time : @xmath64ns  @xcite .",

    "five cases of the qubit states for @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are shown . for comparison , the empty cavity ( emc ) transmission",
    "is also plotted in black line .",
    "the peak shifts by @xmath69 or @xmath70 correspond to single logic state @xmath71 or @xmath72 . for the superposition states , the double - peak relative heights ( in contrast to the peak height of the empty cavity transmission ) present clearly the superposed probabilities of the two logic states . here",
    ", the parameters are selected as : @xmath73mhz  @xcite.,width=302,height=226 ]    the measured cavity transmission ( normalized to the peak height of the empty cavity transmission ) versus the probe frequency detuning are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "generally , the qubit is assumed to be prepared initially in the state @xmath74 . obviously , when @xmath75 , or @xmath68 , it reduces to the single logic state @xmath72 or @xmath71 .",
    "compared with the empty cavity transmission ( plotted as the dark line in fig .  1 )",
    ", one observes that qubit - resonator coupling leads to a right ( left ) shift of the single peak in the transmission spectrum by a quantity @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , which is dependent of the logic states for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , the shifts of the peaks can be used to mark the logic states of the qubit . however ,",
    "when the qubit is in the superposition of the two logic states , e.g. , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , respectively , we see that the situation is very different from the case for the single logic states . in this case",
    ", the spectrum shows two peaks whose locations coincide with that for the single logic states , but the relative heights of these two peaks correspond clearly to the superposed probabilities , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "this provides an effective approach to directly measure the superposed probabilities of a superposed state .      above investigation",
    "indicates that , partial information of the qubit state , i.e. , the diagonal elements of the relevant density matrix , can be directly obtained by only one kind of the qnd measurements . while , to extract the full information of an unknown qubit state , one should tomographically reconstruct all the elements of its density matrix .",
    "basically , to completely define a @xmath84-dimensional density matrix @xmath9 , one needs to determine @xmath85 real parameters .",
    "therefore , to determine an unknown qubit state , the key point is to identify these parameters by virtue of the tomographic technique .",
    "now we demonstrate how to perform the tomographic construction of an arbitrary single - qubit state @xmath86 , whose density matrix operator reads @xmath87 a more efficient and widely used technique is to parameterize the density matrix @xmath88 on a bloch sphere  @xcite , @xmath89 here , @xmath90 denotes the identity matrix , @xmath91 the pauli matrices , and @xmath92 real parameters .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the single - qubit state , we must identify the three components @xmath93 of the bloch vector @xmath94 . as discussed in the previous section , two diagonal elements @xmath95 and @xmath96 of the density matrix @xmath97 can be directly determined by the two measured occupation probabilities @xmath82 , @xmath83 in the direct qnd measurements .",
    "this means that the parameter @xmath98 can be determined by the relation @xmath99 @xmath100 . to obtain the other two parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", we need to determine the non - diagonal elements . to this end , we perform the single - qubit operations : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , to transfer them to the the relevant diagonal locations , respectively . for example , after the operation @xmath105 , the density matrix @xmath88 is changed to @xmath106 now , performing another kind of qnd measurements the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be measured . consequently , the coefficient @xmath102 can be determined via the relation @xmath109 .",
    "similarly , by performing the quantum operation @xmath110 on the original density matrix @xmath88 , another new density matrix @xmath111 can be obtained and the coefficient @xmath101 can be similarly determined .",
    "note that here the number of the unitary operations required for implementing the quantum state tomography ( based on the qnd measurements ) is the same as the previous approach ( based on the usual dp measurements ) .",
    "thus , for the single - qubit case the complexity of the present approach is the same as that in the previous one .",
    "note that here , as the same as that in the previous approach based on the dp measurements , three kinds of qnd measurements are still required for the present reconstructions .",
    "one is directly applied , another is applied after the @xmath105 operation , and the final one is applied after the @xmath110 operation , thus the efficiency is not enhanced .    the remaining task is to implement the single - qubit operations required above for transferring the non - diagonal elements to the diagonal locations .",
    "we work with a circuit - qed system wherein a superconducting charge qubit is coupled to the fundamental mode of a transmission line resonator  @xcite .",
    "let the qubit work at its degeneracy point and neglect the fast oscillating terms under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , under one displacement transformation , the effective hamiltonian of the resonator plus qubit system can be written as @xmath112 with the detuning of the qubit transition frequency from the drive @xmath113 and the rabi frequency @xmath114 .",
    "next , supposing that this system works in the dispersive regime , i.e. , @xmath115 , after the transformation @xmath116}$ ] , then the above hamiltonian becomes @xmath117 first , if the condition @xmath118 is satisfied , then the hamiltonian ( 19 ) produces a rotation of the qubit about the @xmath119 axis , i.e. , @xmath105 could be generated by choosing the evolution time @xmath120 .",
    "second , if the driving is sufficiently detuned from the qubit and its amplitude is also sufficiently large enough , then another approximate hamiltonian @xmath121 can be obtained by further performing a transformations @xmath122 , with the coefficient @xmath123 , on the hamiltonian ( 19 ) . obviously , the desirable operation @xmath124 can be implemented by the evolution under the hamiltonian ( 20 ) with the duration @xmath125 .",
    "third , the desirable operation @xmath110 could be constructed as : @xmath126 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the durations @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) of the single - qubit operations required above for implementing the desirable tomographies is estimated as @xmath129ps using the experimental parameters : @xmath130mhz  @xcite , and @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "this is significantly less by at least two orders than the qubit decoherence time , which is measured as @xmath132ns  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the required gate operations are accessible and the proposed tomographic reconstructions are experimentally feasible .    as an example , we assume that the three parameters @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 are obtained through the above reconstructions , then the reconstructed state @xmath88 can be written as @xmath136 , whose real @xmath137 and imaginary @xmath138 parts ( i , j=0 , 1 ) are graphically represented in fig .  2 .     for a single - qubit state .",

    "first , we assume that the two - qubit is initially prepared at only one of the four logic states , i.e. , in the generic expression @xmath174 only one of the four probability amplitudes equals @xmath68 , e.g. , @xmath175 , @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 .",
    "3 shows clearly that single peaks reveal the inputs of these four single logic states , and they can also be distinguished by the shifts of the central frequencies of the transmission spectrum . the peaks with frequency shifts : @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 mark the state @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "thus the pulls of the cavity are strongly dependent of the states of the qubits . for these single logic states the heights of the single peaks",

    "the central positions of these peaks locate at the corresponding positions of single logic states @xmath191 , and @xmath192 , respectively . here , the relative heights of the peaks marking the states @xmath183 and @xmath186 are exactly equivalent to the superposed probabilities @xmath165 and @xmath193",
    ". however , the relative heights of the peaks marking the states @xmath184 and @xmath185 deviate from the corresponding superposed probabilities @xmath166 and @xmath188 .",
    "this is because these two peaks are not well distinguished due to the contributions from these two logic states overlap . as a consequence ,",
    "each peak is higher a little than the expected one , i.e. , the superposed probability of the relevant logic state . while , such a situation does not exist for the @xmath183 and @xmath186 peaks ( the relative heights of them equal to the expected ones ) , as they are separated sufficiently far from the others . in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) we modify the relevant parameters such as @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "then we find that each peak of the transmission of the cavity is well separated from the others , and thus its relative height is exactly equal to the expectable superposed probability of the corresponding logic state in the measured two - qubit state .",
    "the two - qubit state tomography is done in the same way as that for the single - qubit state .",
    "the only difference is that now there are @xmath11 real parameters to be determined in the 4-dimensional density matrix operator @xmath194 , and thus more operations are required to transfer the nondiagonal elements in @xmath194 to the diagonal locations .",

    "this is because that the proposed qnd measurements can be directly applied to determine all the diagonal elements of the arbitrary @xmath0-qubit state ; the individual superposed logic states can be inferred from the relevant positions of the measured peaks , and the probabilities of the corresponding computational bases superposed in the measured state could be extracted from the relative heights of the peaks ( when they separate sufficiently from the others ) .",
    "moreover , all the required operations for the tomographic reconstructions can be implemented from the universal set of the logic gates demonstrated .    in summary , we have proposed a scheme to perform the quantum state tomographies by qnd measurements .",
    "differing from the usual tomographies based on the dp measurements , here the qnd measurements are utilized .",
    "since all the diagonal elements of the density matrix of an unknown quantum state can be simultaneously determined by a single kind of qnd measurements , the efficiency of the present tomographic reconstruction is definitely better for more qubits .",
    "specifically , our proposal is demonstrated with the current circuit qed setup with a few charge qubits , and could be generalized to other systems , in principle .",
