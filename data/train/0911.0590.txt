    "functoriality of the residue map is established with respect to a finite extension @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6    in section [ section_reciprocity_for_rings ] we prove the reciprocity law for two - dimensional local rings , justifying our definition of the relative residue map for mixed characteristic fields .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath7 is a characteristic zero , two - dimensional , normal , complete local ring with finite residue field , and fix the ring of integers of a local field @xmath8 .",

    "let us now say a few words about the relation of this work to previous results of others :      a two - dimensional local field is a compete discrete valuation field whose residue field is a local field ( e.g. @xmath35 ) ; for an introduction to such fields , see @xcite . if @xmath7 is a two - dimensional domain , finitely generated over @xmath36 , with field of fractions @xmath0 and @xmath37 is a chain of primes in @xmath7 , then consider the following sequence of localisations and completions : @xmath38 which we now explain in greater detail .",

    "lomadze also develops a higher dimensional relative theory , analogous to osipov s study of a surface over a curve .",
    "given a proper morphism @xmath125 of fibre dimension @xmath126 between noetherian schemes , with the base affine ( the only case we will encounter ) , grothendieck duality @xcite assures us of the existence of a quasi - coherent sheaf @xmath23 , called the ( @xmath127-)dualizing sheaf , together with a homomorphism @xmath128 with the following property : for any quasi - coherent sheaf @xmath129 on @xmath17 , the natural pairing @xmath130 induces an isomorphism of @xmath7-modules @xmath131 this is an elementary form of grothendieck duality , which is typically now understood as a statement about derived categories thanks to @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite provide expositions closer in spirit to the statement we have given .",
    "it is an interesting problem whether grothendieck duality can be made more explicit .",
    "the guiding example is that of a curve over a field which we discussed above , where the trace map @xmath132 may be constructed via residues .",

    "there are very close analogies between certain constructions and results of this paper and those of @xcite ; indeed , in the introduction to @xcite , yekutieli raises the problem of extending his results to schemes over a discrete valuation ring or @xmath45 , and our results provide exactly that . to make this clearer",

    "he concludes that @xmath142 is the sheaf of regular differential forms in the sense of e.  kunz @xcite .    assuming that @xmath17 is generically smooth , then the sheaf of regular differentials is the dualizing sheaf , and the grothendieck trace map may be constructed using residues , the reciprocity law , and adlic spaces , in a similar way to the case of a curve or surface discussed above .",
    "see @xcite and others of yekutieli s papers , e.g. @xcite @xcite .",
    "this work has many connections to i.  fesenko s programme of two - dimensional adlic analysis @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , and is part of the author s attempt to understand the connection between adlic analysis and more familiar methods in algebraic geometry .",
    "two - dimensional adlic analysis aims to generalise the current rich theories of topology , measure , and harmonic analysis which exist for local fields , by which mathematicians study curves and number fields , to dimension two .",
    "in particular , fesenko generalises the tate - iwasawa @xcite @xcite method of studying the zeta function of a global field to dimension two , giving a new approach to the study of the @xmath143-function of an elliptic curve over a global field .",

    "then @xmath146 satisfies the assumptions which we impose on our arithmetic surfaces in this paper .",
    "let @xmath147 be an additive character on the adle group of @xmath15 , and let @xmath148 be a fixed , non - zero differential form . for @xmath149 a point contained in a curve as usual , with @xmath21 sitting over @xmath150 , introduce an additive character @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the relative residue map which we will construct in section [ section_reciprocity_for_surfaces ] .",

    "* proposition ) @xmath156 we are deliberately vague here .",
    "let us just say that we must adjoin archimedean points to @xmath157 and @xmath28 , consider two - dimensional archimedean local fields such as @xmath158 , and define suitable additive characters at these places ; once these have been suitably introduced , this reciprocity law follows from adlic reciprocity for the number field @xmath159 .",
    "the author is thinking about several topics related to this paper which may interest the reader .",
    "let @xmath160 be an arithmetic surface .      in the existing work on explicit grothendieck duality on algebraic varieties using residues , there are three key steps .",
    "firstly one must define suitable local residue maps , either on spaces of differential forms or on local cohomology groups .",
    "secondly , the local residue maps are used to define the dualizing sheaf , and finally the local residue maps must be patched together in some fashion to define grothendieck s trace map on the cohomology of the dualizing sheaf .    in this paper",
    "the first two steps are carried out for arithmetic surfaces .",
    "it should be possible to use our residue maps @xmath161 to construct the trace map @xmath162 and give an explicit adlic proof of grothendieck duality , similar to the existing work for algebraic varieties described above .",
    "this should follow relatively easily from the contents of this paper , and the author hopes to publish it at a later time .",
    "if @xmath28 is horizontal then reciprocity law along @xmath28 does not make sense naively ( in contrast with a vertical curve : see remark [ remark_reciprocity_along_a_vertical_curve ] ) , since the residues @xmath163 belong to different fields as @xmath21 varies across @xmath28 .",
    "of course , this is the familiar problem that @xmath164 is not a relative curve .",
    "as explained in the discussion of fesenko s work above , this is fixed by taking into account the archimedean data .",
    "such results seem to live outside the realm of algebraic geometry , and need to be better understood .",
    "perhaps it is possible to find a global duality result on @xmath17 which incorporates not only grothendieck duality of @xmath17 relative to @xmath157 , but also the arithmetic duality on the base i.e. poisson summation .",
    "such a duality would necessarily incorporate archimedean data and perhaps be most easily expressed adlically .",
    "perhaps it already exists , in the form of fesenko s two - dimensional theta formula @xcite .",
    "we have focused on additive theory , but as we mentioned while discussing osipov s work , there are natural multiplicative analogues .",
    "in fact , the ` multiplicative residue map ' for mixed characteristic two - dimensional local fields has been defined by k.  kato @xcite .",
    "fesenko s work includes an adlic interpretation of the conductors of the special fibres of @xmath146 , but only under the assumption that the reduced part of each fibre is semi - stable ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , remark 2 ) ; similar results surely hold in greater generality and are related to ` conductor @xmath165 discriminant ' formulae @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "moreover , fesenko s two - dimensional theta formula @xcite is an adlic duality which takes into account the interplay between the additive and multiplicative structures .",
    "it is important to understand better its geometric interpretation , at least in the case of an algebraic surface .",
    "perhaps it is also possible to study vanishing cycles @xcite using similar techniques .",
    "if @xmath7 is a ( always commutative ) ring , then we write @xmath166 to denote that @xmath167 is an ideal of @xmath7 ; this notation seems to be common to those educated in oxford , and less familiar to others .",
