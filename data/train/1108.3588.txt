    "given the plethora of composition operations on graphs ( cartesian sum , tensor product , etc . )",
    ", one is naturally led to the question of whether or not there is a sensible notion of the _ inverse _ of a graph .",
    "there is no shortage of possible definitions : a first attempt is to define two graphs to be inverses if they possess inverse adjacency matrices .",
    "this turns out to be overly restrictive , as under this definition only the graphs @xmath0 are invertible , with themselves as their own inverses ( @xcite ) .",
    "a second attempt , motivated by the observation that the eigenvalues of the sum and product of two graphs are the pairwise sums and products of the eigenvalues of the original graphs , is to call a graph @xmath1 invertible if there exists another graph @xmath2 such that for each eigenvalue @xmath3 of @xmath1 , @xmath4 is an eigenvalue of @xmath2 ( with the same multiplicity ) .",
    "this definition too allows some unfortunate phenomena : if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are cospectral and non - isomorphic , then @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( if such graphs exist ) both satisfy the criterion for being inverses to @xmath5 , and we are left with multiple non - isomorphic inverses .",
    "further , there would be no hope of attaining the obviously desirable property that @xmath9 be isomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "it therefore behooves us to strengthen the condition defining the inverse .",
    "we begin by noting that since adjacency matrices are diagonalizable ( being real and symmetric ) , two such matrices are cospectral if and only if they are similar .",
    "the reciprocal eigenvalue condition described above is thus tantamount to asserting that the inverse @xmath10 of the adjacency matrix to @xmath1 is similar to the adjacency matrix of @xmath2 .",
    "a strengthening of the definition comes from a result of godsil ( @xcite ) that under certain conditions on @xmath1 ( described below ) , the inverse adjacency matrix @xmath10 is in fact _",
    "signable _ to a non - negative symmetric integral matrix with zeros on the diagonal , i.e. , to the adjacency matrix of a graph . here",
    "we say @xmath11 is signable to @xmath12 if @xmath11 can be conjugated to @xmath12 by a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are all @xmath13 ( i.e. , by a _ signing matrix _ ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the following definition :    given a graph @xmath1 , we say that a graph @xmath14 is an _",
    "inverse _ of @xmath1 if they possess adjacency matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 such that @xmath16 is signable to @xmath17 .",
    "we then say that @xmath1 is _ invertible _ , and say that @xmath1 is _ simply invertible _ if there exists a simple graph @xmath14 which is an inverse of @xmath1 .",
    "( in particular , we emphasize that a simple graph can be invertible but not simply invertible . )",
    "clearly this stronger condition defining invertibility implies the earlier reciprocal eigenvalue property , and it is thus easy to find non - invertible graphs ",
    "namely , any graph with an eigenvalue of 0 , e.g. , bipartite graphs on an odd number of vertices .",
    "in fact , this is a convenient place to note that for an invertible graph @xmath1 with an inverse @xmath14 , we must have @xmath18 , and so @xmath19 for any invertible graph .",
    "this forces @xmath1 to admit a perfect matching ( or `` 1-factor '' ) , providing fairly compelling evidence that most graphs are not invertible . following godsil and the subsequent literature , we focus on graphs @xmath1 which are bipartite and have a _",
    "unique _ perfect matching @xmath20 . the first significant invertibility result ( @xcite , theorem 2.2 )",
    "gives that a simple graph @xmath1 ( bipartite with a unique perfect matching @xmath20 ) is invertible if the graph @xmath21 obtained by contracting each edge of @xmath20 is bipartite .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to extend results of this form in a variety of different directions .",
    "section 2 contains preliminaries on bipartite graphs with a unique perfect matching , focusing on inversion and extending previously well - known results for simple graphs to the context of multigraphs . in particular , we give a purely graph - theoretic construction of the inverse ( when it exists  see theorem [ gottabe ] ) , which we dub the _ parity closure _ of the graph .",
    "we emphasize a graphical point of view ( as opposed to a poset - theoretical or linear - algebraic one ) , enough so that it is frequently possible to bypass any matrix - inversion calculations and `` eyeball '' both the invertibility and inverse of a given graph .",
    "further , we prove that the construction satisfies the desired properties of an inverse from the introduction ( i.e. , that @xmath22  see theorem [ g++ ] ) . in section 3",
    ", we turn our attention to determining conditions for the inverse to exist .",
    "first , we extend a variety of known results on invertibility to the context of multigraphs , among them the result of godsil mentioned above and a related result of @xcite that a necessary condition for invertibility is the bipartiteness of a certain subgraph @xmath23 of @xmath21 .",
    "continuing , we note that the main result of @xcite gives much more , reducing the question of the invertibility of @xmath1 to the invertibility of a collection of subgraphs ( the `` undirected intervals '' ) of @xmath1 .",
    "their culminating necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility admits some curiosities , however . if @xmath1 is either :    a.   a simply invertible undirected interval graph with bipartite hasse diagram ( figure [ tkfigs ] , left ) ; or b.   a non - invertible interval graph with bipartite hasse diagram all of whose proper sub - undirected intervals are invertible ( figure [ tkfigs ] , right ) ,       [ allunis ] every @xmath24 which is connected and unicyclic as an undirected graph can be constructed in this manner .",
    "let @xmath24 be such a graph , with @xmath20 vertices and a cycle of length @xmath25 .",
    "as above , without loss of generality we assume that the vertices contained in the unique cycle are labelled consecutively , say @xmath26 through @xmath27 . for each vertex @xmath28 in @xmath24",
    ", let @xmath29 $ ] be the set of vertices edge - connected to @xmath28 and for @xmath30 $ ] , let @xmath31 correspond to those edges coming from other vertices in the cycle .",
    "then by connectedness and unicyclicity , the sets @xmath32 and @xmath33 form partitions as in the proposition , and we can follow the construction process in the proof of proposition [ uconst2 ] with adjacency sets @xmath34 and @xmath35 to reconstruct @xmath24 .      if @xmath25 is even , the resulting unicyclic digraph is bipartite , and thus invertible .",
    "the requirement that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 forces @xmath38 and is equivalent to saying the undirected cycle subgraph @xmath39 induced by vertices @xmath40 must contain only one source and one sink vertex ( i.e. , @xmath41 in the language of theorem [ unicycleinvert ] ) , and that these two vertices must be adjacent .",
    "thus , the result follows directly from theorem [ unicycleinvert ] .",
