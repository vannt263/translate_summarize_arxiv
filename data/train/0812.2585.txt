    "the random field ising model ( rfim ) became nowadays one of the most studied problems in the area of disordered magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "from the theoretical point of view @xcite , its simple definition @xcite , together with the richness of physical properties that emerge from its study , represent two main motivations for the investigation of this model . on the other hand ,",
    "a considerable experimental interest @xcite arised after the identification of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field @xcite ; since then , two of the most investigated systems are the compounds @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .    in what concerns the equilibrium phase diagrams of the rfim ,",
    "the effects of different probability - distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the random fields have attracted the attention of many authors , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , among others . at the mean - field level ,",
    "the gaussian pdf yields a continuous ferromagnetic - paramagnetic boundary @xcite , whereas discrete pdfs may lead to elaborate phase diagrams , characterized by a finite - temperature tricritical point followed by a first - order phase transition at low temperatures @xcite , or even fourth - order and critical end points @xcite .",
    "for the short - range - interaction rfim , the existence of a low - temperature first - order phase transition remains a very controversial issue @xcite .    from the experimental point of view ,",
    "one is certainly concerned with physical realizations of the rfim , for which the most commonly known are diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "hence , in the identification of rfims with such real systems @xcite , certain classes of distributions for the random fields , in the corresponding rfim , are more appropriate for a description of diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . in the later systems",
    "one has local variations in the sum of exchange couplings that connect a given site to other sites , leading to local variations of the two - sublattice site magnetizations , and as a consequence , one may have local magnetizations that vary in both sign and magnitude . in the identifications of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets @xcite , the effective random field at a given site is expressed always in terms of quantities that vary in both sign and magnitude : ( i ) the local magnetization @xcite ; ( ii ) two contributions , namely , a first one that assumes only three discrete values , related to the dilution of the system and the uniform external field , and a second one that is proportional to the local magnetization @xcite ; ( iii ) the sum of the exchange couplings associated to this site @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a proper description of diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform field , the corresponding rfims should always be considered in terms of continuous pdfs for the fields .",
    "the compound @xmath7 presents an ising spin - glass behavior for @xmath8 , and is considered as a typical rfim for higher magnetic concentrations . in the rfim regime , it shows some curious behavior and is considered as a candidate for exhibiting multicritical phenomena @xcite .",
    "as an example of this type of effect , one finds a first - order transition turning into a continuous one due to a change in the random fields @xcite ; the concentration at which the first - order transition disappears is estimated to be @xmath9 .",
    "the crossover from first - order to continuous phase transitions has been investigated through different theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "one possible mechanism used to find such a crossover , or even to suppress the first - order transition completely , consists in introducing an additional kind of randomness in the system , e.g. , bond randomness @xcite . by considering randomness in the field only ,",
    "this crossover has been also analyzed through zero - temperature studies , either within mean - field theory @xcite , or numerical simulations on a three - dimensional lattice @xcite . recently",
    "a rfim has been proposed @xcite for which the finite - temperature tricritical point , together with the first - order line , may disappear due to an increase in the field randomness , similarly to what happens with the first - order phase transition in the compound @xmath7 .    however , it is possible that the diluted antiferromagnet @xmath7 , or some other similar compound , may present an even more complicated critical behavior , not yet verified experimentally , to our knowledge .",
    "according to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , one of its contributions for the random fields assumes only the values @xmath10 ( @xmath11 represents the external uniform magnetic field ) ; motivated by this result , a rfim was proposed @xcite with the random fields described in terms of a trimodal distribution .",
    "such a rfim , studied within a mean - field approach through a model defined in the limit of infinite - range interactions , yielded a rich critical behavior with the occurence of first - order phase transitions , tricritical and high - order critical points @xcite at finite temperatures , and even the possibility of two distinct ferromagnetic phases at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "these investigations suggest that @xmath7 may exhibit a rich critical behavior that goes beyond the disappearance of a first - order phase transition observed around @xmath9 .",
    "however , taking into account the above criteria for the identification of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets , one notices that the trimodal distribution does not represent an appropriate choice from the physical point of view .",
    "in fact , in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , a second , contribution for the random fields should be taken into account as well .",
    "therefore , for an adequate theoretical description of @xmath7 , one should consider a rfim defined in terms of a finite - width three - peaked distribution , which could exhibit multicritical behavior , and in addition to that , a crossover from such behavior to continuous phase transitions due to an increase in the field randomness .    for that purpose",
    ", herein we introduce a rfim that consists of an infinite - range - interaction ising ferromagnet in the presence of a triple - gaussian random magnetic field .",
    "this distribution is defined as a superposition of three gaussian distributions with the same width @xmath0 , centered at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with probabilities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the particular case of the rfim in the presence of a trimodal pdf , studied previously @xcite , is recovered in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "we show that the present model is capable of exhibiting a rich multicritical behavior , with phase diagrams displaying one , or even two distinct ferromagnetic phases , continuous and first - order critical frontiers , tricritical points and high - order critical points , at both finite and zero temperatures",
    ". such a variety of phase diagrams may be obtained from this model by varying the parameters of the corresponding pdf , e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath0 : ( i ) variations in @xmath3 ( @xmath0 fixed ) lead to qualitatively distinct multicritical phenomena ; ( ii ) increasing @xmath0 ( @xmath3 fixed ) yields a smearing of an specific type of critical behavior , destroying a possible multicritical phenomena due to an increase in the randomness , representing a very common feature in real systems . in the next section",
    "we define the model , find its free energy and equation for the magnetization , by using the replica approach . in section iii",
    "we present several phase diagrams , characterized by the critical behavior mentioned above .",
    "finally , in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "the infinite - range - interaction ising model in the presence of an external random magnetic field is defined in terms of the hamiltonian    @xmath12    where the sum @xmath13 runs over all distinct pairs of spins @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "we have argued that the random - field ising model defined in terms of a triple - gaussian probability distribution is appropriate for a physical description of some diluted antiferromagnets that in the presence of a uniform external field may exhibit multicritical phenomena .",
