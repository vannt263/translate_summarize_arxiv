    "until today semiconductors present the most important class of functional materials for electronic applications .",
    "their usage in electronic components and the continuous development of new devices keeps on pushing the limits of technology . in almost all such devices the key functionality originates not in the physics of the bulk , but in the peculiarities of interfaces @xcite . yet ,",
    "semiconductor devices have intrinsic limitations : i ) the characteristic length scales are relatively large so that further downscaling ( current state of the art is 7@xmath2 technology ) becomes very unlikely and moore s law is bound to end ; ii ) solely charge degrees of freedom are exploited .",
    "transition metal oxides ( tmo ) on the other hand provide spin , orbital , charge and lattice degrees of freedom @xcite and are therefore viewed as one of the best candidates to replace semiconductors in future electronic device . thanks to an immense progress of epitaxial growth techniques , tm oxides heterostructures",
    "can now be controlled on atomic length scales .",
    "several novel physical phenomena have been discovered in recent years and potential multi - functional devices seem to be realizable@xcite .    in oxide electronics , one of the cornerstone mechanisms in complex heterostructures ( in analogy to semiconductors ) is the alignment of bands at a hetero interface and , driven by the resulting potential gradient , a charge transfer across the interface@xcite .",
    "this mechanism can be seen as intrinsic doping without undesired disorder induced by chemical doping .",
    "consequently , controlling heterostructures with a wide variety and range of experimentally tunable parameters ( e.g. strain , thickness , substrate choice , etc . ) allows to engineer new phases which do not exist in bulk .",
    "it is , hence , obvious that predictive power for the direction and amplitude of charge transfer with rules that are as simple as possible is highly desirable",
    ".    a natural first attempt would be the usage of well established semiconductor rules , such as anderson s or the schottky - mott rule @xcite . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) the vacuum energy levels of the two semiconductors on either side of the heterojunction should be aligned , which rely on the electron affinity ( or work function ) of semiconductors . however , those rules are not suitable for tm oxides , due to the fact that the reduction of the work function to a single value is an approximation that does not hold for tm oxides @xcite .",
    "moreover , the characteristic lengthscales in oxides are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than in semiconductors , and hence certain approximations are no longer justified so that non - trivial microscopic terms need to be taken into account explicitly .    in this paper",
    "we propose a rule that is based on the continuity of states in the tmo s oxygen matrix and which allows for qualitative prediction of band alignment and charge transfer in complex tmo heterostructures .",
    "the oxygen continuity boundary condition allows us to explain and predict the induced charge transfer between the constituents of the heterostructure starting only from energetics of the bulk compounds . in the first part of our report we sketch the underlying driving forces in tmo hetero compounds which are built from perovskites abo@xmath0 with a being the a cation ( e.g. sr or la ) and b as a tm from strongly correlated 3@xmath1 , 4@xmath1 , or strongly spin - orbit coupled 5@xmath1 shell .",
    "we claim that bulk data for the oxygen 2@xmath3 energies @xmath4 of the components can be used for predictions of abo@xmath0/ab@xmath5o@xmath0 interfaces , and prove it by showing quantitative data for a wide range of materials . in the second part of the paper we provide selected examples as a proof of principle , and predictions for possible devices yet to be synthesized .",
    "to reveal general material trends , we first study bulk complex transition metal oxides abo@xmath0 with a cubic perovskite structure ( in the majority of cases a is taken as sr but we also discuss other cases like ca and la ) with b being a 3@xmath1 ( ti - co ) , 4@xmath1(zr - rh ) or 5@xmath1 ( hf - ir ) transition metal element .",
    "the lattice constant is fixed at the optimized value of srtio@xmath0 , @xmath6=3.945 is @xmath6=3.945 , which is about 1@xmath7 larger than the experimental one .",
    "our estimates of effects from strain show that such effects are negligible for the conclusions we draw . ] .",
    "we then use srruo@xmath0 as an example for effects of strain , cation a substitution , structural distortion , and magnetism .",
    "most calculations were carried out for superlattices of ( abo@xmath0)@xmath8/(ab@xmath5o@xmath0)@xmath8 with n=5 and n=1 , in order to estimate possible quantum confinement effects for the latter . moreover , in order to validate the assumption of clean interfaces we performed simulations of a rough interface with a 25@xmath7 cation mixture ( for details see appendix ) .",
    "it turns out that the observed changes are indeed small and will not affect our conclusions . for the study of magnetism in srmno@xmath0 heterostructures",
    ", we take into account an on - site coulomb interaction u@xmath9=2ev and a realistic gdfeo@xmath0-type structural distortion which are considered to be important for a realistic description of the magnetism . in all calculations the atomic positions are fully relaxed .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were performed with the vasp ( vienna ab initio simulation package ) code @xcite using the generalized gradient approximation gga -pbe functional @xcite for electronic exchange and correlation .",
    "we consider that energy separation between transition metal @xmath1 states and oxygen 2@xmath3 states is usually underestimated in the pbe potential , and use the mbj potential @xcite , which is implemented in wien2k @xcite .",
    "we perform wannier projection @xcite of the oxygen @xmath3 bloch states and tm @xmath10 @xmath1 states to obtain an accurate value of the local energy levels @xmath4 and @xmath11 @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and table  [ tableone ] .",
    "be aware that @xmath4 and @xmath11 indicate the local energy terms of @xmath10 and oxygen @xmath3 states respectively and not to the center of gravity for valence or conduction bands ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "they coincide only in the ionic limit , but for finite covalence ( i.e. oxygen - tm hybridization ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 are split apart and the bands have no pure oxygen or tm character anymore .",
    "the values in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] correspond to @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that covalence yields an energy drop of approximately 0.4ev of @xmath4 for all materials listed in the fig .",
    "we have also carefully checked that the projection details such as including @xmath14 orbitals will not change our conclusion .    in order to obtain quantitative estimates for the charge transfer we integrate the electron density below the fermi level ( down to the energy gap between @xmath1 and oxygen @xmath3 states ) projected inside atomic spheres .",
    "the radius of the atomic spheres ( and here is the mentioned ambiguity in the definition ) were chosen to the default values of paw potential in vasp , e.g. 1.2 angstrom for a vanadium atom in srvo@xmath0 . in this way , the integrated electron density of vanadium atom in bulk srvo@xmath0 is 0.75 . considering the formal valence of vanadium to be one d electron",
    ", we then take 0.75 as renormalizing factor which we also apply to the interface case in order to obtain a quantitative value for the charge transfer .",
    "moreover , in order to estimate the sensitivity of such values with respect to the choice of the radius of atomic spheres , we have checked that a 10@xmath7 increase of the radius only induces approximately a 3@xmath7 change of the charge transfer estimated in this way .",
    "hence , the numbers for the charge transfer given in tab .",
    "[ tableone ] have to be taken with some care .",

    "the most relevant states are i ) the empty or partially filled tm @xmath1 states at the fermi energy , it turns out ( from several dft simulations of the material ) that the assumption of a slight @xmath15-type doping ( @xmath16 at the bottom of the conduction band ) is the appropriate choice . ] which are split into @xmath10 and @xmath14 states in cubic perovskites and ii ) the oxygen 2@xmath3 states residing at an energy @xmath4 a few ev below the fermi energy and forming more or less covalent bonds with the tm @xmath1 states . at an interface of two materials with different lattice constants or distortion patterns of an ideal cubic case we typically find a smooth transition where such structural features mutually propagate between the components of the heterostructure @xcite .",
    "a rather natural observation is that such smooth structural transitions in the shared oxygen lattice necessarily demand a continuity of the oxygen states across the interface layers as a boundary condition .",

    "the transferred electron into interfacial and bulk tio2 layers are 0.23@xmath20 and 0.17@xmath20 respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one might start by visualizing the oxygen continuity condition with a very simple sketch we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for an abo@xmath0/ab@xmath5o@xmath0 interface ; later on we will extend our discussion to more general cases with different cations . in a hypothetical two step procedure",
    "the continuity condition would demand that at the interface the oxygen states need to be lined up which , for two materials with different @xmath4 , would result in a mismatch of the fermi energy @xmath16 equivalent to @xmath21 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . since @xmath16 must , however , be constant all through the heterostructure in equilibrium , a charge transfer occurs between the layers which itself creates i ) an electrostatic potential drop @xmath22 across the interface , ii ) rigid band shifts we indicate by @xmath23 , and iii ) a local electrostatic potential drop @xmath24 yielding relative shifts between tm @xmath1 and oxygen @xmath3 .",
    "these three terms counter the original driving potential - see fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "as indicated in this last sketch we end up with a balance of potentials that has to be calculated self consistently . before further formalization ,",
    "let us support this hypothesis by numerical calculations starting with the easiest case of interfacing two band insulators which , in fact , has a one to one correspondence to the band alignment mechanism in semiconductor heterostructures .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the layer dependent density of states for the interface of srtio@xmath0 and srzro@xmath0 simulated in a 5/5 superlattice .",
    "the chemical potential , which is basically free to move inside the gap , is indicated by the dashed black line while the center of mass ( i.e. the onsite energy ) of the oxygen 2@xmath3 states ( dark gray dos ) is shown as a black solid line . in the plots",
    ", we show zro@xmath19 and tio@xmath19 layers directly at the interface as well as the tio@xmath19 bulk - like layer two unit cells further away from the interface . as can be seen",
    ", the alignment of oxygen states across the interface and even in the next tio@xmath19 layer is practically perfect due to the absence of any charge transfer between the insulating layers .",
    "this observation is a first indication of the validity of the backbone hypothesis of the oxygen states continuity .",
    "we note in passing that we have an advantage compared to semiconductor heterostructures where obvious structural and electronic continuity is absent@xcite . in such semiconducting heterojunctions",
    "one might try to employ the anderson s ( or schottky - mott ) rules in order to estimate the band mismatch by the difference of the components electron affinity ( or work function ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that in realistic cases this rules often fails to predict band offsets .",
    "furthermore , a direct extrapolation of this rule to oxides is rather questionable due to the fact that the concept of a compounds work function is invalid as we have shown in a recent study of oxide heterostructure workfunctions@xcite which strongly depend on details of the surface orientation and termination .",
    "in contrast , the oxygen state continuity rule is a much stronger boundary condition and , as we point out in several occasions , its predictions seem to agree well with experimental observation .",
    "now we take one step further and consider srnbo@xmath0 instead of srzro@xmath0 in the same geometry , i.e. a metal with one valence electron in the nb 4@xmath1 shell@xcite , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] - here we see that an initial alignment of oxygen states has lead to electron transfer from nb 4@xmath1- to ti 3@xmath1-states across the interface .",
    "the self consistently determined final position of oxygen states with respect to the fermi level is in agreement with the expectations from our sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "i.e. , the transferred electron has lead to an additional potential @xmath22 in the interface region and changes in the local potentials ( discussed in more detail below ) which eventually leads to a balanced monotonous evolution of the layer dependent energy of oxygen 2@xmath3 states .",
    "let us stress , that in our picture the directions and relative strength of the charge transfer seem to be predictable just by comparison of @xmath25 of the bulk abo@xmath0 .    before providing numerical data and materials calculations to confirm this ,",
    "let us give more formal arguments .",
    "indeed , the concept of band alignments at interfaces is well known and understood in semiconducting @xmath26-junctions @xcite , where one observes charge modulations in the so called  space charge  region of the typical order of @xmath27   . in the @xmath26-junctions two identical semiconductors",
    "are interfaced which , however have a fermi level mismatch due to different , either p- or n - type , kind of doping that is resolved by charge transfer .",
    "yet , in our case there are some crucial differences specific to oxide interfaces : first of all our length - scales are at least one order of magnitude smaller and the variation of the induced potential on the order of a few    prohibits clearly a semiclassical model commonly used for semiconductors .",
    "secondly , we have to consider more microscopic details for the energy balance equation which finally determines @xmath28 .",
    "namely , in addition to @xmath22 ( the only term of relevance for semiconductor @xmath26-junctions ) the charge transfer in oxides induces shifts in the local potentials of the different tm sites which might be disentangled into contributions ( i ) from mutual change of the valence of b and b@xmath5 site @xmath24 yielding relative shifts between tm @xmath1- and oxygen 2@xmath3- states with a sign equal to that of @xmath28 and ii ) from the specific structure of density of states @xmath23 . in summary we can write @xmath29 the terms on the right hand side depend on the transferred charge @xmath28 and we may try to linearize them . for the first term @xmath22 we can assume a plate capacitor model which would yield a potential drop per unit cell of @xmath30 with @xmath1 being the effective distance of charge transfer cross the interface and @xmath31 the dielectric permitivity @xcite .",
    "the second term can be simplified by assuming an approximately constant density of states around fermi level @xmath16 to be @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 the local density of states for b and b@xmath5 sites .",
    "this contribution d can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] to be of the order of up to @xmath36ev .",
    "the last term indicates the change of @xmath37 induced by the charge transfer that modifies the valence of transition metal.the argument for the linearity in @xmath28 of the last term is easily understood by considering a hartree type self energy ( @xmath38 ) so we can assume @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 reflects the change of the energy due to the static single particle mean - field energy that comes from electronic coulomb interaction .",
    "using virtual crystal approximation for srvo@xmath0 allows us to roughly estimate this contribution to be also of the order of @xmath36ev .",
    "hence , assuming the charge transfer of the order of @xmath28 = 1 will lead , different to semiconductors , to non - negligible contributions of d and @xmath40 , since the first term @xmath41 , i.e. the typical length scale , is much smaller in our oxide heterostructures than in semiconductors .",
    "we arrive eventually at a simplified linear relation between @xmath28 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 while also the simplified equation is hardly solvable in a closed form it allows for a remarkable insight and confirmation of our initial idea : the sign and strength of the charge transfer at an interface between two materials , which turns out to be much larger than in semiconductor devices , should be determined by the difference of the respective bulk oxygen 2@xmath3 energies with respect to their fermi level @xmath4 . ) where d will diverge and , hence an infinitesimal @xmath28 leads to finite @xmath44 .",

    "the simple criterion for the direction of the charge transfer at the abo@xmath0/ab@xmath5o@xmath0 interface is that the component with lower @xmath45 will donate electrons to the other one .",
    "additionally we plot data for labo@xmath0 ( dashed line ) for b=3@xmath1 which is used for estimates for abo@xmath0/a@xmath5bo@xmath0 interfaces .",

    "the figure nicely shows clear trends in the series of materials considered :    * within the intra 3@xmath1 , 4@xmath1 , and 5@xmath1 series we observe a monotonous and almost linear increase of @xmath4 of about @xmath47ev within each period . + * within one group we have a monotonous drop in @xmath4 for a given configuration of about @xmath48 ev from 3@xmath1 to 5@xmath1 compounds .",

    "this change is actually closely related to @xmath49 in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] and represents in some way the extreme case where we have changed the nominal charge by 1 .",

    "[ tablefour ] in the appendix .",
    "+    before we turn to the discussion of how these numbers can be used for predictions we need to address the fact that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are all obtained for undistorted cubic unit cells .",
    "the energy scale of the listed material trends is of the order of a few ev and it should be emphasized that certain effects beyond idealized structures will lead to modifications of @xmath4 on energy scales that are non - negligible compared to our reference data .",
    "therefore we have performed calculations for specific cases studying the influence of strain , orthorhombic distortions , and magnetism ( in tab .",
    "[ tablefour ] in the appendix we provide the numerical data for these benchmark cases ) .    starting with strain , we see for the example of srruo@xmath0 , that 1@xmath7 compressive strain will decrease the @xmath4 of clearly non - negligible 0.2ev and realize that this effect can actually be additionally exploited to tune the energetics for the desired effect @xcite .",
    "next , we turn to orthorhombic distortions @xcite in the same material for which we also observe a change of @xmath4 of the order of @xmath52ev compared to the cubic case which is less but still important for a reliable prediction .",
    "finally , let us address the influence of magnetic order for ferromagnetic srruo@xmath0 .",

    "we remark that this issue does not occur in antiferromagnetic ordered structures and also for temperatures higher than the curie temperature . in the fm ordered phase a prediction of the charge transfer by our simplified scheme is not straight forward and becomes questionable if the corresponding energy scales are equal or larger than the @xmath54 in question .",

    "[ fig4 ] can be exploited in order to predict the charge transfer in layered heterostructures composed of the listed materials . starting with the compounds shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ,",
    "i.e. srtio@xmath0 interfaces with sr@xmath50zr , nb@xmath51o@xmath0 we start with the bulk values @xmath55=-4.0ev , @xmath56=-6.23ev , and @xmath57=-6.03ev . for the srtio@xmath0/srzro@xmath0 interface",

    "<S> we propose a new scheme which is built on a continuity condition of valence states originating in the compounds shared network of oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for the prediction of sign and relative amplitude of the intrinsic charge transfer , taking as input only information about the bulk properties of the components . </S>",
    "<S> we support our claims by numerical density functional theory simulations as well as ( where available ) experimental evidence . </S>",
    "<S> specific applications include i ) controlled doping of srtio@xmath0 layers with the use of 4@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 transition metal oxides and ii ) the control of magnetic ordering in manganites through tuned charge transfer . </S>"
