    "understanding the process of runaway beam formation and loss in tokamaks is of great importance , due to the potentially severe damage these electrons may cause in disruptions . in present tokamaks , runaway electrons have energies between a few hundred kev to tens of mev , and in a next - step device like iter , they are projected to reach a maximum energy of up to 100 mev @xcite .",
    "runaway electrons emit synchrotron radiation @xcite , the spectrum of which depends on the velocity - space distribution of the radiating particles .",
    "therefore , the spectrum can be used to obtain information about the departure of the velocity distribution from isotropy and about the energy of the particles .",
    "the emitted radiation can also be an energy loss mechanism @xcite , although in tokamaks this loss is not appreciable unless the electrons have very large energies , above 70 mev @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies of the synchrotron radiation of the energetic population have been done before , either using approximate electron distribution functions or assuming straight magnetic field lines @xcite . in several studies ,",
    "the synchrotron emission from a single particle is used as an approximation for the entire runaway distribution @xcite , using a specific momentum and pitch - angle for the electrons , often identified as the maximum momentum and pitch - angle of the electrons in the runaway beam . in the present work we use an electron distribution function typical of avalanching runaway electron populations in tokamak disruptions . as we will show , taking into account the whole distribution is important , since synchrotron radiation diagnostics based on single particle emission can give misleading results .",
    "furthermore , we will illustrate that synchrotron radiation can be used to detect signs of modification of the electron distribution , which can occur due to for instance wave - particle interaction .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] we give several expressions for the radiated synchrotron power including the effect of field - curvature .",
    "we also discuss the applicability of these expressions in different contexts .",
    "section  [ sec : distribution ] is devoted to the analysis of the synchrotron radiation spectrum from an avalanching runaway electron distribution .",
    "we will describe the parametric dependences on magnetic field , density , temperature , effective charge and electric field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the potential use of synchrotron radiation as a diagnostic .",
    "we also present a comparison between the synchrotron spectrum calculated for the avalanching runaway electron distribution and an experimentally measured synchrotron spectrum from diii - d .",

    "another instance where the synchrotron spectrum from a complete runaway distribution is useful is in investigations of mechanisms that affect the shape of the distribution itself .",
    "one such mechanism is resonant wave - particle interactions , and here we consider their effect on the synchrotron spectrum through a modification of part of the distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anal_ava ] ) .",
    "a runaway distribution is normally strongly peaked around the parallel direction ( @xmath147 ) , i.e. it has a high degree of anisotropy in momentum space ( see for instance fig .  [",
    "fig : contours ] ) .",
    "wave - particle interaction tends to drive the distribution towards isotropy through pitch - angle scattering of electrons with resonant momenta @xcite .",
    "a simple way to simulate the decrease in anisotropy is to introduce a flat profile in part of momentum space , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : modified_distribution ] .",

    "the integration of the normal distribution is taken over the entire @xmath75-range ( @xmath150 $ ] ) .",
    "as the distribution decreases exponentially with decreasing @xmath75 , the contribution from particles with low @xmath75 is very small .",

[ eq : anal_ava ] ) was modified according to the above , with @xmath162 and @xmath163 since this is a typical range where wave - particle interactions manifest @xcite .",
    "the maximum pitch - angle in the modified region was set to @xmath161 ( @xmath164 ) , which is qualitatively consistent with experimental estimates of the maximum runaway pitch - angle @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ mod_vs_normal ] , modified distribution - integrated synchrotron spectra are shown and compared to those of unmodified distributions . from the figure it is clear that there is an appreciable increase in the average emission of the runaways as a result of the modifications to the distribution . again , this increase is related to the pitch - angle dependence of @xmath41 .",
    "the isotropization broadens the distribution in pitch - angle which leads to a higher average emission . due to the difference in the synchrotron spectrum",
    ", the onset of a particle - wave resonance should be detectable .",
    "however , as we have seen before , there are also other changes in plasma parameters that could have a similar effect on the synchrotron emission .",
    "our goal in this exercise is not to explore the parameter space of artificially modified distributions - the modifications introduced above are too crude to lead to quantitative conclusions - but rather to illustrate the sensitivity of the synchrotron spectrum to the details of the runaway distribution .",
    "the analysis here shows that the spectrum from a distribution modified by particle - wave interaction can imply runaway parameters distinctly different from those that are actually present , especially if only a limited part of the spectrum is considered .",
    "failure to include such effects can thus lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the runaway beam properties .",
    "the synchrotron emission spectrum can be an important diagnostic of the runaway electron population . in some previous work",
    ", synchrotron spectra have been interpreted under the assumption that all runaways have the same energy and pitch - angle . in practice , however , runaway electrons have a wide distribution of energies and pitch - angles .",
    "when taking into account the full distribution , the most suitable approximative emission formula may not be the one that has been used in previous work ( @xmath22 ) . instead ,",
    "depending on the major radius of the device and the actual runaway electron distribution , either @xmath41(for large devices ) or @xmath31(for medium - sized devices ) are more suitable .",
    "although the single particle synchrotron emission formulas do not depend on the plasma temperature , effective charge , density or electric field strength , the total synchrotron emission is sensitive to these parameters , as they determine the shape of the runaway distribution .",
    "we have shown that the single - particle emission overestimates the synchrotron emission per particle by orders of magnitude , and the wavelength of the peak emission is shifted to shorter wavelenths compared to the spectrum from an avalanching runaway electron distribution .",
    "we have also illustrated that using the slope of the spectrum for estimating the runaway energy can be misleading , and in general one should calculate the emission from an assumed approximative distribution and iteratively find the maximum runaway energy to fit the synchrotron spectrum . finally , through a comparison with an experimental synchrotron spectrum from diii - d , we have estimated the maximum runaway electron energy in that particular experimental scenario to be around 65 mev .",
