    "sequence of random variables with distribution @xmath4 , and denote by @xmath5 the distribution of a real - valued root @xmath6 under @xmath7 . in statistics and econometrics , it is often of interest to estimate certain quantiles of @xmath5 .",
    "two commonly used methods for this purpose are subsampling and the bootstrap .",
    "this paper provides conditions under which these estimators behave well uniformly over @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we provide conditions under which subsampling and the bootstrap may be used to construct estimators @xmath8 of the @xmath9 quantiles of @xmath5 and @xmath10 of the @xmath11 quantiles of @xmath5 , satisfying @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is understood to be @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is understood to be @xmath16 . for the construction of two - sided confidence intervals of nominal level @xmath17 for a real - valued parameter , we typically would consider @xmath18 , while for a one - sided confidence interval of nominal level @xmath19 we would consider either @xmath20 and @xmath21 , or @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in many cases ,",
    "it is possible to replace the @xmath24 and @xmath25 in ( [ eqtwosided ] ) with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "these results differ from those usually stated in the literature in that they require the convergence to hold uniformly over @xmath0 instead of just pointwise over @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of this stronger notion of convergence when applying these results is discussed further below .",
    "as we will see , the result ( [ eqtwosided ] ) may hold with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but it may fail if @xmath23 and @xmath30 , or the other way round .",
    "this phenomenon arises when it is not possible to estimate @xmath5 uniformly well with respect to a suitable metric , but , in a sense to be made precise by our results , it is possible to estimate it sufficiently well to ensure that ( [ eqtwosided ] ) still holds for certain choices of @xmath9 and @xmath31 . note that metrics compatible with the weak topology are not sufficient for our purposes . in particular , closeness of distributions with respect to such a metric does not ensure closeness of quantiles . see remark  [ remarklevy ] for further discussion of this point .",
    "in fact , closeness of distributions with respect to even stronger metrics , such as the kolmogorov metric , does not ensure closeness of quantiles either .",
    "for this reason , our results rely heavily on lemma  [ lemmaquant ] which relates closeness of distributions with respect to a suitable metric and coverage statements .",
    "in contrast , the usual arguments for the pointwise asymptotic validity of subsampling and the bootstrap rely on showing for each @xmath32 that @xmath33 tends in probability under @xmath7 to the @xmath34 quantile of the limiting distribution of @xmath35 under  @xmath7 . because our results are uniform in @xmath36",
    ", we must consider the behavior of @xmath35 and @xmath33 under arbitrary sequences @xmath37 , under which the quantile estimators need not even settle down .",
    "thus , the results are not trivial extensions of the usual pointwise asymptotic arguments .",
    "the construction of @xmath38 satisfying ( [ eqtwosided ] ) is useful for constructing confidence regions that behave well uniformly over @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , our results provide conditions under which subsampling and the bootstrap can be used to construct confidence regions @xmath39 of level @xmath40 for a parameter @xmath41 that are uniformly consistent in level in the sense that @xmath42 our results are also useful for constructing tests @xmath43 of level @xmath44 for a null hypothesis @xmath45 against the alternative @xmath46 that are uniformly consistent in level in the sense that @xmath47 \\leq\\alpha.\\ ] ] in some cases , it is possible to replace the @xmath48 and @xmath25 in ( [ equnifcr ] ) or the @xmath49 and @xmath50 in ( [ equniftest ] ) with @xmath51 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "confidence regions satisfying ( [ equnifcr ] ) are desirable because they ensure that for every @xmath52 there is an @xmath53 such that for @xmath54 we have that @xmath55 is no less than @xmath56 for all @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , confidence regions that are only pointwise consistent in level in the sense that @xmath57 for each fixed @xmath4 have the feature that there exists some @xmath52 and @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is less than @xmath60 infinitely often .",
    "likewise , tests satisfying ( [ equniftest ] ) are desirable for analogous reasons .",
    "for this reason , inferences based on confidence regions or tests that fail to satisfy ( [ equnifcr ] ) or ( [ equniftest ] ) may be very misleading in finite samples .",
    "of course , as pointed out by @xcite , there may be no nontrivial confidence region or test satisfying ( [ equnifcr ] ) or ( [ equniftest ] ) when @xmath0 is sufficiently rich .",
    "for this reason , we will have to restrict @xmath0 appropriately in our examples .",
    "in the case of confidence regions for or tests about the mean , for instance , we will have to impose a very weak uniform integrability condition .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite , leeb and ptscher ( @xcite ) , @xcite for related results in more complicated settings , including post - model selection , shrinkage - estimators and ill - posed problems .",
    "some of our results on subsampling are closely related to results in @xcite , which were developed independently and at about the same time as our results .",
    "see the discussion on page 431 of @xcite .",
    "our results show that the question of whether subsampling can be used to construct estimators @xmath38 satisfying ( [ eqtwosided ] ) reduces to a single , succinct requirement on the asymptotic relationship between the distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the subsample size , whereas the results of @xcite require the verification of a larger number of conditions .",
    "moreover , we also provide a converse , showing this requirement on the asymptotic relationship between the distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath61 is also necessary in the sense that , if the requirement fails , then for some nominal coverage level , the uniform coverage statements fail .",
    "thus our results are stated under essentially the weakest possible conditions , yet are verifiable in a large class of examples . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of @xcite further provide a means of calculating the limiting value of @xmath63 in the case where it may not satisfy ( [ eqtwosided ] ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our results on the bootstrap are the first to be stated at this level of generality .",
    "an important antecedent is @xcite , who studies the uniform asymptotic behavior of confidence regions for a univariate cumulative distribution function .",
    "see also @xcite , who analyzes the uniform asymptotic behavior of some tests that arise in the context of an autoregressive model .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectiongeneral ]",
    ", we present the conditions under which @xmath64 satisfying ( [ eqtwosided ] ) may be constructed using subsampling or the bootstrap .",
    "we then provide in section [ sectionappl ] several applications of our general results .",
    "these applications include the multivariate mean , testing moment inequalities , multiple testing , the empirical process and @xmath2-statistics .",
    "the discussion of @xmath2-statistics is especially noteworthy because it highlights the fact that the assumptions required for the uniform asymptotic validity of subsampling and the bootstrap may differ .",
    "in particular , subsampling may be uniformly asymptotically valid under conditions where , as noted by @xcite , the bootstrap fails even to be pointwise asymptotically valid .",
    "the application to multiple testing is also noteworthy because , despite the enormous recent literature in this area , our results appear to be the first that provide uniformly asymptotically valid inference .",
    "proofs of the main results ( theorems [ theoremsubsample ] and  [ theoremboot ] ) can be found in the ; proofs of all other results can be found in @xcite , which contains supplementary material .",
    "many of the intermediate results may be of independent interest , including uniform weak laws of large numbers for @xmath2-statistics and @xmath65-statistics [ lemmas s.17.3 and s.17.4 in @xcite , resp .",

    "even though the estimator of @xmath5 defined in ( [ equationsubdist ] ) is infeasible because of its dependence on @xmath7 , which is unknown , it is useful both as an intermediate step toward establishing some results for the feasible estimator of @xmath5 and , as explained in remarks [ remarkinvert ] and  [ remarktesting ] , on its own in the construction of some feasible tests and confidence regions .",
