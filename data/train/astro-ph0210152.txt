    "@xmath1 is particularly sensitive to the adopted properties of dark matter .",
    "if , for example , the dark matter is assumed to be cold and collisionless ( cdm ) , the equilibrium density profiles of the dark halos will have steep inner slopes .",
    "early simulations found @xmath9 ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 , navarro , frenk , & white 1996 , 1997 ) , but later simulations found steeper slopes with @xmath10 ( fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al .",

    "( 2002 ) places an upper limit on the inner slope of @xmath11 , and suggests that the disagreement in the literature on the value of @xmath0 is mainly due to resolution issues in the numerical simulations . if the dark matter is assumed to be warm ( wdm ) , cores with @xmath12 are found ( coln , avila - reese , & valenzuela 2000 ; knebe et al .",
    "2002 ) , and shallower slopes are found for self - interacting dark matter ( sidm , dav et al .",
    "2001 ) . because of these differences in inner slopes it may be possible to obtain limits on the nature of dark matter from the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , it has proved remarkably hard to establish the inner slope of the dark matter distribution observationally .",
    "the inner slope is usually constrained by fitting the observed rotation curves with mass models that contain both the dark and luminous components . however , because the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) of the stellar disk is not known , a large degeneracy exists in the mass modeling ( e.g. , van albada et al .",
    "1985 ; lake & feinswog 1989 ) . as a result",
    ", the observed rotation curves can often be explained by a wide range in mass models , ranging from mass models in which the stellar disk dominates in the inner parts and where the halo has a shallow inner profile ( e.g. , begeman 1987 , 1989 ) , to ones in which the stellar disk is less important and the mass distribution is dominated by a centrally concentrated halo ( e.g. , verheijen 1997 ; navarro 1998 ) .    table [ tabglobpars ] + to    lrrrrrrrrcrrrrc & & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & + ugc 731 & 1 & 10 & 43.6 & 49 & 36 & 4 & -16.6 & 1.65 & 23.0 & 8.0 & 638 & 57 & 77 & barred + ugc 2259 & 2 & 47 & 55.6 & 37 & 32 & 17 & -17.8 & 1.29 & 21.2 & 9.8 & 574 & 41 & 160 & + ugc 4325 & 8 & 19 & 19.7 & 50 & 0 & 32 & -18.1 & 1.63 & 21.6 & 10.1 & 527 & 41 & 53 & + ugc 4499 & 8 & 37 & 41.4 & 51 & 39 & 9 & -17.8 & 1.49 & 21.5 & 13.0 & 693 & 50 & 140 & barred + ugc 5721 & 10 & 32 & 17.3 & 27 & 40 & 8 & -16.6 & 0.45 & 20.2 & 6.7 & 535 & 61 & 96 & + ugc 8490 & 13 & 29 & 36.4 & 58 & 25 & 12 & -17.3 & 0.66 & 20.5 & 4.9 & 208 & 50 & 170 & + ugc 11557 & 20 & 24 & 0.7 & 60 & 11 & 41 & -19.7 & 3.10 & 21.0 & 23.8 & 1388 & 30 & 94 & + ugc 11707 & 21 & 14 & 31.7 & 26 & 44 & 5 & -18.6 & 4.30 & 23.1 & 15.9 & 904 & 68 & 57 & + ugc 11861 & 21 & 56 & 24.2 & 73 & 15 & 39 & -20.8 & 6.06 & 21.4 & 25.1 & 1481 & 50 & 39 & barred + ugc 12732 & 23 & 40 & 39.8 & 26 & 14 & 11 & -18.0 & 2.21 & 22.4 & 13.2 & 749 & 39 & 14 & + f 563-v2 & 8 & 53 & 3.7 & 18 & 26 & 9 & -19.0 & 2.10 & 21.3 & 61 & 4310 & 29 & 148 & barred + f 568 - 1 & 10 & 26 & 6.3 & 22 & 26 & 1 & -18.9 & 4.41 & 22.7 & 85 & 6524 & 26 & 13 & + f 568 - 3 & 10 & 27 & 20.3 & 22 & 14 & 22 & -19.2 & 4.48 & 22.4 & 77 & 5911 & 40 & 169 & barred + f 568-v1 & 10 & 45 & 2.1 & 22 & 3 & 16 & -18.7 & 3.96 & 22.7 & 80 & 5769 & 40 & 136 & + f 574 - 1 & 12 & 38 & 7.1 & 22 & 18 & 50 & -19.2 & 4.24 & 22.2 & 96 & 6889 & 65 & 90 & +    this degeneracy can be partially avoided by studying dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies . even though the central parts of the observed rotation curves can in principle be explained by scaling up the contribution of the stellar disks ( swaters 1999 , hereafter s99 ; swaters , madore , & trewhella 2000 , hereafter smt ) , the inferred stellar m / ls are much higher than expected from population synthesis modeling ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; bell & de jong 2001 ) . for reasonable stellar m / ls , these galaxies are then dominated by dark matter at all radii , making dwarf and lsb galaxies very suitable for studies of the properties of dark matter .    consequently , the rotation curves of these galaxies have received a great deal of attention .",
    "early studies found that these galaxies have slowly rising inner rotation curves and that their halos can be well described by pseudo - isothermal spheres with constant density cores ( e.g. , carignan & beaulieu 1989 ; ct , carignan , & sancisi 1991 ; broeils 1992a , 1992b ; ct 1995 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",

    "recent studies raised the concern that some of these  rotation curves may have been affected by beam smearing due to the poor angular resolution of the  observations , and found that the rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies rise more steeply when beam smearing is taken into account ( s99 ; blais - ouellette et al .",

    "fitting beam - smeared mass models to the  rotation curves indicated that dwarf and lsb galaxies are consistent with a wide range of dark matter properties , ranging from constant density cores to steep cusps with @xmath9 .",

    "= 1.0    observations , however , with typical resolutions of @xmath13 , may not be best suited to determine the inner rotation curve slopes .",

    "high angular resolution observations , for example based on  long slit or fabry - perot spectroscopy seem more suited to measure the inner slopes . yet",
    "even among studies based on such high angular resolution observations a controversy remains . on the one hand , there are studies that find that dwarf and lsb galaxies may have steep inner slopes ( swaters 2001b ; pickering et al . , in preparation ) , and on the other hand there are several studies that find that these galaxies are not consistent with steep inner slopes ( borriello & salucci 2001 ; dalcanton & bernstein 2000 ; blais - ouellette , amram , & carignan 2001 ; de blok et al .",

    "for the dwarf galaxies , the alignment of the slit proved more difficult , because of the diffuse , extended nature of these objects .",
    "the position of the slit was judged in relation to the galaxy image and to stars in the field of view .",
    "the systematic effects that may have been introduced by an incorrectly positioned slit are discussed in section  [ secobseffs ] .",

    "the position of the galaxy center along the slit was determined from the peak in the continuum . for most galaxies",
    "the continua were sufficiently bright and compact that the center could be determined to an accuracy better than @xmath15 .",
    "for a few galaxies for which the continuum was less peaked and/or fainter the position of the center was first estimated from the broad continuum peak and then refined by minimizing the differences between the receding and approaching sides of the rotation curves .",
    "the resulting shifts in the position of the center were at most a few arcseconds .",
    "the systemic velocities were determined at the position of the center and have been corrected to heliocentric velocities . in all cases",
    "they agree with the systemic velocities within the errors .    to determine the rotation curves , the radial velocities as determined from the gaussian fits were folded around the center and systemic velocity .",
    "the velocity points were binned in intervals of @xmath18 ( similar to the angular resolution of our observations ) and averaged both in radius and velocity , weighted with the inverse square of the errors . the final error on each point of the rotation curve",
    "was defined ad hoc as half the quadratic sum of the average error of the points in the bin , weighted by the inverse square of the errors , and half the difference between the minimum and maximum rotation velocity within the bin .",
    "a minimum error of @xmath19 was imposed .",
    "the method to derive the rotation curves as described above is somewhat different from the method used in smt , where the rotation velocity at each interval was estimated by eye , resulting in relatively smooth rotation curves .",
    "we have reanalyzed the smt data with the procedure described above , so that all rotation curves presented in this paper are determined in the same way .",
    "the method used here avoids any bias or artificial smoothness that may have been introduced by determining the rotation curve by eye .    to extend the radial coverage of the rotation curves derived from the  observations , we combined them with the  rotation curves from carignan et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for ugc  2259 , s99 for other dwarf galaxies , and from de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the lsb galaxies . for the lsb galaxies there are systematic differences between the  and  rotation curves , in the sense that the  rotation curves appear to underestimate the rotation velocities in the inner parts ( smt , but see mcgaugh , rubin , & de blok 2001 ) , but the rotation velocities in the outer parts generally agree well .",
    "hence , we replaced the inner parts of the  rotation curves with the data derived here .",
    "the resulting rotation curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ figrcs ]    in principle , the observed rotation curves need to be corrected for the effects of pressure , which may provide part of the support against gravity . however , as discussed in more detail in s99 , these corrections are uncertain and usually small , especially in the galaxy centers",
    ". therefore , we did not correct the observed rotation curves for asymmetric drift and we assumed that the observed rotation curves are a good representation of the circular velocities .",
    "assuming that a galaxy is axially symmetric and in equilibrium , the circular velocity directly reflects the total gravitational potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radial force , @xmath22 the gravitational potential , @xmath23 the galactocentric radius and @xmath24 the circular velocity .",
    "the total gravitational potential is the sum of the gravitational potentials of the individual mass components in a galaxy . here",
    ", we assume that the galaxy consists of three main components : a stellar disk , a gaseous disk , and a spherical dark halo .",
    "its total circular velocity is then given by : @xmath25 where  is the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath26 is the rotation curve of the stellar disk for a stellar mass - to - light ratio of unity , @xmath27 represents the inclusion of the contribution of helium to the gaseous component , assumed to be 1.32 , @xmath28 is the rotation curve of the  only , and @xmath29 represents the dark halo , where @xmath30 to @xmath31 are parameters describing its mass distribution .",

    "is determined by fitting eq .",
    "[ eqfit ] to the observed rotation curve , with and @xmath30 to @xmath31 as free parameters .",
    "the circular velocities due to the stellar disks have been calculated from the observed @xmath6-band luminosity profiles using the method of casertano ( 1983 ) and begeman ( 1987 ) .",
    "for f563-v2 a @xmath32-band light profile was used .",
    "the light profiles for the dwarf galaxies have been taken from swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) , and for the lsb galaxies from de blok , van der hulst , & bothun ( 1995 ) and mcgaugh & bothun ( 1994 ) . throughout",
    "we assume that the stellar disk have a constant mass - to - light ratio and follow a sech@xmath33 vertical density distribution with @xmath34 .",
    "this particular choice for the vertical density distribution has a negligible effect on the resulting rotation curves .",
    "finally , the surface brightness profiles of most of the galaxies in our sample are well described by a pure exponential with little or no central concentration of light , and we therefore did not include a bulge component .",
    "circular velocity contributions from the gas disks have been computed from the radial  surface density profiles presented in swaters et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and de blok et al .",
    "all dwarf galaxies were sufficiently resolved to allow a direct determination of the radial  surface density profile by azimuthally averaging in concentric ellipses .",
    "the lsb galaxies , however , were poorly resolved , and the radial profiles derived in this way may be affected by beam smearing ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ) . to calculate the radial distribution of the  for the lsb galaxies , we have used the algorithm described by warmels ( 1988 ) that uses a iterative deconvolution scheme ( lucy 1974 ) to correct for the effects of beam smearing .",
    "although the resulting density profiles may be very different , the effects on mass modeling are minor because the contribution of the  to the rotation velocity at each radius is usually a modest fraction of the total rotation velocity .",
    "we assumed that the  layer is infinitely thin .",
    "the choice of the vertical distribution has little effect on the resulting rotation curve .",
    "even if the gaseous disk were to have the same thickness as the stellar disk , the difference would still be less than 5% .",
    "we consider two different density profiles for the dark halo : a pseudo - isothermal sphere , and a more general density distribution with variable central cusp slope .",
    "the pseudo - isothermal sphere has frequently been used in the literature to describe the dark halo and is able to explain the observed rotation curves for a wide range of hubble types and a wide range of stellar m / ls ( e.g. , begeman 1987 , 1989 ; broeils 1992a ; de blok & mggaugh 1997 ; verheijen 1997 ; s99 ) .",

    "for @xmath3 the density profile thus has a constant density core and becomes comparable to that of the pseudo - isothermal sphere ( at least at small radii ) , while for @xmath9 it reduces to the nfw profile ( navarro et al .",
    "this ` generalized ' nfw density distribution has previously been used in rotation curve analyses by e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vdbs .",
    "the corresponding circular velocity curve is @xmath44 where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the radius inside of which the mean density is 200 times the critical density for closure , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 the formation of the disk within the halo leads to a contraction of the dark matter component .",
    "we assume that the collapse of the baryons within the dark halo is slow , and correct for adiabatic contraction of the halo following the procedure outlined in barnes & white ( 1984 ) , blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and flores et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . to facilitate a more direct comparison with previous studies , we do not correct for adiabatic contraction when using the pseudo - isothermal density distribution .",
    "even when the effects of beam - smearing are small , a unique decomposition of the observed rcs in terms of its contributions from the stellar disk , the gaseous disk , and the dark matter halo is hampered by uncertainties in the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( the mass - to - light ratio degeneracy , e.g. , van albada et al .",
    "1985 ) and by the limited spatial sampling of the the halo s density distribution ( the cusp - core degeneracy , vdbs ) .",
    "below we address this non - uniqueness in the mass models by examining several extreme cases , and by analyzing the data using different methods .",
    "useful limits on the dark halo properties and the slope of the dark matter density distribution can be obtained by completely ignoring the contribution of the disk ( stars and gas ) , i.e. , by assuming that the dark matter is the only mass component .",

    "the freedom in the inner slope of the dark matter distribution is large , and most galaxies _ individually _ are consistent with mass models with inner slopes in the range @xmath69 .",
    "however , for @xmath70 the quality of the fits decrease rapidly , and inner slopes with @xmath10 are clearly inconsistent with the observations .",
    "previous studies have found that the  and hi rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies are consistent with the picture that all dark matter halos have constant density cores and that pseudo - isothermal halos in general provide better fits to the rotation curves than the cuspy nfw halos .",
    "the results presented in section  [ secresults ] are consistent with these findings .",
    "however , there are various systematic effects that may affect the derived inner slope , such as beam smearing , slit alignment errors , line - of - sight projection effects and non - circular motions .",
    "clearly , such systematic effects need to be considered before intrinsically steep slopes can be ruled out observationally .",
    "the effect of beam smearing is to dilute steep velocity gradients , thus leading to an underestimate of the inner slope in the derived rotation curves .",
    "previous attempts to constrain the central mass density of lsb galaxies using hi rotation curves with a typical resolution of @xmath13 to @xmath71 suffered strongly from beam smearing effects .",
    "the  observations presented here have a much higher spatial resolution , of about @xmath15 to @xmath18 , and    clearly beam smearing will play a less dramatic role",
    ". however , the measurement of the inner slope usually depends on the very inner points of the rotation curves , and hence beam smearing as a result of seeing still needs to be considered , especially for galaxies at large distances .      for a larger slit width , a larger fraction of the velocity field is encompassed by the slit .",
    "the projected rotation velocities away from the major axis are lower than those on the major axis , especially near the center of the galaxy .",
    "this skews the observed line profile toward lower rotation velocities , and hence a wide slit may lead to an underestimate of the inner slope .",
    "a misalignment of the slit may happen either in position or in position angle .",
    "the latter is likely to be negligible , both because position angles can usually be measured accurately , and because even large errors in position angle will still only have a small effect on the rotation curve .",
    "a much more important effect is an offset between the position of the slit and the center of the galaxy . as a result of such an offset ,",
    "the steepest gradient in the velocity field will be missed , resulting in an underestimate of the inner slope .",
    "there are three main reasons for offsets : observational errors , uncertainties in the position of the galaxy centers , and differences between the kinematic and optical centers .",
    "the observational errors depend on the method used to align the slit with the galaxy image . here , we have aligned the slit visually , because most galaxies were clearly visible on the slit viewing camera . for the lsb galaxies , we estimate that we could align the slit with an accuracy of around @xmath15 . for the dwarf galaxies the alignment was more difficult ,",
    "because of their diffuse and extended nature , and the error in the alignment will likely be larger . a better method to position the slit would be to use the coordinates of the optical center , e.g. , like dbb have done .",
    "they find that telescope control usually allows a repeatable positioning with an accuracy of better than @xmath15 .",
    "their procedure reduces the observational uncertainty significantly .",
    "another contributor to the alignment error is the accuracy of the optical center itself . for many cataloged galaxies",
    "the optical center has been determined from photographic plates . for the faint and often irregular dwarf and",
    "lsb galaxies , the centers determined in this way may well be incorrect by many arcseconds .",
    "but even if ccd photometry with accurate astrometry is available , there may still be considerable uncertainty in the position of the optical center .",
    "swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) have determined the centers of the 171 dwarf galaxies in their sample , and published the centers of the isophotal fits versus radius .",
    "their figures show that there is considerable spread in the best fitting centers as a function of radius , and that the centers of the inner and outer isophotes usually differ by a few arcseconds , and sometimes even as much as @xmath71 .    a third possible contributor to slit alignment errors",
    "is an offset between the kinematical and optical centers .",
    "such an offset is not uncommon in dwarf and lsb galaxies ( e.g. , puche , carignan , & wainscoat 1991 ; swaters et al .",
    "1999 ) . obviously ,",
    "if the dynamical and the kinematical center do not agree , the steepest gradient in the velocity field of the galaxy may be missed , and the inner slope underestimated .",

    "= 0.95      = 1.00    in edge - on galaxies , the line - of - sight traverses the entire galaxy disk , and hence a range of radii contribute to the observed velocity profiles . however , only the gas on the major axis reflects the circular velocity at that galactocentric radius , whereas gas from all other radii has smaller projected velocities .",
    "the result is a broad velocity profile that is strongly skewed toward lower rotation velocities .",
    "simply taking the barycenter or a gaussian fit will thus result in an underestimate of the rotation velocity . to derive the true rotation velocity ,",
    "the extreme velocity should be used . to determine this reliably a very high velocity resolution",
    "is needed , much higher than is provided by the long - slit observations presented here .",
    "in addition , determining the extreme velocity becomes more difficult if the  emission is weak on the line of nodes .",
    "a more subtle cause of uncertainties in determining the dark matter cusp slope is related to the spatial distribution of  in the part of the galaxy that is visible through the slit .",
    "if the emission is uniform , this is not likely to play a role , but if the  distribution is knotty , substantial underestimates may occur .",
    "for example , consider the case in which there is no  emission on the major axis , but that there is emission just next to it , but still within the area viewed by the slit , or smeared into that area by the seeing .",
    "the projected rotation velocity just next to the major axis is lower than exactly on the major axis , and thus an irregular distribution may lead to an underestimate of the derived rotation curve .",
    "this effect is stronger when the seeing is poor , and it is especially strong in the center , where small spatial differences may lead to large velocity differences ( see also barth et al .",
    "the effects of the distribution of  can be modeled if an image is available , allowing a more accurate measurement of the rotation curve .",
    "non - circular motions are another source of systematic errors in the mass densities derived from rotation curves .",
    "the usual assumption for derived rotation curves is that the gas moves on circular orbits .",
    "however , this assumption is not always accurate .",
    "structural features such as bars , spiral arms , lopsidedness , the irregular distribution of stars and gas , and the effects of star formation may all leave an imprint on the kinematics . the effects of such non - circular motions are usually most important in the central regions , where rotation velocities are relatively low and were the physical causes for non - circular motions , such as bars and star formation activity , are strongest .",
    "it is difficult to model the effect of non - circular motions on the derived rotation curve because many factors may contribute .",
    "for example , a high star formation rate may lead to gas outflows and to an increase the dispersion of the emission line gas , or of the gas clouds , resulting in a lower azimuthal velocity component , and hence an underestimate of the rotation velocity .",
    "the magnitude of this asymmetric drift is uncertain and difficult to calculate , as was pointed out in section  [ secderrcs ] .",
    "the effects of bars on the rotation curves depend on the bars properties such as their orientation and strength .",
    "other structural perturbations such as lopsidedness or spiral structure , may either lead to an underestimate or an overestimate of the rotation velocity , depending on the kind of disturbance and its orientation .",
    "from section  [ secobseffs ] it is clear that there are strong observational biases toward shallower slopes . in this section ,",
    "we derive more quantitative estimates of how these observational effects affect the inner slopes derived from inversion of the rotation curves and the mass modeling , based on model observations .",
    "we focus on the effects of the seeing , slit width , slit alignment errors and edge - on galaxies , because their effects can be most readily determined from model observations .    to construct the model velocity fields , we have assumed the model galaxies to be infinitely thin disks that are uniformly filled with  emission .",
    "we also experimented with alternative , more complicated distributions , but found that these do not significantly change the main results as long as the size of the seeing disk is small compared to the typical length scale of variations in the  emission .",

    "next , we extracted from the model velocity field a spectrum for a given slit width and a given offset from the model galaxy center , and derived a rotation curve using the same procedure as for the real observations . because the effects of seeing and slit width are similar , and because usually observers match the slit width to the typical seeing , we have focused only on models with equal slit width and seeing . finally , we analyzed these model rotation curves in the same way as the real data ( see section  [ secresults ] ) .",

    "[ figalpharin ] it is clear that we do find steep inner slopes among the best resolved galaxies , and that the steep slopes of the galaxies in our sample are not the result of the inclusion of the @xmath84 outer parts .",
    "our model observations presented in section  [ secmodmassmod ] have shown that the parameters derived from the mass modeling are less sensitive to the effects of seeing , slit width and slit offsets , because the entire rotation curve is used to determine the parameters , and not only the innermost part . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass modeling is also less sensitive to the particular value of the inner slope of the dark matter halo ( the cusp - core degeneracy ) , and for most galaxies we find that mass models based on @xmath9 provide fits of similar quality as those based on @xmath3 .",
    "this is not only true if the contribution of the stellar disk is ignored , but also for models in which the stellar disks play a modest role .",
    "nonetheless , in about 25% of the galaxies the mass models with @xmath9 give significantly poorer fits than those based on @xmath3 , even if the baryonic component is ignored ( ugc  4325 , ugc  4499 , f563-v2 and f568 - 3 ) .",
    "even though our modeling in section  [ secmodmassmod ] has shown that the @xmath61 value may be biased by slit offsets , unrealistically large offsets would be required to make the observed rotation curves consistent with a halo with @xmath9 .",
    "hence , it is not likely that the poor fits for these four galaxies are the result of alignment errors , except perhaps in the case of ugc  4325 , in which the optical center and the dynamical center derived by s99 are offset by @xmath97 .",
    "a possibility is that some of these poor fits are the result of non - circular motions .",
    "it is difficult to get an estimate of the strength of non - circular motion from the observations presented here , as our long - slit observations only provide a one - dimensional slice through the velocity field . on the other hand",
    ", the optical morphology may provide an indication of whether non - circular motions play a role . as a first order indicator of the presence of non - circular motions",
    ", we used the presence of a bar .",
    "the galaxies in our sample with either mild or strong bars are ugc  731 , ugc  4499 , ugc  11861 , f563-v2 , and f568 - 3 .",
    "interestingly , 3 out of the 4 galaxies which are poorly fit by an nfw halo have strong bars ( ugc  4499 , f563-v2 and f568 - 3 ) , suggesting that the non - circular motions associated with bars may have contributed to the poor fits .    in conclusion , we find that almost all galaxies in our sample are consistent with pseudo - isothermal halos .",
    "about three quarters of our sample is also consistent with nfw halos , and the remaining quarter may have been affected by non - circular motions .",
    "based on the sample of galaxies presented here , and given the uncertainties , we find that slopes in the range @xmath69 are consistent with the observations .",
    "our conclusion that the inner slopes of the dark halos seem consistent both with @xmath3 and @xmath9 appears to be add odds with the conclusions from dbmbr and dbb , who found that the derived inner slopes for the galaxies in their sample peaks at @xmath109 , with a tail toward steeper slopes .",
    "here we investigate whether the systematic effects studied in this paper may have played a role in their work .",
    "to this end , we have divided the galaxies from the dbmbr and dbb sample in three categories , based on a visual inspection of their optical images : edge - on galaxies , barred galaxies , and the remaining galaxies .",
    "we have separated the galaxies into two distance groups , one with galaxies that are closer than @xmath110 , and one with galaxies that are more distant than that .",
    "as before , the separation in these two distance groups was done to match    -0.3 cm    the separation in these two distance groups was done to match the distances used in the models presented in section  [ secmodeling ] .",
    "we have excluded the three lsb galaxies that dbmbr took from the verheijen ( 1997 ) sample , because these were based on low - resolution  observations .",
    "we present the distributions of measured inner slopes for each of the categories in fig .",
    "[ figalphalit ] .",
    "the galaxies in the sample discussed in this paper are also included . for galaxies that are present in both our and the literature studies ,",
    "we have used the results presented here .",
    "using the modeling results from section  [ secobseffs ] , we calculated the expected distribution of observed inner slopes for the non - edge - on and non - barred galaxies , given an intrinsic inner slope of the dark matter distribution , a slit with of @xmath78 ( the average of the observations in the different samples ) and different values for the slit alignment error , for galaxies within @xmath110 , and for galaxies beyond @xmath110 .",
    "the expected distributions have been calculated in the same way as described in section  [ secdiscinn ] , and are overplotted on the histograms in fig .",
    "[ figalphalit].-10000    -0.3 cm    for the non - barred galaxies with @xmath111 , the measured inner slopes span a wide range from @xmath3 to @xmath9 , and for the closeby galaxies some galaxies even appear to have negative @xmath0 , i.e. , a dark matter density that increases with radius .",
    "the distribution of @xmath56 for the non - barred galaxies in the combined sample appears inconsistent with the distribution expected for halos with @xmath3 , because of the excess of galaxies with steeper inner slopes .",
    "however , it is possible that the stellar disks do contribute significantly and this may explain the wing to high @xmath56 even if the halos have @xmath3 .",
    "the models with @xmath9 appear to underpredict the number of galaxies with @xmath56 near zero , unless the error in the slit positioning is about @xmath18 , for which the model is good agreement with the observed distribution .",
    "an error of @xmath18 in the slit positioning may not be unreasonable given the large angular size of these galaxies and their irregular , diffuse and low surface brightness nature , and the fact that pointing errors , errors in their optical centers , and possible offsets between optical and dynamical center all contribute .",
    "for the galaxies at 60 mpc the expected distributions for the different intrinsic halo shapes are more similar , although again it appears as if the model for @xmath3 appears to underpredict the number of galaxies with steep slopes .    as before ,",
    "we have used the presence of a bar as an indicator of the presence of non - circular motions .",
    "the distribution of @xmath56 for the barred galaxies is shown separately in fig .",
    "[ figalphalit ] .",
    "although based on only a few galaxies , the barred galaxies on average appear to have a somewhat lower @xmath56 . this may be an indication that the non - circular motions associated with the bar have affected the inner slopes .",
    "on the other hand , if these bars were randomly oriented , one would expect that such non - circular motions would mostly lead to an increased scatter in the rotation curves , as observed by e.g. , sofue et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and hence on @xmath56 , but hardly to systematically lower values .",
    "however , in most of the galaxies in both our sample and the literature sample , the bars are not randomly oriented , but preferentially aligned with the major axis in almost all galaxies .",
    "this might explain the observed shallower gradients in these galaxies . alternatively , the barred galaxies in our sample may have halos with intrinsically shallow inner slopes .",
    "a striking feature in fig .  [ figalphalit ] is the large difference in the distribution of measured inner slopes between edge - on galaxies and the non - barred galaxies , in both distance groups .",
    "although perhaps a result of the possibility that galaxies selected to have low surface brightnesses when seen edge - on have different intrinsic properties than those selected to have low surface brightnesses when seen face - on , a more likely explanation is that this marked difference is artificial . as demonstrated in section",
    "[ secmodedgeon ] , the method used here and in several literature studies is not suited to derive rotation curves for edge - on galaxies , as it results in a severe underestimate of the inner slope .",
    "in fact , as shown in section  [ secmodedgeon ] , this method , when applied to edge - on galaxies dominated by nfw halos , yields an inner slope of @xmath112 , close to the peak dbmbr found .",
    "the sample presented in this paper has a number of galaxies in common with the samples presented in dbmr and dbb . in fig .",
    "[ figcompalpha ] we plot the inner slopes as derived in the literature version those derived there .",
    "the filed circles represent the inner slopes derived for the five lsb galaxies presented in smt .",
    "for these five galaxies _ the same _ data have been analyzed in different ways by dbmr and by us .",
    "the open circles represent galaxies for which dbb and we have independent observations . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ figcompalpha ] , the inner slopes derived in this paper generally are steeper than those derived in the literature .",
    "the reasons for this difference are not clear .",
    "probably the choice of the break radius within which the inner slope is measured , the fact that dbmr and dbb have derived their rotation curves by fitting smooth curves to their data , and the fact that the data have been binned in @xmath18 intervals here and in dbmbr , but @xmath113 for some galaxies in dbb all play a role .",
    "irrespective of the cause for the difference , it is clear that when different observers find such different results for the same galaxies , even when the same data are used , the data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn .",
    "in addition , we compared the derived values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the galaxies that we have in common with dbmr and dbb .",
    "in contrast with the results for the derived inner slopes , the derived halo parameters show little or no systematic difference between our and their best fit values , although there is a considerable scatter of about 35% between the best fit values for @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that there is a systematic difference between the derived inner slopes but hardly in the derived halo parameters is not unexpected .",
    "the inner slope is determined solely from the inner few points .",
    "on the other hand , the mass modeling uses the entire rotation curve , and the outer parts of the rotation curves both in our and in the literature samples are similar in shape because they both use the  data from s99 .",
    "we have also compared our fitting results to those obtained by marchesini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who have three galaxies in common with the our sample ( ugc  4325 , ugc  4499 , and ugc  11861 ) .",
    "the fits presented in their fig .  5 strongly overpredict the inner rise of the rotation curves for their nfw models",
    "however , as marchesini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) warn , they did not fit the observed rotation curves , but only normalized each curve to its last point . when instead they make fits using the same mass models as described in section  [ secmassmodels ] , they find best fit values for @xmath59 and @xmath114 in good agreement with our results .",
    "cm      the properties of dark matter halos depend on the nature of dark matter and the cosmological parameters .",
    "here we compare the predictions made from simulations based on the currently popular @xmath115cdm paradigm .",
    "there is disagreement between the different cosmological simulations as to what the expected inner slope of the dark matter halos in a universe dominated by cdm is . as noted in the introduction",
    ", several studies have reported an inner slope with @xmath10 , but the most recent simulations seem to prefer @xmath116 .",
    "this difference is crucial , as none of the galaxies in our sample or the literature sample are consistent with @xmath10 , whereas most of them , given the involved uncertainties , seem consistent with @xmath9 . at the same time ,",
    "none of these galaxies _ require _ halos with @xmath9 , as their rotation curves are usually equally well or better explained by halos with shallower density profiles or even constant density cores .    in fig .",
    "[ fignfwvsml ] we compare the best - fit values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 obtained from fitting mass models to the observed rotation curves with the predictions from the numerical simulations of navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and bullock et al .",
    "the open and filled circles represent the halo parameters found for the barred and the non - barred galaxies in our sample , the open and filled triangles are the barred and the non - barred galaxies in dbmr and dbb , and the crosses are the edge - on galaxies in their sample .",
    "we have plotted the results for a range in m / l for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "note that the fitting results are slightly different from the results listed in table  [ tabfitpars ] , because in the fitting here the contribution of the  has been taken into account .",
    "[ fignfwvsml ] shows that the majority of the galaxies have values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 that are consistent with @xmath115cdm , provided the m / l of the stellar disk is about 2 or smaller .",
    "m / ls in this range are consistent with predictions from stellar population synthesis models . based on the typical @xmath117 color of @xmath118 for the galaxies in this sample ( de blok et al .",
    "1995 , swaters & balcells 2002 ) , m / ls in the range 0.4 to 1.4 are expected ( e.g. , bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these synthesis models do not provide a normalization of the m / l , and changes in the adopted properties of the stellar initial mass function will change the expected m / ls .",
    "if the m / ls are larger than 2 , more and more galaxies become inconsistent with the predictions of @xmath115cdm .",
    "one galaxy from our sample , ugc  11557 , as is also apparent from table  [ tabfitpars ] , has a low @xmath59 as derived from the best fit .",
    "however , as is clear from fig .",

    "barred galaxies seem to have somewhat lower values for @xmath59 , and , as shown in figs .",

    "the results from weiner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for ngc  4123 and binney & evans ( 2001 ) for the galaxy indicate that the disks in these galaxies are close to maximal , resulting in low density halos with shallow cores .",
    "such shallow cores appear to be in conflict with the predictions by @xmath115cdm simulations , although one might envision a scenario in which the interaction between a bar and a cuspy dark halo results in the formation of a constant density core ( weinberg & katz 2002 ) .",
    "we presented high resolution  rotation curves for a sample of 15 dwarf and lsb galaxies derived from long - slit observations . from these , we measured the slope of the central mass distribution , both from the mass density distribution implied by the rotation curves , and from fitting mass models to the rotation curves .    to assess the influence of systematic effects on the derived inner slopes , we have modeled the effects of galaxy inclination , slit width , seeing and slit alignment errors on the derived rotation curves .",
    "other systematic effects that are less easily modeled , such as non - circular motions or the detailed spatial distribution of emission , have been discussed but not modeled .",
    "combined , these systematic effects may lead to a systematic bias toward shallower slopes if the intrinsic halo profile has a steep inner slope .",
    "if the inner slope is intrinsically shallow , the inner slope is hardly affected , and may even be somewhat overestimated .    using the data presented in the paper , and recent data for similar galaxies presented in the literature , we find that both the inner slopes as derived from the mass density profiles and from the mass model fitting indicate that most galaxies in our sample are consistent with the range in intrinsic inner slopes @xmath69 .",
    "inner slopes with @xmath70 are ruled out by these observations .",
    "the range of intrinsic inner slopes that appear consistent with the observations is rather large , because the inner slopes as derived from the mass density profiles are susceptible to the systematic effects mentioned in this paper , and because the mass modeling is not very sensitive to the inner slopes ( the cusp - core degeneracy ) .",
    "we note that about 25% of the galaxies in our sample appear to be inconsistent with nfw halos .",
    "these galaxies are predominantly barred , suggesting either the rotation curves for these galaxies may have been affected by the non - circular motions associated with the bars , or perhaps that the halos of these galaxies intrinsically have shallower slopes .",
    "the remaining 75% have best - fit values for their halo parameters that are consistent with the values expected in a @xmath115cdm cosmology , provided that the @xmath6-band stellar mass - to - light ratios are smaller than about 2 .",

    "many of the systematic effects discussed in this paper can be avoided if high - resolution , two - dimensional velocity fields are used .",
