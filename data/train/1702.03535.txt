    "generalized or q - statistical mechanics  la tsallis has generated manifold applications in the last quarter of a century @xcite .",
    "it has been shown ( see for instance , @xcite ) that tsallis q - statistics is of great importance for dealing with some astrophysical issues involving self - gravitating systems @xcite . moreover",
    ", this statistics has proved its utility in many different scientific fields , with several thousands of publications and authors @xcite , so that studying its structural features is an important issue for physics , astronomy , biology , neurology , economics , etc . @xcite .",
    "the success of the q - statistics reaffirms the well grounded notion asserting that there is much physics whose origin is of purely statistical nature ( not mechanical ) . as a spectacular example , me mention the application of q - ideas to high energy experimental physics , where the q - statistics appears to adequately describe the transverse momentum distributions of different hadrons @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that as yet unexplored gravitational effects characterize this q - theory on account of _ divergences _ that , in some circumstances , emerge , within the q - statistical framework , in both the mean energy @xmath1 and the partition function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "divergences constitute an important issue in theoretical physics . indeed , the study and elimination of divergences of a physical theory is perhaps one of the most important aspects of theoretical work .",
    "the quintessential typical example is the thus far failed , attempt to quantify the gravitational field .",
    "some examples of elimination of divergences can be looked at in references @xcite .",
    "we will use here an extremely simplified version , such as that of @xcite , of the ideas of @xcite in connection with tsallis q - statistics @xcite , with emphasis in its applicability to gravitational issues @xcite , in particular self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "we will see that the removal of the above mentioned divergences produces interesting insights .",
    "it is to be stressed that for @xmath9 the system can not exist , as no probabilities can be introduced .",
    "then , several options are available .",
    "@xmath10 is the natural state of affairs .",
    "we will uncover that , in a tsallis scenario , @xmath11 is possible for special q - values which entails boundedness .",
    "also negative specific heats @xmath12 may emerge , an indication of gravitational effects @xcite .",
    "these interesting results appear after using mathematics known since at least 40 years ago and for whose development m. veltman and g. thooft where awarded the nobel prize of physics in 1999 .",
    "acquaintance with such mathematics is not really needed to understand this paper .",
    "the reader has merely to accept that their physical significance can not be doubted . in a few words",
    ", one needs from the above mathematics analytical extensions and dimensional regularization @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in three regions of the argument of the @xmath3-function contained in them .",
    "the nature of the argument of the @xmath3-function governs the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . this behavior yields three different regions , for a given spatial dimension @xmath4 , tsallis index @xmath2 and number of particles @xmath13 .",
    "the region s particularities are : + @xmath14 + @xmath15 + @xmath16 + normal monoatomic gas behavior is encountered in region ( 1 ) . instead , gravitational effects are discovered in region ( 2 ) .",
    "finally , in region ( 3 ) we have both normal behavior and gravitational effects .",
    "in particular the @xmath13 particles are grouped into quartets that remind one of alpha particles . *",
    "it should be noted than in case ( 3 ) we are making a regularization of the corresponding theory and not a renormalization . *",
    "we stress that here we use normal ( linear in the probability ) expectation values , and not the weighted ones usually attached to tsallis theory @xcite . remark that in this case , restricting ourselves to the interval @xmath17 $ ] , the so - called tsallis cut - off @xcite does not apply .",
    "the q - partition function of a monoatomic gas is given by : @xmath18^{\\frac { 1}{q-1}}d^{\\nu}p_1d^{\\nu}p_2\\cdot\\cdot \\cdot d^{\\nu}p_n,\\ ] ] the mean energy is defined by : @xmath19^{\\frac { 1}{q-1}}\\ ] ] @xmath20    both integrals are in general divergent for many values of @xmath2 .",
    "this can be proved by a simple powers count .",
    "we appeal to techniques developed in @xcite so as to deal with them .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have computed both @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtaining : @xmath21^ { \\frac { \\nu",
    "n } { 2 } } \\frac { \\gamma\\left(\\frac { 1 } { 1-q}-\\frac { \\nu n } { 2}\\right ) } { \\gamma\\left(\\frac { 1 } { 1-q}\\right)}.\\ ] ] @xmath22^{\\frac { \\nu n } { 2 } } \\frac { \\gamma\\left(\\frac { 1 } { 1-q}-\\frac { \\nu n } { 2 } -1\\right ) } { \\gamma\\left(\\frac { 1 } { 1-q}\\right)}.\\ ] ] @xmath23}.\\ ] ] the derivative with respect to @xmath24 yields for the specific heat at constant volume    @xmath25",
    "we briefly review now results obtained in ref . @xcite",
    ". some related work by livadiotis , mccomas , and obregon , should be cited @xcite .",
    "we pass first to analyze the gamma functions involved in computing @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for the region @xmath26 $ ] . from ( [ eq2.1 ] )",
    "we have , for positive gamma - argument @xmath27 in the same vein we have from ( [ eq2.2 ] ) @xmath28 we reach then two conditions that pose severe limitations on the particle - number @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 there is a maximum permissible @xmath29 . for example , if @xmath31 , one has @xmath32 we can not have more than 665 particles . keeping the dimensionality equal to three , for @xmath33",
    "just one particle is permitted and for @xmath34 , no particles can be present exist .",
    "roughly , for a number of particles of the order of @xmath35 , @xmath2 has to be of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "the exposition of our present results starts here . we pass first to considering negative gamma arguments in ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , which will require analytical extension / dimensional regularization in integrals ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 )",
