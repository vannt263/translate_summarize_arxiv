    "the fact that the average shape of fluctuations is a semicircle for both gaussian walks and lvy flights is a nicely surprising result that led us to wonder to what extent it might hold for other walks with uncorrelated jumps . in particular , we investigated the average shape of subdiffusive stochastic processes ( subdiffusive walks ) of the form @xmath16 where @xmath1 are uncorrelated increments that follow a distribution with finite variance and @xmath0 is a random variable whose distribution @xmath17 has a broad power - law tail : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
