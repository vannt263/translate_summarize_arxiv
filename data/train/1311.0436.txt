    "recently , topological insulators and superconductors have drawn a great attention in the field of condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "they are gapped phases of fermions with topologically protected boundary modes .",
    "these boundary states , however , are gapless and protected against arbitrary perturbations .",
    "they can be described by the topological band theories if excluding the interactions .",
    "the classification of gapped free fermion system has been systematically developed by means of k - theory@xcite , minimal dirac representation@xcite , or nonlinear @xmath0 model@xcite approaches , respectively .",
    "but for the interacting systems , it is generally difficult to directly study the topological classification of gapped interacting hamiltonians .",
    "qi @xmath1 @xcite obtained the classification based on the topological response field theories , i.e. , chern - simons field theory under the constraint of discrete symmetries , in which the topological order parameters were included as a coefficient and can be expressed with green functions@xcite .",
    "however , the classification is usually very difficult for practical evaluation since the topological order parameters are associated with the integral of green function within the entire frequency domain . recently , wang @xmath1@xcite greatly simplified the integral topological invariants by showing that the essential topological information can be extracted just from the zero - frequency green function or topological hamiltonians@xcite , which is in analogy with the free fermion systems .",
    "therefore , the topological classification of the interacting systems can be directly studied with the topological hamiltonians as developed by wang .",
    "thus it is a prerequisite to fully understand the topological structure of the periodic table for the non - interacting topological insulators and superconductors , in order to furthermore study the classification of corresponding interacting ones such as topological mott and anderson insulators@xcite .",
    "the periodic table of non - trivial free - fermion topological states is presented in table [ table1 ] , in which the ten symmetric classes has been grouped into two classes called the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases , respectively@xcite .",
    "the classification of the hamiltonian is based on the symmetry principle , and is first developed with random matrix theory by altland and zirnbauer@xcite in physics community .",
    "it is known from table [ table1 ] that there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological states in every spatial dimension . and",
    "it is easily to obtain clear 2-fold and 8-fold pattern with the variation of spatial dimension @xmath4 ( the same row of table.[table1 ] ) for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases , respectively .",
    "moreover , by looking into the shift along the symmetric axis @xmath5 ( the same column of table [ table1 ] ) , one could also get similar 2-fold and 8-fold period pattern for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases , respectively .",
    "the beautiful periodic pattern illustrated above can be understood based on the abstract real k - theory@xcite with bott periodic theorem@xcite .",
    "however , a relatively simple interpretation will be beneficial for physicists to easily catch up the fundamental basis for the topological classification .",
    "for this purpose , m. stone , @xmath1 @xcite has given a relatively simple homotopy interpretation about the topological relationship between the elements along axis @xmath5 for @xmath6 case and the periodic pattern was therefore obtained .",
    "but there is no a simple homotopic explanation for the spatial dimension @xmath4 dependence yet so far in the same row of the table .",
    ".**periodic table for the classification of topological insulators and superconductors .",
    "the second and third rows are associated with two distinct super - families in the altland - zirnbauer classification , a set of two is associated with the unitary group and a set of eight is associated with the real orthogonal group .",
    "the first column is the cartan label of classifying spaces , with chiral classes denoted by bold letters .",
    "the symmetry classes can be represented by an integer @xmath5 defined modulo 2 and 8 for the complex and real cases , respectively .",
    "the symbols @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicate that the topologically distinct phases within a given symmetry class of topological insulators ( superconductors ) are characterized by an integer invariant ( @xmath7 ) or ( @xmath8 ) quantity , respectively . * * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in zero dimension , the hamiltonian is not dependent on the momentum @xmath10 .",
    "so it is required to search for all possible symmetric spaces without considering the complexity affected by the involution of @xmath11 for @xmath12 case .",
    "the classifying spaces in zero dimension @xmath13 have been studied by bott@xcite and milnor@xcite in mathematics community .",
    "recently , m. stone @xmath1 , from a more physical point of view , got the real classifying spaces by introducing more anti - commuting orthogonal complex structures ( [ complex structure ] ) for the group @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is so large that the homotopy group @xmath16 is in the stable range@xcite . physically",
    ", the classifying spaces can be understood as the manifold of the goldstone mode after symmetry breaking . in order to reveal the loop sequences between them ,",
    "@xmath17 is defined as the space of complex structure @xmath18 set , which is anti - commuting with the fixed @xmath19 when denoting @xmath20 .",
    "here , @xmath21 is the anti - commuting orthogonal complex structures which satisfy @xmath22 from the definition of @xmath17 , we have the following sequence of spaces @xmath23 after eight steps , the sequence of spaces repeats itself as @xmath24 , called bott periodicity of orthogonal group .",
    "the explicit homogenous manifold has been listed in table[table2 ] .",
    "it is known from the work by @xmath25lie cartan , there are only ten possible symmetric compact groups that can be served as the hamiltonians of gapped free - fermion systems with @xmath26 @xcite for @xmath3 case .",
    "next , we will show the loop sequence of classifying spaces @xmath27 by using minima geodesic construction method developed by milnor@xcite .",
    "for the manifold of @xmath28 , one can derive that the @xmath14 subspace satisfying @xmath29 is homogenous manifold @xmath30 . in order to verify @xmath31",
    ", we construct a curve @xmath32 . because of @xmath33 , one can get @xmath34 . therefore , @xmath35 is a curve in the manifold @xmath36 from the point @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "meanwhile , this curve is actually a minimal geodesic with its midpoint @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the geodesic space can be represented by the space of @xmath40 satisfying @xmath29 .",
    "since the space @xmath41 is symmetric , there indeed exists a loop curve @xmath42 parameterized by @xmath40 .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath43 , or @xmath44 .    for the space @xmath45 satisfying @xmath46 and anticommuting with the fixed @xmath40 , one can also get @xmath47 . here",
    "we construct a curve @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "one will get @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is thus deduced that @xmath53 is the minimal geodesic of @xmath28 with the midpoint @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , the loop space of @xmath28 is nothing but @xmath45 , or @xmath55 .",
    "in general , one can prove the space @xmath56 by similar construction method described above .",
    "for example , we can define the curve as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "it is easily to deduce that @xmath59 , and it anticommutes with @xmath60 , but commutes with @xmath61 .",
    "so we have @xmath62 , with @xmath35 a submanifold of @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath35 is a geodesic curve in @xmath63 that interpolates between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "the set of geodesics can be parameterized by @xmath67 . and",
    "finally , we have @xmath56 , or @xmath68 . by applying the bott 8-periodic theorem on group @xmath14",
    ", we obtain the following result : @xmath69    though the construction method established above is tedious , its basic idea is relatively easy to follow : the loop space of @xmath63 is approximated to the minimal geodesics ( each loop can be homotopically deformed into the geodesic ) , and then these geodesics capture the topology of the @xmath67 space .",
    "for example , the set of geodesics from the north to the south pole of the sphere is parameterized by the points on the equator of the sphere .",
    "the loop sequence of any elements in table[table1 ] can be calculated by combining the equations ( [ loop of r ] ) and ( [ rs ] ) .",
    "for example , we get @xmath71 according to @xmath72 which means that the symmetric classifying spaces in any spatial dimension @xmath4 hold the same loop sequence structure as in the @xmath6 case discussed above . and",
    "another very important result called ( 1,1 ) periodicity can also be derived as follows : @xmath73 this is the key result of this work since it reveals the fundamental relationship within the ( 1,1 ) periodicity theorem of the real k - theory or kr - theory@xcite . after having the topological loop relationship for any classifying spaces , the gapped topological states of matters",
    "can therefore be classified by using homotopy group as @xmath74 , @xmath5 mod 8 .",
    "it is obvious that increasing spatial dimension has the opposite effect on adding symmetry .",
    "so the distinct topological insulators in dimension @xmath4 is classified by @xmath74 , rather than @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , it takes us back to the bott clock@xcite .",
    "in summary , the topological relationship between any classifying spaces for gapped free - fermion systems has been established with the loop sequence . and",
    "meanwhile , a simple homotopy explanation of the @xmath76 sign change affected by the inversion of @xmath11 of bloch momentum has been given , which is usually very difficult to understand without using abstract k - theory . even though the explicit hamiltonian of the non - trivial topological states of matter is very complicated , our results show that the whole periodic table of topological classification has a relatively simple homotopy interpretation based on the loop sequence as developed in this paper . + * acknowledgments *    the author acknowledges the manuscript s reading and suggestions from xinhui zhang and zhong wang .",
