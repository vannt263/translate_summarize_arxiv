    "acoustic is an active field of research which is concerned with the generation and space - time evolution of small mechanical perturbations in fluid ( sound waves ) or in solid ( elastic waves ) .",
    "one of the important equations in nonlinear acoustics is the kuznetsov equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the acoustic velocity potential , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the diffusivity and speed of sound , and the nonlinearity parameter , respectively .",
    "the derivation of equation can be obtained from the general equations of fluid mechanics but we include a brief summary of its derivation , that can be found with more details in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite and the references therein , for instance .",
    "it is based on the relations coming from the conservation of mass , conservation of momentum and entropy balance in the model of thermo - viscous flow in a compressible fluid :    * the equation of conservation of mass ( continuity equation ) : @xmath11 * the equation of conservation of momentum ( newton s second law ) : @xmath12 * the equation of conservation of energy ( first law of thermodynamics ) : @xmath13    in the previous equations we are considering @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the velocity , pressure and specific entropy of the acoustic particle , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 as mass density and the heat flux vector , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath19 is the deformation or strain tensor given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the cauchy  poisson stress tensor given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the identity matrix , @xmath24 is the shear viscosity ( the first coefficient of viscosity ) and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the second coefficient of viscosity ( the bulk viscosity ) .",
    "the components of @xmath27 are @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the components of @xmath21 and @xmath19 , respectively",
    ".    it can be seen ( see the above references for the details ) that equations and can be rewritten as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the previous equations , together with and the following equations of state @xmath32 are the navier stokes equations .    first , we assume that the deviation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 from their equilibrium values @xmath35 and @xmath36 is small . by taking the taylor series expansion of around values at rest @xmath37 and @xmath38 and ignoring the higher order terms , we get @xmath39 we put @xmath40 where @xmath41",
    ", @xmath42 is the coefficient of volume expansion and @xmath43 is the ratio of specific heat , as @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the specific heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume .",
    "then , the pressure @xmath15 is given by @xmath46,\\ ] ]    by assuming that the flow is rotation free , that is @xmath47 , and introducing the acoustic velocity potential @xmath48 , then it has been shown in @xcite and @xcite , that equation , can be derived from the above set of equations by assuming the fourier law of heat conduction @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath34 is the absolute temperature .",
    "it is known that by modeling heat conduction with the fourier law ( [ fourier_law ] ) , which assumes the flux @xmath18 to be proportional to the gradient of the temperature @xmath51 at the same time @xmath52 , leads to the paradox of infinite heat propagation speed ( that is , any thermal disturbance at a single point has an instantaneous effect everywhere in the medium ) and also fails when @xmath18 increases or @xmath53 decreases ( see @xcite ) . to overcome this drawback , a number of modifications of the basic assumption on the relation between the heat flux and the temperature have been made , such as the maxwell  cattaneo law , the gurtin ",
    "pipkin theory , the jeffreys law , the green  naghdi theory and others .",
    "the common feature of these theories is that all permit transmission of heat flow as thermal waves at finite speed .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "one of these laws is the maxwell  cattaneo law , that assumes the following relation between heat flux and temperature : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the relaxation time of the heat flux ( usually small ) . by considering , instead of and combining it with the equations of fluid mechanics , we get , instead of , the jordan  moore  gibson  thompson equation ( see @xcite )    @xmath56    where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the diffusivity of sound .    in this paper",
    "we consider the linearized version of equation , known as the moore ",
    "thompson equation in the acoustics theory : @xmath59 this linear equation is an active field of research . it also arises in viscous thermally relaxing fluids and has applications in medical and industrial use of high intensity ultrasound such as lithotripsy , thermotherapy or ultrasound cleaning ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but it also appears in viscoelasticity theory under the name of _ standard linear model _ of vicoelasticity ( sometimes also called kelvin or zener model ) to explain the behaviour of certain viscoelastic materials ( that is , that exhibit both a viscous fluid and an elastic solid response ) such as , for instance , fluids with complex microestructure ( see @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", @xmath7 represents the linear deformations of a viscoelastic solid with an approach that is considered to be more realistic than the usual kelvin - voigt model .",
    "actually , this model seems to be the simplest one that reflects both creeping and stress relaxation effects in viscoelastic materials ( see @xcite or @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the derivation of equation in @xmath60 in the context of viscoelasticity theory can be obtained in the following way .",
    "let us recall that in viscoelasticity theory , springs and dashpots represent the elastic and viscous components of the materials , respectively . according to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , among others , in the one dimensional case this equation represents a linear spring connected in series with a kelvin - voigt system , that is , another linear spring connected in parallel with a dashpot .",
    "this is a common way of approaching viscoelastic systems using a rheological point of view . using this formulation ( see again @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for more details ) ,",
    "it is easy to see that such a system is governed by the following relation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the stress and @xmath63 is the strain . according to @xcite , @xmath55 is the stress relaxation time under constant strain , @xmath64 is the strain relaxation time under constant stress and @xmath65 is the relaxed elastic modulus . in any case , all of them are parameters involving the elastic and viscous constants of the material . more concretely ,",
    "if @xmath16 stands for the dashpot viscosity coefficient , and @xmath66 represent the young modulus of the first and second elastic springs respectively , one has that @xmath67 however , there are a few references in which the standard linear model is described as a linear spring connected in parallel with a maxwell model , that is , a spring and a dashpot connected in series ( see for instance @xcite , where this model is also called the 3-parameter model ) . in this case , the relation between the stress and strain of the system is also , but the parameters are @xmath68 in both descriptions of the standard viscoelastic model , as relation is the same , the corresponding equation would be @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the longitudinal density of the material .",
    "this equation is obtained thinking our material as a sequence of increasingly series - coupled systems of type , that is , a continuous model with as single component ( see chapter 6 of @xcite or section 2 of @xcite for a similar deduction on different models ) .    in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite it",
    "is assumed that @xmath71 ( dissipative system ) , with @xmath72 being small constants .",
    "observe that in both descriptions of the parameters and this is a natural assumption : in it is fulfilled unless @xmath73 ( no dashpot ) , @xmath74 ( only the kelvin - voigt sytem ) or @xmath75 ( infinitely rigid second spring ) , while in it is fulfilled unless @xmath73 ( no dashpot ) or @xmath76 ( infinitely rigid first spring ) . in all these particular cases , we would obtain the conservative case @xmath77 .",
    "the case @xmath78 is treated in @xcite , where the authors show the chaotic behaviour of the corresponding solution .",
    "the initial boundary value problem associated to has been studied recently by many authors in bounded domains . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the authors considered the linearized equation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a positive self - adjoint operator , and showed that by neglecting diffusivity of the sound coefficient ( @xmath81 ) there arises a lack of existence of a semigroup associated with the linear dynamics . on the other hand , they showed that when the diffusivity of the sound is strictly positive ( @xmath82 ) , the linear dynamics are described by a strongly continuous semigroup , which is exponentially stable provided that @xmath83 , while if @xmath84 the energy is conserved ( the same type of results are obtained in @xcite or @xcite using energy methods , or in @xcite using the analysis of the spectrum of the operator ) .",
    "the exponential decay rate results in @xcite are completed in @xcite , where the obtention of an explicit scalar product where the operator is normal allows the authors to obtain the optimal exponential decay rate of the solutions .",
    "finally , in @xcite , the authors show the caotic behaviour of the system when @xmath85 , as we have mentioned above .",
    "observe that in this third order in time equation , the strong damping term @xmath86 is responsible for the well - posedness of the problem , while in the wave equation with strong damping ( @xmath87 ) the strong damping term is responsible for the analiticity of the semigroup .",
    "we also mention the recent paper @xcite where the authors consider with a memory damping term and show an exponential decay of the energy provided that the kernel is exponentially decaying .",
    "this result is generalized in @xcite , where it is shown that the memory kernel decay determines the solution decay .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these equations have not been studied yet in an unbounded domain .",
    "so , the goal of this paper is to show the well - posedness and investigate the decay rate of the solutions of the moore ",
    "thompson equation in an unbounded domain .",
    "namely , we consider the equation @xmath88 with the following initial data @xmath89    in order to state and prove our results , let us first and without loss of generality , take @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath91 , which corresponds to the dissipative case .",
    "we first observe the well - posedness of with initial data in @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "this can be seen using the result of @xcite ( also @xcite ) after applying the following change of variables to the equation : @xmath94 with @xmath85 .",
    "after this change of variables we obtain the equation @xmath95 with @xmath96 observe that @xmath97 for @xmath98 if @xmath99 is small enough . after rearranging terms , equation can be written as @xmath100 observe that , if @xmath99 is small enough , @xmath101 is a positive and self - adjoint operator in @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "observe also that @xmath104 can be seen as a bounded perturbation term .",
    "so , the hypotheses of @xcite are satisfied and , hence , is a well - posed problem in @xmath102 ( and , by linearity , in @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) .",
    "the two main results we obtain for the decay rate of this equation can be seen in theorems [ theorem_main ] and [ theorem_solution_energy_space ] ( and [ theorem_n_3 ] ) below .",
    "first , in section [ sec : energy ] and using the energy method in the fourier space , we show that , if @xmath105 , the energy norm of @xmath106 and of its higher - order derivatives @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , decay as @xmath109 for a certain @xmath110 ( see theorem [ theorem_main ] ) .",
    "the decay rate in is a direct consequence of the estimate of the fourier image @xmath111 : @xmath112 ) .",
    "this method is a very powerful tool in proving the decay rate of the energy norm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but , unfortunately , it is obvious that the estimate does not give us any information about the decay of the solution @xmath113 itself .",
    "it only gives us the decay rate of the energy norm which eventually follows the decay rate of the slowest component of the vector @xmath106 .",
    "so , to overcome this limitation of the lyapunov functional method , we use the eigenvalues expansion method , which is based essentially on the behavior of the eigenvalues of the equation in the fourier space . in section",
    "[ sec : eigenvalues ] we give a complete description of the solutions of the characteristic equation of the corresponding operator and use it to divide the frequency domain into three main parts ( low frequency , middle frequency and high frequency regions ) and estimate the fourier image of the solution in each region . in section [ sec : decay ] and using this method , we are able to prove our second main result , which is the following decay rate of the solution of - when @xmath71 with initial data in @xmath114 , @xmath93 ( see theorem [ theorem_solution_energy_space ] ) : @xmath115 ( for certain @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) and even better estimates if @xmath118 ( see theorem [ theorem_n_3 ] ) : @xmath119 for initial data in the weighted space @xmath120 , @xmath93 , the above estimates will be improved ( see theorem [ theorem_l_1_1_data ] for more details ) .    to summarize , the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : energy ]",
    "we use the energy method in the fourier space to build an appropriate lyapunov functional , that is used to derive the decay rate of the energy norm explained above .",
    "section [ sec : eigenvalues ] is devoted to the eigenvalues expansion method , that is used in section [ sec : decay ] to derive the decay rate of the solution and its spacial derivatives .",
    "in this section , we apply the energy method in the fourier space to show the decay rate of the energy - norm of @xmath108 , where @xmath113 is the solution of - .    first , we can write the problem in the fourier space taking the fourier transform of equation and the initial data .",
