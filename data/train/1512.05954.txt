    "axons are cables that transmit electrical signals between neurons . when the cell body of a neuron , the soma , is fully formed , the neuron begins to sprout small projections known as neurites . after an initial stage and through a process",
    "not fully detailed yet , one of these neurites exhibits a dramatic increase in growth and is denoted the axon .",
    "the axon elongates and seeks its target in the body .",
    "this stage is mainly guided by the mobile and sensitive tip of the axon called the growth cone , which is highly responsive to chemical substances in the body environment .",
    "such chemical cues can attract or repel the growth cone .",
    "this is achieved by a reorganization of the internal protein structure , the cytoskeleton , inside the growth cone . if a gradient of guidance cue is found , cytoskeletal changes happen asymmetrically and the growth cone turns towards or away from the guidance cue .",
    "a description and review of the cytoskeletal dynamics and transport in growth cone motility and axon guidance is provided by dent and gertler  @xcite . a later review by suter and miller  @xcite focuses on the influence of the forces generated by the growth cone on the axonal elongation",
    ". excellent reviews of the different types of modelling of different stages in the development of axons and their behaviour are provided by graham and van ooyen  @xcite , kiddie et al .",
    "@xcite and van ooyen  @xcite .",
    "additional biological insight are provided by miller and heidemann  @xcite . in a recent publication ,",
    "hjort et al .",
    "@xcite model the competitive tubulin - driven outgrowth and withdrawal of different branches of the same neuron .",
    "the elongation of the axon is caused by an assembly ( polymerization ) of free tubulin dimers to microtubules that build up the cytoskeleton .",
    "this occurs mainly in the growth cone , while tubulin is produced in the soma .",
    "the fact that axons can grow very long has initiated both experimental and theoretical investigations of the biological and physical processes which are responsible for the transportation of tubulin along the long axon .",
    "fundamental variables that affect the growth are the amount of available free tubulin in the growth cone , the reaction rates of the polymerization and depolymerization processes in the growth cone , the degradation of tubulin in the entire axon , the tubulin production rate in the soma and the processes of transportation of tubulin along the axon .    we have been attracted by the question of whether it is possible to develop a simple mechanistic model for axonal growth so that some investigations can be performed on how the key biological parameters influence the axonal growth .",
    "hence , we will confine to a one - dimensional model and neither consider any axonal pathfinding nor the branching of axons which sometimes occur .",
    "axons may not only grow but also contract or stay still during time periods , and also alternate between these three phases .",
    "this has lead to include stochastic variables in models .",
    "for example , janulevicius et al .",
    "@xcite model the growth and shrinkage phases of microtubules and the random switches between these phases .",
    "model parameters are collected from the experimental work by walker et al .",
    "deterministic models , which do not contain such random processes , try to catch the mean value of the behaviours of many microtubules .",
    "all mathematical models of biological phenomena are formulated with substantial simplifications .",
    "some phenomenological models utilize mathematical functions to describe certain connections ; for example , otoole and miller  @xcite quantify axonal elongation in terms of slow axonal transport , protein degradation , protein density , adhesion strength and axonal viscosity .",
    "models of the dynamic behaviour are formulated by differential equations .",
    "some dynamic models confine to ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , hence containing unknown functions ( the model outputs ) that depend only on time ; see e.g.  @xcite . because of the substantial length of an axon it is , however , natural to assume that the concentration of a substance varies both with time and position along the axon .",
    "deriving a dynamic model from a physical law , such as the conservation of mass , leads then necessarily to a partial differential equation ( pde ) ; see @xcite . the multi - compartment model by hjort et al .",
    "@xcite , which has a system of odes for each axon , is essentially a spatially discretization of a pde .",
    "however , it is generally safer to write a model including functions of several variables ( spatial location and time ) in terms of pde and then use established numerical methods for their simulation .",
    "garcia et al .",
    "@xcite model the diffusion of tubulin along the axon with the linear diffusion pde and the active transport by tracking the position of each motor protein assuming they all move with a constant velocity .",
    "the microtubule assembly at the tip is modelled by an ode with a constant polymerization rate and they ignore the depolymerization and degradation of tubulin .",
    "furthermore , they propose a mechanical model of the polymerized microtubules in order to describe how the axonal growth process influences the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton .",
    "smith and simmon  @xcite presented and analyzed an interesting model of the two components of axonal cargo transport , diffusion and active , of a substance by means of three linear pdes , all originating from the conservation of mass of one substance present in three states .",
    "one diffusion equation models the free substance , and the other two advection equations model the anterograde and retrograde moving cargoes ( by motor proteins ) , respectively .",
    "the coupling between the equations occur via source terms , or rather binding / detachment terms , which model the movements of substance between the free state and either of the actively moving - cargo states , in both directions .",
    "there are seven model parameters ; one diffusion constant , two advection velocities and four rate constants for the bindings / detachments .",
    "the axon is assumed to have a fixed length and there is no degradation of the substance included in the model .",
    "the model by smith and simmon  @xcite has been used by sadegh zadeh and shah  @xcite , who successfully calibrated the parameters of the model to published experimental data .    as noted by smith and simmon  @xcite , a simplified model of their three linear pdes",
    "consists of a single advection - diffusion pde with only two model parameters ; an effective drift velocity and an effective drift diffusion constant ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formulas ( 4a)(4b ) ) .",
    "we are interested in such a simplified approach for the transport of tubulin along the axon .",
    "such an advection - diffusion pde , with an additional sink term modelling the degradation of tubulin , can be found in the model by mclean and graham  @xcite .    the present work is particulary motivated by the deterministic one - dimensional continuum model by mclean and graham  @xcite .",
    "the linear pde describes the concentration of tubulin as a function of time and distance from the soma along the axon to the growth cone .",
    "the moving growth cone means that the right boundary of the pde is moving with an unknown velocity , which is the axon growth velocity .",
    "such a moving - boundary problem causes some mathematical difficulties .",
    "the axonal elongation speed is modelled by an ode , which should capture the assembly and disassembly of microtubules depending on the available free tubulin concentration at the moving boundary .",
    "the different steady - state solutions are presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "numerical simulations of the model are presented . in @xcite ,",
    "graham et al .  also introduced an additional parameter , the autoregulation gain , related to the production of tubulin in the soma . in @xcite ,",
    "the interesting question of stability of the steady states was investigated .",
    "our model can be seen as an extension and modification of the one by mclean and graham  @xcite . in addition to the linear pde and ode described above",
    ", we have an ode modelling the dynamics of the free tubulin concentration in the growth cone where the motor proteins release the tubulin dimers .",
    "another difference is the modelling of the flux of tubulin over the moving boundary .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is derived in detail in section  [ sect : model ] with the aim of motivating all parameters .",
    "the nominal parameter values chosen are motivated in section  [ sect : parameters ] .",
    "all steady - state solutions of the model are given and characterized in section  [ sect : ss ] .",
    "section  [ sect : plotssspar ] contain plots of how the different steady - state solutions depend on the variation of each parameter from the nominal set of parameter values .",
    "investigations of the stability of the steady states by means of numerical simulations are given in section  [ sect : stability ] .",
    "discussions and conclusions , including a detailed description of the difference between our model and the one by mclean and graham  @xcite , are given in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "in this section , a continuum mechanical model for the growth of an axon is derived .",
    "any modelling methodology for capturing a biological or physical phenomenon has to start by making idealizing assumptions . in neuronal physiology",
    "it is a known fact that the growth of a newborn axon is strictly connected to the presence of the group of proteins called tubulin .",
    "the main idealizing assumption is that tubulin is the only substance involved in the growth of an axon .",
    "another idealizing assumption is that the molecules of free tubulin are so small that one can consider them as a homogeneous continuum .",
    "then the physical conservation law of mass can be used to derive differential equations that govern the dynamic behaviour of the concentration of tubulin both along the axon and in the growth cone .",
    "finally , some constitutive assumptions have to be introduced to couple and thereby reduce the number of unknown variables so that a solution of the equations can be obtained .",
    "such constitutive assumptions are based on physical and biological facts as far as possible .          in figure",
    "[ fig : growing_axon ] , an idealized axon is shown .",
    "the one - dimensional @xmath0-axis is placed along the axon , which at time @xmath1  [ s ] has the length @xmath2  [ m ] .",
    "the latter variable is one output of the model .",
    "the effective cross - sectional area of the axon through which tubulin is transported is assumed to be a constant denoted by @xmath3  [ m@xmath4 .",
    "another output of the model is the concentration of tubulin along the axon , which is assumed to vary with @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; i.e.  @xmath5  [ mol@xmath6m@xmath7 .",
    "tubulin is produced only in the cell body , the soma , which is placed to the left of @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the time - varying tubulin concentration in the soma @xmath9 is known .",
    "no tubulin is produced along the axon , but degradation occurs at the constant rate @xmath10  [ 1@xmath6s ] .",
    "the tip of the axon , the growth cone , is located to the right of @xmath11 , and has the volume @xmath12  [ m@xmath7 . for simplicity ,",
    "we introduce a characteristic length of the growth cone ; @xmath13 ( it turns out that the final model only contains this ratio ) .",
    "the growth cone is considered to be a completely mixed compartment in which the unknown concentration of tubulin dimers is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "no production of tubulin occurs in the cone , but consumption occurs , partly because of degradation at the constant rate @xmath10  [ 1@xmath6s ] , partly because of the assembly of dimers to microtubules that elongates the axon at a constant rate @xmath15  [ 1@xmath6s ] , i.e. , @xmath15 is the reaction rate of polymerization of guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) bound tubulin dimers to microtubule bound guanosine diphosphate ( gdp ) . as for the polymerization , we let @xmath16  [ m@xmath4 denote the constant effective area of growth and @xmath17  [ mol@xmath6m@xmath7 the density of the assembled microtubules ( the cytoskeleton ) . finally , we assume that the assembled microtubules in the growth cone may disassemble at the constant rate @xmath18  [ @xmath19s ] .",
    "all biological and physical constants are assumed to be non - negative .",
    "the conservation of mass of tubulin states that the rate of increase of mass in an arbitrary interval @xmath20 of the @xmath0-axis equals the mass flux ( mol per unit time ) in minus the flux out plus the production inside the interval : @xmath21 where @xmath22  [ mol@xmath23m@xmath24s@xmath25 is the flux per unit area of tubulin and @xmath26  [ mol@xmath23m@xmath27s@xmath25 is a source / sink modelling local production / consumption in the axon . since only degradation is taken into account , we have @xmath28 .",
    "note that the flux @xmath22 is the product of the concentration @xmath29 and the velocity of tubulin @xmath30  [ m@xmath6s ] : @xmath31    the conservation law yields two dynamic equations . letting the interval @xmath20 shrink to a point @xmath32 one gets the pde ( assuming @xmath29 and @xmath22 are continuously differentiable functions ) : @xmath33 this is one equation with two unknowns ; @xmath29 and @xmath22 ( or @xmath30 ) .",
    "a constitutive assumption is needed .",
    "it is often assumed that the flux of tubulin @xmath22 is determined by active transport by motor proteins having the constant velocity @xmath34  [ m@xmath6s ] and diffusion of free tubulin according to fick s law @xcite .",
    "the constitutive assumption relating the flux @xmath22 and the concentration @xmath29 is @xmath35 where @xmath36  [ m@xmath37s ] is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath38",
    ". substitution of into pde gives the advection - diffusion - reaction equation @xmath39    the conservation of mass should also hold for the growth cone located in the interval @xmath40 . over ( the moving ) right boundary @xmath41 , there is no flux ; however , there is over @xmath11 . to write down this flux from left to right",
    ", we introduce the following notation : @xmath42 which is the concentration just to the left of the boundary @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , we use the notation @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the boundary @xmath11 moves with velocity @xmath45 while the tubulin moves with the velocity @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath44 is higher than @xmath46 , then there is a net inflow of tubulin to the growth cone ; otherwise , there is an outflow .",
    "hence , it is the relative velocity of tubulin @xmath47 that determines whether the net influx is positive or negative .",
    "since the flux ( amount per unit time ) is the product of the net velocity , the concentration and the cross - sectional area , the net flux over @xmath11 in the @xmath0-direction is @xmath48 with the physical law and the constitutive assumption for @xmath22 , the velocity of tubulin can be written @xmath49 substituting this into , we get the flux [ mol@xmath6s ] of tubulin over @xmath11 ( seen by an observer moving with the boundary ) : @xmath50 the conservation of the amount of free tubulin in the growth cone leads to the following ode : @xmath51 we assume that the degradation of free tubulin occurs at the same rate @xmath10 as in the entire axon .",
    "the two last terms describe mass per unit time of the assembly / disassembly ( polymerization / deplymerization ) of microtubules .",
    "the assembled mass per unit time is assumed to be proportional to the available amount of tubulin in the cone @xmath52 with the reaction rate @xmath15 as the proportionality constant .",
    "the disassembly at the rate @xmath18 is a process that reduces the growth rate , and is proportional to the already assembled microtubules , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a dimensionless constant such that @xmath55 is the length of the assembled microtubles that may undergo disassembly .",
    "experimental evidence that this term is independent of the free tubulin concentration has been provided by walker et al .",
    "@xcite .    before simplifying equation",
    ", we note that it contains the two unknown functions @xmath14 and @xmath2 . a relation between these",
    "is needed .",
    "the conservation of the amount of assembled ( polymerized ) tubulin is the following , where the terms on the right - hand side have been explained above ; see the two last terms of : @xmath56 since the density @xmath17 and growth area @xmath16 of assembled microtubules are assumed to be constants , we can divide equation   by @xmath57 and obtain @xmath58 if the concentration of tubulin is too low , this equation yields that the elongation is negative , which means that the axon shrinks . to compare with the notation in the model of mclean and graham  @xcite , who write the equation @xmath59 , we set @xmath60 where @xmath61 is easily interpreted as the maximum speed of shrinkage , which occurs when @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is a sort of rate coefficient for the polymerization ; however , it has not the unit of a rate constant .",
    "it is the proportionality concentration between the resulting elongation speed due to the polymerization and @xmath64 when there is now disassembly .",
    "we also define @xmath65 which is the threshold concentration when @xmath66 , i.e.  when there is no elongation , since the processes of assembly and disassembly are equally large .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 is the steady - state concentration in the growth cone . then can be written @xmath68 thus , @xmath63 is the proportionality constant between the elongation speed and the excess tubulin concentration in the growth cone above the steady - state level @xmath67 .",
    "we now simplify equation   by dividing by @xmath3 , use to introduce @xmath67 and use to express it without @xmath46 : @xmath69      the three model equations are , and , and the unknowns are @xmath70 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 .",

    "therefore , it is natural to impose boundary conditions requiring that the concentration is continuous at @xmath8 and @xmath73 .",

    "* equation  ( 2.3 ) ) for @xmath11 is @xmath345 this introduction of new parameters remove the above implicit assumption that @xmath342 .",
    "however , means that the moving boundary has not been taken into account . to compare with our model , equation   can be seen as a simplification of our ode for the growth cone concentration , which is either , or the second equation of .",
    "namely , setting the size parameter @xmath71 of the growth cone to zero and using @xmath346 , becomes @xmath347 an equivalent way of obtaining this equation is to simply use the conservation of mass over @xmath11 .",
    "seen from an observer moving with the boundary ( to the right along the @xmath0-axis ) , the influx on the left - hand side of @xmath11 is @xmath340 , which is equal to the flux out on the right - hand side , which is zero . substituting the ode for @xmath46 one arrives at .",
    "the differences between the two models ( when the growth cone has zero size ) can now be seen in the differences between and .",
    "firstly , in no new parameter has been introduced , in contrast to @xmath348 and @xmath349 .",
    "secondly , taking the moving boundary into account , one ends up in a nonlinear relation between the concentration @xmath350 and its spatial derivative @xmath43 .",
    "this difference explains why the mg  model yields decreasing concentration profiles along the axon , whereas we get non - monotone ones .",
    "note that we get a non - monotone profile also in the case when @xmath351 ; theorem  [ thm : case1 ] still holds ; see also figure  [ fig : varyg ] . then there is no ode for the growth cone , but instead the boundary condition at @xmath11 for the pde .",
    "hence , it is not the growth cone ode that is responsible for the non - monotone steady - state profile , it is simply the outcome of the conservation law of mass .",
    "one outcome of this work is the presented new dynamic model of tubulin - driven axonal growth .",
    "the input to the model is the tubulin concentration @xmath9 , which we assume is given . except for this function",
    ", the model has seven ( constant ) parameters , which are all biological or physiological parameters or combinations of such .",
    "since we analyze steady - state solutions in this work , @xmath132 has been constant in time .",
    "depending on this value , and the values of five additional parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath10 , @xmath71 , @xmath67 ) , all steady - state solutions have been classified .",
    "one conclusion is that the values of the rate constants @xmath63 and @xmath15 in the dynamic model have no influence on the steady states , hence only on the dynamic behaviour and convergence to steady state .",
    "the biologically most interesting cases arise when all parameters take positive values and these cases are given in theorem  [ thm : case1 ] . with the nominal parameter values ( table  [ table:1 ] ) , which we have extracted directly or indirectly from the biological literature ,",
    "the following inequality is fulfilled : @xmath169 then case  i of theorem  [ thm : case1 ] states that , when a steady state exists , the concentration of tubulin along the axon @xmath189 is given by the explicit formula , but the length @xmath134 has to be obtained numerically by solving the equation @xmath220 with @xmath157 given by .",
    "a way of getting an overview of the possible values of @xmath134 is to plot the graph of the function , which has a minimum at @xmath352  mm ; see figure  [ fig : f ] .",
    "the value on the ratio @xmath218 gives directly whether zero , one or two steady states exist and the corresponding length(s ) @xmath134 can be read off on the @xmath160-axis .",
    "if the ratio @xmath353 , then there exists no steady state , i.e.  no outgrowth can occur . for higher values on @xmath218 ,",
    "the steady - state concentration along the axon is given by the function .",
    "if @xmath354 , then there exists two steady - state solutions .",
    "one has a very short @xmath355  mm , which actually becomes smaller and smaller the closer the ratio @xmath218 is to 1 .",
    "dynamic numerical simulations indicate that this is an unstable steady state and thus not possible biologically .",
    "the other steady state is stable , has a larger @xmath356  mm , and this value is larger the larger @xmath218 is .",
    "when @xmath200 , there exists a unique steady - state solution .",
    "numerical simulations of the dynamic behaviour in section  [ sect : stability ] indicate that every steady - state solution with @xmath356  mm is stable , whereas the shorter ones are unstable .",
    "an overall conclusions is thus that for the most interesting cases when @xmath184 and @xmath357 hold , there exists a unique stable steady - state solution . for an axon of arbitrary length , if the soma concentration decreases to a constant value such that @xmath358 , then there exists no steady - state solution and dynamic numerical simulations show a shrinking axon .",
    "one interesting outcome from the model is the form of the concentration distribution @xmath189 along the axon for the stable steady states in case  i of theorem  [ thm : case1 ] .",
    "starting from the soma at @xmath8 , the concentration decreases and is in fact along a large portion of the axon lower than both @xmath132 and the steady - state soma concentration @xmath67 .",
    "the explanation for this form is hard to make intuitively , since it is a result of the combined effects of active transport , diffusion , degradation , ( dis)assembly of tubulin and the velocity of the growth cone .",
    "the mathematical equations combine these phenomena and yield the very form of @xmath189 , which is given explicitly by the closed - form expression .",
    "this is a good example of the purpose and strength of mathematical modelling ; it is impossible to reason biologically what the precise form of a steady - state solution should be .",
    "an interesting biological conclusion , which is in agreement with experimental results , is that a relatively large active transport velocity @xmath34 means that the _ flux _ is sufficiently large to transport tubulin the long way out to the growth cone despite the relatively low _ concentration _ of tubulin in the axon . along the axon ,",
    "the two flux components , advective and diffusive , are precisely balanced by the degradation of tubulin .",
    "note that the total flux ( advective plus diffusive ) is decreasing along the axon because of the degradation .",
    "the increasing concentration distribution near the growth cone implies that diffusion occurs in the direction to the soma but the active transport to the growth cone is so large that the net flux is precisely what is needed to balance the degradation of tubulin in the growth cone .",
    "note also that we have assumed that the concentration of tubulin varies continuously due to the presence of diffusion .",
    "if the active transport velocity @xmath34 is too low , namely less than @xmath359 ( case  ii of theorem  [ thm : case1 ] ) , then there still exists a unique solution ; however , the concentration along the axon @xmath189 is decreasing , which partly means that the diffusion flux is always directed towards to growth cone , and partly that this solution only exists if the soma concentration @xmath205 .",
    "the model gives information also in the extreme cases when one or more parameters are zero .",
    "the biological interest in such cases is if the corresponding variable(s ) are negligible .",
    "the mathematical advantage to set a very small variable to zero , is that in some cases one gets special solutions that can be written up explicitly which makes it easier to draw biological conclusions .",
    "when advection is negligible ( @xmath244 ) , the flux of tubulin from the soma to the growth cone is only present in the form of diffusion .",
    "since diffusive flux occurs from higher to lower concentrations , the only possible steady state has a decreasing concentration of tubulin from the soma to the growth cone , which is precisely what theorem  [ thm : case2 ] states .",
    "this theorem also states that if the soma concentration is too small ( @xmath257 ) , there exists no steady state with @xmath137 .",
    "another extreme case is when the degradation of tubulin is negligible ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : case3 ] states that a steady state exists if and only if @xmath257 holds .",
    "then there is no net flux at any @xmath0 along the axon ; i.e.the concentration @xmath189 is increasing in such away that the advective flux towards the growth cone is equal to the diffusive flux back to the soma .",
    "if @xmath360 , then there exists no steady state and the the axon may grow indefinitely .",
    "the case when diffusion is negligible ( @xmath265 ) is a special case ; however , not an unrealistic case , since @xmath36 is a relatively small number . without diffusion ,",
    "the solution of the pde may in fact contain discontinuities .",
    "hence , the continuity assumption we have made for the boundary conditions is not natural . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", one can not beforehand ignore the possibility of a concentration discontinuity at @xmath11 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ssdisc ] gives explicit functions for both the decreasing concentration profile along the axon and the length of the axon in the unique steady state .",
    "note that the decreasing concentration along the axon agrees with the general case except near the growth cone .",
    "we also note that the steady state exists if and only if @xmath361 , i.e. , when the advective flux ( @xmath362 ) from the soma is greater than the degradation of tubulin in the growth cone ( @xmath363 ) . the difference between these two numbers is precisely the amount per time unit of transported tubulin along the axon that is degraded .",
    "we have not found ( in literature ) any experimental indications against the non - monotone concentration distribution of tubulin along the axon which our model yields for the nominal parameter values .",
    "it is in agreement with the fact that the active transport is the most important ingredient for the outgrowth of long axons .",
    "the velocity @xmath34 of the active transport has been assumed to be constant .",
    "experiments reported by watson et al .",
    "@xcite and xu and tung  @xcite show a decreasing velocity along fully grown axons ; i.e. @xmath364 is a decreasing function .",
    "although such a dependence could be included in the model , it is not clear what causes this decrease and hence what function @xmath365 to use .",
    "more comprehensive future extensions of the model would be to include other substances than tubulin , for example , actin which is redistributed within the growth cone so that it can turn as a response to external stimuli .",
