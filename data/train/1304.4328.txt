    "planets and brown dwarfs discovered around intermediate - mass stars ( 1.55@xmath0 ) have been growing in number for the last decade .",
    "hundreds of gk giants and subgiants , which are evolved counterparts of intermediate - mass ba dwarfs , have been intensively surveyed in radial velocity by utilizing their spectral features appropriate to precise radial velocity measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . more than 50 substellar companions have been discovered around such evolved intermediate - mass stars , which are ranging from 0.6 to 40 @xmath9 in minimum mass , from 0.08 to 6 au in semimajor axis , and from 0 to 0.68 in eccentricity .",
    "planets less massive than 2@xmath9 were mostly found around subgiants because giants normally show larger stellar jitter of 1020 m s@xmath8 making detection of low mass planets more difficult ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and all of the companions except for only one hot - jupiter around a subgiant ( @xcite ) were found in orbits beyond 0.6 au .",
    "not only single planets but also multiple - planet systems have been found , some of which are in mean - motion resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently direct imaging succeeded in detecting substellar companions in wide orbits around ba dwarfs , which are complementary to radial velocity observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital properties of these companions now serve as test cases for general understanding of formation and evolution of substellar companions around intermediate - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the okayama planet search program is one of the long - continued planet search programs and has been regularly monitoring radial velocities of about 300 intermediate - mass gk giants since 2001 at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) in japan ( @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 20 planets and 6 brown dwarfs have been discovered so far at oao including those found in collaboration with xinglong observatory in china , bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory in korea , subaru 8.2 m telescope in hawaii , and australian astronomical observatory .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    from the planet search program , here",
    "we report the discovery of three new planetary companions around gk giants .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the observations in section [ obs ] and the stellar properties are presented in section [ stpara ] .",
    "analyses of radial velocity , period search , orbital solution , stellar activity , and line shape variation are described in section [ ana ] and the results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "section [ discussion ] and [ summary ] are devoted to discussion and summary , respectively .",
    "all of the observations were made with the 1.88 m reflector and the high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; @xcite ) at oao . in 2007 december",
    ", hides was upgraded from single ccd ( 2k@xmath104k ) to a mosaic of three ccds , which enables us to simultaneously obtain spectra with a wavelength range of 37507500@xmath11 using a red cross - disperser .",
    "furthermore , the high - efficiency fiber - link system with an image slicer has been available for hides since 2010 , which makes overall throughput more than twice than that with the conventional slit observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we basically obtained the data presented in this paper using the slit ( hereafter hides - slit ) mode , but we also used the fiber - link ( hereafter hides - fiber ) mode for two of the three stars .    in the hides - slit mode ,",
    "the slit width was set to 200 @xmath12 m ( @xmath13 ) giving a spectral resolution ( @xmath14 ) of 67000 by about 3.3 pixels sampling . in the hides - fiber mode ,",
    "the width of the sliced image is @xmath15 corresponding to a spectral resolution of @xmath1655000 by about 3.8 pixels sampling .",
    "each observing mode uses its own iodine absorption cell ( i@xmath17 cell ; @xcite ) for precise radial velocity measurements , which provides a fiducial wavelength reference in a wavelength range of 50005800@xmath11 .",
    "possible offset in radial velocities between the two modes caused by using the different i@xmath17 cells is treated as a free parameter in orbital fitting ( see section [ orbit ] ) .",
    "the reduction of echelle data ( i.e. bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered - light subtraction , and spectrum extraction ) is performed using the iraf software package in the standard way .",
    "atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature @xmath18 , surface gravity @xmath19 , micro - turbulent velocity @xmath20 , fe abundance [ fe / h ] , and projected rotational velocity @xmath21 ) of all the targets for okayama planet search program were derived by @xcite , based on the measured equivalent widths of well - behaved fe i and fe ii lines of iodine - free stellar spectra .",
    "details of the procedure and resultant parameters are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they also obtained the absolute magnitude @xmath22 of each star from the apparent @xmath23-band magnitude and hipparcos parallax @xmath24 ( @xcite ) correcting interstellar extinction @xmath25 from @xcite s table , and obtained the bolometric correction @xmath26 based on the @xcite s theoretical calculation .",
    "the luminosity @xmath27 and mass @xmath28 of each star were derived using these parameters and theoretical evolutionary tracks of @xcite , and the stellar radius @xmath29 was derived by the stefan - boltzmann relationship and the measured @xmath27 and @xmath18 .",
    "the properties of the three stars presented in this paper ( hd 2952 , hd 120084 , @xmath1 ser ) are summarized in table [ tbl - stars ] , and the stars are plotted on the hr diagram in figure [ fig - hrd ] .",
    "the three stars are known to be stable in photometry to a level of @xmath30 mag ( @xcite ) , and they are chromospherically inactive with no significant emission in the core of ca ii hk lines as shown in figure [ fig - cah ] .",
    "since we can obtain spectra covering ca ii hk lines together with radial velocity data after installing 3 ccds in 2007 , we use the lines to check stellar chromospheric activity correlated with radial velocity variations ( see section [ activity ] ) .",
    "radial velocity analysis was carried out using the modeling technique of an i@xmath17-superposed stellar spectrum detailed in @xcite and @xcite , which is based on the method by @xcite . in the technique ,",
    "an i@xmath17-superposed stellar spectrum is modeled as a product of a high resolution i@xmath17 and a stellar template spectrum convolved with a modeled instrumental profile ( ip ) of the spectrograph .",
    "we here used a stellar template that was obtained by deconvolving a pure stellar spectrum with the spectrograph ip estimated from an i@xmath17-superposed b - star or flat spectrum .",
    "we applied the stellar template thus obtained with hides - slit mode observations to radial velocity analysis for the data taken with hides - fiber mode as well as hides - slit mode .",
    "we took account of a velocity offset , @xmath31rv@xmath32 , between the two observing modes as a free parameter when we determine orbital parameters ( see section [ orbit ] ) .",
    "measurement error in radial velocity was estimated from an ensemble of velocities from each of @xmath33300 spectral regions ( each @xmath333@xmath11 long ) in every exposure .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis ( @xcite ) was performed to search for periodicity in radial velocity data , and false alarm probability ( @xmath34 ) was estimated to assess the significance of the periodicity . to estimate the @xmath34",
    ", we created 10@xmath35 fake datasets , in which the observed radial velocities were randomly redistributed , keeping fixed the observation time , and applied the same periodogram analysis to them .",
    "the fraction of fake datasets exhibiting a periodogram power higher than the observed one was adopted as a @xmath34 for the signal .",
    "keplerian orbital model for the radial velocity data and uncertainties for the parameters were derived using the bayesian markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the details of the method are presented in the literatures , we here briefly describe the procedure and parameters for the model adopted in this paper .    in bayes theorem ,",
    "the target joint probability distribution , the posterior probability distribution , for parameters of a certain model @xmath28 based on observational data and prior background information @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normalization constant , @xmath39 is the prior probability distribution of , and @xmath40 is the likelihood , which is the probability that we would have obtained the data given the parameters , model @xmath28 , and priors @xmath36 .",
    "the likelihood function is given by @xmath41\\\\ a & = & \\prod_j\\left(2\\pi\\right)^{-n_j/2}\\prod_{i=1}^{n_j}\\left(\\sigma_{i , j}^2+s_j^2\\right)^{-1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the number of data points for the @xmath43th instrument , @xmath44 is the measurement uncertainties for each point , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are observed and modeled radial velocities , respectively .",
    "extra gaussian noise @xmath47 is incorporated for observations with @xmath43th instrument , including intrinsic stellar jitter such as stellar oscillation and unknown noise source , in addition to the measurement uncertainties .    for a single planet ,",
    "reflex motion in stellar radial velocity at time @xmath48 observed with @xmath43th instrument can be expressed as @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is systematic velocity with reference to @xmath43th instrument , @xmath51 , @xmath1 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is velocity semiamplitude , argument of periastron , eccentricity , and orbital period , respectively .",
    "@xmath54 is true anomaly of the planet at @xmath48 , which is a function of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and time of periastron passage @xmath55 . instead of @xmath55 , we here adopted @xmath56 , fraction of an orbit of the planet prior to the start of data taking , at which periastron occurred .    for the prior probability distribution",
    ", we follwed @xcite adopting jeffrey s prior for @xmath53 , modified jeffrey s prior for @xmath51 and @xmath47 , and uniform one for other parameters .",
    "then , joint prior for the model parameters , assuming independence , is given by @xmath57}\\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\prod_j\\frac{1}{v_{j , max}-v_{j , min}}\\frac{1}{(s_j+s_a)\\ln[(s_a+s_{max})/s_a]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter priors we adopted are summarized in table [ tbl - priors ] .    the posterior probability distribution was obtained with the mcmc method , which uses a stochastic process to generate a `` chain '' of points in parameter space that approximates the desired probability distribution . the chain is derived from an initial point by iterating a `` jump function '' , which was the addition of a gaussian random number to each parameter value in our case .",
    "if the new set of parameters has a larger posterior probability @xmath58 than that for the previous set of parameters @xmath59 , the jump is executed and the new parameters are accepted ; if not , the jump is only executed with probability @xmath60 ; otherwise , the previous parameters are recorded .",
    "we set the relative sizes of the gaussian perturbations based on the 1@xmath61 uncertainties estimated on ahead with the bootstrap method , and required the overall acceptance rate of @xmath3325% , which is the total fraction of jumps executed , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "we generated 5 independent chains , each of which started from random initial values 5@xmath61 away from the best - fit ones .",
    "each chain had @xmath62@xmath63 points , the first 10% or 500,000 of which were discarded to minimize the effect of the initial condition . to check the convergence and the consistency between the chains",
    ", we computed gelman - rubbin statistic ( @xcite ) for each parameter , which is a comparison between the interchain variance and the intrachain variance , and confirmed that the results were within a few percent of unity , a sign of good mixing and convergence .",
    "we also calculated an estimate of the effective number of independent draws following @xcite and confirmed that the value was larger than 1000 .",
    "the resultant chains were merged to derive the final joint posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "we derived the median value of the pdf for each parameter and set the 1@xmath61 uncertainty as the range between 15.87% and 84.13% of the pdf .",
    "rotational modulation of spots or activity cycle of stars cause apparent variations in stellar radial velocities , which can masquerade as a planetary signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is important to check the activity level of stars together with radial velocity variations . for this purpose , ca ii hk lines are widely used as activity indicators since the flux of the line cores is a good tracer of chromospheric activity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we here define ca ii h index @xmath64 as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a total flux in a wavelength bin 0.66@xmath11 wide centered on the h line , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are those in bins 1.1 @xmath11 wide centered on minus and plus 1.2 @xmath11 from the center of the h line , respectively . by setting the reference wavelength bands ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath29 , close to the base of the caii h line core in this way , we tried to minimize the error in @xmath64 caused by imperfect normalization of the continuum level .",
    "we obtained the @xmath64 values only for spectra with s / n of @xmath66 over @xmath3340 among those taken after 2007 .",
    "to investigate other possible causes of apparent radial velocity variations rather than orbital motion , spectral line shape analysis was performed using ip - deconvolved stellar templates .",
    "details of the analysis are described in @xcite and @xcite , and here we briefly summarize the procedure .",
    "at first , two ip - deconvolved templates were extracted from five i@xmath17-superposed stellar spectra at nearly the phases of maximum and minimum in observed radial velocities using the technique by @xcite .",
    "cross correlation profiles of the two templates were then derived for about 100 spectral segments ( 45@xmath11 width each ) that have no severely blended or broad lines in them .",
    "three bisector quantities were calculated for the cross correlation profile for each segment : the velocity span ( bvs ) , the velocity difference between two flux levels of the bisector ; the velocity curvature ( bvc ) , the difference of the velocity span of the upper and lower half of the bisector ; and the velocity displacement ( bvd ) , the average of the bisector at three different flux levels .",
    "flux levels of 25% , 50% , and 75% of the cross correlation profile were used to calculate the above three quantities .",
    "both the bvs and the bvc being identical to zero and the average bvd agreeing with the velocity difference between the two templates ( @xmath70 ) suggest that the cross correlation profiles can be considered to be symmetric . thus the observed radial velocity variations are considered to be caused by parallel shifts of the spectral lines rather than deformation of them , which favors the orbital motion hypothesis .",
    "we collected a total of 63 radial velocity data of hd 2952 between 2004 january and 2012 december using both of hides - slit and hides - fiber mode .",
    "we obtained a signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath71100260 pix@xmath8 at 5500@xmath11 with an exposure time 7801800 sec using hides - slit mode and s / n@xmath71200320 pix@xmath8 at 5500@xmath11 with an exposure time 450900 sec using hides - fiber mode .",
    "the observed radial velocities are shown in figure [ fig - hd2952 ] and are listed in table [ tbl - hd2952 ] together with their estimated uncertainties .",
    "lomb - scargle periodogram of the data exhibits a dominant single peak at a period of 313 days with @xmath72 .",
    "the orbital parameters for single keplerian model derived by mcmc method are @xmath73 days , @xmath74 m s@xmath8 , and @xmath75 , which are median and 68.3% credible regions for pdf .",
    "the resulting keplerian model is shown in figure [ fig - hd2952 ] overplotted on the velocities , whose error bars include the median value of the derived stellar jitter of @xmath76 m s@xmath8 and @xmath77 m s@xmath8 for hides - slit and hides - fiber mode , respectively .",
    "the rms scatter of the residuals to the keplerian fit was 12.4 m s@xmath8 and we found no significant periodicity in the residuals at this stage , although some possible long - term trend is apparently seen . adopting a stellar mass of 2.54 @xmath0 , we obtain a minimum mass @xmath2 and a semimajor axis @xmath78 au for the orbiting planet .",
    "we did not find any significant variations in ca ii h index ( figure [ fig - hd2952_caii ] ) and spectral line profiles correlated with the orbital period ( table [ tbl - bisector ] ) .",
    "we obtained a total of 33 radial velocity data of hd 120084 between 2003 march and 2012 december using hides - slit mode with s / n@xmath7175230 pix@xmath8 at 5500@xmath11 by an exposure time 9001800 sec .",
    "the observed radial velocities are shown in figure [ fig - hd120084 ] and are listed in table [ tbl - hd120084 ] together with their estimated uncertainties .",
    "lomb - scargle periodogram of the data exhibits a peak at around a period of 1840 days .",
    "the @xmath34 of peak is 0.06 , which is not significant because of the long period , limited phase coverage , and deviation from sinusoidal curve for the radial velocity variations .",
    "the single keplerian model for the data and uncertainties for each orbital parameter were derived by mcmc method .",
    "the median values and the 68.3% credible regions for orbital parameters are @xmath79 d , @xmath80 m s@xmath8 , and @xmath81 .",

    "figure [ fig - ekhd120084 ] shows 2-dimensional pdf between @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as seen in the figure ,",
    "the parameters are not well constrained yet because the phase of velocity minimum was not covered by our observations",
    ". however , the companion minimum - mass is below 13 @xmath9 with 99% confidence , then the companion still falls into the planetary regime .",
    "we did not analyze ca ii h variations for the star because of the low s / n ratio for the core of the observed spectra .",
    "we did not find any significant variations in spectral line profiles correlated with the orbital period ( table [ tbl - bisector ] ) .",
    "probable periodic radial velocity variations of @xmath1 ser were first reported in @xcite at an early time of the okayama planet search program .",

    "figure [ fig - hd120048_caii ] shows the variations in @xmath64 values for the star against radial velocity variations .",
    "it clearly shows that the radial velocity variations are correlated with activity level , indicating that the index can be used to investigate a cause of radial velocity variations .",
    "we also performed spectral line shape analysis for hd 120048 in the same manner as those for other three stars .",
    "as presented in table [ tbl - bisector ] , no significant variations are detected for the star along with the other three stars .",
    "it suggests that spectral line shape variations caused by rotational modulation are too small to be detected by the current method or the observed radial velocity variations in hd 120048 originate from atmospheric motion ( expansion or contraction ) that are not necessarily accompanied by significant line profile variations .",

    "hd 2952 b ( @xmath2 , @xmath78 au ) and @xmath1 ser b ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 au ) are the least massive planets ever discovered around intermediate - mass ( 1.55@xmath0 ) giants together with hd 100655 b ( @xmath89 ; @xcite ) and @xmath91 crb b ( @xmath92 ; @xcite ) .",
    "less massive planets are also found around low - mass ( @xmath931.5@xmath0 ) k giants such as bd+48 738 b ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is normally more difficult to detect planets with @xmath96 around such giants because of the relatively larger stellar jitter .",
    "however , these discoveries demonstrate that it is still possible to detect such less massive planets even around gk giants by high cadence observations .",
    "how low mass planets are detectable around gk giants ?",
    "@xcite conducted asteroseismic observations for some of the g giants in our sample and detected solar - like oscillations in them .",
    "the results show that the stellar jitter of the giants are primarily dominated by solar - like oscillations with periods of 310 hours and integrated velocity amplitudes of 1020 m s@xmath8 , which are consistent with jitters in longer timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of solar - type dwarfs ,",
    "the p - mode oscillations have much shorter periods ( @xmath33 10 minutes ) and smaller velocity amplitudes ( @xmath97 m s@xmath8 ) , which can be canceled out down to @xmath3320 cm s@xmath8 by integration for @xmath98 minutes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig - jitter ] demonstrates the benefit by applying the similar strategy to the radial velocity data presented in @xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , the scatters are reduced by a factor of 24 by binning the data over one night ( @xmath99 hr ) , which makes the detection limit of planets down to below 1 @xmath9 at 1 au and even super - earth class planets in short period orbits around stars like @xmath100 her ( g8iii - iv ) .",
    "although it takes time to apply this strategy to all of our targets and the jitters may have various time scales in variations , the results show that we can potentially reduce the detection limit of planets around giants if we mitigate the effect of stellar jitters by proper observational strategy .",
    "hd 120084 b ( @xmath5 , @xmath82 au ) is a long - period eccentric planet .",
    "the eccentricity exceeds 0.4 with the 99% confidence , while almost all the planets discovered around evolved intermediate - mass stars have eccentricity below 0.4 ( figure [ fig - ecc ] ) .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed for the origin of eccentric planets including planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and secular perturbations by an outer body ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in both of which we can expect to find a distant companion . in order to explore such a possible distant companion around hd 120084 , we performed mcmc analysis for a single keplerian model with a linear velocity trend @xmath101 . as a result",
    ", we constrained the velocity trend to be @xmath102 m s@xmath8 yr@xmath8 with 99% confidence , giving an order - of - magnitude relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the companion mass , @xmath105 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath106 is the orbital radius . the result could exclude existence of a brown - dwarf companion ( @xmath107 ) within @xmath3336 au and a stellar one ( @xmath108 ) within @xmath3390 au .",
    "it may also be possible to assume that ( unobserved ) another body was scattered into inner orbit and then engulfed by the central star .",
    "recently @xcite reported a possible example for this case ; bd+48 740 , a lithium rich giant with a possible planetary companion in an eccentric and long - period orbit .",
    "it has been proposed for years that the planet engulfment scenario is an origin of existence of lithium overabundant giants ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and adamow et al . suggested that bd+48 740 might be the case .",
    "we determined lithium abundance @xmath109(li ) ] for hd 120084 using the spectral synthesis method with the idl / fortran siu software package developed by reetz ( 1993 , private communication ) .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is presented by a single gaussian profile , convolved with the broadening function of stellar rotation , macroturbulence and instrumental profile .",
    "the lithium abundance is obtained by fitting the synthetic spectrum for @xmath110 to the observed one with the contribution of the line of fei 6707.467@xmath11 taken into account .",
    "we then obtained @xmath109(li)@xmath111 for hd 120084 , which does not exhibit overabundance of lithium compared with other giants in our sample .",
    "details of the procedure as well as lithium abundances for other targets of our planet - search survey can be found in liu et al .",

    "here we reported three new planetary systems around evolved intermediate - mass stars from precise radial velocity measurements at oao .",
    "these add to the diversity of planets around evolved intermediate - mass stars in terms of less massive planets than @xmath112 ( hd 2952 b , @xmath1 ser b ) and a highly eccentric planet with @xmath7 ( hd 120084 b ) .",
    "the okayama planet search program has been continuously monitoring radial velocity of about 300 gk giants for 12 years , which corresponds to orbital semimajor axis of 6.5 au around 2@xmath0 stars . furthermore , since 2010 , the high - efficiency fiber - link system for hides has been available .",

    "<S> we also show that radial velocity variations of stellar oscillations for g giants can be averaged out below a level of a few m s@xmath8 at least in timescale of a week by high cadence observations , which enables us to detect a super - earth and a neptune - mass planet in short - period orbits even around such giant stars . </S>"
