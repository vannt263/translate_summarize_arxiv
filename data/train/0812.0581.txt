    "content distribution is today at the core of the services provided by the internet . however , distributing content to a large audience is costly with a classical client - server or cdn solution .",
    "this is the reason why content providers start to move to 2p content distribution that enables to significantly reduce their cost without penalizing the experience of users .",
    "one striking example is iplayer , a 2p service for video - on - demand that distributes recent bbc programs .",
    "however , whereas current 2p content distribution solutions like bittorrent are very efficient , they generate a huge amount of traffic on inter - isp links .",
    "indeed , in bittorrent , each peer that downloads a given content is connected to a small subset of peers picked at random among all the peers that download that content .",
    "in fact , even though peers in the same isp are downloading the same content they are not necessarily connected to each other . as a consequence ,",
    "peers unnecessarily download most of the content from peers located outside of their isp .",
    "therefore , even if current 2p content replication solutions significantly reduce content provider costs , they can not be promoted as a global solution for content replication as they induce huge costs for isps . in particular , the current trend for isps is to block 2p traffic  @xcite .",
    "one solution to this problem is to use 2p locality , that is to constrain 2p traffic within isps boundaries in order to minimize the amount of inter - isp traffic .    the seminal work of karagiannis et al .",
    "@xcite is the first one to suggest the use of locality in a 2p system in order to reduce the load on inter - isp links .",
    "they show on real traces the potential for locality ( in particular spatial and temporal correlation in the requests for contents ) and , based on simulation on a bittorrent tracker log , they evaluate the benefit of several architectures and in particular a 2p architecture exploiting locality .",
    "more recently , xie et al .",
    "@xcite proposed p4p , an architecture to enable cooperation between 2p applications and isps .",
    "they show by performing large field tests that p4p enables reduction of external traffic for a monitored isp and enables a reduction on the peers download completion time .",
    "choffnes et al .",
    "@xcite proposed ono , a bittorrent extension that leverages on a cdn infrastructure to localize peers in order to group peers that are close to each other .",
    "they show the benefit of ono in terms of peers download completion time and suggest , using indirect measurements ( ip hops and as hops among peers ) , that ono can also reduce inter - isp traffic .    with those works",
    ", there is no doubt that 2p locality has some benefits and that there are several ways to implement it .",
    "however , two fundamental questions are left unanswered by those previous works .    * _ how far can we push locality ? _ in all proposed solutions the number of inter - isp connections is kept high enough to guarantee a good robustness to partitions , i.e. , a lack of connectivity among set of peers resulting in a poor download completion time .",
    "however , this robustness is at the expense of a larger inter - isp traffic .",
    "how far can we push locality without impacting the robustness to partition of the 2p protocol ?",
    "* _ what is , at the scale of the internet , the reduction of traffic that can be achieved with locality ?",
    "_ it might be argued that 2p locality will bring little benefits at the scale of the internet , in case most isps have just a few peers , thus few potential benefits with peers locality .",
    "therefore , the question is , what is the distribution of peers per isp in the internet , and what would be the inter - isp bandwidth savings achieved with a locality policy .",
    "previous works looking at inter - isp bandwidth savings either consider indirect measurements ( like the distribution of the number of as between connected peers ) , partial measurements ( like the monitoring of a specific isp ) , or simulations ( like comparing various content distribution scenarios based on the location of peers obtained from a tracker log ) . for instance , xie et al .",
    "@xcite reported results on inter - isp savings with p4p for a _ single _ isp .",
    "the answers to those questions are fundamental if ever 2p content replication is used by content providers for large scale distribution . in that case",
    ", it is likely that isps will need to know the amount of inter - isp traffic they can save with locality , and that they will request content providers to minimize this traffic due to 2p applications accordingly . at the same time",
    ", the content providers will need a clear understanding of the impact of this reduction of traffic on their customers .",
    "our contribution in this paper is to answer those questions by running extensive large scale experiments ( with up to @xmath0 real bittorrent clients ) in a controlled environment , and by using real data we crawled in the internet on @xmath1 torrents representing @xmath2 unique peers spread among @xmath3 ases .",
    "our work can be summarized with the two following key contributions .",
    "\\i ) we show that we can push locality much further than what was previously proposed , which enables to reduce by several orders of magnitude the inter - isp traffic and to keep the peers download completion time low . in particular ,",
    "we show on experiments including real world data that the reduction of inter - isp traffic and the peers download completion time are not significantly impacted by the torrent size , the number of peers per isp , and the churn .",
    "finally , we propose new strategies to improve the efficiency and robustness of our locality policy on challenging scenarios defined from real world torrents .",
    "\\ii ) we show that at the scale of the @xmath1 torrents we crawled , isps can largely benefit from locality . in particular ,",
    "whereas all the torrents crawled generated @xmath4 petabytes of inter - isp traffic , high locality would have saved @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 petabytes , of inter - isp traffic .",
    "this results is significantly different from the inter - isp bandwidth savings reported by xie et al",
    "indeed , they reported a reduction of inter - isp traffic with p4p around @xmath7 , but for a single isp with a single large torrent .",
    "thus , they did not evaluated the reduction of traffic at the scale of the internet , but for a single isp .",
    "the result we report is an estimation for @xmath1 real torrents spread across @xmath3 ases , thus capturing the variety of torrent sizes and distribution of peers per as we can find in the internet .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the locality policy we use for our evaluation in section  [ sec : method - locality ] , then we describe our experimental setup , and define metrics in section  [ method ] .",
    "we discuss the impact of the number of inter - isp connections in section  [ locality ] and focus on a small number of inter - isp connections in section  [ small ] . in section  [ sec : real - world - scenarios ] , we present results obtained from a large crawl of torrents in the internet . in section  [ work ] , we discuss the related work . finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we make a experimental evaluation of the two questions discussed in the introduction . to do so , we introduce in the following a locality policy that we use to perform our evaluation .",
    "we do not claim our locality policy to be a definitive solution that should be deployed .",
    "instead , it is a simple implementation that we used for our evaluation .",
    "yet , we identified two important strategies that we recommend to consider , even in a modified form , for any implementation of a locality policy .    in the following , we refer to _ policy _ when the tracker does not implement our locality policy , but the regular random policy .",
    "we say that a connection is _ inter - isp _ when two peers in two different isps have established a direct connection , and that it is _ intra - isp _ when the two peers are from the same isp .",
    "the goal of our _ locality policy _ is to limit the number of inter - isp connections , the higher the locality , the smaller the number of inter - isp connections .",
    "we say that an inter - isp connection is _ outgoing _ ( resp .",
    "_ incoming _ ) for an isp if the connection was initiated by a peer inside ( resp . outside ) this isp .",
    "however , once a connection is established it is fully bidirectional .    in order to control the number of inter - isp connections , we assume that the tracker can map each peer to its isp .",
    "how this mapping is performed is orthogonal to our work .",
    "for instance , the tracker can simply map peers to ases using precomputed mapping information obtained from bgp tables @xcite . in case",
    "the as level is not appropriate for isps , the tracker can use more sophisticated information as the one offered by , for instance , the p4p infrastructure @xcite .",
    "the only one parameter of our locality policy is the _ maximum number of outgoing inter - isp connections per isp_. the tracker maintains for each isp the number of peers outside this isp that it returned to peers inside , along with the identity of the peers inside . this way",
    "the tracker maintains a reasonable approximation of the number of outgoing inter - isp connections for each isp .",
    "when a peer @xmath8 asks the tracker for a new list of peers , the tracker will : map this peer to the isp @xmath9 it belongs to ; return to this peer a list of peers inside @xmath9 ; if the maximum number of outgoing inter - isp connections per isp is not yet reached for @xmath9 , return one additional peer @xmath10 outside @xmath9 and increment by one the counter of the number of outgoing connections for @xmath9 .",
    "we also add a randomization factor to distribute the outgoing connections evenly among the peers of each isp .",
    "each regular client contacts periodically , typically every @xmath11 minutes , the tracker to return statistics .",
    "each time a peer leaves the torrent , it contacts the tracker so that it can remove this peer from the list of peers in the torrent . in case the client does not contact the tracker when it leaves ( for instance , due to a crash of the client ) , the tracker will automatically remove the peer after a predefined period of time , typically @xmath12 minutes , after the last connection of the peer to the tracker .",
    "our locality policy uses this information to maintain an up - to - date list of the number of outgoing inter - isp connections per isp .",
    "when the tracker implements our locality policy , it applies the locality policy to all peers except the initial seed .",
    "because the goal of the initial seed is to improve diversity , the tracker selects the neighbors of the initial seed using the policy .",
    "however , we apply the locality policy to all the other seeds , that is all the leechers that become seed during the experiments .",
    "note that the traffic generated by the initial seed is negligible compared to the aggregated traffic of the torrent .",
    "our locality policy controls the number of outgoing inter - isp connections per isp .",
    "when a peer @xmath8 from the isp @xmath9 opens a new connection to a peer @xmath10 from the isp @xmath13 , the connection is outgoing for @xmath9 , but incoming for @xmath13 .",
    "as both outgoing and incoming connections account for the total number of inter - isp connections , it is important to define a strategy for the selection of peer @xmath10 returned by the tracker to peer @xmath8 .",
    "we define two strategies to select this peer @xmath10 .",
    "the first strategy , the default one , consists in selecting @xmath10 at random among all peers outside @xmath9 . while this strategy is straightforward , it has the notable drawback that the largest isps have a higher probability to have a peer selected than other ones .",
    "therefore , large isps will have more incoming connections than small ones .",
    "thus , it is likely that in this case , as connections are bidirectional , the inter - isp traffic will be higher for large isps ( we confirm this intuition in section  [ sec : impact - locality - real ] ) . in the second strategy that we call round robin ( rr )",
    ", the tracker selects first the isp with a round robin policy and then selects a peer at random in the selected isp .",
    "this way , the probability to select a peer in a given isp is independent of the size of this isp .    in scenarios with a same number of peers for each isp , both strategies are equivalent",
    "therefore , as all the experiments in section  [ locality ] and  [ small ] consider an homogeneous number of peers for each isp , we only present the results with the default strategy .",
    "we perform a detailed evaluation of the rr strategy in section  [ sec : real - world - scenarios ] .      one issue with a small number of inter - isp connections is the higher probability to have partitions in the torrent .",
    "indeed , if peers who have inter - isp connections leave the torrent and no new peer joins the isp , then this isp will form a partition . in order to repair partitions",
    "we introduce an additional strategy called partition merging ( pm ) strategy .",
    "the problem of partition in is not specific to our locality policy , but any locality policy favors its apparition .",
    "the implementation of the partition merging strategy is the following . on the client side , each leecher monitors the pieces received by all its neighbors using the regular have messages .",
    "if during a period of time randomly selected in @xmath14 $ ] , with @xmath15 initialized to @xmath16 , the leecher can not find any piece it needs among all its neighbors ( i.e. , each neighbor has a subset of the pieces of the leecher ) , it recontacts the tracker with a pm flag , which means that the leecher believes there is a partition and that it needs a connection to a new peer outside its isp . in case",
    "the tracker does not return a new peer , or if after receiving this new peer the leecher does not observe any new piece it needs , the leecher performs an exponential backoff of @xmath15 , that is @xmath17 .",
    "as soon as the leecher sees among its neighbors a piece it needs , it resets @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "this backoff reduces the load on the tracker but does not prevent an implosion of requests at the tracker in case of very large torrents .",
    "this issue , known as the _ feedback implosion problem _ in the literature , can be solved using several techniques @xcite . however , a detailed description of a feedback implosion mechanism for the pm strategy is beyond the scope of this paper .    on the tracker side ,",
    "the tracker maintains for each isp a flag that indicates whether it answered a request from a peer with the pm flag within the last @xmath18 minutes , i.e. , the tracker returned to a peer of this isp a peer outside .",
    "the tracker will return at most one peer outside each isp every @xmath18 minutes in order to avoid exploiting this strategy to bypass the locality policy .",
    "the detailed evaluation of the impact of the initial values of the timers is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "the choice of the values is a tradeoff between reactivity and erroneous detection of partitions . in this study , we set @xmath16 and @xmath18 to one minute , and we show that it efficiently detects partitions without significantly increasing the inter - isp traffic .",
    "this strategy might be abused by an attacker . indeed , as the pm strategy detects partitions relying on the accuracy of the have messages sent by neighbors , an attacker might generate dummy have to prevent peers of an isp to detect a partition .",
    "however , this is not an issue in the context of our study , as we work on a controlled environment , without attackers .",
    "in addition , we do nt believe this is a major issue for the following two reasons .",
    "first , an attacker must be a neighbor of all the peers of an isp to attack it .",
    "however , with the locality policy , the attacker must be in the isp it wants to attack , otherwise it has a very low probability to become one of the isp s peers neighbor .",
    "that makes the attack hard to deploy at the scale of a torrent .",
    "second , instead of relying on the monitoring of have messages , a peer can rely on pieces it receives .",
    "for instance , a peer can combine the current pm strategy with the additional criterion that it also generates a pm request to the tracker in case it does not receive any new piece within a @xmath19 minutes interval .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this study to perform a detailed analysis of variations of the pm strategy , which has to be addressed in future work .",
    "as this strategy has no impact on our experiments when there is no partition , we present results in section  [ locality ] and  [ small ] without the pm strategy unless explicitly specified , that is when there is a partition and that the pm strategy changes the result .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the pm strategy in section  [ sec : real - world - scenarios ] .",
    "our locality policy is designed to keep traffic local to isps .",
    "however , we are not restricted to isps , and our locality policy can keep traffic local to any network region as long as the tracker is aware of the regions and has a mean to map peers to those regions . for instance , a tracker can use information offered by a dedicated infrastructure like the p4p infrastructure @xcite . in particular , when we focus on real world scenarios in section  [ sec : real - world - scenarios ] , we will use ases instead of isps .",
    "in this section , we describe our experimental setup , and the metrics that we consider to evaluate our experiments .      in this paper , we have run large scale experiments to evaluate the impact of our locality policy on inter - isp traffic and download completion time .",
    "we have run experiments instead of simulations for two main reasons .",
    "first , it is hard to run realistic ( packet level discrete ) 2p simulations with more than a few thousand of peers due to the large state generated by each peer and the packets in transit on the links .",
    "moreover , at that scale , simulations are often slower than real time .",
    "second , the dynamics of is subtle and not yet deeply understood .",
    "running simulations with a simplified version of may hide fundamental properties of the system .",
    "as we will see during the presentation of our results , we observe behaviors that can only be pointed out using real experiments at large scale , with up to @xmath0 peers .",
    "we now describe the experimentation platform on which we run all our experiments , the bittorrent client that we use in our experiments , and how we simulate an inter - isp topology on top of the platform .",
    "we obtain all our results by running large scale experiments with a real bittorrent client .",
    "we run all our experiments on a dedicated experimentation platform .",
    "a typical node in this platform has bi or quad - core amd opteron cpu , @xmath20 to @xmath21 gb of memory , and a gigabit ethernet connectivity .",
    "the platform we used consists of @xmath22 nodes .",
    "once a set of nodes is reserved , no other experiment can run on parallel on those nodes .",
    "in particular , there is no virtualization on those nodes .",
    "therefore , experiments are totally controlled and reproducible .",
    "the bittorrent client used for our experiments is an instrumented version of the mainline client @xcite , which is based on version @xmath23 of the official client @xcite .",
    "this instrumented client can log specific messages received and sent . unless specified otherwise , we use the default parameters of this client .",
    "in particular , each peer uploads at @xmath24kb / s to @xmath21 other peers , and the maximum peer set size is @xmath25 .",
    "we will vary the upload capacity when studying the impact of heterogeneous upload capacities in section  [ locality ] ( see section  [ sec : exper - param - locality ] for a description of our heterogeneous scenario ) .",
    "we also use the choke algorithm in seed state of the official client in its version @xmath23 .",
    "this algorithm is somewhat different , as it is fairer and more robust than the one implemented in most bittorrent clients today .",
    "however , as it only impacts the seed , we do not believe this algorithm to have a significant impact on our results .",
    "our client does not implement a gossiping strategy to discover peers , like peer exchange ( pex ) used in the vuze client . whereas it is possible to make pex locality aware",
    ", it is beyond the scope of this study to make a detailed discussion of this issue .",
    "we use the following default parameters for our experiments , unless otherwise specified .",
    "peers share a content of @xmath26 mb that is split into pieces of @xmath27 kb . by default ,",
    "all peers including the initial seed start within the first @xmath28 seconds of the experiments .",
    "however , we will also vary this parameter in section  [ sec : evaluation - churn - real ] when studying the impact of churn ( see section  [ sec : evaluation - churn - real ] for a description of our scenario with churn ) .",
    "once a leecher has completed its download , it stays @xmath19 minutes as seed and then leaves the torrent .",
    "we have chosen @xmath19 minutes in order to give enough time for peers to upload the last pieces they have download before becoming a seed . however",
    ", it should not impact our results because @xmath19 minutes is small compared to the optimal download completion time ( @xmath29 minutes ) .",
    "the initial seed stays connected for the entire duration of the experiment .",
    "we run all our experiments with up to @xmath26 bittorrent clients per physical node .",
    "therefore , for torrents with @xmath26 , @xmath30 , and @xmath0 peers , we use respectively @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath26 nodes for the leechers , plus one node for the seed and the tracker . each client on a same node uses a different port to allow communication among those clients .",
    "we have performed a benchmarking test to find how many clients we can run on a single node without a performance penalty that we identify with a decrease in the client download time for a reference content of @xmath26 mb .",
    "we have found that we can run up to @xmath33 clients uploading at @xmath24kb / s on a single node without performance penalty . to be safe ,",
    "we run no more than @xmath26 clients uploading at @xmath24kb / s on one node , or @xmath20mb / s of bittorrent workload .",
    "when we will vary the upload capacity of clients in section  [ locality ] , we will then adapt the number of clients per node so that the aggregated upload capacity per node is never beyond @xmath20mb / s .",
    "we remind that our goal is to evaluate the impact of the number of inter - isp connections on inter - isp traffic and peers performance . therefore , we simulated an inter - isp topology on top of the experimentation platform we use to run our experiments .",
    "we explain , in the following , how we simulated this topology and how representative it is of the real internet .    for all our experiments",
    ", we assume that we have a set of stub - isps that can communicate among each other . on top of this topology , we consider two scenarios .",
    "the first scenario is when all stub - isps have a single _ peering _ link to each other , thus the topology of the network is a full mesh .",
    "we refer to a peering link as a link for which an isp does not pay for traffic .",
    "however , the peering technology is expensive to upgrade so isps are interested in reducing the load on those links . the second scenario is when each stub - isp is connected with a _ transit _ link to a _",
    "single _ transit - isp .",
    "all peers are in stub - isps .",
    "therefore , there is no traffic with a source or a destination in the transit - isp .",
    "we refer to a transit link as a link on which traffic is billed according to the @xmath34-th percentile",
    ". therefore , isps are interested in reducing the bursts of traffic on those links .",
    "we observe that both scenarios are simply a different interpretation of a same experiment , as all peers are in stub - isps and the traffic flows from one stub - isp to another one . in the following",
    ", we refer to _ inter - isp link _ when our discussion applies to both peering and transit links .    in our experiments ,",
    "the notion of isps and inter - isp links is virtual , as we run all our experiments on an experimentation platform . to simulate the presence of a peer in a given isp , before each experiment",
    ", we create a static mapping between peers and isps .",
    "we use this mapping to compute offline the traffic that is uploaded on each inter - isp link of the stub - isps .",
    "for instance , imagine that peer @xmath35 is mapped to the isp @xmath36 and peer @xmath37 is mapped to the isp @xmath38 .",
    "all the traffic sent from @xmath35 to @xmath37 is considered as traffic uploaded by the isp @xmath36 to the isp @xmath38 with a peering link in the first scenario or with a transit link via the transit isp in the second scenario .",
    "our experiments are equivalent to what we would have obtained in the internet with real isps and inter - isp links except for latency .",
    "we argue that latency would not significantly change our results because : i ) we limit the upload capacity on each client , thus the rtt is not the limiting factor for the end - to - end throughput ; ii ) the choking algorithm is insensitive to latency by design , as computes the throughput of neighbors ( used to unchoke them ) over a @xmath32 seconds interval , which should alleviate the impact on of the tcp ramp up  @xcite due to latency .",
    "we experiment with and without bottlenecks in the network . by default",
    ", there is no bottleneck in the network because the aggregated traffic generated by our experiments is always significantly lower than the bottleneck capacity of the experimentation platform .",
    "however , we also create artificial bottlenecks on inter - isp links to evaluate their impact on inter - isp traffic and performances ( see section  [ bottleneck ] for the description of how we limit the inter - isp link capacity ) .",
    "it is important to experiment the impact of bottlenecks on inter - isp links because the choking algorithm selects peers according to their throughput .",
    "therefore , bottlenecks may significantly change bittorrent s behavior .    finally , we have not considered a hierarchy of transit - isps .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : estim - local - benef - real ] that there is a huge amount of inter - isp traffic generated by .",
    "even if the proposed locality policy already significantly reduces this traffic , optimizations for the transit - isps still makes sense .",
    "we keep the detailed evaluation of the optimization of the traffic in a hierarchy of transit isps for future work .",
    "to evaluate our experiments , we consider three metrics : the content replication overhead , the @xmath34th percentile , and the peer slowdown .    *",
    "overhead * : :    for each stub - isp , we monitor the number of pieces that are uploaded    from this stub - isp to any other stub - isp during the experiment .",
    "then ,    to obtain the per - isp content replication overhead , we normalize the    amount of data uploaded by the size of the content for the experiment .",
    "thus , we obtain the overhead in unit of contents that crosses an    inter - isp link .",
    "we call this metric the content replication overhead ,    or overhead for short , because with the client - server paradigm , isps    with clients only would not upload any byte .",
    "we use the overhead as a    measure of load on peering links . *",
    "95th percentile * : :    to obtain the @xmath34th percentile of the overhead , we    compute the overhead by periods of @xmath19 minutes and then    consider the @xmath19 minutes overhead corresponding to the    @xmath34th percentile .",
    "the @xmath34th percentile is    the most popular charging model used on the internet @xcite . *",
    "slowdown * : :    we define the ideal completion time of a peer as the time for this    peer to download the content at a speed equivalent to the average of    the maximum upload capacity of all peers .",
    "this is the best completion    time , averaged over all peers , that can be achieved in a 2p system in    which each peer always uploads at its maximum upload capacity .",
    "the    slowdown is the experimental peer download completion time normalized    by the ideal completion time .",
    "for instance , imagine that all peers    have the same maximum upload capacity of @xmath24kb / s .",
    "an    average peer slowdown of @xmath31 for @xmath0    peers means that there is an optimal utilization of the peers upload    capacity , or that the peers are , on average , as fast as a    client - server scenario in which we have @xmath0 servers ,    one server per client sending at @xmath24kb / s .",
    "the goal of this section is to explore the relation between the number of inter - isp connections and the overhead and slowdown . in particular",
    ", we will evaluate how far we can push locality ( that is , how much we can reduce the number of inter - isp connections ) to obtain the smallest overhead attainable and what is the impact of this reduction on the slowdown .      for this series of experiments",
    ", we set the torrent size to @xmath30 peers , the number of isps to @xmath32 , and the content size to @xmath26 mb .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath26 peers per isp in all the experiments of the first series .",
    "to analyze the impact of the number of inter - isp connections on , we then vary the number of outgoing inter - isp connections between @xmath21 and @xmath39 by step of @xmath21 , and between @xmath40 and @xmath41 by steps of @xmath40 . as we consider , in this section , scenarios with the same number of peers for each isp , the total number of inter - isp connections per isp will be on average twice the number of outgoing inter - isp connections .",
    "we run experiments for each of the three following scenarios .    *",
    "homogeneous scenario with a slow seed * : :    in this scenario both the initial seed and the leechers can upload at    a maximum rate of @xmath24kb / s .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier ,    we run @xmath26 leechers per node , and we run the initial    seed and the tracker on an additional node . according to the    definition of locality policy from section  [ sec : defin - local - policy ] ,    each peer has the same probability to have a connection to the initial    seed , whichever isp it belongs to .",
    "for instance , as the initial seed    has a peer set of @xmath25 , with @xmath32 isps , each    isp has in average @xmath42 peers with a connection to this    initial seed . *",
    "heterogeneous scenario * : :    we experiment with leechers with heterogeneous upload capacities and a    fast initial seed . in each isp , one third of the peers uploads at    @xmath24kb / s , one third uploads at @xmath43kb / s , and    one third uploads at @xmath26kb / s",
    ". for simplicity , we run all    the leechers with the same upload capacity on the same node . because    we have determined that the hard drives can not sustain a workload    higher than @xmath20mb / s , we run only @xmath24 clients    per node . for bittorrent to perform optimally , the initial seed    uploads at @xmath26kb / s , as fast as the fastest leechers .",
    "each peer has the same probability to have a connection to the initial    seed , whichever isp it belongs to .",
    "+    we experiment with heterogeneous upload capacities for three reasons .",
    "the first reason is that non - local peers may be faster than local ones    so the local peers may unchoke inter - isp connections more often than    intra - isp connections , thus making the reduction of the number of    inter - isp connections inefficient to reduce inter - isp traffic .",
    "the    second reason is that local peers may be faster than non - local ones so    inter - isp connections may be rarely used to download new pieces , thus    degrading performances .",
    "the third reason is that in case of    heterogeneous upload capacities inside an isp , if fast peers are those    with the inter - isp connections , slower peers may not be given pieces    to trade among themselves , also degrading performances . *",
    "homogeneous scenario with a fast seed * : :    we experiment with leechers that upload at @xmath24kb / s and an    initial seed that uploads at @xmath26kb / s .",
    "we run this    additional experiment in order to understand whether the results    obtained with the heterogeneous scenario are due to the fast initial    seed or due to the heterogeneous capacities of leechers .",
    "first , we evaluate the impact of the number of inter - isp connections on overhead and @xmath34th percentile .",
    "then , we evaluate the impact of the number of inter - isp connections on slowdown .          we observe in fig .  [ overhead - locality ] that for the two scenarios with a well provisioned initial seed , i.e. , the homogeneous fast seed and the heterogeneous scenarios , the overhead increases linearly with the number of outgoing inter - isp connections .",
    "indeed , when there is no congestion in the network and a uniform repartition of the upload capacity of peers in each isp , the probability to unchoke a peer outside his own isp is linearly dependent on the number neighbors this peer has outside his own isp , thus it is linearly dependent on the number of outgoing inter - isp connections .",
    "we evaluate the impact of network bottlenecks in section  [ bottleneck ] .    the bittorrent arrows in fig .",
    "[ overhead - locality ] and  [ slowdown - locality ] represent the value of respectively overhead and slowdown achieved by bittorrent in the same scenario .",
    "indeed , with @xmath30 peers and @xmath32 isps of @xmath26 peers , each peer has @xmath44 of connections inside his own isp with the policy .",
    "therefore , with each isp will have @xmath45 inter - isp connections , @xmath46 of those connections being outgoing .",
    "thus corresponds to the case with @xmath46 outgoing inter - isp connections in our experiments .",
    "for all three scenarios , our locality policy enables to reduce by up to two orders of magnitude the traffic on inter - isp links .",
    "indeed , we see in fig .",
    "[ overhead - locality ] that for @xmath46 outgoing inter - isp connections , the case of the policy , the overhead is close to @xmath47 , and for @xmath21 outgoing inter - isp connections the overhead is close to @xmath31 for all three scenarios .",
    "surprisingly , we observe in fig .",
    "[ overhead - locality ] that between @xmath40 and @xmath48 outgoing inter - isp connections , there is a higher overhead for the homogeneous scenario with a slow seed than for the two other scenarios with a fast seed . indeed , as there is a lower piece diversity with a slow seed , peers in a given isp will have to use more their inter - isp connections , thus a higher overhead , in order to download pieces that are missing in their own isp .",
    "we do not observe the same issue with a fast seed because this fast initial seed is fast enough to guarantee a high piece diversity even for a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections .",
    "we also observe a linear relation between the number of outgoing inter - isp connections and the @xmath34th percentile as well as a significant reduction of the @xmath34th percentile for a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections in fig .",
    "[ peak - locality ] .",
    "however , we observe that the @xmath34th percentile for the heterogeneous scenario is much larger than for the two other scenarios .",
    "this is because in the heterogeneous scenario there are two third of the peers that are faster than @xmath24 kb / s , which is the upload capacity of all the peers for the two other scenarios .",
    "therefore , we see that even if the total amount of traffic crossing inter - isp links is not significantly impacted by the distribution of the upload capacity of peers ( see fig .",
    "[ overhead - locality ] ) , this distribution might have a major impact on the @xmath34th percentile that is used for charging traffic on transit links .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections leads to a major reduction of the overhead and @xmath34th percentile up to two order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 outgoing inter - isp connections give the minimum attainable overhead of @xmath31 . in the next section ,",
    "we explore what is the impact of such a high reduction on the peers slowdown .          the most striking result we observe in fig .",
    "[ slowdown - locality ] is that , whereas for @xmath21 outgoing inter - isp connections the overhead is optimal ( only one copy of content uploaded per isp ) and reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to the policy , the slowdown remains surprisingly low .    indeed ,",
    "[ slowdown - locality ] shows that the number of outgoing inter - isp connections has no significant impact on peers slowdown for the two scenarios with a fast seed ( heterogeneous and homogeneous with a fast seed ) and a negligible impact for more than @xmath49 outgoing inter - isp connections for the homogeneous scenario with a slow seed .",
    "this result is remarkable when one considers the huge saving a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections enables for the overhead and @xmath34th percentile .    for the homogeneous scenario with a slow seed , the slowdown increases by at most @xmath50 for @xmath21 outgoing inter - isp connections compared to the case with the policy",
    "this increase is due to a poor piece diversity , which can be avoided by having a fast initial seed as shown by the two scenarios with a fast seed in fig .",
    "[ slowdown - locality ] .",
    "moreover , even if a @xmath50 increase is not negligible , it has to be considered as the worst case .",
    "indeed , as we will show in section  [ bottleneck ] , in case of congestion on inter - isp links , the slowdown may even improve with a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections compared to the policy , because that will foster peers to exchange with peers in the same isp , thus avoiding congested paths .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that the peer slowdown remains surprisingly low even for a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections dramatically reduces the overhead and @xmath51 percentile , and that the slowdown remains low in most cases .    whereas this result is encouraging",
    ", one may wonder if it is possible to keep a low overhead and slowdown for a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections in more complex scenarios .",
    "therefore , we focus in the following on @xmath21 outgoing inter - isp connections , which leads to the lowest attainable overhead in our experiments in section  [ sec : locality - impact - overhead ] , and we evaluate the overhead and slowdown when we vary the characteristics of the torrent ( torrent size and number of peers per isp ) , or the characteristics of the network ( limitation of the capacity of the inter - isp links ) .    also , as we did not observe a significant impact of the heterogeneous upload capacity of the peers on our results in section  [ locality ] , we consider for the remaining of this paper the homogeneous scenario with a slow seed .",

    "we vary only one parameter at a time per experiment .",
    "we consider , in this section , scenarios with the same number of peers per isp .",
    "therefore , on average , the number of incoming inter - isp connections will be equal to the number of outgoing inter - isp connections .    in the following , we do not present results for the @xmath34th percentile , as they do not show any significant new insights compared to the results for the overhead .      in this section ,",
    "we make experiments with torrents with @xmath26 , @xmath30 , and @xmath0 peers , and @xmath32 isps .        in fig .",
    "[ overhead - slow - size ] upper plot , we see that for a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections the overhead is close to one independently of the torrent size , whereas for the policy it increases linearly with the torrent size .    for the torrent with @xmath26 peers ,",

    "this scenario is interesting because a locality policy only makes sense when there are enough peers inside each isp to be able to keep traffic local .",

    "we also observe on fig .",
    "[ overhead - slow - nr - peers ] lower plot that the slowdown is close to the one of for @xmath32 and @xmath56 peers per isp and around @xmath55 higher than the one of for @xmath26 and @xmath30 peers per isp .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is explained by the tradeoff that involves two main factors impacting the performance of in this scenario . on the one hand ,",
    "as the initial seed has a maximum of @xmath25 connections to other peers , at most @xmath25 isps can have a direct connection to the initial seed .",
    "all isps without direct connection to the initial seed have to get all the pieces of the content from other isps .",
    "therefore , there is a higher utilization of the inter - isp connections and a higher slowdown because the few inter - isp connections available to guarantee a high piece diversity represent a bottleneck . on the other hand ,",
    "when the number of peers per isp decreases , the number of isps increases because the torrent size is constant , thus the global number of inter - isp connections increases .",

    "we deploy our own image of gnu / linux , on which we have superuser privileges , on all the nodes we want to limit the upload capacity . limiting the upload capacity on each node allows us to reproduce internet s bottlenecks in a controlled environment .",

    "for the policy , the overhead increases with the inter - isp link capacity .",
    "the reason is that bittorrent , due to the choke algorithm , will prefer to exchange data with local peers when there is congestion on the inter - isp links , because those local peers are not on a congested path , thus a larger download speed . for high inter - isp link capacity ,",

    "but , most surprisingly , the slowdown remains close to the one of the policy in most cases . in some scenarios",
    ", the overhead can be around @xmath55 larger than with the policy . whereas an increase by @xmath55 can not be considered negligible ,",
    "this is a very positive result for two main reasons .",
    "first , we remind that our main goal in this section was to minimize the overhead .",
    "we achieved up to three orders of magnitude reduction in the overhead compared to the policy ( see fig .",
    "[ overhead - slow - size ] for a torrent with @xmath0 peers ) .",
    "there is a price to pay for such a huge reduction , which is an increase by at most @xmath55 in the slowdown .",
    "we deem this increase to be reasonable considering the savings it enables .",
    "however , we have also run experiments with @xmath39 outgoing inter - isp connections that are not shown here due do space limitations , but that are available in a technical report @xcite .",
    "we found that with @xmath39 outgoing inter - isp connections , the slowdown is always close to the one of at the price of a small increase in the overhead that is close to @xmath32 in most of the cases .",
    "however , even with this increase in the overhead , the savings compared to the policy are still huge , up to two orders of magnitude in our experiments .",
    "second , the increase we report on the slowdown is the worst one that can be achieved .",
    "indeed , all our experiments ( except the ones presented in section  [ bottleneck ] ) are performed without congestion in the network .",
    "however , we have shown in section  [ bottleneck ] that in case of congestion , our locality policy can reduce the slowdown compared to the policy .",
    "therefore , on a real network , the slowdown with our locality policy is likely to be equivalent or even better than the one of the policy .",
    "up to now , we have defined scenarios intended to understand the evolution of the overhead and slowdown with a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections when one varies one parameter at a time .",
    "those scenarios are not intended to be realistic , but to shed light on some specific properties achieved with a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections .    in this last series of experiments , we use real world data to build realistic scenarios . in particular",
    ", we will experiment with measured distribution of the number of peers per as for real torrents . in the remaining of this section ,",
    "we focus on inter - ases rather than on inter - isps traffic for two reasons .",
    "first , the information to perform the mapping between ip addresses and ases is publicly available , whereas there is no standard way to map ip addresses or ases to isps .",
    "second , isps may consist of several ases .",
    "there is no way to find where an isp wants to keep traffic local .",
    "indeed , this is most of the time an administrative decision that depends on peering and transit relations among its own ases and the rest of the internet .",
    "however , making the assumption , as we do , that isps want to keep traffic local to ases is reasonable , even if there are some cases in which isps want to define locality at a smaller or larger scale than the as level .",
    "therefore , we believe that our assumption is enough to give a coarse approximation of the potential benefits of a small number of outgoing inter - as connections at the scale of the internet .    in the following , we present the crawler we designed to get real world data",
    ". then we present the results of experiments with real torrent characteristics .",
    "finally , we give a estimation of the savings that would have been achieved using our locality policy on all the torrents we crawled .      in order to get real world data , on the @xmath60 of december 2008",
    ", we have collected @xmath61 torrent files on _ www.mininova.com _ that is considered one of the largest index of torrent files in the internet .",
    "all those torrent files were collected during a period of six hours . out of these @xmath61 torrent files , we have removed duplicate ones ( around @xmath62 of the files ) and all files for torrents that do not have at least @xmath31 seed and @xmath31 leecher .",
    "our final set of torrent files consists of @xmath1 files .",
    "we have implemented an efficient crawler that takes as input our set of torrent files and that gives as output the list of the peers in each of the torrents represented by those files .",
    "we identify a peer by the couple _",
    "( ip , port ) _ where _ ip _ is the ip address of the peer and _ port _ is the port number on which the client of this peer is listening .",
    "our crawler , which consists of two main tasks , runs on a single server ( intel core2 cpu , 4 gb of ram ) .",
    "the first task takes each torrent file sequentially .",
    "it connects first to the tracker requesting @xmath30 peers in order to receive the largest number of peers the tracker can return .",
    "indeed , the tracker returns a number of peers that is the minimum between the number of peers requested and a predefined number .",
    "the tracker returns a list of @xmath63 peers , @xmath63 usually ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath57 .",
    "the tracker also returns the current number of peers in the torrent .",
    "then , the task computes how many independent requests @xmath64 must be performed in order to retrieve at least @xmath65 of the peers in the torrent when each request results is @xmath63 peers retrieved at random from the tracker .",
    "the second task starts a round of @xmath64 parallel instances of a dummy client , each client started on a different port number , whose only one goal is to get a list of peers from the tracker .",
    "once a round is completed , the task removes all duplicates _ ( ip , port ) _ , makes sure that indeed @xmath65 of the peers of the torrent were retrieved , and saves the list of couples _ ( ip , port)_. in case , less than @xmath65 of the peers were discovered during the first round , an additional round is performed",
    ". the second task can start many parallel instances of the dummy client for different torrents at the same time .",
    "as the task of the dummy client is simple , we can run several thousands of those clients at the same time on a single machine .    at the end of this second task we crawled @xmath1 torrents within 12 hours",
    ", the largest torrents being crawled in just a few seconds , and we identified @xmath2 unique peers .    finally , we map each of the unique collected peers to the as it belongs to using bgp information collected by the routeviews project @xcite .",
    "we found that the unique peers are spread among @xmath3 ases .",
    "even if this way to perform the mapping may suffer from inaccuracy @xcite @xcite , it is appropriate for our purpose .",
    "indeed , we do not need to discover as relationship or routing information , we just need to find to which as each peer belongs to .",
    "even if some mappings are inaccurate , they will not significantly impact our results , as we consider the global distribution of peers among all ases .",
    "this simple but highly efficient crawler enables to capture a representative snapshot , at the scale of the internet , of the peers using to share contents the day of our crawl .",
    "there are , however , two limitations to our crawler .",
    "first , we only crawled torrents collected on mininova .",
    "even if mininova is one of the largest repository for torrent files , it contains few asian torrents .",
    "therefore , that means that our results present a lower bound of the benefit that can be achieved with high locality . indeed , asian torrents are usually large and , due to the geographical locality inherent to such torrents , spread among fewer ases than an average torrent .",
    "therefore , asian torrents have a larger potential for locality than other torrents .",
    "second , we are aware that a fraction of the peers advertised by trackers are fake peers . indeed , copyright holders ( or representative ) join torrents to monitor peers in order to issue dmca takedown notices to downloaders @xcite .",
    "also tracker operators may add fake peers in order pollute the information gathered by copyright holders .",
    "finally , some peers are identified as deviant , which means that they do not look like regular peers @xcite . however , even if the amount of fake peers accounts for a few percents of the overall peers , considering the large amount of torrents and peers crawled , we do not believe those fake peers to significantly bias our results .      in section  [ small ] , we performed experiments with an homogeneous number of peers per as .",
    "however , real torrents have an heterogeneous number of peers per as , which may adversely impact the overhead reduction we observed with a small number of outgoing inter - isp connections .    in order to evaluate the impact of a real distribution of peers per as on our experiments",
    ", we selected three different torrents from our crawl with different characteristics .",
    "we call those three torrents the _ reference torrents_. the first torrent , that we call _ torrent 1 _ , is a torrent for a popular movie in english language .",
    "this torrent represents the case of torrents with a worldwide interest .",
    "it has @xmath66 peers spread among @xmath67 ases , the largest as consisting of @xmath68 peers .",
    "the second torrent , called _ torrent 2 _ , is a torrent for a movie in italian language .",
    "this torrent has @xmath69 peers spread among @xmath70 ases , the largest as consisting of @xmath71 peers .",
    "this torrent is typical of torrent with local interest . in particular",
    ", this torrent spans less ases than _ torrent 1 _ , and the largest as , belonging to the largest italian isp , represents more than half of the peers of the torrent .",

    "it has @xmath72 peers spread among @xmath73 ases , the largest as consisting of @xmath74 peers .",
    "this torrent is used to evaluate middle sized torrents with few potential savings with a locality policy , as there are few peers per as .",
    "we have run experiments with the same parameters as the ones of the homogeneous scenario described in section  [ sec : exper - param - locality ] .",
    "in particular , we have the initial seed and all leechers that upload at a maximum rate of 20kb / s , and a content of @xmath26 mb .",
    "however , we consider scenarios with the same number of ases and peers per as as the three real torrents considered . in the following , we focus on experiments performed with the characteristics of _ torrent 1 _ , as the experiments with the characteristics of the two other torrents lead to the same conclusions .",
    "[ sig_noverhead ] shows the overhead per as , ordered by number of peers , for _ torrent 1_. as expected , the overhead increases linearly with the number of peers per as for the policy ( squares ) .",
    "we observe that the overhead for the scenario with @xmath21 outgoing inter - as connections is one order of magnitude lower than the one of for the largest ases .",
    "however , the overhead is still large for the largest ases .",
    "in fact , due to the heterogeneity in the number of peers per as , as explained in section  [ sec : round - robin - strategy ] , the largest as will have more incoming inter - as connections than small ones .",
    "therefore , large ases will have a larger number of inter - as connections , thus a larger overhead than small ases .",
    "the solution to this problem is to use the round robin ( rr ) strategy introduced in section  [ sec : round - robin - strategy ] .",

    "therefore , for the largest ases , only few peers will have an inter - as connection .",
    "once those peers leave the torrent after their completion , the largest as will become partitioned with a large number of peers waiting for new pieces from the initial seed . thus , a larger slowdown .    to solve this issue , we made experiments with the partition merging ( pm ) strategy that is supposed to repair partitions quickly ( see section  [ sec : part - merg - strat ] ) .",
    "indeed , we see in fig .",
    "[ sig_nslowdown ] that the scenario with @xmath21 inter - as outgoing connections and the pm+rr strategies ( plus ) gives the best slowdown over all the scenario using a locality policy , close to the one of the policy .",

    "therefore , as most connections among peers will be inter - as , the locality policy will not significantly constrain the peers connectivity graph . consequently , this graph will be random , unlike with a large torrent whose graph is clustered per as , thus a better robustness to as isolation in case of churn .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_churnreference ] left plot that the maximum overhead is reduced by one order of magnitude with @xmath21 outgoing inter - as connections compared to the policy .",
    "moreover , this reduction has no negative impact on the slowdown as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_churnreference ] right plot .    in summary ,",
    "even with churn the overhead is reduced and the slowdown remains low independently of the churn period with @xmath21 outgoing inter - as connections .",
    "we also run experiments with a churn of @xmath76 seconds , with @xmath32 to @xmath30 homogeneous ases , and other arrival patterns @xcite without any significant impact on our conclusions .      in this section , we want to estimate the benefits our locality policy would have had on the torrents we crawled . in our crawl , @xmath77 torrents and @xmath78 ases can not benefit from a locality policy , because there is at most one peer per as per torrent .",
    "however , we want to show that despite most of the torrents and ases can not benefit from a locality policy , the implementation of a locality policy at the scale of the internet would be highly beneficial .    in order to make the estimation of the benefits of our locality policy , we make several assumptions .",
    "first , we estimate the inter - as traffic in all the torrents we crawled by assuming that all the peers we found start downloading the content at the same time and stay connected to the torrent for the entire duration of their download .",
    "indeed , we have not captured temporal information , which means that we do not know how long each peer stayed in each torrent . however , it is hard to know if we underestimate or overestimate the potential for locality of those peers .",
    "indeed , for torrents in a flash crowd phase , most peers are leechers and the population increases with time .",
    "for those torrents , we are likely to underestimate the benefits of our locality policy . for torrents in an end phase ,",
    "most peers are seeds and the population is decreasing , therefore , it is likely that we overestimate the benefits of our locality policy .",
    "we believe our assumption to be reasonable and to provide , on average , at least a coarse estimation of the inter - as traffic generated by all the peers we crawled .",
    "second , we assume that peers have the same probability to exchange data with any peer in its peer set . therefore , we assume that peers have the same upload capacity and that there is no network bottleneck that bias the peer selection with the choke algorithm . here again , it is hard to assess the exact impact of this assumption on the accuracy of our results , but we believe that , considering the large number of torrents we crawled , our estimation of the inter - as traffic is reasonable .        in order to estimate the benefits of our locality policy , we first estimate the inter - as traffic generated with the policy , then we estimate the overhead savings enabled by our locality policy .    to estimate the inter - as traffic generated by the torrents we assume that the probability that a peer in a given as will upload data to a peer in another as is only a function of the number of inter - as connections of the ases . in particular , for a torrent of size @xmath79 ,",
    "an as @xmath36 of size @xmath80 , and a content of size @xmath81 , the inter - as traffic uploaded from @xmath36 is @xmath82 . while this model is simple , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_savings ] upper plot that it matches well the inter - as traffic uploaded from each as that we measured for the three reference torrents .",
    "then , for each as and each torrent , we compute using the simple model the inter - as traffic .",
    "to estimate the inter - as traffic generated by the torrents we crawled with the locality policy with pm+rr , we use the overhead savings we obtained with experiments with the three reference torrents . indeed , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : sig_savings ] lower plot , that the overhead savings of our locality policy with pm+rr compared to the policy depends on the number of peers per as , but not on the torrent size .",
    "therefore , we use the average overhead savings computed on the three reference torrents for each as size to compute the reduction of inter - as traffic .",
    "we also made the same experiments without the pm+rr strategy to estimate the inter - as traffic with our locality policy without those strategies , and we observed that the savings depend on the number of peers per as , as well .",
    "[ fig : sig_savings ] lower plot shows that even with a small number of peers per as , the overhead savings are already high .",
    "for instance , with @xmath19 peers per as , the overhead with our locality policy is @xmath5 lower than the one with the policy .",
    "[ sec : proj - local - benef ]        now , we focus on the impact of those savings at the scale of all the torrents we crawled .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_traffic ] upper plot the cumulative inter - as traffic for each torrent we crawled . the @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath0 ) largest torrents generate @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) of the inter - as traffic .",
    "the ideal policy corresponds to the inter - as traffic generated when only one copy of the content is uploaded per as and per torrent .",
    "we see that the cumulative inter - as traffic with the policy is @xmath4 petabytes , and that with @xmath21 outgoing inter - as connections it is @xmath85 petabytes ( and @xmath86 petabytes with the pm+rr strategies ) , which is only @xmath87 larger ( @xmath88 with pm+rr ) than what the ideal policy achieves .",
    "therefore , our locality policy enables a significant reduction of the inter - as traffic at the scale of the internet .",
    "the @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath89 ) largest ases represent @xmath90 ( resp .",
    "@xmath91 ) of the total inter - as traffic .",
    "interestingly , we see in fig .  [ fig : sig_traffic ] lower plot , that the ases with the largest inter - as traffic are also the ones that benefit from the most significant inter - as traffic reduction with our locality policy .",
    "we checked manually the @xmath43 largest ases to make sure that they do not belong to copyright holders ( or piracy tracking companies ) to be sure that most of the peers in those ases are real peers @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "a high locality policy can reduce by up to @xmath5 the inter - as traffic for the @xmath1 real torrents we crawled spread across @xmath3 ases .",
    "karagiannis et al .",
    "@xcite first introduced the notion of locality in the context of 2p content replication .",
    "they show monitoring the access link of an edge network and running simulations using a log collected from a tracker for a single torrent @xcite that peer - assisted locality distribution is an efficient solution for both the isps and the end - users .",
    "p4p @xcite is a project whose aim is to provide a light - weight infrastructure to allow cooperation between 2p applications and isps .",
    "xie et al .",
    "presented small scale experiments ( with between @xmath92 and @xmath93 planetlab nodes ) on two specific scenarios .",
    "they also reported on a field test experiment around @xmath7 of inter - isp traffic savings with p4p for a single isp and a single large torrent .",
    "aggarwal et al .",
    "@xcite present an architecture that is similar by some aspects to p4p .",
    "the authors define the notion of _ oracle _ that are supplied by isps in order to propose a list of neighbors to peers .",
    "they perform their evaluation on gnutella using simulations and small scale experiments with 45 gnutella nodes .",
    "another approach that requires no dedicated infrastructure is ono @xcite .",
    "ono clusters users based on the assumption that clients redirected to a same cdn server are close .",
    "the authors have developed an ono plugin for the vuze client .",
    "the authors reported measurement results collected from @xmath94 users of the ono plugin over a @xmath32 month period .",
    "they reported up to @xmath95 performance increase in average peer download completion time .",
    "however , the authors did not give an explicit inter - isp traffic reduction , but showed a reduction of the path length between peers in terms of ip and as hops .",
    "bindal et al .",
    "@xcite present the impact of a deterministic locality policy on isps peering links load and on end - users experience .",
    "the authors considered simulations on a scenario with @xmath96 isps with @xmath43 peers each , thus a torrent of @xmath97 peers .",
    "our work significantly differs from those previous ones , by being the first one to extensively evaluate the impact of key parameters like the number of inter - isp connections , the torrent size , the distribution of peers per isp , the inter - isp bottlenecks , the churn rate , and the peers upload capacity using large scale experiments and real world data .",
    "in particular , we considered @xmath1 real torrents spread across @xmath3 ases ( it was a single large torrent and a single as for the p4p field test @xcite ) and showed that using only four inter - isp connections ( it was @xmath98 of inter - isp connections for the p4p field tests ) we can reduce the inter - isp traffic at the scale of the internet by @xmath5 .",
    "our work is intended to be complimentary to previous works @xcite by answering the two fundamental questions : how far can we push locality ?",
    "what is at the scale of the internet the reduction of inter - isp traffic that can be achieve with locality ?    in this paper , we have performed an extensive evaluation of the impact of a small number of inter - isp connections on overhead and slowdown .",
    "we have run experiments with up to @xmath0 real clients in a variety of scenarios , including scenarios based on real data crawled from @xmath1 torrents representing @xmath2 unique peers spread among @xmath3 ases .",
    "our main findings are that a small number of inter - isp connections will dramatically reduce the overhead and keep the slowdown low independently of the torrent size , the number of peers per isp , the upload capacity of peers , or the churn .",
    "we have introduced two new strategies called round robin and partition merging that make the use of a small number of inter - isp connections feasible for real torrents of the internet .    however",
    ", we do not advocate for such small number of inter - isp connections in real deployments .",
    "instead , we intend to increase confidence in locality by showing that even in case of high locality still performs extremely well , and that with high locality the inter - isp traffic reduction can be up to @xmath5 on the torrents we crawled , which is @xmath6 petabytes of data .",
    "finally , we have explored , in section  [ locality ] , a scenario with three classes of upload capacity spread uniformly over all peers .",
    "we have shown that the results obtained for this scenario do not significantly differ from an homogeneous scenario . however , we did not explored scenarios with realistic peers upload capacity distribution . in fact",
    ", it is hard , if not impossible , to obtain this information at the scale of the internet .",
    "moreover , we believe that the impact of the real heterogeneity of peers will be better explored with a real deployment .",
    "our work shows that a real deployment makes sense , and we are currently working with bittorrent inc . to implement , evaluate , and possibly deploy a locality policy in the utorrent client , the most popular client with more than @xmath39 millions users .",
