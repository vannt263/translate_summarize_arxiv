    "the physics and chemistry of fullerenes is full of surprises . after almost ten years of intensive theoretical and experimental work , unexpected discoveries of ferromagnetic polymerized c@xmath8 @xcite as well as superconductivity in hole doped pristine c@xmath8 @xcite and in lattice - expanded c@xmath8 @xcite",
    "raise new questions about the electronic structure of the c@xmath8 molecule and its molecular ions . using the field - effect doping techniques",
    ", it has been shown that high transition temperatures are achieved for the case of three holes per the c@xmath8 molecule @xcite , when many electron effects come into play .",
    "motivated by these new experimental findings , here we present a calculation of the electronic structure of few holes of c@xmath2 .",
    "our second goal is to study the molecular term picture of the c@xmath5 anion ( @xmath28 ) , which behaves as a quasi - element in a vast majority of ionic compounds @xcite .",
    "when c@xmath29 units are in a solid , additional inter - molecular interactions superimposed on the intra - molecular ones should be taken into account and a realistic theory of solids should treat both kinds of interactions on equal footing .",
    "therefore , the consideration of intra- molecular correlations should be a necessary ingredient of a many electron theory aiming to describe superconductivity , magnetic properties or a metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the problem is also a challenge from experimental point of view @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will give quantitative results on the many electron terms and magnetic moments of c@xmath2 and c@xmath5 .    while the one - electronic structure of the neutral c@xmath8 molecule is known for many years @xcite ( in fact , even before the actual discovery of the buckminsterfullerene @xcite ) the case of two or three electrons ( holes ) on the degenerate @xmath13 or @xmath30 shell requires a special treatment .",
    "then the two ( @xmath31 ) or three ( @xmath32 ) electrons ( holes ) are equivalent and should be treated on equal footing .",
    "such kind of situation is very typical for atoms with open electron shells .",
    "when an atom has two or more valence electrons on orbitally degenerate states ( like @xmath33 , @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) its energy spectrum can be very complex reflecting the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "there exist empirical observations known as hund s rules , which prescribe the occupation of the orbitals , but those are just consequences of the atomic theory of many electron states formulated by condon and shortley long ago @xcite .",
    "the real driving force behind the term splitting is the coulomb repulsion of the valence electrons . while in atoms electronic energy levels are split due to the multipolar coulomb intra - atomic interactions , in the case of c@xmath8 we deal with the intra - molecular ones .    here",
    "we present an approach which was inspired by the theory of many electron atomic states @xcite .",
    "it is also an extension of our original method of multipole expansion for electronic states @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our treatment should not be confused with an ordinary single - determinant hartree - fock calculation which does not take into account the intra - molecular correlations and the molecular term structure is overlooked .",
    "we will see ( sec .",
    "iii ) that in our approach each basis function represents a slater determinant , and the solution is found as their linear combination . as such , the method corresponds to a many determinant treatment or configuration interaction ( ci ) .",
    "therefore , the approach is a genuine many electron one as long as we limit ourselves to the relevant orbital space ( @xmath30 , @xmath13 or @xmath12 ) . to our knowledge , in the literature there are only two calculations concerning the electronic structure of negatively charged c@xmath5 molecular ions , reported by negri _",
    "@xcite , and by saito _",
    "_ @xcite . in the latter work , however , the assignment of excitations with molecular terms is done only for the neutral molecule ( @xmath36 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we assume that the molecule has the icosahedral symmetry .",
    "if one wants to consider a distortion of c@xmath2 or c@xmath5 @xcite , the computed energy levels and their eigenvectors can be used as a starting point for the description of the jahn - teller effect in these systems .",
    "indeed , the electron - phonon ( or vibronic ) coupling occurs if @xmath37 ^ 2 $ ] contains @xmath38 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath39 is the symmetry of the electronic molecular term under consideration , while @xmath38 is the symmetry of a vibrational normal mode .",
    "it is evident then that for a meaningful analysis of the vibrational coupling and the resultant jahn - teller distortion , one has to know the symmetry of the corresponding electronic terms , that is the issue of the present study .",
    "in addition , now it has been realized that the jahn - teller effect for c@xmath40 is rather weak , and the situation is probably best described as dynamic @xcite , where the molecule on average retains its icosahedral symmetry .",
    "the vibronic coupling for c@xmath2 is not so well investigated , but estimated as @xmath41 ev .",
    "we will see that the energy span of the hole configurations a few times exceeds this value .",
    "therefore , if there is a static jahn - teller effect for c@xmath2 , it can be treated in the limit of weak or intermediate coupling , leading to a more complex picture where the molecular terms are subjected to further splitting @xcite .",
    "since the c@xmath8 molecule reveals nontrivial degeneracies and peculiarities , its term structure has been studied by group - theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "the analysis there was focused on the symmetry and number of terms for @xmath42 @xcite and @xmath43 @xcite configurations , but by itself it can not give a quantitative picture of the splittings . where our approach overlaps with the group - theoretical one , our findings are in agreement with the latter .",
    "the paper comprises the following sections . first ( sec .",
    "ii ) , we introduce the angular dependencies of @xmath30 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 functions .",
    "next ( sec .",
    "iii ) , we describe our method of treating multipole coulomb correlations for many electrons",
    ". then we apply it to hole- and excitonic configurations of the c@xmath8 molecule , sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v we give the resultant energy spectra and compare our calculations with those of negri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for c@xmath9 . in sec .",
    "vi we compute magnetic moments , in sec .",
    "vii optical lines and line strengths for the electron dipolar transitions of c@xmath9 and c@xmath25 . finally , we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "the neutral c@xmath8 molecule has the highest molecular point group ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "expanding its density in multipole series one finds that nontrivial angular dependencies are given by the symmetry adapted functions ( safs ) @xcite of @xmath45 symmetry with the lowest components characterized by @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite . that makes the c@xmath8 fullerene the most spherical molecule among the others . owing to such unique symmetry , the parentage of @xmath49-molecular orbitals in spherical harmonics",
    "can be clearly traced @xcite .",
    "for lowest occupied @xmath49-levels of the neutral molecule we have @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding molecular states accommodate 60 electrons and the seven electron shells are completely filled .",
    "then the generalized unsld theorem @xcite ensures that the resulting electron density of the @xmath49-states has full ( or unit ) icosahedral symmetry @xmath45 .",
    "( here and below we use capital letters for the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of density and small letters for the irreps of electron wave functions . )    due to the direct correspondence between these @xmath49-shells and the molecular orbital index @xmath58 , one can immediately find out an orbital part for a given @xmath49-state in the same way as we know the orbital parts of @xmath59 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 electrons in an atom .",
    "therefore , the type of an irreducible representation ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and the orbital index @xmath58 uniquely determine the angular dependence of the molecular orbitals .",
    "the angular functions are called spherical harmonics adapted for the icosahedral group @xmath44 .",
    "such symmetry adapted functions ( safs ) were tabulated by cohan in ref .   for all @xmath65 .",
    "( unfortunately , cohan worked with unnormalized spherical harmonics so that it requires some efforts to express safs in conventional spherical harmonics @xmath66 . ) in particular for the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) @xmath57 one has    @xmath67    here the normalized real spherical harmonics are defined with the phase convention of ref .",
    "and the orientation of the c@xmath8 molecule corresponds to the choice of the @xmath68 axis as one of 12 fivefold axes and the @xmath69 axis as one of the twofold axes perpendicular to @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "we call this position of c@xmath8 the orientation of cohan . in order to transform the molecule to the standard orientation @xcite where molecular twofold axes lie along the cartesian @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 direction one has to rotate the molecule anticlockwise about the @xmath69 axis by an angle @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath30 orbital function then is expressed in terms of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 stands for @xmath74 or @xmath75 , @xmath76 of real spherical harmonics ( appendix b ) . in the following",
    "we will work with the molecule in the orientation of cohan .",
    "( of course , the results are independent of the choice of the molecular orientation . )",
    "the lowest unoccupied molecular @xmath13 orbital ( lumo ) corresponds to @xmath77 and has the following three angular components in cohan s orientation of c@xmath8 :    @xmath78    the angular parts of @xmath13 lumo have been derived before in refs .   and .",
    "in the standard orientation of c@xmath8 they are given by table  i of ref . .",
    "the lumo - homo energy gap is about 2.7 ev @xcite .",
    "finally , at an energy about 1.15 ev @xcite above lumo one finds the molecular @xmath12 level with @xmath46 ( lumo+1 ) . in the orientation of cohan the angular parts are given by    @xmath79",
    "our method of multipole expansion of the coulomb interaction has been reported before @xcite . here",
    "we extend it and apply to the case of the c@xmath8 molecule with the icosahedral symmetry . in the following we consider in detail the case of two and three @xmath13 electrons . starting with a pair of electrons",
    "we will give a special attention to the procedure of adding one extra @xmath13 electron to the pair .",
    "in the same way one can add a fourth electron to the group of three electrons and etc .",
    "therefore , our main goal of treating @xmath80 electrons can be reached by adding one electron after another .",
    "since the estimated one - electron spin - orbit coupling is negligible ( @xmath81 @xmath82 ) @xcite , we are working in the  @xmath83 ( russell - saunders ) \" molecular approximation .",
    "( the spin - orbit coupling is a single particle operator and in principle can be included in the calculation @xcite . )",
    "we start with a pair of @xmath13 electrons and label the two - electron basis ket - vectors by a single index @xmath84 which incorporates a pair of one - electron indices @xmath85 , @xmath86 the indices @xmath87 stand for the @xmath13 orbitals ( @xmath88 ) and the spin projection quantum number .",
    "the corresponding basis wave functions are @xmath89 where @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath91 is the radial component of the @xmath13 molecular orbitals ( mo ) , @xmath92 stands for polar angles @xmath93 .",

    "the order of indices in ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) is important if we associate the first electron with the state @xmath102 while the second with the state @xmath103 . from the dynamical equivalence of the electrons we can permute the spin - orbitals of the state @xmath104 to the standard order , eq .",

    "( alternatively , one can use the standard procedure of antisymmetrization of the basis vectors ( [ 2.1 ] ) . ) thus , our basis ( [ 2.1 ] ) consists of @xmath10715 different vectors @xmath108 .    in the following",
    "we will study the intra- molecular correlations of electrons within a formalism based on a multipole expansion of the coulomb potential between two electrons ( charge @xmath109 ) , @xmath110 the multipole expansion in terms of real spherical harmonics @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( we use the phase convention and the definitions of ref .",
