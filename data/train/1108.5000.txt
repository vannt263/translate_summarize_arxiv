    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite arouse great interest in ultracold molecule due to their potential applications for the tests of fundamental physics and for the drifts of fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "this fundamental system is of special interest since the collisional coherence can led to remarkable demonstration of the reversible atom - molecule formation @xcite ; thus open the floodgate for many beautiful experiments , such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules , dissociation of molecular becs , the  clumping \" of the condensates due to the modulational instability , and so on @xcite .",
    "it also represents a rich ground for investigations of the nonlinear excitation of the coupled atomic - molecular bose - einstein condensates ( ambec ) @xcite .    in real experiments ,",
    "the cold molecules can be produced from a fermi gas of atoms @xcite or an atomic bec based on feshbach resonances , raman photoassociation , or stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "however , among them , the feshbach coupling mechanism is restricted to the creation of molecules in the highest rovibrational level and is only practicable for a limited number of systems @xcite , and the losses caused by inelastic atom - molecule collisions occurs at a significant rate . in the raman photoassociation process , the effective conversion rate of a pair of atoms to ground molecule is limited by spontaneous emission from the excited molecular state ; while the stirap is known to have the highest rate of efficiency when converting an atomic condensates into a molecular one based on a raman transition , where the input raman laser pulse couples the molecular levels and reduces spontaneous emission . during this process",
    ", the molecular state is in a dark superposition state ( or coherent population trapping state , cpt state ) , which decouples from the light and thus suppresses losses due to spontaneous light scattering @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the excited molecular state of this coupled system remains almost unpopulated .",
    "thus it is not difficult to see the existence of dark is the key ingredient in effective production of molecule through stirap technique",
    ".    generally speaking , the dark state can not exist with any external potential as the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( see eq .",
    "( [ cgp ] ) below ) is nonintegrable @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to find the exact dark state solutions of this coupled system with tunable nonlinear interactions and external potential .",
    "based on the framework of a three - component mean - field model that takes into account all types of the mean - field nonlinear atomic and molecular interactions and external potential .",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the dark states in the parametrically coupled atomic - molecular bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the results show that there are a class of external potentials , such as double - well , periodical and double periodical , and harmonic potentials , which can be used to support the existence of the dark states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly outline the theoretical model under study and the underlying mean - field coupled equations",
    ". then a class of simplification is presented and the reduced coupled equations , focusing on the cpt solutions , are obtained . in sec .",
    "iii , the analytical methods for solving the coupled schrdinger equations are introduced , and we present several classes of exact dark state solutions where different potentials can be applied to trap the coupled condensates and relationship between system parameters are established . a simple summary is given in the final section .",
    "to begin with , we consider a quasi - one - dimensional geometry of the condensates where the transverse traps are tight enough , thus the transverse motion of the condensates are frozen to the ground state of the transverse harmonic trapping potential .",
    "the coupled heisenberg equations of motion for the atomic and molecular components are govern by the system of equations as follows :    @xmath0    here we define the order parameter @xmath1 represents an atomic species of mass @xmath2 in a potential @xmath3 ; while @xmath4 and @xmath5 represents the ground and excited molecular species with a potential @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the nonlinear atom - atom interaction @xmath8 , the atom - molecule interaction @xmath9 , and the ground molecule - molecule interaction @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the corresponding @xmath12-wave scattering lengths modulated by a feshbach resonance .",
    "@xmath13 is the rabi frequency corresponding to the transitions between the atomic state and the excited molecular state , and @xmath14 is the one between the molecular ground and excited states . finally , in this paper , we will only focus on the degenerate case with @xmath15 and ignore loss and growth mechanisms @xcite ; thus the total number of atomic particles , including pairs of atoms inside the diatomic molecules is conserved in this model .    from a general mathematical and nonlinear physical point of view , eq .",
    "( [ cgp ] ) is an example of a classically nonintegrable field theory , which needs to be treated numerically . to obtain the exact dark state solutions",
    ", we make a class of simplifications . to this end",
    ", we first neglect the excited molecular state as it has a small population compared with atomic and ground molecular states , and then set @xmath16 .",
    "similar to homogeneous condensates cases , the stirap model considered in this paper is also found to support a cpt state ( with @xmath17 ) in the form of    @xmath18    normalizing the time and length in eq .",
