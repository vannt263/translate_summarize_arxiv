    "energy harvesting ( eh ) is considered a revolutionary technology for energy - constrained wireless networks , such as sensor and ad - hoc , due to its capability to provide everlasting power supply [ [ lit1]]-[[lit2 ] ] .",
    "performance of these systems is maximized by adapting the output powers of the eh transmitters given the energy causality constraint [ [ lit3]]-[[lit4 ] ] .",
    "however , eh from the environment ( e.g. , solar or wind ) is an intermittent and uncontrollable process . in order to maintain reliable eh - based communication , dedicated far - field radio frequency ( rf ) radiation",
    "is used as energy supply for eh transmitters , which is known as wireless power transfer ( wpt ) [ [ lit6 ] ] .",
    "the wpt can be realized as a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer [ [ lit7 ] ] , or , alternatively , over a dedicated ( either time or frequency ) channel for energy transfer .",
    "the latter option gives rise to the so - called wireless powered communications networks ( wpcns ) , which typically transmit using the time - division multiple access ( tdma ) [ [ lit8]]-[[lit12 ] ] .",
    "an example wpcn may be a sensor network consisted of a base station ( bs ) and multiple eh sensors deployed in a hostile environment , such that they send information ( e.g. , telemetry ) over the uplink and receive energy broadcasted by the bs over the downlink .    in [ [ lit8 ] ]",
    ", the authors determine the optimal tdma scheme among the half - duplex nodes ( either bs or ehns ) , depending on the channel fading states .",
    "the optimal time - sharing in wpcns with separated frequency channels for energy broadcast and information transmissions ( it ) , were studied in [ [ lit9 ] ] .",
    "furthermore , [ [ lit10 ] ] studies the wpcn with full - duplex nodes , where the bs is equipped with two antennas .",
    "the authors in [ [ lit11 ] ] consider wpcns , where the nodes choose between two power levels , i.e. , a constant desired power , or a lower power when its eh battery has stored insufficient energy . finally , in [ [ lit12 ]",
    "] a three - node relaying system was considered , where both source and relay harvest energy from the bs , by using wpt .    the above - referenced works analyzed wpcns ( except for [ [ lit11 ] ] ) and proposed optimal ( either time or power ) allocation schemes that aim at maximizing the achievable sum information rate ( i.e. , throughput in wpcns ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider a similar wpcn model as in [ [ lit8 ] ] and propose a novel optimal scheme , which jointly allocates the bs broadcasting power and the time sharing among the wireless nodes .",
    "our proposed scheme significantly improves the overall wpcn throughput , compared to [ [ lit8 ] ] , which assumes a constant bs transmit power .",
    "for the point - to - point scenario , the proposed scheme is generalized to account for the fixed ( circuit ) power consumption by the ehns , which , to the best of authors knowledge , has not been considered in the literature so far .",
    "as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we consider a wpcn in a fading environment , consisting of a half - duplex bs and @xmath0 half - duplex ehns .",
    "the bs broadcasts rf energy to the ehns , whereas the ehns transmit information back to the bs .",
    "the ehns are equipped with rechargeable eh batteries that harvest the rf energy broadcasted from the bs .",
    "the it from ehns to bs ( it phase ) , and the wpt from bs to ehns ( eh phase ) are realized as successive signal transmissions using tdma over a common channel , where each tdma frame / epoch is of duration @xmath1 . as depicted in fig .",
    "1(b ) , each ( tdma ) epoch consists of an eh phase and an it phase , whereas the it phase itself consists of @xmath0 successive its from ehns to the bs .",
    "we assume perfect synchronization among all the nodes .",
    "the fading between the the bs and ehn @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is a stationary and ergodic random process , and follows the quasi - static block fading model , i.e. , the channel is constant in each slot but changes from one slot to the next",
    ". the duration of one fading block is assumed equal to @xmath1 , and one block coincides with a single epoch . for convenience , the downlink ( bs-@xmath4 ) and the uplink ( @xmath4-bs ) channels are assumed reciprocal , and their fading power gains in epoch @xmath5",
    "are denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "they are normalized by the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) power , yielding @xmath7 with an average value of @xmath8/n_0 $ ] , where @xmath9 $ ] denotes expectation .",
    "ehns and a common bs , ( b ) tdma epoch / frame structure , width=355 ]    [ fig1 ]",
    "let us consider @xmath10 epochs . in epoch @xmath5 ,",
    "the bs transmits with power @xmath11 .",
    "the duration of the eh phase is , @xmath12 , and the it duration of the ehn @xmath2 is @xmath13 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "note that , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are referred to as the time - sharing parameters .",
    "we propose a scheme for jointly optimal allocation of @xmath11 and @xmath17 so as to maximize the wpcn overall average throughput , subject to the average available bs transmit power , @xmath18 , and maximum bs transmit power , @xmath19 .",
    "the proposed scheme is feasible if , in each epoch @xmath5 , the bs has perfect knowledge of the instantaneous fading gains in all bs-@xmath4 channels .    during the eh phase of epoch @xmath5 , the amount of harvested power by ehn @xmath2 is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the energy harvesting efficiency of ehn @xmath2 .",
    "note , it is safe to assume that @xmath22 , because @xmath21 always appears together with @xmath23 through the product @xmath24 , which only affects the parameter @xmath25 , but the form of the end results is unaffected . during the it phase , ehn @xmath2 completely spends its harvested energy , @xmath26 , for transmitting a complex - valued gaussian codeword of duration @xmath13 , comprised of @xmath27 symbols , with an output power @xmath28 and an information rate , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an auxiliary fading coefficient @xmath31 where @xmath23 and @xmath32 denote the uplink and downlink channel gains . ] .    since @xmath33 , the average wpcn throughout is calculated as @xmath34 , and can be maximized according to the following optimization problem @xmath35 @xmath36    let us define @xmath30 and @xmath37 .",
    "the optimal bs transmit power , @xmath38 , is determined by @xmath39    the optimal duration of the eh phase , @xmath40 , is found as the root of the following transcendental equation , @xmath41 whereas the optimal it duration of ehns @xmath2 is given by @xmath42    the constant @xmath43 is found from @xmath44",
    ".    please refer to appendix a.    in practice , constant @xmath43 is estimated by an iterative algorithm , such as the bisection method [ [ lit12b ] ] .",
    "basically , the value of @xmath43 is updated following some rule ( e.g. , subinterval bisection ) until the constraint @xmath45 in ( [ rav4 ] ) is met with some predefined accuracy .",
    "in practical eh transmitters , besides their transmit power , an additional power is also consumed by its non - ideal electric circuitry ( e.g. , ac / dc converter , analog rf amplifier , and processor ) , denoted as the _ processing energy cost _ [ [ lit12a ] ] . in this section , we extend the system model with non - negligible processing cost to a point - to - point system , consisting of a bs and a single ehn ( @xmath46 ) and propose a jointly optimal power and time allocation .",
    "we consider the following practical model for the total power consumption of the ehn : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ehn s transmit power , and @xmath49 is the ehn s processing energy cost .",
    "note that the ehn can adapt its transmit power in each epoch , whereas @xmath49 has a fixed value .",
    "the amount of harvested power by the ehn is @xmath50 , which is completely spent in the successive it of duration @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the ehn s transmit power in epoch @xmath5 is given by @xmath53 and the achievable information rate in this epoch is given by @xmath54 .    given @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we aim at maximizing the average throughput , @xmath55 . in ( [ rav4 ] ) , we set @xmath46 , introduce ( [ ps ] ) , and restate the optimization problem in terms of the optimization variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 as follows : @xmath58 @xmath59 in ( [ pcprob ] ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 correspond to @xmath62 and @xmath63 in ( [ rav4 ] ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are compressed into the single constraint @xmath66 , whereas @xmath67 is a natural constraint for ehns transmit power .",
    "the optimal bs transmit power , @xmath38 , is determined by @xmath68    the optimal duration of the eh phase , @xmath40 , is given by the root of the following transcendental equation , @xmath69    the constant @xmath43 is found from @xmath44",
    ".    please refer to appendix b.    note , when setting @xmath70 , the optimal solutions ( [ pi2 ] ) and ( [ transc2 ] ) reduce to ( [ pi1 ] ) and ( [ transc ] ) , respectively , when @xmath46 .",
    "this validates our proposed optimal solutions , because ( [ transc2 ] ) and ( [ pi2 ] ) are derived based upon an alternative approach to that of the previous section , cf .",
    "( [ pcprob ] ) vs. ( [ rav4 ] ) .",
    "the respective generalization for the case @xmath71 , that involves the processing cost , yields non - convex optimization problem .",
    "we illustrate our results for eh systems with @xmath46 and @xmath72 ehns in rayleigh fading . the awgn power is set to @xmath73 w , and",
    "the deterministic path loss ( @xmath74 ) of the bs - ehn channel is @xmath75 db . thus , @xmath76 = 1/pl$ ] and @xmath77 .",
    "we consider @xmath78 epochs .",
    "2 depicts the average throughput ( in bits / symbol ) vs. @xmath18 ( in watts ) .",
    "two pairs of curves are presented for : ( 1 ) non - zero processing energy cost , @xmath79 @xmath80w ( denoted as @xmath81 ) , and ( 2 ) zero processing energy cost , @xmath70 .",
    "the `` benchmark '' curve refers to the case of a wpcn with fixed bs transmit power ( @xmath82 ) and an optimal time allocation according to [ [ lit8 ] , eq .",
    "clearly , the joint time and power allocation significantly outperforms the benchmark scheme .",
    "the optimization problem ( [ rav4 ] ) is non - convex because of the products and ratios of the optimization variables @xmath11 and @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we reformulate the problem by introducing the change of variables @xmath83 , and transform ( [ rav4 ] ) into a convex problem in terms of @xmath84 and @xmath17 , as @xmath85 @xmath86 since @xmath17 , @xmath3 , do not appear in @xmath45 and @xmath87 in ( [ rav4 ] ) , ( [ rav4alt ] ) can be split into two optimization problems : the first optimizes @xmath17 , @xmath3 , for given @xmath84 and @xmath57 as @xmath88 @xmath89 and the second optimizes @xmath84 and @xmath57 , @xmath90 given the optimized @xmath17 , @xmath3 , @xmath91 @xmath92 since ( [ part1 ] ) is convex optimization problem , its lagrangian is written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint in ( [ part1 ] ) .",
    "we now differentiate ( [ lagran ] ) with respect to @xmath17 and set the derivative to zero , i.e. , @xmath95 for each @xmath2 , @xmath3 , which yields the following set of @xmath0 equations , @xmath96 given @xmath80 , these equations can be satisfied for all @xmath2 , @xmath3 , if @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a function of @xmath80 . considering the constraint in ( [ part1 ] )",
