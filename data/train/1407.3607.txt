    "the study of the supercooled liquid and glassy states in molecular systems is , nowadays , one of the most important topics in the physics of disordered materials .",
    "though the molecular processes underlying glass formation still constitute an unsettled subject , some traces of universality in the behavior of highly viscous liquids near vitrification have been noticed . as general characteristics , on approaching the glass transition the structural ( @xmath1 ) relaxation process shows _ i _ ) a non - debye behavior of the relaxation function , and _ ii _ ) a dramatic increase of the relaxation time , @xmath2 .",
    "different physical routes can be covered to get vitrification .",
    "decreasing the temperature , @xmath3 , is the common way to form a glass .",
    "however , varying the pressure , @xmath4 , also represents an effective means .",
    "indeed , the effects on molecular motions of an isothermal compression resemble those which are caused by an isobaric cooling . for practical reasons",
    ", cooling is generally preferred , since high pressures ( of the order of mpa ) are necessary to produce dynamical changes similar to those obtained by changing the temperature within few tens of degrees .",
    "anyway , the study of the @xmath1 relaxation pressure dependence can give an insight into the nature of the liquid - glass transition .",
    "the past few years have actually seen a growing use of hydrostatic pressure in experimental investigations of glass formers ( see for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "such experiments provide a more stringent testing - ground for the numerous models proposed of the structural relaxation time evolution near vitrification . among these , two are the most widely used , which are based on the free volume and configurational entropy concepts .",
    "free volume approaches consider the decrease of unoccupied volume as the basic mechanism leading to structural arrest of a liquid system .",
    "the alternative view is that the progressive slowdown of molecular motions responsible for the glass transition is due to a reduction of the system s configurational entropy .    in this paper",
    ", we test on salol the ability of free volume and configurational entropy models to interpret the temperature and pressure dependence of the structural relaxation time .",
    "salol , is a good candidate since much of the thermodynamic data is known , allowing refinement on testing theoretical models .",
    "it has intensively been studied at ambient pressure with several spectroscopic techniques , like brillouin scattering @xcite , depolarized light scattering @xcite , impulsive stimulated light scattering @xcite , optical kerr effect spectroscopy @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite , x - ray diffraction @xcite , and dielectric spectroscopy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "few experiments have been carried out by varying both temperature and pressure , namely dielectric spectroscopy @xcite , depolarized raman scattering @xcite , and viscosity measurements @xcite .",
    "recently , some of us presented a preliminary investigation @xcite on salol performed in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 domain by using photon correlation spectroscopy . here , we extend our analysis through pressure - volume - temperature ( pvt ) data taken in both the supercooled and crystalline phases . we show how an appropriate use of the pvt results provides a realistic estimate of the configurational contribution to the excess entropy of salol .",
    "finally , we compare our @xmath5 data with the prediction of the pressure - extended cohen - grest model @xcite , derived in the frame of the free volume theory .",
    "the entropy model by adam and gibbs ( ag ) @xcite is based on the concept of configurational entropy and the assumption of cooperatively rearranging regions . starting from the observation that the sluggish relaxation behavior governing the glass transition is a manifestation of a dearth of configurations accessible to the system , the ag theory states a relationship between the structural relaxation time , @xmath2 , and the configurational entropy @xmath6 :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is nearly constant , and @xmath9 is the relaxation time at very high temperature . @xmath6 measures the entropic contribution arising from the possibility of a system to rearrange its structure in different configurations , which is typical of a liquid .",
    "theoretically , a quantitative evaluation of @xmath6 can be done in terms of the difference between the entropy of the liquid phase and the entropy of an ideal amorphous - solid phase ( ideal glass ) in which only vibrations ( harmonic and anharmonic ) and secondary relaxation processes are active @xcite .",
    "this quantity can , in principle , be determined by computer simulations , but is inaccessible to experiments in a direct manner .",
    "some efforts have been made to bypass a direct experimental determination of configurational entropy in a number of liquids .",
    "unfortunately , the procedures proposed require an independent estimate of vibrational contributions to the entropy over a broad range of temperatures @xcite or an estimate of the excess vibrational entropy at @xmath10 @xcite , all of which implying non - trivial approximations .",
    "we also remark that all the previous estimates of @xmath6 are based on temperature dependent data alone , and are not constrained by pressure dependent data .",
    "+ furthermore , much literature documented the extensive use of the experimentally accessible liquid over crystal ( or glass ) excess entropy , @xmath11 , in place of @xmath12 , showing that the ag expression works well in a number of systems with @xmath12 replaced by @xmath11 @xcite . in this context , understanding the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a challenging issue .",
    "a proportionality of these two quantities at atmospheric pressure has recently been proposed @xcite , but a verification of such hypothesis through a relaxation experiment performed as a function of temperature alone can not be conclusive , as the proportionality constant would simply renormalize the value of @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ ag ] ) .    building on this background , a method based on a pressure extended adam - gibbs ( peag ) equation has recently been proposed by some of us @xcite to analyze temperature and pressure dependent relaxation measurements .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath12 has been introduced in eq .",
