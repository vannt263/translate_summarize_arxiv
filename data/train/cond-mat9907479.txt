    "spin-1/2 ladder models can describe the magnetic behavior of a variety of quasi - one - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "examples include the cuprate materials srcu@xmath0o@xmath2  @xcite , lacuo@xmath3  @xcite and ( sr , ca)@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "spin excitations in the isolated ladders have a finite energy gap , which makes them prototype spin liquids .",
    "this is of interest in relation to high temperature superconductivity , since upon doping they become resonating - valence - bond liquids , with a spin excitation gap and a dominant quasi - long range pairing correlations  @xcite .",
    "another example of the spin-1/2 ladder systems are the layered vanadate compounds cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "although cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 have nearly identical vanadium oxygen planes however their magnetic properties are strikingly different .",
    "cav@xmath0o@xmath1 has a large spin gap of about 600  k  @xcite , while the spin gap in mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 is very small only about 20  k  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the planar cuprates , where a hole in the cu @xmath7-orbitals results in a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling for the 180@xmath8 bonds and a weak ferromagnetic one for the 90@xmath8 bonds , the exchange interactions in these vanadates can be more complicated as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "even the signs of the many exchange couplings are not obvious in these materials .",
    "so one has to resort to _ ab - initio _ numerical calculations to get information about the relative as well as absolute values of the exchange couplings in these systems .",
    "the determination of the exchange couplings is crucial to understand the markedly different spin gap behavior in these compounds .    in this paper",
    ", we shall report on the _ ab - initio _ calculation of the exchange couplings using the lda+u method and discover that they are indeed different in these two compounds , consistent with their magnetic properties . as the various exchange couplings are related to the bare hopping matrix elements",
    ", we shall extract them using a recently developed systematic downfolding scheme  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the downfolding method is that only the important orbitals referred to as the active channels are retained in the basis and the rest are downfolded thereby providing a single or few band tight binding model capable of reproducing the details of the lda bands close to a prescribed energy , which is usually the fermi energy .",
    "we shall use such few band models to extract the various hopping matrix elements .",
    "this will form a basis to understand the widely different spin gap behavior in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we shall briefly recapitulate the crystal structure of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 . in section",
    "iii we shall present our lda+u calculations for the various exchange couplings and compare them with available experimental results .",
    "section  iv will be devoted to electronic structure calculations based on the tb - lmto method  @xcite , followed by the downfolding method to extract the various hopping matrix elements , in order to explain the different exchange couplings in these materials .",
    "finally the conclusions are given in section  v.    = 3.5 cm    2    = 4.2 cm = 4.2 cm",
    "the main building block of the crystal structures of ca(mg)v@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds are the v ions roughly in the center of a pyramid of oxygen ions as can be seen in fig .  2 .",
    "the crystal structure of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 is primitive orthorhombic with space group _ pmmn _ and lattice constants @xmath9=11.35   , @xmath10=3.60   , and @xmath11=4.89   . as shown in fig .",
    "2(left ) , the structure is formed by a linkage of vo@xmath1 pyramids having apex oxygens in the direction of the @xmath11-axis .",
    "oxygen edge- and corner - shared zigzag v chains are formed along the @xmath10-axis , where the nearest neighbor v - v distance is 3.03   . along the @xmath9-axis , these chains",
    "are linked by sharing corners with the v - v distance of 3.49   .",
    "it thus forms a quasi two dimensional ladder layer in the @xmath12 plane with the leg along the zigzag v chains ( _ i.e _ along @xmath10 ) while the rung in the perpendicular direction ( _ i.e. _ along @xmath9 ) .",
    "the ca atoms are located between the layers and are surrounded by eight o atoms .",
    "the crystal structure of mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 is base centered orthorhombic with space group @xmath13 ; and lattice constants @xmath9=11.02   , @xmath10=3.69   , and @xmath11=9.97   .",
    "again , the structure can be described as a linkage of vo@xmath1 pyramids having apex oxygens in the direction of the @xmath11-axis as can be seen in fig .",
    "2(right ) .",
    "the v zigzag chains extend along the @xmath9-axis by sharing edges and corners of the pyramids and the nearest neighbor v - v distance is 2.98   .",
    "they    = 5.0 cm    are also linked by sharing corners along the @xmath10-axis , with the v - v distance of 3.37   , which again leads to a quasi - two dimensional ladder layers in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "however in contrast to cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , these layers stack alternately with the distance of ( @xmath14 ) and the mg atoms are located between the layers and each are surrounded by six oxygen atoms . as a consequence",
    ", there is a puckering of the v@xmath0o@xmath1 layers to accommodate mg ions in the tetrahedral co - ordination .",
    "all the structural data that we have discussed above are summarized in table  1 and indicated in fig .",
    "it should be noted that as a consequence of the puckering of the v@xmath0o@xmath1 layers the tilting angle of the corner shared pyramids @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is appreciably smaller in mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 in comparison to cav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the lda+u method was shown to give good results for insulating transition metal oxides with a partially filled @xmath16-shell  @xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction parameters can be calculated using a procedure based on the green function method , developed by lichtenstein _ et .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to calculate the exchange couplings in kcuf@xmath2  @xcite and in layered cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the lda+u method  @xcite is the local density approximation ( lda ) modified by a potential correction restoring a proper description of the coulomb interaction between the localized @xmath16-electrons of transition metal ions .",
    "this is written in the form of a projection operator :    .structural data for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the lattice constants ( in  ) are @xmath9 along the rung of the ladder , @xmath10  along the leg , and @xmath11  in the vertical direction .",
    "the distances ( in  ) between nearest v ions between ladders , along the leg , the rung and the diagonal are denoted as d@xmath17 , d@xmath18 , d@xmath19 and d@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath15 ( figure  3 ) is between v - o - v where oxygen atom is placed between two vanadium atoms forming the rung .",
    "the angle @xmath21 is that between o - v - o where one is rung oxygen and the other is apical oxygen .",
    "finally the angle @xmath22 is o - v - o with both the oxygen atoms in the leg direction .",
    "all angle values are listed in degrees . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ valmodel ]    2",
    "we have used the lda+u method to compute the exchange couplings in the layered vanadate compounds cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "our calculation shows that a strong anisotropy exists between the rung and leg exchange couplings for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 thus making it a system of weakly coupled dimers along the rung with strong interaction inside the dimer , characterized by a large spin gap . on the other hand",
    "the rung and leg exchange couplings are found to be of comparable strength for mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 making it a small spin gap system .",
    "we have applied the recently developed third - generation lmto downfolding method and the subsequently fourier transformed the downfolded hamiltonian to extract the tight - binding hopping parameters between effective v@xmath23-v@xmath23 orbitals for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 , as well as for three different model systems .",
    "we conclude , that the stronger _ tilting _ of the vo@xmath1 pyramids in mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 crystal structure in comparison to cav@xmath0o@xmath1 is the reason that the exchange interactions along rung and leg are nearly identical in mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 while they are anisotropic in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 leading to the strikingly different magnetic properties of these materials .",
