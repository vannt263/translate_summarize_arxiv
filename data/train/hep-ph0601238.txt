    "in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite of particle physics , there are three types of interactions of fundamental particles : gauge interactions , yukawa interactions and the higgs boson self - interaction .",
    "the higgs boson @xcite plays an important role in the sm ; it is responsible for generating the masses of all the elementary particles ( leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons ) .",
    "however , the higgs - boson sector is the least tested in the sm , in particular the higgs boson self - interaction .",
    "the search for higgs bosons is one of the principal missions of present and future high - energy colliders .",
    "the observation of this particle is of major importance for the present understanding of fundamental particle interactions . indeed , in order to accommodate the well established electromagnetic and weak interaction phenomena , the existence of at least one isodoblete scalar field to generate fermion and weak gauge bosons masses is required . despite numerous successes in explaining the present data , the sm can not be completely tested before this particle has been experimentally observed and its fundamental properties studied .    in the sm ,",
    "the profile of the higgs particle is uniquely determined once its mass @xmath9 is fixed @xcite ; the decay width and branching , as well as the production cross sections , are given by the strength of the yukawa couplings to fermions and gauge bosons , which is set by the masses of these particles .",
    "however , the higgs boson mass is a free parameter with two experimental constraints .",
    "the sm higgs boson has been searched by lep in the higgs - strahlung process , @xmath10 , for c.m .",
    "energies up to @xmath11 @xmath6 and with a large collected luminosity . in the summer of 2002 ,",
    "the final results of the four lep collaborations were published and some changes were made with respect to the original publication .",
    "especially , the inclusion of more statistics , the revision of backgrounds , and the reassessment of systematic errors . when these results are combined , an upper limit @xmath12 @xmath6 is established at the @xmath13 confidence level @xcite .",
    "however , in the absence of additional events with respect to sm predictions , this upper limit was expected to be @xmath14 @xmath6 due to a @xmath15 excess [ compared to the value @xmath16 reported at the end of 2000 ] of events for a higgs boson mass in the vicinity of @xmath17 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the second constraint comes from the accuracy of the electroweak observables measured at lep , slac large detector ( slc ) , and the fermilab tevatron , which provide sensitivity to @xmath9 .",
    "the higgs boson contributes logarithmically , @xmath18 , to the radiative corrections to the @xmath19 boson propagators .",
    "the status , as found in summer 2002 , is summarized in reference @xcite . when taking into account all available data , ( i.e. the @xmath20-boson pole lep and slc data , the measurement of the @xmath21 boson mass and total width , the top - quark mass and the controversial nutev result ) one obtains a higgs boson mass of @xmath22 @xmath6 , which leads to a 95@xmath23 confidence level upper limit of @xmath24 @xmath6 @xcite .    a detailed study of the higgs potential represents a conclusive test of the symmetry breaking and mass generation mechanism .",
    "after discovering of an elementary higgs boson and testing its couplings to quarks , leptons and gauge bosons , a further proof of the higgs mechanism will be the experimental evidence that the higgs field potential has the properties required for breaking the electro - weak symmetry .",
    "the trilinear and quartic higgs boson couplings @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined through the potential    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the physical higgs field . in the sm",
    ", we obtain @xmath29 , as the simple relationship between the higgs boson mass @xmath30 and the self - coupling @xmath25 , where @xmath31 @xmath6 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson .",
    "the trilinear vertex of the higgs field @xmath32 is given by the coefficient @xmath33 and @xmath9 can be determined to @xmath34gev@xmath35 accuracy .",
    "an accurate test of this relationship may reveal the extended nature of the higgs sector .",
    "the measurement of the triple higgs boson coupling is one of the most important goals of higgs physics in a future @xmath36 linear collider experiment .",
    "this would provide the first direct information on the higgs potential that is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the trilinear higgs self - coupling can be measured directly in pair - production of higgs particles at hadron and high - energy @xmath36 linear colliders .",
    "several mechanisms that are sensitive to @xmath37 can be exploited for this task .",
    "higgs pairs can be produced through double higgs - strahlung of @xmath21 or @xmath38 bosons @xcite , @xmath39 or @xmath40 fusion @xcite ; moreover , through gluon - gluon fusion in @xmath41 collisions @xcite and high - energy @xmath42 fusion @xcite at photon colliders .",
    "the two main processes at @xmath36 colliders are double higgs - strahlung and @xmath39 fusion :    @xmath43    the @xmath40 fusion process of higgs pairs is suppressed by an order of magnitude because the electron - z coupling is small . however , the process @xmath44 has been studied @xcite extensively .",
    "this three - body process is important because it is sensitive to yukawa couplings . the inclusion of four - body processes with heavy fermions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , in which the sm higgs boson is radiated by a @xmath47 quark at future @xmath0 colliders @xcite with a c.m .",
    "energy in the range of 800 to 1500 @xmath6 , as in the case of desy tev energy superconducting linear accelerator ( tesla ) machine @xcite , is necessary in order to know its impact on three - body mode processes and also to search for new relations that could have a clear signature of the higgs boson production .",
    "the higgs coupling with top quarks , the largest coupling in the sm , is directly accessible in the process where the higgs boson is radiated off top quarks , @xmath48 , followed by the process @xmath49 .",
    "this processes depends on the higgs boson triple self - coupling , which could lead us to obtain the first non - trivial information on the higgs potential .",
    "we are interested in finding regions that could allow the observation of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 processes at the next generation of high energy @xmath0 linear colliders .",
    "we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level ( figs . 1 , 2 ) and use the calchep @xcite packages to evaluate the amplitudes and cross section .    at the linear collider ,",
    "the triple higgs coupling @xmath37 can be accessed by studying multiple higgs production in the reactions @xmath50 and @xmath51 that are sensitive to the triple higgs vertex .",
    "the first process is more relevant at lower values of the center - of - mass energy @xmath52 , and for the higgs boson masses in the range @xmath53 @xmath6 .",
    "the second process is more relevant at collision energies above 1 @xmath54 and ensures sensitivity to the triple higgs vertex for intermediate range higgs masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we study the triple higgs self - coupling through the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 at next generation linear @xmath0 colliders . in sec .",
    "iii , we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 with double higgs production .",
    "we carry out the calculations using the framework of the standard model at next generation linear @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we use calchep @xcite packages for calculations of the matrix elements and cross - sections .",
    "these packages provide automatic computation of the cross - sections and distributions in the sm as well as their extensions at tree - level .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes are studied , including a complete set of feynman diagrams .",
    "we consider the high energy stage of a possible next linear @xmath0 collider with @xmath55 @xmath6 and design luminosity 1000 @xmath8 .    for the sm parameters , we have adopted the following : the weinber angle @xmath56 , the mass ( @xmath57 @xmath6 ) of the bottom quark , the mass ( @xmath58 @xmath6 ) of the top quark , and the mass ( @xmath59 @xmath6 ) of the @xmath20 , taking the mass @xmath9 of the higgs boson as input @xcite .",
    "to illustrate our results of the sensitivity to the @xmath60 triple higgs self - coupling , we show the @xmath61 dependence of the total cross - section for @xmath1 in fig .",
    "we consider one representative value of the higgs mass @xmath62 @xmath6 with the center - of - mass energy of @xmath63 @xmath6 and varying the trilinear coupling @xmath64 within the range @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "clearly , the cross - section is sensitive to the value of the trilinear couplings . since the @xmath67 cross - section and its sensitivity to @xmath37 decrease with increasing collider energy , a linear collider operating at 800 @xmath6 offers the opportunity for a precise measurement of @xmath37 for @xmath68 @xmath6 .",
    "4 shows the total cross - section as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath52 for one value of the higgs mass @xmath69 @xmath6 and for several values of @xmath61 .",
    "we observe in this figure that the total cross - section of @xmath67 is of the order @xmath70 @xmath71 for higgs mass @xmath69 @xmath6 and @xmath72 .",
    "the cross sections are at the femtobarn fraction level and they quickly drop with the increase of the center - of - mass energy . under these conditions , it would be very difficult to extract any useful information about the higgs self - coupling from the studied process unless the @xmath36 machine works with very high luminosity .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath1 as function of the center - of - mass energy , with @xmath73 @xmath6 and @xmath74 is presented in fig .",
    "the cross - sections are shown for unpolarized electron and positron beams .",
    "as in fig .",
    "4 , the cross - section is at the femtobarn fraction level and decreases with rising energy .",
    "however , the cross - section increases with rising self - coupling in the vicinity of the sm value .",
    "we observe in figs . 4 and 5 that the cross - section decreases as energy increases .",
    "at some given energy , the maximum total cross - section value is @xmath75 , depending on the higgs mass .",
    "since fermion chirality is conserved at the @xmath76 vertex , the cross section may increase by practically twice when electrons and positrons are polarized .",
    "our conclusion is that for higgs masses in the intermediate mass range and rising self - coupling in the vicinity of the sm value , a visible number of events would be produced as illustrated in tables i - iii .    for center - of - mass energies of 800 - 1500 @xmath6 and high luminosity ,",
    "the possibility of a detailed study of the triple higgs boson self - coupling via the process @xmath3 is promising as shown in tables i - iii .",
    "thus , a high - luminosity @xmath36 linear collider is a very high precision machine in the context of higgs physics",
    ". this precision would allow the determination of the complete profile of the sm higgs boson , in particular if its mass is smaller than @xmath77 @xmath6 .    [",
