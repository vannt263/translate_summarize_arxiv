    "air - shower simulations are an essential tool in cosmic - ray physics @xcite .",
    "primary particles reach the earth with energies of up to @xmath5  gev , in particular , auger is exposed to around 15,000 events of energy above @xmath6  gev ( @xmath7 of them hybrid ) per year @xcite .",
    "such energies are well above the ones explored at colliders , and the simulation of these events requires then an extrapolation of the _ known _ physics that could be affected by several factors . on one hand , there could be new particles or interactions not accessible at lower energies . in this sense , cosmic rays may offer opportunities in the search for strong tev gravity @xcite , new neutrino interactions @xcite , or long - lived massive particles @xcite . on the other hand , cosmic - ray energies may imply a regime where the properties of standard particles can be substantially _",
    "different_. consider , in particular , the hadrons containing a charm or a bottom quark , whose properties are well known from collider experiments .",
    "the lightest mode with a given quark content will always decay through a weak interaction , implying a relatively long lifetime ( @xmath8@xmath9 mm ) .",
    "although at the tevatron or the lhc very energetic heavy hadrons may define events with observable displaced vertices , such hadrons will never reach the calorimeters there .",
    "in contrast , when produced with energies above @xmath10  gev inside an extensive air shower ( eas ) their decay length becomes larger than 10 km , and they tend to collide in the atmosphere instead of decaying .",
    "the collisions with matter of these long - lived heavy hadrons would introduce physics unseen at colliders .",
    "this physics will certainly occur in extensive air showers , and its inclusion in the simulation may be necessary to explain rare effects or just as a standard background in the search for genuine exotics .    the heavy quark inside an ultrarelativistic @xmath11 or @xmath12 meson carries most of the hadron energy .",
    "if the meson collides with an air nucleus and _ breaks _ into several pieces , it is obvious that the piece carrying the heavy quark will take most of the energy after the collision .",
    "therefore , at @xmath13  gev these particles become long lived and much more penetrating than a proton or a pion : a simulation seems necessary to establish whether heavy mesons are effective in taking a significant fraction of this energy deep into the atmosphere .",
    "in addition , at energies above 100  gev pions and kaons become less effective producing atmospheric muons and neutrinos ( they tend to collide with air nuclei instead of decaying ) , and the spectral index in the lepton flux that they yield is reduced in one unit @xcite . the prompt decay of charmed hadrons",
    "has been extensively studied @xcite as the dominant source of leptons at pev energies ( see also @xcite ) . the non - prompt charm contribution ( from charm decaying after one or several collisions in the air )",
    ", however , may be not negligible , specially at higher energies , and its inclusion in the simulation requires an estimate of propagation effects .    in this article we report on the inclusion of heavy - quark production and propagation in the air - shower simulator aires @xcite .",
    "aires provides full space - time shower development in a realistic environment , taking into account the atmospheric density profile , the earth s curvature , and the geomagnetic field .",
    "the new version of the simulator used in this work recognizes and propagates photons , electrons , positrons , muons , neutrinos , pions , kaons , eta mesons , lambda baryons , nucleons , antinucleons , nuclei up to @xmath14 , as well as @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons , @xmath15 baryons , and tau leptons ( which may appear in @xmath1 decays ) .",
    "aires is able to process complex decay schemes with a large number of branches , as it is the case for heavy hadrons .",
    "nucleus - nucleus , hadron - nucleus , and photon - nucleus inelastic collisions with significant cross - sections are taken into account via calls to external hadronic packages .    for the present work we have developed a hadronic interaction preprocessor ( hqip , for heavy quark interaction preprocessor ) that simulates collisions including heavy hadrons .",
    "the algorithms used in hqip are based on a perturbative qcd framework that is described in some detail in section [ sect : charmbot ] .",
    "when processing high energy hadronic collisions , hqip complements the usual hadronic packages ( sibyll  @xcite or qgsjet  @xcite ) .",
    "if hqip is invoked the charm production option in the external hadronic package is set to disabled .",
    "the production of heavy quarks in nucleus - nucleus and photon - nucleus collisions has not been implemented yet .",
    "the impact of charm production in air showers has been previously discussed in @xcite .",
    "that work , however , does not include bottom quark production nor the propagation of heavy hadrons in the atmosphere ( _ i.e. _ , their possible collisions with air nuclei ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : charmbot ] we discuss the production cross sections and the inelasticities in heavy meson collisions with air nuclei that we have used . in section [ sect : showerdevel ] we illustrate the performance of aires with a study of the energy and depth distributions of heavy hadron production and decay for a vertical proton primary of fixed @xmath16  gev energy .",
    "finally , we discuss the spectrum of muons and the production of very energetic tau leptons from heavy quark decays for the same proton primary .",
    "heavy - quark production by cosmic rays has been considered by a number of groups ( see @xcite for a review ) . at ultrahigh energies",
    "the usual calculation of the partonic process using perturbative qcd is very dependent on the small-@xmath17 gluon distribution , giving results that can vary by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "instead , we will base our cross sections on the color dipole picture @xcite described in detail in @xcite , which incorporates in a simple way saturation and nuclear effects and yields much smaller uncertainties . within this picture",
    "a gluon carrying a fraction @xmath18 of the projectile energy fluctuates into a @xmath19 dipole that interacts coherently with the gluon field in the target ( the @xmath20 gluons form a color glass condensate ) and evolves into hadrons .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     tau leptons are mainly produced in @xmath1 decays .",
    "they may introduce interesting effects because their decay length ( @xmath21 @xmath22 m ) reaches 5 km at @xmath10  gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig5]left ( right ) we plot the point and energy where they are produced ( decay ) inside the shower .",
    "we find 23 tau leptons of energy above @xmath23  gev per 1000 showers .",
    "they are produced at an average depth of 270  g / cm@xmath4 and decay at 320  g / cm@xmath4 , in particular , 18% of them decay after 600  g / cm@xmath4 .",
    "for example , in the energy bin between @xmath10 and @xmath25  gev we obtain 2.2 tau leptons per 1000 vertical showers , with 0.8 of them reaching the ground .",
    "therefore , the frequency of very energetic taus produced in eas that decay near the ground is similar to the frequency of the analogous @xmath12-meson events .",
    "muons , on the other hand , are a key prediction in air - shower simulations .",
    "although the presence of heavy hadrons will not introduce significant differences in the _ total _ number of muons at the ground level , there are other observables that may be more sensitive to these heavy hadrons .",
    "in particular , one could expect two types of effects .    * _ rare events with late energy deposition _ from the decay of a heavy meson or a @xmath26 lepton .",
    "a @xmath10  gev deposition relatively near the ground would produce muons and other charged particles that could change significantly the shower profile seen in the fluorescence telescopes and/or the temporal distribution observed in the surface detectors .",
    "the fraction of these rare events is approximately 0.5% . *",
    "_ leptons of pev energies_. at very high energies pions tend to collide in the air instead of decaying thus becoming a less effective source of muons @xcite .",
    "this shows up clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where we plot the energy distribution of muons reaching the ground for a 30  eev proton primary .",
    "the distribution in showers simulated using hqip is almost 5 times larger than the one with no heavy quark production at pev energies .",
    "these very energetic muons may be observable at neutrino telescopes @xcite , and they could be used to estimate the correlated neutrino flux .    ]",
    "at energies above @xmath10  gev hadrons containing a charm or a bottom quark become long lived , and it is then necessary to implement their collisions with air nuclei in air shower simulations .",
    "although the interactions with matter of @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons are not observable at colliders , one expects that they are much more elastic than pion or proton collisions .",
    "the main effect of these particles would derive from their ability to transport energy deep into the atmosphere .",
    "since the fraction of events with a very energetic heavy hadron is small , one can not expect significant differences in the features of the average shower .",
    "in particular , we have studied common observables like the lateral and the longitudinal distributions of charged particles , and in all cases we could not observe any relevant differences due to heavy quark effects .",
    "instead , one could look for anomalous events with late energy deposition caused by their decay .",
    "we have included both the production and the propagation of heavy hadrons in a new version of aires . to illustrate the performance of the code , we have simulated 10,000 vertical showers of fixed 30  eev energy .",
    "we find around one @xmath11 meson of energy above @xmath10  gev per 2 showers , or just one @xmath12 meson in this energy range per 26 showers .",
    "a few per mille of these air showers includes a @xmath12 meson of energy above @xmath23  gev hitting the ground at 1000  g / cm@xmath4 .",
    "the frequency of very energetic tau leptons from @xmath1 decays reaching large atmospheric depths is slightly higher .",
    "the uncertainty in all these rates combines a @xmath27 variation in the production cross sections with the uncertainty in the inelasticity of heavy hadron ",
    "nucleus collisions , that is more difficult to estimate since such process can not be observed at colliders .",
    "therefore , we think that a search for possible signals associated to these rare events should be considered even if the expected rates are small .    the results presented here point to different air shower observables that may reflect the production of heavy quarks , but a definite determination of their observability would require the generation of air showers of different energies and from different inclinations .",
    "the inclusion of heavy hadrons in aires opens the possibility to optimize such a search .",
    "we would like to thank javier albacete , antonio bueno , and alberto gascn for useful discussions .",
