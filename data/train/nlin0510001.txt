    "nonlinear integrable models of dispersionless type @xcite-@xcite arise in several branches of physics and applied mathematics .",
    "they have gained prominence after the discovery of their relevance in the formalism of quantum topological fields @xcite-@xcite , and of their role in the theory of deformations of conformal and quasiconformal maps on the complex plane @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , new applications have been found @xcite-@xcite which include dynamics of conformal maps , growth processes of laplacian type and large @xmath1 limits of random matrix partition functions .    from the point of view of the theory of integrable systems , these models turn to be furnished by members of the so called _ universal whitham hierarchies",
    "_ introduced by krichever in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a particularly important example of these hierarchies is the dispersionless toda ( dtoda ) hierarchy @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the solutions of dispersionless integrable models underlying many of their applications satisfy special systems of constraints called _ string equations _ , which posses attractive mathematical properties and interesting physical meaning .",
    "takasaki and takebe @xcite-@xcite showed the relevance of string equations for studying the dispersionless kp and toda hierarchies and , in particular , for characterizing their associated symmetry groups . nevertheless , although some schemes for solving string equations in the dispersionless kp and toda hierarchies were provided in @xcite-@xcite , general efficient methods of solution for",
    "string equations are still lacking .    in a recent work @xcite a general formalism of whitham hierarchies based on a factorization problem on a lie group of canonical transformations has been proposed .",
    "it leads to a natural formulation of string equations in terms of dressing transformations .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the analysis of these string equations and , in particular , their applications for characterizing exact solutions of whitham hierarchies .",
    "thus we provide a solution scheme for an special class of string equations which determines not only the solutions of the algebraic orbits of the whitham hierarchy @xcite , but also the solutions arising in the above mentioned applications of dispersionless integrable models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we characterize the @xmath0-function corresponding to these solutions and , by taking advantage of the string equations , we also derive the differential expressions of the underlying virasoro constraints .",
    "the elements of the phase space for a zero genus whitham hierarchy are characterized by a finite set @xmath2 of _ punctures _",
    "@xmath3 , where @xmath4 , of the complex @xmath5-plane and an associated set of local coordinates of the form @xmath6 the set of flows of the whitham hierarchy can be formulated as the following infinite system of quasiclassical lax equations @xmath7 where the poisson bracket is defined as @xmath8 and the hamiltonian functions are @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for the projectors on the subspaces generated by @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the corresponding spaces of laurent series .",
    "henceforth , it will be assumed that appropriate non - intersecting cuts connecting @xmath14 with the points @xmath15 are made which allow us to define the logarithmic branches associated with @xmath16 . since several of these branches will appear simultaneously in certain equations , to avoid possible misunderstanding we introduce the notation convention @xmath17 . for @xmath18 and @xmath19 these systems represent the dispersionless versions of the kp and toda hierarchies , respectively .    in what follows greek and latin suffixes will be used to label indices of the sets @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . in our analysis",
    "we use an extended lax formalism with orlov functions @xmath22 such that @xmath23 and verifying the same lax equations as the variables @xmath24 .",
    "the basic notions about the whitham hierarchy which are necessary for the subsequent discussion are introduced in sec .",
    "string equations and symmetries are discussed in sec.3 , where the main results concerning the construction of solutions from meromorphic string equations and their virasoro invariance are proved .",
    "section 4 presents a scheme for solving an special class of string equations , which is illustrated with several explicit examples .",
    "a formula for the corresponding @xmath0-function is given which generalizes the expression of the @xmath0-function of analytic curves found in @xcite .",
    "finally , we analize the virasoro symmetries associated to the string equations and obtain the corresponding virasoro constraints in differential form .",
    "in order to display the main features of the whitham hierarchy it is convenient to use the following concise formulation in terms of the system of equations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the one - form defined by @xmath27 to see how to get from the system to the whitham hierarchy , note that by identifying the coefficients of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in we obtain    @xmath30    and , in particular , since @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , the system implies @xmath33 thus , using this fact and solving for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we deduce @xmath36    it is now natural to introduce the @xmath37-functions of the whitham hierarchy .",
    "indeed as a consequence of we find @xmath38 so that there exist functions @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and from we see that they admit expansions of the form @xmath41 it is important to notice that from - and it follows that @xmath42 and consequently we may take @xmath43    [ fig 1 ]     and @xmath44,width=491 ]    to proceed further some analytic properties of the dynamical variables of the whitham hierarchy are required .",
    "thus we will henceforth suppose that there exist positively oriented closed curves @xmath44 in the complex planes of the variables @xmath45 such that each function @xmath46 determines a conformal map of the right - exterior of a circle @xmath47 on the exterior of @xmath44 ( we will assume that the circle @xmath48 encircles all the @xmath49 ) ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , for each @xmath50 the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 will be assumed to be analytic in the exterior of @xmath53 .    under the above conditions one can prove that @xmath54 where",
    "the functions @xmath55 are defined by @xmath56 and we are denoting @xmath57 in other words , it is ensured the existence of a _ free - energy function _",
    "@xmath58 , the logarithm @xmath59 of the _ dispersionless _ @xmath0-function , verifying @xmath60    let us first prove for the case @xmath61 . from the equations @xmath62 it follows that @xmath63 so that the functions defined in satisfy @xmath64 we indicate the strategy for proving the remaining cases of by considering the choice @xmath65 of . from and it follows that @xmath66 so that @xmath67 where we have taken into account that @xmath68 is a rational function of @xmath5 which has finite poles at @xmath15 and @xmath69 only and a zero residue at @xmath70 .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the analysis of the factorization problem for the whitham hierarchy shows that this hierarchy admits a natural formulation in terms of systems of string equations of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 are pairs of canonically conjugate variables @xmath73 in what follows we consider the problem of finding systems of the form which are appropriate to generate exact solutions of the whitham hierarchy .",
    "given a solution @xmath74 of a system , if we denote @xmath75 then and imply @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "hence solutions of the system of string equations verify @xmath78 the next result provides a convenient framework for our subsequent discussion of solutions of .",
    "let @xmath74 be a solution of which admits expansions of the form - and such that the coefficients of the the two - forms are meromorphic functions of the complex variable @xmath5 with finite poles at @xmath79 only .",
    "then @xmath74 is a solution of the whitham hierarchy .    in view of the hypothesis of the theorem the coefficients of the two - forms with respect to the basis @xmath80",
    "are determined by their principal parts at @xmath81 , so that by taking into account we may write @xmath82 moreover the terms in these decompositions can be found by using the expansions of the functions @xmath83 as follows @xmath84 so that @xmath85 thus we find @xmath86 and , consequently , this proves that the functions @xmath74 determine a solution of the whitham hierarchy .    following the dressing scheme of @xcite-@xcite",
    "it can be shown @xcite that each solution of the whitham hierarchy is determined by an associated system of string equations .    as it was shown in @xcite a complete formulation of the symmetry group of the whitham hierarchy",
    "is obtained by considering deformations of the associated factorization problem . on the other hand , a natural representation of this group",
    "is provided by the following symmetries of string equations implemented by hamiltonian vector fields :    given a vector function @xmath87 the infinitesimal deformation @xmath88 where @xmath89 determines a symmetry of the system of string equations .",
    "we have to prove that given a solution @xmath90 of , then at first order in @xmath91 @xmath92 for all @xmath93 .",
    "let us consider the first group of equations of , they can be rewritten as @xmath94 or , equivalently , by taking into account , as @xmath95 by hypothesis @xmath96 . on the other hand @xmath97",
    "so that is satisfied .",
    "the proof for the second group of equations of is identical .",
    "we note that the condition for a solution @xmath90 of the string equations to be invariant under a symmetry is @xmath98 or equivalently @xmath99 in other words , the functions @xmath100 must reduce to a unique meromorphic function of @xmath5 with finite poles at the punctures @xmath15 only . as a consequence it follows that , under the hypothesis of theorem 1 , solutions of the whitham hierarchy satisfying a system of string equations are invariant under the symmetries generated by @xmath101 and , more generally , they are invariant under the symmetries generated by @xmath102 which determine a poisson lie algebra @xmath103 of symmetries @xmath104 in particular the functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 generate two virasoro algebras . @xmath107",
    "in @xcite a class of string equations was introduced which manifests special properties with respect to the group of dressing transformations .",
    "we next provide a scheme of solution for this class .",
    "let us consider systems of string equations associated to splittings @xmath108 of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 are arbitrary positive integers . for @xmath111",
    "these systems furnish the solutions describing the algebraic orbits of the whitham hierarchy @xcite , while the case @xmath112 includes the systems of string equations considered by takasaki @xcite and wiegmann - zabrodin @xcite-@xcite in their applications of the dtoda hierarchy .",
    "the discussion of our scheme for solving requires the consideration of the two cases @xmath111 and @xmath113 separately . in what follows we consider solutions with only a finite number of times @xmath114 different from zero .",
    "the corresponding system is given by @xmath115 the first group of equations is satisfied by setting @xmath116 and , obviously , appropriate branches of @xmath45 can be defined which are compatible with the required asymptotic expansions .",
    "on the other hand , notice that the remaining string equations in can be rewritten as @xmath117 so that they are verified by taking @xmath118 for a given function @xmath119 , which means that all the @xmath51 are equal to @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to prove that the expansions are satisfied if we set @xmath120 in order to satisfy the hypothesis of theorem 1 , the functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 must be rational functions of @xmath5 with possible finite poles at the points @xmath15 only . in view of this condition is verified by @xmath123 . on the other hand , and imply that @xmath124 therefore , the requirements of theorem 1 are satisfied provided that @xmath125 where @xmath126 are the zeros of @xmath127 we observe that the number of zeros @xmath126 is @xmath128 which equals the number of unknowns @xmath129 .",
    "equations coincide with those formulated by krichever in @xcite for determining the algebraic orbits of the whitham hierarchy .",
    "now we consider the system for the generic case @xmath113 .",
    "we look for functions @xmath52 of the form @xmath140 for arbitrary positive integers @xmath141 . in order to verify the hypothesis of theorem 1 and the expansions",
    ", we set @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 , the poles @xmath15 and the coefficients of @xmath145 and @xmath146 are to be determined .    by introducing the functions @xmath147 and taking - into account it follows that the system of string equations reduces to @xmath148 on the other hand , due to their rational character , the functions @xmath149 can be written in terms of their principal parts at the poles @xmath150 @xmath151 and by taking into account we get @xmath152 therefore is satisfied by @xmath153 provided @xmath154 verifies the equation @xmath155    at this point notice that from , and it follows that is the only equation to be satisfied in order to solve the system of string equations .",
    "both sides of are rational functions of @xmath5 with finite poles at @xmath79 only , so that holds if and only if the principal parts of both members at @xmath156 coincide .",
    "now we have that :    * at @xmath157 , the function @xmath154 has a pole of order @xmath158 , while @xmath159 has a pole of order @xmath160 , consequently requires that @xmath161 , so that identifying the principal parts at @xmath162 represents @xmath163 equations .",
    "* at @xmath164 , the function @xmath154 has a pole of order @xmath165 and @xmath159 has a pole of order @xmath166 .",
    "hence @xmath167 and identifying the corresponding principal parts leads to @xmath165 equations .",
    "* at @xmath168 , the function @xmath154 has a pole of order @xmath169 and @xmath159 has a pole of order @xmath170 .",
    "hence @xmath171 and identifying the corresponding principal parts leads to @xmath169 equations .",
    "thus , eq . leads to @xmath172 equations . on the other hand we have @xmath173 unknown coefficients given by @xmath174",
    "the additional @xmath175 equations required for determining these coefficients arise by imposing the asymptotic behaviour - to @xmath90 . note that and imply that the functions @xmath176 have the asymptotic form . in what concerns the functions @xmath52 , from the expression for @xmath154 it follows that @xmath177 so that @xmath178 satisfies an expansion of the form . but in order for @xmath179 to satisfy we must impose that @xmath180 however , let us see that as a consequence of the string equations it follows that @xmath181 and , consequently , only @xmath175 of the equations need to be imposed .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath182 on the other hand , and imply @xmath183 @xmath184 so that            note that in this case all the equations come from .",
    "we set @xmath190 from one obtains the system @xmath191 and by solving these equations we find @xmath192 where @xmath193 is determined by the implicit equation @xmath194      in this case there are three punctures @xmath198 and we have to impose equation for @xmath199 .",
    "we take @xmath200 then , by identifying powers of @xmath5 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 in the following system of equations arises @xmath203 moreover , by taking into account , from we get @xmath204 these equations lead to @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 is determined by the equation : @xmath208      in this case we take @xmath210 by equating the coefficients of @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 in one finds @xmath215 and leads to the equation @xmath216 by solving these equations one obtains @xmath217 @xmath218 where @xmath219 @xmath220 and @xmath221 satisfies the equation : @xmath222      according to the identities @xmath223 it follows at once from , and that the functions @xmath224 are rational functions of @xmath5 with finite poles at the points @xmath225 only .",
    "thus we may decompose the functions @xmath224 into their principal parts @xmath226 and , in view of the assymptotic behaviour , we may write @xmath227 where @xmath228 furthermore , from , and we obtain @xmath229 which leads to @xmath230 in principle implies the expressions plus additional @xmath5-independent terms @xmath231 . however these terms can be removed by using and . indeed , the assymptotic behavior for @xmath232 requires @xmath233 . on the other hand",
    "says that @xmath234 so that by using the string equations we deduce @xmath235        our strategy to prove is to start from the free - energy function for the algebraic orbits of the whitham hierarchy @xcite @xmath237 and determine the appropriate modifications to get the free - energy function for the solutions of the class of string equations .    by differentiating @xmath238 with respect to @xmath239",
    "we get @xmath240 and arguing as in the derivation of , we find that @xmath241 on the other hand , for @xmath242 we have @xmath243 so that @xmath244 and the same expression turns out to hold for @xmath245 .",
    "hence can be rewritten as @xmath246 furthermore , we have that @xmath247 so that from and by taking into account that @xmath248 we get @xmath249 which shows that @xmath250    by a similar procedure one finds @xmath251 nevertheless , proving that @xmath252 requires a more involved analysis .",
    "firstly we differentiate @xmath238 with respect to @xmath253 @xmath254 and use the following relations @xmath255",
    "@xmath256 @xmath257 @xmath258 then becomes @xmath259 furthermore , from the asymptotic expansion of @xmath260 we have that @xmath261 which allows us to rewrite in the form @xmath262 now by using it is straightforward to see that @xmath263 which shows that is equivalent to .",
    "we will outline how our scheme applies for characterizing dtoda dynamics of conformal maps , and , in particular , how gives rise to the expression of the @xmath0-function of analytic curves found in @xcite .",
    "given a simply - connected domain @xmath264 bounded by a closed path @xmath265 in the @xmath266-plane , there exist @xcite a unique circle @xmath267 in the @xmath5-plane and a unique conformal map @xmath268 satisfying @xmath269 such that @xmath268 transforms the exterior of @xmath267 into the exterior of @xmath265 ( see figure 2 ) . note that the conformal map used by wiegmann - zabrodin @xcite is given by @xmath270 , where @xmath193 and @xmath207 are the center and the radius of @xmath267 , respectively .",
    "let us define the function @xmath271 where @xmath272 denotes the inversion with respect to the circle @xmath267 @xmath273 it is clear that @xmath274 if @xmath265 is asssumed to be an analytic curve , then it can be described by an equation of the form @xmath275 where @xmath276 ( the schwarz function ) is analytic in a neigborhood of @xmath267 .",
    "thus , if @xmath265 encircles the origin , @xmath277 can be expanded as @xmath278 where the coefficients @xmath279 , the exterior harmonic moments of @xmath265 , determine the curve @xmath265 and the conformal map .",
    "note , in particular , that the coefficient @xmath280 @xmath281 represents the area of @xmath264 .    in this way , by considering the harmonic moments as independent complex parameters , if we define @xmath282 we obtain a solution of the system of string equations @xmath283 furthermore , by taking into account that @xmath284 and the identity @xmath285 we see that reduces to @xmath286 where @xmath287 , which is the expression for the @xmath0-function associated to analytic curves obtained in @xcite .",
    "notice that is the simplest nontrivial case ( @xmath288 ) of the class of string equations .      as we proved above , solutions @xmath90 of systems of string equations are invariant under the symmetries @xmath289 moreover , as a consequence of we",
    "have that the following identities hold @xmath290 for the values of the functions @xmath291 and @xmath292 at a solution @xmath90 .",
    "in particular these identities lead to the following expressions for the constraints arising from the invariance of under the action of @xmath293 .",
