    "during the last decade , a quantum tunneling of magnetization has become among the most actively studied topics in a condensed matter physics .",
    "the immense interest aimed at better understanding of this quantum phenomenon has been mainly stimulated by a recent experimental observation of the quantum spin tunneling in a large number of single - molecule magnets ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . by the term single - molecule magnet one",
    "denotes an assembly of weakly interacting clusters of magnetic metal atoms that usually possess an extraordinary strong magnetic anisotropy .",
    "hence , the single - molecule magnets often provide very good examples of magnetic systems with a strong uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy , i.e. so - called ising - like spin systems . of course , the ising - type interaction by itself can not be a source of the quantum spin tunneling experimentally observed in these systems .",
    "it turns out , however , that this quantum phenomenon arises in the most cases due to the higher - order crystal - field terms .",
    "according to a number of experimental and theoretical studies it is now quite well established that the spin tunneling observed in fe@xmath4 @xcite , fe@xmath5 @xcite , fe@xmath6 @xcite , or mn@xmath7",
    "@xcite clusters originates to a major extent from a second - order biaxial crystal - field potential .",
    "extensive studies focused on the magnetic properties of small clusters shed light on the effect of single - ion anisotropy terms @xmath8 ( uniaxial anisotropy ) and @xmath9 ( biaxial , also called rhombic anisotropy ) . in contrast to a quite well understood role of both single - ion anisotropies in the small magnetic clusters ( zero - dimensional systems ) , the situation becomes much more complex and also obscure in one- and two - dimensional spin systems .",
    "in fact , ground - state properties of a spin-@xmath10 ising model with the rhombic crystal - field potential @xmath9 have been only recently examined by oitmaa and von brasch within an effective mapping to the transverse ising model @xcite . on the basis of this effective mapping",
    ", a zero - temperature quantum critical point can be exactly located in the one - dimensional model , while for the two - dimensional models , they can be estimated with a high numerical accuracy using the linked - cluster expansion method @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic behavior of these models has not been investigated at non - zero temperatures beyond the standard mean - field and effective - field theories @xcite , random phase approximation @xcite , or above mentioned linked cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the biaxial anisotropy essentially influences magnetic properties of a large number of polymeric molecular - based magnetic materials , too . from the most obvious examples one could mention : nif@xmath3 @xcite ,",
    "nino@xmath11.6h@xmath3o @xcite , ni(ch@xmath11coo)@xmath3.4h@xmath3o @xcite , mn(ch@xmath11coo)@xmath3.3h@xmath3o @xcite , cof@xmath3 @xcite , cocl@xmath3.6h@xmath3o @xcite and a series of compounds @xmath12 @xcite , where x stands for halides and dc for the dithiocarbamate or diselenocarbamate groups , respectively .    in this article , we will focus on the effect of uniaxial and biaxial crystal - field potentials affecting the magnetic behavior of mixed spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 honeycomb lattice .",
    "when assuming the ising - type exchange interaction between nearest neighbors , the model becomes exactly solvable within an extended star - triangle mapping transformation .",
    "thus , the considered model provides a noble example of statistical system , which enables to study an interplay between quantum effects and temperature in a spontaneously ordered magnetic system .",
    "moreover , a magnetic structure of the mixed - spin honeycomb lattice occurs rather frequently also in the molecular magnetism , what clearly demonstrates a large family of polymeric two - dimensional compounds of following chemical formula : @xmath13 @xcite , where a@xmath14 stands for a non - magnetic univalent cation @xmath15 or @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , m@xmath18 and m@xmath19 denote two- and three - valent metal atoms cu@xmath20 , ni@xmath21 , co@xmath22 , fe@xmath23 or mn@xmath24 and respectively , cr@xmath25 or fe@xmath26 .",
    "actually , it turns out that the crystal structure of these polymeric molecular - based magnetic materials consists of the well - separated two - dimensional layers , in which regularly alternating m@xmath18 and m@xmath19 magnetic metal atoms constitute more or less regular honeycomb lattice ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in consequence of a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy of these materials",
    ", one should also expect a relatively strong uniaxial ( ising - like ) anisotropy , as it has already been suggested in the theoretical studies based on the effective - field theory and monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "hence , the magnetic compounds from the family of oxalates @xmath13 represent good candidates to be described by the proposed model .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "a detailed description of the model system is presented and then , some basic aspects of the transformation method will be shown .",
    "section 3 deals with a physical interpretation of the most interesting results and finally , some concluding remarks are drawn in section 4 .",
    "let us consider a magnetic structure of the mixed - spin honeycomb lattice , as it is schematically depicted in fig",
    ". 1 . to ensure exact tractability of the model system",
    ", we will further suppose that the sites of sublattice @xmath27 are occupied by the spin-1/2 atoms ( depicted as full circles ) , in contrast to the sites of sublattice @xmath28 that are occupied by the spin-3/2 atoms ( open circles ) .",
    "assuming the ising - type exchange interaction @xmath29 between nearest - neighboring spin pairs only , the total hamiltonian of the system reads : @xmath30 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a total number of sites at each sublattice , @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote standard spatial components of the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 operators , respectively .",
    "the first summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is carried out over nearest - neighboring spin pairs , while the other two summations run over the sites of sublattice @xmath28 .",
    "apparently , the last two terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the crystal - field potentials that measure a strength of uniaxial and biaxial anisotropies acting on the spin-3/2 atoms .",
    "it is also worthy to note that there is one - to - one correspondence between the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) and the effective spin hamiltonian with three different single - ion anisotropy terms @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 as a matter of fact , one can easily prove the equivalence between ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) using following mapping relations between the relevant interaction parameters : @xmath38 it should be also mentioned here that by neglecting the biaxial anisotropy , i.e. setting @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) or equivalently @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , our model reduces to the exactly soluble model settled by gonalves @xcite several years ago .",
    "accordingly , the main attention will be focused here on the effect of biaxial anisotropy , which influences thermodynamical and dynamical properties in a crucial manner . really , the @xmath9-term related to the biaxial crystal - field anisotropy should cause non - trivial quantum effects , since it introduces the @xmath41 and @xmath42 components of spin operators into the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) . as a result , it is responsible for the onset of local quantum fluctuations that are obviously missing in the ising model with the uniaxial crystal - field potential @xmath8 only .",
    "it is therefore of interest to discuss an origin of the biaxial crystal - field potential @xmath9 .",
    "the origin of this anisotropy term consists in the low - symmetry crystal field of ligands from the local neighborhood of the spin-3/2 atoms .",
    "it is noticeable that a threefold symmetry axis oriented perpendicular to the honeycomb layer prevents an appearance of biaxial crystal - field potential in a regular honeycomb lattice with a perfect arrangement of the oxalato groups , as well as magnetic metal atoms .",
    "however , a small lattice distortion which occurs rather frequently in the low - dimensional polymeric compounds due to the jahn - teller effect can potentially lower the local symmetry . in consequence of that",
    ", the distortion of lattice parameters can be regarded as a possible source of the biaxial crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "the most obvious example , where the lattice distortion removes the threefold symmetry axis represents the single - molecule magnet fe@xmath7 , in which three outer fe atoms occupy two non - equivalent positions around one central fe atom @xcite .",
    "let us turn our attention to the main points of the transformation method , which enables an exact treatment of the model system .",
    "firstly , it is very convenient to write the total hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) as a sum of site hamiltonians : @xmath43 where the each site hamiltonian @xmath44 involves all interaction terms associated with one spin-3/2 atom residing on the @xmath45th site of sublattice @xmath28 : @xmath46 e , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 . while the hamiltonians ( [ eq5 ] ) at different sites commute with respect to each other ( @xmath48 = 0 $ ] , for each @xmath49 ) , the partition function of the system can be partially factorized and consequently , rewritten in the form : @xmath50 .",

    "let us write the site hamiltonian ( [ eq5 ] ) in an usual matrix representation : @xmath57 in a standard basis of functions @xmath58 corresponding , respectively , to the four possible spin states @xmath59 of the @xmath45th atom from sublattice @xmath28 .",
    "although it is easy to find eigenvalues of the site hamiltonian ( [ eq7 ] ) , with respect to further calculation it is more favorable to obtain directly matrix elements of the expression @xmath60 $ ] .",

    "after substituting @xmath64 in the set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , the relevant trace @xmath56 $ ] can easily be calculated .",
    "moreover , its explicit form immediately implies a possibility of performing the standard star - triangle mapping transformation : @xmath65 =   2 \\exp[-5 \\beta d/4 - \\beta e_{k}/2 ] \\cosh \\bigl ( \\beta \\sqrt{(d + e_{k})^2 + 3 e^2 } \\bigr )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2 \\exp[-5 \\beta d/4 + \\beta e_{k}/2 ] \\cosh \\bigl ( \\beta \\sqrt{(d - e_{k})^2 + 3 e^2 } \\bigr ) = \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a~\\exp \\bigl [ \\beta r ( \\mu_{k1}^{z } \\mu_{k2}^{z } + \\mu_{k2}^{z } \\mu_{k3}^{z } + \\mu_{k3}^{z } \\mu_{k1}^{z } \\bigr ) \\bigr ] , \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which replaces the partition function of a _ star _ ( i.e. the four - spin cluster consisting of one central spin-3/2 atom and its three nearest - neighboring spin-1/2 atoms ) by the partition function of a _ triangle _ ( i.e. the three - spin cluster comprising of three outer spin-1/2 atoms in the corners of equilateral triangle ) , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . a physical meaning of the mapping ( [ eq9 ] ) is to remove all interaction parameters associated with the central spin-3/2 atom and to replace them by the effective interaction @xmath66 between the outer spin-1/2 atoms .",
    "it is noteworthy that both mapping parameters @xmath27 and @xmath66 are `` self - consistently '' given by the transformation equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , which must be valid for any combination of spin states of three spin-1/2 atoms .",
    "in consequence of that , the transformation parameters @xmath27 and @xmath66 can be expressed as : @xmath67 where the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are defined as follows : @xmath70    when the mapping ( [ eq9 ] ) is performed at each site of the sublattice @xmath28 , the original mixed - spin honeycomb lattice is mapped onto the spin-1/2 ising triangular lattice with the effective interaction @xmath66 given by the `` self - consistency '' condition ( [ eq10])-([eq11 ] ) . indeed , the substitution of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) into the partition function ( [ eq6 ] ) establishes the relationship : @xmath71 between the partition function @xmath72 of the mixed - spin honeycomb lattice and the partition function @xmath73 of the corresponding spin-1/2 triangular lattice . above equation constitutes the basic result of our calculation , since it enables relatively simple derivation of all required quantities , such as the magnetization , quadrupolar moment , correlation function , internal energy , specific heat , etc .",
    "in addition , by combining ( [ eq12 ] ) with ( [ eq9 ] ) one readily proves a validity of following exact spin identities : @xmath74}{\\mbox{tr}_{s_k } \\exp[- \\beta \\hat   { \\mathcal h}^{(k ) } ] } \\biggr \\rangle , \\label{eq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 represents the standard canonical average over the ensemble defined by the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath76 the one performed on the spin-1/2 ising triangular lattice with the effective exchange interaction @xmath66 . here",

    "one straightforwardly attains the following results : @xmath79 whereas the second spin identity ( [ eq13 ] ) enables after some algebra derivation of quantities depending on the spin variable from the sublattice @xmath28 : @xmath80 in above , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) labels the single - site magnetization of the sublattice @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath83 denotes the quadrupolar moment and finally , @xmath84 and @xmath85 stand , respectively , for the static pair and triplet correlation functions between the relevant spins of sublattice @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , the exact solution of both sublattice magnetization and quadrupolar moment require only a knowledge of the single - site magnetization @xmath86 , nearest - neighbour pair correlation function @xmath87 and triplet correlation function @xmath88 on the corresponding spin-1/2 ising triangular lattice unambiguously given by @xmath66 ( [ eq10])-([eq11 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , the appropriate exact solution of these quantities is well known , hence , one can directly utilize final results derived in refs .",

    "it should be noted here that exactly tractable models offer only seldom a possibility to investigate their spin dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the dynamical quantities such as autocorrelation and correlation functions are important also from the experimental point of view , because their magnitude directly determines a scattering cross section measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite , or a spin - lattice relaxation rate provided by a nuclear magnetic resonance technique @xcite .    as a starting point for calculation of the time - dependent autocorrelation function @xmath93 can , for convenience , serve the exact spin identity ( [ eq13 ] ) : @xmath94 \\exp[- \\beta \\hat { \\mathcal h}^{(k ) } ] \\ } }       { \\mbox{tr}_{s_k } \\exp[- \\beta \\hat { \\mathcal h}^{(k ) } ] } \\biggr \\rangle , \\label{eq16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symmetrized form in the definition of @xmath93 is used to construct a hermitian operator , @xmath95 represents the heisenberg picture for the time - dependent operator @xmath96 , @xmath97 stands for the reduced planck s constant and @xmath98 .",

    "before proceeding to a discussion of the most interesting results , it is noticeable that the results derived in the previous section are rather general , since they are valid for a ferromagnetic ( @xmath104 ) as well as ferrimagnetic ( @xmath105 ) version of the model under investigation . in what follows , we shall restrict our analysis to the ferrimagnetic model only , since the polymeric compounds from the family of oxalates @xcite fall mostly into the class of ferrimagnets .",
    "nevertheless , it appears worthwhile to remark that a magnetic behavior of the ferrimagnetic system completely resembles the one of ferromagnetic system .",
    "finally , one should also emphasize that the mapping ( [ eq9 ] ) remains invariant under the transformation @xmath106 .",

    "first , we will take a closer look at the ground - state behaviour . taking into account the zero - temperature limit ( @xmath109 ) ,",

    "it should be mentioned that by neglecting the biaxial anisotropy , i.e. by putting @xmath115 into the phase boundary condition ( [ eq175 ] ) , one recovers the boundary uniaxial anisotropy @xmath116 in accordance with the results reported by gonalves @xcite several years ago . moreover",
    ", the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase corresponds in this limit to the simple ferrimagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) phase with both sublattice magnetization oriented antiparallel with respect to each other : @xmath117 , @xmath118 in the op@xmath2 and respectively , @xmath117 , @xmath119 in the op@xmath3 .",
    "apparently , the spin-3/2 atoms occupy exclusively the @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) state in the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase when @xmath39 is satisfied .",
    "the situation becomes much more complex by turning on the biaxial anisotropy . even though the sublattice magnetization @xmath81 remains in the ground - state at its saturation value in both op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 phases , the sublattice magnetization @xmath82 is gradually suppressed by the effect of biaxial anisotropy ( see fig .",
    "it is quite obvious from this figure that the biaxial anisotropy gradually destroys the perfect ferrimagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) spin arrangement , which occurs in the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase in the limit of vanishing @xmath9 .",
    "let us find a primary occasion for this unexpected behavior accompanied by a spin reduction at sublattice @xmath28 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , one finds @xmath122 to be valid in the whole parameter space corresponding to the op@xmath2 . from an elementary consideration",
    "it can be easily understood that the spin-3/2 atoms must occupy in the op@xmath2 phase either the @xmath123 or @xmath124 state in order to satisfy simultaneously both values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the ground state .",
    "aforementioned argument is also supported by the fact that the @xmath9-term does not couple in the hamiltonian ( [ eq7 ] ) the @xmath123 and @xmath124 states with the @xmath125 and @xmath126 ones .",
    "hence , the @xmath123 and @xmath124 states are in the op@xmath2 phase the only _ allowable _ states , while the @xmath125 and @xmath126 states are , on the contrary , the _ forbidden _ ones . the observed spin reduction at sublattice @xmath28 can be thus attributed to the local quantum fluctuations induced by the biaxial anisotropy , which in turn lead to a spin tunneling between the @xmath123 and @xmath124 states in the op@xmath2 . although the occupation of the minority @xmath124 state rises steadily with increasing the biaxial anisotropy strength , it is noticeable that the @xmath123 state still remains the state with the most probable occupation . for completeness",
    ", it should be pointed out that in accord with our expectation the negative uniaxial anisotropy ( @xmath127 ) reduces the occupation of the minority @xmath124 state , while the positive one ( @xmath128 ) favors it .",
    "quite similar situation emerges also in the op@xmath3 phase .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to remark that the op@xmath3 phase appears in the region of strong uniaxial anisotropies @xmath129 only . due to a strong positive uniaxial anisotropy",
    ", the spin-3/2 atoms undergo a well - known spin transition from the @xmath123 to @xmath125 state , which macroscopically manifests itself in the phase transition from the op@xmath2 to op@xmath3 phase . as stated before , the biaxial anisotropy couples together the @xmath125 and @xmath126 states and therefore , the tunneling between these spin states should be expected to occur in the op@xmath3 . the analytical solution for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( [ eq19 ] ) , as well as a validity of the relation @xmath130 in a whole parameter space corresponding to the op@xmath3 phase , indeed confirm this suggestion .",
    "however , the negative ( positive ) uniaxial anisotropy prefers ( reduces ) the occupation of minority @xmath131 state in the op@xmath3 phase in contrast to the abovementioned trends observed in the op@xmath2 phase .",
    "now , let us step forward to the discussion of the time dependent autocorrelation function ( [ eq17 ] ) . among other matters , this quantity can serve in evidence whether the spin-3/2 atoms fluctuate in the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase between their _ allowable _ @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 and @xmath131 ) spin states .",

    "since @xmath93 evidently varies in time , it clearly demonstrates the zero - temperature spin dynamics between the _ allowable _ states .",
    "moreover , a detailed analysis reveals that @xmath93 is in the zero - temperature limit a harmonic function of time and whence , the time dependence can be characterized by an angular frequency @xmath136 depending on whether the system resides the op@xmath2 , or op@xmath3 phase .",
    "this result is taken to mean that the spin system necessarily recovers after some characteristic recurrence time ( @xmath137 ) its initial state .",
    "more specifically , fig .",
    "3a illustrates the time variation of @xmath93 in the op@xmath2 phase , because with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq175 ] ) one never approaches the op@xmath3 phase for @xmath138 .",
    "3a clearly clarifies the role of biaxial anisotropy : the stronger the biaxial anisotropy @xmath139 , the greater the angular frequency of spin tunneling and in the consequence of that , the shorter the appropriate recurrence time .",
    "furthermore , the increasing strength of the biaxial anisotropy enhances also the amplitude of oscillation in the time - dependence of @xmath93 .",
    "this observation would suggest that the increase of biaxial anisotropy enhances a number of the spin-3/2 atoms tunneling during the recurrence time between the @xmath123 and @xmath124 states in the op@xmath2 phase .",
    "however , since the equilibrium magnetization does not change in time , the number of atoms that tunnel from @xmath140 to @xmath141 state must definitely be the same as those that tunnel from the @xmath141 to @xmath140 state .    to illustrate the effect of uniaxial anisotropy , the time variation of @xmath93",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "3b for @xmath142 and several values of @xmath143 .",
    "apparently , the @xmath93 oscillates for strong negative ( positive ) uniaxial constants @xmath143 in the vicinity of boundary values @xmath144 .",
    "these values clearly demonstrate that the prevailing number of spin-3/2 atoms occupy in the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase the @xmath140 ( @xmath145 ) state , since @xmath146 when @xmath147 .",
    "moreover , the stronger the uniaxial anisotropy ( independently of its sign ) , the smaller the relevant amplitudes of oscillation , i.e. the smaller the number of tunneling atoms during the recurrence time . on the other hand",
    ", the increasing strength of uniaxial anisotropy enhances the angular frequency of oscillation , what means , that the tunneling atoms return from the minority @xmath141 ( @xmath148 ) state to the most probable occupied @xmath140 ( @xmath145 ) state of the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase after a shorter recurrence time .      in this part",
    ", we would like to comment on the finite - temperature behaviour of the system under investigation .",
    "let us begin by considering the effect of uniaxial and biaxial single - ion anisotropies on the critical behaviour .",
    "for this purpose , two typical finite - temperature phase diagrams are illustrated in fig .",
    "4a and 4b . in both figures ,",
    "the op@xmath2 ( op@xmath3 ) phase can be located below the phase boundaries depicted as solid ( dashed ) lines , while above these boundary lines the usual paramagnetic phase becomes stable .",
    "further , open circles represent special critical points at which both op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 phases coexist .",
    "actually , we have not found any phase transition between the op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 phases at non - zero temperatures , what indicates that the op@xmath2 phase coexists with the op@xmath3 one at non - zero temperatures merely for the same @xmath149 values as in the ground state ( [ eq175 ] ) .",
    "finally , a closer mathematical analysis reveals that both temperature - driven phase transitions which are related to the op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 phase , respectively , are of a second order and belong to a standard ising universality class .",
    "4a shows the critical temperature ( @xmath150 ) as a function of the uniaxial anisotropy for several values of the biaxial anisotropy . the critical temperature versus",
    "uniaxial anisotropy dependence is quite obvious for @xmath115 , when increasing @xmath143 , @xmath150 monotonically decreases .",
    "hence , the critical temperature approaches in the limit @xmath151 its minimum ( maximum ) value @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) in agreement with the exact @xmath150 ( triple @xmath150 ) of the spin-1/2 ising honeycomb lattice .",
    "a gradual decline of the transition temperature can obviously be explained as a consequence of the fact , that the positive uniaxial anisotropy energetically favors the low - spin @xmath154 states before the high - spin @xmath155 ones .",
    "the most interesting finding to emerge here is that the biaxial anisotropy may significantly modify the critical behavior of the studied system . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath150 firstly reaches its local minimum at certain positive @xmath143 and then rises steadily to its limiting value @xmath152 .",
    "the extraordinary increase of @xmath150 in the region @xmath156 can be explained through a suppression of the occupation of minority @xmath148 state , which appears in the op@xmath3 phase due to the uniaxial anisotropy effect . in accordance with previous assumption , the greater the biaxial anisotropy ( i.e. the greater a number of atoms that occupy the minority @xmath148 state ) , the more impressive increase of @xmath150 can be observed .",
    "in addition , it is easy to understand from here that the biaxial anisotropy substantially lowers the critical temperature of op@xmath2 phase in the @xmath157 region , in that it is responsible for the quantum spin tunneling between the @xmath140 and @xmath141 states .    to illustrate the influence of biaxial anisotropy on the criticality",
    ", the dependence of transition temperature on the biaxial anisotropy is shown in fig .",
    "4b for several values of the uniaxial anisotropy @xmath143 .",
    "as one would expect , @xmath150 gradually decreases with increasing the biaxial anisotropy for any @xmath158 .",
    "it is quite obvious that the appropriate suppression of @xmath150 can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations , which become the stronger , the greater the ratio @xmath139 .",
    "apart from this rather trivial finding , one also observes here the peculiar dependences with the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath150 .",
    "the critical temperature may exhibit only a slight variation with increasing @xmath139 ( as it is in the case of @xmath114 ) , or it may show unexpected local minima , as it is in the case of @xmath159 and @xmath160 . since the local minima can be located very near to the coexistence point of the op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 phases ( depicted as open circles ) , the relevant increase of @xmath150 can be related to the op@xmath3 @xmath161 op@xmath2 phase transition . namely , the most populated @xmath145 spin state in the op@xmath3 is replaced after this phase transition by the @xmath140 state , which is the most occupied spin state in the op@xmath2 .",
    "the spin crossover from the low - spin @xmath145 to the high - spin @xmath140 state must lead , of course , to a slight increase of @xmath150 .    at this stage , let us provide an independent check of the critical behavior by studying thermal dependences of magnetization .",
    "the single - site magnetization is plotted against temperature in fig .",
    "5 for the biaxial anisotropy @xmath142 and several values of the uniaxial anisotropy @xmath143 . fig .",
    "5a shows a typical situation observed in the op@xmath2 phase : the more positive the uniaxial crystal - field potential @xmath143 , the stronger the spin reduction ( the lower the magnetization @xmath82 ) due to the @xmath162 spin tunneling . in consequence of that , the total magnetization alters from a standard q - type dependence observed for @xmath163 ( see for instance the curves for @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) to a more interesting r - type dependence , which occurs for positive uniaxial anisotropies ( @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) .",
    "unusual slope in the thermal dependence of total magnetization can be related to a more rapid thermal variation of @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , on account of the quantum fluctuations @xmath82 is thermally easier disturbed than @xmath81 which , on the contrary , always exhibits the standard q - type behavior ( spin-1/2 atoms are not directly affected by the biaxial crystal - field potential @xmath9 ) .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "5b shows how the situation changes by considering the transition toward the op@xmath3 phase .",
    "actually , both magnetically ordered phases op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 have the same internal energy ( coexist together ) at @xmath168 when @xmath142 , while the op@xmath3 phase becomes more stable if @xmath169 .",
    "accordingly , fig .",
    "4b displays the thermal variation of sublattice magnetization exactly at the op@xmath2-op@xmath3 phase boundary and in the op@xmath3 phase ( @xmath114 and @xmath170 ) .",
    "the corresponding thermal dependences of total magnetization are plotted in the insert of fig .",
    "as it is apparent from these figures , the initial value of @xmath82 is suppressed from its saturation value ( @xmath119 ) owing to a presence of the minority @xmath171 state .",
    "nevertheless , a large number of spins can be thermally excited to the @xmath140 state for @xmath143 from the vicinity of op@xmath2-op@xmath3 phase boundary and hence , @xmath82 rapidly increases upon heating ( see the curve for @xmath114 ) . as a result of this thermal excitation , the total magnetization exhibits n - type dependence with one compensation point in which @xmath81 and @xmath82 completely cancel out ( see the insert in fig .",
    "5b ) . finally , even for stronger uniaxial anisotropies ( e.g. @xmath172 ) the total magnetization recovers the q - shape , since the thermal fluctuation prefer excitations to the @xmath133 state rather than to the @xmath140 one . such a thermal excitations must , naturally , lower the sublattice magnetization @xmath82 .    to conclude our discussion devoted to finite - temperature properties ,",
    "let us proceed to the time variation of dynamical autocorrelation function @xmath93 as depicted in fig . 6 for @xmath142 and three selected values of @xmath143 . in order to enable a comparison between the displayed data at various @xmath143 , the relevant temperatures are normalized with respect to their appropriate critical temperatures , i.e. we have defined the dimensionless temperature @xmath173 that measures a difference from the critical point ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the time variations of @xmath93 from fig .",
    "6a and 6b display the relevant changes of dynamical autocorrelation function in the op@xmath2 phase , while fig .",
    "6c shows the corresponding dependences in the op@xmath3 phase .",
    "it can be easily understood that @xmath93 is not in general the time - periodic function at non - zero temperatures no matter whether considering @xmath93 in the op@xmath2 , or op@xmath3 phase .",
    "in fact , @xmath93 arises according to eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) as a superposition of two harmonic oscillations with two different angular frequencies @xmath175 and also various amplitudes . the interference between these harmonic oscillations gives rise to a rather complex time variation of @xmath93 , which is in general aperiodic , displaying nodes and other typical interference effects .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath93 at non - zero temperatures is maintained only for some particular @xmath176 values , which retain the ratio @xmath177 to be rational , while in any other case , @xmath93 behaves aperiodically .",
    "the dependences drawn in fig .",
    "6 nicely illustrate also the temperature effect on the spin dynamics .",
    "it follows from these dependences that some amplitudes are suppressed as the temperature increases , while another ones become more robust .",
    "obviously , in the high - temperature regime that amplitudes become dominant , which coincide to the oscillation with lower angular frequency .",
    "contrary to this , the amplitudes arising from higher frequency oscillation dominate in the low - temperature regime .",
    "the most miscellaneous time variation of @xmath93 thus emerges in the vicinity of critical temperature ( @xmath178 ) , which represents an intermediate temperature range between the low- and high - temperature regime .",
    "however , a rather exceptional case is displayed in fig .",
    "6c , where the most miscellaneous dependence appears surprisingly at substantially lower temperature ( @xmath179 ) rather than the critical one ( @xmath174 ) . when looking back to the thermal variation of magnetization depicted in fig .",
    "5b , one finds a feasible explanation for this striking behavior .",
    "it turns out that the temperature ( @xmath180 ) of the most miscellaneous time variation of @xmath93 coincides with the temperature @xmath181 , at which the most robust spin excitation to the @xmath140 can be observed .",
    "in addition to the _ allowable _ @xmath121 and @xmath126 states , a large number of the spin-3/2 atoms is therefore thermally excited to the @xmath120 spin state . this observation would suggest that the thermal excitations can basically modify the spin dynamics as well .",
    "in this article , the exact solution of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 ising model on honeycomb lattice is presented and discussed in detail .",
    "the particular attention has been focused on the effect of uniaxial and biaxial crystal - field anisotropies acting on the spin-3/2 atoms .",
    "as it has been shown , a presence of the biaxial anisotropy significantly modifies the magnetic behavior of the system under investigation .",
    "it turns out that already a small amount of the biaxial anisotropy raises a non - trivial spin dynamics and basically influences the thermodynamic properties , as well .",
    "the most striking finding to emerge here constitutes an exact evidence of the spin tunneling between the @xmath155 and @xmath182 states in two different magnetically ordered phases op@xmath2 and op@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "macroscopically , the tunneling effect decreases the critical temperature of the magnetically ordered phases and appreciably suppresses the magnetization of spin-3/2 sublattice .",
    "this quantum reduction appears apparently due to the local quantum fluctuations arising from the biaxial crystal - field potential .",
    "there is an interesting correspondence between the model described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) and a similar model with a local transverse magnetic field @xmath183 acting on the spin-3/2 atoms only @xcite .",
    "however , similarity in their actual properties is not accidental , in fact , when neglecting the uniaxial crystal - field potential @xmath8 in hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , an effective mapping @xmath184 ensures the equivalence between both the models .",
    "since this mapping is not related to the magnetic structure in any fashion , the appropriate correspondence can be extended to the several lattice models .",
    "it is therefore valuable to mention that magnetic properties of the models with a local transverse field become a subject matter of many theoretical works @xcite .",
    "apparently , the magnetic behavior of these systems should completely resemble that one of their counterparts with the biaxial crystal - field potential .",
    "finally , let us turn back to the origin of biaxial anisotropy .",
    "uprise of this anisotropy term in the mixed - spin honeycomb lattice is , namely , closely associated with at least a small lattice distortion .",
    "to simplify the situation , the proposed hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) accounts for the biaxial crystal - field anisotropy , while a difference between exchange interactions in the different spatial directions has been for simplicity omitted .",
    "nevertheless , the developed procedure can be rather straightforwardly generalized to an anisotropic model accounting for the different interactions along various spatial directions .",
    "moreover , the biaxial anisotropy can be even considered as an arbitrary function ( linear , quadratic , exponential , logarithmic , ... ) of the ratio between appropriate interaction parameters .",
    "hence , it would be very interesting to find out whether such a system is instable toward the spontaneous lattice distortion caused by the spin - peierls phenomenon . in this direction",
    "continues our next work .",
