    "the success of our hybrid approach depends critically on managing two processes : limiting majorana loss in the quadrupole trap and effective adiabatic ( approximately constant entropy ) transfer from the quadrupole trap to the harmonic dipole trap .",
    "majorana loss is particularly detrimental , as it causes both loss and heating .",
    "such loss can be difficult to describe accurately , but a simple argument  @xcite leads to the estimate that the majorana loss rate @xmath66 scales as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the radial half width half maximum cloud size in the quadrupole trap . using the proportionality constant measured in  @xcite , we can estimate @xmath69 where we have ignored gravity .",
    "this estimate is independent of the elastic collision rate in the trap since it assumes thermal equilibrium , an invalid assumption at low densities or large loss rates .",

    "near this temperature fast evaporation ( high elastic collision rate ) is advantageous .",
    "this loss rate can be mediated somewhat by adiabatically expanding the trap , since the temperature scales more weakly than the field gradient at constant entropy , @xmath71 , and weakening the trap will decrease the loss rate , at the expense of a lower collisional rate .",
    "the adiabatic transfer is more subtle than a mere expansion of the trap volume , since in addition to expanding the trap , the shape of the trap is modified .",
    "this leads to changes in phase - space density , even at constant entropy  @xcite , an effect used to obtain a bec of cesium from a very cold , but dilute gas  @xcite . in our case ,",

    "the adiabatic expansion and transfer is similar to forced evaporation , except that here the",

    "as with evaporation , there is in principle no upper bound on the efficiency of the process  @xcite , so that nearly all the atoms could be cooled in the dipole trap from any initial temperature .",
    "this would take nearly infinite time , however , and in practice the actual process depends on the details of the loss mechanisms and the elastic collision rates throughout the trap .",

    "<S> we collect atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and then capture the atom in a magnetic quadrupole trap and force rf evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> we then transfer the resulting cold , dense cloud into a spatially mode - matched optical dipole trap by lowering the quadrupole field gradient to below gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this technique combines the efficient capture of atoms from a mot into a magnetic trap with the rapid evaporation of optical dipole traps ; the approach is insensitive to the peak quadrupole gradient and the precise trapping beam waist . </S>",
    "<S> our system reliably produces a condensate with @xmath1 atoms every @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> a range of techniques have been developed to produce quantum degenerate gases , of varying degrees of complexity and difficulty . </S>",
    "<S> almost all current methods rely on the same basic approach : laser cooling of atoms  , followed by evaporative cooling in a conservative trap  @xcite . when designing there are many often competing considerations : reliability , speed , simplicity , large optical access , and reasonably large number . </S>",
    "<S> we describe here a simple approach that quickly produces a relatively large bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0 atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic quadrupole traps for neutral atoms  @xcite have several strengths . </S>",
    "<S> they have large trap volumes , which can be well matched to the size of laser cooled atom clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the effectively linear potential provides tight confinement , allowing for efficient evaporative cooling , and the quadrupole field can be generated from a simple arrangement of two electromagnetic coils which allows for good optical access to the sample . the quadrupole trap </S>",
    "<S> s one major drawback is majorana spin - flip losses and the resulting heating near the zero - field point at the center of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> this limits forced evaporative cooling to relatively low phase - space densities  @xcite . still , the first two dilute - gas bec s were produced in traps derived from the simple quadrupole trap , taking advantage of its strengths by avoiding the majorana losses in two different ways : by providing a time - orbiting bias field ( `` top '' trap ) to shift the zero away from the atom cloud  @xcite , or by using a repulsive optical potential ( i.e. , an optical plug ) to push the atoms away from the zero  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the top trap is still widely used , and the optically plugged trap has successfully been revisited  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> far detuned optical dipole traps have a different set of strengths . </S>",
    "<S> they can be spin - state independent , made in flexible geometries that provide good optical access , have tight confinement and efficient evaporation , and they do nt require magnetic coils . </S>",
    "<S> one drawback is that simultaneously deep and large - volume traps require prohibitively large laser power . </S>",
    "<S> one must carefully `` mode match '' the laser - cooled atoms to the optical dipole trap , and all - optical approaches tend to produce relatively small bec s  @xcite . by loading into large - volume , shallow traps and transferring into smaller volume traps  @xcite , larger bec s can be made  @xcite , but this requires superlative high - density laser cooling . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that bec s could be efficiently produced using a quadrupole trap as a reservoir to directly feed a red - detuned dipole trap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate here such a hybrid technique which combines the advantages of quadrupole and optical traps while avoiding their individual weaknesses . </S>",
    "<S> we can then load the bec from the hybrid trap into an all - optical dipole trap without an additional blue - detuned optical plug .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic approach is to load laser cooled atoms into a quadrupole trap , and use forced rf evaporation  @xcite to reduce the phase space density until majorana spin - flips cause significant loss and heating . </S>",
    "<S> we then transfer atoms from the quadrupole trap to a single - beam optical dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> this step can be fairly efficient , transferring a large fraction of the atoms from the quadrupole trap into the optical trap . to limit majorana losses during and after the transfer </S>",
    "<S> , the center of the optical trap is offset by roughly a beam waist from the field zero of the magnetic trap . </S>",
    "<S> further , offset quadrupole field provides harmonic confinement along the beam direction ; this approach therefore yields 3d confinement without a crossed dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> since the atom cloud is adiabatically cooled during the transfer , only a relatively small optical trap depth ( @xmath3  @xmath4k in our case ) is required . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the trap shape during the adiabatic transfer , from linear quadrupole to harmonic , modifies the density of states in such a way as to increase the phase space density at constant entropy , leading to fairly high initial phase space density in the dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> forced evaporative cooling by lowering the optical trap power  @xcite then leads to quantum degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is simple , flexible and allows for significant optical access . </S>",
    "<S> we reliably produce @xmath5rb bec s with @xmath6 atoms in a time @xmath7 . </S>"
