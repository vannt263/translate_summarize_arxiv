    "in recent years , studies of charmonium and open - charm systems have witnessed a renaissance .",
    "this was mainly led by the experimental discoveries of various new particles , either the still largely mysterious @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 particles or the new open - charm states .",
    "many of these states can not be easily understood in conventional quark models without introducing new degrees of freedom in addition to their basic @xmath4 structure , notably multi - quark components , i.e. @xmath5 .    an interesting resonance in this context is the @xmath6 with a mass of @xmath7 mev and a small width of several mev ( @xmath8 mev )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 was first observed by the babar collaboration in the inclusive @xmath9 invariant mass distribution from @xmath10 annihilation data at energies near 10.6 gev  @xcite and later confirmed by belle  @xcite and cleo  @xcite .",
    "the nature of this state has been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "all studies seem to agree that the coupling of the @xmath6 to the nearby @xmath11 threshold can not be ignored . from this perspective",
    ", it is particularly interesting to note that the @xmath6 can be `` dynamically '' generated in coupled - channel unitary approaches with interaction kernels provided by either chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath12pt )  @xcite or a su(4 ) lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "such approaches have provided many interesting results in the past few years , e.g. , in explaining the nature of some low - lying hadronic states such as the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 ( for a comprehensive list of references , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this dynamical picture of the @xmath6 ,",
    "the interactions of @xmath11 and coupled channels play a decisive role . a quantity that characterizes the strength of such an interaction at low energies is the scattering length .",
    "although it can not measured directly given the short life time of the @xmath0 mesons , it can nevertheless be studied on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-wave @xmath11 scattering lengths have recently been computed by several authors  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculation was performed using a covariant formulation of @xmath12pt up to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) and its unitarized version .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculation was performed using the heavy - meson @xmath12pt ( hm@xmath12pt )  @xcite in the heavy quark limit up to next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) order , where recoil effects have been neglected .",
    "the authors cautioned , however , that since the @xmath0 mesons are not heavy enough , recoil corrections may not be small and have to be studied .",
    "to our knowledge , recoil corrections have so far not been systematically studied in @xmath12pt describing the interactions between heavy - light mesons and nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "they have been , however , studied quite extensively in the one - baryon sector with three flavors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath15 .",
    "there these corrections were found to be fairly large and play an important role in the studies of many physical observables  @xcite .",
    "because of the large baryon mass that does not vanish in the chiral limit , covariant baryon @xmath12pt often faces the so - called power - counting - breaking ( pcb ) problem  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been traditionally dealt with using a dual expansion in terms of both @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a generic small quantity , @xmath21 the baryon mass and @xmath22 the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "this is the celebrated heavy baryon @xmath12pt  @xcite .",
    "though very successful in describing many observables , this approach is not covariant and modifies the analyticity of loop amplitudes .",
    "more importantly , from a practical point of view it suffers from slow convergence , particularly in the 3-flavor sector . to overcome these problems , several other approaches to deal with the pcb problem",
    "have been proposed , which among others include the infrared ( ir )  @xcite and extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms )  @xcite renormalization schemes . while the ir scheme was found to introduce artificial cuts in certain cases ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the eoms approach is fully covariant and conserves the analytical properties of loop amplitudes . in a series of applications  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the eoms approach also improves the convergence behavior of su(3 ) baryon @xmath12pt .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to study the scattering lengths of nambu - goldstone bosons ( @xmath23 ) interacting with @xmath0 mesons in a covariant formulation of @xmath12pt by using the eoms scheme to remove the pcb terms induced by the large @xmath0 meson masses .",
    "given the fact that the @xmath0 meson mass ( @xmath24 gev ) is much larger than the nucleon mass , it is anticipated that the recoil corrections should be smaller than those in the nucleon case . nevertheless",
    ", such recoil corrections may still be sizable as we will show in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the relevant effective lagrangians and explain briefly the eoms renormalization scheme . in section iii , we show the numerical results , compare them with those of earlier studies by paying special attention to the recoil corrections , followed by a short summary in section iv .",
    "in this section we introduce the chiral lagrangians relevant to the present study up to nnlo and explain briefly the eoms renormalization scheme used to remove the pcb pieces appearing in the covariant loop calculation .      to introduce the chiral effective lagrangians , one must specify a power counting rule . in the present case the light meson masses @xmath25 and the field gradients @xmath26",
    "are counted as @xmath27 , while @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are counted as @xmath32 , where @xmath23 denotes the nambu - goldstone bosons , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath0 and @xmath35 meson fields .",
    "the nambu - goldstone boson propagator,@xmath36 , is counted as @xmath37 , while the heavy - light pseudoscalar and vector meson propagators , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are counted as @xmath40 .",
    "the leading order chiral lagrangian describing the self - interaction of nambu - goldstone bosons has the standard form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 collects the pseudoscalar octet fields @xmath43 @xmath44 is the mass matrix , and @xmath45 is the pseudoscalar decay constant in the chiral limit . here and in the following , @xmath46 always denotes the trace in the respective flavor space .",
    "the lowest order chiral lagrangian for the heavy - light pseudoscalar and vector mesons is   @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) the su(3 ) flavor index , @xmath52 is the heavy - light pseudoscalar - vector coupling constant of dimension 1 and @xmath53 is the mass of the heavy - light meson in the chiral limit .",
    "the vector and axial - vector currents , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are defined as @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath52 can be fixed by reproducing the @xmath58 decay width . using the pdg average , @xmath59 kev and @xmath60  @xcite , one obtains @xmath61 kev and accordingly @xmath62 .",
    "the nlo lagrangian relevant to our study is   mesons in nlo and nnlo lagrangians do not contribute to the nnlo @xmath63 scattering lengths and therefore will not be explicitly shown in this work . ]",
    "@xmath64,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 .",
    "here we have adopted a convention consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite for the purpose of later comparison .",
    "in general , there are more terms contributing to @xmath66 scattering , e.g. , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 . however , at @xmath66 threshold , it can be easily shown that these terms lead to the same structure as those proportional to @xmath70 and @xmath71 and therefore can be neglected .",
    "the low - energy - constant ( lec ) @xmath72 can be determined from the mass splitting between strange and non - strange heavy - light mesons within the same doublet , i.e. , @xmath73 using the masses given in table  [ table : par ] , we obtain @xmath74 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it should be pointed out that since we have neglected all the nnlo counter - term contributions , we are not in a position to comment on the convergence behavior of either the covariant or the hm@xmath12pt results . furthermore , because of the nearby resonance @xmath6 , a pure @xmath12pt calculation , such as ours , in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 channels should be taken with care , where coupled - channel unitarity may play an important role ( for a relevant discussion , see ref .",
    "we have studied the scattering lengths of nambu - goldstone bosons interacting with @xmath0 mesons using a covariant formulation of @xmath12pt . in particular , we have studied the recoil corrections by comparing the relativistic with the non - relativistic results .",
    "our studies show that the recoil corrections are sizable , which should be kept in mind in future studies and in using the hm@xmath12pt results . based on available information",
    "we can not conclude which framework is better , although in principle one should trust more covariant results , particularly when recoil corrections are large .    up to now",
    ", @xmath12pt describing the interactions between heavy - light mesons and nambu - goldstone bosons has often been used in the non - relativistic limit . with more precise data and lattice qcd results becoming available , one may have to study more carefully the effects of recoil corrections .",
    "the present work should be seen as a first step in this direction .",
    "this work was supported in part by the alexander von humboldt foundation and the fundamental research funds for the central universities ( china ) .",
