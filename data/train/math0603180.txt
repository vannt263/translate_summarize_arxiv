    "the littlewood - richardson numbers @xmath2 for partitions @xmath3 are important in many areas of mathematics . for example , they are the structure constants of several related rings with distinguished bases : the ring of symmetric functions with its basis of schur functions , the representation ring of @xmath4 with its basis of irreducible highest weight modules , the external representation ring of the tower of symmetric groups with its basis of irreducible modules , and the cohomology ring of the grassmannian with its basis of schubert classes  @xcite .",
    "the combinatorics of littlewood - richardson numbers are extremely interesting and now we have many formulas for them , including the original littlewood - richardson formula  @xcite . despite this deep and prolonged interest in littlewood - richardson numbers ,",
    "one of the most fundamental questions about them was not asked until about a decade ago : @xmath5    this question came from ( of all places ) a problem in linear algebra concerning the possible eigenvalues of a sum of hermitian matrices .",
    "the answer to this problem is given by the horn inequalities : the eigenvalues which can and do occur are the solutions to a set of linear inequalities , and the inequalities themselves come from non - negative integral eigenvalues solving this problem for smaller matrices .",
    "the same inequalities answer our question about littlewood - richardson numbers .",
    "a littlewood - richardson number @xmath2 is non - zero if and only if the triple of partitions @xmath6 satisfy certain linear inequalities , and the inequalities themselves come from triples indexing smaller non - zero littlewood - richardson coefficients .",
    "this description is a consequence of work of klyachko  @xcite which linked eigenvalues of sums of hermitian matrices , highest weight modules of @xmath4 , and the schubert calculus for grassmannians , and then knutson and tao s proof  @xcite of zelevinsky s saturation conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this work implies horn s conjecture  @xcite about the eigenvalues of sums of hermitian matrices .",
    "these results have wide implications in mathematics ( see the surveys  @xcite ) and have raised many new and evocative questions .",
    "for example , the horn inequalities give the answer to questions in several different realms of mathematics ( representation theory , combinatorics , schubert calculus , eigenvalues ) , but it was initially mysterious why any one of these questions should have a recursive answer , as the proofs travelled through so many other parts of mathematics .",
    "another question , which was the _ point de dpart _ for the results we describe here , is the following : are there related numbers whose non - vanishing has a similar recursive answer ?",
    "our main result is a recursive answer for the non - vanishing of the analogs of littlewood - richardson coefficients for schur @xmath0-functions , and the same for schur @xmath1-functions .",
    "we give one set of inequalities which determine non - vanishing for the @xmath0-functions and a different set of inequalities for the @xmath1-functions . because each schur @xmath0-function is a non - zero multiple of a corresponding schur @xmath1-function , a littlewood - richardson number for @xmath0-functions is non - zero if and only if the corresponding number for @xmath1-functions is non - zero , and thus our two sets of inequalities have the same sets of solutions .",
    "another consequence of our work is a new set of recursive horn - type inequalities for the ordinary littlewood - richardson numbers @xmath2 . while these new inequalities are clearly related to the ordinary horn inequalities , they are definitely quite different .",
    "( we explain this below . )    before we define some of these objects and give the different recursions , we remark that our results were proved using a mixture of the combinatorics of root systems , combinatorial linear algebra in lie algebras , and the geometry of certain flag varieties @xmath7 .",
    "cominuscule flag varieties are ( almost all of ) the flag varieties whose geometrically defined bruhat order ( which is the bruhat order on the cosets @xmath8 of the weyl groups ) is a distributive lattice .",
    "the alert reader will notice that these inequalities for schur @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions are not strictly recursive because they are indexed by ordinary littlewood - richardson numbers which are non - zero .",
    "the reason for the term recursive is that the inequalities stem from a geometric recursion among all cominuscule flag varieties which is not evident from viewing only the subclass corresponding to , say the schur @xmath1-functions .",
    "this abstract does not dwell on the geometry , but rather on the fascinating combinatorial consequences of these recursions .",
    "the last section of this extended abstract does however give a broad view of some of the key geometric ideas which underly our recursion .",
    "the results here are proved in the forthcoming preprint by the authors , `` the recursive nature of the cominuscule schubert calculus '' .",
    "for more details and definitions concerning the various flavors of schur functions that arise here , we recommend the book of macdonald  @xcite .",
    "are symmetric functions indexed by , which are weakly decreasing sequences of nonnegative integers , @xmath9 .",
    "the schur function @xmath10 is homogeneous of degree @xmath11 .",
    "schur functions form a basis for the @xmath12-algebra of symmetric functions .",
    "thus there are integral numbers @xmath2 defined by the identity @xmath13 homogeneity gives the necessary relation @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "a partition @xmath16 is represented by its , which is a left - justified array of boxes in the positive quadrant with @xmath17 boxes in row @xmath18 .",

    "since replacing a partition @xmath16 by its conjugate @xmath51 ( interchanging rows with columns ) induces an involution on the algebra of symmetric functions , there is a version of the horn recursion where one crosses out columns instead of rows .",

    "conversely , if a structure constant is zero , then any corresponding general intersection is empty , and a non - empty intersection is never transverse .",
    "the key idea is to replace the difficult question on non - emptiness of a general intersection of schubert varieties by the easier question of the transversality of a ( not completely general ) intersection .",
    "this was used by one of us to show transversality of intersections in the grassmannian of lines  @xcite , but its use to study the horn problem is due to belkale  @xcite , who first gave a geometric proof of the horn recursion for the grassmannian .",
