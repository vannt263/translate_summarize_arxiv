    "markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) is a bl lacertae object ( bl lac ) at @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) making it the second closest known bl lac after mrk 421 .",
    "mrk 501 was discovered as a @xmath1-ray source at @xmath5 300 gev by the whipple collaboration ( @xcite ) and recently confirmed by the hegra collaboration ( @xcite ) .",
    "its initial detection level was 8% of the vhe flux from the crab nebula . like the other tev - emitting agn , mrk 421 , mrk 501 exhibits day - scale variability in its vhe @xmath1-ray emission ( @xcite ) , but prior to 1997",
    ", the @xmath1-ray emission from mrk 421 was generally observed to have a higher mean flux ( @xcite ) , to be more frequently variable ( @xcite ) , and exhibit higher amplitude and shorter time - scale flares ( @xcite ) .",
    "egret has never detected mrk 501 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its low vhe flux and the nearby egret source , 4c  38.41 ( @xcite ) , were previously assumed to account for this .    here , we present whipple observatory vhe @xmath1-ray and optical , osse , and egret observations of mrk 501 during a flare in 1997 april .",
    "we also include quicklook x - ray results from the asm .",
    "overlapping observations of mrk 501 with _ rxte _ ( @xcite ) and _ beppo sax _ ( @xcite ) are reported elsewhere .",
    "details of the observations are given in ",
    "2 . they show evidence of a correlation among the wavebands covered by the above experiments ( see   3 ) , except egret which detected no emission from mrk 501 .",
    "the implications of these results are discussed in ",
    "the vhe observations reported in this paper were made with the atmospheric erenkov imaging technique ( @xcite ) using the 10  m optical reflector located at the whipple observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins in arizona ( elevation 2.3 km ) ( @xcite ) . a 151 photomultiplier tube ( upgraded in 1996 from 109 )",
    "camera mounted in the focal plane of the reflector records images of atmospheric erenkov radiation from air showers produced by @xmath1-rays and cosmic rays .",
    "the @xmath1-ray selection was based on the supercuts criteria ( reynolds et al .",
    "1993 ) , however the camera upgrade necessitated that the analysis cuts be changed slightly ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data reported in this paper are analyzed with a _ tracking _",
    "analysis ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "count rates for @xmath1-rays are converted to integral fluxes by expressing them as a multiple of the crab nebula count rate and then multiplying that fraction by the crab nebula flux : @xmath6 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the errors in the absolute fluxes listed below are in general dominated by the uncertainty in the crab nebula flux .",
    "the statistical significance of the detections are more accurately indicated by the @xmath1-ray count rates ( see fig .  [",
    "this procedure assumes that the vhe @xmath1-ray flux of the crab nebula is steady , as 7 years of whipple observatory data indicate ( @xcite ) , and that the mrk 501 spectrum is identical to that of the crab nebula between 0.3 and 10 tev , @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , which may not be the case .",
    "estimates of the vhe spectrum of markarian 501 will be undertaken in future work .",
    "vhe observations of mrk 501 were taken nightly april 7  19 , for a total exposure of 19.9 hours . the mean flux above 350 gev during this period was ( 16.4@xmath103.9)@xmath1110@xmath12 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 , which is @xmath21.6 times the flux of the crab nebula . by comparison ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray flux from mrk 501 was never recorded to be higher than 0.5 times the crab nebula flux in previous seasons ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flux during april ranged from a low of ( 4.9@xmath101.8)@xmath1110@xmath12 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 on april 19 to a high of ( 40.5@xmath109.6)@xmath1110@xmath12 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 on april 16 .",
    "the latter is the highest flux recorded from mrk 501 by the whipple observatory .",
    "no evidence of hour - scale variability was found within this data set .",
    "optical observations were taken april 7  15 with the 1.2 m ritchey - chrtien telescope of the whipple observatory using standard ubvri filters .",
    "the 12  full field ccd frames were analyzed using relative photometry with a 6  aperture applied to mrk  501 and several comparison stars in the field of view .",
    "the u - band fluxes ( see fig .",
    "[ lc]d ) are expressed in arbitrary units with no galaxy light subtraction .",
    "these results are described in detail by buckley & mcenery ( 1997 ) .",
    "_ cgro _ observed mrk  501 for the period april 9  15 as the result of a target of opportunity initiated in response to the reported high level of vhe @xmath1-ray activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we report here on the measurements of the osse and egret instruments on _",
    "cgro_.    osse observes @xmath1-rays in the 0.05  10 mev energy range . a description of osse",
    ", its performance and analysis procedures is given by johnson et al .",
    "for the observation of mrk  501 , the _ cgro _ viewing attitude and the osse observing sequence were selected to avoid the x - ray binary hercules x-1 and the egret source 4c  38.41 .",
    "this was achieved by viewing mrk  501 @xmath13 off axis , or at @xmath14 of maximum response , and by making background observations which were offset by @xmath15 .    the osse data taken during this 6 day period yielded a very strong detection of mrk  501 ( see table  [ osseflux ] ) .",
    "the daily flux observed by osse varied by over a factor of 2 , peaking on april 13 ( see fig .  [ lc ] ) .",
    "mrk  501 has not previously been observed by osse , so no comparison to previous flux levels can be made .",
    "the average @xmath16 kev flux detected from mrk  501 is higher than the emission seen by osse from any other blazar ( @xcite ) except the highest recorded state from 3c  273 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that it may not be strictly valid to compare mrk 501 to 3c  273 because the latter object is not a typical blazar .",
    "the average of the osse data for this 6 day observation is well fit by a single power law in the energy range 0.05  2.0 mev ( @xmath17dof@xmath18 , 64 dof ) of the form : @xmath19 where the uncertainties represent the 68% confidence interval for joint variation of two parameters ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the spectral index is somewhat steep compared to osse spectra of other blazars but it is still within the 1.0  2.1 range reported by mcnaron - brown et al .",
    "there was no statistically significant variation in the power law index with time when fitting power law spectra to the 6 daily average osse measurements .",
    "the egret instrument ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) is sensitive to @xmath1-rays in the energy range spanning approximately 30 mev - 30 gev .",
    "the egret data were analyzed with maximum likelihood techniques ( @xcite ) , taking into account the contributions of isotropic and galactic diffuse emission ( @xcite ) and other bright sources near the position of mrk 501 .",
    "the observations taken april 9  15 indicate an excess of 1.5@xmath21 , which corresponds to a 2@xmath21 upper limit of @xmath22(@xmath23100 mev ) @xmath24 3.6 @xmath1110@xmath25 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ lc ] shows daily flux levels for the contemporaneous observations of mrk 501 . the average flux level in the u - band in march is also included in the figure ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ lc]d ) to indicate the significant ( @xmath310% ) increase in flux between march and april .",
    "an 11 day rise and fall in flux is evident in the vhe and asm wavebands with peaks on april 13 and 16 .",
    "the 50 - 150 kev flux detected by osse also increases between april 9 and 15 with a peak on april 13 .",
    "the optical data may show a correlated rise but the variation is small ( at most 6% ) .",
    "subtraction of the galaxy light contribution will increase the amplitude of this variation , but it should still remain lower than in x - rays given that the r - band contribution of the galaxy light is @xmath275% ( @xcite ) and the u - band contribution should be much less",
    ". the ratio of the fluxes between april 13 and april 9 are 4.2 , 2.6 , 1.7 , and 1.01 for the vhe , osse , asm , and u - band emission respectively .    in figure  [ nufnu_plot ]",
    "we show the spectral energy distribution , plotted as the power per logarithmic bandwidth , @xmath26 , versus frequency , @xmath27 . the average flux for april 9  15 , the duration of the _ cgro _ too , is indicated by the filled circles .",
    "the filled square indicates the peak vhe @xmath1-ray flux from april 16 .",
    "the osse data for this plot have been divided into 8 energy bands between 50 kev and 470 kev .",
    "no excess emission is seen above 470 kev so those data are not shown . the vhe integral fluxes are converted to single point fluxes by assuming the spectrum follows a power law with the same spectral index as the crab nebula .",
    "the egret integral flux upper limit is converted to a single point flux limit assuming @xmath28 .",
    "the asm 2 - 10 kev count rate is converted to a flux point by normalizing to the crab flux and assuming mrk 501 has the same photon spectrum as the crab ( @xmath29 ) within that energy range . from fig .",
    "[ nufnu_plot ] , a peak in the power output occurs within the 2 - 100 kev range and the vhe @xmath1-ray power output is much higher than at egret energies but somewhat below that in the 2 - 100 kev range .",
    "the results presented here show that for mrk 501 , like mrk 421 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the vhe @xmath1-rays and the soft x - rays vary together , the energy budget at x - rays and @xmath1-rays is comparable , there is evidence of correlated optical variability , and the cut - off in the synchrotron emission occurs at much higher energies than in radio - selected bl lacs or flat - spectrum radio quasars . however , mrk  421 has a large deficit in energy output between 1 kev and 50 kev ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "with mrk 501 , there is instead a peak in the power output at @xmath2100 kev , and the deficit has shifted to between 1 mev and 350 gev . also , the variability amplitude for the vhe @xmath1-rays is larger than the x - ray and osse variations , whereas similar flares in mrk 421 showed comparable amplitude variations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a likely explanation of the osse detection is that the synchrotron emission in mrk 501 extends to 100 kev , compared with the @xmath21 kev cutoff seen in mrk 421 . if this is synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons , then the maximum electron lorentz factor is given by @xmath30/b\\delta]^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath31 is the magnetic field strength in gauss , @xmath32 is the doppler factor of the radiating plasma , and @xmath33 is the cutoff energy of the synchrotron spectrum in units of 100 kev .",
    "the correlated variability between the hard x - rays and the vhe @xmath1-rays implies that the same nonthermal electrons are responsible for the two emission components ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , with the vhe @xmath1-rays produced by compton scattering of either internal synchrotron photons ( e.g. , @xcite ; maraschi , ghisellini , & celotti 1992 ; @xcite ) or photons produced external to the jet ( e.g. , dermer , schickeiser , & mastichiadis 1992 ; @xcite ; sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) . for low redshift objects , electrons must have lorentz factors @xmath34 to compton - scatter photons to energies of @xmath35 tev .",
    "thus the magnetic field @xmath36 ^ 2 $ ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a lower limit to the magnetic field is implied by the variability of the synchrotron emission .",
    "electrons cool through synchrotron losses in the co - moving frame on a time scale @xmath37 s. the source might intrinsically vary on a longer time scale , so a lower limit to the observed variability time - scale for low - redshift objects is given by @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this expression can be written in terms of the observed photon energy @xmath40 using the relation @xmath41 from synchrotron theory .",
    "putting the above constraints together , the allowed magnetic field strength of the emission region is given by      the asm ( @xmath43 ev ) flux varies on time - scales at least as short as one day , implying that @xmath44  g. such a range of field strengths are expected at the base of a jet from independent considerations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "equation  [ blim ] provides a new test for beaming in @xmath1-ray blazars , although it assumes that the high - energy component arises from compton - scattering of photons by the same nonthermal electrons which produce the synchrotron component .",
    "if the lower limit in equation  [ blim ] exceeds the upper limit when @xmath32 is set equal to 1 , then beaming is implied .",
    "here it is especially crucial to determine the cutoff energy at tev energies . if the high - energy spectrum of mrk 501 continues without break to @xmath45 tev ,",
    "then beaming is implied .",
    "this beaming test complements @xmath46 transparency arguments which also provide lower limits to @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath47 gev @xmath1-rays interact with the x - ray photons in the extreme relativistic regime of pair production ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , which has been treated by dermer & gehrels ( 1995 ) .",
    "one finds that @xmath49 for this interaction , so no beaming is required .",
    "improved limits to the doppler factor through @xmath46 transparency arguments and from equation  [ blim ] will be obtained if short time scale correlations are detected between vhe @xmath1-rays and photons in the euve or optical regime .",
    "also , if the spectrum observed with osse extends beyond 0.511 mev , @xmath46 transparency arguments can be applied to this @xmath1-ray emission directly ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it will be important to investigate whether the extension of the synchrotron emission in mrk 501 to 100 kev is always present , or only occurred during the flaring activity shown in this work .",
    "previous compilations of x - ray spectra for mrk 501 spanning 0.03 - 30 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) are not conclusive , mainly due to the low statistics at the high energies .",
    "further studies of mrk 501 with osse and the high energy instruments on _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ could resolve this issue .",
    "we acknowledge the technical assistance of k. harris .",
    "this research is supported by grants from the u. s. department of energy and by nasa , by pparc in the uk and by forbairt in ireland .",
    "the x - ray data in this work are quicklook results presented by the asm / rxte team ."
