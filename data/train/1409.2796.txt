    "there are few generic predictions in brane world models as possible extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the fields propagating in the multidimensional bulk manifest themselves as kk towers of states on the brane , where we are supposed to live .",
    "these kk tower of states are an example of such generic predictions .",
    "another phenomenon of this kind is the presence of a new scalar field ( or fields ) on `` our '' brane ( tev - brane ) associated with spin-0 fluctuations of the metric component corresponding to extra space dimension .",
    "the size of the extra space dimension should be stabilized in order to get a physically meaningful picture .",
    "this leads to the violation of the dilatation invariance , and the spin-0 component of metric fluctuations being combined in some manner with the additional scalar field introduced for stabilizing the size renders a new scalar field called the radion field .",
    "this radion field plays the role of the dilaton in the system at hand .    the randall - sundrum setup @xcite with stabilizing scalar field as proposed by goldberger and wise @xcite or worked out by dewolfe , freedman , gubser and karch @xcite , taking into account the backreaction by solving exactly the coupled equations for the metric and the scalar field , provides an example of a concrete realization of a stabilized brane world model . in a number of studies it was argued that the lowest scalar state , usually called the radion @xcite , might be significantly lighter than all the other kk excitations @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the radion follows from the simple effective lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the trace of the sm energy - momentum tensor , @xmath6 stands for the radion field , and @xmath7 , the notation @xmath8 is also often used . @xmath9 and",
    "another often used parameter @xmath10 are related by @xmath11 . ]",
    "is a dimensional scale parameter .",
    "since the radion plays the role of the dilaton , it interacts with the massless photon and gluon fields via the well - known dilatation anomaly in the trace of the energy momentum tensor . at the lowest order in the sm couplings the trace has the following form , where the fields , as supposed in most of the studies , are taken on the mass - shell , @xmath12 and the sum",
    "is taken over all sm fermions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the well - known qcd and qed @xmath15-functions .",
    "the interaction vertices of the radion with the sm fields are similar to those of the sm higgs boson except for the anomaly enhanced interactions with gluons and photons .",
    "this leads to the corresponding relative enhancement in gluon and photon decay modes and the gluon - gluon fusion production channel of the radion .",
    "various aspects of the decay and production properties of the radion have been touched upon in a number of studies , including a possible mixing of the radion with the higgs boson , which is important for the radion and higgs phenomenology @xcite - @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the higgs - like boson at the lhc @xcite few studies have been curried out investigating a possible impact of the radion as the second scalar particle on the interpretation of the observed boson @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the details depend on particular assumptions of the scenario under consideration , such as which fields propagate in the bulk and which are localized on the brane , what is the higgs - radion mixing mechanism and what is the mixing parameter etc . but generically the light radion with mass below or above the observed 126 gev boson is still not fully excluded by all the ew precision constrains and the lhc data .",
    "the fermion part of lagrangian ( [ l1 ] ) for on - shell fermions has a very simple form @xmath16 being the same as for the higgs boson with the replacement of the scale @xmath9 by the higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath17 .",
    "however , for the case of off - shell fermions lagrangian ( [ lferm_onshell ] ) needs to be modified .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian can be written symbolically in the following form ( the explicit form of the lagrangian is given in appendix 1 ) @xcite @xmath18 + ...   \\label{lferm_offshell}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are the sm covariant derivatives .",
    "note that lagrangian ( [ lferm_offshell ] ) is non - trivial even for massless fermions .",
    "the aim of this short study is to investigate a possible influence of these additional terms on the processes with tree level diagrams involving the radion and off - shell fermion lines .",
    "the extra terms in the lagrangian lead to a momentum dependence in the vertices potentially giving additional contributions if virtual fermions participate in the process . for the main radion decay processes the fermions are on - shell , and these additional terms in the vertices vanish , but this might not be the case for the radion production .",
    "however , it will be explicitly demonstrated that due to the gauge invariance all the additional contributions to the amplitudes of physical processes are canceled out , and the result for the matrix element is the same as computed with only higgs - like lagrangian ( [ lferm_onshell ] ) .",
    "one should stress that in order to get the mentioned cancellations the trace @xmath20 of the sm energy momentum tensor should be computed including the sm covariant derivatives as given in appendix 1 .",
    "the corresponding feynman rules containing new 4-point vertices are presented in appendix 2 .",
    "we begin with a simple example of the radion production in the radion - strahlung process .",
    "then we give a more general explanation demonstrating how the cancellation takes place and show a few more examples for the main radion production processes at the lhc and at a linear collider .",
    "we begin with a very simple example , the radion production in association with @xmath21 boson in @xmath22 collisions called the radion - strahlung by analogy with the well - known higgs production process , the higgs - strahlung . even neglecting the very small electron mass",
    "there are four contributing feynman diagrams at the lowest order shown in fig.[fig : radion - strahlung - diagrams ] .",
    "note that the presence of the last 4-point diagram is a consequence of the gauge invariance .",
    "the feynman rules for the vertices involved are given in appendix 2 .",
    "correspondingly the diagrams give the following contributions to the process amplitude @xmath23 @xmath24\\,\\frac{\\cancel{k}}{k^2}\\ , \\gamma_{\\mu}\\,e^-(p_1)\\,\\varepsilon(p_z)\\,r(p_r)\\ ] ] @xmath25 \\,e^-(p_1)\\,\\varepsilon(p_z)\\,r(p_r)\\ ] ] @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "keeping in mind the dirac equation @xmath32 and the equality @xmath33 it is easy to see that the sum of two diagrams d2 and d3 is exactly canceled out by the last diagram d4 , so @xmath34 therefore the matrix element squared @xmath35 for the radion production is exactly equal to that for the higgs boson , and the cross section takes the well - known form with the replacement @xmath17 and @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "as one can see all the additional contributions are canceled out .",
    "the same property of the cancellation of additional to the higgs - like contributions takes place for the associated radion and @xmath39 boson production , for example , @xmath40 where there are also 4 contributing diagrams similar to those in fig.[fig : radion - strahlung - diagrams ] .",
    "the observed cancellation follows from the structure of the fermion current with the emission of the radion and a number of gauge bosons .",
    "let us begin with a simple case with just one gauge boson emission as shown in fig.[fig : radion-1v - diagrams ] .",
    "it corresponds to the radion - strahlung process considered in the previous section with z boson emission .",

    "the final spinors correspond to the same fermion for the neutral fermion current and they are different for the charged current .",
    "once more one can easily see that using the dirac equation for @xmath52 and @xmath53 fermion states and summing up @xmath54 the only remaining contribution is proportional to the fermion mass and is the same as that for the higgs boson .",
