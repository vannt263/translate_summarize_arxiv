    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model has been extensively studied for several decades [ 1 - 3 ] . in recent years",
    "there has been strong interest in the study of quark matter at high densities , using the njl model and related models . in particular",
    ", one finds color superconductivity under certain conditions and it has been suggested that some compact stars might be made of superconducting quark matter [ 4 - 10 ] .",
    "it is our belief that in such studies one should use a model which reproduces , as well as possible , know features of qcd . in this work",
    "we wish to generalize the su(3)-flavor version of the njl model to be consistent with the type of momentum - dependent quark masses found in lattice simulations of qcd [ 11 ] .",
    "for example , in figs . 1 and 2 we show some of the results obtained in ref . [ 11 ] .",
    "it may be seen from these figures that , in euclidean space , the quark mass goes over to the current mass for euclidean momentum @xmath2 2 gev . on the other hand , the njl model , in the standard analysis [ 1 ] ,",
    "gives rise to a constant value for the constituent quark mass .",
    "as we will see , the form of the nonlocality used here is different from that used in refs .",
    "[ 6 , 12 - 16 ] .",
    "for example , in reference [ 12 ] the @xmath3 vertex is modified by a form factor which depends on the relative momentum of the quark and antiquark , while , in another scheme , a form factor is associated with each quark line appearing in a diagram . in the latter procedure",
    "no further regularization is needed .",
    "however , for the problem considered in this work , the nonlocal models that appear in the literature are of limited applicability , since , in the limit of zero current quark mass , the quark self - energy is proportional to the form factors used to define the nonlocality [ 12 ] . in contrast , in the current work , we calculate the form of the quark self - energy after introducing a regulator and a nonlocal quark interaction .",
    "we stress that the procedure used here differs from any that appears in the literature .",
    "the organization of our work is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the standard analysis for the condensates and  gap equation \" of the su(3)-flavor njl model [ 1 ] .",
    "we then go on to review a procedure for including the contribution to the quark self - energy due to the addition of a confining interaction for the case of the su(2)-flavor model . in section iii",
    "we introduce a nonlocal interaction in the su(3)-flavor njl model while maintaining the separable nature of the interaction .",
    "we also describe the approximation used for the t hooft interaction in the nonlocal model . in section iv and v we present some of the results of our numerical calculations . in section",
    "vi we discuss the density dependence of the quark condensate and the momentum dependent quark mass . finally , section vii contains some additional discussion and conclusions .     using an extrapolation of the current quark mass to zero .",
    "( the small dip at @xmath4 gev is not statistically significant [ 11 ] . ]",
    "in order to best introduce the nonlocal model , we will first review the calculation of the quark self - energy in the local su(3)-flavor njl model and then proceed to add a confinement interaction , as was done in an earlier study of the quark self - energy [ 17 ] .",
    "we consider the generalization to a model with nonlocal short - range and t hooft interactions in the next section .",

    "<S> the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model has been extensively studied by many researchers . in previous work </S>",
    "<S> we have generalized the njl model to include a covariant model of confinement . in the present work we consider further modification of the model so as to reproduce the type of euclidean - space momentum - dependent quark mass values obtained in lattice simulations of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> this may be done by introducing a nonlocal interaction , while preserving the chiral symmetry of the lagrangian . in other work on nonlocal models , by other researchers , the momentum dependence of the quark self - energy is directly related to the regularization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in our work , the regularization is independent of the nonlocality we introduce . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to note that the value of the condensate ratio , @xmath0 , is about 1.7 when evaluated using chiral perturbation theory and is only about 1.1 in standard applications of the njl model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our nonlocal model can reproduce the larger value of the condensate ratio when reasonable values are used for the strength of the t hooft interaction . </S>",
    "<S> ( in an earlier study of the @xmath1(547 ) and @xmath1(958 ) mesons , we found that use of the larger value of the condensate ratio led to a very good fit to the mixing angles and decay constants of these mesons . ) </S>",
    "<S> we also study the density dependence of both the quark condensate and the momentum - dependent quark mass values . without the addition of new parameters , we reproduce the density dependence of the condensate given by a well - known model - independent expression valid for small baryon density . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization of our model to include a model of confinement required the introduction of an additional parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the further generalization to obtain a nonlocal model also requires additional parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , we believe our results are of sufficient interest so as to compensate for the introduction of the additional parameters in our formalism . </S>"
