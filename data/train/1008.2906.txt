    "although the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect is a fundamental question in quantum physics , and despite the original work on the ab effect has been published 50 years ago @xcite , it is still a very active area of research with many open mathematical questions . here",
    "we address some of these questions and , our first aim is to try to characterize , in the two - dimensional space , all boundary conditions on the ( cylindrical ) solenoid border @xmath1 that are compatible with quantum mechanics , and whose domains are subspaces of the natural sobolev space @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the exterior region of the solenoid .",
    "our ( standard ) cylindrical solenoid @xmath1 has radius @xmath4 , is infinitely long and centered at the origin ( with axis coinciding with the @xmath5 direction ) , it carries a stationary electric current so that there is a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath6 confined to the solenoid interior @xmath7 , and vanishing in the exterior region @xmath3 . a spinless charged particle of mass @xmath8 lives in @xmath3 and has no contact with the magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 is a vector potential that generates such magnetic field , that is , @xmath11 , the initial ( quantum ) ab hamiltonian operator for such charged particle is given by ( with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the speed of light and particle electric charge , respectively ) @xmath15 ahead , we will fix a specific choice of the vector potential .",
    "this operator @xmath16 is not self - adjoint and so does not correspond to a physical observable ; the possible self - adjoint extensions characterize all possible physical interaction of the particle with the solenoid border ( sometimes obtained through non - trivial limit procedures ) .",
    "it is important to note that the elements @xmath17 of the domain @xmath18 do not touch @xmath1 ( in the sense that @xmath19 in a neighborhood of the solenoid ) and @xmath20 has a very simple action .",
    "such collection of `` exotic '' extensions might , for instance , include the description of limit situations where singular perturbations ( that could also depend on time ) are slowly turned off .",
    "it is usually assumed that the domain of the `` physical '' self - adjoint extensions is dirichlet ( i.e. , @xmath19 on @xmath1 ) , and some theoretical arguments have appeared to justify such choice ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , here we take an open - minded position and ask about other possibilities of boundary conditions . in a general sense , these other conditions correspond to the requirement of vanishing of the probability current at the solenoid border , and they may model different sorts of interactions between the particle and the solenoid . in section  [ sectionsae ]",
    "we characterize all of such boundary conditions whose domain of the corresponding self - adjoint hamiltonians are composed of functions with square integrable first and second derivatives ( these are rather natural technical conditions in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "the operator @xmath16 above has deficiency indices equal to infinity , and its self - adjoint extensions should be compared with the case of solenoid of zero radius discussed , for instance , in @xcite , where the deficiency indices are equal to  2 .    in section  [ sectionscatter ] the two - dimensional scattering",
    "will be discussed in this context , but restricted to the traditional boundary conditions : dirichlet , neumann and robin .",
    "in fact , the case of dirichlet was investigated in @xcite and part of our results are based on the techniques discussed therein . the scattering in case of solenoids with zero radius is discussed in @xcite .    for solenoids of radius greater than zero , and the above",
    "mentioned traditional extensions , we will show that the wave operators exist and are complete ; we also find expressions for the scattering operators and their asymptotic behaviours for low and high energies .",
    "finally , we will find explicitly the respective differential scattering cross sections ( an important ingredient in experiments ) and some figures will compare their values . from some point of view , the discrepancy among such figures could , in principle , be useful for an experimental selection of the boundary condition occurring in each situation ; in principle it is not obvious which boundary conditions are naturally realized in laboratories , and we have found that given two of such self - adjoint extensions , it is always possible to find a range of energy so that the corresponding scattering cross sections can be distinguished .",
    "in this section we find and characterize an important class of self - adjoint extensions of the initial hamiltonian  @xmath16 ( see equation ) , with vector potential @xmath21 given , in polar coordinates @xmath22 , by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the total magnetic flux through the solenoid .",
    "as will be discussed in section  [ sectionscatter ] , this hermitian operator has deficiency indices @xcite @xmath28 , and so it has infinitely many self - adjoint extensions .",
    "the first physical and mathematical point to be addressed is to find some self - adjoint operators that may potentially describe the aharonov - bohm hamiltonian of a charged particle moving in the exterior region @xmath29 .",
    "this particle can not penetrate the solenoid but interacts with @xmath1 , and the boundary conditions that give rise to self - adjoint realizations are the possible conditions , from the point of view of quantum mechanics , that may describe such interaction with different types of interface materials and limit procedures .",
    "we note that in order to classify all such extensions it is necessary to make use of some sobolev spaces @xmath30 with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , another difficulty is that the domain of the adjoint operator @xmath32 is not contained in the space @xmath2 @xcite , which has proved to be natural in quantum problems .",
    "below we shall restrict our arguments to the extensions whose domains are contained in @xmath2 , which will permit us to use boundary triples to find these extensions in a quite simpler way ( see remark  [ remahneg ] ) .",
    "due to the symmetry of the problem , we shall consider a planar cross section ; another fact is that the solenoid border in @xmath33 is not a compact set , and so it is not clear how to define the trace operators in the spatial case ( and we want to avoid this technical point ) .",
    "the reader interested only in the final results may go straightly to theorem  [ mainteor ] and the examples that follow this theorem .",
    "our way to find self - adjoint extensions of @xmath16 is via boundary triples @xmath34 , as described in @xcite , chapter  7 , so we present a brief account of this technique .",
    "let @xmath35 be a hermitian operator in a hilbert space @xmath36 .",
    "the _ boundary form _ of @xmath35 is the sesquilinear mapping @xmath37 given by @xmath38    @xmath39 , for all @xmath40 , if , and only if , @xmath41 is self - adjoint , that is , if , and only if , @xmath35 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "boundary forms can be used to determine self - adjoint extensions of @xmath35 by noting that such extensions are restrictions of @xmath41 to certain domains @xmath42 such that @xmath43 , for all @xmath44 . by von neumann theory @xcite , each self - adjoint extension of @xmath35 is in a one - to - one correspondence with unitary operators @xmath45 between the deficiency subspaces @xmath46 of @xmath35 ; denote by @xmath47 the corresponding self - adjoint extension whose domains is ( @xmath48 denotes the closure of the operator  @xmath35 ) @xmath49 note that the boundary form @xmath50 restricted to @xmath51 vanishes .",
    "now we recall the concept of boundary triples .",

    "@xmath58 denotes the inner product in @xmath54 and @xmath59 .",
    "again , self - adjoint extensions of @xmath35 are restrictions of @xmath41 to certain domains @xmath42 so that @xmath39 , for all @xmath60 , and given a boundary triple for @xmath35 , such domains @xmath42 are related to unitary operators @xmath61 so that @xmath62 and @xmath63    the main results we need here are summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ extviatriplas ] let @xmath35 be a hermitian operator with equal deficiency indices .",
    "if @xmath53 is a boundary triple for @xmath35 , then the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath35 are given by @xmath64 for each unitary operator @xmath65 .",
    "some self - adjoint extensions of the initial ab operator @xmath16 will be found .",
    "it will combine the cylindrical symmetry with the topological property of multiply connectedness , that is , the plane with a circular hole , without mentioning the important ingredient of a magnetic potential @xmath10 with @xmath66 in @xmath3 .",
    "the method can be adapted to other regions with boundaries so that the trace construction applies ( e.g. , smooth and compact boundaries ) .",
    "although a @xmath67 is not necessarily continuous , it is possible to give a meaning to the restriction @xmath68 via the so - called _ trace _ ( more properly , it should be called _ sobolev trace _ ) of @xmath17 ; see ahead .",
    "it turns out that there is a continuous linear mapping @xmath69 , @xmath70 , that is , there is @xmath71 so that @xmath72 note that for @xmath73 the boundary values @xmath74 are well defined for any angle @xmath75 . by density",
    ", this mapping has a unique continuous extension @xmath76 , called the _ trace mapping _ ( see chapters  1 and  2 of @xcite and also @xcite ) , and one defines @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "similarly it is defined the trace mapping @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the normalized vector normal to @xmath1 pointing to inside the solenoid .",
    "we shall also make use of the green s formulae @xmath81 which holds for all @xmath82 , and @xmath83 @xmath84 which hold for all @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the `` surface '' measure in @xmath1 ( recall that here @xmath1 is the circle centered at the origin and radius @xmath4 ) , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 are the unit vectors along the axes @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "note that the kernel of the trace operator @xmath92 is the hilbert space @xmath93 which can also be defined as the closure of @xmath94 in @xmath95 .",
    "now we introduce a boundary form @xmath50 for the initial ab operator , and companion mappings @xmath96 and @xmath97 as well .",
    "the boundary form of @xmath16 , for @xmath98 , is @xmath99 and by restricting to those self - adjoint extensions whose domains are contained in  @xmath2 , sobolev traces can be invoked . since @xmath66 , the boundary form of @xmath16",
    "is found to be given by @xmath100 for all @xmath101 .    by passing to polar",
