    "since we find the same signal deficit in the magnetization data , to be described below , we think it may be ascribed either to the presence of traces of an extra phase ( sn flux ) , resulting in a small over estimation of the actual amount of euptsi@xmath0 present in the sample , or to a slight off - stoichiometry of eu .",
    "evidence for the presence of sn in the crystals , evoked above , favours the first possibility . since",

    "the magnetizations along the two principal directions increase linearly with the field , with similar slopes . for @xmath4   [ 001 ]",
    ", there is an abrupt increase of the magnetization at 1  t followed by a faster linear increase up to 5.9  t ; above 5.9  t , the magnetization is saturated with a value 6.43  @xmath6/eu . for @xmath4  [ 100 ] , the magnetization shows a linear increase with field and saturates to the same value at a higher field of 9.2  t. the apparent saturation moment is lower than the eu@xmath14 free ion value ( 7  @xmath6/eu ) by 8% , which , as discussed above , leads us to think that there is a small amount of sn flux in the sample .",
    "the overall behaviour of the magnetization versus field indicates an antiferromagnetic ( af ) structure . in a first analysis ,",
    "the metamagnetic transition at @xmath5  =  1  t for @xmath7 [ 001 ] and the smaller value for the saturation field along [ 001 ] are characteristic of a two - sublattice af structure , with moments in zero field along [ 001 ] and with a small crystalline anisotropy along this axis  @xcite . then , the field @xmath5 is the spin - flop field for which the moments along [ 001 ] reorient perpendicular to the field , and the critical fields of 5.9 and 9.2  t are the spin - flip fields ( @xmath35 ) for full alignment with the applied field in each direction .",
    "the spin - flip field @xmath35 along [ 100 ] is larger because [ 100 ] is a hard magnetic axis .",
    "however , the fact that the magnetization along [ 001 ] is not zero below @xmath5 and the presence of a slight metamagnetic transition along [ 100 ] at 1.5  t show that the magnetic structure is more complex than described above , and in particular that the eu@xmath14 moments ( in zero field ) are not exactly aligned along [ 001 ] .",
    "anisotropy in the spin flip fields has been observed in some gd compounds  @xcite , in euas@xmath0  @xcite and in eupdsb  @xcite .",
    "it arises in principle from the crystal field  @xcite , although typically eu@xmath14 and gd@xmath17 ions , which have @xmath16  =  0 , show very small magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "another source of anisotropy could be two - ion exchange , although the simple model of an anisotropic molecular field tensor developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a two - sublattice af structure predicts that the spin - flip fields should be the same for both directions .",
    "so we tentatively attribute the observed behaviour mainly to an anomalously large crystalline anisotropy of eu@xmath14 in euptsi@xmath0 .",

    ", the values of the critical fields along [ 001 ] can be reproduced with @xmath36 = 3.0  t and @xmath43 = 0.085  t , which are reasonable values , but then the critical field along [ 100 ] is 6.25  t , too small with respect to experiment ( 9.2  t ) .",
    "so this simple model also fails to reproduce in detail the magnetization behaviour , which is probably due to a magnetic structure more complex than two af sublattices with moments aligned along [ 001 ] .",
    "nevertheless , a hint to the presence of exchange anisotropy is given by the different values of the paramagnetic curie temperature along the two axes . indeed , in terms of the exchange integrals with nearest neighbours @xmath44 and with second neighbours @xmath45 along direction @xmath46 , one has ,",
    "on the one hand  @xcite : @xmath47 the anisotropy of @xmath34 then can stem from an anisotropy of the exchange constants . on the other hand",

    "is negative and @xmath51 is positive with @xmath52 , then the magnetic structure is of af type . if these conditions are also fulfilled for the exchange integrals along directions [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] , then the paramagnetic curie temperatures are positive , and @xmath53 , as observed euptsi@xmath0 .",
    "we have also recorded the magnetization data at various temperatures for @xmath7 [ 001 ] . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the spin - flop transition shifts slightly to higher fields and then it decreases as the temperature is increased .",

    "incidentally , isostructural ceptsi@xmath0 also exhibits two magnetic transitions at 4.8  k and 2.4  k respectively  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic part of heat capacity @xmath55 was deduced by the usual method of subtracting the heat capacity of laptsi@xmath0 from that of euptsi@xmath0 after taking into account the renormalization due to different atomic masses of la and eu .",

    "the entropy is about @xmath57  ln8 at @xmath1 but above @xmath1 it exceeds the theoretical value of @xmath58  ln8 for @xmath59 .",
    "while short range order above @xmath1 , which is typically present in the paramagnetic state , would explain the observed values of entropy up to @xmath1 , the increase of entropy beyond @xmath58  ln8 at higher temperatures suggests that laptsi@xmath0 may not be a good reference for the lattice heat capacity of euptsi@xmath0 .",
    "we believe such an indication is reflected by the heat capacity plots of the two compounds which show an increasing divergence from each other at high temperatures .",

    "@xcite have calculated the heat capacity jumps at the magnetic transition for two types of magnetic structures , namely , the equal moment ( em ) where the magnetic moments are the same at all sites and the amplitude modulated ( am ) , where the magnetic moment amplitude varies periodically from one site to another . for the case of em structure , the jump in the heat capacity at the ordering temperature",

    "since the effects of crystal electric field for @xmath65 , divalent state of eu are negligible , the total angular momentum @xmath64   ( = 7/2 ) can be used in the above equations .",
    "@xmath66 amounts to 20.14  j / k@xmath67mol for the em case , while for the am case , @xmath68 equals 13.4  j / k@xmath67mol .",
    "thus , theoretically , the jump in the heat capacity at the magnetic transition for am case is reduced to 2/3 of the value for em case  @xcite .",
    "our estimate of @xmath60 ( 14.6  j / k@xmath67mol ) at @xmath1 thus strongly suggests that euptsi@xmath0 possesses an amplitude modulated structure .",
    "furthermore , blanco  _ et al _ found that for the amplitude modulated system a hump in the heat capacity occurs below the ordering temperature , to compensate the loss of entropy just below @xmath31 , which incidentally is seen in euptsi@xmath0 as shown in fig .",

    "mssbauer absorption spectra were recorded in euptsi@xmath0 in the temperature range 4.2 to 19  k and at 300  k. spectra at selected temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "all the spectra point to the presence of eu@xmath14 with no traces of eu@xmath17 impurity content .",
    "the isomer shift of all the spectra was found to be -10.0(4 ) mm / s arising from the divalent state of eu ions .",
    "a single line is observed from room temperature down to 19  k. at 300  k the line width is 2.65  mm / s which is a standard value for a eu@xmath14 compound and it increases to 3.2  mm / s at 19  k , due to the dynamic short range order close to the first magnetic transition at @xmath31 = 17  k. at 4.2  k , a magnetic hyperfine field of 33.0(5 )  t can be derived from the spectrum , which is a standard value for the fermi contact interaction in eu@xmath14 materials .",
    "on increasing the temperature , the hyperfine field decreases steadily , reaching 16.8(5 )  t at 16  k and the lines are narrow , indicative of a commensurate magnetic order with a single moment value ( em structure ) . at 17  k ,",
    "the spectral shape changes suddenly , as can be seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] : a broad distribution of hyperfine fields is present at the nucleus sites .",
    "the spectrum can be fitted to a gaussian - shaped distribution , but a physically more appealing interpretation is the following : below 17  k , where the specific heat data shows its first anomaly , an incommensurate am magnetic structure develops , which yields a distribution of eu@xmath14 moments , and hence of hyperfine fields .",
    "the second peak at 16  k in the specific heat would correspond to a lock - in transition to a commensurate wave - vector , which is not uncommon in intermetallic eu or gd compounds  @xcite .",
    "the fit at 17  k shown in the figure corresponds to an incommensurate modulation , but it can not be distinguished from that to a gaussian shaped distribution .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand why a broad gaussian distribution of hyperfine magnetic fields would appear at 17  k , if it were not because of a phase transition yielding a specific moment distribution .",
    "indeed , it has been reported that such a `` cascade '' of transitions ( paramagnetic - incommensurate am - commensurate em ) occurs for instance in layered semi - metallic euas@xmath0  @xcite below @xmath1 = 11.3  k and @xmath2 = 10.26  k , as well as in eupdsb  @xcite , below @xmath1 = 18  k and @xmath2 = 12  k. we therefore believe the mssbauer and the heat capacity data corroborate each other quite well in demonstrating the presence of a `` cascade '' of transitions in euptsi@xmath69 .",
    "single crystals of euptsi@xmath0 were grown by flux method and the magnetic studies revealed antiferromagnetic transitions at @xmath1 = 17 and @xmath2 = 16  k. from the low temperature isothermal magnetization measurements , we found a spin - flop - like transition at @xmath5 = 1  t for @xmath4  [ 001 ] and spin - flip transitions at 5.9  t ( 9.2  t ) for @xmath4  [ 001 ] ( [ 100 ] ) .",
