    "the detection of electromagnetic fields induced by acceleration in magnetizable materials and metals has a history reaching back more than one century @xcite .",
    "two famous experiments stand out in this respect . in 1915",
    ", barnett measured the magnetic field of a magnetizable material induced by rotating it @xcite .",
    "one year later , tolman and stewart measured the electromotive force if metals are ( linearly ) accelerated @xcite .",
    "they thereafter concluded on the effective mass of the current carrier @xcite , which turned out be somewhat different from that of the electron _ in vacuo_. a more modern experiment with increased precision in rotationally accelerated conductors has been carried out @xcite , where it was found that the mass is the electron mass in vacuum to within about one percent @xcite .",
    "superconductors and , more generally , macroscopically coherent quantum systems , are distinguished by the fact that the mass of the current carriers has been measured , within currently achievable precision of a few ppm to be _ exactly _ twice the bare mass @xmath0 of the electrons _ in vacuo_. the mass is subject to very small ( relativistic ) corrections only , so small as to currently elude precise experimental determination .",
    "the measurement of the bare mass proceeds via the magnetomechanical effect in superconductors , the london moment @xcite .",
    "the london magnetic field induced by rotation ( cf . equation ( [ london ] ) below ) is proportional to the rotation velocity and to the ratio of twice the mass @xmath1 of the superconducting current carriers divided by their charge @xmath2 .",
    "the best measurement to date @xcite yielded for the current carrying cooper pairs a mass @xmath3 .",
    "the london moment is a universal magnetomechanical property of rotating superconductors , independent of specific material properties , and verified not only in conventional superconductors , but also in the high-@xmath4 @xcite and heavy fermion species @xcite .",
    "it furnishes a generalization of the familiar phenomenon of meissner screening to noninertial , material reference frames of the superconducting state .",
    "the london moment , then , represents a particularly striking instance of a quantum protectorate @xcite , for which the phenomenon of macroscopic quantum coherence ( the fact that the quantum of action @xmath5 appears within a macroscopically measurable quantity ) `` protects '' the bare property of a particle .",
    "it is this phenomenon which enables the precise measurements of bare quantities related to the charge and mass of the electron . in the quantum hall effect , one measures in effect the fine structure constant @xmath6 , which can be determined to an accuracy of 0.1 ppb in comparative measurements between two hall probes @xcite . in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) , the quantum of ( cooper pair ) flux @xmath7 is used as a standard to measure magnetic fields with unprecedented precision .",
    "the properties of josephson junctions also made possible , _",
    "e.g. _ , the confirmation of constancy of the _ electrogravitochemical _ potential ( as opposed to the conventional electrochemical potential without the inclusion of a gravitational contribution ) , in a circuit with two josephson junctions separated 7.2 cm in height , which amounts to perpetuating a voltage constancy of @xmath8 volts over a time span of ten hours @xcite . correspondingly , due to the fact that the ratio @xmath9 is on a level of at least one ppm the bare ratio of the vacuum , a superconductor should be able to measure its own state of rotation and , more general , acceleration with very high accuracy .    in the following , we give an account of the influence of noninertial forces on macroscopic quantum devices , as specifically represented by squids and josephson junction arrays .",
    "this includes a study of the perfectly conducting and perfect diamagnetism analogues of the tolman - stewart respectively barnett effects , the latter effect in the superconductor being represented by the london moment .",
    "the prospects of detecting with high precision the force fields related to noninertiality are given .",
    "the fact that the exact bare mass appears in the london equation , which relates mechanical and magnetic quantities , implies that an effective theory , describing the motion of the massive current carriers , may be construed in a particularly transparent way .",
    "specifically , in the linear in velocity , nonrelativistic limit and for small deviations from the minkowski metric of flat space - time , a general gauge invariance principle can be satisfied @xcite , which puts mechanical and proper electromagnetic forces on an equal footing , uniting them into electromagnetomotive forces .",
    "this program of generalized gauge invariance is described in the following section [ force fields ] on the basis of nonrelativistic kinematics . in an appendix",
    ", we outline the derivation of this gauge invariance program extracted from relativistic geodesic motion , and relate the potentials of the noninertial force fields to metric coefficients in weakly perturbed minkowski space - time . in section [ secjja ] we then describe the influence of electromagnetomotive force fields on the electrodynamics of superconducting quantum interferometers . in particular , the influence of acceleration and rotation on the voltage response function of one - dimensional josephson junction arrays is discussed . for special josephson junction arrays , so - called superconducting quantum interference filters @xcite ,",
    "it is explicitly shown how such devices can be used for precision measurements of rotation .",
    "the knowledge of the electromagnetomotive force fields in the superconductor enables as an application the sensitive tracking of the _ trajectory _ of the quantum interference device .",
    "the procedure to be used for that purpose will be outlined in section [ tracking ] .",
    "the noninertial force on a massive test particle inside a rotating and accelerating probe , as measured in the probe s rest frame , is given by the standard expression @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the rotation velocity ; @xmath12 is a possible scalar force on the particle , e.g. , gravity , and @xmath13 its potential .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of ( [ noninertialforces ] ) represents ( minus ) the coriolis force , the second one the centripetal force , and the third term is due to temporal changes of the angular velocity .",
    "the vector @xmath14 is the position of the center of rotation , and @xmath15 is an ( externally imposed ) linear acceleration of this center of rotation ( cf .",
    "[ squid ] ) .",
    "compare the relation ( [ noninertialforces ] ) to the expression for the lorentz force : @xmath16 where as usual , provided that the conventional homogeneous maxwell equations @xmath17 hold , the magnetic and electric fields are derivable from vector and scalar potentials as @xmath18 we , then , define vector and scalar potentials associated    to noninertiality as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance vector perpendicular to the axis of rotation . summing the mechanical and electromagnetical forces , we may infer that for a charged massive particle like electron ( @xmath21 ) or cooper pair ( @xmath22 ) , we can merge the above potentials and the electromagnetic potentials into a generalized vector potential , incorporating the coupling constants charge @xmath2 and mass @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath23 and a generalized scalar potential @xmath24 the sum of the generalized _ electromotive _ and _ magnetomotive _ forces , acting on an electron , consisting of noninertial plus proper lorentz and electric forces , then takes on the form @xmath25 where the generalized electric and magnetic fields are given by the potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 as a consequence of relation ( [ genlorentz ] ) for the total force , the usual expression for the drift velocity of the charge carriers , resulting from zero total force in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields , experiences the obvious modification that @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 .    the generalized electromagnetic force fields displayed in equations ( [ genlorentz ] ) and ( [ genfields ] ) give a theory possessing in effect two u(1 ) gauge symmetries .",

    "the gauge potential of this second u(1 ) has a scalar part @xmath32 and a vectorial part @xmath33 .",
    "the homogeneous maxwell equations @xmath34 then follow from the existence of the generalized potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 in ( [ adef ] ) and ( [ chidef ] ) , which give the fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 in ( [ genfields ] ) .",
    "they are identical to the conventional homogeneous maxwell equations in ( [ convmaxwell ] ) with the replacements @xmath29 and @xmath30 . that the faraday law ( [ faraday ] ) holds is due to our admitting a variation of the angular velocity with time and the resulting force term in ( [ noninertialforces ] ) .",
    "we stress that the fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 are both referring to the frame co - rotating as well as co - moving with the quantum interference device with respect to the laboratory frame .",
    "the laboratory frame velocity @xmath37 as well as the rotation rate @xmath11 can be time dependent in an arbitrary manner .",
    "the gauge invariant particle ( mass ) current induced by the electromotive force field is in linear response @xmath38 observe that the left hand side contains the induced mass current density rather than the electric current density .",
    "the associated response coefficient @xmath39 is measured in units of @xmath40 = [ \\sigma_{el}/q^2]$ ] . in the case of two coupling constants , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is the number of particles crossing a unit area per unit time , which is the relevant observable .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the electromotive force field @xmath41 , which causes these particles to move .",
    "evidence for the necessity of using a _ particle transport _ equation in the form of ( [ sigmadef ] ) comes from the existence of the london field in superconductors .",
    "complete expulsion of the field @xmath36 deep inside in a superconductor requires the particle conductivity @xmath42 to have a contribution proportional to @xmath43 , which yields a term on the right hand side of ( [ sigmadef ] ) , proportional to the generalized vector potential @xmath26 . corresponding to complete meissner type screening , @xmath44 ,",
    "the london spontaneous field @xmath45 then takes the value @xmath46 this relation corresponds to zero winding number of the phase @xmath47 , cf .",
    "equations ( [ pdqint])([phieq ] ) below .",
    "equation ( [ london ] ) was derived by f. london @xcite , and has been verified experimentally already 35 years ago @xcite , in an experiment in which it was used to infer the compton wavelength of superconducting electrons .",
    "if we insert on the left hand side of the equation ( [ london ] ) the bare electron values @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "quantum coherence properties are expressed by the requirement for the line integral of collective particle momentum along a closed path to be quantized : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the winding number of phase @xmath47 , so that the total canonical momentum @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the cooper pair velocity field .",
    "it has a mechanical contribution proportional to @xmath1 and a proper electromagnetic contribution @xmath56 .",
    "the uniqueness condition of the collective phase represented in ( [ pdqint ] ) then leads to the quantization of the sum of a sagnac flux @xcite and the magnetic flux @xmath57 if we take a path in the bulk of the electron liquid , for which the integral of @xmath58 may be neglected .",
    "this flux quantization rule associated with the field @xmath36 corresponds to the fact that a _ vortex _ , represented by a zero in the ( collective ) electron wave function , where the phase @xmath47 becomes singular , is fundamentally characterized by its winding number @xmath53 alone .",
    "no properties of the medium in which it lives , in particular the mass and charge of the medium s constituents , enter the quantum of generalized flux , which is given by planck s quantum of action alone .",
    "the relation for the london moment in ( [ london ] ) , expressing vanishing magnetomotive force field , corresponds to zero winding number of the phase @xmath47 .",
    "the classical property of zero generalized magnetic field @xmath59 expressed by the london moment is hence rooted in the generalized meissner prescription @xmath60 , and thus relates to the quantum coherence property expressed by ( [ phieq ] ) .",
    "the vanishing of the field @xmath41 in the bulk of a noninertial superconductor ( in the static limit of zero frequency ) implies that the proper electric field is nonzero inside the superconductor , and given by @xmath61 \\label{el}\\\\ & = & \\frac{m}{q}\\left({\\bm \\omega}\\times { \\bm \\omega}\\times { \\bm r }   + \\partial_t{\\bm \\omega } \\times { \\bm r}+\\partial_t^2 { \\bm r}_0 + \\nabla\\phi\\right ) \\equiv -\\frac{m}{q } { \\bm g}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is composed of the centrifugal , time variation of @xmath11 , @xmath13 potential and linear acceleration parts .",
    "if the total acceleration @xmath62 is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth , @xmath63 , we have the value @xmath64 for the electric field induced in the superconductor .",
    "the total electromotive force field is thus simply @xmath65 and takes a form analogous to the total magnetomotive force field @xmath66 the fact that there is an electric field associated to acceleration ( which may be material dependent for non - perfect conductors ) was measured by tolman and stewart in metals @xcite .",
    "the general phenomenon associated to @xmath36 , i.e. , the occurrence of a magnetic field if the sample is rotated , was observed for magnetizable materials by barnett @xcite , with a ( possibly anisotropic ) ratio of magnetic field and rotation different from the one displayed by superconductors expressible via the london equation ( [ london ] ) .",
    "the tolman field @xmath67 is a property of ( in the limit of zero frequency ) perfect conductors .",
    "the london field @xmath45 , in turn , is a signature of perfect diamagnetism for rotating samples .",
    "perfect diamagnetism may thus be understood as a hallmark of superconductors in general , be they considered in an inertial or noninertial reference frame . in short : the field @xmath67 is measured if @xmath35 is vanishing and @xmath45 is detected if @xmath36 is completely ( meissner ) screened .",
    "devices based on superconductive quantum interference can be used as ultrasensitive detectors for magnetic fields .",
    "they consist of one , two or even a plurality of josephson junctions or weak links which are connected as an array to form one or several superconducting loops .",
    "prominent exponents are devices containing two junctions per loop , like the dc - squid shown in fig .",
    "[ squid ] .",

    "can have different shapes and sizes .",
    "in particular , judiciously choosing the distribution of the area loop sizes in a suitable unconventional way , 1d parallel arrays can be used as sensors of absolute strength and orientation of magnetic fields .",
    "this is due to the fact that 1d parallel arrays are magnetic field to voltage converters , if they are driven by a bias current of suitable strength . because of their unique response to applied magnetic fields ,",
    "such 1d parallel arrays with unconventional grating are named quantum interference filters ( sqif ) and are explained in greater detail in @xcite .    in the following the josephson junctions",
    "are assumed to be _ short _ junctions such that any spatial variations of the current density along the barriers of the weak links can be safely neglected . in this case",
    "each junction can be described by a gauge invariant phase difference @xmath70 of the macroscopic bcs pairing wave functions on either side of the weak link labeled 1 and 2 respectively . within the range of validity of the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model @xcite the current through the josephson junction",

    "the basic formula describing the effects of magnetomotive effects on superconducting interferometers is the condition of flux quantization .",
    "the generalized magnetic flux @xmath96 through the area of the @xmath90th elementary loop @xmath93 in an 1d parallel array determines via @xmath97 the difference of the phase differences of the two junctions which form this loop .",
    "taken severely this relation holds provided the superconducting loop is made of a material thick compared to the magnetic penetration depth @xmath98 . in this case",
    "there exists a path inside the wire connecting the junctions @xmath90 and @xmath90 + 1 , on which the superfluid velocity field @xmath55 becomes negligibly small .",
