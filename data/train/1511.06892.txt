    "quantum game theory is an interdisciplinary field that combines game theory with quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use the apparatus developed to describe quantum phenomena to analyze macroscopic complex systems ( including living systems ) @xcite . the first attempt to describe a game in the quantum domain applied to finite noncooperative games in the normal form @xcite but soon after that quantum game theory has found applications in various fields including decision sciences @xcite , finance theory @xcite or mathematical psychology @xcite .",
    "physical implementation of a quantum game could be very hard , and experimental realization of such ideas as quantum auctions @xcite is a demanding technological challenge , not to mention any commercial use .",
    "fortunately , in some interesting cases no physical creation of entanglement is necessary if one restrict oneself to phenomenological description or modeling of agent s behavior .",
    "there are suggestions that quantum games can outperform the `` classical '' ones in description of some interesting phenomena in economic theory or social sciences @xcite . in this way",
    ", quantum game theory has developed into an independent analytical tool that uses the sometimes possible advantage of dealing with probability amplitudes instead of probabilities .",
    "the analysis of oligopolies has a long history @xcite and attempts at exploring quantum game theory to this field of research should not surprise us .",
    "most of the attention is focused on the duopoly theory hoping for more reliable modeling .",
    "the generally accepted quantum scheme for these problems is due to li et al .",
    "@xcite . at present",
    ", one can find papers that apply the li ",
    "massar scheme to the cournot duopoly problems and the stackelberg duopoly .",
    "there is also the study of quantum games concerning bertrand duopoly examples @xcite .",
    "the motivation of writing this paper was twofold .",
    "one of the purposes is to extend the quantum game theory based on the li ",
    "massar scheme so that another type of duopoly has the quantum analogue .",
    "the bertrand duopoly in the form studied in the paper is an alternative model of the famous cournot duopoly , where the players compete in prices instead of quantities .",
    "this change makes it impossible to have a positive equilibrium outcome in the bertrand duopoly .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to study this problem in the quantum domain .",
    "on the other hand , our goal is to apply a method of determining nash equilibria that is a new one with respect to the quantum duopolies ( whereas it is commonly used in the classical game theory ) .",
    "the bertrand duopoly example is determined by a piecewise payoff function . as a result ,",
    "the payoff function in the quantum game has similar form .",
    "it requires more sophisticated methods to find all the nash equilibria than ones appeared in the previous papers .",
    "let us recall the classical problem of bertrand duopoly .",
    "there are two firms ( players ) who compete in the price of a homogenous product .",
    "the demand @xmath0 of the product is a function of the price , @xmath1 for every @xmath2 .",
    "the firm with a lower price captures the entire market .",
    "if both firms charge the same price , they split the market equally .",
    "we assume that each firm has the same marginal cost @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "if player 1 sets the price as @xmath5 and player 2 sets the price as @xmath6 the payoff function of player 1 is @xmath7 similarly , the payoff function of player 2 is @xmath8 the bertrand model @xcite was proposed as an alternative to the cournot model  @xcite in which the players compete in quantities ( see also @xcite for more details about these two models ) . while it seems that the rational players would obtain similar payoffs in both games , comparison of the cournot and bertrand duopoly examples with respect to nash equilibria exhibits a paradox . in the cournot duopoly",
    ", the nash equilibrium payoff is @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", the game defined by  ( [ bertrand1])([bertrand2 ] ) has the unique nash equilibrium @xmath10 that arises from intersection of best reply functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 the equilibrium implies the payoff of 0 for both players .",
    "in @xcite we discussed two well - known quantum duopoly schemes  @xcite .",
    "we pointed out that under some condition the li ",
    "massar scheme @xcite appears to be more reasonable . in",
    "what follows , we apply that scheme to bertrand duopoly problem and study the resulting game with respect to nash equilibria .",
    "next , we investigate the duopoly problem with the use of a simpler two - qubit scheme .",
    "let us recall the key elements of the li ",
    "massar scheme that are needed to consider the bertrand duopoly . in the original paper @xcite ,",
    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the quantum cournot duopoly are determined by the measurements @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the final state @xmath18 .",
    "formally , the final state is of the form : @xmath19 where    * @xmath20 is the entangling operator , @xmath21 * @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unitary operators @xmath25 that correspond to player @xmath26 s strategies , * operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath29 = \\delta_{ij } , ~[\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{i } , \\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{j } ] = [ \\hat{a}_{i } , \\hat{a}_{j } ] = 0.\\ ] ]    then the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are obtained by formula @xmath30 in what follows , we provide the reader with detailed calculation needed to obtain ( [ wynik1 ] ) .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the case  ( [ wynik2 ] ) .",
    "first , we recall the following operator relation that involves the function @xmath31 ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath32}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\sinh{\\gamma \\sqrt{\\beta}}\\ ] ] for operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 that satisfy @xmath35 = \\beta b$ ] , ( @xmath36 : constant ) . in a special case @xmath37 = \\mu\\mathbb{1}$ ] ( @xmath38 : constant ) ,",
    "formula  ( [ eidentity ] ) leads to @xmath39 from ( [ commutation ] ) and ( [ eidentity ] ) we have @xmath40 thus , we have @xmath41 applying  ( [ uproszczonyeidentity ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "therefore @xmath44 since , @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we thus get @xmath48 according to the theory of quantization of the electromagnetic field , operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfy relations @xmath51 hence @xmath52    we now apply the li  du",
    " massar scheme to the bertrand duopoly example . from a  game - theoretical point of view , the players 1 and 2 are to choose @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "then , the players prices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are determined as functions @xmath54 of @xmath55 and a fixed entanglement parameter @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( see @xcite and the papers directly related to bertrand duopoly - type problems for justifying formula  ( [ quantumprice ] ) in terms of quantum theory ) .",
    "substituting  ( [ quantumprice ] ) into ( [ bertrand1 ] ) and ( [ bertrand2 ] ) and noting that the sign of @xmath58 depends on the sign of @xmath59 we obtain the following quantum counterpart of ( [ bertrand1 ] ) and ( [ bertrand2 ] ) : @xmath60      in order to find all the nash equilibria , we determine the best reply functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 and find the points of intersection of the graphs of these functions . for @xmath63",
    "we have @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    ". then @xmath61 and @xmath62 coincide with the classical best reply functions ( [ classicalbestreply ] ) and ( [ classicalbestreply2 ] ) .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath66 .",
    "let us consider several cases to settle @xmath61 .    1 .   if @xmath67 , player 1 obtains a negative payoff by choosing @xmath68 . indeed , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "hence , according to  ( [ quantumu ] ) , it is optimal for player 1 to take @xmath71 . by a similar argument , if @xmath72 , then any @xmath73 yields player 1 a negative payoff .",
    "for this reason , player 1 s best reply is @xmath74 . in that case ,",
    "player 1 obtains the payoff of 0",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath75 .",
    "note that @xmath76 maximizes expression @xmath77 hence , if @xmath78 , term  ( [ expression ] ) as a function of variable @xmath79 is maximized at @xmath80 .",
    "however , equality @xmath81 implies that the players split the payoff given by  ( [ expression ] ) .",
    "thus , player 1 would benefit from choosing @xmath79 slightly below @xmath82 .",
    "but then any @xmath83 in between @xmath79 and @xmath82 would yield a better payoff . as a result",
    ", there is no best reply in this case .",
    "if @xmath84 then it follows from  ( [ haha ] ) that expression  ( [ expression ] ) is maximized at point @xmath85 .",
    "but by taking into account payoff function  ( [ quantumu ] ) , it would result in player 1 s payoff of 0 .",
    "thus , player 1 again obtains more by choosing @xmath79 slightly below @xmath82 . in the same manner as in case",
    "@xmath86 we can see that the set of best responses of player 1 is empty when @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath88 , then from the fact that @xmath89 maximizes  ( [ expression ] ) the player 1 s best reply is @xmath90 4 .   if @xmath91 , function  ( [ expression ] ) of variable @xmath79 is monotonically decreasing in interval @xmath92 . hence , player 1 would obtain the highest payoff if @xmath93 .",
    "5 .   for the case",
    "@xmath94 we have @xmath95 for any @xmath96 .",
    "it follows that @xmath97 , and then the set of best replies is @xmath92 .",
    "summarizing , we obtain the following best reply function @xmath61 : @xmath98 similar arguments to those above show that player 2 s best reply function @xmath62 is @xmath99 it is clear now that the players best reply functions  @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath100 are more complex compared with ( [ classicalbestreply ] ) . if @xmath101 the best reply functions on interval @xmath102 ( being the counterpart of case @xmath103 if @xmath104 ) are more specified , and take into account different intervals @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that new equilibria arise .",
    "since a nash equilibrium in a two - person game is a strategy profile in which the strategies are mutually best replies , we can easily determine the nash equilibria by studying the points of intersection of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see fig  1 for the graphs of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) .    ) and ( [ bestreplyq2 ] ) .",
    "[ figure1 ] ]    an example of such a point is profile @xmath108 that coincides with the unique classical nash equilibrium @xmath109 in case @xmath63 . another and more interesting example is a profile @xmath110 that implies the payoff profile @xmath111 and has no counterpart in the classical cournot duopoly .",
    "it is a particular case of a general equilibrium profile @xmath112.\\ ] ] to see that this type of nash equilibrium yields the payoff profile @xmath111 , note first that @xmath113 implies @xmath114 . from this",
    "we conclude @xmath115 as a result , player 2 s payoff is equal to zero and player 1 s payoff function @xmath116 comes down to @xmath117 since @xmath118 it follows that @xmath119 similarly , the set of nash equilibrium profiles @xmath120 is more profitable for player 1 . since @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 .",
    "hence , @xmath124 thus , there are continuum many nonclassical equilibria that favor player 1 .",
    "another part of equilibrium profiles favors player 2 ( see table 1 ) .",

    "@xmath138 may yield the player almost twice as high payoff . in this way , we can not obtain a symmetric equilibrium that would be profitable for both players . however , the correlation between prices can be defined in many different ways . in paper @xcite , we introduced a simplified model that correlate the players choices @xmath139 in the following way : @xmath140.\\ ] ] the value @xmath141 for @xmath142 is obtained by formula @xmath143 where    1 .",
