    "in a recent work @xcite a generalization of the bogoliubov transformation was introduced to treat confined boson field in space coordinates at finite temperature .",
    "the formalism is based on the thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) approach @xcite and has been applied to derive different aspects of the casimir effect for the electromagnetic field confined between two plates . in this context",
    "one interesting physical result is brought about : the casimir effect is described by a process of condensation , thus shedding a new ingredient on the nature  of the quantum vacuum . in this paper",
    "we extend the approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite  to fermion fields , and so we apply it to the casimir effect of a free massless fermionic field in a 3-dimensional box at finite temperature .",
    "the casimir effect was first proposed by taking into account the effect of the vacuum fluctuation of the electromagnetic field confined within two plates with separation @xmath4 , using the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the result was an attractive force between the plates given by the negative pressure @xmath5 ( we use natural units : @xmath6 ) @xcite . over the decades",
    "the effect has been applied to different geometries and physical conditions , enjoying a remarkable popularity @xcite and raising interest , in particular , in the context of microelectronics @xcite .",
    "the effect of temperature was first studied by lifshitz@xcite who presented an alternative derivation for the casimir force , including the analysis of the dielectric nature of the material between the plates .",
    "actually , the effect of temperature on the interaction between the conducting parallel plates may be significant for separations greater than @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "for this physical situation of plates , the full analysis of the thermal energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic  field was carried out by brown and maclay @xcite , performing the calculation of the casimir free - energy by using the green s function ( the local formulation ) written in a conformally invariant way @xcite .",
    "one of our proposal here is to derive the fermionic counterpart of the brown and maclay s formula , but for a more general situation of confinement : we consider not only the two plates , but also the case of confinement within an @xmath0-dimensional box .",
    "casimir effect for a massless fermionic field is of great interest in considering the structure of proton in particle physics ; thus its physical appeal .",
    "in particular , in the phenomenological mit bag model @xcite , quarks are confined in a small space region in such a way that there is no fermionic current outside that region .",
    "the fermion field then fulfills the so - called bag model boundary condition .",
    "the casimir effect in such a small region , of order @xmath8 is important to define the process of deconfinement in a heavy ion collision at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , giving rise to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the gluon field contribution for the casimir effect is , up to the color quantum numbers , the same as for the electromagnetic field . for the quark field",
    ", the problem has been often addressed only by considering the case of two parallel plates @xcite .",
    "actually , as first demonstrated by johnson @xcite , for plates , the fermionic casimir force is attractive as in the case of the electromagnetic field . on the other hand , depending on the geometry of the confinement ,",
    "the nature of the casimir force can change .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of a sphere and the casimir - boyer model , using mixed boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field , such that the force is repulsive@xcite .",
    "therefore , the analysis considering fermions in an euclidian wave - guide ( confinement in two - dimensions ) and in a 3-dimensional box ( confinement in 3-dimensions ) may be of interest .",
    "we avoid here the approach based on  the sum of quantum modes , that was so important in the calculation of the brown and maclay .",
    "using , alternately , the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we perform the calculation of the non - trivial problem of the quark field in a finite volume with the compactification in an @xmath0-dimensional box , at finite temperature .    in order to proceed with",
    ", we have to adapt the methodology of calculations discussed earlier @xcite , to encompass a generalized bogoliubov transformation for fermion fields with the mit bag model boundary condition ; equivalent to an antiperiodic boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this is presented in section 2 , where we derive the energy - momentum tensor for the fermion field at @xmath9 , resulting , as an example , in the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "this is the usual calculation of tfd for fermions ; however it can also be interpreted as a confinement in the time axis , in such a way that the field is under anti - periodic boundary conditions . using then this methodology for a euclidian geometry",
    ", we can envisage a space compactification .",
    "( in fact , this possibility has also been explored in the context of the matsubara formalism @xcite . ) the usual expression of the casimir effect is thus calculated , considering a proper modified bogoliubov transformation which will describe the confinement in the z - axis .",
    "the familiarity with this kind of calculation for these already known results will suggest to us a general form for a bogoliubov transformation to describe space compactification in arbitrary dimensions ; a subject developed in section 3 . in section 4 , we consider applications of the tensor derived in section 3",
    ". then we present the main result of this paper : the conformally invariant expression of the thermal energy - momentum tensor describing the casimir effect of a massless fermionic field confined in a 3-dimensional box .",
    "some particular situations are analyzed , resulting for instance that the attractive or repulsive nature of the casimir force can change in accordance with the rate among the sizes of the box .",
    "this situation is explicitly treated considering the case of wave guide obtained from a box of sizes @xmath10 such that @xmath2 and  @xmath11 in section 5 our concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the general approach to be used here can be addressed through the following prescription , taken as a generalization of the tfd formalism @xcite .",
    "given an arbitrary set of operators , say @xmath12 , with elements denoted by @xmath13 , there exists a mapping describing a doubling in the degrees of freedom defined by @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath15 satisfying the following conditions @xmath16 these properties are called _ the tilde ( or dual ) conjugation rules _ in tfd .",
    "the doubling in the hilbert space has a new vacuum denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "consider @xmath18 a set of @xmath19-numbers associated with macroscopic parameters of the system as such : temperature ( @xmath20 and three possible parameters describing the spatial confinement ( for instance the sizes @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of a box in space ) . then there exists a bogoliubov transformation given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "for an arbitrary operator in @xmath12 , we use the doublet notation @xcite    @xmath26    this kind of notation is useful to calculate the propagator for the confined field .    here we are concerned with the energy - momentum tensor for a massless fermionic field given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28|0\\rangle $ ] and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and the minkowski metric with a signature @xmath31 . with @xmath32 , we can introduce the confined ( @xmath33-)energy - momentum tensor @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a function of the field operators @xmath37,@xmath38 and @xmath39 the physical @xmath33-tensor is given by the component @xmath40 let us then work out this tensor .",

    "this is needed ( as in the case of bosons ) in order to fix the antiperiodic boundary conditions on the propagator , @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we calculate the casimir effect for the massless fermions within an @xmath0-dimensional ( space ) box at finite temperature .",
    "we proceed then by generalizing the results for the temperature and the casimir effect at zero temperature which were derived in the last section . supported by those calculations",

    "another aspect , worthy of noting , is the simplicity of calculations , that can be observed from the known results for the fermion casimir effect ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "this is so since we have avoided usual procedures , as the intricate method based on the sum of the quantum modes of the fields , satisfying some given boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , instead of the sum of modes , we have used the bogoliubov transformation to define the casimir effect as a kind of condensation procedure of the fermion field ( in a similar fashion as was carried out for the case of bosons@xcite ) .",
    "taking advantages of these practical proposals , the method developed here can be useful for calculations involving other geometries such as spherical or cylindrical symmetries .",
