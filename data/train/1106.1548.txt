    "in september 2001 , a workshop on  high rayleigh number convection \" was held at illmenau ( germany ) .",
    "during the course of this workshop , a controversy arose about the scaling and magnitude of the heat transport , in large prandtl number experiments .",
    "two groups , one in santa barbara @xcite , and one in hong kong @xcite , reported measurements performed in water and organic fluids ( alcohols ) at prandtl numbers ranging approximately @xmath11 to @xmath12 and in cell of aspect ratio unity . in these experiments , the non - dimensional heat transfer between the bottom and top , @xmath0 , appears to depend only weakly on the prandtl number , and to increase with the rayleigh number @xmath13 , like : nu=0.3 ra^0.28 pr^-0.028 .",
    "[ nusbhk ] a third group of people , located in rehovot , reported measurements performed with @xmath14 gas , near critical point . by varying the distance to critical point , one can vary the prandtl number between @xmath15 up to @xmath16 , with relatively small non - boussinesq effects up to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the heat transfer measurements in these experiments revealed a much stronger prandtl number dependence , and appeared to be about 1.5 larger in magnitude than in the water / alcohol experiments in the same range of rayleigh numbers : nu=0.51 ra^0.29 pr^-0.15 .",
    "[ nuasst ] since the aspect ratio in the @xmath14 experiments was comparable ( @xmath18 v.s .",
    "@xmath19 ) to the water / alcohol experiments , there was no clear explanation of the discrepancy between the two type of measurements .",
    "compressibility effects due to the vicinity of the critical point were mentioned as a possibility , even though simple estimates seem to rule out their influence in the range of rayleigh number explored @xcite . since then , the rehovot group has improved its method of determination of the nusselt number , which previously gave only precise estimate of _ relative _ changes , not absolute ones .",
    "the improvement results in a better determination of the prefactor of the law ( [ nuasst ] ) which appears to be decreased by a factor @xmath20 with respect to the old measurements ( steinberg , private communication ) .",
    "this solves the discrepancy in magnitude between the nusselt measurents in alcohol / water and in sf6 .",
    "but the discrepancy in the prandtl dependence still remains .",
    "clearly , in this type of controversy , it would be helpful to rely on theoretical results to guide our intuition .",
    "the water / alcohol experiments appear to be in good agreement with a recent theory by grossmann and lohse @xcite , which predicts a very weak decrease of the nusselt number with the prandtl number , due to a saturation of the viscous boundary layer ( it increases with @xmath1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath14 experiment is in excellent agreement with a theory by shraiman and siggia @xcite , based on the existence of a turbulent boundary layer .",
    "since both theories are mutually excluding , they can however not be used to solve the discrepancy . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "we have developed a quasi - linear theory of turbulent convection , which enables analytical predictions of the scaling laws of convection , including logarithmic corrections .",
    "the @xmath14 experiment appeared to fit nicely into one scaling regime , in which the energy dissipation is dominated by the fluctuations , while the heat dissipation is dominated by the mean flow .",
    "the theory of shraiman and siggia also appeared as a special case of this theory , in which both the energy and the temperature dissipation are dominated by mean quantities .",
    "so there are actually two regimes which could explain the @xmath14 experiment .",
    "it is then natural to wonder first which regime is the more suitable for explaining the @xmath14 and whether the quasi - linear theory can be used to propose solutions to the water / alcohol-@xmath14 controversy .",
    "this is the purpose of the present letter .",
    "in this context , it is interesting to summarize the main ideas behind the quasi - linear theory .",
    "this theory is first used to compute analytically , from the boussinesq equations , the mean and fluctuating velocity and heat profile within the turbulent boundary layer as a function of the rayleigh and prandtl numbers . under the assumption that the energy and temperature dissipation are controlled by the turbulent boundary layer",
    ", these results can then be used to evaluate them analytically as a function of the rayleigh and prandtl number . because this evaluation involves vertical integration of the local dissipation over the height of the turbulent boundary layer , the final result also becomes a function of the turbulent boundary layer scale . in the quasi - linear approximation , this scale can be computed by assuming that the velocity or thermal fluctuations are passively advected by the mean flow @xcite . however , because this mean flow a priori originates from the bulk ( it is external to the turbulent boundary layer ) , it can not be analytically computed and has to be taken as an external parameter .",
    "the number of degree of freedom can be greatly reduced if one assumes an algebraic profile @xmath21 for this mean flow .",
    "indeed , by matching this mean flow with the analytic expression within the boundary layer , the parameter @xmath22 becomes the only free relevant parameter of the problem . in @xcite , we used velocity profiles given by numerical simulations by kerr @xcite and verzicco and camussi @xcite to postulate that for @xmath23 , the parameter @xmath24 , while for @xmath25 , its value is @xmath26 .",
    "this difference then provides a natural explanation of the difference between low and large prandtl number measurements .",
    "also , because bulk circulation can be severely affected by the geometry of the container ( via the aspect ratio ) , it introduces a non - trivial dependence in the geometry which is difficult to quantify . in this regard , it is a weak point of the theory . on the other hand , we show below that the theory offers possibilities to connect different parameters of the convective cell independently of the bulk circulation , and depending only on the nature of the process which drives the dissipation ( i.e. whether it is the mean flow or the fluctuations ) .",
    "also , the hypothesis about the bulk flow contains several possibilities of direct check of the theory , via comparison between boundary layers length scales , and velocity profiles .",
    "indeed , it can be shown @xcite that the exponent of the velocity profile and the length scale of the boundary layers are related through : _ blt&=&pr^/(2+)u_^-(1+)/(2+)(+)^()/(2 + ) , + _ blv&=&()^(1+)/(2+)(+)^()/(2 + ) .",
    "[ resume ] here , @xmath27 is the friction velocity , and @xmath28 is equal to 1 if @xmath24 and zero elsewhere .",
    "all quantities have been non - dimensionalized by the vertical gap and the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the subscript @xmath29 stands for thermal , and @xmath30 stands for velocity boundary layer .",
    "the dependence of @xmath22 in @xmath31 and @xmath32 has been omitted for simpler notations .",
    "also , the logarithmic and constant velocity regime have been lumped into the single notation @xmath33 which patches the two consecutive characteristic behaviors .",
    "note that in these units , @xmath34 , the reynolds number based on the friction velocity has been added to differentiate this reynolds number from the reynolds number @xmath2 based on the large scale circulation , which will be introduced afterwards , and which is usually used in the scaling predictions . ] .",
    "equation ( [ resume ] ) then encompasses well - known relations . for @xmath24 ,",
    "one finds @xmath35 , like in a typical ( logarithmic , i.e. @xmath24 ) boundary layer . for @xmath36 , like in a laminar layer , one finds @xmath37 .",
    "this is the scaling originally proposed by shraiman and siggia @xcite .",
    "what would be the situation in large prandtl number convection ? because @xmath38 , it can be expected that small - scale temperature fluctuations , if any , are mainly affected by the laminar part of the velocity field . applying ( [ resume ] ) with @xmath36 , one then expect that the thermal boundary layer scales like @xmath39 . if the thermal fluctuations are so weak that only the mean temperature dominates the dissipation , then @xmath40 @xcite , fixing the link between @xmath41 and @xmath0 as : re_~nu^3/2 pr^-1/2 .",
    "[ general ] these laws are quite general , and independent of the shape of the velocity in the bulk region .",
    "we thus expect them to be universal laws of the large prandtl number regime .",
    "so , is it satisfied by the available measurements in both water / alcohol and @xmath14 ? in the sf6 case , there are no direct measurements available of the friction velocity reynolds number @xmath41 .",
    "instead , ashkenazi and steinberg @xcite provide measurements of a reynolds number based on the peak frequency @xmath42 from the velocity power spectra @xmath43 .",
    "it can be fitted by a power - law form @xmath44 . comparing the power - law form of @xmath0 and @xmath2 ,",
    "one then sees that the law ( [ general ] ) is very well satisfied provided @xmath45 , as already stressed in @xcite . in the alcohol case ,",
    "the hong - kong group measured @xmath46 .",
    "other direct measurements concern not the friction reynolds number , but the large scale reynolds number @xmath2 .",
    "its variation with @xmath1 and @xmath13 has been summarized by the hong kong group as : @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , this variation is very similar to the variation deduced in sf6 ( with a smaller prefactor , resulting in smaller reynolds numbers ) .",
    "however , given the very weak dependence of @xmath0 with @xmath1 , this measurements is clearly incompatible with ( [ general ] ) , which shows that in the alcohol case , either the equality @xmath45 does not hold , or / and the general law ( [ general ] ) is violated . in that respect , it is interesting to note that a direct measurements of @xmath41 performed by the same group , in a water experiment at @xmath48 for @xmath13 between @xmath49 to @xmath50 @xcite provides additional support of the violations of this laws .",
    "indeed , they found @xmath51 , while @xmath52 , closer to @xmath53 than to ( [ general ] ) .",
    "these interesting new scalings are reminiscent of measurements performed on the r.m.s .",
    "vertical velocity fluctuations by the rehovot group , which indicate that the corresponding reynolds number obeys a scaling transition from @xmath54 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , to a scaling @xmath57 at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the alcohol measurements show that our initial naive expectation gathered in ( [ general ] ) has to be refined .",
    "for this , let us come back to the main hypothesis governing ( [ general ] ) .",
    "it is based on the idea that the thermal boundary layer is determined by the balance between the large scale advection of temperature fluctuations @xmath59 and the heat dissipation @xmath60 . within the boundary layer ,",
    "the flow is laminar , oriented in the longitudinal direction and obeys the friction law @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the vertical coordinate @xcite . to obtain a `` typical '' velocity advection ,",
    "one then sets @xmath63 to get @xmath64 .",
    "this argument does not take into account the constraint that the typical size of the boundary layer can not increase beyond the size of the box @xcite .",
    "this effect is obtained when the whole cell is laminar , i.e. as the reynolds number decreases . to take this into account ,",
    "we may then change our estimate into @xmath65 , resulting into the more general law : = , [ general2 ] where @xmath66 is a constant depending a priori on the aspect ratio .",
    "decreasing @xmath41 ( e.g. by increasing @xmath1 as in the experiment of ashkenazi and steinberg ) , one observes a transition from @xmath67 ( i.e. the naive law ( [ general ] ) ) to @xmath68 .",
    "large scale circulations are easier to measure than friction velocities .",
    "its is therefore interesting to connect @xmath2 and @xmath41 to be able to exploit and verify ( [ general2 ] ) . for this",
    ", we match the large scale circulation velocity @xmath6 to the velocity @xmath69 at the top of the boundary layer . at large reynolds number , the boundary layer is turbulent and @xmath70 ( within logarithmic corrections ) . at smaller reynolds number , the boundary layer is laminar and @xmath71 .",
    "the link between @xmath2 and @xmath41 then depends on the shape of the velocity in the bulk flow ( through the value of @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , we may note that this length - scale is also subject to the condition that it can not increase beyond the size of the box @xcite ( a situation occurring at very low reynolds numbers ) .",
    "this remarks allows us to build a general law resulting from a patching between the large reynolds number case and the very low reynolds number case as : re = c_1 , [ reynoldsun ] where @xmath72 is a non - universal constant and @xmath73 is a critical reynolds number . a rough estimate of this two parameters can be made using the alcohol data of xia and collaborators .",
    "the available measurements unfortunately only concern @xmath0 and @xmath2 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , in this low reynolds number case , we expect @xmath74 .",
    "using this , we may then find @xmath72 and @xmath73 by a two parameter fit of @xmath2 versus @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows a comparison of the measured @xmath2 and the fit using ( [ reynoldsun ] ) with @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory .",
    "a further test of this fit can be made by comparing the effective boundary layer lentgh scale @xmath77 with the direct measurement of xian and xia @xcite in water ( @xmath48 ) and alcohol , giving @xmath78 .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] that the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "finally , one can invert ( [ reynoldsun ] ) to obtain @xmath41 as a function of @xmath2 in the sf6 experiment , using the values of the parameters calibrated from the alcohol experiment .",
    "the results is shown in fig .",

    "the line is a fit @xmath81 , a behavior predicted by the theory . ]",
    "the combination of ( [ reynoldsun ] ) and ( [ general2 ] ) predicts that , for a given ( large ) @xmath1 , large reynolds number leads to @xmath82 , while at lower reynolds number , @xmath83 . in between",
    ", there is a transitional regime in which @xmath2 varies smoothly with @xmath41 . for the range of reynolds numbers explored by the hong - kong group",
    ", we checked that this corresponds to an apparent scaling behavior @xmath84 .",
    "the first case is representative of the data by ashkenazi and steinberg , while the second is representative of the data by xia and collaborators , and ahlers and collaborators .",
    "it seems therefore that we have identified a possible cause of discrepancy between the two groups : the difference in magnitude in the reynolds number , resulting in a different regime explored .",
    "this difference of reynolds number , observed in experiments with similar aspect ratios , prandtl numbers and rayleigh numbers is surprising at first sight .",
    "a first explanation is that compressibility effects do play a role .",
    "a second explanation is that for this range of parameters , there are two possible solutions , with distinct transport properties ( leading to different large - scale circulations and different nusselt numbers ) .",
    "note that a similar phenomenon has recently be observed in the flow between two coaxial rotating cylinders ( the von karman flow ) . in a certain range of reynolds number ,",
    "the mean component of the turbulent flow undergoes a global bifurcation with three distinct flow configurations , characterized by different transport properties , and subject to a strong hysteresis @xcite .",
    "is one of these two explanations sufficient to explain the difference in prandtl number dependence observed ? to answer this question , we now focused on the second ingredient of @xcite : the energy dissipation , enabling to link @xmath2 , and @xmath13 and @xmath0 .      in @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the contribution to the energy dissipation scales like @xmath85 for a laminar mean flow , @xmath86 for a turbulent mean flow ( larger reynolds number ) , and like @xmath87 for fluctuations .",
    "the first two contributions can be patched together as a function of the reynolds number in a way similar to what we did for the reynolds number .",
    "summing the contributions of the mean flow and of the fluctuations ( in a way similar to a procedure adopted by grossmann and lohse @xcite ) and recalling that this energy dissipation equals @xmath88 @xcite , we obtain in this framework a general relation linking @xmath41 and the other parameters : pr ra ( nu-1)=c_1 pr^3 + c_2 ( pr nu)^3/2 ra^1/2 ln _ blv/_blv^2 , [ dissipation ] where @xmath72 and @xmath89 are ( a priori non universal ) constants . using ( [ general2 ] ) , this relation can also be written in a more illuminating form as : = c_1 re_^2 + c_2 ln _ blv/_blv^2 .",
    "[ dissipationbo ] this relation can be used to determine interesting scaling properties independent of the bulk flows or of the geometry .",
    "indeed , we note that @xmath32 is a function of @xmath41 ( see ( [ resume ] ) ) .",
    "further , we see from ( [ general2 ] ) that at low reynolds number @xmath41 is a function only of @xmath3 . considering ( [ dissipationbo ] ) at low reynolds , this means that in this regime @xmath3 and @xmath2 are function only of @xmath4 .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the fact that the dissipation is dominated by the mean flow or by the fluctuations . in practice ,",
    "since @xmath0 is close to @xmath8 and @xmath2 close to @xmath90 , this corresponds to a very weak dependence of @xmath0 with @xmath1 , and a dependence @xmath91 for @xmath2 . at large reynolds number",
    ", @xmath41 is a function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite . inserting this into ( [ dissipationbo ] )",
    ", we see that at large reynolds number , @xmath94 is a function only of @xmath95 ( within logarithmic corrections ) , or equivalently @xmath5 is a function only of @xmath7 . for @xmath0 and @xmath2 close to a @xmath8 and @xmath90 dependence , this means a decrease of @xmath0 like @xmath96 ( within logarithmic corrections ) and of @xmath2 like @xmath97 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath0 in that regime is therefore stronger than in the low reynolds number regime , and qualitatively explains the difference between the experiments in sf6 and in alcohol / water . for a quantitative agreement , one would need to evaluate the constants @xmath72, .. @xmath89 appearing in ( [ dissipationbo ] ) and ( [ general2 ] ) .",
    "one possibility would be to perform a non - linear fit of the experimental data points , like @xcite . in the sequel",
    ", we would like to explore another possibility , based on a collapse method inspired from finite size scaling in statistical mechanics .",
    "equation ( [ dissipationbo ] ) , valid in both the large and low reynolds number regime , provides an interesting implicit equation for the variable @xmath98 : y^2= c_1",
    "re_^2 + c_2 y ln _ blv/_blv^2 .",
    "[ dissipationbo2 ] the function @xmath99 can be found once the functional shape for @xmath32 is provided . in the sequel",
    ", we shall adopt _",
    "blv^-1=1+c_3 r_^1/3 , [ patchlambda ] patching between the large reynolds number case , and the saturation expected at very low reynolds number .",
    "our goal is now to determine the constants @xmath100 and @xmath73 from the available data . for this",
    ", we remark that as @xmath101 , @xmath102 and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath103 is : y^2=c_1 re_^2,pr .",
    "[ asymptotic ] note that given ( [ general ] ) , this corresponds to @xmath104 , a limiting law also found by ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , experimental data indicate that in the range of parameters usually explored , the behavior of @xmath0 with @xmath13 and @xmath1 follows approximate power laws .",
    "this suggests that it should be possible to approximate the behavior of @xmath103 at large but finite prandtl number via a scaling shape ( reminiscent of finite size scaling in statistical mechanics ) : y^2=c_1 re_^2 f(re_pr^ ) , [ fsize ] where @xmath105 is a scaling exponent ( equivalent to a critical exponent ) and @xmath106 is a ( universal ) scaling function . in this approximation",
    ", the two parameters ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) can be found experimentally from a collapse procedure on the data taken at different @xmath1 and @xmath41 .",
    "this procedure is described below .",
    "we stress that since the scaling form is not exactly satisfied by the theoretical formula ( [ dissipationbo ] ) , it will only provide an approximate experimental verification of ( [ dissipationbo2 ] ) .",
    "however , since this method uses data in different experimental set ups ( different @xmath1 and @xmath41 ) , it is less liable to systematic experimental errors and thus , provides a more robust estimate of the constants @xmath107 than via a direct fit of the data .",
    "in addition , it provides a strong independent test of the theoretical formula ( [ dissipationbo2 ] ) since it does not use its functional shape _",
    "a priori_.      in recent convection experiments , the quantity @xmath41 is usually not directly measured and we have to use only an estimate of it , based on ( [ general ] ) . to minimize the error introduced by this procedure , we may rewrite ( [ asymptotic ] ) as : y pr^=g(re_pr^ ) , [ direct ] with @xmath108 .",
    "the determination of @xmath105 and @xmath109 is then made by trial and error , plotting @xmath110 as a function of @xmath111 , and choosing @xmath105 of that all curves , corresponding to different measurements at different @xmath1 and @xmath2 , collapse onto a single curve .",
    "the resulting curve is the scaling function @xmath109 .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] present the best collapse obtained with @xmath112 for the data collected by the groups of ahlers ( santa barbara ) , xia ( hong - kong ) and steinberg ( rehovot ) . in the first two cases , we used @xmath113 . in the third case",
    ", we used @xmath114 .",
    "interestingly enough , the scaling function seems to possess two branches at intermediate reynolds number ( one extending the ahlers data , the other one extending the steinberg data ) .",
    "note that among the data of steinberg and his group , part of the data do fall onto the lowest branch corresponding to the ahlers data . to check whether this is an artefact of our method , or whether it corresponds to a real physical process ( like bimodality of the nusselt numbers , discussed in @xcite , we ran an additional check .",

    "moreover , the range where our bimodality was detected appears to coincide with the bimodality range of chavanne et al .",
