    "based on light - curves analysis of several hundreds type ia supernovae [ 1,2 ] , observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation by the wmap satellite [ 3 ] and other cmb - based experiments [ 4,5 ] , it has been revealed that our universe is currently in a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "some authors have attributed this late - time expansion of the universe to an energy component referred to as _",
    "dark energy_. the simplest example in this regard is the cosmological constant itself which provides a model of dark energy .",
    "however , it is unfavorable since it requires a huge amount of fine - tuning [ 6 ] .",
    "phantom fields [ 7 ] , quintessence [ 8 ] and modification of gravitational theory itself [ 9,10 ] are other attempts to explain this late time expansion of the universe . in the spirit of the modified gravitational theory , carroll _",
    "et al _ have proposed @xmath2 modification of the usual einstein - hilbert action [ 11 ] .",
    "it was then shown that this term could give rise to accelerating solutions of the field equations without dark energy .",
    "on the other hand , theories of extra spatial dimensions , in which the observed universe is realized as a brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years . in this framework ,",
    "ordinary matters are trapped on the brane but gravitation propagates through the entire spacetime [ 9,12,13 ] .",
    "the cosmological evolution on the brane is given by an effective friedmann equation that incorporates the effects of the bulk in a non - trivial manner [ 14 ] . from a cosmological view point ,",
    "the importance of brane models lies , among other things , in the fact that they can provide an alternative scenario to explain the late - time accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "theories with extra dimensions usually yield correct newtonian limit at large distances since the gravitational field is quenched on sub - millimeter transverse scales .",
    "this quenching appears either due to finite extension of the transverse dimensions [ 12,15 ] or due to sub - millimeter transverse curvature scales induced by negative cosmological constant [ 13,16 - 19 ] .",
    "a common feature of these type of models is that they predict deviations from the usual 4-dimensional gravity at short distances .",
    "the model proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) [ 9 ] is different in this regard since it predicts deviations from the standard 4-dimensional gravity even over large distances . in this scenario",
    ", the transition between four and higher - dimensional gravitational potentials arises due to the presence of both the brane and bulk einstein terms in the action . in this framework ,",
    "existence of a higher dimensional embedding space allows for the existence of bulk or brane matter which can certainly influence the cosmological evolution on the brane .",
    "even if there is no 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert term in the classical theory , such a term should be induced by loop - corrections from matter fields [ 20,21 ] .",
    "generally one can consider the effect of an induced gravity term as a quantum correction in any brane - world scenario .",
    "+ a particular form of bulk or brane matter is a scalar field .",
    "scalar fields play an important role both in models of the early universe and late - time acceleration .",
    "these scalar fields provide a simple dynamical model for matter fields in a brane - world model . in the context of induced gravity corrections",
    ", it is then natural to consider a non - minimal coupling of the scalar field to the intrinsic ( ricci ) curvature on the brane that is a function of the field .",
    "the resulting theory can be thought of as a generalization of brans - dicke type scalar - tensor gravity in a brane - world context .",
    "in contrast to common belief , the introduction of non - minimal coupling ( nmc ) is not a matter of taste ; nmc is instead forced upon us in many situations of physical and cosmological interest .",
    "there are many compelling reasons to include an explicit non - minimal coupling in the action .",
    "for instance , nmc arises at the quantum level when quantum corrections to the scalar field theory are considered . even if for the classical , unperturbed theory this nmc vanishes , it is necessary for the renormalizability of the scalar field theory in curved space . in most theories used to describe inflationary scenarios ,",
    "it turns out that a non - vanishing value of the coupling constant can not be avoided .",
    "in general relativity , and in all other metric theories of gravity in which the scalar field is not part of the gravitational sector , the coupling constant necessarily assumes the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the study of the asymptotically free theories in an external gravitational field with a gauss - bonnet term shows a scale dependent coupling parameter .",
    "asymptotically free grand unified theories have a non - minimal coupling depending on a renormalization group parameter that converges to the value of @xmath3 or to any other initial conditions depending on the gauge group and on the matter content of the theory .",
    "an exact renormalization group study of the @xmath4 theory shows that nmc@xmath5 is a stable infrared fixed point .",
    "also in the large @xmath6 limit of the nambu - jona - lasinio model , we have nmc@xmath5 . in the @xmath7- symmetric model with @xmath8",
    ", nmc is generally nonzero and depends on the coupling constants of the individual bosonic components .",
    "higgs fields in the standard model have nmc@xmath9 or @xmath3",
    ". only a few investigations produce zero value(for a more complete discussion of these issues we refer to papers by v. faraoni , specially ref . [ 22 ] and references therein ) . in view of the above results , it is then natural to incorporate an explicit nmc between scalar field and ricci scalar in the inflationary paradigm and in quintessence models . in particular",
    "it is interesting to see the effect of this nmc in a dgp - inspired braneworld cosmology .",
    "there are several studies focusing on the braneworld models with scalar field [ 22 - 31 ] .",
    "some of these studies are concentrated on the bulk scalar field minimally [ 23 - 25 ] or non - minimally[26 - 28 ] coupled to the bulk ricci scalar . some other authors have studied the minimally [ 29,30 ] or non - minimally [ 22,31 ] coupled scalar field to the induced ricci scalar on the brane .",
    "however , none of these studies have considered consequences of embedding of frw cosmology with non - minimally coupled brane - scalar field into dgp scenario explicitly . specifically , none of these studies obtained five dimensional metric components and full dynamics of the braneworld within this scenario trivially .",
    "in addition , there are very limited literature on late time behavior and quintessence with non - minimally coupled scalar field and even these studies have not performed explicit and detailed calculation of the late - time dynamics .",
    "+ in this paper , in the spirit of dgp inspired gravity , we study the effect of an induced gravity term which is an arbitrary function of a scalar field on the brane .",
    "we present four - dimensional equations on a dgp brane with a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the induced ricci curvature , embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski bulk .",
    "this is an extension to a braneworld context of scalar - tensor ( brans - dicke ) gravity .",
    "we show that our model allows for an embedding of the standard friedmann cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric on the brane can entirely be described by the standard friedmann equation plus energy non - conservation on the brane . in this framework",
    "we explore the relation between our formalism and the so - called dark radiation formalism .",
    "we study cosmological implications of both minimal and non - minimal extension of our model . in minimal case , motivated by modified theories of gravity ,",
    "the potential describing minimally coupled scalar field is taken to be that with @xmath2 term added to the usual einstein - hilbert action[11 ] . in non - minimal case",
    "however , we concentrate mainly on the potential of the type @xmath10 .",
    "we study the weak field limit of our model and show that the mass density of ordinary matter on the brane should be modified by the addition of the effective mass density attributed to the non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane .",
    "considering the case of frw brane , we obtain the evolution of the metric and scalar field by solving the field equations in the limit of small curvature . our solutions for minimal case predict a power - law acceleration on the brane supporting observed late - time acceleration .",
    "for non - minimal case ( by adapting a simple ansatz ) we show that by a suitable choice of non - minimal coupling and scalar field potential one can achieve accelerated expansion in some special cases .",
    "we study quintessence model with non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane and discuss some observational constraints imposed on the value of the non - minimal coupling using supernova data .",
    "+ we use a prime for differentiation with respect to fifth coordinate except for two special cases : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the comoving time , @xmath13 .",
    "the action of the dgp scenario in the presence of a non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane can be written as follows @xmath14-\\frac{1}{2 } q^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_{\\mu}\\phi\\nabla_{\\nu}\\phi -v(\\phi ) + m^{3}_{4}\\overline{k}+ { \\cal{l}}_{m}\\bigg)\\bigg]_{y=0},\\ ] ] where we have included a general non - minimal coupling @xmath15 in the brane part of the action ( for an interesting discussion on the possible schemes to incorporate nmc in the formulation of scalar - tensor gravity see [ 22,35 ] ) .",
    "@xmath16 is coordinate of the fifth dimension and we assume brane is located at @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is five dimensional bulk metric with ricci scalar @xmath19 , while @xmath20 is induced metric on the brane with induced ricci scalar @xmath21 . @xmath18 and @xmath20 are related via @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is trace of the mean extrinsic curvature of the brane defined as @xmath24_{y=-\\epsilon}+ \\big[k_{\\mu\\nu}\\big]_{y=+\\epsilon}\\bigg),\\ ] ] and corresponding term in the action is york - gibbons - hawking term[32 ] ( see also [ 20 ] ) .",
    "the ordinary matter part of the action is shown by lagrangian @xmath25 where @xmath26 is matter field and corresponding energy - momentum tensor is @xmath27 the pure scalar field lagrangian , @xmath28 , yields the following energy - momentum tensor @xmath29 the bulk - brane einstein s equations calculated from action ( 1 ) are given by @xmath30 @xmath31\\delta(y ) = { \\delta_{a}}^{\\mu}{\\delta_{b}}^{\\nu}\\upsilon_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta(y),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is 4-dimensional(brane ) dalembertian and @xmath33 .",
    "this relation can be rewritten as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 is total energy - momentum on the brane defined as follows @xmath36 from ( 6 ) we find @xmath37 and @xmath38 for bulk and brane respectively .",
    "the corresponding junction conditions relating the extrinsic curvature to the energy - momentum tensor of the brane , have the following form @xmath39^{y=+\\epsilon}_{y=-\\epsilon } = \\frac{1}{m_{4}^{3}}\\bigg[{\\cal{t}}_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{3}q_{\\mu\\nu}q^{\\alpha\\beta } { \\cal { t}}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\bigg]_{y=0 } -\\frac{m^{2}_{3}\\alpha(\\phi)}{m^{3}_{4}}\\bigg[r_{\\mu\\nu}- \\frac{1}{6}q_{\\mu\\nu}q^{\\alpha\\beta}r_{\\alpha\\beta}\\bigg]_{y=0}.\\ ] ]    we set @xmath40 where @xmath41 are small perturbations to investigate the weak field limit of the scenario . within the gaussian normal coordinate , we impose the following harmonic gauge on the longitudinal coordinates[9 ] @xmath42 this will led us to a decoupled equation for the gravitational potential of a static mass distribution .",
    "the transverse equations in the gauge ( 11 ) give @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the remaining equations take the following form @xmath45.\\ ] ] we suppose that non - minimally coupled scalar field has an effective mass @xmath46 .",
    "the gravitational potential of mass densities @xmath47 and @xmath48 on the brane satisfies the following equation @xmath49 this equation shows that in the presence of non - minimally coupled scalar field , the mass in standard dgp framework should be modified by the addition of the mass of the non - minimally coupled scalar field . using the following fourier ansatz @xmath50\\ ] ] in equation ( 13 ) , we find @xmath51 this integral equation has the following solution @xmath52 the resulting potential on the brane is @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and the _ sine _ and _ cosine _ integrals are defined as follows @xmath55 now there is a modified transition scale @xmath56 between four and five - dimensional behavior of the gravitational potential in this scenario : @xmath57,\\ ] ] and @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is euler s constant .",
    "therefore , existence of non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane has the following consequences : the mass density of ordinary matter on the brane should be modified by the addition of the mass density attributed to the scalar field on the brane and the dgp transition scale between four and five dimensional behavior of gravitational potential now is explicitly dependent on the strength of non - minimal coupling .",
    "if @xmath15 varies slightly from point to point on the brane , it can be interpreted as a spacetime dependent newton s constant .",
    "the dynamics that control this variation are determined by the following equation @xmath60 note that in the real world we do nt want @xmath15 to vary too much since it will have observable effects in classic experimental tests of general relativity and also in cosmological tests such as primordial nucleosynthesis[33 ] .",
    "this can be ensured either by choosing a large mass for scalar field @xmath61 or choosing @xmath15 so that large changes in @xmath61 give rise to relatively small changes in newton s constant .",
    "so , when @xmath15 varies in dgp brane from point to point , the crossover scale will change and is no longer a constant .",
    "this feature would change previous picture of crossover scale in dgp scenario and my change some arguments on phenomenology of this scenario[34 ] . note that we can define a modified four - dimensional planck mass as @xmath62 and therefore the effect of non - minimal coupling",
    "can be attributed to the modification of four dimensional planck mass .",
    "this is equivalent to modification of four dimensional newton s constant[22 ] . if we use the reduced planck mass for @xmath63 , gravitational potential for small @xmath64 limit will differ from the ordinary four - dimensional potential by a factor @xmath65 .",
    "in fact the coupling of the masses on the brane to the induced ricci tensor on the brane is modified by this factor .",
    "existence of this extra factor is in agreement with the tensorial structure of the graviton propagator due to additional helicity state of the five - dimensional graviton [ 9,34 ] .",
    "figure @xmath66 shows the shape of the dgp potential for @xmath67 ( equation ( 19 ) ) with some arbitrary values of the nmc . as this figure shows , for large negative values of nmc , it is possible to have repulsive gravitational potential . for positive values of nmc",
    "the dgp potential for @xmath67 is always attractive .",
    "figure @xmath68 shows the dgp potential for @xmath69 ( equation ( 20 ) ) . +    ignoring the tensor structure ,",
    "the gravitational potential of a source of mass @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 for @xmath67 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 respectively .",
    "that is , the potential exhibits four - dimensional behavior at short distances and five - dimensional behavior ( i.e. , as if the brane were not there at all ) at large distances . in the absence of nmc , for the crossover scale to be large , we need a substantial mismatch between four - dimensional planck scale ( corresponding to the usual newton s constant , @xmath74 ) and the fundamental , or bulk , planck scale @xmath75 [ 34 ] .",
    "however , with nmc @xmath15 , evidently @xmath76 can be large with large values of @xmath15",
    ". therefore existence of nmc changes the mismatch condition between four - dimensional planck scale and the fundamental planck scale . in minimal case ,",
    "the fundamental planck scale @xmath75 has to be quite small in order for the energy of gravity fluctuations to be substantially smaller in the bulk versus on the brane , the energy of the latter being controlled by @xmath77 .",
    "this situation can be mediate due to the presence of nmc .",
    "note that when @xmath75 is small , the corresponding newton s constant in the bulk , @xmath78 , is large .",
    "so , for a given source mass @xmath70 , gravity is much stronger in the bulk .",
    "earlier work using supernova data implies that the best - fit for density parameter of ordinary matter is given by @xmath79 [ 41,42 ] .",
    "we may introduce a new effective dark energy component , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 to resort the identity : @xmath82 .",
    "therefore we find @xmath83 . assuming a flat universe , a more recent supernova data [ 43 ] suggests a best - fit of @xmath84 corresponding to a best - fit crossover scale @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath86 or @xmath87 , for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we find @xmath90 .",
    "it has been shown that dgp model can account for the standard friedmann cosmology at any distance scale on the brane [ 20 ] . in our proposed framework , we start with the following line element to derive cosmological implications of our model , @xmath91 in this relation @xmath92 is a maximally symmetric 3-dimensional metric defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 parameterizes the spatial curvature and @xmath95 .",
    "we assume that scalar field @xmath61 depends only on the proper cosmic time of the brane .",

    ", this relation can be rewritten as follows @xmath212 finally , using ( 72 ) , this can be written as @xmath213 this is a general condition to have an accelerating universe with non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane [ 22,35 ] . to proceed further ,",
    "we assume weak energy condition @xmath214 .",
    "motivated from several theoretical evidences ( for example : conformal coupling in general relativity and other metric theories[35 ] , renormalization group study of @xmath215 theory[36 ] and large @xmath6 limit of the nambu - jona - lasinio model[37 ] , ( see also [ 22 ] and references therein ) , in which follows we set @xmath216 with @xmath217 .",
    "therefore we find @xmath218 as an example , suppose that @xmath219 .",
    "in this case with @xmath217 and using ( 81 ) , we find @xmath220 if we assume a positive scalar field potential with @xmath221 , the condition for accelerating expansion restricts @xmath222 to the values which @xmath223 .",
    "so in the presence of non - minimally coupled scalar field , it is harder to achieve accelerating universe with usual potentials .",
    "now with above definitions of non - minimal coupling and scalar field potential , equations ( 70 ) and ( 71 ) take the following forms @xmath224,\\ ] ] and @xmath225=0.\\ ] ] in order to study late time behavior of these equations , we try the following ansatz , @xmath226 where we have assumed a decreasing power law ansatz for scalar field . with these choices and",
    "setting @xmath227 , equation ( 83 ) gives @xmath228 on the other hand , equation ( 84 ) gives @xmath229t^{-\\mu-2}+4\\lambda b^{3 } t^{-3\\mu}=0.\\ ] ] considering terms of order @xmath230 , equation ( 86 ) gives @xmath231 if we require a positive and real @xmath232 .",
    "so for this special ansatz @xmath222 is restricted to the condition @xmath233 . with the same procedure , equation ( 87 )",
    "gives @xmath234 again , positivity and reality of solutions for @xmath235 lead to the following constraint @xmath236 where for @xmath237 and taking equality , we find @xmath238 which plus sign obviously leads to an power - law accelerated expansion .",
    "so , we conclude that although in the presence of non - minimally coupled scalar field , accelerated expansion of universe is harder to achieve relative to minimally coupled scalar field case , but with a suitable choice of nonminimal coupling it is possible to explain this accelerated expansion .",
    "+ on the other hand , with a nonminimal coupling of the kind @xmath239 , we can define @xmath240 where @xmath241 . in order to connect to our present universe , @xmath242 needs to be positive for the case of the positive @xmath222 , which yields @xmath243 .",
    "when @xmath222 is negative , such a constraint is absent . by performing a conformal transformation[40 ] to transform to the einstein frame",
    ", we define @xmath244 figure @xmath245 shows the behavior of this effective potential with different values of nonminimal coupling and @xmath198 defined in ( 74 ) . as we see , when @xmath222 is positive , since the potential @xmath246 is flat in the region of @xmath247 compared with the @xmath248 case , we can expect assisted inflation ( due to nmc ) to occur in this region .",
    "when @xmath222 is negative , assisted inflation can be realized in the region of @xmath249 .",
    "+    based on some holographic dark energy model , the value of nmc , @xmath222 to have an accelerated universe is restricted to the interval @xmath250[44 ] . on the other hand , current experimental limits on the time variation of @xmath251 constraint the nonminimal coupling as @xmath252[45 ] .",
    "solar system experiments such as shapiro time delay and deflection of light[33 ] have constraint brans - dike parameter to be @xmath253 .",
    "this constraint leads to the result of @xmath254 for non - minimal coupling [ 45 ] .",
    "to study quintessence model within our setting , we write the equation of state for scalar field which takes the following form @xmath255 causality implies that @xmath256 . when @xmath257 , we obtain @xmath258 . in this case",
    "@xmath162 is independent of @xmath259 and @xmath198 plays the role of a cosmological constant . if @xmath260 , we find @xmath261 in the case of minimal coupling ( @xmath262 ) this is corresponding to a massless scalar field which plays the role of a _ stiff matter _ since @xmath263",
    "however , in our case with non - minimally coupled scalar field , the situation is very different since now @xmath264 plays a crucial role and depending on the form of @xmath264 we may obtain some traces of stiff matter or fail to have such extreme case .",
    "so , in principle our model provide a mechanism to avoid stiff matter .",
    "in the minimal case when @xmath265 , we obtain @xmath266 which shows a late - time accelerating universe . in this case , since @xmath267 and@xmath268 , the following potential which is a liouville - type potential , decreases when scalar field @xmath61 increases and therefore gives the required quintessence @xmath269 where @xmath270 . on the other hand , for non - minimal case we find @xmath271 in this case",
    "the quintessence potential has an explicit dependence on the non - minimal coupling and its derivatives with respect to @xmath61 . to have a quintessence model",
    ", we should impose some limits on the shape of this non - minimal coupling .",
    "since based on quintessence proposal the dark energy of the universe is dominated by the potential of scalar field , we should impose suitable constraints on non - minimal coupling such that scalar field potential decrease when scalar field increases .",
    "we assume ordinary matter on the brane has energy density @xmath272 and vanishing pressure @xmath273 .",
    "now total energy density becomes @xmath274 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for acceleration of the universe , @xmath275 , leads to the following relation @xmath276 which can be written as @xmath277 this is a general constraint to have a quintessence scenario in the presence of non - minimal coupling .",
    "if we assume that @xmath278 and @xmath162 are non - negative , with @xmath216 and @xmath217 , we find @xmath218 to have quintessential expansion , this constraint with @xmath279 , restrict the form of scalar field potential to potentials @xmath280 where @xmath281\\bigg]<0 $ ] where @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 and @xmath285 has been approximated by its present value[22 ] .",
    "so , to have a quintessential expansion with non - minimal coupling with @xmath286 we need a potential that does not grow faster than @xmath287 with variation of @xmath61 .",
    "an inverse - power - law potential such as @xmath288 , an exponential potential such as @xmath289  and several other possibilities[38,39 ] provide suitable potentials for quintessence .",
    "but obviously quintessence model in the presence of non - minimal coupling needs more artificial arguments than minimal case .",
    "in this paper we have considered the dgp model with a non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane . as we have explained , the introduction of non - minimal coupling is not just a matter of taste ; it is forced upon us in many situations of physical and cosmological interests such as quantum corrections to the scalar field theory and its renormalizability in curved spacetime . in the spirit of dgp",
    "inspired gravity , we have studied the effect of an induced gravity term which is an arbitrary function of a scalar field on the brane .",
    "we have presented four - dimensional equations on a dgp brane with a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the induced ricci curvature , embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski bulk .",
    "this is an extension to a braneworld context of scalar - tensor ( brans - dicke ) gravity .",
    "cosmological implications of both minimal and non - minimal extension of our model are studied . in minimal case ,",
    "we have considered an exponentially decreasing potential which has been motivated by modified theory of gravity with @xmath2 modification . in the non - minimal case however , we have considered potential of the type @xmath10 .",
    "we have studied the weak field limit of our model and it has been shown that the mass density of ordinary matter on the brane should be modified by the addition of the effective mass density attributed to the non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane . also in this case crossover scale of dgp scenario is modified by the presence of non - minimal coupling .",
    "we have discussed the role of nonminimal coupling in crossover distance .",
    "considering the case of frw brane , we have obtained the evolution of the metric and scalar field by solving the field equations in the limit of small curvature .",
    "our solutions for minimal case predict a power - law acceleration on the brane supporting observed late - time acceleration . for non - minimal case",
    "we have shown that by a suitable choice of non - minimal coupling and scalar field potential one can achieve accelerated expansion in some special cases . however , as faraoni has shown , in the presence of non - minimally coupled scalar field accelerated expansion of universe is harder to achieve relative to minimally coupled scalar field case .",
    "we have studied quintessence model in our framework and it has been shown that for a restrict class of non - minimal coupling one can achieve quintessence potential . as an important achievement",
    "our analysis shows that dgp model allows for an embedding of the standard friedmann cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric on the brane can entirely be described by the standard friedmann equation plus energy non - conservation on the brane .",
    "as we have shown , our model gives dark energy extension of friedmann equation more easily than standard framework .",
    "some observational and experimental constraint on nonminimal coupling are discussed .",
    "the issue of non - minimal inflation on warped dgp braneworld and confrontation with wmap3 data will be reported in a separated paper[46 ] . + * acknowledgement * + it is a pleasure to appreciate members of the centre for particle theory at durham university , specially professor ruth gregory for hospitality during my sabbatical leave .",
