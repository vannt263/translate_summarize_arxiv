    "oceanic internal waves are the waves whose restoring force is buoyancy in stratified fluid .",
    "these waves are excited by flows over topography , tides and atmospheric disturbances .",
    "the energy of the waves is then transferred by nonlinear interactions among wavenumbers from large scales to small scales , and is dissipated in the small spatial scales by wave breaking .",
    "internal waves play a significant role in the general circulation of oceans and hence the climate of the earth .",
    "energy spectra of internal waves are vast with horizontal wavelengths varying from @xmath0 meters to @xmath1 meters , vertical wavelengths from @xmath0 meters to @xmath2 meters , and time periods from @xmath2 seconds to @xmath1 seconds .",
    "the complexity of the internal - wave fields arises not only from its extended range of scales , but also from their interactions with the other major players in ocean dynamics including eddies , mean currents and shear flows .",
    "the main dynamical role of the internal waves is to store energy and transfer it across different scales and large distances .",
    "hence the waves constitute a large and complex geosystem containing a broad range of interacting scales and affecting significantly most of the active players in ocean dynamics .",
    "however , surprisingly and despite all the complexities , energy spectra of the internal waves in the oceans appear to be somewhat universal .",
    "it is given by the garrett ",
    "munk ( gm ) spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the internal - wave spectrum may be a result predominantly , if not exclusively , of nonlinear interactions among waves .    in this paper",
    "we test the hypothesis by direct numerical simulations of the reduced model of stratified rotating turbulence .",
    "our model contains only wave modes of stratified wave turbulence , and completely excludes vortices and horizontally uniform vertical shears . despite these simplifications",
    ", our numerical model reproduces some key features of spectral energy density observed in the oceans .    as a result of appearance of the gm spectrum , internal waves in the ocean",
    "have been a subject of active research ever since .",
    "an important milestone was a review by @xcite .",
    "it focuses on the resonant wave - wave interaction theory , called the weak turbulence theory .",
    "the result of the review is that the resonant wave - wave interactions in the stratified wave turbulence are dominated by specific , `` named '' nonlocal wave - wave interactions in the wavenumber space .",
    "the classification of the `` named '' nonlocal interactions appeared first in @xcite .",
    "since then it was understood that in the oceans local spectral energy density may change owing to the propagation of energy from other parts of the ocean as well as owing to the nonlinear wave - wave interactions .",
    "a useful and intuitive diagram in the wavenumber space that separates the two regions appear in @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed modification of the gm spectra to take into account the dependence of the characteristic depth as a function of frequency @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite developed a novel hamiltonian structure for waves in stratified flows that we use below for our numerical modeling .",
    "historical observational data were reviewed in @xcite , where major deviations from the gm spectrum were categorized .",
    "useful phenomenological characterization of fluxes of energy in internal waves were put forward by @xcite .",
    "however , the gm spectrum stood the test of time and still stands as the canonical model of the internal - wave spectral energy density .",
    "the gm spectrum is a function of the frequency @xmath3 and the vertical wavenumber @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is rather hard and expensive to measure the spectrum as a function of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at least in the 1970 s , when the series of the gm spectra are published @xcite ,",
    "only one - dimensional spectra were generally available ( with the exception of the iwex experiment ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 was obtained from time series of mooring current meters and @xmath7 from vertical profilers .",
    "furthermore the large wavenumber limit of @xmath7 has @xmath8 dependency .",
    "garrett and munk proposed that the spectrum is _ separable _ , that is the product of a function of @xmath3 and a function of @xmath4 : @xmath9 then @xmath6 and @xmath7 were properly normalized and chosen so that the resulting spectrum matches experimentally measured one - dimensional @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra .",
    "the resulting spectrum is given by eq .",
    "( [ gm ] ) below .",
    "the assumption of the separability allows one to construct a function of two arguments , @xmath5 out of two one - dimensional functions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , if one relaxes the assumption , there is more than one way to obtain the two - dimensional spectrum , @xmath10 , to fit the observed one - dimensional spectra , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , it recently became quite apparent that the assumption ( [ separable ] ) is not satisfied in the oceans @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations also demonstrate that the assumption ( [ separable ] ) is not satisfied uniformly .",
    "it also appears in our direct numerical simulations that resulting energy spectra do not display universal behavior .",
    "rather , our simulations demonstrate accumulation of energy around the horizontally longest waves .",
    "furthermore , we argue based on our direct numerical simulations that the energy spectrum in the inertial subrange is determined by nonlocal interactions with the accumulation .",
    "the nonlocal interaction in the wavenumber space is one of the `` named '' nonlocal interactions identified by @xcite . as a result of the nonlocal interactions , the details of behavior of the stratified wave turbulent system depends upon details of the accumulation .",
    "consequently the resulting energy spectra are non - universal in our numerical experiments .    despite apparent non - universality and non - separability of spectral energy density in the inertial subrange",
    ", our simulations do exhibit certain key features that are observed in the ocean .",
    "namely , our simulations have clear peaks at inertial frequencies which correspond to the accumulation of energy , as observed in the ocean .",
    "our largest numerical simulation does demonstrate the @xmath11 dependence of the energy spectrum that appears prominently in moored observations .",
    "furthermore our simulation demonstrate realistic @xmath12 dependence on the horizontal wavenumbers .",
    "the behavior of the spectra in the inertial subrange , formation of accumulation , apparent non - universality and violation of separability ( [ separable ] ) can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of the nonlocal `` named '' interactions .",
    "these findings support observationally - based intuition that spectral energy density of internal waves is formed primarily by the nonlinear wave - wave interactions .",
    "the stratified rotating _ wave _ turbulence is a subset of a much more complicated subject of rotating stratified strong turbulence governed by the navier  stokes equation .",
    "complexities of the rotating stratified strong turbulence appear owing to coexistence of waves , shears and vortices and their interactions .",
    "the rotating and stratified strong turbulence has been a subject of intensive research in last few decades .",
    "extensive numerical studies of rotating turbulence , stratified turbulence and turbulence with both rotations and stratification were performed @xcite .",
    "accumulation of energy at the horizontally largest scales were reported in direct numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the accumulation in the rotating strong turbulence happens presumably owing to the inverse cascade of two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "in contrast , in the stratified rotating turbulence , the resonant wave - wave interactions commonly cause the accumulation of energy at the horizontal largest scales .",
    "we emphasize that the rotating stratified wave turbulence is dominated by nonlocal wave - wave interactions in the wavenumber space .",
    "anisotropic wave turbulence systems often exhibit nonlocal interactions : drift wave turbulence , rossby waves and mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "the scenario is in contrast to the local interactions of isotropic wave turbulence systems . in the locally interacting systems",
    "the spectra are insensitive to the details of large - scale and small - scale motions , and are the results of the local interactions among wavenumbers .",
    "examples of the locally interacting systems include waves on water surfaces .",
    "in particular , universal behavior was observed in direct numerical simulations of gravity - wave and capillary - wave systems @xcite .",
    "note that isotropic navier  stokes turbulence is also widely believed to be a locally interacting system .",

    "the hamiltonian description appeared in  @xcite and is presented here for completeness .",
    "our model explicitly excludes vortices and horizontally uniform shear flows . despite the simplification",
    ", the resulting spectrum does display some key features that are observed in the ocean .    as a starting point , we take the equations of motion satisfied by an incompressible stratified rotating flow in hydrostatic balance under the boussinesq approximation : @xmath13 these equations are derived from mass and horizontal - momentum conservations and hydrostatic balance .",

    "here we introduced @xmath26 to be a normalized differential layer thickness .",
    "the potential vorticity is conserved along particle trajectories . since the fluid density is also conserved along the trajectories , an initial profile where the potential vorticity is a function of the density",
    "will be preserved by the flow .",
    "hence any initial chosen profile will stay in the fluid all the time .",
    "this observation allows us to propose that @xmath27 here @xmath28 is a reference stratification profile defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the buoyancy ( brunt  visl ) frequency , which we shall regard as a constant @xmath31 .    in order to separate wave and vorticity dynamics",
    ", we decompose the fluid velocity into its gradient and rotational parts , i.e. @xmath32 the vorticity is derived from the potential vorticity and is distinct from the vorticity in cartesian coordinates . in terms of the potentials",

    "we do realize that the oceans are more complicated than these idealizations . certainly for general ocean modeling the above assumptions",
    "constitutes a gross simplification .",
    "the reason for our choice is that we would like to find out whether it is sufficient to study wave - wave interactions alone to determine the form of the internal - wave spectral energy density .",
    "we show below that this is indeed the case to a large extent .",
    "we show that our reduced model reproduces key characteristic behavior of the oceans .",
    "the effects of relaxing the above assumptions is the subject of future work .",

    "the wave turbulence theory provides a powerful framework to describe spectral energy transfer in the systems dominated by wave - wave interactions .",
    "a detailed review of the wave turbulence theory and its applications to internal waves is outside of the scope of the present paper , and is given in @xcite .",
    "here it is sufficient to note that there are the following important classes of scale - separated resonant interactions among waves @xcite :    * the vertical backscattering of a high frequency wave by a low frequency wave of twice the vertical wavenumber into a second high frequency wave of oppositely signed vertical wavenumber .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to achieve non - equilibrium statistically ( near-)steady states , we have to model both processes of pumping energy to the internal - wave field and of damping energy from the field .",
    "the processes of the pumping include interactions with surface waves and tides .",
    "how to model these processes in the wavenumber space is the subject of present oceanographic research .",
    "we model the pumping processes phenomenologically .",
    "in what follows we assume that the pumping occurs on large length scales , and is relatively local in the wavenumber space .",
    "the processes that remove energy from the wave field include wave breaking , turbulent dissipation , reflection from surface and bottom boundary layers and interaction with topography .",
    "again , the spectral details of the processes is a subject of intensive research .",
    "we assume that the processes are especially effective for small length scales ( large wavenumbers ) .    in our numerical simulations ,",
    "most of the energy provided by the external forcing accumulates around the horizontally longest waves owing to nonlinear interactions among waves .",
    "the horizontally longest waves have frequencies near the inertial frequency @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the waves are called `` near - inertial waves . ''",
    "then the energy is transferred through the inertial subrange , where there is no significant pumping or damping .",
    "note that the inertial subrange therefore refers to the range in wavenumber space without effective forcing and damping , while the near - inertial waves refers to the waves with the near - inertial frequency .",
    "subsequently energy is absorbed in the dissipation range .",
    "it is the nonlinear interactions among internal waves that determine the form of the spectrum in the inertial subrange and the formation of accumulation of energy at the near - inertial waves .",
    "the nonlinear interactions among waves is the main focus of the present paper .    in the direct numerical simulations , we add external forcing and hyper - viscosity to the canonical equation ( [ eq : canonical ] ) .",
    "thus the dynamic equation used in the simulations is given by @xmath61 details of numerical algorithm are the following : the linear terms , i.e. a linear dispersion term and a dissipation term , @xmath62 , are explicitly calculated .",
    "the nonlinear terms , @xmath63 , are derived from the nonlinear parts of the canonical equation ( [ eq : canonical ] ) with hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "they are obtained numerically by a pseudo - spectral method with the phase shift under the periodic boundary conditions for all three directions .",
    "the external forcing , @xmath64 , is implemented by fixing the amplitudes of several small wavenumbers to be constant in time .",

    "of gm spectrum as the initial condition ( upper ) and of energy spectrum after about 35 hours ( bottom ) of run i. significant differences in the region @xmath119 indicates that gm spectrum is not statistically steady . ]",
    "since the gm spectrum was believed to be the universal oceanographic spectrum , the natural question to ask is whether the gm spectrum could be a steady state of our numerical wave model .",
    "we realize that such a guess may be far - fetched , but it is nevertheless appealing to check it .",
    "therefore we are led to examine statistical stability of the gm spectrum .",
    "we assume that the steady state of the ocean can be characterized by an energy flux from pumping regions to damping regions in the wavenumber space . therefore",
    "to achieve a truly steady state we need to model both pumping processes and damping processes .",
    "as explained above , in modeling the damping we use traditional hyper - viscosity approach in eq .",
    "( [ hyper ] ) . as we will see below",
    ", the resulting spectrum depends upon the large - scale flows .",
    "therefore , the only way to see whether the gm spectrum is close to being a steady state that is independent of the form of the pumping is to choose no pumping at all .",

    "the initial phases of complex amplitude , @xmath44 , are given by uniformly distributed random numbers in @xmath120 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gm_ns ] shows the initial spectrum and the energy spectrum after about 35 hours in ocean time . if the gm spectrum were to be a universal steady state of our numerical model , it would change very little in this simulation . instead",
    ", the density exponents rapidly change from @xmath121 to @xmath122 only after @xmath123 days .",
    "this spectral change occurs faster than dissipation effects with timescale estimated to be about 50 days at @xmath124 .",
    "therefore it appears that the gm spectrum is not a stable universal spectrum in the wavenumber region @xmath125 at least for this particular numerical experiment .",
    "the behavior of numerical experiment appears to contradict the arguments of @xcite based on induced diffusion approach that all energy spectra are rapidly relaxed to the gm spectrum , but is consistent with @xcite .",
    "we certainly realize that our numerical model of run i may not fully describe the ocean .",
    "then we question what could be the nature of the statistical steady state of our wave model of stratified rotating turbulence . here",
    "we model the pumping phenomenologically .",
    "we assume that waves are forced at horizontally and vertically large scales , i.e. small wavenumbers .",
    "in particular we choose the forced wavenumbers such that @xmath126 the forcing is modeled by fixing the amplitude of the forced wavenumbers to be constant in time .",
    "we also added an additional external dissipation @xmath127 for @xmath128 in these runs to avoid violation of the hydrostatic balance .",
    "detailed investigation of the non - hydrostatic effects is outside of the scope of present paper .",
    "since the energy flows in the wavenumber space strongly depend on the inertial frequencies @xmath19 @xcite , we performed run ii and iii with differing values of the inertial frequencies @xmath19 ( see table  [ table : parameters ] ) . for run ii , the inertial frequency @xmath129 rad / sec , while for run iii the value of the inertial frequency is @xmath130 rad / sec .",

    "the runs also demonstrated largely non - separable spectra .",
    "it also appears that the energy spectrum in @xmath87 space is more separable than in @xmath88 space .",
    "this is at odds with oceanic intuition .",
    "we also observed realistic @xmath12 spectrum in run ii .",
    "furthermore , the formation of the inertial peak is qualitatively consistent with a `` named '' nonlocal interaction , which is the parametric subharmonic instability .",
    "it also appears that the integrated vertical - wavenumber spectrum is highly sensitive to the accumulation at the horizontally longest waves .",
    "finally , the integrated frequency spectra can not be fitted by power laws due to the forcing at multiple frequencies .",
    "run iv is the freely decaying run with the gm spectrum without the small wavenumbers as initial conditions .",
    "this run demonstrates that the internal - wave statistical properties are strongly affected by the nonlocal interactions with the small wavenumbers . in particular",
    ", removing the small wavenumbers from the initial condition produces a significantly different outcome .",
    "thus , the energy transfer in the inertial subrange is qualitatively explained by the induced diffusion .",
    "run v also demonstrates that energy accumulates at the horizontally longest near - inertial waves .",
    "this is consistent with runs ii and iii as well as the ocean .",
    "it also appears that the two - dimensional spectrum is more separable in @xmath88 space than in @xmath87 space .",
    "this is consistent with observationally - based intuition .",
    "furthermore , the integrated frequency spectrum of run v is given by @xmath11 , consistent with the ocean .",
    "similarly , the integrated horizontal - wavenumber spectrum @xmath12 is also consistent with the observations .",
    "however , the integrated vertical - wavenumber spectrum do not show the power - law exponent consistent with the observations .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that the integrated vertical - wavenumber spectrum is determined by the accumulation at the near - inertial waves .",
    "the near - inertial waves may be much affected by processes not considered in this manuscript .",
    "* energy tends to accumulate at the horizontally longest waves i.e. near - inertial waves * to a lesser degree , some energy was observed in the small vertical wavenumbers .",
    "* spectra in the inertial subrange are not completely separable * realistic integrated horizontal @xmath12 spectrum is observed * realistic integrated frequency @xmath11 spectrum is observed * the integrated vertical - wavenumber spectrum is determined exclusively by the near - inertial waves * the spectrum in the inertial subrange is largely determined by the interactions with the near - inertial waves . *",
    "the accumulation of energy of the near - inertial waves and the spectrum in the inertial subrange could qualitatively be described by `` named '' nonlocal interactions .    the stratified rotating turbulence governed by the navier  stokes equation and its relation with the ocean will of course be further researched and debated .",
    "here we address the reduced wave - wave numerical model of stratified rotating turbulence with the hope that it could shed light on processes in oceans and its spectral energy density in particular .",
    "it appears that this reduced model reproduce key features of spectral energy density of oceanic internal waves .",
    "this supports observationally - based intuition that the spectral energy density of internal waves is described predominantly by the wave - wave interactions .",
    "the future will certainly bring many further exciting developments , and the synthesis of theoretical , observational and numerical results yet to be obtained .",
