    "it is well known that models with 3 - 3 - 1 gauge symmetries predict flavor violating interactions in both quark and lepton sectors , since all the charged fermions mass matrices can not be assumed diagonal in any case @xcite . on the other hand , it has been confirmed that neutrinos are massive particles and that there is mixing in the leptonic charged current @xcite . in the context of the standard model ( sm ) , the massive neutrinos",
    "imply that the charged currents are non - diagonal and they are parametrized by the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , which has been measured in several neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the sm there is no mechanism for generating neutrino masses neither the pmns matrix .",
    "hence , it is necessary to search extensions of the sm that implement a mechanism for solving both issues , keeping at the same time compatibility with the data of lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes .    here",
    "we will implement a mechanism for generating lepton masses and the pmns matrix in the context of the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 ( m331 ) model in which the left - handed lepton families transform as triplets @xmath4 under the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we will also study the phenomenological effects of such mechanism in some lfv processes like @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we will work in the context of the non - trivial sm limit of our model obtained when we impose @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , being @xmath11 and @xmath12 the masses of the respective lightest @xmath13 neutral and @xmath14 charged vector bosons , corresponding to the @xmath15 and @xmath14 gauge bosons in the sm . under this condition ,",
    "all couplings of the known fermions to @xmath13 are the same as the respective couplings of these fermions to @xmath15 in the sm , and the exotic quarks couplings to @xmath13 and @xmath16 depend only on the electroweak angle @xmath17 . in the m331 model , in which the lepton sector includes only the known leptons",
    ", this condition fixes the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in terms of @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath18 only @xmath19 remains free . here",
    "@xmath20 is related to the standard electroweak scale , and @xmath21 is the vev of the neutral component of the sextet which contributes to the charged lepton masses , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the vevs of the triplets that contribute to the quark masses , but @xmath24 also may contribute to the charged lepton masses .",
    "analysis of the quark sector assuming ( [ solution ] ) was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , there was assumed that the vevs of the triplets @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "hence , @xmath21 was considered negligible and for this reason the sextet is not enough , as we will show below , to give the correct mass to the charged leptons using only renormalizable yukawa interactions . notice that this fixes three otherwise almost arbitrary vevs ( in gev ) : @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . however",
    ", since the degrees of freedom of the sextet are still there and may be heavy , they can induce the dimension five effective operator given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for these reasons",
    "it is necessary to add to the m331 model , three sterile neutrinos .",
    "see more details in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .    the m331 model has doubly charged vector and scalar bileptons , generically denoted by @xmath29 , with interactions that violate the individual lepton flavor number by single or two units , for instance @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "hence , in this models the decays @xmath32 ( the three leptons may be all different ) and @xmath33 are allowed and can be used to constraint the masses of the bileptons once the unitary matrices , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , needed to diagonalize the lepton matrices , are fixed .",
    "in fact , these processes are prediction of this sort of model  @xcite .",
    "these flavor violation processes in the m331 model were considered many years ago by liu and ng  @xcite .",
    "however , at that time almost nothing was known about the lepton mixing and neutrino masses . here",
    "we will take into account this new information and also consider the effects of the neutral higgs bosons which in this model have non - diagonal interactions in the flavor space .",
    "we stress that even if neutrinos were massless ( at tree level ) the lepton flavor number is not conserved in this model . here",
    "we will not consider neither @xmath36 violation , however see  @xcite .",
    "generally , in models with fcnc the unitary matrices , @xmath34 and @xmath37,that are needed to diagonalize the mass matrix in each charged sector , survive in different places of the lagrangian when it is written in terms of the mass eigenstates fields .",
    "for instance , in the present model , besides the @xmath38 matrix in the lepton sector we have interactions with the doubly charged vector bilepton field that involve @xmath39 , and with doubly charged scalars with @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a symmetric matrix of yukawa couplings .",
    "for this reason , we first fit all of these unitary matrices by getting the known masses and mixing matrices in the interactions with @xmath42 and only then study the phenomenological consequences constraining the masses of the extra particles in the model .    in the absence of a compelling model",
    "new physics effects can be parametrized by using effective interactions in which all operators of a given dimension are classified .",
    "for instance , effective operators which violate flavor , baryon and lepton numbers can be used in a model independent way .",
    "these operators depends on the unitary matrices above and on an energy scale , @xmath43 , which characterizing the new physics and is larger than the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , we have a well behaved model and all new interactions are formulated using only renormalizable interactions , since even the effective interactions used for generating the charged lepton masses arising as a consequence of fundamental yukawa interactions of leptons with the sextet .",
    "moreover , even if effective operators are used to fit the unitary matrices and the @xmath43 scale , eventually we have to verify if these unitary matrix entries obtained in this way , do correctly diagonalize the respective fermion masses .    our main result ,",
    "using the strategy discussed above , i.e. , first fit all unitary matrices , is that the strongest constraint on the doubly charged vector bilepton @xmath44 , comes from @xmath3 .",
    "we will show that unlike processes in the quark sector  @xcite in leptonic processes the scalar contributions are supressed .",
    "this sort of models predict also flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in the scalar sector , thus we consider also @xmath8 , at tree level , in a situation in which there is no more free parameters in the yukawa coupling since all of them are already fixed when we obtain the matrices @xmath45 , the pmns mixing matrix and lepton masses .",

    "there are only left - handed neutrinos and they are naturally majorana particles .",

    "an @xmath57 antisymmetric matrix has the eigenvalues @xmath58 , therefore , to adjust the mass of charged leptons , the largest contribution would have to come from the symmetric matrix , plus a minor contribution from the antisymmetric matrix .",
