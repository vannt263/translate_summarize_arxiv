    "satisfy @xmath13 it is easy to see that @xmath14 when @xmath15 , and @xmath16 if and only if the derivative @xmath17 .",
    "three values of @xmath9 correspond to spaces that have been studied extensively and are often defined in terms of integrability :    * @xmath18 corresponds to _ the bergman space @xmath19 _ , consisting of functions with @xmath20 * @xmath21 corresponds to _ the hardy space @xmath22 _ , consisting of functions with @xmath23 * and @xmath24 corresponds to the usual _ dirichlet space @xmath25 _ of functions @xmath0 with @xmath26    a description similar to that of the dirichlet space , in terms of an integral , is possible for the @xmath27 spaces for @xmath28 indeed , @xmath29 if and only if    @xmath30    this expression can be used to define an equivalent norm for @xmath29 , which we use in section [ s - gradient ] .",
    "we refer the reader to the books @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for in - depth treatments of hardy and bergman spaces ; recent surveys concerning the dirichlet space @xmath25 include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a function @xmath29 is said to be _ cyclic _ in @xmath27 if the closed subspace generated by polynomial multiples of @xmath0 , @xmath31=\\overline{\\textrm{span}\\{z^kf\\colon k=0,1,2,\\ldots\\}},\\ ] ] coincides with @xmath1 .",
    "note that cyclicity in @xmath27 implies cyclicity in @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",

    "since polynomials are dense in @xmath27 , we have @xmath38=d_{\\alpha}$ ] .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that an equivalent ( and more useful ) condition for the cyclicity of @xmath0 is that there exist a sequence of polynomials @xmath39 such that @xmath40 we note that for certain values of @xmath9 , the multiplier spaces of @xmath1 are relatively easy to determine . for @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 , and when @xmath43 the multiplier space coincides with @xmath1 itself ( see @xcite ) .    in general",
    ", it is not an easy problem to characterize cyclic functions in a space of analytic functions .",
    "however , a complete answer to the cyclicity problem for @xmath22 ( the case @xmath21 ) is given by a theorem of beurling ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) : @xmath0 is cyclic if and only if @xmath0 is an outer function . in particular , a cyclic function @xmath44 can not vanish in @xmath8 . in the bergman space ,",
    "the situation is considerably more complicated ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) .",
    "a common feature of all @xmath1 is that cyclic functions have to be non - vanishing in @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath43 , to be non - vanishing in the _ closed _ unit disk , or equivalently , @xmath45 is a necessary and sufficient condition ( see @xcite ) for cyclicity .",
    "however , when @xmath46 , functions may still be cyclic if their zero set on the boundary , that is , the unit circle @xmath47 , is not too big . here",
    ", we define the zero set in an appropriate sense via , for instance , non - tangential limits .    in @xcite , l. brown and a.l .",
    "shields studied the phenomenon of cyclicity in the dirichlet space .",
    "in particular , they established the following equivalent condition for cyclicity : @xmath0 is cyclic in @xmath1 if and only if there exists a sequence of polynomials @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and , pointwise as @xmath50 , @xmath51 brown and shields also obtained a number of partial results towards a characterization of cyclic vectors in the dirichlet space @xmath25 .",
    "their starting point was a result of beurling , stating that , for any @xmath52 , the non - tangential limit @xmath53 exists _ quasi - everywhere _ , that is , outside a set of logarithmic capacity zero .",
    "brown and shields proved that if the zeros of @xmath54 , @xmath55 form a set of positive logarithmic capacity , then @xmath0 can not be cyclic . on the other hand",
    ", they also proved that @xmath56 is cyclic for any @xmath57 and showed that any polynomial without zeros in @xmath8 is cyclic .",
    "hence , they asked if being outer and having @xmath58 is sufficient for @xmath0 to be cyclic .",
    "this problem remains open and is commonly referred to as the _ brown - shields conjecture _ ; see however @xcite for recent progress by el - fallah , kellay , and ransford , and for background material .",
    "subsequent to the brown and shields paper , brown and cohn showed ( see @xcite ) that sets of logarithmic capacity zero do support zeros of cyclic functions , and later brown ( see @xcite ) proved that if @xmath59 is invertible , that is @xmath60 , then @xmath0 is cyclic .",
    "however , there are cyclic functions @xmath0 for which @xmath61 , e.g. @xmath62",
    ".    the problem of cyclicity in @xmath25 has been addressed in many papers .",
    "an incomplete list includes @xcite , where sufficient conditions for cyclicity are given in terms of bergman - smirnov exceptional sets ; the paper @xcite , where these ideas are developed further , and examples of uncountable bergman - smirnov exceptional sets are found ; and @xcite where multipliers and invariant subspaces are discussed , leading , for instance , to a proof that non - vanishing univalent functions in the dirichlet space are cyclic .      in this paper , we set out to improve understanding of cyclicity by studying certain classes of cyclic functions in detail .",
    "many of the results in this paper are variations of the following questions : given a cyclic function @xmath29 , can we obtain an explicit sequence of polynomials @xmath48 such that @xmath63 can we give an estimate on the rate of decay of these norms as @xmath64 ?",
    "what can we say about the approximating polynomials ?",
    "a natural first guess is to take @xmath48 as the taylor polynomials of the function @xmath65 . since @xmath65 is analytic in @xmath8 by the cyclicity assumption , we have @xmath66 pointwise , and",
    "hence is satisfied .",
    "however , it may be the case that norm boundedness in fails .",
    "this is certainly true for the taylor polynomials @xmath67 in the case @xmath62 ; indeed , @xmath68 and a computation shows that @xmath69    much of the development that follows is motivated by our goal of finding concrete substitutes for the taylor polynomials of @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath70 .",
    "we say that a polynomial @xmath2 of degree at most @xmath5 is an",
    "_ optimal approximant _ of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 if @xmath2 minimizes @xmath3 among all polynomials @xmath4 of degree at most @xmath5 .",
    "we call @xmath6 the _ optimal norm _ of degree @xmath5 associated with @xmath0 .    in other words , @xmath71 is an optimal polynomial of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 if @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath5 and @xmath74 for any normed space @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "notice that , given @xmath78 , the existence and uniqueness of an optimal approximant of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 follows immediately from the fact that @xmath79 is a finite dimensional subspace of the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is cyclic if and only if the optimal approximants @xmath2 of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 satisfy @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath82 it follows from and that @xmath0 is cyclic if and only if the sequence of optimal approximants @xmath39 converges pointwise to @xmath65 .    in section [ s - gradient ] , we describe a constructive approach for computing the coefficients of the optimal approximant of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 for a general function @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , theorem [ t - linear ] below states that the coefficients of the optimal approximants can be computed as ratios of determinants of matrices whose entries can be explicitly computed via the moments of the derivative of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 itself is a polynomial , these matrices are banded ( see proposition [ t-2tdiagonal ] ) . as a simple but fundamental example",
    ", we compute optimal approximants to the function @xmath65 when @xmath62 .",
    "we are also interested in the rate of convergence of optimal norms .",
    "since optimal norms decay exponentially for any function @xmath0 such that @xmath65 is analytic in the closed unit disk , functions that have zeros on the unit circle are of particular interest . in section [ optimalnormbounds ] , we examine the question of whether all functions with no zeros in the open unit disk but with zeros on the boundary , admitting an analytic continuation to the closed disk , have optimal norm achieving a similar rate of decay . in theorem",
    "[ optimalrate ] , we prove that this is indeed the case .    in section [ log ]",
    ", we deal with a generalization to all @xmath27 of a subproblem of the brown - shields conjecture .",
    "we ask the question whether a function @xmath0 satisfying @xmath70 and @xmath83 , must be cyclic in @xmath27 .",
    "we note that this is true in the simple cases of @xmath84 or @xmath43 . in theorem [ solvelog ] we are able to answer affirmatively in the case @xmath24 .",
    "then , theorem [ cyclic1 ] shows that for the case @xmath85 the same holds with an additional technical condition .",
    "we do not know if this condition is necessary ; however , it is satisfied by a large class of examples , namely , all of the functions constructed in brown - cohn ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude , in section 5 , by presenting some open questions and basic computations connected to the zero sets @xmath86 of the optimal approximants @xmath2 of @xmath65 for cyclic functions @xmath0 .",
    "the optimal approximants @xmath2 of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 are determined by the fact that @xmath87 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath88 onto the space @xmath89 , and hence , in principle , if @xmath78 , they can be computed using the gram - schmidt process .",
    "more precisely , once a basis for @xmath89 is chosen , one can construct an orthonormal basis for @xmath79 and then compute the coefficients of @xmath2 with respect to this orthonormal basis .    in this section , we present a simple method which yields the optimal approximants @xmath2 without the use of the gram - schmidt process , for @xmath90 . to that end , we make use of the integral norm of @xmath1 , namely , @xmath91 where @xmath92 was defined in .    recall that we seek an explicit solution to    _ problem 1 . _",
    "let @xmath93 . given @xmath78 such that @xmath94 , @xmath95      as mentioned in section [ s - plan ]",

    "it follows that if the optimal approximant of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 vanishes at the origin , then @xmath101 is minimal if and only if @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , we may assume without loss of generality that the optimal approximant @xmath71 of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 does not vanish at the origin . by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath103",

    "hence , under this latter assumption , @xmath107 is the optimal approximant of order @xmath5 to @xmath65 if and only if @xmath108 is the unique solution to    _ problem 2 . _",

    "therefore , there exist constants @xmath406 and @xmath407 such that @xmath408 as desired .    the methods used in the proofs of theorems [ distforpol ] and [ optimalrate ] yield an independent proof of the upper bound for the optimal norm in the dirichlet space ( the case @xmath24 ) , valid for a class of functions with the property that the fourier coefficients of @xmath0 and of @xmath65 exhibit simultaneously rapid decay .",
    "more specifically , if @xmath409 denotes the sequence of taylor coefficients of a function @xmath52 and @xmath410 denotes the coefficients of @xmath65 , we say that @xmath0 is a _ strongly invertible function _",

    "( in fact , much more is true ; @xmath413 . )",
    "that is , strongly invertible implies invertible in the dirichlet space , and such functions are known to be cyclic ( see @xcite , p.  274 ) , and are therefore of interest . by defining polynomials analogous to those at the end of section 2 ,",
    "namely , @xmath414 one can use the stronger condition on the decay of the coefficients of @xmath65 to prove a version of the control lemma [ fundamental ] with the coefficients @xmath415 and then one can obtain the conclusion of theorem [ optimalrate ] for these strongly invertible functions . in particular , it can be shown that the following holds .",

    "then there exist polynomials @xmath418 of degree at most @xmath5 for which @xmath419 .",
    "it would be natural to investigate whether these riesz - type polynomials provide close to optimal approximants for more general functions , in particular functions of the form @xmath420 , when @xmath421 .",
    "another interesting question would be whether the rate of decay that we have observed for functions admitting an analytic continuation to the closed disk holds for other functions that vanish precisely on the same set .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath0 is invertible in the hardy or dirichlet space , then @xmath0 is cyclic in that space .",
    "in addition , it is easy to see that if both @xmath0 and @xmath65 are in @xmath27 and @xmath0 is bounded then @xmath422 but the converse does not hold .",
    "the condition that @xmath83 can be thought of as an intermediate between @xmath70 and @xmath423 .",
    "indeed , @xmath83 is equivalent to @xmath424 being a @xmath425 function . on the other hand , @xmath426 if and only if @xmath427 while @xmath423 if and only if @xmath428 . we therefore want to study the following question :    [ prob1 ] is any function @xmath70 , with logarithm @xmath429 , cyclic in @xmath27 ?    in several cases the statement is true : if @xmath430 or @xmath84 , and @xmath70 with its logarithm @xmath431 , then @xmath0 is cyclic in @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath430 , @xmath83 implies @xmath432 , which is equivalent to the cyclicity of @xmath0 ( see p.  274 of @xcite ) . for @xmath21 ,",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath433 then @xmath434 and therefore @xmath0 is outer , that is , cyclic in @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the logarithmic condition implies the following interpolation result , valid for all @xmath90 .",
    "[ interpolation ] suppose @xmath29 and @xmath435 .",
    "then , for any @xmath436 $ ] , we have @xmath437 and consequently , @xmath438 .    it suffices to establish the bound on @xmath439 . to this end , we write @xmath440 and the resulting integrals can be bounded in terms of @xmath441 and @xmath442 , as claimed .",
    "this lemma allows us to show that for a function @xmath0 in the dirichlet space @xmath25 , corresponding to the case @xmath24 , the condition @xmath443 does imply the cyclicity of @xmath0 .",
    "the proof relies on the following theorem due to richter and sundberg ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 ) and let @xmath444 be lebesgue measure ) .    if @xmath59 is an outer function , and if @xmath445 is such that @xmath446 , then @xmath447=[f^{\\tau}]$ ] .    in @xcite ,",

    "[ solvelog ] suppose @xmath59 and @xmath449 .",
    "then @xmath0 is cyclic in the dirichlet space .",
    "as discussed above , the logarithmic condition @xmath443 implies that @xmath0 is outer .",
    "next , by lemma [ interpolation ] , @xmath450 for all @xmath445 , and so @xmath447=[f^{\\tau}]$ ] for each @xmath451 . since the lemma also implies @xmath452 in @xmath25 as @xmath453 , we have @xmath447=[1]$ ] , and the assertion follows .    the following is the main result for the remaining cases @xmath454 and @xmath455 .",
    "[ cyclic1 ] let @xmath456 and @xmath457 .",
    "suppose there is a sequence of polynomials @xmath458 that approach @xmath459 in @xmath27 norm with @xmath460 for some constant @xmath461 .",
    "then @xmath0 is cyclic in @xmath27",
    ".    an immediate consequence of theorem [ cyclic1 ] is that if @xmath462 can be approximated in @xmath1 by polynomials @xmath458 with @xmath463 , then @xmath0 is cyclic .",
    "brown and cohn proved ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem b ) ) that for any closed set of logarithmic capacity zero @xmath464 , there exists a cyclic function @xmath0 in @xmath25 such that @xmath465 .",
    "the functions they build satisfy this hypothesis on @xmath418 , and therefore , these assumptions are always satisfied by at least one cyclic function , for any potential cyclic function zero set .",
    "we can assume @xmath466 , because otherwise the statement is immediate .",
    "as discussed earlier in this section , the function @xmath0 is in @xmath27 .",
    "now , for any sequence of polynomials @xmath467 by the triangle inequality @xmath468    the first summand on the right hand side can be bounded by @xmath469 moreover , for @xmath470 the multiplier norm of a function is controlled by the @xmath471 norm of its derivative .",
    "hence , a good choice of approximating polynomials is to select @xmath48 so that @xmath472 and @xmath473 , which is possible by weierstrass theorem . with this choice , the first summand on the right hand side in approaches @xmath140 as @xmath365 .",
    "note that these polynomials @xmath2 converge pointwise to @xmath474 and therefore , to prove the cyclicity of @xmath0 , it is sufficient to show that the norms of @xmath475 stay bounded .",
    "so what remains to show is that , as @xmath5 goes to infinity , @xmath476 is uniformly bounded . to evaluate this expression for large @xmath5",
    ", we use the norm in terms of the derivative : @xmath477 the last term tends to @xmath140 since @xmath418 approaches @xmath459 pointwise .    in the first summand on the right hand side , taking out a common factor , we see that @xmath478 for some constant @xmath240 . given our assumptions on @xmath418 , the right hand side is less than a constant .",
    "this concludes the proof .    it would be interesting to determine whether the required approximation property of the polynomials @xmath418 in theorem [ cyclic1 ] is a consequence of the other hypotheses",
    "in this paper we have primarily been interested in functions @xmath16 that are cyclic and have @xmath479 for at least one @xmath480 .",
    "prime examples of such a function are @xmath481 which we have examined closely in this paper for @xmath482 a natural number .",
    "numerical experiments , described below , suggest that a study of the zero sets @xmath86 of approximating polynomials may be interesting from the point of view of cyclicity .",
    "it seems that the rate at which zeros approach the circle is related to the extent to which the corresponding polynomials furnish approximants in @xmath1 . for instance , we have compared the zero sets associated with the taylor polynomials of @xmath483 with those of riesz - type polynomials , @xmath484      intuitively , since @xmath483 has a pole at @xmath485 , we should expect the approximating polynomials @xmath2 to be `` large '' in the intersection of disks of the form @xmath486 with the unit disk . on the other hand , the remainder functions @xmath487 have to tend to zero in norm ( and hence pointwise ) .",
    "we note that since @xmath483 has a pole on @xmath47 , the taylor series of @xmath483 can not have radius of convergence greater than @xmath88 .",
    "it therefore follows from jentzsch s theorem that every point on @xmath47 is a limit point of the zeros of the sequence @xmath488 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for background material concerning sections of polynomials , and for useful computer code .",
    "we start with the simplest case @xmath489 .",
    "the zeros of the taylor polynomials @xmath67 , the cesro polynomials @xmath490 , and the riesz polynomials @xmath491 , for @xmath492 , can be found in figure [ oneminuszeefig ] .",
    "all the zeros of these polynomials are located outside the unit disk , and inside a certain cardioid - like curve . in the case of the taylor polynomials ,",
    "the explicit formula @xmath493 holds , and so @xmath494 simply consists of the @xmath5-th roots of unity , minus the point @xmath206 .",
    "replacing taylor polynomials by cesro polynomials has the effect of repelling zeros away from the unit circle , and into the exterior of the disk .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced for the riesz polynomials , where it appears that convergence of roots to the unit circumference , and the roots of unity in particular , is somewhat slower .",
    "note also the relative absence of zeros close to the pole of @xmath495 , and the somewhat tangential approach region at @xmath206 .",
    "next , we turn to a function with two simple zeros on @xmath47 , namely @xmath496 plots of zeros of successive approximating polynomials are displayed in figure [ oneminuszeepluszee2fig ] . while @xmath497 is more complicated , the general features of figure [ oneminuszeefig ] persist",
    ". we again note a relative absence of zeros close to the two poles of @xmath65 , and the zeros of the cesro and riesz polynomials are again located in the exterior disk , and seem to tend to @xmath47 more slowly .",
    "we observe approach regions with vertices at the symmetrically placed poles , and the angle at these vertices seems to decrease as we move from taylor polynomials through cesro polynomials to the polynomials in",
    ".        it would be interesting to investigate whether there is a relationship between zeros of approximating polynomials , the region of convergence of the taylor series of @xmath474 and the cyclicity of @xmath0 in future work .",
