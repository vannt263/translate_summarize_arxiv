    "in a globally neutral plasma , the transversality of the magnetic fields implies , at high conductivity , the conservation of _ both _ magnetic flux and magnetic helicity .",
    "the plasma element evolves always glued together with magnetic flux lines whose number of associated knots and twists does not change .",
    "the _ energetical _ and the _ topological _ properties of the magnetic flux lines are _ conserved _ in the superconducting ( or ideal ) regime .",
    "moreover , the linearity of the magnetohydrodynamical equations in the mean electric and magnetic fields implies that there are no chances that large scale magnetic fields could be _ generated _ only using electromagnetic plasma effects .    as noticed long ago @xcite magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) represents a quite powerful method in order to analyze the dynamics of the interstellar plasma .",
    "in particular the topological properties of the magnetic field lines and of the bulk velocity field play a significant role in the dynamo theory ( often invoked in order to explain the typical amplitudes of large scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies @xcite ) and it seems well established that for successfully implementing the dynamo mechanism we are led to postulate a _ global _ parity violation at the scale at which the dynamo action is turned on @xcite .",
    "again , because of the linearity of mhd , in order to explain the galactic magnetic fields @xcite we have to assume that at some finite moment of time ( after the big - bang ) some magnetic seeds @xcite had to be present .    up to now ,",
    "the attention has been mainly focused on the energetical properties of the seeds and very little has been said concerning their topological features .",
    "apart from the dynamo mechanism , the topology of the magnetic flux lines seems less relevant ( for the seed problem ) than their associated energy density .",
    "however , going backward in time , we find that the topological properties of long range ( abelian ) gauge fields can have unexpected physical implications .",
    "the importance of the topological properties of long range ( abelian ) hypercharge magnetic fields has been indeed emphasized in the past @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the interesting possibility of macroscopic parity breaking at finite fermionic density and finite temperature was studied and it was suggested that if parity is globally broken an electromagnetic current density directed along the magnetic field can arise .",
    "a similar observation has been made in the context of the standard electroweak theory at finite temperature and chemical potential @xcite where it has been observed that , thanks to the anomalous coupling of the hypercharge the fermionic density can be converted into infra - red modes of the hypercharge field .    if the spectrum of hypermagnetic fields is dominated by parity non - invariant configurations the baryon asymmetry of the universe could be the result of the decay of these condensates @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to connect the topological properties of the hypermagnetic flux tubes to the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) by discussing a class of dynamical mechanisms leading to the generation of hk .",
    "the evolution of mean hypermagnetic fields in an electroweak plasma at finite conductivity and finite fermionic densities can be derived @xcite and it turns out that a good gauge - invariant measure of global parity invariance is the hypermagnetic helicity , i.e. @xmath0 . if the hypermagnetic field distribution is _ topologically trivial _",
    "( i.e. @xmath1 ) matter ",
    "antimatter fluctuations can be generated at the electroweak scale @xcite . provided the typical correlation scale of the magnetic helicity is larger than ( or of the order of ) the neutron diffusion scale blue - shifted at the electroweak epoch [ i.e. @xmath2 at @xmath3 , matter ",
    "antimatter domains can survive until the onset of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) leading to non standard initial conditions for the light element abundances calculations . in the presence of a fraction of antimatter at bbn a reduction of the neutron to proton ratio",
    "can be foreseen with consequent reduction of the @xmath4he abundance .",
    "this effect was recently pointed out in bbn calculations @xcite in the presence of spherical antimatter domains and further work is in progress @xcite .",
    "an example of _ topologically trivial _ distribution of hypermagnetic fields leading to some of the above mentioned effects is a stochastic bacground whose ( parity - invariant ) two - point function can be expressed , in fourier space , as @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is a dimension - less factor measuring the intensity of the stochastic hypermagnetic background ) .",
    "since hypermagnetic fields are strictly divergence free ( i.e. no hypermagnetic monopoles are present ) the magnetic flux lines form a mixture of closed loops evolving glued to their electroweak plasma element traveling with velocity @xmath7 . as far as we",
    "are concerned with scales larger than the hypermagnetic diffusivity scale ( i.e. @xmath8 at @xmath9 ) , then these flux loops can not break or twist .",
    "if the universe is filled , at some scale , by _ topologically non - trivial _ hk the flux lines form a network of _ stable knots and twists _ which can not be broken provided the conductivity is high .",
    "therefore @xmath10 .",
    "thus , completely homogeneous hypermagnetic configurations can not be topologically non - trivial .",
    "if we want to have knots and twists in the flux lines , we are necessarily driven towards field configurations which are not only time but also space dependent like the chern - simons waves @xcite analogous to the magnetic knot configurations @xcite frequently employed in the analysis of dynamo instabilities @xcite .",
    "if the hypermagnetic configurations are _ topologically non - trivial _ ( and consequently inhomogeneous ) some knots in the lines of the velocity field can be also expected .",
    "indeed , by solving the hypermagnetic diffusivity equation to leading order in the resistivity expansion , the velocity field turns out to be proportional to the hypermagnetic field , namely @xmath11 .",
    "notice that this is nothing but the electroweak analogous of the alfvn velocity @xcite so important in the spectrum of ( ordinary ) plasma waves @xcite .",
    "since the hypermagnetic fields are divergence - free , the fluid will also be incompressible ( i.e. @xmath12 ) as required , by equations of mhd .",
    "it is now clear that the topological properties of the magnetic flux lines can be connected with the topological properties of the velocity field lines .    in this paper",
    "we want to understand if it is at all possible to _ generate a topologically non - trivial distribution of hypercharge fluctuations from a topologically trivial collection of the same fields_. more physically we are going to investigate how to create knots and twists in a stochastic collection of disconnected magnetic flux loops .",
    "we would also like to understand if this kind of mechanism can or can not be implemented in some reasonably motivated cosmological framework .",
    "a way of twisting the topology of a collection of independent ( hypermagnetic ) flux loops , is to have dynamical pseudoscalar fields at finite fermionic density .",
    "the reason is twofold . on one hand dynamical pseudoscalars fields",
    "are coupled to gauge fields through the anomaly and , as a result , they induce a coupling between the two polarizations of photons and/or hyperphotons . on the other hand , unlike the ordinary electromagnetic fields , the coupling of the hypercharge field to fermions is chiral @xcite .",
    "the generation of hypermagnetic knots can influence the evolution of the chemical potential leading to the production of the bau @xcite .",
    "the bau can be produced _",
    "provided _ the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is strongly first order , _ provided _ the typical scale of the hk exceeds the diffusivity scale associated with the finite value of the hyperconductivity , and _ provided _ the rate of the slowest processes in the plasma is sufficiently high .",
    "unfortunately , in the minimal standard model ( msm ) the ewpt can not be strongly first order for higgs boson masses larger than the @xmath13 boson mass @xcite .",
    "it is true that the presence of a ( topologically trivial ) hypermagnetic background @xcite can modify the phase diagram but can not make the ewpt strongly first order .",
    "we will argue that our scenario can have some chances in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) where , incidentally , the rate of the right - electron chirality flip processes can also be larger than in the msm .",
    "dynamical pseudoscalars have been used in the past in order to generate seeds for the magnetohydrodynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "our concern here is different and it is mainly connected with the bau .",
    "suppose that at some moment in the life of the universe dynamical pseudoscalars fields are present .",
    "then , at finite conductivity and finite fermionic density ( i.e. finite chemical potential ) both , the chemical potential and the pseudoscalar particles , can be coupled to the anomaly .",
    "in flat space , the interactions between a pseudoscalar field and an abelian gauge field can be parameterized as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pseudoscalar coupling constant , @xmath16 the typical energy scale and @xmath17}$ ] is the gauge field strength expressed in terms of the vector potentials . in our analysis",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the case of the hypercharge field and with the case of the ordinary electromagnetic field .",
    "imagine now that the pseudoscalar field is uniform but time dependent .",
    "if our initial state is a ( topologically trivial ) stochastic distribution of gauge field fluctuations the effect of the interaction described in eq .",
    "( [ psint ] ) will be to couple the two ( transverse ) polarizations of the gauge fields . since the evolution equations of the two ( independent ) polarizations are different , there are no reasons to expect that the topological structure of the initial gauge field distribution will be left unchanged by the presence of pseudoscalar interactions",
    ". the inclusion of a ( macroscopic ) ohmic conductivity will automatically select a preferred reference frame ( the so called `` plasma frame '' ) where the flux and helicity associated with the magnetic component of the the abelian background are both ( approximately ) conserved if the resistivity is small .    in the plasma frame",
    ", the initial stochastic distribution of gauge field fluctuations can be viewed as a collection of unknotted magnetic flux tubes ( closed by transversality ) which evolve independently without breaking or intersecting each others .",
    "the inclusion of pseudoscalar interactions will then alter the topological properties of the magnetic flux lines by introducing links between independent loops and by also twisting a single loop .",
    "part of the results reported in this paper have been recently presented ( in a more compact form ) in @xcite .",
    "the plan of our paper is then the following . in section",
    "ii we introduce the basic description of hypermagnetic fields coupled to dynamical pseudoscalars in an empty ( but expanding ) space .",
    "we will then solve the time evolution of the field operators in the heisenberg representation . in section iii we will formally address the problem of emission of hypermagnetic knots induced by dynamical pseudoscalars . in section iv we will concentrate our attention on the hypermagnetic helicity production during an inflationary phase whereas in section v we will discuss the radiation dominated phase . in section vi we will connect the production of ( mean ) hypermagnetic helicity to the bau and in section vii we will investigate the regions of parameter space where the generate bau can be phenomenologically relevant .",
    "in section viii we will examine , for sake of completeness , the problem of global parity breaking induced by axionic particles .",
    "section ix contains our concluding remarks . in the appendix we collected some useful technical results",
    "the abelian nature of the hypercharge field does not imply that the hypermagnetic flux lines should have a trivial topological structure . we will name _ topologically trivial _ the configurations whose field lines are _ closed _",

    "in fact we know that even in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xcite the typical cross - over behavior @xcite of the phase transition does not change . ) the phase transition is stronger but it turns into a cross - over for sufficiently large higgs masses",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if for sufficiently strong hypermagnetic backgrounds the ambjorn - olesen phase can be generated @xcite ]    however , even if the phase transition would be strongly first order our mechanism would be ineffective .",
    "indeed , let us compute the bau in the case where @xmath229 .",
    "we have that the bau can be expressed as @xcite @xmath230 the expectation value appearing in the previous equation involves a highly non local operator which can be evaluated for scales larger than the diffusivity scale with the result that @xcite @xmath231 thus , we get that the bau can be expressed as @xmath232 where @xmath233 tev is the right - electron equilibration temperature @xcite . for typical values of the parameters ( the same we used in the case @xmath234 the bau is of the order of @xmath235 .",
    "we would be tempted to say that for large @xmath236 the bau could be recovered .",
    "unfortunately this assumption would contradict our initial hypotheses since it would mean that we go beyond the msm and that , consequently , we would have @xmath228 .",
    "notice that , as previously discussed @xcite , the results of our analysis are not in agreement with the statement that the bau can be generated from dynamical pseudoscalars in the msm , for hypermagnetic modes of the order of @xmath237 @xcite and independently of the specific value of the perturbative rate of right electron chirality flip processes .",
    "we want to observe , finally , that some mechanisms ( like the breaking of conformal invariance ) operating at some higher energy scale @xcite can generate a _ topologically trivial _",
    "hypermagnetic background whose energy density is small in critical units but anyway quite large if compared to the energy density of the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "since we are at high conductivity , the dissipation of the seeds is protected from being washed out by the hypermagnetic flux conservation .",
    "then , at some temperature ( in the tev range ) pseudoscalar oscillations will begin . at finite conductivity the pseudoscalar oscillations",
    "do not crucially amplify the initial hypermagnetic background but they twist its topology leading to a non vanishing chern - simons number density and , ultimately , to the bau .",
    "the same mechanism studied in the case of hk can be indeed exploited in order to produce ordinary _ magnetic _ knots for temperatures smaller than @xmath238 gev .",
    "the natural candidate would then be , in this case , the ordinary qcd axion .",
    "we will start by recalling the possible implications of global parity breaking in ordinary mhd and we will then show that the amount of global parity breaking induced by axion oscillations is indeed quite minute .      if , at some scale the _ ordinary _ magnetic field as opposed to the hypermagnetic field . ]",
    "@xmath239 , than we also have that the alfvn ( stationary ) flow will be tangled in the same way the related magnetic field is tangled since @xmath240 .",
    "this last condition together with the incompressible closure @xmath241 implies that also the velocity field is formed by a collection of closed loops whose degree of knottedness can be estimated from @xmath242 .",
    "notice that in the limit of negligible thermal and magnetic dffusivity both the magnetic and the velocity field can be treated with topological techniques @xcite .",
    "when the thermal and magnetic diffusivity are adiabatically switched on ( or , more physically , when we approach the magnetic and thermal diffusivity scales ) various dissipative phenomena arise and turbulence sets in .",
    "we do not want even to attempt to address the very rich structure arising in mhd turbulence .",
    "however , we simply want to notice that there are crucial differences if the turbulence arises starting from a parity invariant or from a parity non invariant configuration of the bulk velocity field @xcite .",
    "it has been actually observed long ago that @xcite , apparently , cosmic turbulence occurs usually in rotating bodies with density gradients .",
    "this results in a violation of the mirror symmetry of the plasma since it is possible , by taking the scalar product of the vorticity with the density gradient , to construct a pseudoscalar .",
    "the relevance of ( global ) parity breaking in mhd can be also appreciated by looking at the turbulent dynamo mechanism @xcite .",
    "the idea is that in astrophysical and cosmological plasmas the correlation scale of the velocity field is normally shorter than the correlation scale of the magnetic field . under this assumption from eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) it possible to obtain a dynamo equation by carefully averaging over the velocity field over scales and times exceeding the characteristic correlation scale and time @xmath243 of the velocity field . in this approximation",
    "the magnetic diffusivity equation can be written as @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the so - called dynamo term . in eq .",
    "( [ dynamo ] ) @xmath246 is the magnetic field averaged over times larger than @xmath243 , which is the typical correlation time of the velocity field ) .",
    "we can clearly see that the crucial requirement for the all averaging procedure we described is that the turbulent velocity field has to be `` globally '' non - mirror - symmetric .",
    "if the velocity field _ is _ parity invariant ( i.e. no vorticity for scales comparable with the correlation length of the magnetic field ) , then the dynamics of the infrared modes is decoupled from the velocity field since , over those scales , @xmath247 .",
    "therefore , for our purposes the @xmath245 term will be a good measure of the degree of knottedness associated with the velocity field .",
    "needless to say that that there is a puzzle associated with the turbulent dynamo mechanism @xcite . on one hand we _ see _ that our galaxy has an @xmath245 term which can be roughly estimated to be @xmath248 cm / sec in the interval @xmath249 ( it is assumed that @xmath250 ) @xcite . on the other hand we have to postulate that _ some _ alpha term had to be present also at the time of the protogalactic collapse ( occurred around @xmath251 sec ) .",
    "this is because we want the dynamo term to amplify , by differential rotation the primordial magnetic seeds up to the observed value of themagnetic field observed in spiral galaxies .",
    "thus , the parity breaking of the galactic turbulence seems to be more a consequence of some primordial ( global ) parity breaking than a theory of the galactic dynamo action .    if one wants to postulate some global parity breaking in the plasma the obvious question which arises",
    "is when this phenomenon could occur in the early universe .",
    "it should certainly be useful for the dynamo action to have some sort of global parity breaking at the decoupling epoch ( @xmath252 ) which is not so far ( for cosmological standards ) from the time of the protogalactic collapse . in principle , the parity breaking could occur even before but the only problem could be , in this case , that many of the known phenomena occurring in the early universe are normally discussed in terms of a mirror - symmetric plasma .",
    "for example the present bbn calculations do not include , to the best of our knowledge , possible effects of global parity violation @xcite and we would guess that to have global parity breaking might be a problem for nucleosynthesis .    the axion oscillations starting at a temperature of the order of @xmath37 gev can certainly produce a source of global parity breaking .",
    "the question is how large is the induced @xmath245 term in the primordial plasma .",
    "our aim is now to estimate the order of magnitude of the parity breaking induced through primordial electromagnetic helicity .",
    "as it is well known in axion models @xcite an extra ( global ) @xmath253 symmetry complements the msm .",
    "this symmetry is broken at the peccei - quinn scale @xmath254 and leads to a dynamical pseudo goldstone boson ( the axion ) which acquires a small mass because of soft instanton effects at the qcd phase transition .",
    "if an axionic density is present in the early universe , bounds can be obtained for the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale .",
    "these bounds together with astrophysical bounds ( coming mostly from red - giants cooling and from sn 1987a ) leave a window opportunity @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "there are different realizations of axion models . in some models @xcite quarks and leptons",
    "do not carry the peccei - quinn charge , whereas in other realizations the usual standard model leptons are not singlet under the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .",
    "we will not enter into the details of these two models since what matters for our consideration is , at least in the very first approximation , how the axion couples to the anomaly .",
    "there are also different cosmological realizations of axionic models .",
    "if an inflationary epoch takes place prior to the usual radiation dominated regime , the peccei - quinn phase can be aligned by today @xcite . in the absence of an inflationary phase it is likely",
    "that as the universe passes through the peccei - quinn phase transition a network of cosmic strings will be generated via the kibble mechanism @xcite .",
    "we will assume that an inflationary phase took place well before ( @xmath256 ) the onset of the ewpt .",
    "if the temperature of the universe exceeds the critical temperature of the ewpt the effective action describing the interaction of axions with the standard model gauge fields can be written as @xmath257 \\label{axionaction1}\\ ] ] where @xmath258 , @xmath259 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 coupling constants ( @xmath263 and @xmath36 are numerical constants of order 1 which depend upon the specific axion model ) .",
    "for @xmath139 the effective action becomes @xmath264 \\label{axionaction2}\\ ] ] where @xmath265 is the ordinary ( electromagnetic ) gauge field strength .",
    "there are important differences between the axion evolution for temperatures larger and smaller than the ewpt temperature .",
    "in fact @xcite , for @xmath138 the axion evolution equation is not only modified by the hubble damping factor , but also by damping induced by the qcd sphalerons which are not suppressed at high temperatures .",
    "this effect leads to an equation for @xmath42 which differs from the one introduced in the previous section and which can be written as @xmath266 where we dropped for simplicity the potential term .",
    "it turns out that @xcite @xmath267 ( where @xmath268 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath269 we have to conclude that the sphaleron induced damping dominates over the damping produced by the expansion of the universe ( i.e. @xmath270 ) . the axion time evolution will then be ( approximately ) suppressed as @xmath271 in a radiation dominated universe ( recall that @xmath272 ) .",
    "therefore , we have to accept that in eq .",
    "( [ decoupled ] ) the polarization mixing will be exponentially suppressed as time goes by .",
    "the sphaleron induced damping does not exclude other possible consequences associated with the axions at the ewpt like the possible existence of strong cp violating effects @xcite    notice that this argument does to not apply to temperatures @xmath273 when the plasma has already cooled sufficiently for @xmath274 to have turned off .",
    "therefore , for our purposes it seems certainly theoretically more plausible to consider the possible occurrence of coherent axion oscillations at temperatures of the oder of @xmath275 when the electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "in can be , in principle , dangerous to have production of parity non invariant configurations of the ordinary magnetic field right before the onset of bbn .",
    "suppose that the axion oscillations start at @xmath276 gev with a typical mass of @xmath277 gev .",
    "therefore we have to consider the ordinary axion oscillations coupled to the evolution of the ordinary vector potential at finite conductivity @xmath278 a_{\\pm } = 0 .",
    "\\label{axeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at high temperatures @xmath279 the axion is massless , but , at lower temperatures it develops a mass due to qcd instanton effects .",
    "the effects of instantons is highly suppressed at high temperatures , however , the temperature dependence of the axion mass is approximately given by @xcite @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the axion mass at zero temperature .",
    "axion oscillations between a temperature of the order of @xmath37 gev and @xmath282 mev ( i. e. around the nucleosynthesis epoch ) can generate electromagnetic helicity .",
    "suppose , for sake of simplicity that the axion oscillations will start with a typical mass f the order of @xmath277 gev .",
    "then , according to eq .",
    "( [ axeq ] ) , we have that the maximal amplified frequency and the diffusivity frequencies are of the order of @xmath283 where @xmath284 is of the order of @xmath37 gev",
    ". we can solve eq .",
    "( [ axeq ] ) similarly to what we did in hypermagnetic case . in the case",
    "@xmath285 the magnetic helicity produced via axion oscillations will be of the order of @xmath286 ( notice that @xmath287 and @xmath288 gev ) .",
    "( [ al ] ) provides then a rather small parity breaking and certainly irrelevant for the dynamo mechanism .",
    "in this paper we investigated the production of hypermagnetic knots .",
    "we found that hk can be efficiently produced provided some topologically trivial configuration of the hypermagnetic field is already present for scales larger than the hypermagnetic diffusivity scale .",
    "the bau can be successfully reproduced , but not in the msm .",
    "the reason is twofold . on one hand",
    "the phase transition is too weak ( even taking into account the possible presence of the hypermagnetic background ) . on the other hand",
    "the ( perturbative ) rate of the slowest processes in the plasma is too small . in the mssm",
    "the bau generation seems more probable and our mechanism can be viable , provided the typical scale of the hk exceeds the hypermagnetic diffusivity scale prior to the onset of the ewpt .",
    "inspired by the axial higgs we gave examples of specific scenarios where this mechanism can be implemented .",
    "we also discussed the possible production of magnetic helicity by ordinary qcd axions : we found that its value is too small to be phenomenologically relevant .",
