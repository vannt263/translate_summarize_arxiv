    "in recent years , interest in time - changes of stochastic processes according to irregular measures has arisen from various sources .",
    "fundamental examples of such time - changed processes include the so - called _ fontes - isopi - newman ( fin ) diffusion _",
    "@xcite , the introduction of which was motivated by the study of the localisation and aging properties of physical spin systems , and the two - dimensional _ liouville brownian motion _",
    "@xcite , which is the diffusion naturally associated with planar liouville quantum gravity . more precisely , the fin diffusion is the time - change of one - dimensional brownian motion by the positive continuous additive functional with revuz measure given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the poisson point process with intensity @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the probability measure placing all its mass at @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the two - dimensional liouville brownian motion is the time - change of two - dimensional brownian motion by the positive continuous additive functional with revuz measure given by @xmath5 for some @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the massive gaussian free field ; actually the latter description is only formal since the gaussian free field can not be defined as a function in two dimensions . in both cases , connections have been made with discrete models ; the fin diffusion is known to be the scaling limit of the one - dimensional bouchaud trap model @xcite and the constant speed random walk amongst heavy - tailed random conductances in one - dimension @xcite , and the two - dimensional liouville brownian motion is conjectured to be the scaling limit of simple random walks on random planar maps @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the goal here is to provide a general framework for studying such processes and their discrete approximations in the case when the underlying stochastic process is strongly recurrent , in the sense that it can be described by a resistance form , as introduced by kigami ( see @xcite for background ) . in particular , this includes the case of brownian motion on tree - like spaces and low - dimensional self - similar fractals .    to present our main results ,",
    "let us start by introducing the types of object under consideration ( for further details , see section [ prelimsec ] ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be the collection of quadruples of the form @xmath9 , where : @xmath10 is a non - empty set ; @xmath11 is a resistance metric on @xmath10 such that @xmath12 is complete , separable and locally compact , and moreover closed balls in @xmath12 are compact ; @xmath13 is a locally finite borel regular measure of full support on @xmath12 ; and @xmath14 is a marked point in @xmath10 .",
    "note that the resistance metric is associated with a resistance form @xmath15 ( see definition [ resformdef ] below ) , and we will further assume that for elements of @xmath8 this form is regular in the sense of definition [ regulardef ] .",
    "in particular , this ensures the existence of a related regular dirichlet form @xmath16 on @xmath17 , which we suppose is recurrent , and also a hunt process @xmath18 that can be checked to admit jointly measurable local times @xmath19 .",
    "the process @xmath20 represents our underlying stochastic process ( i.e.  it plays the role that brownian motion does in the construction of the fin diffusion and liouville brownian motion ) , and the existence of local times means that when it comes to defining the time - change additive functional , it will be possible to do this explicitly .    towards establishing a scaling limit for discrete processes , we will assume that we have a sequence @xmath21 in @xmath8 that converges with respect to the gromov - hausdorff - vague topology ( see section [ ghpsec ] ) to an element @xmath22 .",
    "our initial aim is to show that it is then the case that the associated hunt processes @xmath23 and their local times @xmath24 converge to @xmath20 and @xmath25 , respectively . to do this we assume some regularity for the measures in the sequence  this requirement is formalised in assumption [ a1 ] , which depends on the following volume growth property . in the statement of the latter ,",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the open ball in @xmath27 centred at @xmath28 and of radius @xmath29 , and also @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we note that this control on the volume yields an equicontinuity property for the local times .",

    "the time - change additive functional that we consider is the following : @xmath55 in particular , let @xmath56 be the right - continuous inverse of @xmath57 , and define a process @xmath58 by setting @xmath59 as described in section [ rfsec ] , this is the trace of @xmath20 on the support of @xmath53 ( with respect to the measure @xmath53 ) , and its dirichlet form is given by the corresponding dirichlet form trace .",

    "[ maincor ] ( a ) suppose assumption [ a2 ] holds , and that @xmath53 has full support",

    "+ ( b ) suppose assumption [ a2 ] holds , and that @xmath20 is continuous",

    "the above results are proved in section  [ copsec ] , following the introduction of preliminary material in section  [ prelimsec ] . in the remainder of the article",
    ", we demonstrate the application of theorem  [ main1 ] and corollary  [ maincor ] to a number of natural examples .",
    "firstly , we investigate the liouville brownian motion associated with a resistance form , showing in proposition  [ lbmconv ] that assumption  [ a1 ] implies the convergence of the corresponding liouville brownian motions .",
    "this allows us to deduce the convergence of liouville brownian motions on a variety of trees and fractals , which we discuss in example  [ lbmexamples ] .",
    "we note that liouville brownian motion associated with a resistance form is a toy model and we discuss it merely as a simple example of our methods .",
    "the more interesting and challenging problem of analysing this process in two dimensions is not possible within our framework .",
    "next , in section  [ bouchsec ] , we proceed similarly for the bouchaud trap model , describing the limiting process as the fin process associated with a resistance form in proposition  [ btmresult ] , and giving an application in example  [ sg55ex ] .",
    "related to this , in section  [ rcmsec ] , we study the heavy - tailed random conductance model on trees and a class of self - similar fractals , discussing a fin limit for the so - called constant speed random walk in propositions  [ rcmtreeresult ] ,  [ ssfrcmresult ] and examples  [ exa6 - 5 ] ,  [ exa6 - 18 ] .",
    "heat kernel estimates for the limiting fin processes will be presented in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .    of the applications outlined in the previous paragraph , one that is particularly illustrative of the contribution of",
    "this article is the random conductance model on the ( pre-)sierpiski gasket graphs .",
    "more precisely , the random conductance model on a locally finite , connected graph @xmath71 is obtained by first randomly selecting edge - indexed conductances @xmath72 , and then , conditional on these , defining a continuous time markov chain that jumps along edges with probabilities proportional to the conductances .",
    "for the latter process , there are two time scales commonly considered in the literature : firstly , for the _ variable speed random walk ( vsrw ) _ , the jump rate along edge @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 , so that the holding time at a vertex @xmath28 has mean @xmath75 ; secondly , for the _ constant speed random walk ( csrw ) _ , holding times are assumed to have unit mean . from this description , it is clear that the csrw is a time - change of the vsrw according to the measure placing mass @xmath76 on vertex @xmath28 . here",
    ", we will only ever consider conductances that are uniformly bounded below , but this still gives a rich enough model for there to exist a difference in the trapping behaviour experienced by the vsrw and csrw . indeed , in the one - dimensional case ( i.e.  when @xmath77 is @xmath78 equipped with edges between nearest neighbours ) when conductances are i.i.d .",
    ", it is easily checked that the vsrw has as its scaling limit brownian motion ( by adapting the argument of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) to the vsrw , for example ) ; although the vsrw will cross edges of large conductance many times before escaping , it does so quickly , so that homogenisation still occurs . in the case of random conductances also uniformly bounded from above , the analogous result was proved in @xcite for the vsrw on the fractal graphs shown in figure [ sg ] , with limit being brownian motion on the sierpiski gasket . in section [ rcmfractalsec ] ,",
    "we extend this result significantly to show the same is true whenever the conductance distribution has at most polynomial decay at infinity .",
    "specifically , writing @xmath79 for the vsrw on the @xmath80th level graph and @xmath20 for brownian motion on the sierpiski gasket , we prove that , under the annealed law ( averaging over both process and environment ) , @xmath81 the time scaling here is the same as for the vsrw on the unweighted graph . for the csrw , on the other hand , the many crossings of edges of large conductance lead to more significant trapping , which remains in the limit . in particular ,",
    "if the conductance distribution satisfies @xmath82 for some @xmath83 , then , as noted above , in the one - dimensional case the csrw has a fin diffusion limit @xcite . applying our time - change results , we are able to show that the corresponding result holds for the sierpiski gasket graphs .",
    "namely , writing @xmath84 for the csrw on the @xmath80th level graph , we establish that there exists a constant @xmath85 such that , again under the annealed law , @xmath86 where the limit is now @xmath87-fin diffusion on the sierpiski gasket , which is time - change of the brownian motion on the limiting gasket by a poisson random measure defined similarly to ( [ onedfinmeasure ] ) , but with lebesgue measure in the intensity replaced by the appropriate hausdorff measure .",
    "( note that , in the case that @xmath88 , our techniques also yield convergence of csrw to the brownian motion , see remark [ finitemoments ] . )",
    "full details for the preceding discussion are provided in section [ rcmsec ] . at the start of the latter section",
    ", we also give an expanded heuristic explanation for the appearance of the fin diffusion as a limit of the csrw amongst heavy - tailed conductances .",
    "we remark that the specific conclusion of this interpretation is dependent on the point recurrence of the processes involved ; by contrast , for the random conductance model on @xmath89 for @xmath90 , the same trapping behaviour gives rise in the limit to the so - called _ fractional kinetics process _",
    ", for which the time - change and spatial motion are uncorrelated @xcite .    finally , we note",
    "there are many other applications to which the notion of time - change is relevant , so that the techniques of this article might be useful .",
    "although we do not consider it here , one such example is the _ diffusion on branching brownian motion _ , as recently constructed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , whilst the examples of time - changes described above are based on measures that are constant in time , our main results will also be convenient for describing time - changes based on space - time measures , i.e.  via additive functionals of the form @xmath91 .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ main1 ] would be well - suited to extending the study of the scaling limits of randomly trapped random walks , as introduced in @xcite , from the one - dimensional setting to trees and fractals .",
    "in this section , we define precisely the objects of study and outline some of their relevant properties ; primarily this involves a recap of results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we start by recalling the definition of a resistance form and its associated resistance metric .",

    "we note that can be rewritten as @xmath110 which is the effective resistance between @xmath28 and @xmath111 .",
    "the function @xmath112 is actually a metric on @xmath10 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) ) ; we call this the _ resistance metric _ associated with @xmath15",
    ". henceforth , we will assume that we have a non - empty set @xmath10 equipped with a resistance form @xmath15 such that @xmath12 is complete , separable and locally compact . defining the open ball centred at @xmath28 and of radius @xmath29 with respect to the resistance metric by @xmath113 , and denoting its closure by @xmath114 , we will also assume that @xmath114 is compact for any @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict our attention to resistance forms that are regular , as per the following definition .",
    "[ regulardef ] let @xmath117 be the collection of compactly supported , continuous ( with respect to @xmath11 ) functions on @xmath10 , and @xmath118 be the supremum norm for functions on @xmath10 .",

    "see @xcite for the definition of a regular dirichlet form .",
    "the quadratic form @xmath16 is a regular dirichlet form on @xmath17 .",
    "given a regular dirichlet form , standard theory then gives us the existence of an associated hunt process @xmath18 ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.2.1 ) ) .",
    "note that such a process is , in general , only specified uniquely for starting points outside a set of zero capacity .",
    "however , in this setting every point has strictly positive capacity ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.9 ) ) , and so the process is defined uniquely everywhere . moreover , since we are assuming closed balls are compact , we have from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 10.4 ) that @xmath20 admits a jointly continuous transition density @xmath125 .",
    "we note that the dirichlet form for brownian motion on @xmath126 is a resistance form only when @xmath127 . however , resistance forms are a rich class that contains various dirichlet forms for diffusions on fractals , see @xcite .",
    "key to this study will be the existence of local times for @xmath20 .",
    "as a first step to introducing these , note that the strict positivity of the capacity of points remarked upon above implies that all points are regular ( see ( * ? ?",
    "* theorems 1.3.14 and 3.1.10 , and lemma a.2.18 ) , for example ) .",
    "thus @xmath20 admits local times everywhere ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( v.3.13 ) ) ) . in the following lemma , by studying the potential density of @xmath20 , we check that these local times can be defined in a jointly measurable way and satisfy an occupation density formula .",

    "to prove part ( a ) , we essentially follow the proof of ( * ? ? ?",

    "first , observe that the definition of the resistance metric at ( [ resdef ] ) readily implies @xmath138 for all @xmath109 , @xmath104 .",
    "hence @xmath139 using the local compactness of @xmath12 , for any point @xmath115 , we can integrate the above over a compact neighbourhood of @xmath28 to obtain @xmath140 for any @xmath141 , where @xmath122 was defined at .",

    "* theorem 7.20 ) , one can check @xmath149 for every @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "it follows that @xmath152 agrees with the resolvent of @xmath20 on @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath153 for all @xmath150 , and extending the latter statement to all @xmath154 is elementary . by the continuity of the transition density in this",
