    "percolation  @xcite is a leading geometric model for connectivity in irregular media . in abstract terms",
    ", percolation is the passage of an effect through a medium which is irregularly structured in the sense that the effect can propagate through some regions whereas it can not pass other areas .",
    "such a medium could be a network of resistors connecting nearest neighboring sites of a @xmath1-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice and the effect would be a current @xmath2 injected at site @xmath3 and extracted at site @xmath4 .",
    "irregularity in the medium could be realized by randomly removing resistors with a probability @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the occupation probability @xmath6 the resistors ( bonds ) are likely to either be isolated or to form clusters .",
    "two sites belong to the same cluster if they are connected by a path of bonds and hence current can flow between them . at low @xmath6 two infinitely separated terminal sites @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 are not connected by such a path and the network behaves as an insulator . for large @xmath6 , on the other hand , many paths between @xmath3 and @xmath4 may exist and the network is a conductor .",
    "therefore , at some probability in between , a threshold @xmath7 must exist where for the first time current can percolate from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "below @xmath7 we have an insulator .",
    "above @xmath7 we have a conductor .",
    "the threshold probability is called the percolation threshold , or , since it separates two different phases , the critical probability .    in this picture",
    "the effect can percolate through occupied bonds in all directions .",
    "the resulting clusters are typically isotropic in space .",
    "therefore ordinary percolation is referred to as isotropic percolation ( ip ) .",
    "the linear extend of the isotropic clusters can be characterized by the correlation length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the correlation length exponent of the ip universality class .",
    "directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite is an anisotropic variant of percolation .",
    "the bonds function as diodes so that the current can percolate only along a given preferred direction .",
    "typical dp clusters are anisotropic and they are characterized by two different correlation lengths : @xmath10 ( parallel to the preferred direction ) and @xmath11 ( perpendicular to it ) .",
    "as one approaches the critical probability , the two correlation lengths diverge with the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the dp universality class .",
    "dp is perhaps the simplest model resulting in branching self - affine objects .",
    "it has many potential applications , including fluid flow through porous media under gravity , hopping conductivity in a strong electric field  @xcite , crack propagation  @xcite , and the propagation of surfaces at depinning transitions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is related to epidemics with recovery  @xcite and self - organized critical models  @xcite .",
    "if the preferred direction is interpreted as time , a dp cluster represents the history of a stochastic process . in this interpretation",
    "the dp universality class is the generic universality class for phase transitions between an active and an inactive absorbing state .",
    "the transport properties of ip have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "for example , the average two - port resistance @xmath14 of a random resistor network ( rrn ) , i.e. , a percolation model in which the bonds are assigned a finite nonzero conductance , is known to obey in the vicinity of the percolation threshold the power law  @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 being referred to as the resistance exponent for ip .    compared to ip",
    "relatively little is known about transport in dp . in this paper",
    "we study the average resistance in dp by employing the powerful methods of renormalized field theory .",
    "we find that this quantity is governed in the vicinity of the critical probability by a resistance exponent @xmath0 analogous to @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , measured in the preferred , time - like direction between two terminal sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 it scales like @xmath19 we obtain that @xmath0 is given to second order in the departure @xmath20 from 5 dimensions by @xmath21 \\epsilon \\right\\ }   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our field theoretic approach thrives on our real world interpretation of feynman diagrams which has proven to be successful in studying transport in ip via rrn  @xcite .",
    "a real - world interpretation in the same spirit applies to dp also .",
    "we show that the feynman diagrams utilized in this paper can be interpreted as being directed resistor networks .",
    "on one hand this remedies the complexity of the field theory and makes it more intuitive . on the other hand",
    "it simplifies the actual calculations . as shown below , the basic task in calculating the average resistance in dp",
    "is to calculate the resistance of feynman diagrams .",
    "the remaining steps",
    "are completely analogous to those well known from previous field theoretic approaches  @xcite to usual , i.e. , purely geometric dp .    brief account of our results was given in  @xcite .",

    "our approach is based on a model which captures both , ip and dp , namely the random resistor diode network ( rdn ) introduced by redner  .",
    "a rdn consists of a @xmath1-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice in which nearest - neighbor sites are connected by a resistor , a positive diode ( conducting only in a preferred direction ) , a negative diode ( conducting only opposite to the preferred direction ) , or an insulator with respective probabilities @xmath6 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in the three dimensional phase diagram ( pictured as a tetrahedron spanned by the four probabilities ) one finds a non - percolating and three percolating phases .",
