    "one important instance is that of minkowski spacetime , where these green s functions are known explicitly . here , we will carry out the analysis in detail for the 4 dimensional case , and obtain @xmath7$]-accurate solutions to the green s functions in perturbed minkowski spacetime up to quadrature .",

    "green s functions play crucial roles in understanding the dynamics of both classical and quantum field theories .",

    "we emphasize that the causal structure of the green s function , as exhibited by equations , and means , in a generic curved spacetime , the observer receives fields not only from her past light cone ( edge of the dark oval ) , but also its interior ( dark oval itself ) .",
    "in addition , there is some ( scalar , photon or graviton)-producing source @xmath23 which sweeps out a world tube , and our observer receives radiation from the portion of this world tube that lies on and within the interior of her past light cone .",
    "the picture here is to be contrasted against the minkowski one , where observers only detect fields from their past null cone.,width=336 ]    from equations , and , we see that the physical solution of a linear field theory can be expressed as the sum of two integrals of the green s function ( and its gradient ) , one weighted by the sources present in the system at hand and the other weighted by the initial conditions of the fields themselves .",
    "in particular , the @xmath34-dimensional volume integrals ( with respect to @xmath12 ) of the green s functions , weighted by the field - producing @xmath23s , reaffirms the interpretation that the green s function is the field of a spacetime - point ",

    "signals travel strictly on the null cone , and the radiation received at some location @xmath17 is related to the source at retarded time @xmath40 . in the former , signals travel at all speeds equal and less than unity . and @xmath41 are equivalent in its eyes",
    ". we will shortly elaborate on this point . ]",
    "( we are setting @xmath42 . ) this off - the - light - cone piece of massless radiation is known in the literature as the tail ( or , sometimes , wake ) ; and is often touted as a violation of huygens principle in curved spacetime . as elucidated by dewitt and brehme @xcite , this implies the electrodynamics of even a single electrically charged particle depends on its entire past history : it exerts a force upon itself ( a  self - force \" ) , in addition to the one already present in flat minkowski spacetime , because the electromagnetic fields it produces travels away from it but then scatters off the geometry of spacetime and returns to interact with it at some later time .",
    "* gravitational dynamics * this tail - induced self - force finds an analog in the gravitational dynamics of compact objects orbiting massive black holes , because the gravitational waves they generate scatter off the non - trivial background geometry and return to nudge their trajectories away from a geodesic one .",
    "the gravitational radiation signals of such systems are believed to be within reach of future gravitational wave detectors , and there is currently intense theoretical work done to understand their dynamics .",
    "perturbation theory in the weak field limit of schwarzschild and kerr may thus provide us with approximate but concrete results from which we can gain physical insight from ( and possibly serve as a check against numerical calculations ) .",
    "for instance , that the tail effect is the result of massless fields scattering off the background geometry will be manifest within the perturbative framework we are about to undertake ; this point has already been noted by dewitt and dewitt @xcite and pfenning and poisson @xcite .",
    "* cosmology * turning our attention now to cosmology , the past decades have provided us with observational evidence that we live in a universe that is , at the roughest level , described by the spatially flat flrw metric . in conformal coordinates , it is @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 tells us the relative size of the universe at various times along its evolution .",
    "most of our inference of the properties of the universe come from examining light emanating from objects at cosmological or astrophysical distances , and furthermore our interpretation of electromagnetic signals are based on the assumption that they travel on null geodesics .",
    "this statement is precisely true when the metric is because the maxwell action that governs the dynamics of photons in vacuum , is insensitive to the conformal factor @xmath45 .",
    "specifically , in 4 dimensional spacetime , @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] are exactly the same object ; the conformal factor @xmath45 drops out .",

    "in particular , it travels only along null geodesics .",
    "however , cosmological and astrophysical observations have become so sensitive that it is no longer sufficient to model our universe as the exactly smooth and homogeneous spacetime in .",
    "rather , one needs to account for the metric perturbations , @xmath49 because the @xmath45 drops out of the maxwell action , we recognize that a first principles theoretical investigation of the propagation of light over cosmological distances is equivalent to the same investigation in perturbed minkowski spacetime .",
    "moreover , since the geometry is now curved ( albeit weakly so ) , light traveling over cosmological length scales should therefore develop tails . as already mentioned in the abstract , if a significant portion of light emitted from a supernova at cosmological distances leaks off the light cone , then the observer on earth may mistakenly infer that it is dimmer than it actually is , as some of the light has not yet arrived .",
    "this leakage may also modify the light curves of these objects at cosmological distances .",
    "to our knowledge , the size of the electromagnetic tail effect in cosmology has not been examined before .",
    "our development of perturbation theory for the photon green s function ( and confirmation of dewitt and dewitt s first order results @xcite ) in perturbed minkowski , is therefore the first step to a thorough , first principles based , understanding of the properties of light in the cosmological context .",
    "this may in turn affect how we interpret cosmological and astronomical observations .    * jwkb *",
    "now , the jwkb approximation where one assumes that the wavelength of the massless fields are extremely small relative to the characteristic length scales of the spacetime geometry ( which , in term , usually amounts to neglecting all geometric terms relative to the @xmath50 in the wave equation ) , is often used to justify that null cone propagation is the dominant channel of travel for massless fields in generic curved spacetimes .",
    "( see for example misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite . ) here , we caution that , even in cases where the jwkb approximation yields exact results , it does not imply that light travels solely on the light cone .",
    "such a counterexample is that of odd dimensional minkowski spacetimes , where the momentum vector @xmath51 satisfies the exact dispersion relation @xmath52 , but the green s functions of massless fields develop power law tails : for odd @xmath34 , @xmath53 \\propto ( ( t - t')^2-(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}')^2)^{-(d-2)/2}$ ] .",
    "( see soodak and tiersten @xcite for a pedagogical discussion on tails of green s functions in minkowski spacetimes .",
    ") this tells us that , even for 4 dimensional flat spacetime , the rigorous way to prove that light travels on the null cone is by computing the photon green s function , since it is the green s function ( via the kirchhoff representations in , and ) that determines how physical signals propagate away from their sources .    in the next section",
    ", we will review the general theory of green s functions and some geometrical constructs related to them .",
    "perturbation theory for green s functions will then be delineated in the subsequent two sections ; following that , we will apply the technology to calculate the green s functions in the kerr black hole spacetime , up to first order in its mass and angular momentum .",
    "we will conclude with thoughts on possible future investigations .",

    "we will also witness this in the perturbative framework we are about to pursue .",
    "it is appropriate at this point to highlight that these geometrical constructs , from which the light cone piece of the green s functions are built , have physical meaning for the cosmologist .",
    "for example , the world function obeys the following equation involving the van vleck determinant @xmath95 because @xmath96 is proportional to the tangent vector @xmath97 at @xmath17 ( it points in the direction of greatest rate of change in geodesic distance ) , @xmath98 describes the rate of change of the cross sectional area of the congruence of geodesics ( the  expansion \" ) through the neighborhood of @xmath17 , which via is related to the gradient of @xmath54 along the geodesics .",

    "this warrants more study .    before moving on to develop our perturbation theory ,",
    "let us take a few moments to calculate the world function , van vleck determinant and parallel propagator up to first order in @xmath81 in perturbed minkowski spacetime .",
    "this will allow us to construct the null cone piece of the scalar , photon and graviton green s function , and in turn , serve as a consistency check on our first born approximation results below .",
    "in fact , this was how kovacs and thorne @xcite constructed the null cone piece of their green s functions , by calculating separately the van vleck determinant and synge s world function .",
    "but we shall argue that this is not necessary .",
    "the born series scheme we have devised gives us a single coherent framework where all three geometric objects appearing in the null cone piece of the green s function are byproducts of the computation .",
