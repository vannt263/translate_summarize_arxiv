    "the study of three - nucleon ( 3n ) bound states and reactions in the 3n continuum has improved significantly our knowledge of the nuclear hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the underbinding of the triton and @xmath1he nuclei by modern nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions was the first evidence for the necessity of including three - nucleon forces ( 3nf )  @xcite in addition to the pairwise nn interactions .",
    "furthermore , results of green function monte - carlo calculations  @xcite showed that the energy levels of light nuclei can be explained only when the pairwise nn interactions are supplemented by appropriate 3nf s .",
    "additional evidence for 3nf effects came from the study of the cross - section minimum  @xcite in elastic nucleon - deuteron ( @xmath2 ) scattering and the deuteron vector analyzing powers  @xcite .    despite the spectacular successes obtained in interpreting 3n data based on the concept of a 3n hamiltonian with free nn interactions and supplemented by 3nf s",
    ", some dramatic discrepancies remain between theory and data that require further investigation .",
    "these discrepancies can be divided into two categories according to energy .",
    "one was discovered at incident nucleon lab energies in the 3n system above 100  mev and is exemplified by the nucleon - vector  @xcite and deuteron - tensor analyzing powers  @xcite in @xmath2 elastic scattering . since the 3nf effects become more important with increasing energy  @xcite , these discrepancies will play an important role in establishing the proper spin - isospin structure of the 3nf .",
    "the second category was found at lab energies below 40 mev . in the following",
    "we will focus on these low - energy discrepancies .",
    "the most famous is the vector analyzing power in @xmath2 elastic scattering .",
    "the theoretical predictions based on modern nn interactions , and including 3nf models , underestimate considerably the maximum of the nucleon analyzing power @xmath3 in @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath6-@xmath5 scattering , as well as the maximum of the deuteron vector analyzing power @xmath7 in @xmath8-@xmath9 scattering  @xcite . at low energies ( up to @xmath10  mev )",
    "these two observables are very sensitive to changes in the @xmath11 nn and/or in @xmath12 @xmath2 phase shifts  @xcite .",
    "even very small changes of these phase shifts result in significant variations of @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , low - energy neutron - deuteron ( @xmath13 ) breakup cross sections show clear discrepancies between theory and data  @xcite for some special kinematical arrangements of the outgoing three nucleons .",
    "the most spectacular ones are the symmetrical space - star ( sst ) and the quasi - free scattering ( qfs ) configurations .    in the sst configuration",
    "the three nucleons emerge in the c.m .",
    "system in a plane perpendicular to the incoming beam with momenta of equal magnitudes and directed such that the angle between adjacent particle momentum vectors is @xmath14 .",
    "the low - energy @xmath13 sst cross sections are clearly underestimated by theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the calculated cross sections are insensitive to the nn potential used in the calculations  @xcite .",
    "they also do not change when any one of the present - day 3nf models is included  @xcite .",
    "the qfs refers to the situation where one of the nucleons is at rest in the laboratory system . in @xmath13 breakup ,",
    "@xmath15 or @xmath16 can form a quasi - free scattered pair .",
    "both cases have been measured  @xcite .",
    "the picture resembles that for sst : the theoretical qfs cross sections are practically independent of the nn potential used in calculations , and they do not change when 3nf s are included  @xcite .",
    "the calculated qfs scattering cross section follows nicely the data when @xmath15 is the quasi - free interacting pair  @xcite . however , when the @xmath16 pair is quasi - free scattered instead of @xmath15 , the theory clearly underestimates the experimental cross sections  @xcite , similarly to the @xmath13 sst case .",
    "a problem of a different kind arises in the @xmath13 breakup final - state - interaction ( fsi ) configuration where the two outgoing nucleons have equal momenta .",
    "the cross section for this geometry is characterized by a pronounced peak when the relative energy of the final - state interacting pair reaches zero ( exact fsi condition ) . due to the large sensitivity of this enhancement to the @xmath0 nn scattering lengths ,",
    "the fsi geometry has recently been studied in @xmath13 breakup with the aim of determining the @xmath16 @xmath0 scattering length  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 fsi cross - section measurements performed simultaneously in @xcite and in two consecutive experiments in @xcite seem to indicate that indeed , this configuration is a reliable tool for determining the nn @xmath0 scattering length : the values obtained for @xmath17 agreed with the result known from free @xmath15 scattering  @xcite .",
    "however , the values obtained for @xmath18 in @xcite are in striking disagreement with each other , with the result of @xcite in excellent agreement with the accepted value for @xmath18 .",
    "all previously published 3n continuum faddeev calculations for the @xmath13 system were restricted to pure strong nuclear forces , while for the @xmath19 system the coulomb interaction between the two protons had been included in addition to the nuclear force  @xcite . however",
    ", the rigorous inclusion of the coulomb interaction is currently limited to elastic scattering .",
    "more subtle electromagnetic contributions , such as the magnetic moment interaction ( mmi ) between the nucleons have been neglected in exact faddeev calculations for the 3n continuum .",
    "the approximate calculation by stoks  @xcite at @xmath20  mev , based on a quasi two - body approach represents only the leading term of a genuine 3n calculation .",
    "since this calculation predicted only a tiny effect on @xmath3 in the region of the maximum it was generally concluded that the exact treatment of the mmi was not worth the effort .",
    "however , the speculative interpretation @xcite of new data for @xmath21-@xmath5 scattering at very low energies and the associated comparison to @xmath9-@xmath5 scattering suggested that the mmi is indeed an important ingredient in the 3n continuum .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to go beyond the approximate calculation referred to above and to study extensively the effects of the mmi on @xmath2 elastic scattering and breakup observables using the faddeev approach . even though it is very unlikely that such subtle effects will have any significant influence on the qfs and sst cross sections , we found it worthwhile to calculate the magnitude of the mmi effects for these configurations . in section",
    "ii we present the basic theoretical ingredients of our 3n calculations together with a short description of the nucleon magnetic moment interactions .",
    "the results for elastic scattering and breakup observables are presented and discussed in sections  iii and iv , respectively . in the breakup section",
    "we also focus on the consequences of the mmi effects on the extraction of the @xmath0 scattering lengths from @xmath13 breakup data .",
    "specifically , we present corrections induced by the mmi on the values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 deduced from very recent measurements .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section  v.",
    "the transition amplitudes for @xmath2 elastic scattering , @xmath22 , and breakup , @xmath23 , can be expressed in terms of the vector @xmath24 , which fulfills the 3n faddeev equation  @xcite ,    @xmath25    as    @xmath26    the incoming state @xmath27 is composed of the deuteron wave function @xmath28 and the momentum eigenstate @xmath29 of the relative nucleon - deuteron motion . for elastic scattering",
    "the outgoing relative momentum changes its direction leading to a state @xmath30 , while for the breakup reaction the final state @xmath31 is a momentum eigenstate that describes the final motion of three outgoing nucleons .",
    "the permutation operator p takes into account the identity of nucleons and it is the sum of a cyclic and anticyclic permutation of three particles . the exchange term @xmath32 ( @xmath33 denotes the free 3n propagator ) in the elastic scattering amplitude results from the interchange of the incoming nucleon with those in the deuteron .",
    "all final - state interactions between the outgoing nucleons , driven by a two - nucleon off - shell transition - matrix , that is denoted as @xmath34 in eqs .  [ e1 ] and [ e2 ] , are comprised in the t operator , as can be easily seen by iterating eq.([e1 ] ) .",
    "this formulation for nucleon - deuteron scattering assumes pairwise interactions between nucleons via a short - range force v , which generates through the lippmann - schwinger equation the transition - matrix @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , it excludes the treatment of the long - range coulomb force , but allows for the inclusion of any electromagnetic contribution of short - range character , such as , e.g. , the magnetic moment interactions ( mmi ) between nucleons . in the case of our `` @xmath19 calculations , '' the value of the magnetic moment of the two neutrons in our @xmath13 breakup calculations",
    "is replaced by the value of the proton magnetic moment , i.e. , the long - range coulomb force is not included , neither is any interference between the coulomb force and the mmi .    in our approach",
    "we solve eq.([e1 ] ) in momentum space and partial wave basis using the magnitudes of the standard jacobi momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 to describe the relative motion of the three nucleons , supplemented by angular momenta , spin , and isospin quantum numbers . due to the short - range assumption ,",
    "the result is a finite set of coupled integral equations in two continuous variables , @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "the equations are solved for the amplitudes @xmath38 for each total angular momentum j and parity of the 3n system by generating the neumann series of eq.([e1 ] ) and summing it up by the pade method .",
    "the @xmath39 is a set of angular , spin and isospin quantum numbers @xmath40 , which describes the coupling of the two - nucleon subsystem and the third nucleon to the total angular momentum j and total isospin t of the 3n system . for details of the theoretical formalism and numerical performance",
    "we refer to  @xcite .    to study effects of the mmi s of the nucleons we included in addition to the strong av18  @xcite or cd  bonn  @xcite potentials the interactions of the magnetic moments in the @xmath41 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 subsystems .",
    "the form and parametrization of the mmi s are given in eqs.(8 ) , ( 15 ) , and ( 16 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( in the case of the @xmath15 system the term @xmath42 in eq.(15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite was neglected ) .",
    "the difference of the @xmath41 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath15 interactions in isospin t=1 states induces transitions between 3n states with total isospin t=1/2 and t=3/2 .",
    "the strength of these transitions is determined through the known charge - independence breaking of the nn interactions  @xcite .",
    "this charge - independence breaking can be treated approximately by a simple `` 2/3 - 1/3 rule '' , for which the effective t=1 transition matrix is given by @xmath43 , and t=3/2 3n states are neglected .",
    "this procedure is sufficient for most of the 3n scattering observables  @xcite .",
    "since it is not evident that such an approximate approach is sufficient when the mmi s are included , we performed also calculations where for each partial wave state @xmath39 with isospin t=1 both values of the total 3n isospin t=1/2 and t=3/2 were taken into account . in all calculations we considered all basis states",
    "@xmath39 with two - nucleon subsystem angular momenta up to @xmath44 . in order to obtain full convergence of the numerical results for elastic scattering and breakup observables , eq.([e1 ] )",
    "was solved for total 3n angular momenta up to @xmath45 . under this condition",
    "the maximal number of coupled integral equations , which is equal to the number of possible @xmath39 s , amounts to 62 for the approximate approach and increases to 89 when both values of the total isospin are taken into account .",
    "the nucleon scattered off the deuteron can be either a neutron or a proton . since they have magnetic moments of different sign and magnitude , we performed separate calculations for the @xmath19 and @xmath13 systems . in both cases",
    "the @xmath41 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath15 nuclear interactions of the av18 and cd  bonn potentials were used , supplemented by the appropriate mmi s : @xmath41 and @xmath15 for the @xmath19 system , and @xmath16 and @xmath15 for the @xmath13 system .",
    "comparisons of the theoretical predictions for elastic scattering observables were made between calculations obtained with and without the mmi s included . among the unpolarized cross section , analyzing powers , spin correlation coefficients , and polarization transfer coefficients , only the vector analyzing powers [ @xmath3 and @xmath7 ] show a significant influence of the mmi s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] ,  [ fig:1b ] , and  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "as expected from the different signs of the proton and neutron magnetic moments , the effects of the mmi s have opposite signs for the @xmath19 and @xmath13 systems .    for the @xmath19 system the mmi s raise the maximum value of @xmath3 and @xmath7 by @xmath47 at @xmath48  mev , thus bringing it closer to the experimental @xmath19 data , while for the @xmath13 system they reduce the maximum of @xmath3 and @xmath7 by @xmath49 , therefore enlarging the discrepancy between theory and data .",
    "the magnitude of the mmi effects is energy dependent and decreases with increasing nucleon energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the mmi s is thus most significant at low energies .",
    "the relative magnitude of the effect is comparable for @xmath3 and @xmath7 and is roughly independent of the strong nn interaction used in the calculations .",
    "we found that the evaluation of the effects induced by the mmi s does not require partial wave components with total isospin t=3/2 .",
    "restricting the calculations to the approximate `` 2/3 - 1/3 rule '' leads to a fairly good estimate of the mmi effects .",
    "our results once again exemplify the spectacular sensitivity of the low - energy vector analyzing powers to the @xmath1p - wave interactions . in spite of the relative smallness of the mmi contributions to the potential energy of the three nucleons , their effect is amplified by this @xmath1p - wave sensitivity , and they must be taken into account in any final solution to the @xmath3 puzzle .    recent experimental data for the low - energy @xmath13 @xmath3 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51  mev ) revealed a sizable difference with respect to @xmath19 data .",
    "the difference increases with decreasing center - of - mass energy  @xcite .",
    "this energy dependence was used in @xcite to speculate that the difference between the @xmath52 and @xmath19 @xmath3 data at low energies is due to the mmi s of the three nucleons in the 3n continuum .",
    "the present work clearly supports this conjecture .",
    "the final deuteron breakup state requires 5 independent kinematical parameters to define it unambiguously .",
    "they can be taken as , e.g. , laboratory energies @xmath53 and @xmath54 of two outgoing nucleons together with their angles to define the directions of their momenta . in order to locate regions in this 5-dimensional breakup phase space with large changes of the cross section due to the mmi s of the nucleons",
    ", we applied the projection procedure described in details in ref .",
    "the magnitude of the mmi effects on the exclusive breakup cross section @xmath55 along the kinematically allowed s - curve was defined as @xmath56 we searched the entire breakup phase space for the distribution of @xmath57 values . for this purpose the phase space was projected onto three sub - planes : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . here ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 are the polar angles which together with the azimuthal angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) define the directions of the nucleon momenta .",
    "the resulting projections of @xmath57 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] at the three incoming proton energies of @xmath66 and @xmath67  mev for the @xmath68h@xmath69 breakup reaction .",
    "the largest changes found for the breakup cross sections reach @xmath70 , and even at 65  mev there are configurations with non - negligible mmi effects .",
    "the largest effects are located mostly in regions of the phase space that are characterized by fsi geometries . in most other parts of the phase space",
    "the effects of the mmi s are rather small .",
    "in particular , the sst and qfs cross sections are only slightly influenced . according to our calculations , for the qfs configuration",
    "the mmi effect depends on the laboratory angles of the quasi - free interacting nucleons and it is different for the @xmath41 , @xmath16 , or @xmath15 pairs . however , the effects are quite small . at @xmath71",
    "mev they are never larger than @xmath72 . for the sst configuration",
    "the effects are smaller than @xmath73 . changing the c.m .",
    "angle between the space - star plane and the beam axis to values different from @xmath74 results in only small changes of the cross section of less than 2% when the mmi s are included .    as stated above , the largest changes of the cross sections of up to @xmath70 occur for fsi configurations .",
    "their relative magnitude depends on the incoming beam energy and on the production angle of the final - state interacting pair ( the lab .",
    "angle between the momentum of the fsi pair and the beam axis ) .",
    "the sign of the effect depends on the type of the final - state interacting pair ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:6]-[fig:8 ] ) . for the @xmath15 fsi peak",
    "the cross section is increased and for the @xmath41 ( @xmath16 ) fsi peak it is decreased , according to the increased or decreased attraction caused by the mmi s in the corresponding nn subsystem .",
    "the relative changes of the fsi cross sections are comparable for the @xmath15 and @xmath41 fsi peaks , and are a factor of @xmath75 smaller for the @xmath16 fsi peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "this factor approximately corresponds to the ratio of the squares of the neutron and proton magnetic moments , @xmath76 .",
    "this behavior of the fsi cross sections is of interest in view of recently reported values for the @xmath0 @xmath16 and @xmath15 scattering lengths extracted from @xmath13 breakup measurements  @xcite .",
    "as stated earlier , for the @xmath15 system both measurements resulted in comparable values for @xmath17 , which agree with the value obtained from free @xmath15 scattering .",
    "however , the reported results for the @xmath18 scattering length are strikingly different . in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we show the @xmath16 and @xmath15 cross sections for the fsi configurations of ref .",
    "@xcite and in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] for the corresponding configurations of ref .",
    "@xcite , together with the effects induced by the mmi s on the fsi peaks .",
    "it is interesting to note that the theoretical cross sections for the @xmath15 fsi obtained with mmi s included do not change significantly if the @xmath15 pair is accompanied by either a @xmath16 or @xmath41 pair .",
    "this effect is slightly dependent on the production angle of the fsi pair ( see fig .  [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "this observation , together with our findings about the dependence of the @xmath16 fsi peak on the magnitude of the mmi s , indicates a relatively simple mechanism by which the mmi s affect fsi geometries , resulting in a net effect that is dominated by the magnetic moments of the fsi pair .",
    "in view of the non - negligible effects of the mmi s on fsi cross sections found in the present work one would conclude that the values reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite for the scattering lengths must be corrected for such effects .",
    "based on the sensitivity of the theoretical point - geometry fsi cross sections to specific values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the geometries of the experiments described in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , the mmi associated corrections for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 scattering lengths are shown in column 3 of tables  [ tab:1 ] and  [ tab:2 ] , respectively . while the correction to the @xmath16 scattering length is rather small , the correction to the @xmath15 scattering length moves the @xmath17 values obtained from the @xmath13 breakup reaction away from the free @xmath15 scattering result by @xmath77  fm .",
    "the corrections given in tables  [ tab:1 ] and  [ tab:2 ] are for point geometry , i.e. , they do not include the finite geometry of the experimental setup and the associated energy smearing .",
    "such sizeable corrections , especially for @xmath17 , if true , would cast doubt on the accuracy of previous results obtained from the @xmath13 breakup reaction . evidence that this is not the case is shown in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "this table contains the effects of including the mmi s with the av18 and the cd bonn nn potentials in 2n calculations of the @xmath78s@xmath79 scattering length .",
    "the inclusion of the mmi s increases the magnitude of @xmath17 , while for the @xmath41 and @xmath16 systems , it decreases the magnitude of the scattering lengths .",
    "the magnitudes of changes for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nearly equal and opposite in sign to the corrections found for the 3n system ( see column 3 in tables  [ tab:1 ] and  [ tab:2 ] and column 5 in table  [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the effective corrections , given by their sum , are nearly negligible .",
    "the final corrected values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given in column 4 of tables  [ tab:1 ] and  [ tab:2 ] , respectively .",
    "clearly , the mmi s do not explain the different values for @xmath18 obtained in the measurements of  @xcite and  @xcite . as a side remark one should mention a shortfall of the @xmath15 @xmath78s@xmath79 scattering length used in the cd bonn potential .",
    "it was fitted to the experimental value of @xmath17 obtained from free @xmath21-@xmath9 scattering without taking the mmi into account .",
    "we performed an extensive study of effects induced by the magnetic moment interactions of nucleons in the 3n continuum . for elastic @xmath2 scattering we found that only the vector analyzing powers show significant changes when the mmi s are included . for the @xmath13 system the mmi s increase the discrepancy between calculations and data for @xmath3 in the region of the @xmath3 maximum , while for the @xmath19 system they reduce the discrepancy .",
    "the effects for @xmath80 are similar .",
    "the relative magnitude of the mmi effects decreases with increasing energy .",
    "the recent low - energy @xmath13 @xmath3 data support the action of the mmi @xcite .",
    "our results show that any final solution of the @xmath3 puzzle must incorporate the mmi s of the nucleons involved .    for the @xmath2 breakup cross sections",
    "the regions where the mmi s are important are restricted to fsi geometries , where changes of the cross sections of up to @xmath70 were found .",
    "such large effects originate from modifications of the @xmath0 scattering lengths caused by the mmi s , to which the fsi cross sections are sensitive . due to these modifications when extracting scattering length from breakup measurement",
    "the mmi s can be neglected in the underlying theory , i.e. , the resulting effective corrections are practically negligible .",
    "therefore , the very minor mmi corrections found in the present work do not explain the different values for the @xmath0 @xmath18 obtained in recent @xmath13 breakup experiments . from the theoretical point of view , the @xmath78s@xmath79 scattering lengths @xmath18 and @xmath17 can be reliably determined from experimental data , provided the mmi s are treated consistently on the nn _ and _ 3n level . if the mmi s are included in only one of these levels , the associated results for the scattering lengths must be corrected appropriately .    in most regions of the phase space @xmath2 breakup cross sections",
    "are influenced only slightly by the mmi s .",
    "in particular , this is the case for the qfs and sst configurations .",
