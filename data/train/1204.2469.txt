    "the quenching of jets associated with the strong suppression of the yields of high transverse momentum hadrons in comparison with proton - proton collisions has been observed experimentally in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider at bnl  @xcite and at the large hadron collider at cern , cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "originally , such a signal was predicted by bjorken  @xcite as an evidence for the formation of a deconfined plasma state of qcd matter , in which propagating partons suffer from an enhanced in - medium energy loss .",
    "considered as dominant contribution , the radiative energy loss of relativistic partons due to medium - induced gluon radiation was , for instance , studied in  @xcite .",
    "important for the discussion of bremsstrahlung in a dense medium are possible coherence effects . these lead to a suppression of the radiation spectrum compared to the spectrum due to incoherent scatterings .",
    "this was first realized by landau , pomeranchuk  @xcite and migdal  @xcite who studied in qed the possibility of a destructive interference of radiation amplitudes , which stem from multiple scatterings of an electric charge traversing dense matter , within the formation time of radiation ( lpm effect ) .",
    "this effect was later generalized to qcd in  @xcite .",
    "likewise important are modifications of the radiation spectrum due to the dielectric polarization of the medium , which is known as the ter - mikaelian ( tm ) effect  @xcite .",
    "the medium polarization results in a change of the dispersion relation of the radiated quanta . in this way",
    ", the spectrum becomes regulated in the soft and collinear regions . in qcd ,",
    "the tm effect on the radiation spectrum was investigated by considering bremsstrahlung gluons with a finite in - medium mass  @xcite .",
    "the concept of a formation time ( or length ) of radiation turned out to be extremely fruitful for the discussion of radiative energy losses  @xcite .",
    "it allows for a semi - quantitative understanding of the pattern of the radiation spectra .",
    "the spectrum reduction due to the lpm effect , for example , was qualitatively analyzed in this way for qed in  @xcite and for qcd in the review  @xcite : if the radiation formation length , which depends on the energy @xmath0 of the emitted quantum and on the properties of the dense medium ( e.g. the transport coefficient @xmath1 ) , is large compared to the mean free path in the medium , multiple scatterings will contribute coherently to the emission of a single radiation quantum .",
    "this represents the lpm regime of coherent radiation . in the opposite case ,",
    "radiation quanta will be formed independently at each individual scattering .",
    "this represents the bethe - heitler ( bh ) regime of incoherent radiation .    in this work ,",
    "we extend this analysis in order to include damping phenomena within an absorptive medium into the discussion .",
    "the latter are responsible for a reduction of the radiative energy loss of the charge and the associated radiative energy loss spectrum as was recently studied in  @xcite .",
    "we stress that this behaviour is not a simple consequence of the rather trivial reduction of any radiation spectrum in the far distance due to the absorption of already formed radiation but a result of the effect which damping has on the creation of the radiation itself .",
    "just as the tm effect alters the radiation probability in the soft part of the spectrum  @xcite , damping mechanisms lead also to a modification of the probability for emitting bremsstrahlung . this can be understood by viewing the formation of bremsstrahlung to be hampered by damping effects , in particular , when formation times become large .",

    "damping effects become influential at intermediate @xmath93 , where for @xmath212 a region of multiple damped scatterings and for @xmath213 a region of single damped scatterings emerges . again , the spectrum suppression in the regions ( md ) and ( sd ) is stronger than in the regime ( mu ) , in which coherence effects dominate the radiation spectrum .",
    "damping phenomena specific to hot qcd matter become important for the radiative energy loss of an energetic parton , when they start to influence the formation process of the bremsstrahlung gluons .",
    "the gluon damping rate is related to the imaginary part of the poles in the corresponding in - medium propagator  @xcite . in perturbative qcd approaches",
    ", it has been calculated both for collective gluon modes in the plasma  @xcite as well as for hard gluons  @xcite . for collective gluons with momenta and energies of @xmath345 both elastic and inelastic processes",
    "contribute equally to a damping rate @xmath346 . in case of a hard gluon with either momentum or energy of @xmath347 or larger",
    "only elastic processes have been considered in the evaluation of the gluon damping rate in  @xcite , yielding @xmath348 for @xmath254 .",
    "however , elastic rescatterings of a bremsstrahlung gluon during its formation are already taken into account by @xmath233 in our considerations .",
    "the nature of the damping mechanisms we have in mind here is different : as possible inelastic processes leading to a damping of gluon radiation , one might consider either quark  anti - quark pair production or secondary bremsstrahlung creation from a gluon during its formation process .    for estimating the parametric dependence of the latter process , one might view the emission of the secondary bremsstrahlung gluon in the dense medium as a bdmps - mechanism  @xcite . in doing so , a preformed gluon with fractional energy @xmath289 , which is ,",
    "however , small compared to @xmath94 , emits a secondary bremsstrahlung gluon of fractional energy @xmath349 in an inelastic scattering process . in order to be of influence on the formation of the preformed gluon ,",
    "the formation time of the secondary gluon must be small compared to the formation time of its emitter , which can be realized if @xmath350 , cf .",
    "[ fig:4new ] .",
    "the production rate for the secondary gluon as a measure for the damping rate of the preformed emitter gluon is obtained by integrating the weighted bdmps - radiation spectrum  @xcite . neglecting the part in the integral , which is suppressed with @xmath351 ,",
    "one finds a gluon damping rate @xmath352 up to corrections of order @xmath353 .",
    "we note that a similar parametric dependence was found in  @xcite for the gluon production rate , which is of interest for the chemical equilibration of the hot qcd plasma .",
    "for such a damping rate , the case @xmath266 would be realized in pqcd , leading to the situation depicted in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:5new ] .",
    "damping phenomena in a dense , absorptive plasma can influence substantially the radiative energy loss of an energetic charge traversing this medium .",
    "they manifest themselves in a non - trivial reduction of the associated radiation spectrum off that charge as compared to the spectrum from incoherent scatterings in non - absorptive matter .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for large energies @xmath6 ( or equivalently large lorentz - factors @xmath95 ) of the charge and/or large damping rates @xmath12 of the radiated quanta in the medium .",
    "this behaviour can be understood semi - quantitatively by making use of the concept of a formation time for radiation : damping mechanisms reduce the radiative energy loss spectrum if the typical time scale for the damping of radiation quanta with fractional energy @xmath90 is small compared to their formation time such that these effects influence already the creation of the radiation .    in this article",
    ", we analyzed systematically the interplay between these competing time scales for an absorptive qed and qcd medium .",
    "we started with the case of a polarizable and absorptive , infinite electro - magnetic plasma , for which analytical results for the radiative energy loss spectrum per unit length have been derived in  @xcite .",
    "then , we extended the phenomenological discussion to qcd matter .",
    "this is the first time that the consequences of damping are studied in qcd as in perturbative qcd approaches damping phenomena were so far considered as negligible , higher - order effects .    in both cases , i.e.  qed and qcd",
    ", we identified parametrically the regions in @xmath95-@xmath93-space , in which either coherence or damping effects significantly influence the associated radiation spectrum , cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig:2newplus ] ,  [ fig:5new ]  and  [ fig:5 + 1new ] .",
    "we showed that , generically , damping effects become important in an intermediate-@xmath93 regime , which grows with increasing @xmath95 and/or @xmath12 .",
    "any suppression of the spectrum in this regime has to be attributed to damping phenomena rather than coherence effects .",
    "we showed that the radiation spectrum is stronger suppressed through damping effects than it is through coherence effects . restricting our analysis for qcd matter to the case of heavy quarks , we visualized this feature in figs .  [ fig:6new ] and  [ fig:9 ] by using typical values for the entering parameters . the utilized concept should , however , be generalizable to the study of light partons as well .",
    "as damping effects become pronounced for large @xmath95 , the study of hadronic correlations at high transverse momenta @xmath354 might open the avenue for experimentally measuring the absorptive properties of hot qcd matter .",
    "moreover , the effect could be a key ingredient for the understanding of the observed heavy meson spectra : if @xmath53 becomes the dominant scale , the radiation spectra turn out to be mass - independent , which would constitute a step towards solving the non - photonic single - electron puzzle  @xcite .",
    "corresponding phenomenological investigations are presented in  @xcite , where the quark - mass independence of the heavy - flavor meson quenching at large @xmath354 is quantified and a comparison with the available experimental data from the alice collaboration on the @xmath355 meson quenching suggests a rather strong damping rate @xmath356 .",
    "also , we expect our results to be of relevance in heavy - quark tagged jet physics : on the one hand , either the finite in - medium gluon mass @xmath220 or the parameter @xmath357 represent a natural lower energy cutoff for bremsstrahlung gluons in the soft region of the spectrum . damping effects ,",
    "on the other hand , hamper the formation of hard or intermediate hard gluons , providing effectively an upper limit for the radiative energy loss of an energetic projectile , similar to coherence effects but with a stronger impact on the power spectra .    in this work",
    ", we neglected the consideration of any dependence on a finite path length @xmath358 .",
    "nevertheless , whether the energetic charge is created in the remote past or originating from the interior bulk of a thick medium , only quanta with a formation length smaller than the distance @xmath358 travelled by the charge can contribute to the medium - induced radiative energy loss , cf .",
    "this implies that in the regions of @xmath95-@xmath93-space , in which damping effects are relevant , finite path length effects play no additional role for the radiation spectrum off these charges . following the heuristic arguments presented in  @xcite",
    ", we expect that the averaged radiative energy loss of such partons in the hot qcd plasma is proportional to @xmath359 in case @xmath360 . only for partons stemming from the outer crust of the medium of thickness @xmath361",
    "finite path length effects are important and the averaged radiative energy loss is proportional to @xmath362 .",
    "we considered , moreover , @xmath93-independent damping rates in our analysis .",
    "in general , however , @xmath12 should depend on the energy of the radiation quanta .",
    "we leave such studies for future investigations .",
