    "after decades of efforts , the fundamental properties of type ia supernova ( sn ) progenitors still remain obscure ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the reason is simple : although hundreds of new type ia sne are discovered each year , their host galaxies are too far away to either detect the the faint progenitors in pre - explosion images @xcite or study the stellar populations around the explosions with enough detail .",
    "most of the times , all that can be learned from the study of the hosts is an average age and metallicity for the _ entire _ galaxy @xcite .    focusing on local group galaxies has the advantage that the stellar populations can be resolved and studied in exquisite detail . waiting for sne to explode in these galaxies is obviously not practical , but there is no need for that .",
    "recent advances in our understanding of the x - ray emission from type ia supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite have made it possible to determine the fundamental properties of type ia sne by studying their snrs ( see @xcite for an example ) . in some cases it has been possible to verify the results obtained from the snr with the spectroscopy of the light",
    "echoes associated with the parent sn itself ( e.g. @xcite for the case of snr 0509@xmath067.5 ) .",
    "we take advantage of these techniques to study the stellar star formation history ( sfh ) map of the lmc published by @xcite , which was produced by applying the starfish code @xcite to the data from the magellanic clouds photometric survey @xcite .    67.5  ( left panel ) and n103b ( right panel ) , broken down in four metallicity bins .",
    "the grey area corresponds to the error bar on the total sfh .",

    "we show the sfhs associated with two of the four type ia snrs in our study . from both its x - ray spectrum @xcite and the sn light echo @xcite ,",
    "snr 0509@xmath067.5  is known to have been originated by an exceptionally bright , sn 1991-t like type ia sn .",
    "however , the stellar population around it is very old ( average age 7.9 gyr ) and metal - poor ( average @xmath1 0.0014 ) .",
    "the snr is located in a region of the lmc called the northwestern void , very far away from any sites of recent star formation @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the prevalent view that bright type ia sne come from younger and possibly more massive progenitors @xcite .",
    "the situation for snr n103b is very different .",
    "the sfh is dominated by a vigorous episode of recent star formation , with one extended peak between 50 and 100 myr ago and a more brief outburst 12 myr ago .",
    "this type ia snr might have had a more massive and younger progenitor than snr 0509@xmath067.5 ."
