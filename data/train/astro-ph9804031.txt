    "the overall electromagnetic spectra of blazars  a class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that includes bl lac objects and optically violently variable ( ovv ) quasars  are believed to be dominated by doppler - boosted radiation from relativistic jets pointing closely to our line of sight ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for a review of radio loud agns ) .",
    "the vlbi studies of these objects show compact radio cores on milli - arcsecond angular scale with jet - like structures which often show superluminal motion , with apparent speeds @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "apparent variability time scale and luminosity amplification depend on various powers of the `` beaming '' ( doppler ) factor @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , defined via @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting matter , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the angle of motion with respect to the line of sight .",
    "blazars are commonly detected as @xmath3ray sources .",
    "the egret instrument onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) has so far detected emission in the gev range from @xmath14 50 blazars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; @xmath3ray emission has been detected up to the tev range from the nearby bl lac objects mkn  421 and mkn  501 with ground - based cherenkov telescopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as these sources show large luminosity and compact emission regions in the spectral range where the opacity to pair production via @xmath15 is large , it is generally accepted that the @xmath3ray emission is anisotropic and doppler - boosted as well ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the _ entire _ observed electromagnetic emission arises in the jet . as these objects emit in practically every observable waveband , any study of the structure and physical conditions in the jets requires broad - band spectral observations , which , given the rapid large amplitude flux variability , must be conducted simultaneously .",
    "the overall spectra of blazars have two pronounced components : one peaking at low energies ( le ) , @xmath16 hz ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and another peaking at high energies ( he ) , in the @xmath3rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the blazars that are hosted in quasars ( qhbs ) , and for bl lac objects discovered via radio - selection techniques ( the so - called `` low - energy peaked bl lacs '' or lbls ) , the le component peaks in the infrared . for",
    "the the majority of bl lac objects  those found as a result of their x  ray emission ",
    "it peaks in the ultraviolet or even in the soft x",
    " rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thus they are named `` high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) '' ( @xcite ) . the local power - law shape , the smooth connection of the entire radio - to - uv ( and , for the hbls , soft x  ray ) continuum , as well as the relatively high level of polarization observed from radio to the uv ,",
    "imply that the emission from the le component is most likely produced via the synchrotron process of relativistic particles radiating in magnetic field .",
    "this view is strongly supported by spectral variability observed in x ",
    "rays in a number of hbls , where the variability at lower x  ray energies lags behind the more energetic x  rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )    the he component , on the other hand , peaks in the @xmath3ray band , in the mev - to - gev range , and , in the case of a few hbls , it extends to the tev range ; it is believed to be produced via comptonization by the same particles that radiate the le component .",
    "the source of the `` seed '' photons , can either be the synchrotron radiation , internal to the jet  as in the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . alternatively",
    ", these can be external to the jet , as in the external radiation compton ( erc ) models : either the uv accretion disk photons ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or these uv photons reprocessed by the emission line clouds and/or intercloud medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or else , ir radiation ambient to the host galaxy ( @xcite ) . the ratio of the power in the he to the le components is systematically larger for qhbs than for bl lac objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that the le component is due to the synchrotron radiation , its peak frequency is determined by the intensity of magnetic field and the distribution function of electron energies , while the location of the he peak is related to the distribution functions of electron and target photon energies .",
    "the ratio of the luminosity of these components ( @xmath17 ) , in the context of this synchrotron plus compton model , is expected to reflect the ratio of energy densities of photon and magnetic fields in the jet .",
    "this paper reports the x  ray spectra of 18 blazars measured by _",
    "asca _ in the context of their multi - band emission .",
    "the _ asca _ observations and results are described in  2 , followed by multi - band analysis and discussion in  3 .",
    "summary of this paper is presented in  4 . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath18=75 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20=0.5 .",
    "x  ray satellite _ asca _ ( @xcite ) observed 18 blazars ( cf . table 1 ) , half of which were also observed contemporaneously with egret as parts of multiband campaigns ; such simultaneous observing campaigns are essential for these highly variable objects .",
    "we applied the standard screening criteria to the data .",
    "the minimum cutoff rigidity is 6 gev / c .",
    "the minimum elevation angle is 10 and 5 degree respectively for the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( hereafter sis ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum angle between the target and the illuminated earth s limb is 20 degree for the sis .",
    "we rejected the data obtained during the passages through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "we extract the source counts from a region of a radii of 3 arcmin and 46 arcmin respectively .",
    "for the gis we chose a radius in proportion to the brightness of a source as long as the ratio of signal to background is one .",
    "the background counts were taken from a source - free region in the same image as the target for a source whose source count rate is below 0.2 cts s@xmath19 . for sources",
    "whose count rate is above 0.2 cts s@xmath19 , there is no image region where contamination from the source is negligible . for those cases",
    ", we took background from the same detector region as the location of the source , but from blank sky observations .",
    "we fitted the spectra using the detector response v1.1@xmath21 for sis and v4.0 for gis , by a power law with absorption at low energies ( cross section from @xcite ) . in most cases ,",
    "the data were well - described by this model , where the absorption was consistent with the galactic value , although for hbls the spectra are convex and this model is too simple ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . but in all cases , a power law model with galactic absorption suffices in the 2 - 10 kev range . when there is more than one _ asca",
    "_ observation during one viewing period of egret , we used an index determined from the summed data over the period of contemporaneous observations with egret .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the 2 - 10 kev energy indices of the blazars obtained with _",
    "asca_. this figure clearly shows that the x  ray spectra of hbls are the softest , with the power law energy index @xmath0 , and they form the highest observable energy tail of the le component .",
    "x  ray spectra of the qhbs are the hardest ( @xmath1 ) and are consistent with the lowest observable energy end ( `` onset '' ) of the he component . for lbls , the x",
    " ray spectra are intermediate ; in one case , 0716 + 714 , the _ asca _ spectrum shows hardening with an increasing energy ( fig .",
    "2 ) , similar to the spectrum observed with _ rosat _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the differences in the spectra between three subclasses were also observed with _",
    "rosat _ in the soft x  ray band ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the time variability in _ asca _ observations",
    "is reported in kubo ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that while the energy index for hbls is often variable on a short time scale , for qhbs the index remains almost constant when the flux changes .",
    "we constructed the multiband spectral energy distribution ranging from radio to @xmath3ray band for 18 sources observed with _",
    "asca _ using above data , published results , the database and the data taken by private communication .",
    "the @xmath22-corrected multiband spectra are shown in fig .",
    "2 . for the @xmath22-correction",
    ", the flux densities are multiplied by @xmath23 , where @xmath21 is the energy spectral index at frequency @xmath24 , defined such that flux @xmath25 .",
    "we used individual spectral indices when available , otherwise average indices for each subclass of blazars ( @xcite ) .",
    "we plot the simultaneous data when available , and for non - simultaneous data we averaged the flux densities at a given frequency . in order to determine the peak frequency and the luminosity of both the le and he components",
    ", we performed a empirical third - order polynomial fit to the spectra in @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results are listed in table 2 .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show that , for qhbs , the peak frequency of the le component is lower , @xmath27 and the @xmath28 ratio is greater than that measured in hbls .",
    "for lbls , these properties are , again , intermediate .",
    "as we mentioned previously , the two leading models of the high energy emission in blazars invoke comptonization , of internal ( ssc ) or external ( erc ) seed photons . in the following analysis",
    ", we assume that _ both _ ssc and erc processes may operate in blazars .",
    "we then estimate the contribution of the ssc emission in the he component . in order to calculate the predicted luminosity due to the ssc emission , we assume a simple homogeneous model , in which photons are produced in a region of radius @xmath29 and with a constant magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "we considered the radiation by a single population of relativistic electrons , with a broken power law distribution of lorentz factors @xmath30 , and a break point at @xmath5 ( similar to e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume that the radiation spectrum of the le component peaks at a frequency corresponding to that radiated by the electrons with @xmath5 .    the peak frequency of the synchrotron component in the observer frame , @xmath31 ,",
    "is then given as , when pitch angle is @xmath32/2 : @xmath33    where b is in gauss .",
    "if the electron energy is still in the thomson regime , ( @xmath34 ) , the expected peak of the ssc component in the observer frame ( @xmath35 ) is @xmath36 .",
    "the ratio of the observed luminosity of the ssc component @xmath37 to the observed synchrotron luminosity @xmath38 is : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 is the rest - frame energy density of the synchrotron photons , and @xmath41 is the magnetic field energy density .    to check the validity of the assumption that the observed he component is solely due to the ssc emission , we calculated the beaming factor ( @xmath2 ) , which is given from above equations : @xmath42    where @xmath43 is in erg  s@xmath19 , @xmath24 in hz , @xmath44 in cm s@xmath19 , and @xmath29 in cm .",
    "we estimate @xmath29 from the shortest observed variability ( doubling ) time scale @xmath45 observed in any wavelength , as given in table 2 . assuming that @xmath46 , then eq .",
    "3 can be rewritten as : @xmath47    where @xmath45 is in s , and other quantities are as in eq .",
    "an application of this equation to the data in table 2 assuming @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 implies that the lower limits of @xmath2 for hbls are @xmath523 or less , which is consistent with the vlbi results ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the limits obtained from the arguments of the @xmath3ray opacity ( cf .",
    "however , for 4 qhbs , where the @xmath3ray flux severely dominates the radiative output , we derive values of @xmath2 that are much larger than the vlbi results ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this suggests that an additional emission mechanism  such as the erc process  may contribute significantly in the @xmath3ray regime , dominating over the ssc flux , and the values of @xmath35 and @xmath37 are _ very _ different than @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with the ssc component `` hidden '' well below the erc component .",
    "however , the fact that the qhbs have x  ray spectra which are hard , with @xmath1 , and which are _ not _ located on the extrapolation of the synchrotron optical / uv spectra , implies that the x ",
    "rays observed in qhbs are due to a separate emission process than synchrotron .",
    "the fact that for most of qhbs the @xmath3ray spectra are above the extrapolation of x  ray spectra ( fig .",
    "2 ) suggests that the dominant process is different for x ",
    "rays than it is for @xmath3rays .",
    "one explanation is that the ssc process dominates in the x  ray range , while the erc process dominates in @xmath3rays ( @xcite ) . with the assumption that ssc process is dominant in x ",
    "rays for qhbs , we estimate the location of the ( @xmath35 , @xmath37 ) point in the log(@xmath24 ) ",
    "log(@xmath26 ) space by the following method .",
    "we assume that it lays on or below the extrapolation of the _ asca _ spectrum ( line ( a ) in fig .",
    "3 ) , but above the highest value of @xmath26 measured by _",
    "asca_. since the spectra of qhbs generally have @xmath55 and thus @xmath26 is the highest at the end of the _ asca _ bandpass ( 10 kev @xmath56 2@xmath5710@xmath58hz ) , this second limit is equivalent to @xmath59 hz @xmath60 ( line ( b ) in fig .",
    "we further constrain @xmath37 using eq .",
    "3 ; once we assume a given @xmath2 , there is a unique relationship between @xmath37 and @xmath35 described as : @xmath61 where @xmath43 , @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath24 are in the same units as in eqs 3 & 4 .",
    "the vlbi data and @xmath3-ray opacity argument suggest that @xmath62 for most blazars ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to the lines ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "3 , respectively for @xmath2=5 and 20 .",
    "the above four constraints correspond to the shaded area of fig .",
    "3 , where for illustration , we use the overall spectral energy distribution for the qhb cta  102 .",
    "since we have to use a unique value in calculating the physical parameters , we use @xmath2 = 10 as a geometrical mean between 5 and 20 . the @xmath37 - @xmath35 line calculated from eq .",
    "5 corresponding to @xmath2 = 10 intersects both the extrapolation of the _ asca _ spectrum and the highest _ asca _ value , and the intersections yield the lower and upper values for both @xmath37 and @xmath35 .",
    "we adopt a mean of these values , which are given in table 2 , and plotted in figure 4c .",
    "we used _ ginga _",
    "data instead of _ asca _ data for 3c  279 because a simultaneous campaign from radio to @xmath3ray bands was conducted during _",
    "ginga _ observation .",
    "the values for the other blazars where @xmath2 derived from eq .",
    "[ eqn4 ] is @xmath63 , are calculated by assuming @xmath37 = @xmath54 . for lbl ao0235 + 164 where @xmath2 derived from eq .",
    "4 is @xmath64 , we assume @xmath37 = @xmath65 because the _ asca _ spectra of ao0235 + 164 is thought to be mixture of the le and he component , as discussed by @xcite based on the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ spectra , so that the above method may be inappropriate . for two qhbs ( 3c  273 , pks  0208 - 512 ) the lower limits of @xmath2 are @xmath145 . the fact that observed @xmath3-ray flux of pks  0208 - 512 is much higher than the extrapolation of _ asca _ spectrum implies the @xmath3-ray peak is not solely due to ssc mechanism .",
    "therefore we applied the above method to this source . on the other hand ,",
    "since the @xmath3-ray spectrum of 3c  273 is below the extrapolation of _ asca _ spectrum , the @xmath3-ray emission is assumed to be due to ssc mechanism so there , we assume @xmath37 = @xmath54 . it is important to note , however , that 3c  273 is unique",
    "as compared to other blazars considered here in that the `` blue bump '' is very pronounced , and thus it is unlikely that the jet dominates the entire electromagnetic emission , and therefore , a more complex analysis is necessary ( see , e.g. , @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "once we obtain @xmath37 , and @xmath35 , we can calculate the strength of the magnetic field and the electron lorentz factor @xmath5 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , ( [ eqn2 ] ) and those are given as follows : @xmath66 @xmath67^{-1/4}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is size of emission region in parsecs , and other quantities are as in eqs 3 , 4 , & 5 . as before , the upper limit of the size @xmath29 can be estimated from the observed time variability ( @xmath45 ) from table 2 , given by @xmath69 .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are plotted respectively in figures 4d and 4e . in these figures ,",
    "we also plot the values calculated with @xmath70 pc , which would correspond to an observed variability time scale of @xmath71 day .    from our analysis ,",
    "the magnetic field for blazars observed with _",
    "is inferred to be 0.1  1 gauss .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is comparable between the different subclasses of blazars , although @xmath4 is somewhat lower in hbls than in qhbs . with these values of @xmath4",
    ", we estimate @xmath5 to be @xmath72 for qhbs , and @xmath73 for hbls .",
    "the differences of @xmath5 between different sub - classes of blazars imply that the relativistic electrons are accelerated to higher energies in hbls than in qhbs .",
    "alternatively , higher @xmath5 in hbls might be obtained by increasing @xmath2 . however , in those objects , we believe that there is no contribution to the @xmath3ray production from other mechanisms besides ssc , and thus the observed @xmath54 is @xmath37 .",
    "in such case , @xmath5 depends on @xmath2 only linearily ( cf . eq . 7 and @xmath74 ) , and thus varying @xmath2 to be 5 or 20 respectively decreases or increases our derived @xmath5 only by a factor of two , which is small when compared to the large difference of @xmath5 calculated by us ( cf . fig .",
    "4e ) .    in qhbs",
    "the strong optical and uv line emission implies a presence of dense external radiation fields .",
    "this means that in the frame of reference of the jet , these can easily dominate over the internal synchrotron radiation , resulting in the erc emission dominating over the ssc emission in @xmath3ray band ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that the difference of @xmath5 is most likely due to the large photon density in qhbs as compared with that of hbls .",
    "it should be noted that tev photons have been observed only from hbls , where we calculate higher values of @xmath5 .",
    "the non - thermal emission from blazars , observed from radio to gev / tev @xmath3rays , is thought to be the result of radiation of very energetic particles via both synchrotron and compton processes .",
    "the overall spectra of all blazars over this wide range of energies appear similar from one object to another , forming two distinct peaks in the @xmath6 representation .",
    "the x  ray regime is important , as it is where the emission due to both processes overlaps : for the high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , x ",
    "rays form the high energy tail of the synchrotron emission , while for blazars showing quasar - like emission lines ( qhbs ) , they form the lowest observable energy end of the comptonized spectrum .",
    "the x  ray spectra of low - energy peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) appear intermediate , which may depend on the level of activity of the object .",
    "an application of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model to the overall spectral distribution and variability data of 18 blazars observed by _ asca _ implies that for the hbls , the ssc model can explain all available data quite well , and implies relativistic doppler factors @xmath2 in the range of 5 - 20 , consistent with the those derived from the vlbi data and from the limits inferred from @xmath3ray opacity to pair production , @xmath15 .",
    "further support for it comes from the good agreement of values physical parameters of the radiating plasma as inferred from the energetics requirement to produce the tev @xmath3rays , with that inferred from the spectral variability observed in x ",
    "rays in a number of objects .",
    "the situation in qhbs ( and in some lbls ) is quite different , as the application of the ssc model implies the values of @xmath2 much in excess of values inferred from the @xmath3ray opacity arguments , or the vlbi data .",
    "this discrepancy can be eliminated if we adopt a scenario where the observed gev @xmath3rays are produced by comptonization of external photons ( via the erc process ) , while the flux produced by the ssc process  while present and possibly responsible for the x  ray emission  in the gev range is well below the erc emission . with this",
    "we estimated the @xmath37 of qhbs , by assuming x  ray emission in _ asca _ band is due to ssc process .",
    "the inferred magnetic fields in all blazars is comparable ",
    "@xmath14 0.1 to 1 gauss ",
    "but , what distinguishes qhbs and hbls is the much lower value of lorentz factors of electrons radiating at the peak , @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath75 for qhbs against @xmath76 for hbls .",
    "however , the details of the jet structure , and in particular , the question of the particle acceleration , still remain open , with the hope that the future missions  such as the upcoming satellites _",
    "astro - e _ and _ glast _  will further advance our knowledge of the details of physical processes in these extreme , enigmatic objects .",

    "<S> we present data for 18 blazars observed with the x  ray satellite _ asca _ , half of which were also observed contemporaneously with the egret instrument onboard _ </S>",
    "<S> compton gamma - ray observatory _ as parts of multi - wavelength campaigns . </S>",
    "<S> the observations show a clear difference in the spectra between three subclasses of blazars , namely the high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , low - energy peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) , and quasar - hosted blazars ( qhbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the _ asca _ </S>",
    "<S> x  ray spectra of hbls are the softest , with the power law energy index @xmath0 , and they form the highest observable energy tail of the low energy ( le , synchrotron ) component . the x  ray spectra of the qhbs are the hardest ( @xmath1 ) and are consistent with the lowest observable energy end of the high energy ( he , compton ) component . for lbls , the x  ray spectra are intermediate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the radiation process responsible for the he peak for hbls _ can _ be explained solely by doppler - boosted synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) emission , with the doppler factor @xmath2 consistent with the vlbi and/or @xmath3ray variability data . </S>",
    "<S> for many qhbs , on the other hand , the @xmath3rays _ can not _ be solely due to the ssc mechanism unless @xmath2 is significantly in excess of that inferred from vlbi data . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an alternative scenario consistent with the measured values of @xmath2 , where the ssc component is still present in qhbs and it dominates in the x  ray band , but it is below the observed @xmath3ray spectrum . with an assumption that the peak of the ssc emission is on the extrapolation of the x  ray spectrum , and adopting @xmath2 of 10 , we infer the magnetic field @xmath4 to be 0.1  1 gauss , and lorentz factors @xmath5 of electrons radiating at the peak of the @xmath6 spectrum of @xmath7 for qhbs ; this is much lower than @xmath8 for hbls , even though the values of @xmath4 are comparable in the two sub - classes . </S>",
    "<S> this difference of @xmath5 is most likely due to the large photon density expected in qhbs ( e.g. from thermal components visible in these objects ) as compared with that of hbls ; compton upscattering of these photons may well provide the observed gev flux . </S>"
