    "a large gap in our understanding of fundamental physics is the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation . among the many ideas developed to explain this phenomena",
    ", the most economical explanation postulates the existence of a single scalar higgs boson .",
    "this simple explanation has been remarkably successful , in that all precision electroweak data is compatible with it , yet not compatible with many other more complicated explanations of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .    despite the success of the single higgs boson theory ,",
    "there are two challenges .",
    "first , there are theoretical problems explaining the large hierarchy of fundamental scales ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) . and second , we have yet to find the higgs boson in experiment .    the standard model ( sm ) higgs properties are completely fixed in terms of only one parameter , its mass .",
    "unfortunately , the mass can not be predicted .",
    "precision measurements have constrained the higgs boson mass to be below @xmath9 at the 95% c.l .",
    "( see p.  101 of  @xcite ) .",
    "direct searches in @xmath10 have constrained the higgs boson to have mass above @xmath11 at the 95% c.l .",
    "the remaining @xmath12 window of possible higgs mass is relatively narrow and proposals for future experiments have focused heavily on this region .",
    "nevertheless , a light higgs boson below @xmath9 is not guaranteed for several reasons .",
    "first , precision electroweak data is sensitive mostly to the logarithm of the higgs boson mass , and small changes in the @xmath13 fit can yield large changes in the allowed higgs mass . using the `` all data '' fit from table 13.2 of the lep electroweak working group summary report  @xcite , which concludes that _ 10(m_h / gev)=1.94^+0.21_-0.22   ( all  data  lepewwg  fit ) , we can deduce that the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) upper bound on the higgs mass is about @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . a true value @xmath15 away from the experimentally determined central value is by no means out of the question .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that a much heavier higgs boson can conspire with new states ( @xmath18 bosons , new scalars , etc . ) to be compatible with the precision electroweak data  @xcite . in this article",
    "we will not focus on the statistics and solidity of the present higgs boson mass limits .",
    "instead , our main purpose is to determine how much information can be learned about a theory from the higgs boson mass whatever it might turn out to be .",
    "we frame our discussion by first assuming that a higgs boson exists that couples to sm states in the well - defined sm way .",
    "we then wish to explore what different values of the higgs boson would imply for supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric gauge unification theories .",
    "our last ingredient is to take into consideration an infinite set of possible unification scenarios parametrized by the value of @xmath19 at the unification scale @xmath20 .",
    "most of the previous discussions on higgs mass limits have relied strongly on high - energy unification ( @xmath21 ) . in our analysis ,",
    "the scale @xmath20 ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "many years ago it was discovered that the sm fermions fit very nicely into two representations of @xmath24 and one representation of @xmath25 . unifying the sm gauge groups",
    "also gives explanation to the unusual values of the hypercharges .",
    "grand unification theories ( guts ) based on these two groups gained considerable attention and are still of value today .",
    "non - supersymmetric @xmath26 guts have at least three major challenges .",
    "they have no explanation for the huge hierarchy between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the gauge couplings do not precisely meet at any point at higher energy .",
    "the precise meeting point of the gut - normalized hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath29 and the @xmath30 gauge coupling @xmath31 is at a scale that would be too low ( @xmath32 ) to satisfy proton decay constraints if the gut gauge boson masses were nearby .    despite all the problems with these high - scale non - supersymmetric unification scenarios , there have been clever attempts to salvage them  @xcite , and probably other clever ways that have yet to be discussed .",
    "the various attempts to save them may require intermediate thresholds , but here we do not admit all those uncertainties and instead analyze the sm evolution up to the unification scale @xmath33 where @xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) . furthermore , the additional threshold corrections and symmetries required to make non - supersymmetric guts work may have very little impact on the higgs sector . or , more likely , there would exist an intermediate scale @xmath35 , perhaps associated with the neutrino seesaw scale , such that below it one expects perturbative sm evolution .",
    "therefore , we will keep this idea within the space of possibilities when discussing higgs boson predictions , and we will make plots of higgs boson mass assuming a perturbative sm evolution below an arbitrary scale @xmath20 .",
    "the reader can then associate @xmath20 with @xmath27 , @xmath35 , or some other scale as he or she pleases .    a second idea that motivates",
    "unification at the low - energy scale is @xmath36 electroweak unification  @xcite ( for some earlier attempts , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the generic prediction of this framework is that the hypercharge and @xmath30 couplings unify at @xmath0 ( @xmath37 ) , which translates to a scale of about @xmath38 .",
    "it is relatively easy within these unification models to adjust the value of @xmath19 at the unification scale to values above @xmath39 .",
    "our goal now is to demarcate the range of higgs masses that allow for a perturbative unification theory , with a perturbative higgs self - coupling , for each value of @xmath19 .",
    "we will consider all values of @xmath19 from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the reader should not get the impression that we are advocating theories with perturbative couplings as somehow more likely than theories with non - perturbative couplings .",
    "nature s reality is probably independent of the pain it gives humans to understand it .",
    "our emphasis here is only that by analyzing the higgs sector coupling as given by its mass , we can determine if a perturbative theory is compatible with a particular unification scenario .",
    "one exception to this modest interpretative value to our work here is supersymmetric guts , where it appears desirable to keep all couplings perturbative so as not to feed into the gauge coupling renormalization group equations and spoil the extraordinary unification of all three gauge couplings of the sm at a high scale .",
    "the higgs potential for the doublet higgs field @xmath41 is [ higgs potential ] v()= -m^2_^+(^)^2 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , three of the four degrees of freedom are eaten by the weak gauge bosons , leaving one physical degree of freedom remaining with mass , m_h^2=v^2 where @xmath42 .",
    "requiring the theory remain perturbative up to some scale @xmath20 implies that the higgs self - coupling @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a non - perturbative value for the coupling constant . choosing a numerical value for @xmath44",
    "is not easily justified in this analysis .",
    "one finds many conditions advocated for @xmath45 to remain perturbative : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc .",
    "these choices , unfortunately , depend on the numerical prefactor to the @xmath50 coupling .",
    "for example , if we were to rescale @xmath51 the conditions on @xmath45 set forth above are clearly much too weak to identify the onset of the non - perturbative regime .",
    "we therefore seek a definition of the onset of non - perturbative behavior which is independent of the numerical factors out in front of operators .",
    "our methodology that satisfies this aim is to turn off all couplings except the higgs coupling and expand its @xmath52 to successively higher loop order , [ sm higgs rge ] = _ i ^(iloop ) _",
    "= ^2 + ^3+^4 + , where in the @xmath53 scheme , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we then identify the onset of non - perturbativity as when any higher loop order contribution to the beta function exceeds the value of any lower loop order contribution .",
    "that is , [ perturbative condition ] |^(j >",
    "i)_| <    violation of the condition implies non - perturbative coupling .",
    "therefore , given our definition of @xmath45 from eqs .",
    "[ higgs potential ] and [ sm higgs rge ] , @xmath45 remains perturbative as long as it is below @xmath57 .    in fig .",
    "[ mh_limit ] we plot the upper limit on the higgs mass that can be expected in a theory that remains perturbative ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) up to the scale @xmath20 ( similar sm analyses can be found in  @xcite ) . at the bottom of the figure we also plot a lower limit of the higgs mass by requiring",

    "however , even for a low scale such as @xmath1 needed for @xmath36 electroweak unification , the non - renormalizable operators are not expected to have a large impact on the higgs boson mass given our assumptions of perturbativity . for example , we can look at the simple dimension six operator , _ nr = f and estimate the mass shift of the higgs boson to be m_h^2= f^2 .",
    "since this adds in quadrature to the higgs mass , a higgs mass of @xmath83 is increased by only @xmath84 to @xmath85 if @xmath86 and @xmath1 , as would be appropriate when considering the @xmath87 case .",

    "perturbativity up to this high scale then puts a constraint on @xmath89 to be within the range @xmath97 , which in turn puts a constraint on the possible values of the lightest higgs mass in supersymmetry .",

    "superpartners could disrupt the precision electroweak predictions , but it is well known that supersymmetry decouples rapidly from @xmath115-pole observables .",
    "attempts to make the global fits to the data better by resolving some small discrepancies between leptonic and hadronic observables also demonstrate the rapid decoupling of supersymmetry , since the active superpartners in these studies must be very light ( e.g. , @xmath116 as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as soon as one goes beyond the most minimal supersymmetric theory , the constraints of perturbativity become very significant again , just as they were in our sm analysis  @xcite .",
    "the reason is because non - minimal supersymmetric theories add additional yukawa couplings that contribute directly to the mass of the lightest higgs , but are not usefully constrained by any known measurement .",
