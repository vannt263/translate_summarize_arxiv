    "the proof of such a statement is well beyond the scope of this paper .    in this paper , we focus on the heat content of a bounded , connected , open set @xmath35 with polygonal boundary .",

    "the terms which involve the area and perimeter are as expected and agree with those in .",
    "we see that the heat content has a non - trivial dependence on the interior angles of the polygonal boundary .",
    "we observe that @xmath62 is continuous on @xmath63 , decreasing on @xmath64 $ ] and symmetric with respect to @xmath65 .",

    "@xmath76 is the trace of the second fundamental form when @xmath77 is oriented with a smooth inward - pointing unit normal vector field .    the expansion for the heat content of a polygon with dirichlet @xmath3 boundary conditions was obtained in @xcite .",

    "the model computations involving the infinite wedge @xmath42 are the most difficult to carry out . however , in contrast to the case with dirichlet 0 boundary conditions , we must also consider the contribution to the heat content from a vertex which belongs to the boundaries of more than one wedge .",

    "this agrees with the fact that there are no further locally computable invariants of @xmath0 and @xmath20 available from which non - trivial quantities could be built .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed for the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace .",

    "this is due to the fact that the dirichlet @xmath3 boundary conditions guarantee the independence of the heat flow in these touching squares . in this paper",
    ", we do not impose dirichlet @xmath3 boundary conditions on @xmath113 and if the cubes touch , then this could give rise to an extra term .",
