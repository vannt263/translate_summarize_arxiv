    "one of the main topics in the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to give a detailed description of space - time evolution for the hot and dense nuclear matter by using a dynamical model such as kinetic transport models @xcite or hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data at the rhic energy suggest that we may see the significant effect of jet quenching in transverse momentum distribution for neutral pions @xcite or azimuthal asymmetry for charged hadrons @xcite .",
    "so hydrodynamic simulations of expanding hot and/or dense matter are indispensable in quantitatively estimating the effect of the medium on the jet quenching @xcite .",
    "one of the authors ( t.h . )",
    "has already built a fully three dimensional hydrodynamic model which describes not only central but also non - central collisions @xcite .",
    "in contrary to other hydrodynamic models , e.g. , ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional models with the bjorken s scaling solution @xcite or ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional models with cylindrical symmetry along the collision axis @xcite , full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional hydrodynamic models @xcite enables us to obtain the rapidity dependence of particle distribution , elliptic flow , and hbt radii in _ non - central _ collisions .",
    "statistical and hydrodynamics - motivated models give us the characteristic temperatures in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these temperatures are very useful in understanding what happens in collisions . from fitting the model calculation of particle ratios for hadrons to the experimental data , the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath1 is obtained at each collision energy @xcite . on the other hand , we can obtain the thermal ( kinetic ) freeze - out temperature @xmath2 from the slopes of transverse momentum distribution by assuming the radial flow profile @xcite .",
    "the temperatures obtained above are usually different from each other at the ags , sps , and probably rhic energies : @xmath3-@xmath4 mev while @xmath5-@xmath6 mev .",
    "the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath7 at various collision energies seem to be aligned on one line in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane .",
    "this line is sometimes called  chemical freeze - out line \" and can be parameterized by the average energy per particle @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "those analyses indicates that the system undergoes first the chemical freeze - out where the observed particle ratios are fixed and next the thermal freeze - out where the shape of the transverse momentum distribution is fixed @xcite . since the time scale of the hydrodynamic evolution is comparable with ( or smaller than ) that of the inelastic collisions between hadrons , the number changing processes are likely to be out of equilibrium .",
    "this is the reason why there are two sequential freeze - out processes in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . to give a more realistic description of the temporal and spatial behavior of the hot and dense matter",
    ", the above pictures should be included in the model .",
    "this makes us approach the comprehensive understanding of the deconfined matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .    in this paper",
    ", we incorporate the different freeze - out temperatures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , into hydrodynamics and discuss how the early chemical freeze - out affects the space - time evolution of fluids and the particle spectra @xcite . in the ordinary hydrodynamic calculations",
    ", one assumes both chemical and thermal equilibrium and consequently @xmath11 which is to be determined from comparison of the slopes of transverse spectrum with the experimental data .",
    "if the system obeys the above picture of early chemical freeze - out , those ordinary hydrodynamic models can hardly reproduce the particle ratios due to the smallness of the chemical freeze - out temperature . as a result",
    ", the number of resonance particles at the thermal freeze - out becomes too small .",
    "the physics at the low transverse momentum is largely affected by resonance decays after thermal freeze - out .",
    "for example , the low @xmath0 enhancement in the transverse momentum spectrum for pions can be explained by the contribution from resonance decays @xcite .",
    "the slope of the @xmath0 spectrum for pions directly emitted from the freeze - out hypersurface is almost constant . on the other hand , data for pions at low @xmath0",
    "shows a steeper slope than those in medium @xmath0 region ( @xmath12 1 gev/@xmath13 ) .",
    "so one can not reproduce the low @xmath0 enhancement only from direct pions .",
    "pions from @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 decays show steeper @xmath0 spectrum than direct pions .",
    "we naturally explain the low @xmath0 enhancement seen in the experimental data by resonance decays .",
    "another example is the reduction of the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution for pions at low @xmath0 @xcite . from the exact treatment of the decay kinematics , pions from resonance decays",
    "can pretend _ out - of - plane _ elliptic flow even when the hydrodynamic flow shows _ in - plane _ elliptic flow .",
    "this dilutes elliptic flow from direct pions .",
    "therefore the early chemical freeze - out must be included in hydrodynamics in order to analyze not only the particle ratios but also the single particle spectra and the azimuthal asymmetry .",

    "we assume the following picture of space - time evolution for hot and/or dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "first , the huge number of secondary partons are produced and both chemical and thermal equilibrium among these partons are achieved in the early stage of collisions . the initial dominant longitudinal flow and the large pressure gradient perpendicular to the collision axis cause the system to expand and cool down . when the temperature of the system reaches the critical temperature @xmath17 , the hadronization starts to occur .",
    "just after the hadronization finishes , the chemical freeze - out happens at @xmath18 .",
    "below @xmath1 , the ratios of the number of observed particle are fixed . even after chemical freeze - out",
    ", the system keeps thermal equilibrium through elastic scattering .",
    "finally , all hadrons are thermally frozen at @xmath19(@xmath20 ) .",
    "if we neglect dissipation in the space - time evolution of nuclear matter , we can apply the hydrodynamic equations for the perfect fluid , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are energy momentum tensor and baryon density current , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are energy density , pressure , baryon density , and four fluid velocity . with the help of thermodynamical identities and the baryon density conservation , the first equation is rewritten in @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the entropy current .",
    "these equations mean that a fluid element evolves along an adiabatic path ( @xmath31 = const . ) in the @xmath8-@xmath32 plane .",
    "we assume this fact is approximately valid even below chemical freeze - out line .",
    "when @xmath33 stable hadrons in the equation of state ( eos ) undergo chemical freeze - out across the chemical freeze - out line , we can introduce chemical potentials @xmath34 associated with those hadrons .",
    "then we may construct the eos in the ( @xmath35 ) dimensional space ( @xmath33 for @xmath34 and 2 for @xmath8 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "this causes a serious problem when we numerically simulate a hydrodynamic model with finite resources of memory .",
    "since the chemical potential of each hadron depends on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath8 , and @xmath32 during expansion along an adiabatic path , we can restrict ourselves to the eos in a two dimensional hypersurface @xmath39 embedded in the @xmath40 dimensional space .",
    "thus we need not prepare such a large dimensional table of the eos anymore .",
    "when we obtain @xmath34 at a point ( @xmath8 , @xmath32 ) below the chemical freeze - out line , we need the information at the chemical freeze - out point @xmath41 somewhere on the chemical freeze - out line and have to go back to the point along an adiabatic path .",
    "since the adiabatic path itself is obtained from the thermodynamical variables and @xmath42 , we have to solve the problem self - consistently . in this paper",
    ", we restrict our discussion to the zero baryonic chemical potential where the adiabatic path becomes a trivial one , @xmath43 .",

    "the eos for the qgp phase is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a bag constant specified later . for the hadron phase , we choose three different models eos as follows .",
    "the first model is an ordinary resonance gas model in which complete chemical equilibrium is always assumed ( model ce ) .",

    ", we obtain the bag constant @xmath53 = 247.2 mev and the latent heat @xmath541.7 gev/@xmath55 .",
    "the second model is the simplest one which describes the picture of chemical freeze - out ( model cfo ) .",
    "below @xmath1 , we assume the numbers of _ all _ hadrons @xmath56 included in the eos are fixed and that the particle number densities obey @xmath57 .",
    "we introduce a chemical potential @xmath58 associated with each species so that @xmath56 becomes a conserved quantity . from the conservation of entropy @xmath29",
    ", the ratio of the particle number density to the entropy density below the chemical freeze - out temperature obeys @xmath59 for all hadrons along the adiabatic path .",
    "here we assume @xmath60 mev , which is consistent with a recent analysis based on a thermal model at the rhic energy @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio1 ] ) , we obtain a chemical potential as a function of temperature for each hadron .",
    "the @xmath58 ensures to keep the ratios of the number of each hadron throughout the space - time evolution of a fluid element without explicitely solving @xmath57 .",
    "all chemical potentials are functions of temperature , so the thermodynamical variables depend only on temperature even after chemical freeze - out .",
    "the third model represents a more realistic eos than the second one .",
    "the following model is first discussed in ref .",
    "the observed particle numbers are always composed of the contribution from direct particles and resonance decays , i.e. , @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 is an effective degree of freedom which is a product of the degeneracy @xmath63 and the branching ratio @xmath49 .",
    "so some elastic processes with large cross sections ( e.g. , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) can be equilibrated even below @xmath1 @xcite as long as the equality @xmath67 is kept instead of eq .",
