    "the basic principle of spintronics is to utilize spin current@xcite to transport information .",
    "various mechanisms such as spin field effect transistor ( spin - fet)@xcite , spin - transfer torque@xcite , spin pumping@xcite , and ( inverse ) spin hall effect@xcite have been proposed to generate , control , and detect the spin current , which made designing practical devices a reality .",
    "the spin current generated by these means is dissipative , i.e. , a certain way of energy delivery is necessary to maintain the spin current . on the other hand , mechanisms for dissipationless spin transport have been proposed .",
    "for instance , a dissipationless spin current can be generated by an external electric field via intrinsic spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "another intensively studied example are the helical edge states in quantum spin hall systems@xcite and topological superconductors@xcite , which consist of dissipationless counterpropagate of opposite spins .",
    "another category of dissipationless spin transport is the spin josephson effect proposed for various junctions@xcite and measured in @xmath0he-@xmath1 through narrow apertures@xcite .",
    "the general feature is that by coupling two systems that have @xmath2-breaking order parameters , a spontaneous spin current @xmath3 flows across the junction , where @xmath4 is the angular difference of the two order parameters .",
    "a natural consequence of this spin supercurrent in junctions made of magnetic metals , in combination with the continuity equation , is the precession of the magnetization due to the fact that a spin supercurrent transfers angular momentum@xcite .",
    "this precession , which will be called `` josephson precession '' throughout this article , serves as a new mechanism for the magnetic order parameters to spontaneously precess .    in this article",
    ", we demonstrate that a dissipationless spin current flows between two coupled ferromagnets when their magnetic order parameters are misaligned , regardless the two ferromagnets are metallic or insulating .",
    "we show that , as long as the coupling between the two ferromagnets has the generic form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic order parameter and @xmath7 is the effective coupling , a dissipationless spin current occurs when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are misaligned . on a phenomenological level ,",
    "the dissipationless spin current @xmath10 can be derived from the commutation relation@xcite @xmath11=-\\left[\\theta , s_{r}^{y}\\right]=i$ ] , where @xmath12 is the bound state energy stored in the system .",
    "this current - bound state relation is completely analogous to that in the josephson effect , from which it is also concluded that this spin current is independent from scattering . on the microscopic level , the precise mechanism for",
    "the dissipationless spin current depends on the metallic or insulating nature of the two systems and their interface , which also determines if the dissipationless spin current is a equilibrium persistent current or a supercurrent carried by a certain condensate@xcite .",
    "these microscopic mechanisms will be elaborated in details . besides two coupled bulk systems",
    ", this misalignment principle also applies to a bulk magnetic insulator , and accounts for the spin supercurrent described by the vector chirality @xmath13@xcite .    the central issue in experimentally realizing the dissipationless spin current is , of course , how to create the misaligned configuration between @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", especially the misalignment means that they are not in the energetically most favorable configuration ( which would be parallel or antiparallel , depends on the sign of @xmath7 ) .",
    "this motivates us to study the effect of magnetic ( @xmath14 ) field .",
    "we show that a uniform , static @xmath14 field is an efficient handle to create the misalignment between magnetic order parameters . in systems where the effective coupling is antiferromagnetic ( af ) , @xmath15 , larmor precession and josephson precession are in opposite directions , hence the misalignment and the dissipationless spin",
    "current can be created by a @xmath14 field in equilibrium , such as in a canted af insulator .",
    "in addition , if the magnetization of a magnet is strongly pinned by shape anisotropy , one can coupled it to a misaligned magnetization by attaching it to a normal metal , and then use @xmath14 field to magnetize the normal metal .",
    "an additional advantage of @xmath14 field is that , a strong enough @xmath14 field can fix the direction of magnetization against josephson precession , hence stabilize the polarization of the dissipationless spin current .",
    "moreover , applying @xmath14 field in magnetic insulators with noncollinear order changes the vector chirality@xcite , and yields a spin supercurrent that can flow out of the system .",
    "we give concrete examples for above mechanisms and estimate the realistic values of dissipationless spin current , together with experimental proposals to indirectly measure the dissipationless spin current .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",

    "within this description , the magnetization @xmath39 is treated as a macroscopic condensate .",
