    "as is clearly evident , the photon production rate from our new channel decreases with increasing chemical potential with fixed energy density , showing a similar dependence to the qcd annihilation and compton processes .",
    "it would appear that with energy density fixed , the photon production from our new channel has a much stronger dependence on the temperature than on the chemical potential and has not exceeded the photon production rate from qcd annihilation and compton processes in the range of energies explored . it should be recalled that the above statement is true of only the hard photon production rate and may not hold in an extension to soft photons where cut - cut contributions will contribute .",

    "we have presented the hard photon signature of the gluon sector . while the gluonic sector may not itself consist of quasi - particle gluons , the production of hard photons through the gluon fusion channel outlined in this paper , similar to the production of large mass drell - yan pairs , will be sensitive to the gluon structure functions of such matter .",

    "phenomenological estimates of the photon production rate from such equilibrium channels have tended to be suppressed compared to the leading order rates for realistic values of temperature and chemical potential .",
