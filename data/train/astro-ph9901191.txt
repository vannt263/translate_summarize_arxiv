    "mapping the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is one of the major goals of observational cosmology .",
    "traditionally this is performed using large surveys of galaxies .",
    "such surveys map the light distribution , while most of the matter in the universe appears to be dark .",
    "this paper focuses on mapping the dark matter using gravitational lensing , in particular , weak lensing of distant background galaxies by large - scale structure .",
    "weak lensing magnifies and shears the images of these galaxies , inducing an additional ellipticity which , although not detectable in any individual image , can be measured as a function of position on the sky by averaging the ellipticities of neighboring galaxies .",
    "this observable is determined by a line - of - sight projection of the mass fluctuations and by the spatial geometry of the universe . when averaged over windows of arcminute scale , the ellipticities of distant galaxies",
    "probe mass fluctuations on scales of 1 - 10 @xmath4 mpc .",
    "if the shape of the mass fluctuation spectrum is known , such measures are sensitive to the cosmological parameters @xmath1 and @xmath5 . thus while strong lensing leads to highly distorted or multiple images and probes the densest regions of the universe , the inner cores of massive halos , weak lensing provides a direct measure of typical mass fluctuations on larger scales .",
    "observatonal attempts at detection of weak lensing by large - scale structure include the work of fahlman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , mould et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , refregier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and schneider et al .",
    "while a definitive detection has yet to be made , a few groups have demonstrated the capability to measure the small shear signal induced by large - scale structure .",
    "kaiser et al . (",
    "1998 ) have made a convincing detection of coherent shear due to a supercluster .",
    "several observational efforts to measure weak lensing that use wide field ccd detectors are currently underway ( see mellier 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the first weak lensing calculations to use modern models for the large - scale matter distribution were those of @xcite and @xcite , based on the pioneering work of gunn ( 1967 ) .",
    "more recently , villumsen ( 1996 ) , stebbins ( 1996 ) , bernardeau et al ( 1997 ) and kaiser ( 1998 ) have made linear calculations for a variety of cosmologies , while jain & seljak ( 1997 ) have included the effect of the nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectrum .",
    "numerical simulations of gravitational lensing have also been developed in parallel .",
    "different approximations have been used to represent the lumpy distribution of dark matter , typically in conjunction with methods which trace rays through a series of lens planes ( schneider & weiss 1988 ; jaroszyski et al 1990 ; lee & paczyski 1990 ; jaroszyski 1991 ; babul & lee 1991 ; bartelmann & schneider 1991 ; blandford et al .",
    "the most detailed numerical study of lensing by large - scale structure has been conducted by wambsganss , cen & ostriker ( 1998 ) , building on the earlier work of wambsganss et al ( 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "their work focused on somewhat smaller scales than we consider in this paper , and as a result was unable to address some of the nonlinear mode - coupling effects we are concerned with here .",
    "nevertheless , there is still considerable overlap with the regime we study .",
    "other recent studies using ray tracing have been conducted by premadi , martel & matzner ( 1998 ) , van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier ( 1998 ) , bartelmann et al ( 1998 ) and couchman , barber & thomas ( 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we apply a newly developed numerical method to investigate a variety of statistics that can be extracted from weak lensing data .",
    "our numerical approach is similar to that of some of the above references , in that we approximate the matter distribution between observer and source as a sequence of discrete planes ( see also bartelmann & schneider 1991 )",
    ". the projected distribution on these planes is obtained from high resolution n - body simulations and is converted to deflection angle and shear matrix distributions using fourier techniques .",
    "these can then be used to follow @xmath6 rays from the observer back to the source plane , giving the magnification , shear and true source position in each observed direction .",
    "the magnification and shear maps are smoothed on different scales and used to construct one - point probability distribution functions and their low - order moments .",
    "the two - point correlation function provides another simple and robust statistic and , for models with gaussian initial conditions , it contains all the fluctuation information on linear scales .",
    "we show that to reach the linear regime one must survey regions at least 10 degrees on a side .",
    "this is difficult with existing ccd cameras which typically have field diameters of @xmath7 .",
    "most of the information in the initial surveys carried out with these instruments will therefore be in the mildly to strongly nonlinear regime ; in the following we discuss methods for power spectrum extraction from such data .",
    "while nonlinear evolution may limit the information that can be extracted from a power spectrum analysis , it also leads to non - gaussian effects that can be detected by statistics other than second moments .",
    "these effects can provide qualitatively new information because the boundary of the linear regime depends on the relative density fluctuation , @xmath8 , while the amplitude of the weak lensing signal is determined by a projection of the total mass fluctuation , @xmath9 .",
    "studies of two - point correlators can not separate the effect of @xmath10 from a variation in the normalization of @xmath11 , but the transition to nonlinearity depends on the density contrast alone , so that the behavior of higher moments allows a separate determination of the density parameter @xmath12 and the matter power spectrum @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .    in this respect",
    "weak lensing maps are easier to interpret than maps of the galaxy distribution , where non - gaussian signatures reflect both nonlinear gravitational clustering and the details of the relation between the galaxy distribution and the underlying mass distribution .",
    "checks of the consistency of any assumed `` bias '' relation are certainly valuable , but they do not provide qualitatively new information on cosmological parameters ; that is why dynamical measures such as streaming motion or velocity dispersion estimates are needed for galaxy surveys to provide a robust probe of @xmath1 .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure [ figdeltapdf ] , which compares the one point distribution functions ( pdf ) of the convergence @xmath14 and the density contrast @xmath11 for open and einstein - de sitter universes both with cdm power spectrum shape parameter @xmath15 .",
    "( these were made from the ray - tracing simulations discussed in  3 . )",
    "the pdf s of @xmath14 differ substantially even when their rms values are the same . for @xmath11 , on the other hand , the rms completely determines the pdf , leaving no leverage to determine @xmath1 .",
    "[ figdeltapdf ]    in this paper we investigate the observability of nonlinear effects in weak lensing data .",
    "we apply statistics which measure a variety of non - gaussian signatures to simulated data .",
    "these are obtained by ray - tracing through @xmath16-body simulations , and sampling the resulting shear fields with realistic number densities of source galaxies .",
    "our main goal is to see how accurately the density parameter can be estimated , given the uncertainty in other parameters , such as the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "the main statistic we investigate is the one - point pdf of the convergence or projected matter density .",
    "it can be analyzed in many different ways , for example by using direct maximum likelihood ( ml ) parameter estimation , by measuring various moments , or by constructing an edgeworth expansion . in principle",
    "ml should give the most powerful constraints , but it is somewhat cumbersome to use and it requires a suite of cosmological simulations spanning the parameter space considered .",
    "the latter two methods are simpler and can be tested against perturbation theory , but they use the information in a less optimal way . in the following ,",
    "we evaluate the performance of these estimators and compare their robustness , statistical power and simplicity .",
    "our results on the second moment are valid for both the convergence and shear , as their second moments are identical in the weak lensing approximation and for the range of scales of interest for lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "for the skewness and the pdf , we present results for the convergence , which is not a direct observable . we demonstrate that for fields larger than a degree on a side it is possible to reconstruct the convergence from data on the ellipticities of galaxies by using the fourier space relations between convergence and shear ( equation [ kappaft ] ) . in our modeling of observational data we have included the random errors in shear measurement due to the finite number of source galaxies ,",
    "each of which has a large intrinsic ellipticity .",
    "however we have not considered realistic observational noise , such as due to seeing and possibly anisotropic point spread functions ",
    "thus we are assuming ideal imaging data in this paper .",
    "these sources of observational noise can degrade the signal and produce systematic errors that must be carefully modeled to extract the shear signal .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 the formalism for the weak lensing calculation is presented .",
    "our n - body simulations and our ray - tracing method are described in  3 , where the effective resolution of our results is estimated and is tested by varying the relevant numerical parameters . ",
    "4 gives predictions for the power spectrum and the real space 2-point correlation of the convergence for various cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "the scatter due to noise ( primarily from the finite number and intrinsic ellipticity of the background galaxies ) and to the finite survey area is estimated . ",
    "5 contains a discussion of various measures of non - gaussianity .",
    "results for the probability distribution function and its moments are presented in  6 , where we also discuss the survey size needed for an accurate measurement of @xmath1 given realistic number densities of source galaxies . a likelihood and @xmath17 analysis of the pdf",
    "is made in  7 , which also further explores robust estimators of @xmath1 based on the pdf .",

    "gravitational lensing shears and magnifies the images of distant galaxies . in this section",
    "we relate the shear and magnification to perturbations in the gravitational potential along the line of sight .",
    "we first analyze the continuous case , then present a discrete approximation to it . in the discrete case the matter distribution between the source and observer is taken to lie on a finite number @xmath16 of lens planes .",
    "the mapping from the image plane ( the first lens plane ) to the source plane is then determined by adding the deflections over all the @xmath16 lens planes ( e.g. schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) .",

    "the density parameter @xmath23 can have contributions from @xmath1 or @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the advantage of using the conformal time @xmath19 is that the metric becomes conformally euclidean ( @xmath33 ) , 3-sphere ( @xmath34 ) or 3-hyperboloid ( @xmath35 ) , leading to a simple geometrical description of light propagation .",

    "the perturbations @xmath97 can be computed from the jacobian matrix @xmath86 using the fourier space relations @xmath98 where we have dropped the index @xmath85 for clarity .",
    "one could also express the above relations in terms of off - diagonal elements of @xmath70 .      to obtain the ellipticity induced by gravitational lensing we consider the action of the distortion matrix @xmath70 on a circular image .",
    "a general matrix can be decomposed into a symmetric and a rotational matrix ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) @xmath99 in the symmetric case @xmath100 and the image of a circular source is stretched into an ellipse , with the stretch factors of the two axes given by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "the direction of major axis of the ellipse is @xmath103 .",
    "the magnification of the image is given by @xmath104 .",
    "if the distortion matrix @xmath70 is not symmetric there is also an overall rotation of the image by angle @xmath38 . assuming this term is small we can expand the rotation matrix to obtain @xmath105 image rotation by @xmath38",
    "leaves the magnification unchanged to lowest order , but modifies the two shear components : @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "in general , the lowest order contributions to the rotation angle @xmath38 are quadratic in shear and are significantly smaller than the first order contributions to @xmath14 and @xmath108 .",
    "the only situation in which rotation can be important is if two critical images that are well separated in redshift are superimposed ; this is rather unlikely in our universe .",
    "we verify this below by measuring the rotational component of @xmath70 in our simulations ",
    "it is shown in figure [ figantisym ] and discussed in section 4 .    for individual galaxy images",
    "the gravitational stretching can not be separated from the intrinsic ellipticity . however , by averaging the ellipticity of all images seen near a given direction , a smoothed version of the gravitational component can be measured . to compute the distortion in this case we need to average the distortion matrices over the smoothing window and over the redshift distribution of the sources .",
    "let us assume we know the probability @xmath109 that a given galaxy lies on the @xmath85-th plane , where @xmath110 .",
    "the average distortion before angular smoothing is then @xmath111 ray - tracing must therefore be performed up to the most distant plane where @xmath109 is not negligible .",
    "the previous section contains the formulae for multiple plane lensing that we use in our ray tracing simulations .",
    "the key relations are equations ( [ thetaper ] ) for the position of a given photon @xmath112 and equations ( [ amult]-[gammaft ] ) for the jacobian matrix @xmath78 at this position . aside from the distance factor @xmath113 ,",
    "the main inputs into the recursion relations for @xmath112 and @xmath78 are the shear matrices @xmath80 and previous @xmath86 s , all of which need to be stored .",
    "the ray tracing algorithm consists of three parts : constructing the dark matter lens planes , computing the shear matrix on each plane , and using these to evolve the photon trajectory from the observer to the source .",
    "the details involved at each step are as follows .",
    "the dark matter distribution between the source and observer is projected onto @xmath114 equally spaced lens planes , depending on the size of simulation box and the redshift of the sources .",
    "the particle dump closest in redshift to each plane is used for this projection .",
    "the projected field is a square of predetermined angular size  usually the angular size of the simulation box at the source distance .",
    "the orientation of the projection as well as the location of the origin are chosen at random .",
    "this minimizes repetition of structures from the simulation at the same projected position .",
    "the particle positions on each plane are interpolated onto a grid of size @xmath115 for the p@xmath116 m runs , and smaller sizes for the pm runs ( the p@xmath116 m and pm simulations are described in the next sub - section ) . the dimensionless density @xmath91 used in the lensing equations",
    "is given by the projected particle density times a redshift - dependent constant ( see equation [ sigma ] ) .",
    "\\2 . on each plane @xmath92 is computed on a grid .",
    "this is done by fourier transforming the projected density @xmath91 and using equations ( [ gammaft ] ) to obtain the shear .",
    "the inverse fourier transform is then used to return to real space , and the shear matrix @xmath92 is given by linear combinations of @xmath91 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 obtained from equations ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ umatrix ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed when carrying out these operations , hence we use zero - padding to minimize the spurious effects introduced .",
    "since the final convergence effectively depends only on a projection of the density along the photon path ( equation [ kproj ] ) and the relative location of different planes is in any case random transverse to the line of sight , this mistreatment of the effects of the matter outside our grid has very little influence on our results .",
    "the photons are started on a regular grid on the first lens plane .",
    "perturbations along the line of sight distort this grid and are computed using equation ( [ thetaper ] ) .",
    "once we have the photon positions , we interpolate the shear matrix @xmath92 onto them and solve equation [ amult ] for the jacobian matrix @xmath78 of the mapping from the @xmath76-th lens plane to the first plane , using previously stored @xmath86 and @xmath80 .",
    "\\4 . solving the recursion relations up to the source plane",
    "yields the jacobian matrix @xmath78 at these positions .",
    "finally , we may sum over the redshift distribution of sources using equation [ weight ] .",
    "note that the ray tracing is done backwards from the observer to the source , thus ensuring that all the photons reach the observer .",
    "the first lens plane is the image plane and has the unperturbed photon positions .",
    "the use of fft s for computing @xmath119 and @xmath92 simplifies and speeds up the numerical implementation .",
    "because the cpu required for an @xmath120 fft scales as @xmath121 , it is possible to use sufficiently large grids to maintain the intrinsic resolution of the n - body simulation ( see below ) .",
    "a direct summation would be prohibitively time consuming .",
    "an alternative poisson - solver of similar resolution would be a tree - code as used by wambsganss et al ( 1995 ) and wambsganss , cen & ostriker ( 1998 ) .",
    "we found that a substantial fraction of the overall time in a ray - tracing run was taken up by reading in the @xmath122 grids .",
    "the 2-dimensional fft s needed for computing @xmath123 and @xmath92 take the bulk of the cpu time .",
    "cpu constraints turn out , however , to be negligible : a run using grids of size @xmath124 can be completed in 20 - 30 minutes on a dec - alpha workstation provided it has enough memory .",
    "memory is a problem with such large grids because the recursion relations require the storage of the @xmath78 matrices at all the lens planes .",
    "this could be avoided if one used the recursion relation based on previous two planes only ( seitz , schneider & ehlers 1994 ) , although for simplicity we have not implemented that .",
    "thus for the 4-component matrix of real*4 numbers for the @xmath78 s , computed on @xmath124 photon positions on 20 lens planes , one needs @xmath125 bytes , or about 320 megabytes of memory .",
    "a @xmath115 grid with a spatial resolution twice as good would require 4 times the memory , i.e. more than 1.2 gigabytes  this is the grid size used for our high resolution runs .",

    "most of our results are based on a set of high resolution , adaptive particle - particle / particle - mesh ( ap@xmath116 m ) simulations , but we also use a set of particle - mesh ( pm ) simulations to explore issues related to numerical resolution .",
    "pm simulations solve poisson s equation on a grid in order to advance the particle distribution .",
    "the grid spacing is the key factor limiting the numerical resolution ; we use grids of sizes between @xmath126 and @xmath127 with a particle number typically equal to one eighth the number of grid sites .",
    "ap@xmath116 m simulations supplement a grid calculation of the long - range component of the gravitational force with a short range correction computed either by a direct sum over neighboring particles , or , in highly clustered regions , by combining a calculation on a localized refinement mesh with a direct sum over a smaller number of much closer neighbors .",
    "these techniques ensure that the force law is effectively newtonian down to much smaller separations than can be achieved with a pm code .",
    "our high - resolution simulations used a parallel adaptive ap@xmath116 m code ( couchman , thomas & pearce 1995 ; pearce & couchman 1997 ) kindly made available by the virgo supercomputing consortium ( e.g. jenkins et al 1998 ) .",

    "we limit the analysis here to second order statistics although it is straightforwardly generalized to higher order moments . from equation ( [ kproj ] ) it is easy to show that poisson sampling introduces an additional variance in the convergence along each line of sight given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the mass of a particle in the n - body simulation , @xmath146 is the effective solid angle over which averaging is carried out to evaluate @xmath14 and @xmath147 is the comoving volume per steradian out to distance @xmath42 .",

    ".      [ figcorrected ]    the error bars shown in figure [ figpower ] indicate the dispersion in the measured power for fields of size @xmath185 on a side . on these scales the largest modes are linear and the fluctuations on large scales are due to sample variance , i.e. the small number of modes available to measure the power . for smaller fields even the largest modes are nonlinear and become coupled to the modes on smaller scales . in this case",
    "the power spectrum variation is no longer dominated by the finite number of modes , rather it is determined by the strength of mode coupling which depends on the power on scales of the survey .",
    "the error bars in the upper left panel of figure [ figcorrected ] can be compared with those in figure [ figpower ] to see the effect of reducing the field size .",
    "[ fignoise ]    [ figrms ]    in figure [ figcorrected ] we explore a way of reducing the scatter in the measured power on a set of fields of @xmath186 on a side .",
    "the main source of scatter with small field sizes arises from the fact that in a given redshift bin , the mass density deflecting the light rays is not equal to the global mean at that redshift .",
    "the effect of the departure from the global mean density can be approximated by changing the growth factor for the density perturbations within that region , i.e. using the growth factor for a different value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is another way of describing the dominant effect of nonlinear mode coupling .",
    "the mean @xmath14 measured on the source plane is a weighted integral of the density over redshift .",
    "it therefore provides a measure of the change in the density growth factor averaged over redshift with a known window function .",
    "we could use the value of the measured mean @xmath14 in that region ( which could be obtained , for example , from a larger sample , or from the number counts ) to `` correct '' the measured power spectrum of @xmath14 for the fluctuations in the mean density along the line of sight . to implement this procedure with observational data",
    "would require assuming a value of @xmath1 ; one could repeat the procedure with varying @xmath1 until the error bars are minimized . in principle",
    "this offers a method of measuring @xmath1 from the fluctuations in the mean @xmath14 in different fields , but is likely to give a poorer constraint than using higher moments of the distribution . nevertheless , the fact that for the correct value of @xmath1 the fluctuations are reduced by nearly a factor of 2 implies that the main source of error in the power spectrum are the fluctuations on scales larger than the beam , which in this case are of order unity .",
    "this source of error dominates the effect of finite number of modes , especially on scales much smaller than the field size for which there are many modes per wavenumber bin .",
    "so far we have discussed the effects of sample variance that would be present even if the data had no noise and the galaxies were intrinsically circular .",
    "the dominant source of noise in observational data are the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies .",
    "figure [ fignoise ] shows the power spectrum measured from simulated data with @xmath187 galaxies per square degree whose intrinsic ellipticities are gaussian distributed with an rms of 0.4 for each component .",
    "clearly at high @xmath71 the ellipticity noise dominates and prevents the determination of the true power spectrum for @xmath188 . for @xmath189 ,",
    "the power spectrum can be measured with an accuracy of a few tens of percent from of order 10 fields , each a degree on a side .",
    "this wavenumber range corresponds to length scales of @xmath190mpc at redshifts of 0.3 - 0.5 that dominate the lensing contribution .",
    "thus the mass power spectrum can be estimated most accurately over this range of scales . to reach length scales approaching @xmath191mpc sparse sampling with sufficient number of degree sized fields is required ( kaiser 1998 ) .",
    "we emphasise that these conclusions have not taken into account observational noise such as seeing that may degrade the signal , as discussed in section 1 . we have compared our estimates of the sample size with the linear estimates of blandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , kaiser ( 1992 , 1998 ) , jain & seljak ( 1997 ) and hu & tegmark ( 1999 ) .",
    "we find that the error bars of figure [ fignoise ] fluctuate about the linear estimates for @xmath192 , while they are dominated by shot noise for higher @xmath71 .",
    "the estimation of cosmic variance bears further examination with simulations that do not need to use the same box multiple times , as this may be affected by corrrelated structures .",
    "for some data sets it may only be feasible to measure moments in real space rather than fourier space .",
    "the rms of @xmath108 and @xmath14 , smoothed with a top - hat window in real space , is shown in figure [ figrms ] .",
    "the two rms values on different smoothing angles agree very well as expected analytically .",
    "the values also agree well with the nonlinear analytical predictions .",
    "the slight discrepancies at small scales are consistent with the discrepancies in the power spectra for the same models . on large scales",
    "the rms falls below the analytical values due to the missing power from long wave modes . the difference is larger than for the power spectrum because the rms at a given angle involves an integral over all wavenumbers .",
    "the fluctuations between different realizations are much smaller for the rms than for the power spectrum , again because it is an integral over a broad range of wavenumbers .",
    "given a patch of the sky with measured ellipticities of background galaxies we would like to extract cosmological information with as little loss as possible .",
    "for a gaussian distribution ( likely to be valid on large scales for popular models of structure formation ) one only needs to extract the power spectrum from the data , which completely determines all the statistical properties of weak lensing .",
    "there is a well defined procedure for doing this ( @xcite ) , based on a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method : one writes the full probability distribution ( likelihood function ) for the measurements as a multivariate gaussian , whose unknown parameters are the power spectrum coefficients as a function of scale . by finding the maximum of the likelihood function we find the estimated values of the power spectrum coefficients .",
    "the method is asymptotically unbiased and minimum variance .",
    "one can also derive a quadratic estimator from this ml method , which is easier to compute and leads to the same ml solution ( @xcite ) . for scales small",
    "compared to the survey size the quadratic estimator reduces to a simple fourier method ( kaiser 1998 ) : the fourier transform coefficients of the reconstructed @xmath14 are squared and added together for all the modes contributing to a given power spectrum bin .",
    "the power spectrum estimates are finally obtained by subtracting the noise contribution .    for non - gaussian distributions , which arise due to nonlinear gravitational evolution on small scales ,",
    "the problem of how to optimally extract the information in the data is more difficult to solve .",
    "nonlinear evolution develops correlations between fourier modes which were uncorrelated in the linear regime .",
    "this mode - mode coupling does not show up in the two point correlator of fourier modes because of translational invariance , but is present in all the higher moments .",
    "the full likelihood function would have to describe all these correlations and is therefore not amenable to analytic expressions .",
    "given that the full likelihood function is not achievable , what is the next best thing to do ? in previous studies on nonlinear clustering various statistical descriptions of non - gaussianity have been developed . among these are moments , n - point correlation functions , the bispectrum , edgeworth expansion of the pdf etc . in light of the many possible statistics one can devise , it is difficult to take a rigorous , systematic approach .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the non - gaussian signatures have been produced by gravity allows one to make some general statements regarding the merits of different estimators .",
    "we should emphasize that we are interested in the best possible statistic to determine @xmath1 , the principal free parameter in addition to the power spectrum that weak lensing can probe . in some applications of non - gaussianity , such as in galaxy clustering ,",
    "one is interested both in the biasing relation and @xmath1 .",
    "to break the degeneracy between the two the data have to be compressed in more than a single number ( e.g. bispectrum , cumulant correlators or three - point correlation function ; scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 , szapudi 1998 ) .",
    "these complications are not present in the case of weak lensing , so we can concentrate on the simplest statistics and compress all the information on @xmath1 into a single number .",
    "the first question is whether one should look for non - gaussian signatures in fourier space or in real space .",
    "we may for example compare the third moment in real space @xmath193 ( or skewness @xmath194 , where the insertion of the extra powers of second moment makes @xmath195 independent of power spectrum amplitude in perturbation theory ) to the bispectrum , defined in fourier space as @xmath196 with @xmath197 .",
    "we found the bispectrum to be a very noisy statistic , so that even with a large number of realizations the signal remained very weak .",
    "in contrast , the skewness shows a clear signature of nonlinear evolution and can be measured robustly , as shown in the next section .",
    "this is not surprising , since the bispectrum has one more parameter ( the shape of the triangle of fourier modes ) and one has to compress the data from different triangle shapes first to obtain more robust information .",
    "the question of how to combine this information is however not trivial .",
    "the skewness in real space is one way to compress this information into a single number at a given scale , and while it may not be optimal it has the advantage of being physical and easy to compute .",
    "note that to observe it we need to reconstruct convergence from the shear , which is only feasible with sufficiently large fields .",
    "as we show below large fields are required anyways for the signal to be observable , so this is less of a constraint than it would appear at first .",
    "all the results we show are based on convergence as reconstructed from shear and include any additional systematic effects that could in principle arise from this procedure .",
    "one example of such effects is forcing periodic boundary conditions to the data .",
    "this generates unphysical structure on the edges of the field , but the effects are very small and do not show up as a significant effect in any of the statistical tests we applied .",
    "the other reason for using real space methods is that the action of gravity is quite localized in real space : it approximately preserves the relative rankings of density peaks , but enhances their contrast in the distribution because of nonlinear evolution .",
    "this is the reasoning behind the gaussianization procedure ( @xcite ) , which attempts to reconstruct the primordial density field by mapping the density pdf into a gaussian .",
    "should this mapping work perfectly , we would have the full distribution function for the data , which would be written as a multivariate gaussian on a nonlinear transformation of the density field ( exactly the transformation that brings the pdf into a gaussian form ) .",
    "as discussed below , we found that this mapping does not work sufficiently well in practice to reconstruct the linear distribution .",
    "before we proceed , we need to address the issue of how to combine information obtained from different scales . for gaussian",
    "theories information from different scales can be combined for higher statistical significance of the result .",
    "this can be done because in the linear regime modes are independent , allowing information from different scales to be combined .",
    "once the second moments ( or power spectrum ) are determined there is only one additional parameter that we aim to determine from weak lensing data , the density parameter @xmath1 ( ignoring the differences between open and cosmological constant models with the same @xmath1 ) .",
    "this parameter can be determined from a range of scales .",
    "the information from different scales however can not be combined independently . if nonlinear evolution were to only enhance the contrast , but not change the initial ranking order of density values ( as assumed in gaussianization ) , then one could argue that the smallest scale includes all of the information present in the largest scales as well .",
    "we have tested this by mapping the pdf into a gaussian on a small scale ( gaussianize the data ) and then constructing the pdf on a larger smoothing scale .",
    "we found that the pdf on the larger scale was very close to a gaussian , so that most of the information on the non - gaussianity of the pdf was used up by the mapping on the smaller scale .",
    "however , there are still mode - mode correlations present in the transformed data , so gaussianization as a way to obtain their full likelihood function does not work sufficiently well .",
    "these correlations are not accessible by using the pdf in real space ; it would require a much more complicated method to add this information to the one from pdf .",
    "in the absence of noise , the smallest scales are the most sensitive to nonlinear effects .",
    "noise masks information more on small scales , so there exists an optimal scale where noise is still not dominant and non - gaussian effects are large enough to look for the non - gaussian signal .",
    "the question of how this optimal scale can be determined is addressed below .",
    "the error on the estimate of @xmath1 is then given by the scatter at this optimal smoothing scale .",
    "combining the data from different smoothing scales does not improve the accuracy on @xmath1 , but is still useful as a consistency check .",
    "we now turn to the use of non - gaussian signatures induced by lensing to measure cosmological parameters . in this section we will discuss the one point distribution function ( pdf ) . the pdf has been previously studied by wambsganss et al . ( 1995 , 1998 ) who focussed on the high magnification regime",
    ". we will first present pdf s for various cosmological models in the absence of noise , highlighting qualitative differences between them .",
    "simulated data with noise due to the finite number density of galaxies with large intrinsic ellipticities will then be used to address the question of how to extract @xmath1 from weak lensing data .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the qualitative features of the pdf are illustrated in figure [ figdeltapdf ] and figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the pdf for four different cosmological models at four different smoothing lengths , assuming the sources are at @xmath166 .",
    "the models are : open @xmath198 model , flat @xmath198 model , flat @xmath199 model ( all with the shape @xmath200 ) and flat @xmath199 with @xmath201 ( standard cdm ) , from top to bottom at the peak values of the pdf .",
    "these are the same models as in figure [ figpower ] for the power spectrum . at the largest smoothing length ( 8 top hat radius , upper left ) the pdf s are close to a gaussian .",
    "there is a large scatter because of the small number of cells at this smoothing level ( about 100 per simulation averaged over 10 realizations in this case ) .",
    "we use the same smoothing length for all the models which will facilitate comparison of the pdf s with noise added .",
    "since the models are normalized to satisfy cluster abundance constraints the rms values at a given scale are comparable ( @xcite ) , so that if the pdf s for different models were gaussian , the curves would be very close together .",
    "as we decrease the smoothing lengths shown in figure [ fig1 ] to 4 ( upper right ) , 2 ( lower left ) and 1 ( lower right ) , the pdf becomes more and more non - gaussian .",
    "this leads to two qualitatively different features .",
    "overdense regions have collapsed into dense structures giving rise to a tail of high @xmath14 that extends to larger and larger values as we reduce the smoothing . at the smallest scales @xmath14 approaches unity in some regions where strong lensing can occur . in the quasilinear regime on larger scales",
    "the amount of non - gaussianity depends on the rms in the density perturbations at the smoothing scale",
    ". we may loosely describe the smoothing scale in 3-d as the angular smoothing scale in 2-d multiplied with the half distance to the galaxies , where the lensing probability peaks . comparing between an open and flat model with the same rms",

    "a larger rms @xmath11 implies non - gaussian signatures are more important and lead to an enhancement of the pdf at large positive @xmath14 .",

    "there is an even more robust qualitative difference .",
    "nonlinear evolution sweeps matter from underdense regions and puts it into collapsed halos or filaments and sheets connecting them .",
    "this happens very early in an open universe , so that there are large regions of empty space throughout the line of sight .",
    "many lines of sight propagate through empty space in such a model and the pdf peaks sharply very close to the smallest possible value at small smoothing lengths and drops to 0 rapidly below that . in a flat universe clustering",
    "evolves more rapidly at low redshift , so that the universe is more weakly clustered at @xmath203 compared to an open universe .",
    "in addition , cluster abundance normalization gives a lower amplitude for fluctuations in a flat universe at the 10 @xmath4mpc scale even at the present epoch .",
    "for a flat universe the peak in the pdf is thus not close to the minimum value and its shape is less steep , at least for smoothing scales of 1 and larger .",
    "[ fig1gamma ]    the minimum value of reconstructed @xmath14 is proportional to the density parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this is the reason that the minimum value of @xmath14 in an open universe is much smaller than the corresponding value in a flat universe at small smoothing angles , even if the rms is comparable or even larger .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath14 can be used as a direct measure of the density in the universe , once the redshift distribution of background galaxies is known .",
    "this does depend somewhat on the geometry , as the pathlength and angular scale differ between open and cosmological constant models with the same @xmath1 .",
    "the empty beam gives the minimum value of @xmath204 for @xmath140 compared to @xmath205 for the open @xmath198 model and @xmath206 for the cosmological constant model .",
    "note however that while in the open universe the measured minimum value is close to the above value ( because there are many beams which are almost empty ) , in the flat universe the lowest measured value is far from the empty beam value .",
    "the difference in @xmath207 is therefore smaller and one has to use the full shape of the pdf in addition to the minimum value to estimate @xmath1 . , which would not be the case if most lines of sight were empty . ]    for completeness we show the pdf of @xmath108 in figure [ fig1gamma ] .",
    "this pdf is harder to interpret than that of @xmath14 , but is simpler to construct from observational data , since it does not require large enough fields to reconstruct @xmath14 accurately .",
    "it is evident that even directly with data on @xmath108 the pdf can discriminate between models with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "a complete study of the best way to extract @xmath1 from the pdf of @xmath108 constructed from noisy data will not be presented here .",
    "we proceed instead with a detailed exploration of the non - gaussian features in the pdf of the reconstructed @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig9 ]    figure [ fig1 ] assumes all the galaxies are at @xmath166 .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows how the pdf changes with the redshift of galaxies for the open model . from top to bottom are pdf s for sources at @xmath208 , @xmath166 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the deviations from gaussianity are larger at low @xmath211 .",
    "this is because as @xmath211 increases , one projects a larger number of independent regions . by the central limit theorem",
    "this leads to a gaussian distribution , even though the 3-d pdf of density is very non - gaussian ( approximately a lognormal ) . on the other hand",
    ", the rms of the convergence ( the width of the pdf ) is increasing with redshift , so that the observability of the effect is likely to increase with redshift , because noise masks the non - gaussian signal when the rms is small .",
    "from the considerations above it follows that if one could measure the pdf on small scales directly one could easily determine @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not feasible because of noise . as discussed in the introduction",
    "the main source of random noise is the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies .",
    "in addition , at faint magnitudes measurement errors can cause a significant error in the ellipticity determination .",
    "we will model the ellipticity noise as a gaussian with 0.4 dispersion for each component , roughly in agreement with observational constraints .",
    "the gaussian assumption for the noise is not crucial in this context .",
    "the data used is first smoothed , which makes the noise more gaussian .",
    "in addition , even if the noise is non - gaussian it will not create an asymmetry between positive and negative @xmath14 , so at least for statistics like the odd moments this will not introduce a bias .",
    "in practice one should use the actual statistical distribution of ellipticities , which can be obtained from the data itself under the assumption that in the unsmoothed data , ellipticities induced by weak lensing are negligibly small .",
    "[ figkappa ]    the number density of galaxies depends on the limiting magnitude of the observation . here",
    "we assume @xmath187 galaxies per square degree , which is at the limit of ground based observations with several hour exposures ( e.g. luppino & kaiser 1997 ) .",
    "as before all the galaxies are placed at @xmath166 .",
    "our goal is to check using realistic examples if the signal is detectable and what method is best to analyze the data ; the details will clearly depend on the specifics of the survey one has in mind . to generate a noisy version of the data we randomly generate galaxy positions on a square grid of a given size and add the weak lensing shear to a random ellipticity component in each of them .",
    "we then reconstruct @xmath14 from these noisy data using the relation between the fourier transforms of @xmath14 and @xmath212 , again assuming periodic boundary conditions : @xmath213 the reconstructed @xmath14 field smoothed at the scale where noise exceeds the signal is compared to the same field without noise in figure [ figkappa ] .",
    "[ fig2 ]    figure [ fig2 ] shows pdf s for all the models in figure [ fig1 ] , with noise added . on large scales",
    "the noise is negligible and the pdf s are similar to the no noise case . on very small scales",
    "the noise is large and dominates over the cosmological signal , so that the pdf is simply a gaussian with rms@xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the mean number of galaxies in a smoothing patch . in both limits",
    "the distribution is gaussian , so we can not learn anything about non - gaussianity . in the intermediate regime , on scales of @xmath216 and @xmath217 , differences between models are still visible .",
    "one can hope that there is sufficient signal to noise to extract useful information from the data .",
    "we discuss next what the optimal scale is and what statistics are best to extract the signal from the data .",
    "having argued that real space statistics exhibit stronger non - gaussian signatures we need to decide which to choose .",
    "the first set of statistics to try are the moments @xmath218 , for @xmath219 this is the skewness already introduced above .",
    "although one may argue that the pdf contains more information than any of the reduced statistics , the moments can nevertheless be useful because of their simplicity and relative model independence .",
    "one advantage of moments is the availability of perturbation theory , with which one can compare the observations on large scales .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the moments are sensitive to rare events in the tails of the distribution .",
    "the results can be strongly dependent on the presence or absence of a few clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has two consequences : first , sampling variance becomes a more important source of noise as we progress from lower to higher order moments .",
    "second , numerical accuracies of simulation codes become an issue and it becomes difficult to accurately calibrate the observations in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this has prompted some workers to try alternatives such as the moments of absolute values ( nusser & dekel 1993 ; juszkiewicz et al .",
    "these are less sensitive to the rare events , but are more sensitive to the presence of noise as shown below .",
    "based on these arguments we will concentrate on four low order moments , all of which can be expressed in terms of the lowest nonvanishing contribution from the third moment @xmath220 and so can be compared to perturbation theory predictions . the simplest way to compute @xmath195",
    "is simply by its definition above .",
    "this statistic is plotted in the lower right panel of figure [ fig6 ] . shown",

    "the important point is that @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is a weak function of the shape of the power spectrum , but not of its amplitude . that this function only weakly depends on the spectral shape is seen from the comparison of @xmath223 and @xmath201 models in figure [ fig6 ] ,",
    "both of which give almost identical perturbation theory results . at a given redshift the perturbation theory predictions depend somewhat on the assumed geometry and pathlength , causing a difference of order 15% between a cosmological constant model and an open model with the same matter density @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig6 ]    the results of n - body simulations agree with perturbation theory on large scales , although the scatter in individual realizations is large even in the absence of noise . on small scales",
    "@xmath195 rises above its perturbation theory value by different amounts depending on the model . for the open model",
    "the rise above the perturbation theory value is a factor of 2 on very small scales , while for the cosmological constant model there is no rise at all .",
    "moreover , there is also a dependence on the shape of the power spectrum , resulting in different predictions for @xmath195 between @xmath223 and @xmath201 models .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between the low and high @xmath1 models is clearly seen .",
    "thus in the absence of noise due to the finite number of galaxies , the statistical significance would be enormous .",
    "the interpretation of the result however is complicated by the shape and geometry dependences on very small scales .",
    "for this reason it is better to use the data on more intermediate scales , where the deviations from perturbation theory are smaller .",
    "this conclusion will be further strengthened when we discuss the effects of noise .",
    "two other statistics related to @xmath195 in perturbation theory are @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "these statistics have been suggested by nusser & dekel ( 1993 ) and juszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as a way to reduce the sampling variance from rare events which populate the tails of the distribution and strongly affect the higher moments . because of quadratic weighting one can expect these statistics to be more robust .",
    "the contributions from positive and negative @xmath14 are separated because they probe different physical regions , halos and voids , respectively .",
    "we use the edgeworth expansion of the pdf around the gaussian to compute the perturbation theory values of these statistics ( juszkiewicz et al .",

    "we plot @xmath195 obtained using this method separately for positive values ( upper left plot ) and negative values ( upper right ) .",
    "the predictions of perturbation theory again agree with n - body simulations on large scales , albeit with large scatter . on small scales",
    "the positive @xmath14 statistic remains approximately constant , while the negative @xmath14 statistic drops in value towards 0 .",
    "this is expected , because @xmath14 is bounded from below , so the rms over negative values can not exceed the minimum value , while the full rms in the denominator continues to grow on small scales .",
    "the fourth statistic we measured is @xmath230 , which is the sum over all negative @xmath14 minus the sum over all positive @xmath14 , normalized by the total number of @xmath14 .",
    "this statistic is the least sensitive to the tails and should be very robust to the details in high density regions . again using the edgeworth expansion we find at lowest order @xmath231 the @xmath195 measured from this statistic",

    "it shows the same properties as the statistics discussed above .",
    "it agrees with perturbation theory on large scales , but with large scatter . on small scales",

[ fig7 ]    we now add noise due to the finite number of source galaxies to the simulated maps and compute the same statistics as in figure [ fig6 ] in a @xmath232 field , shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "noise introduces significant scatter and makes some of the statistics biased . the third moment",
    "( lower right panel ) has the advantage that it is unbiased even in the presence of noise . to show this we can write the measured @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the true convergence and @xmath76 is the noise component .",

    "then @xmath237 since @xmath238 .",
    "note that by symmetry the latter relation still holds even if the ellipticity distribution is not gaussian .",
    "similarly we can correct @xmath195 so that it is unbiased ( hui & gazta~ naga 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , for the other three statistics noise introduces bias and @xmath195 is generally suppressed relative to the case of no noise .",
    "this is because in the presence of noise some @xmath14 switch sign , which reduces the signal from these statistics which are defined relative to the 0 mean . unlike in the case of @xmath239 ,",

    "this is best performed with n - body simulations .",
    "if one corrects for noise bias one can see from figure [ fig7 ] that the optimal angular scale for the detection is around @xmath240 .",
    "the detection is at a several @xmath179 level for the first method and a similar significance level is achieved if one combines the second and third methods ( which use two disjoint parts of the data set ) , but at the expense of a more complicated noise corrections .",
    "the fourth statistic fails completely in the presence of noise , as it gives the same value on small scales for all the models . to address the question of required survey size",
    ", we repeated the above analysis for @xmath241 and @xmath242 fields .",
    "we find that @xmath242 field is too small for the signal to be detected at more than a 1-sigma level .",
    "the errors are significantly reduced for a @xmath241 field , which seems to be the minimum required for a positive detection , at least for the survey depth and density we assumed here .",
    "this size is quite realistically achievable in the near future , as there are several multi - square degree surveys under development which will reach the size and depth needed to measure this signal .    to summarize , both the third moment and the combination of the second moments over positive and negative values show clear signature of a non - gaussian signal even in the presence of noise .",
    "the third moment @xmath243 is the most sensitive and is unbiased in the presence of noise bias . on the other hand , it is somewhat more sensitive to numerical calibration errors than the two quadratic weighting methods . it is recommended that all the methods are applied to the data and the results tested for consistency .",
    "moments of order higher than 3 are to be avoided because of sensitivity to the rare events in the tails and to uncertainties in the numerical simulations .",
    "the lowest order method , based on the difference between negative and positive values , fails in the presence of noise .",
    "[ fig4 ]    all the results shown above have used p@xmath116 m simulations .",
    "it is instructive to compare them to faster pm simulations , which are expected to agree with p@xmath116 m simulations except in very dense regions .",
    "this is more important on small scales and/or higher moments .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the comparison between the pdf for pm and p@xmath116 m simulations for the @xmath198 model .",
    "while the p@xmath116 m simulation has @xmath128 particles and is one of the highest resolution simulations existing at present , the pm simulation used @xmath127 particles on a @xmath128 grid and only required of order 10 cpu hours on a single processor workstation .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement in the pdf is quite good for all the smoothing lengths and only on the smallest scales does one see small differences .",
    "these results are reassuring and indicate that if one is using the pdf away from the tails the faster pm simulations suffice . however , the signatures in the tails are more discriminatory , so it is important to test any statistic one is using for its sensitivity to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "[ fig3 ]    the comparison of results for @xmath195 between pm and p@xmath116 m simulations is shown in figure [ fig3 ] for the @xmath198 model . on large scales",
    "both simulations give results that are in agreement with each other and with perturbation theory . on small scales differences",
    "are evident , more significantly for those measures that weight the positive tail of the pdf more strongly .",
    "this is especially true for the third moment method ( lower right ) , which is based on averaging @xmath244 and so most strongly weights the high density regions .",
    "the difference between pm and p@xmath116 m in this case reaches a factor of 2 on small scales .",
    "the pm simulation is clearly inadequate for this statistic . in general these results",
    "show that for higher moments the pm simulations have to tested and calibrated with p@xmath116 m as the resolution range is difficult to estimate a priori .",
    "one may worry that the p@xmath116 m results may also be sensitive to numerical resolution on the smallest scales , so it is better to use statistics most sensitive to the tails on larger scales where the differences are smaller .",
    "the alternative to moments for probing non - gaussianity is to use the pdf of the reconstructed convergence .",
    "the pdf by definition describes the full distribution of @xmath14 and so is not unduly sensitive to the high density tails .",
    "the simplest way to analyze the pdf is to use the edgeworth expansion ( juszkiewicz et al .",

    "is negligible and the equation above reduces to the edgeworth expansion as in equation [ edge ] . in the limit @xmath249 it reduces to a gaussian with @xmath250 rms , in which case the non - gaussian signature is swamped out by the noise .    to compute the likelihood function on the data we divide the observed region into nonoverlapping square cells and use the average value of @xmath14 in each cell as the input .",
    "the full likelihood function can be written as a product of likelihood functions for individual measurements @xmath251 , @xmath252 individual @xmath251 are not independent ( because of correlations in the signal part of convergence ; note that noise is uncorrelated for reconstructed @xmath14 provided that one uses non - overlapping cells for analysis and the number of galaxies in each cell is the same .",
    "the later is not exactly true because the galaxies are poisson distributed , so there are some residual noise correlations left , which decrease as the cell size is increased ) , so this is not the true multivariate likelihood function for the data even if @xmath253 were the correct pdf .",
    "nevertheless we can continue to use it , as long as we determine the error estimates and possible biases with monte carlo realizations of n - body simulations .",
    "given that this is not the true likelihood function we have no reason to expect it to be an optimal estimator , even in the limit of large number of independent measurements .",
    "one should really view it as another statistic whose performance should be judged empirically by the scatter in the monte carlo realizations . since it uses information on the full pdf and not just its tails , one hopes that it is a more powerful estimator than the moments .",
    "figure [ fig13 ] ( upper panel ) shows the results of the ml method on the edgeworth expansion for @xmath195 for various models and smoothing scales .",
    "the method works well for the flat models , which have a lower @xmath195 .",
    "it agrees with perturbation theory and has very small error bars even on small angular scales where noise is dominant .",
    "visually , the agreement between the edgeworth expansion and true noise convolved pdf is also quite good .",
    "however , in low @xmath1 models there is a severe bias on intermediate scales , where the information content is the highest from the moments analysis .",
    "the problem is that the edgeworth expansion of the pdf does not satisfy the positivity condition for a probability distribution .",
    "it shows nonphysical oscillations because of the oscillatory nature of hermite polynomials .",
    "for some values of @xmath14 the pdf is not positive for large @xmath195 , because the oscillations drive it below 0 .",
    "this happens only over small regions , but if a measurement falls into one of these regions then @xmath254 around it can have very large negative values and the ml method will drive the estimate for @xmath195 and @xmath179 away from this region into the region where the pdf is positive definite , even if visually the overall fit is much worse .",
    "noise makes the distribution more positive by smoothing out the nonphysical oscillations ( kim & strauss 1998 ) , but in the present case , with realistic levels of noise due to the finite number of galaxies , weak lensing data appear to be `` too good '' for a blind application of ml on the edgeworth expansion .",
    "this situation is somewhat paradoxical , because when the data are too good the method fails and one is forced to resort to less accurate methods such as moments .",
    "the two ways to remedy this problem are : change the pdf to make it positive definite , or change the analysis method to allow negative pdf .",
    "we discuss both of these next .",
    "[ fig13 ]      the failure of the ml method based on the edgeworth expansion is caused by an unphysical expansion of the pdf .",
    "this suggests that it is better to use directly the pdf from n - body simulations , which provide more physical templates against which one can fit the observed data . by spanning a large parameter space of cosmological models",
    "one can search for the best model using the ml method .",
    "this seems an ambitious program , since it requires obtaining pdf s from n - body simulations of a dense grid of cosmological models . in practice",
    "it is not so formidable , because a given simulation can be used for many different models and because one can use pm simulations , which are fast to compute and are sufficiently accurate away from the tails .    to obtain a set of templates we first ran a number of pm simulations for different cosmological models . for each simulation",
    "we chose the shape of the power spectrum ( determined by @xmath255 parameter in this case ) , final @xmath1 and final amplitude @xmath256 .",
    "a single simulation can be used not just for the chosen model , but also for models with smaller @xmath256 .",
    "for example , in an @xmath140 model using an output at redshift @xmath211 as the output today corresponds to a model with @xmath257 .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum remains unchanged and for this case @xmath140 for all the models .",
    "for the case with curvature or cosmological constant earlier time output corresponds to a higher @xmath1 . because the shape parameter @xmath255 is unchanged @xmath258",
    "must then be decreased relative to the original model .",
    "thus a one - dimensional family of models can be spanned by the simulation .",
    "another transformation that varies the model is a rescaling of the box size .",
    "for example , using a 100@xmath4mpc simulation as a 200@xmath4mpc simulation changes the shape of the power spectrum so that @xmath259 is reduced by a factor of 2 . at the same time , for a given output @xmath256",
    "is increased , so one has to use an earlier output to obtain the same normalization .",
    "it is therefore possible to use a single simulation to describe a two - parameter family of models .",
    "note that the second transformation changes the angular resolution and size of the simulation , so one has to be careful when comparing the results at a given angular scale .",
    "since each pm simulation requires of order 10 cpu hours on a workstation , one can span a dense grid of models in a reasonable amount of time . here",
    "we will present results as a two parameter family ( @xmath1 and @xmath256 ) , although the third parameter @xmath259 can easily be added if desired .",
    "we again use the ml method to determine the best model using @xmath260 , \\label{lik}\\ ] ] where @xmath261 $ ] is the pdf for the model determined with @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "these pdf s are obtained from the simulations , by binning them into small bins and counting the number of events in them .",
    "if there are @xmath262 simulated values of @xmath14 contributing to the i - th bin then the pdf for that bin is given by @xmath263 . to obtain the log likelihood for a given realization we count the number of @xmath14 in the i - th bin , @xmath264 , and compute @xmath265 .",
    "this expression shows how the weight is distributed in the ml method . around the peak of the pdf",
    "there are many events and so @xmath264 is large , but @xmath266 itself has a small negative value . for the tails",
    "the number of events is small , but each event has a large weight , because @xmath266 can have very large negative value . this way both the peak and the tail of pdf are significant for the ml estimate .",
    "the main drawback with this approach is that one has to use very large simulations to properly sample the tails of the pdf , so that the bins are appropriately populated .",
    "if this is not satisfied then even a single event in the real data falling into a bin that was underpopulated completely dominates the rest of the data . using ml",
    "we are therefore faced with the same problem we had with high order moments , which is that sensitivity to the tails implies large uncertanties because of numerical inaccuracies in simulations . clearly , using information from the rare events enhances the statistical significance of the test , but also increases the `` systematic uncertanties '' that arise from the uncertainties in the n - body simulations .",
    "an alternative to the ml method is a version of the @xmath17 statistic .",
    "@xmath17 fitting can be used both on the pdf from the simulations as a template or on the edgeworth expansion .",
    "for example , we may compute the difference between measured and expected number of values in the i - th bin for a given model and add up the squares of these differences .",
    "we can then again minimize this statistic as a function of the model and explore the errors on the parameters by monte carlo simulations .",
    "in addition , depending on how one weights the differences one can make the central regions of the pdf more or less dominant compared to the tails . with the weighting according to the expected number of events , the tails become more important and",
    "the method becomes similar to the ml method in how it weights the data .",
    "no weighting makes the central region more important .",
    "some intermediate weighting is therefore optimal if one wants to maximize both statistical significance and robustness to the n - body results .",
    "we tried several simple weighting schemes and found that even with uniform weighting applied to the edgeworth expansion , the @xmath17 statistic gave smaller error bars than moments ( figure [ fig13 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath195 was relatively constant as a function of angle and the difference between the open @xmath198 and either of the flat models is enormous at @xmath267 .",
    "both flat models with different power spectra gave very similar predictions .",
    "interestingly , the cosmological constant @xmath198 model is much closer to the flat model than to the open one , so it appears that this test is more sensitive to @xmath1 for open than for cosmological constant dominated models .",
    "comparison between pm and p@xmath116 m simulations gave somewhat discrepant results , similar to those in figure [ fig3 ] , so it appears that this method is also sensitive to simulation resolution .",
    "clearly , high resolution n - body simulations are essential if one is to extract the value of @xmath1 with high accuracy .",
    "finally , we also used the @xmath17 statistic on the pdf templates from simulations .",
    "while this statistic is more accurate than all the statistics previously discussed , the increased accuracy does not appear worth the complexity and effort of simulating models spanning a large range of parameters .",
    "for example , it is difficult to distinguish between an @xmath268 and @xmath198 model , in the sense that using the @xmath17 for one model was often better on the other template ( with appropriate change in the normalization ) .",
    "the sensitivity therefore appears not to be significantly increased if one uses the true pdf instead of the edgeworth expansion .",
    "given the increase in complexity of this method its usefulness may be limited , at least until the data become of sufficient quality to necessitate more accurate pdf s than provided by the simple first order edgeworth expansion .",
    "in this paper we have used ray tracing simulations to study the following aspects of weak lensing by large - scale structure : the numerical requirements for simulating weak lensing on angular scales of observational interest , @xmath269 ; the validity of various weak lensing approximations and of analytical predictions ; computation of low - order statistics for different models and estimates of the accuracy with which they can be measured from given survey sizes ; estimate of @xmath1 using measures of non - gaussianity from simulated noisy data .",

    "* we have used fft s to compute the shear matrix and photon deflections required for propagating light rays in our simulations .",
    "the method has been demonstrated to be efficient and accurate provided care is taken with the choice of numerical parameters .",
    "we give analytical estimates of the resolution limit implied by ( a ) the mass resolution and force softening of the n - body simulation , and ( b ) grid effects in the ray tracing .",
    "these estimates were shown to be reliable and can be used to choose numerical parameters such as the grid size .",
    "lens planes over a broad range of redshifts were found to contribute to the lensing effect . for a given angular size , lens planes at lower - redshift have smaller spatial extent , of order 10 @xmath4 mpc for degree size fields . since the lensing efficiency is a broad function of redshift , non - negligible contributions come from small regions that may contain a single over- or under - density with only a small fraction of the particles in the full n - body simulation .",
    "this is a complication in achieving sufficient accuracy from ray tracing simulations . on small scales",
    "the white noise contribution to the power spectrum from the finite number of particles is difficult to estimate as it depends on the clustering evolution , and therefore on the cosmological model . given these limitations , to achieve a dynamic range @xmath270 in angular scale , it is necessary to use high - resolution n - body simulations with @xmath271 particles , and fft / ray tracing grids of size @xmath272 at each lens plane .",
    "* nonlinear effects and comparison with analytical approximations . * the power spectra measured from the ray tracing simulations ( see figure [ figpower ] ) show that for fields a few degrees on a side the power spectrum of the shear lies entirely in the nonlinear regime .",
    "part of this nonlinearity arises because of the strongly clustered regions at low redshift that affect statistical measures even on degree scales . on scales of observational interest linear theory or perturbation theory",
    "do not provide accurate predictions for 2nd and 3rd moments .",
    "the skewness measured from a reasonable number of degree sized fields is significantly enhanced over the perturbation theory prediction . only for the second moment of the shear and convergence",
    "can non - perturbative analytical calculations be made ( jain & seljak 1997 ) and are found to agree well with the simulations .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use simulations in making theoretical predictions and obtaining error estimates for most weak lensing statistics .",
    "the weak lensing approximation is found to be valid to good accuracy .",
    "the nonlinear departures discussed above arise from gravitational clustering of the matter , not from any breakdown of weak lensing approximations .",
    "there are occasional strong deflections that contribute to the tails of the probability distribution of shear and convergence .",
    "but lensing statistics smoothed on scales larger than @xmath273 do not receive significant contributions from these rare events .",
    "an example of a test of the weak lensing approximation is provided by figure [ figantisym ] .",
    "the rotational component of the distortion tensor , which arises when significant multiple deflections occur along the same line of sight , is shown to be very small .",
    "it is therefore possible to describe the shear and convergence fields as arising from a projected ( 2-dimensional ) gravitational potential .    *",
    "sample size for measuring the power spectrum .",
    "* the power spectrum of the shear directly probes the dark matter power spectrum at intermediate redshifts .",
    "extensive tests have been used to estimate the dynamic range with which we can measure the power spectrum and the accuracy on different scales . for large fields and on large scales , sample variance ( finite number of modes ) dominated fluctuations in the measured spectrum between different fields and can be reliably estimated using gaussian statistics . on small scales",
    "this variance increases relative to the gaussian value because nonlinear evolution generates kurtosis .",
    "in addition , power spectrum estimates from neighboring bins become strongly correlated . for a quantitative analysis of the variance in the power spectrum",
    "it is essential to use numerical simulations . for small fields ( below @xmath274 on a side )",
    "mode - coupling becomes the limiting factor in the variance of power spectrum estimates rather than number of modes .",
    "we found that for fields smaller than 1@xmath167 , it is possible to correct the power spectrum for fluctuations in the mean convergence within every field . with the correction it is possible to reduce the error on the power by up to a factor of 2 , meaning that the errors are dominated by mode coupling on the scale of the sample rather than number of modes within the sample .",
    "measurements of about 10 fields a degree on a side can provide power spectra accurate to a few tens of percent on @xmath275 .",
    "this procedure depends on the knowledge of mean convergence in the field and its translation into mean density , which makes it an alternative , albeit less sensitive , test of @xmath276 to the ones described in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "* non - gaussianity and @xmath1 . *",
    "we addressed the issue of how to extract information on the cosmological matter density @xmath1 from non - gaussian signatures in weak lensing data . in the absence of noise ,",
    "the pdf of the convergence shows a number of characteristic signatures of nonlinear evolution .",
    "in particular , high positive values of the convergence are characteristic of collapsed regions , while low negative values show the presence of voids .",
    "the high density features depend both on the density parameter and somewhat on the shape of the power spectrum , though the dependence on the latter is reduced by smoothing the data on arcminute scales .",
    "the difference between the mean and the minimum convergence is in principle proportional to @xmath1 . in our simulations",
    "the difference does grow as a function of @xmath1 , but the effect is reduced somewhat because in high @xmath1 models structure is more linear at early times , so that there are virtually no empty beams out to @xmath166 .    in the presence of noise the nonlinear signatures are masked and require careful calibration with n - body simulations to extract them .",
    "based on an analysis of several statistics we find that the most promising are : @xmath17 analysis on the edgeworth expansion of the pdf , the third moment , and the second moment separately over positive and negative values , in decreasing order of statistical significance .",
    "the advantage of these measures is that they are simple , agree with perturbation theory on large scales and can be reasonably well calibrated using n - body simulations on small scales .",
    "methods based on a maximum likelihood fit to the edgeworth expansion of the pdf improve the accuracy of the determination , but can give biased results .",
    "methods based on maximum likelihood or @xmath17 fits to the pdf from n - body simulations are the most accurate for a given model , but to span a range of models would require a large number of simulations for a relatively small gain in accuracy .    noise due to the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxy images masks the signal on very small scales . for the second and third moment the optimal regime is around a few arcminutes , while @xmath17 on the edgeworth expansion can give reliable results to significantly smaller scales . with a several degree sized survey of reasonable depth",
    "one can determine @xmath1 to within about 0.1 - 0.2 for open models , and somewhat worse for cosmological constant dominated models , based on the statistical errors .",
    "the accuracy is also limited by systematic effects , such as the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "these effects can be modeled with a power spectrum analysis of the same data .",
    "another source of systematics is calibration with n - body simulations .",
    "based on comparisons between pm and p@xmath116 m simulations we find that the calibration with n - body simulations is relatively secure on a few arcminute scales , while on smaller scales the differences for some of the statistics are quite significant .",
    "this is particularly true for the third moment , which is very sensitive to the tails of the distribution .",
    "for this reason we did not explore moments higher than the third , such as kurtosis , which would be even more sensitive to the resolution of the simulation .",
    "thus well calibrated , high resolution simulations are essential to probe the high density tails of the pdf . finally , detecting non - gaussianity in the weak lensing signal also provides a direct detection of nonlinear evolution of the dark matter . if the results from such an analysis are found to agree with other tests it would provide strong support for the gravitational instability paradigm .",
