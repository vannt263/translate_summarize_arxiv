    "in pure non - abelian gauge theories there is a linear confinement potential between a static source anti - source pair in the fundamental representation of the gauge group at large distances .",
    "the static potential can be efficiently computed by means of wilson loops . c. michael",
    "@xcite studied the potential between static _ adjoint _",
    "sources in the pure @xmath0 gauge theory : the gauge fields screen the sources forming color - neutral objects called gluelumps . at large distances",
    "the two gluelump state dominates the ground state of the system .",
    "a similar situation is expected when these gauge theories are coupled to matter fields in the fundamental representation .",
    "the dynamical matter fields form a bound state with the static fundamental source , a color - neutral static `` meson '' .",
    "one does expect that the potential at large distances is better interpreted as the potential between two static mesons and flattens turning asymptotically into a yukawa form .",
    "so far , this expectation could not be verified by monte carlo simulations . in particular , in recent attempts in qcd with two flavors of dynamical quarks this _",
    "string breaking _ effect was not visible @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath4 around which the potential should start flattening off , could be estimated in the quenched approximation @xcite : r_b2.7_0 , where @xmath5 is the reference scale defined in @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with an estimate from full qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "the same behavior of the potential is , of course , expected in the non - abelian higgs model in the confinement phase .",
    "while the potential in the large distance range could not be calculated in early simulations with gauge group @xmath0 , they yielded some qualitative evidence for screening of the potential @xcite . in our work",
    ", we compute the potential in the higgs model and observe string breaking . a recent study in the three - dimensional @xmath0 higgs model @xcite has reached very similar conclusions to what we find in four dimensions .",
    "for our investigation of the static potential in the @xmath0 higgs model we choose in the conventional bare parameter space @xcite the point @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it lies in the confinement phase of the model , fairly close to the phase transition , where the properties are similar to qcd .",
    "the lattice resolution is of roughly the same size as the one used in the qcd - studies : we obtain @xmath9 .",
    "+ the general strategy for determining the static potential has first been applied in @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions that we used are schematically illustrated in .",
    "we measure a symmetric matrix correlation function @xmath10 , where the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the space - like parts of the correlation functions . these consist of a wilson line or two higgs fields . for fixed spacial separation @xmath13",
    ", the potential @xmath14 is extracted solving the generalized eigenvalue problem @xcite : [ genev ] c(t)v_(t , t_0 ) & = & _ ( t , t_0)c(t_0)v_(t , t_0 ) , with @xmath15 . the ground state energy @xmath16 and the excited states energies @xmath17 are then given by [ potentials ] a v_(r ) & = & ( _ ( t - a , t_0 ) /_(t ,",

    "( [ potentials ] ) we use smeared gauge and higgs fields at different smearing levels . in this way",
    "the rank of @xmath19 is increased to @xmath20 . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "our numerical results were obtained on a @xmath21 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we computed all correlation functions up to @xmath22 on 4240 field configurations .",
    "statistical errors were reduced by replacing  wherever possible  the time - like links by the 1-link integral .",
    "we extracted the mass @xmath23 of a static meson using the variational method of @xcite from a correlation function with one straight time - like wilson line and smeared higgs fields at the ends .",
    "in we compare two different smearing procedures for the higgs field .",
    "the smearing operator @xmath24 ( triangles ) is defined as : [ smearophiggs1 ] s_1(x ) & = & ( x)+_|x - y|=a x_0=y_0u(x , y)(y ) , where @xmath25 is the complex higgs field and @xmath26 is the gauge field link connecting @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the smearing operator @xmath29 ( circles ) is defined as : [ smearophiggs2 ] s_2(x ) & = & p\\{p(x ) + p_|x - y|=a x_0=y_0 ( x , y)(y ) + & & + p_|x - z|=a x_0=z_0 ( x , z)(z ) } , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represents the average over the shortest link connections between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the application of the smearing operator is iterated obtaining a sequence @xmath32 with which the correlation function is evaluated .",
    "using @xmath29 the contributions from the excited states are much more suppressed : at @xmath33 we read off @xmath34 which agrees fully with @xmath35 .",
    "we computed the potential in units of @xmath36 . considering in particular the combination @xmath37",
    ", one has a quantity free of divergent self energy contributions .",
    "it is shown in .",
    "the expected string breaking is clearly observed for distances @xmath38 . around @xmath39 , the potential changes rapidly from an almost linear rise to an almost constant behavior .",
    "we want to point out that if one considers only the sub - block of the matrix correlation function corresponding to the ( smeared ) wilson loops , the potential estimates have large correction terms at long distances . one might then extract a potential which is too high .",
    "this _ might _ explain why string breaking has not been seen in qcd , yet .",
    "this observation is confirmed by the overlap of the variationally determined ground state , characterized by @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ genev ] ) , with the true ground state of the hamiltonian .",
    "the overlap can be computed from the projected correlation function [ projcorr ] ( t ) = v_0^tc(t)v_0 = _ n _",
    "n ^-v_n(r ) t , with normalization @xmath41 . here",
    ", @xmath42 labels the states in the sector of the hilbert space with 2 static sources .",
    "`` the overlap '' is an abbreviation commonly used to denote @xmath43 .",
    "considering the full matrix @xmath19 the overlap exceeds about 50% for all distances , restricting the matrix to the wilson sub - block we find upper limits for the overlaps at @xmath44 of 5% @xcite .",
    "we have introduced a method to compute the static potential at all relevant distances in gauge theories with scalar matter fields .",
    "we demonstrated that it can be applied successfully in the su(2 ) higgs model with parameters chosen to resemble the situation in qcd .",
    "it is then interesting to follow a line of constant physics towards smaller lattice spacings in order to check for cutoff effects and to be able to resolve the interesting transition region in the potential .    from the matrix correlation function one",
    "can also determine excited state energies .",
    "a precise determination of the excited potential at all distances needs more statistics .",
    "one expects that the transition region of the potential can be described phenomenologically by a level crossing ( as function of @xmath13 ) of the `` two meson state '' and the `` string state '' @xcite .",
    "we are planning to investigate this in more detail .",
    "so far , we can only say that for @xmath39 the two levels @xmath45 and @xmath14 are close .",
    "of course , it is of considerable interest to apply this method to qcd with dynamical fermions .",
    "the only possible difficulty is expected to be one of statistical accuracy .",
    "the proper correlation functions can be constructed along the lines of ref .",
