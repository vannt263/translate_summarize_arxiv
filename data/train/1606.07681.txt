    "@xcite proposed the large number hypothesis ( lnh ) , motivated by the occurrence of large numbers in the universe .",
    "however , in this connection an exclusive review on the lnh can be obtained in the work of  @xcite for further reading .",
    "inspired by this theory several scientists  @xcite have been intensively investigated problems on the variable gravitational constant and cosmological constant with variable cosmological term @xmath8 in the cosmological as well as astrophysical realm . on the other hand ,",
    "works have been done on the cosmological models with variable cosmological term within a framework of dissipative thermodynamics as well as in the case of perfect fluid @xcite . as @xmath9 couples geometry to matter , it is reasonable to consider @xmath10 in an evolving universe when one considers @xmath11 .",
    "many extensions of general relativity with @xmath10 has been made ever since dirac first consider the possibility of variable @xmath9 , though none of these theories has gained wide acceptance @xcite .",
    "the varying speed of light ( vsl ) cosmologies was proposed by  @xcite as an alternatives to cosmological inflation to provide different basis for resolving the problems of the standard models .",
    "he conjectured that a spontaneous breaking of the local lorentz invariance and diffeomorphism invariance associated with a first order phase - transition can lead to the variation of the speed of light in the early universe .",
    "this idea was later on considerably revived by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "barrow showed that the conception of vsl can lead to the solution of flatness , horizon and monopole problems if the speed of light falls at an appropriate rate .",
    "@xcite widely studied the dynamics of vsl in theoretical as well as empirical context .",
    "it has in particular been speculated that vsl offers new paths of solving the problems of the standard big bang cosmology which are distinct from their resolutions in context of the inflationary paradigm  @xcite or the pre - big bang scenario of low energy string theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the case of inflationary universe , vsl may provide an explanation for the relativistic smallness of the various physical constants today .",
    "in connection to vsl theory  @xcite introduced a machian scenario in which @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale factor .",
    "this has significant advantages to the phase - transition scenario in which the speed of light changes suddenly from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . on the other hand ,  @xcite have investigated possible consequences of a time variation in the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "the einstein field equations for frw spacetime in the vsl theory have been solved by  @xcite for anisotropic model , who also obtained the rate of variation of the speed of light required to solve flatness and cosmological constant problems .",
    "some other mentionalable works in this field are as follows : ( i ) by assuming energy conservation of observed matter @xcite have solved the flatness cosmological constant problem with varying speed of light @xmath15 , gravitational coupling strength @xmath9 and cosmological parameter @xmath8 , ( ii )  @xcite have found exact constant solutions for cosmological density parameter using generalization of general relativity that incorporates a cosmic time variation of velocity of light in vacuum and newtonian gravitation constant , and ( iii )  @xcite studied perfect fluid bianchi type i model with variable @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath8 .    besides all the above mentioned major works on vsl theory it is observed that some authors  @xcite have proposed a new generalization of general relativity which also allows arbitrary changes in the speed of light @xmath15 and the gravitational constant @xmath9 .",
    "however , this has been done in such a way that variation in the speed of light introduces corrections to the curvature tensor in the einstein equations in the cosmological frame . @xcite",
    "considered the evolution and dynamics of bianchi type i and v universe and obtained exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in a small time scale limit .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the results previously obtained in the framework of the homogeneous and isotropic frw cosmological models to the case of anisotropic ks universe .",
    "in essence we carried out here an investigation to highlight specific features of ks universe which basically represents dust solutions to the einstein field equation and are a widely used family of inhomogeneous cosmological models .",
    "basically , we have generalized the work of  @xcite by considering that the constants are functions of the volume scale factor and obtained the solutions of the field equations under the framework of vsl theory in the small time limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the field equations for ks model are written down in sec .",
    "2 . in sec . 3",
    "we have obtained exact solutions of the field equations for vsl model corresponding to specific time variation law of constants . in sec .",
    "4 , we conclude our results .",
    "we consider the ks universe in the framework of einstein s general relativity . as an additional condition we impose on the physical constants some restrictions as advocated by the lnh and vsl theory .",
    "the line element for ks universe is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the scale factors .",
    "the einstein field equations take the usual form @xmath19    the energy momentum tensor can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21  ( @xmath22 ) be the four velocity , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the fluid pressure and energy density .    for the ks metric ( 1 ) , the einstein field eq .",

    "we obtain @xmath44    in addition to this we introduce the physical quantities related to cosmology as follows : @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the scalar expansion , mean anisotropy parameter , shear scalar and deceleration parameter respectively .",
    "note that @xmath53 for isotropic expansion .",
    "moreover , the signature of the deceleration parameter indicates how the universe expands .",
    "in fact the positive sign corresponds to ` standard ' deceleration model whereas a negative sign indicates an accelerating universe .",

    "however , we would like to conclude here with a final comment that  @xcite investigated the possible variation of @xmath15 in the context of the present accelerating universe as discovered through sn ia observations and show that variability of @xmath15 is not permitted under the variable @xmath8 models .",
    "this obviously impose an observational constraint on the theoretical speculation of vsl theory , however at the same time allows variation of @xmath8 in terms of _ dark energy _ via the background platform of lnh as put forward by@xcite .",
