    "rapidly evolving coherent scalar fields have been widely studied in cosmology .",
    "their dynamics is not only important during the reheating epoch after inflation , but they can also support periods of accelerated expansion in both the early universe @xcite or at late times @xcite . concerning the dark matter problem , non - thermal candidates like the axion @xcite or other massive scalar @xcite or pseudoscalar fields @xcite also fall in this class .",
    "these models can be interpreted as bose - einstein condensates , where the scalar particles occupy the lowest quantum state of the potential @xcite . finally , the possibility of ultra - light scalar fields as dark matter candidates has been explored in different works @xcite by tuning appropriately the potential and initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the general analysis of a homogeneous oscillating scalar field in an expanding universe was performed by turner in @xcite . for a power - law potential @xmath0 , the rapid scalar oscillations around the minimum of such a potential behave as a perfect fluid with an effective equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "his results can be recovered by means of a generalization of the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a fast oscillating abelian vector @xcite , non - abelian vector @xcite or arbitrary spin field @xcite will behave in a very similar way .",
    "the purpose of this work is to analyse the growth of perturbations in these coherent oscillating scalar theories for arbitrary power law potential .",
    "this subject has been mainly studied for harmonic potential models that mimic the standard dark matter case @xcite , as it happens for the axion field @xcite .",
    "it has been proved by using the linear perturbation theory that the axion was equivalent to cdm for high enough masses @xcite . however , gravitational instabilities of oscillations in a harmonic potential are suppressed on small scales @xcite .",
    "this analysis determines the cut - off in the matter power spectrum and its deviations with respect to the cdm phenomenology . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical stability ( ignoring metric perturbations ) of general coherent oscillating scalar dark energy models has been analysed in different works  @xcite , even by considering nonlinear evolutions  @xcite .",
    "they conclude that potentials supporting accelerated expansion are generically unstable with respect to the growth of inhomogeneities .",
    "this work is organized as follows : we will briefly review the standard average approach for the background evolution of a scalar field under a power law potential ( section ii ) , as well as set the equations that rule its perturbations ( section iii ) . after the preliminary discussion , we will analyse the well - known case of a massive scalar by means of an adiabatic expansion approach ( section iv )",
    ". the perturbations evolution of power - law potential models will be studied following the average approach ( section v ) .",
    "firstly , we will compute the effective sound speed , which is in general the quantity that rules the evolution , using the perturbed version of the generalized virial theorem .",
    "this method allows to extend previous results to an arbitrary power - law potential .",
    "also , exploiting this equation , we will be able to derive a general expression for a possible anharmonic correction in a massive scalar theory .",
    "after that ( section vi ) , we will check the validity of the result for the effective sound speed by studying the exact system of equations ( non - averaged ) in both super - hubble and sub - hubble limits . for small wavenumbers",
    ", we will show what is the natural ansatz for @xmath8 ( subsection a ) , whereas in the sub - hubble limit we will study the exact solution of the non expanding equations thanks to floquet s theorem ( subsection b ) .",
    "finally , we will see that at high @xmath4 , a cut - off is always expected ( subsection c ) .",
    "we are interested in studying the cosmological evolution of a homogeneous scalar field which is rapidly oscillating around the potential minimum .",
    "let us then consider a scalar field theory in cuved space - time with lagrangian @xmath9 the equation of motion can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the derivative with respect to its argument . by considering a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric in conformal time @xmath12 , the equation of motion takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath16    following the same approach as in previous works @xcite , we are interested in the cosmological evolution generated by the effective energy - momentum tensor obtained after averaging over the fast scalar oscillations .",
    "thus , we will concentrate on the average einstein equations given by @xmath17 in the particular case of a homogeneous scalar field in flat rw background , they reduce to @xmath18    in order to obtain the average equation of state of the oscillating scalar , we apply a generalization of the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "let us consider that the typical frequency of the @xmath19 oscillations is @xmath20 and let us calculate the average in a certain time interval @xmath21 such that it is large compared to the oscillation period but small compared to the hubble time @xcite , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "we start by calculating the average of the total derivative given by @xmath23 .",
    "thus , if the @xmath19 oscillations are bounded @xmath24    thus , comparing with @xmath25 , we see that ( [ bounded ] ) is suppressed by a factor @xmath26 . using ( [ eqphi ] ) and neglecting @xmath27 terms",

    ", there is a new scale , @xmath4 , independent of the other two : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "if we assume that the lowest @xmath270 coefficients are responsible of the main contribution to the fourier expansion @xmath271 and , thus , @xmath272    the gravitational potential , and accordingly the density perturbation , oscillates around zero as shown in fig .",
    "[ figlargek ] .",
    "because of this fact , all the perturbations vanish in average but the effective sound speed is @xmath273 ( see fig . [ figlargek ] ) according to ( [ cseff ] ) , since in both @xmath274 and @xmath275 , the kinetic term dominates .",
    "in this work we have shown that a coherent homogeneous scalar field oscillating in a power - law potential behaves as an adiabatic perfect fluid with constant equation of state both at the background and perturbation levels .",
    "thus , scalar perturbations are shown to propagate , to the leading order in @xmath276 , with a sound speed given by @xmath1 . the first correction to this expression",
    "is shown to be @xmath277 .",
    "the robustness of the result has been shown by studying the exact system in the sub - hubble and super - hubble limits as well as in the numerical computations .",
    "these results extend previous analysis done in the massive case @xmath42 and opens the possibility of using this kind of models as perfect fluid analogues in different cosmological contexts . in the general case",
    ", we have shown that there are departures from the perfect fluid behaviour on small scales with a cut - off around @xmath278 very much as in the harmonic case .",
    "notice that for @xmath112 the negative value of @xmath279 suggests the generation of instabilities as found in previous works in the homogeneous case .",
    "the analysis performed in this paper could be extended to higher - spin oscillating fields .",
    "in particular in the massive vector case , which as shown in @xcite behaves as non - relativistic matter at the background level , this study would allow to determine the growth of structures and its viability as dark matter candidate .",
    "work is in progress in this direction @xcite .",
