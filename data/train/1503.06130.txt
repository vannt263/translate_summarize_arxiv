    "recent analysis @xcite of the observations made by xmm - newton x - ray telescope have pointed towards a monochromatic x - ray line with approximate energy 3.55 kev in the spectrum of 73 galaxy clusters ( for a review of dark matter , please see @xcite ) .",
    "the same line also appears in the _ chandra _ observations of the perseus cluster @xcite . in the absence of any astrophysical interpretation of the line due to some atomic transitions ,",
    "the origin of this x - ray line can be explained naturally by sterile neutrino dark matter with mass approximately 7.1 kev decaying into a photon and a standard model ( sm ) neutrino .",
    "this was pointed out by the authors in @xcite and subsequently studied within the framework of specific models @xcite .",
    "several other particle physics explanations of the x - ray line have also been put forward in @xcite .",
    "although most of the particle physics explanations consider late time decay or annihilation of multi - kev dark matter particles as the origin of the x - ray line , there have also been a few discussions on the scenario where the x - ray line can be generated by transitions between electroweak scale dark matter states with kev mass splittings @xcite . in spite of the fact that both kev scale as well as weak scale dark matter candidates can explain the same signal",
    ", their implications in cosmology and astrophysical structure formation can be very different . as stated in @xcite , a kev scale sterile neutrino should have mixing with the sm neutrinos of the order @xmath5 to explain the x - ray line .",
    "such a tiny mixing prevents the sterile neutrinos from entering thermal equilibrium in the early universe , making it necessary to have some additional physics responsible for the production of sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , electroweak scale dark matter particles can be thermally populated in the early universe due to their sizable interactions either through gauge bosons , higgs portals or fermion portals etc .",
    "these scenarios are studied in the context of so - called weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "the fact that the wimp annihilation cross section turns out to be almost equal to the annihilation cross section of thermal dark matter in order to produce the correct dark matter relic abundance observed by the planck experiment @xcite @xmath6 is known as the _ wimp miracle_. in the above equation , @xmath7 is the density parameter and @xmath8 is a parameter of order unity .    motivated by the possibility of explaining the origin of 3.55 kev x - ray line within wimp dark matter framework @xcite , here we consider an abelian gauge extension of sm with two majorana fermion dark matter candidates with a kev mass splitting .",
    "the uv complete model , originally proposed by @xcite and later studied in the context of dark matter and ev scale sterile neutrino in @xcite and @xcite respectively , can naturally explain dark matter and the origin of tiny neutrino masses .",
    "sub - ev scale sm neutrino masses arise both at tree level as well as one - loop level with dark matter particles running inside the loops , a framework more popularly known as `` scotogenic '' model @xcite . recently",
    ", this model was also studied @xcite in the context of explaining the galactic center gamma ray excess observed by the fermi gamma ray space telescope @xcite .",
    "the abelian gauge charges of the sm as well as beyond sm fields are chosen in such a way that the model is free from gauge anomalies and the abelian gauge symmetry @xmath9 gets spontaneously broken down to a remnant @xmath0 symmetry so that the lightest @xmath0-odd particle is stable and hence can be a dark matter candidate . as studied in details in @xcite ,",
    "this model has several dark matter candidates namely , fermion singlet , fermion triplet , scalar singlet and scalar doublet .",
    "scalar dark matter phenomenology is similar to the higgs portal models discussed extensively in the literature . in these scenarios , the scalar dark matter self - annihilates into the standard model ( sm ) particles through the higgs boson .",
    "co - annihilations through gauge bosons can also play a role if the cp even and cp odd components of the neutral higgs have a tiny mass difference as discussed recently in @xcite within the context of a different model .    instead of pursuing higgs portal like scalar dark matter scenarios in the model",
    ", we study the fermionic dark matter sector .",
    "this is also relevant to our discussion on the origin of 3.55 kev x - ray line .",
    "this is because , if transition between two semi - degenerate weak scale dark matter candidates with kev mass splitting is the origin of the x - ray line , then the dark matter candidates have to be fermions as one scalar decaying into another scalar and a photon does not conserve spin . as we will see in the next section",
    ", our model has two fermion singlet dark matter candidates with different gauge charges and two fermion triplet dark matter candidates with the same gauge charge .",
    "we can choose either a triplet - singlet or a singlet - singlet combination of two semi - degenerate dark matter candidates to explain dark matter abundance as well as the origin of @xmath10 kev x - ray line simultaneously .",
    "however , the neutral component of fermion triplet needs to be very heavy ( @xmath11 ) in order to reproduce correct dark matter relic density @xcite . to allow the possibility of low mass dark matter",
    ", we therefore confine our discussion to fermion singlet dark matter in this work . that is",
    ", we explore the possibility of two fermion singlet dark matter candidates with kev mass splitting in this model which can simultaneously give rise to the 3.55 kev x - ray line and satisfy experimental bounds on dark matter relic density as well as direct detection cross section .",
    "such fermion singlet dark matter particle will self - annihilate through the abelian vector boson @xmath12 into sm particles .",
    "we also incorporate the collider constraints on such additional vector boson and its gauge coupling .",
    "we find that , although the relic density and direct detection constraints allow a significant region of the parameter space , the collider constraints reduce the parameter space into the s - wave resonance region where the gauge boson mass is approximately twice that of dark matter mass .",
    "we constrain the model further by incorporating the bound from x - ray line data on the decay width of the heavier dark matter particle .",
    "we then check whether the same model can also give rise to the galactic center ( gc ) gamma ray excess observed by the fermi gamma ray space telescope which has a feature similar to annihilating dark matter @xcite .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss whether the chosen dark matter masses are compatible with sub - ev sm neutrino masses and also constrain the model parameters in order to keep the one - loop mass splitting between two dark matter particles below kev scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we briefly discuss the model . in section [ sec : darkmatter ] , we discuss two component dark matter scenario as a source of 3.55 kev x - ray line and gc gamma ray excess taking into account all necessary experimental constraints . in section [ neutrino ] , we discuss the compatibility of light singlet fermion dark matter with neutrino mass and in section [ split ] , we discuss the one - loop mass splitting between two dark matter candidates . finally , we conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "the model which we take as a starting point of our discussion was first proposed in @xcite which has fermion content shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the scalar content of the model is modified in our present work with a different @xmath9 gauge charge for the singlet scalar @xmath13 and a newly added scalar singlet @xmath14 as shown in table [ table2 ] .",
    ".fermion content of the model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lowest upper bound at @xmath15 confidence level from xenon100 experiment on spin dependent dark matter nuclei cross section is @xmath16 for dark matter mass of 45 gev .",
    "here we take this as a conservative upper bound on direct detection cross section and show the region of parameter space in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 planes which gives rise to this cross section .",
    "this gives rise to a solid exclusion line in the figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] so that the region of parameter space above or towards left of this line is ruled out .",
    "similar to the discussion in our earlier work @xcite , we also incorporate the collider bounds on @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "collider constraints on additional gauge bosons masses with generic sm like gauge couplings force them to be heavier than approximately 2.5 tev .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the bounds on the mass of additional boson @xmath12 can be relaxed if it has non - negligible coupling to the dark sector .",
    "the authors showed that for @xmath12 decaying into sm particles with branching ratio @xmath15 and @xmath21 , the lowest allowed value of @xmath22 is approximately @xmath23 tev .",
    "this limit goes up to 4 tev and @xmath24 tev , if @xmath20 is increased to @xmath25 and weak gauge coupling @xmath26 respectively . to apply these bounds",
    ", we calculate the branching ratios of x boson into sm and dark sector particles and find that the maximum branching ratio of x boson into dark matter particles is approximately @xmath27 . according to the analysis of @xcite , this will correspond to an approximate bound @xmath28 tev for @xmath21 .",
    "however , these bounds will be weaker if @xmath20 is lowered down into the resonance region that can be seen from figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "we apply moderate as well as conservative bounds on @xmath22 between 2 tev to 4 tev and show the portion of parameter space left after that in figure [ fig2 ] and figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "it can be seen from the figure [ fig2 ] and figure [ fig3 ] that the bounds on @xmath22 necessarily rules out most of the parameter space in @xmath17 or @xmath18 plane which give correct dark matter properties .",
    "only a narrow region of parameter space near the s - channel resonance @xmath29 is left .",
    "if dark matter mass is light , a few tens of gev , then additional bounds from lep - ii experiment will apply on neutral gauge boson and its coupling .",
    "the agreement between lep - ii measurements and the standard model predictions forces the mass of additional neutral boson to be greater than 209 gev or the couplings to be smaller than or of order @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this will further reduce the parameter space to the region with @xmath31 .    after finding the parameter space which keeps the total abundance of @xmath32 and @xmath33 within the planck limit on dark matter abundance",
    ", we also show the relative contribution of @xmath32 and @xmath33 to dark matter relic abundance in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that @xmath32 can give rise to @xmath34 of dark matter relic density whereas @xmath33 gives rise to the rest of it . since",
    "their relative abundances are different , their scattering probability at direct detection experiments will also be different .",
    "we have taken that relative factor into account while calculating the dark matter direct detection cross section .    in order to fit our model with the observed @xmath10 kev x - ray line data @xcite",
    ", we follow the constraint on the decay width of the heavier dark matter candidate @xmath32 as obtained in@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath32 contributes around @xmath36 to dark matter relic abundance . here",
    "the dependence on @xmath37 arises via the number density of dark matter . in our model ,",
    "the heavier dark matter particle @xmath32 can decay into the lighter dark matter particle @xmath33 and a photon @xmath38 only at two - loop level .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams can be seen in figure [ fig05 ] . in the following we try to make a rough estimate of the decay width due to these two - loop feynmann diagrams , assuming all the fields inside the loop to be around tev scale . using our estimate for this decay width",
    "expressed in terms of the couplings and also using above constraint we obtain conservative bound on the product of various couplings as discussed below .",
    "as @xmath32 and @xmath33 are majorana neutrinos , corresponding to all diagrams in figure [ fig05 ] there will be conjugate diagrams where photon connects to opposite sign particles with respect to diagrams in figure [ fig05 ] . considering those conjugate diagrams and also considering all heavy masses in the internal line of the diagrams almost degenerate and neglecting electron mass , the decay width can be approximated as    @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to lorentz invarient form factors connected to electric dipole moment transition and purely magnetic moment transition respectively . in general both of them will be contributing to such decays if there is @xmath4 violating interactions involving @xmath32 as well as @xmath33 .",
    "however , here we assume that @xmath4 is not violated by the interactions involving @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then two possible @xmath4 eigenvalues @xmath43 are possible for majorana particles like @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "so , either @xmath44 and @xmath33 will have same @xmath4 eigenvalues or opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues . for same @xmath4 eigenvalues we get purely electric dipole moment transition for which @xmath45 in eq . and for opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues",
    "we get purely magnetic moment transition @xcite for which @xmath46 . taking the constraint into account",
    ", we have @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\   \\sim 6.2 \\times 10^{-47 } m_{n_r } \\ ; \\text{gev }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 taking @xmath49 gev , @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 tev , this constraint can be naturally satisfied if @xmath52 as will be discussed in the next sections , to satisfy the constraints from light neutrino masses as well as the one - loop mass splitting between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues of @xmath32 and @xmath33 seem to be appropriate .",
    "after constraining the model parameters from dark matter , collider as well as the @xmath10 kev x - ray line data , we check if the model can explain the galactic center gamma ray excess for the same region of parameter space .",
    "recent analysis @xcite of the fermi gamma ray space telescope data has shown an excess of gamma rays with a peak of @xmath53 gev in the region surrounding the galactic center .",
    "also reported by earlier analysis @xcite , the spectral shape of the gamma rays has a feature which resembles annihilating dark matter .",
    "one obtains better fit of the observed gamma ray excess from the annihilation of dark matter to @xmath2 pairs for dark matter mass @xmath54 gev@xcite with the constraint on the cross - section @xmath55@xcite .",
    "fit with the observed gamma ray excess for other masses of the dark matter with different annihilation channels has been discussed in reference@xcite . in our subsequent analysis",
    "we have considered particularly dark matter mass @xmath54 gev .",
    "since we have two dark matter candidates with a mass difference of @xmath10 kev , we consider the mass of @xmath32 to be @xmath56 gev and that of @xmath33 to be 35 gev .",
    "we then show in figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the region of parameter space in @xmath17 and @xmath18 planes for which the total annihilation cross section of @xmath57 matches the one mentioned above in order to produce the observed gamma ray excess .",
    "we include their relative abundance factors while calculating the annihilation cross sections needed to produce galactic center gamma ray excess .",
    "the allowed mass of neutral vector boson becomes around 70 gev which faces severe constraints from lep - ii data and further constrains the coupling @xmath58 , as discussed earlier .",
    "similarly , we find small allowed parameter space for @xmath59 and @xmath60 tev where for simplicity we have assumed @xmath61 as mentioned just above equation .    it should be noted , taking into account of the recent work @xcite , that the model of one - loop radiative neutrino mass with dark matter originally proposed by ma and popularly known as `` scotogenic '' model @xcite suffers from a hierarchy type problem which can spoil the phenomenological success of this model .",
    "the problem occurs due to the contributions from heavy majorana neutrinos through renormalisation group evolution ( rge ) to the mass parameters of the scalar fields which are odd under the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry of the model . if , for some parameter space of the model , the mass parameters of the @xmath0-odd scalars turn negative at some energy scale , it will break the @xmath0 symmetry resulting in the loss of a cold dark matter candidate in terms of the lightest @xmath0-odd particle .",
    "although the model we are studying is an extension of the original ma s model by a gauge symmetry @xmath9 , the effective low energy model below the @xmath9 breaking scale is a ma type model with heavy majorana neutrinos and a @xmath0 symmetry under which several scalar fields are odd .",
    "as shown by the authors of @xcite , one can prevent the mass parameters of the @xmath0-odd scalars from turning negative if the physical @xmath0-odd scalar masses are restricted to a certain ranges , typically of the order of the heaviest majorana neutrino . since our dark matter candidates are singlet @xmath0-odd majorana fermions and instead of @xmath0-odd scalars , these constraints can be satisfied easily without affecting the dark matter phenomenology discussed above .",
    "the origin of tiny neutrino masses was discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "the tiny masses can arise at both tree level as well as one - loop level through the feynman diagram shown in earlier works @xcite .",
    "since out of the three singlet neutrinos @xmath62 , only @xmath63 gives rise to a dirac mass term @xmath64 for the neutrinos through the vev of @xmath65 ( denoted as @xmath66 ) , only one of the neutrinos acquire a non - zero mass at tree level through type i seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the tree level mass for the light neutrino in terms of the dirac mass term and the mass of the heavy singlet neutrino @xmath63 ( @xmath67 ) can be written as @xmath68 from figure [ fig3 ] , we see that the allowed region from dark matter as well as collider constraints suggest @xmath69 tev , so we have taken @xmath70 tev and @xmath71 tev . since @xmath72 gev , for light neutrino masses to be at sub - ev scale , the equation ( [ neutmass ] ) suggest that the yukawa couplings @xmath73 have to be around @xmath74 which is approximately same as the electron yukawa coupling in the sm",
    ". the other two sm neutrinos can acquire non - zero masses only when one - loop contributions are taken into account . as discussed in @xcite , the one - loop contribution @xmath75 to neutrino mass is given by @xmath76 assuming all the scalar masses in the loop diagram to be almost degenerate and written as @xmath77 then @xmath78 , \\label{scaldeg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 . for fermion",
    "singlet light dark matter , @xmath80 and hence the above expression can be approximated as @xmath81 the one - loop neutrino mass can be written as @xmath82 taking @xmath83 to be at 5 tev and @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 at electroweak scale and the singlet mass @xmath86 at 100 gev , the above expression can give rise to ev scale neutrino mass if @xmath87 whereas for singlet mass @xmath86 at 35 gev , this constraint becomes @xmath88 one may note here that the appropriate explanation for the gamma ray excess from the galactic center can be explained if one considers @xmath89 gev @xcite .",
    "the expressions for neutrino masses and mixing angles can be derived using the parameters of the model which appear in the lagrangian written for the model with additional @xmath9 gauge symmetry .",
    "the value of these parameters change while going from high energy scale with unbroken @xmath9 down to electroweak scale due to the effects of rge .",
    "the corresponding changes in the neutrino parameters under rge for the original ma model were studied by @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that the rge effects on neutrino parameters can be quite large in these models , due to the dependence of neutrino parameters on products of several couplings of the model when neutrinos obtain masses only via one - loop diagrams . however , in our case , there is tree level contribution also to the neutrino mass matrix and in renormalising the theory the counter - terms of the broken electroweak phase can be obtained from the symmetric phase by simple algebraic relations @xcite .",
    "so the analysis done in @xcite is not directly applicable in our case . however",
    ", a more complete analysis of neutrino masses and mixing in our model should include rge effects .",
    "for the discussion on dark matter , we assumed the mass of the heavier dark matter candidate @xmath32 to be 35 gev , while keeping the lighter dark matter mass lower by about 3.55 kev . from the yukawa lagrangian of the model in equation , it can be seen that @xmath32 and @xmath33 receive tree level masses from the vev s of @xmath90 and @xmath13 respectively . considering yukawa couplings @xmath91 and @xmath92 of the order of @xmath93 and the vev s of @xmath13 and @xmath90 of the order of @xmath94 tev , with slight difference in the values of these yukawa couplings , it is possible to generate mass differences of @xmath10 kev between @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the tree level .",
    "however such small mass difference at the tree level could change if there is corrections from higher order or loop effects . here",
    "we have checked whether the higher order one - loop diagram as shown in figure [ fig9 ] could potentially contribute and change the tree level estimate of the mass difference between @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath95 in the @xmath57 basis can be written as @xmath96 the one - loop contribution @xmath97 to @xmath98 mass matrix is given by    @xmath99   \\label{darkmasssplit1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 \\label{darkmasssplit3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath103 and these limits are useful as active neutrino mass scale @xmath104 is very small in comparison to other masses . here ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 are the masses corresponding to @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 $ ] respectively whereas @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the masses corresponding to @xmath111 $ ] and @xmath112 $ ] respectively .",
    "as denoted in the previous section , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the vevs of electroweak scalar doublets and additional singlet scalar fields respectively .",
    "we have considered @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    particularly , if we consider @xmath117 and denote the near - equal masses of @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath119 $ ] as @xmath120 where @xmath121 , then @xmath122   \\label{darkmasssplit4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from tree level neutrino mass @xmath115 , if we keep the mass of singlet neutrino @xmath116 fixed at 2 tev or so as discussed just after eq .",
    ", then the yukawa couplings have to be of the order of @xmath123 to give rise to neutrino mass of order @xmath124 ev . considering @xmath125 gev , @xmath126 gev and other parameters mentioned above we obtain @xmath127 even if we consider the couplings @xmath128,@xmath129 and @xmath130 of @xmath131 then also @xmath132 gev which is @xmath133 less than the mass splitting of @xmath10 kev as considered at the tree level .",
    "therefore , with our choices of parameters , @xmath134 is negligible in and hence the higher order one - loop correction does not alter the tree level mass difference of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    to check the compatibility of different requirments associated with    1 .",

    "3 .   obtaining appropriate lighter neutrino mass from tree level as well as one - loop level .",
    "kev mass difference of the two dark matter @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the tree level .",
    "we analyse the conditions in equations , , and respectively .",
    "although the equation is trivially satisfied with any value of yukawa couplings less than @xmath131 but other equations give certain conditions on the yukawa couplings as well as conditions of @xmath4 eigenvalues of the two dark matter particles . from equation , with our appropriate choice of parameters we have obtained @xmath135 .",
    "considering this value of @xmath73 we find that the condition given in equation can be satisfied only for the opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues of two dark matter particles as other yukawa couplings in that equation are expected to be of @xmath131 or less .",
    "considering the condition of opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues in equation and using the value of @xmath73 as obtained from equation we get @xmath136 using which in equation we obtain the following condition on the ratio of different yukawa couplings @xmath137 considering yukawa couplings like @xmath138 and @xmath139 of the same order they turn out to be @xmath140 whereas @xmath141 .",
    "so , in our model with suitable values of the yukawa couplings as discussed above , it is possible to explain the 355 kev x - ray line , tiny neutrino mass and gamma ray excess from galactic centre in a single framework .",
    "we have studied an abelian gauge extension of the standard model which can predict tiny neutrino mass and stable dark matter candidate naturally . in particular , we have discussed the possibility of explaining the recently observed 3.55 kev x - ray line and the galactic center gamma ray excess from a common dark matter origin within the framework of this abelian gauge model .",
    "although the model has both scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates , we choose to study only fermionic dark matter candidates to serve our goal better .",
    "the dark matter candidate is guaranteed to be stable by a remnant @xmath0 symmetry after the abelian gauge symmetry gets spontaneously broken . in order to explain the 3.55 kev x - ray line , we assume the dark sector to consist of two dark matter particles : the lightest @xmath0-odd particle @xmath142 and the next - to - lightest @xmath0-odd particle @xmath32 , both of which are singlet fermions .",
    "the mass difference between the two dark matter particles is chosen to be 3.55 kev such that the heavier one can decay into the lighter one and a photon at loop level . in order to explain the galactic center gamma ray excess , we choose the lightest dark matter mass to be 35 gev and check whether the two dark matter particles give rise to the required annihilation cross sections .",
    "we also take into account the constraints from dark matter direct detection experiments like xenon100 on spin dependent scattering cross section of dark matter off nuclei .",
    "these models can also face stringent limits on new gauge boson mass @xmath19 and gauge coupling @xmath20 . using the results from @xcite where the authors found the lower bound on @xmath22 to be @xmath23 tev for @xmath143 and @xmath21 we also use three different cuts on @xmath22 starting from a moderate 2 tev to a conservative 4 tev on @xmath22 .",
    "these limits will be even weaker in those region of parameter space where @xmath20 can be much lower than @xmath124 .",
    "we find that , even after applying a conservative lower limit on @xmath22 as @xmath144 tev , we still have some parameter space available near the s - wave resonance region which can satisfy all constraints related to dark matter and colliders .",
    "after showing the allowed parameter space in terms of @xmath145 as well as @xmath146 , the common vev of the scalar singlets , we constrain the other parameters of the model from the requirement of producing the correct 3.55 kev x - ray flux , sub - ev neutrino mass and keeping one - loop mass splitting between two dark matter candidates below kev . from the x - ray flux constraints",
    ", we find that the product of four relevant dimensionless couplings have to be around @xmath147 or @xmath148 for same @xmath4 eigenvalues or opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues respectively for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , the constraints from sub - ev neutrino masses keep the product of four relevant dimensionless couplings tuned at around @xmath149 for singlet fermion dark matter masses of a few tens of gev .",
    "constraints from tree level light neutrino mass and decay of heavier dark matter to lighter dark matter and photon show that only opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues of @xmath32 and @xmath33 could be possible for yukawa couplings of @xmath131 or less . in our model",
    "the small mass difference between two dark matters of @xmath10 kev considered at the tree level remains unchanged even with higher order corrections .",
    "also the allowed parameter space in @xmath17 plane is very limited .",
    "this is because for light dark matter mass , in order to explain gc excess and 3.55 kev x - ray line together , the constraints from dark matter experiments as well as bound on @xmath22 allow only a limited region near the s - channel resonance @xmath150 . for dark matter mass around 35 gev",
    ", the allowed mass of neutral boson becomes around 70 gev which again faces severe constraints from lep - ii data and further constrain the coupling @xmath31 . due to the very limited parameter space available",

    "<S> we attempt to simultaneously explain the recently observed 3.55 kev x - ray line in the analysis of xmm - newton telescope data and the galactic center gamma ray excess observed by the fermi gamma ray space telescope within an abelian gauge extension of standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a two component dark matter scenario with tree level mass difference 3.55 kev such that the heavier one can decay into the lighter one and a photon with energy 3.55 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the lighter dark matter candidate is protected from decaying into the standard model particles by a remnant @xmath0 symmetry into which the abelian gauge symmetry gets spontaneously broken . </S>",
    "<S> if the mass of the dark matter particle is chosen to be within @xmath1 gev , then this model can also explain the galactic center gamma ray excess if the dark matter annihilation into @xmath2 pairs has a cross section of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the model from the requirement of producing correct dark matter relic density , 3.55 kev x - ray line flux and galactic center gamma ray excess . </S>",
    "<S> we also impose the bounds coming from dark matter direct detection experiments as well as collider limits on additional gauge boson mass and gauge coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss how this model can give rise to sub - ev neutrino masses at tree level as well as one - loop level while keeping the dark matter mass at few tens of gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also constrain the model parameters from the requirement of keeping the one - loop mass difference between two dark matter particles below a kev . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the constraints from light neutrino mass and kev mass splitting between two dark matter components show more preference for opposite @xmath4 eigenvalues of the two fermion singlet dark matter candidates in the model </S>"
