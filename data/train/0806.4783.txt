    "it is convenient to use dirichlet boundary conditions for the light quark propagators ; propagation across the time boundary is not allowed .",
    "if the source time is set in from the time boundary ( four time steps is used in this calculation ) it can be verified that meson masses in the light sector are the same , within statistical errors , as those computed with more usual periodic time boundary conditions .    in order to get some extra suppression of statistical fluctuations and reach the level of precision that we would like , multiple sources were used . for each gauge field configuration",
    "a set of correlators was calculated using different space - time points as the source point .",
    "this set was averaged and the average value was used as the representative correlation function for the configuration .",
    "eight sources per configuration were used in this calculation .",

    "the constraint term for the coefficients @xmath31 was taken to be @xmath32 the priors were chosen to be @xmath33 , which is a very loose constraint .",
    "the constraint term for the exponents ( energies ) has a similar form @xmath34 one might be tempted to choose a constraint which is minimally biased such as equal spacing of the energies @xmath35 and @xmath36 in practice it was found that to prevent the occurrence of obviously spurious solutions , where for example two terms have the same exponent and coefficients of opposite sign , a somewhat tighter constraint is needed . for our fits",
    "we use @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 equal to @xmath40 for mesons and @xmath41 for baryons .",
    "the @xmath42 were chosen to be proportional to the spacing between the @xmath43 with a common reduction factor taken to be 0.83 . with this setup spurious solutions",
    "were avoided and the ground state energy was very stable with respect to changes in the constraint parameters .",
    "for example , it was found that changing prior parameters by 20% led to changes in single - b baryon simulation energies ( which are most sensitive ) of about 1% .",
    "this effect is incorporated into the estimated systematic uncertainty .    to determine the statistical errors ,",
    "bootstrap analysis was used .",
    "a sample of 600 bootstrap ensembles was created and a complete analysis was carried out for each ensemble . in this way the uncertainty in determining the quark mass parameters and the scale is incorporated into the bootstrap error estimate of the final result .",
    "a few systematic effects were examined explicitly . these include sensitivity to the choice of time range for fitting the correlators , to the determination of the b - quark mass and to the choice of extrapolation function in u / d and s quark mass .",
    "in addition , there are systematic errors associated with the omitted higher order effects in the nrqcd action .",

    "radiative corrections to the action then are @xmath46 relative to the leading kinetic term@xcite which we estimate can induce a 1.5% relative uncertainty in the simulation energies .",
    "the nrqcd action is corrected for @xmath47 lattice spacing errors at tree level .",
    "the leading discretization corrections are @xmath48 and a 0.5% fractional systematic error is assigned to these effects .",
    "the action used in this work includes @xmath49 terms and higher order relativistic effects are assumed to be negligible .",
    "the first task is to determine the quark mass parameters and overall scale .",
    "we start with the u / d and s sector and use the pion , rho meson and phi meson masses as experimental input .",
    "lattice masses for these mesons are calculated with the eight ensembles in table iii . for each correlator",
    "the valence mass was taken to be equal to the u / d mass or to the strange mass .",
    "no partially quenched correlators , with a valence mass different from a sea - quark mass of the same flavor were used in this work .",
    "the lattice meson masses were then fit as a function of quark mass using the vector ward identity ( vwi ) definition of the quark mass @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the point where the pseudoscalar meson mass vanishes when all valence and sea quark masses have this hopping parameter .",
    "the fitting functions are motivated by the study of light quark masses in ref .",

    "the zero - momentum hadron correlator yields a simulation energy to which the renormalized quark mass and energy shift must be added to get the hadron mass .",
    "alternatively the hadron mass can be determined from the kinetic energy . for this purpose",
    "the correlators for @xmath61 mesons carrying a unit of momentum were calculated .",
    "the meson mass m ( lattice units ) is obtained using @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the spatial extent of the lattice , @xmath64 and the difference in simulation energies is just the kinetic energy .",
    "kinetic energies were calculated for @xmath28 at all the heavy bare quark masses listed in sec .",
    "[ sec_detail ] and for all eight ensembles .",
    "it was found that kinetic energies were practically independent of the values of the sea quark masses with no systematic trend which would allow for extrapolation .",
    "therefore for each ensemble an independent determination of the bare b - quark mass was made by inputting the experimental @xmath28 mass and the inverse lattice spacing obtained above .",
    "the values ( in lattice units ) varied in the small range from 2.375(78 ) to 2.416(77 ) .",
    "a value in the middle of this range 2.391(78 ) , obtained from the ensemble @xmath65 , was used as our nominal value for the b mass .",
    "the maximum and minimum values were used to estimate a systematic uncertainty in the hadron masses .",
    "the effect of choosing different values for the b - quark mass was found to be small , typically changing the final hadron mass by an mev or so .",
    "having determined the physical point for the b - quark mass one can get the splitting between the @xmath28 and the @xmath66 just from interpolating the difference in simulation energies for the @xmath67 vector and pseudoscalar channels .",
    "the calculated @xmath68 mass difference is given in table iv and is smaller than the recent value reported by the babar collaboration@xcite .",
    "the underestimate of the quarkonium spin splitting has been a common feature of simulations done with nrqcd@xcite .",
    "the systematic study by gray _",
    "et al._@xcite ( see their fig . 14 ) shows that this quantity is quite sensitive to the continuum extrapolation for light sea - quark masses .",
    "et al._@xcite predicted a continuum extrapolated value of 61(14)mev , somewhat larger than our value at a non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "note that part of the difference between their value and ours is due to @xmath69 terms in the nrqcd action which we include and they do not . from a test run on a single ensemble",
