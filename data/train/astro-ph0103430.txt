    "since the fundamental review by paul hodge in 1971 the known dwarf population of the local group has more than doubled .",
    "the current census of dwarf galaxies , faint objects with luminosities @xmath5 , is around 40 , including all objects that lie within or very close to the zero - velocity surface of the local group ( mateo 1998 ; van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "these tiny galaxies are either dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) , dwarf ellipticals ( des ) or dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) ( grebel 1998 ; van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "dirrs ( @xmath6 ) are irregularly shaped galaxies with recent or ongoing star formation and generally quite low surface brightness ( @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) .",
    "the des have ellipsoidal shapes , are fairly luminous ( @xmath9 ) and typically have a central surface brightness ( @xmath10 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) higher than that of bright dirrs like the lmc or ic10 ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "similarly to their counterparts found in galaxy clusters ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; james 1991 ) some of them have blue nuclei ( bica et al .",
    "1990 ; jones et al . 1990 ) .",
    "they contain mainly old ( @xmath11 gyr ) and intermediate - age ( 1 - 10 gyr ) stellar populations and show in part recent star formation . the dsphs number some of the least luminous ( @xmath12 ) and lowest surface brightness galaxies known to date ( @xmath13 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) .",
    "they do not have nuclei nor a significant central concentration and are dominated by old or intermediate - age stellar populations .",
    "star formation in some of them has ceased a few gyr ago , while in others it has been more extended in time and episodic ( hurley - keller et al .",
    "1998;grebel 1999 ) .",
    "a few galaxies have properties intermediate between dirrs and dsphs and may be evolving from dirrs to dsphs ( grebel 1999 ) .",
    "a clear progression from dirrs to dsphs is evident in their hi - to - total baryonic mass ( stars + gas ) , ranging between 7% and 50 % for dirrs , between 1% and 10% in transition systems , while being lower than 0.1 % in dsphs and des .",
    "the local group dwarf galaxies shows a striking morphology - density relation ( grebel 1998 ) , which seems to be featured even in other nearby loose groups ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2000 ) : dirrs are found far away from either the milky way or m31 , while the early - type dwarfs , dsphs and des , lie within 300 - 400 kpc from the center of the primary galaxies .",
    "the distances of dsphs and des from the center of the giant spirals are sufficiently small to postulate that they are satellites of the dominant spirals , moving on bound orbits in their large dark matter halos ( peebles et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "kinematical analysis of dwarf galaxies in the local group highlights an important distinction between early - type dwarfs and dirrs , namely _ their different angular momentum content_. the stars in dsphs and des are supported by velocity dispersion ( typically @xmath14 , see mateo 1998 and bender et al .",
    "1992 ) , while the neutral hydrogen is known to rotate in nearly all dirrs ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the stellar component is still not available for dirrs but equilibrium arguments suggest that the stars should be arranged in a rotating disk component like the gas .",
    "only the faintest lg dirrs , like sagdig and gr8 ( @xmath16 ) , are dominated by rotation inside their half - right radius but are pressure supported at large radii ( carignan et al .",
    "1990 ; hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ; lo et al .",
    "1993 ) .    despite these differences ,",
    "the surface brightness profiles of dirrs and early - type dwarfs are quite similar .",
    "traditionally , fits with exponential profiles are preferred for dirrs while king profiles are used for dsphs and des ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "however , in most cases an exponential law also reproduces the surface brightness profiles of early - type dwarfs well ( mateo 1998 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; faber & lin 1983 ; hodge et al .",
    "1991a , b ; irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the luminosity grows with increasing surface brightness in dsphs and des , similarly to dirrs and spirals ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; binggeli & cameron 1991 ; bender et al .",
    ".    moreover , both dsphs and dirrs are dark matter dominated and show an anti - correlation between their mass - to - light ratio and their luminosity ( mateo 1998 ) : draco and ursa minor , the faintest dsphs ( @xmath17 ) , have @xmath18 ( lake 1990 ) ) and the dimmest dirrs , gr8 and sagdig ( @xmath16 ) have @xmath19 .    in summary , the similarities existing between dsphs and dirrs are enough to postulate an evolutionary link between them .",
    "for this to happen one needs a mechanism which not only removes the cold gas from dirrs but also drains internal angular momentum and heats the stellar disks .",
    "supernovae feedback is by far the most widely quoted mechanism to expel gas from dwarf galaxies . in the model by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) supernovae can induce substantial gas removal in galaxies with a low circular velocity , @xmath20 100 km / s . for a dwarf dominated by its dark matter halo",
    ", any gas loss would have a marginal dynamical effect on the stellar system that is left behind ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ; burkert & silk 1997 ; gelato & sommer - larsen 1999 ) : as a consequence , after star formation has stopped and the galaxy has faded , the `` newly born '' dsph will maintain the profile and the correlation between luminosity and surface brightness present in its former dirr state .",
    "however , mac low and ferrara ( 1999 ) , who perform a detailed calculation of the energy balance , have shown that complete blow out of gas occurs only in very small halos , with @xmath21 km / s , while , for example , all bright des likely reside in substantially more massive halos ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario has been proposed in which the gas is kept hot and star formation is inhibited at high - redshift by the photoionizing cosmic uv background in dwarfs with halos corresponding to @xmath22 km / s ( babul & rees 1992 ; efstathiou 1992 ; quinn et al .",
    "1996 ; bullock et al .",
    "2000 ) : the stellar component observed in dsphs would have formed prior to the reionization epoch , while dirrs would have appeared at low redshift , when the intensity of the background has sufficiently dropped .",
    "however , neither of these mechanisms acts preferentially close to the primary galaxies and thus no explanation is provided for the morphology - density relation .",
    "moreover , they offer no way to explain the different angular momentum content of the two types of dwarfs .    among mechanisms related to the local environment",
    ", the ram pressure stripping scenario has been invoked frequently for the dwarfs in the local group ( einasto et al .",
    "1974 , faber & lin 1983 , van den bergh 1999 , blitz & robishaw 2000 ) : a hot gaseous halo surrounding the disk of the milky way or m31 would strip the gas from the shallow potential wells of dwarfs moving through ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "sophisticated numerical simulations have shown the effectiveness of this mechanism in the inner regions of galaxy clusters like coma ( abadi et al . 1998 ; quilis et al .",
    "however , observations indicate that the hot gaseous corona of the milky way is three order of magnitude less dense than the core of rich clusters .",
    "a recent work by murali ( 2000 ) has shown that a coronal gas density @xmath23 @xmath24 , at @xmath25 kpc , is necessary for the magellanic stream not to be dissolved by ram - pressure driven evaporation in less than 500 myr .",
    "halo models derived from rosat x - ray observations also yield comparable upper limits ( kalberla & kerp 1998 ) , while models in which lg dwarfs lose most of their gas due to ram pressure ( gallart et al .",
    "2000 ; einasto et al .",
    "1974 ) require gas densities more than one order of magnitude higher .",
    "in addition , even if the coronal gas density were substantially larger than currently estimated ( e.g. blitz & robishaw 2000 ) , ram pressure stripping would be unable to affect the structure and kinematics of the pre - existing stellar component .",
    "thus , although we can not exclude that ram pressure is at play , it hardly seems to be the key evolutionary driver for lg dwarfs .    in galaxy clusters , fast fly - by collisions of galaxies with the largest cluster members plus a secondary contribution of the tides raised by the global potential of the cluster , are capable of transforming disk galaxies in objects resembling s0 or spheroidal galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) by removing both mass and angular momentum .",
    "this mechanism , known as _ galaxy harassment _",
    "affects all galaxy components and is purely gravitational . for harassment to be effective , 3 - 4 collisions per galaxy with a galaxy as massive as the milky way , namely having a circular velocity @xmath26 @xmath27 km / s , corresponding to roughly @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the circular velocity of a coma - sized cluster , @xmath30 km / s ) , are required .",
    "this occurs in clusters , where the collision rate @xmath31 is around 1/gyr , as follows from @xmath32 , where n is the number density of milky way - sized galaxies ( @xmath33 mpc@xmath34 ) , in a rich coma - like cluster ( of radius @xmath35 mpc ) , @xmath36 is the velocity dispersion of the cluster ( @xmath37 km / s ) and @xmath38 is the cross section of the target galaxy ( here we are considering the extent of a typical @xmath39 galaxy out to the virial radius of the dark matter halo , @xmath40 kpc , as it will take a few gyr for a galaxy to approach the cluster core and be significantly tidally truncated ) . rescaling the calculation to the case of an lg dwarf satellite of either the milky way or m31 colliding against a fairly large satellite with @xmath41 km / s ( namely comparable to the small magellanic cloud and having @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the circular velocity of the milky way ) one obtains only @xmath44 0.1/gyr : this is because the number of observed satellites in the halo of the milky way or m31 is much lower than the number of mw - like galaxies in clusters ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) . thus",
    ", unless we are missing a substantial population of satellites , either because they are completely dark or because their baryons have not yet been turned into stars due to some cooling - halting mechanism ( blitz et al . 1999 ) , harassment is negligible in the local group .    if close - by encounters between dwarfs are rare in the local group , only the tidal field of the primary halos can substantially reshape these small galaxies .",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found , using a generalized semi - analytical formulation based on the impulsive approximation and including adiabatic corrections , that the heating of a satellite by the tides of the primaries can be very strong when the orbits are eccentric or have pericenters close to the center of the primary .",
    "these results are also supported by the more sophisticated time - dependent perturbation theory of gravitational shocks developed by weinberg ( 1994a , b , c ) .",
    "typical orbits of subhalos in structure formation models are fairly eccentric , having an average apocenter to pericenter ratio @xmath45 ( ghigna et al .",
    "1999 ) . the orbital time in the milky way",
    "halo is roughly the same as in a coma - like cluster , as @xmath46 and @xmath47 for virialized structures ( white & frenk 1991 ) , and is @xmath48 gyr for an object on a circular orbit halfway from the center of the primary halo .",
    "however , the milky way satellites should have performed a higher number of orbits than galaxies in virialized clusters because the latter typically appeared 5 gyr ago ( rosati et al .",
    "2000 ) , while the galaxy was already in place at least 10 gyr ago ( van den bergh 1996 ) .",
    "semi - analytical approaches limit the analysis to the amount of energy that can be injected by tides into a satellite , being unable to handle with the nonlinear mechanisms possibly excited by such energy input , such as gravitational instabilities in the stellar component , that can lead to substantial morphological evolution . in mayer",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) we investigated for the first time the fate of `` tidally stirred '' dwarf irregulars orbiting the halo of the milky way using high - resolution n - body / sph simulations .",
    "we found that the general properties of their remnants match well those of the dsphs and des in the local group , additionally providing a natural explanation for their observed morphological segregation . in this paper",
    "we carefully describe the techniques used to construct realistic replicas of dwarf irregulars , and we study in depth their dynamical evolution and the internal structure of their remnants . in addition , by carrying out an unprecedented number of high - resolution n - body simulations ( more than 50 ) , we explore a much wider parameter space in terms of both the orbital parameters and the internal structure of the satellites , obtaining a statistical sample for a detailed comparison with observations .",
    "finally , with our present study we aim to identify the basic conditions for tidal stirring to be effective as well as at testing its predictions within the framework of hierarchical structure formation against observations .",
    "the simulations were performed with pkdgrav ( stadel & quinn , in preparation ) , a fast , parallel binary treecode , or , when a gas component is also included , with a newer version of the same code , gasoline , which implements an sph algorithm for solving the hydrodynamical equations and radiative cooling ( wadsley , stadel & quinn , in preparation ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 and 3",
    "we illustrate , respectively , the initial dwarf galaxy models and orbital configurations . in section 4 we follow the dynamical evolution of the satellites , while section 5 is devoted to the structural properties of the remnants .",
    "in section 6 we test the tidal stirring scenario , varying the internal structure of the satellites , the orbits and the structure of the primary halo . in section 7",
    "we derive the star formation history of the satellites , and section 8 concerns the gross observational properties of the remnants .",
    "finally , in section 9 we discuss the main results and draw our conclusions .",
    "the models of dwarf irregular galaxies are constructed using the technique of hernquist ( 1993 ) , which has been extensively shown to produce stable configurations for systems with more than one component . in the present work",
    ", galaxies normally comprise an exponential stellar disk embedded in an extended truncated isothermal dark matter halo . in some cases",
    "a cold gas component is also present in the disk .",
    "the profile of the dark matter halo is given by :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the halo mass , @xmath51 serves as a cut  off radius , @xmath52 is the `` core '' radius , and @xmath53 is a normalization constant defined by @xmath54 ^{-1 } \\ $ ] , where @xmath55 .",
    "the stellar disks initially follow the density profile ( in cylindrical coordinates ) :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the disk mass , @xmath58 is the radial scale - length , and @xmath59 is the vertical scale - thickness .",
    "the particles used to represent the gaseous disk follow roughly the same density profile of the disk stars but their vertical scale  height depends on the temperature of the gas ; as an example , for a gas temperature @xmath60 k the gas layer is thinner than the stars for vertical stellar dispersions similar to those in the milky way disk .",
    "our procedure for `` building '' dwarf galaxies involves the joint use of observations and theoretical models of structure formation .",
    "we build two basic galaxy models , a high surface brightness ( hsb ) dwarf and a low surface brightness ( lsb ) dwarf ( hm1 and lm1 , respectively , described in section 2.1 ) .",
    "we then construct other models by keeping fixed the mass of the halo and disk while varying the other structural parameters ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "we also construct models with different total masses ( section 2.2 and 2.3 ) using the scaling relations for objects forming in cold dark matter cosmogonies ( e.g. mo , mao & white 1998 ) .      in a scenario in which galaxies form from the cooling of gas inside dark matter halos ( white & rees 1978 , white & frenk 1991 ) ,",
    "the baryons settle into a disk rotating in centrifugal equilibrium within the halo , and thus the rotational velocity equals the circular velocity of the halo .",
    "therefore , once we fix the circular velocity @xmath26 of the halo , we determine the luminosity of the embedded disk according to the tully - fisher relation . for our basic models , lm1 and hm1",
    ", we choose a halo circular velocity @xmath61 km / s .",
    "zwaan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that hsb and lsb disk galaxies obey the same tully - fisher ( t - f ) relation in the b - band ( although lsbs show more scatter ) , @xmath62 . a rotational velocity of @xmath63 km / s implies @xmath64 according to the t - f relation ; these parameters correspond to the brightest dwarf irregular galaxy in the lg , the lmc ( mateo 1998 ; sofue 1999 ) .",
    "= 9truecm    in order to satisfy the same t - f relation lsbs must have larger disk scale - lengths compared to equally luminous hsbs , because @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the surface luminosity ) .",
    "for the disk scale length @xmath58 of the hsb we chose a value of @xmath67 kpc , while the lsb model has a disk scale length of @xmath68 kpc .",
    "both values are in agreement with the bimodal @xmath69 relation in zwaan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . to fix the disk mass of both hm1 and",
    "lm1 we assume @xmath70 , following bottema ( 1997 ) , which yields a mass of @xmath71 .",
    "once the circular velocity is known , the virial mass @xmath72 and virial radius @xmath73 of the halo ( which we always equate to the tidal radius of the halo , @xmath51 , that appears in eq.(1 ) ) follow immediately from    @xmath74    where , for the basic models , we assume @xmath75 and @xmath76 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 the normalization in the above equations follows from assuming that the critical overdensity for the collapse of objects is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the critical density of the universe , as appropriate for a scdm cosmology . in other more currently favored models , like in lcdm ,",
    "the value of the critical overdensity is marginally different , and thus the final sizes and masses of halos are only slightly affected ( eke et al .",
    "according to ( 1 ) we assign to our basic dwarf galaxy models a ( halo ) virial mass @xmath80 and a virial radius @xmath81 kpc    by changing the _ concentration _ @xmath82 at fixed @xmath51 and halo mass we reproduce the rotation curves of both lsb and hsb dwarfs , as done by de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 ) for a large sample of galaxies of both types ( see also persic & salucci 1997 ) .",
    "following again the same authors , we assume that the halo and disk scale lengths are related and set @xmath83 , thus making hsbs halos more than twice as concentrated as lsb halos given the difference in their disk scale lengths .",
    "we also build two models in which @xmath58 and @xmath52 are not equal to further explore the parameter space .",
    "the rotation curves of the basic hsb and lsb models ( lm1 and hm1 ) and of the latter two models ( lm1rc03 and hm1rc03 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "= 8truecm = 8truecm    in the models described so far the scale height of the disk is fixed at @xmath84 , as suggested by observations of late - type galaxies ( van der kruit &",
    "de grijs 1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "1997 ) , and we set @xmath85 at @xmath86 ; detailed numerical studies have shown that a toomre parameter @xmath87 is a necessary condition for avoiding the growth of spontaneous bars ( athanassoula & sellwood 1986 ; friedli 1999 ) .",
    "different choices of @xmath88 and @xmath89 can determine , respectively , a different susceptibility to the growth of bars and to bending instabilities , the latter being vertical oscillations responsible , for instance , for the buckling of bars ( merritt & sellwood 1994 ; raha et al .",
    "given the chosen parameters , the basic models have structurally normal disks . to further explore the issue of instabilities we construct a small set of models with different values of @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "the rotation curves are not affected by the latter variation of parameters , and they look the same as those of models lm1 and hm1 shown in figure 1 .",
    "= 8truecm    figure 2 shows the stability properties of the various models employed ( including the model of gr8 described in subsection 2.3 ) in terms of @xmath88 and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath92 is the disk radius and @xmath66 is the disk surface density ) , the latter being related to the swing amplifier mechanism that can determine a rapid growth of the @xmath93 modes responsible for the bar instability ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in table 1",
    "the structural parameters of the models are listed ; note that by assuming a smaller halo core radius @xmath52 , ( smaller than the disk scale length @xmath58 ) the @xmath94 parameter increases .",
    "n - body simulations by mihos et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that in encounters of equal - mass galaxies , @xmath95 in the inner disk is enough to stabilize systems with slowly rising rotation curves like those of lsbs , to be stable against bar formation , while @xmath96 is required for disks with steep rotation curves like those of hsbs .",
    "as in our simulations the perturber s mass ( the milky way ) is at least 30 times larger than the mass of the target dwarf galaxy , we will be able to test the validity of this criterion in a radically different situation .",
    "finally , we will test the susceptibility to vertical bending instabilities with model lmh ( table 1 ) , identical to model lm1 except for a larger scale - height ( @xmath97 ) ; this should suffer little vertical heating ( see raha et al .",
    "1991 ) .      to fix the parameters of model galaxies with different ( smaller ) masses",
    "we choose a value for the new mass and then we make use of equations ( 3 ) to determine the new circular velocity @xmath98 and virial radius @xmath73 of the dark matter halo _ assuming @xmath75 and thus @xmath99_. the disk masses and scale lengths are assumed to simply follow the halo scaling ( mo et al .",
    "the resulting models are hm2 and lm2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "as shown by eqs.(3 ) , masses and radii of objects formed in hierarchical cosmogonies depend on redshift _ at fixed circular velocity_. the scaling is contained in the hubble constant :    @xmath100}^{1/2}\\ ] ]    and implies that radii and masses decrease at the same rate , i.e. @xmath101 . as a consequence the density of objects grows as @xmath102 .",
    "some of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies inhabiting the local group must have formed at @xmath103 or higher given the very old age of the bulk of their stellar populations .",
    "therefore , we also build models with masses and radii rescaled as they were formed at @xmath103 ( models lz and hz , see table 1 ) to investigate how the scaling with redshift implied by the hierarchical scenario can affect their evolution .",
    "the intrinsic stability properties of all these rescaled models are unchanged with respect to the basic models because equations 3 and 4 define an invariant transformation with respect to both @xmath88 and @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , their rotation curves look exactly the same as those of the basic models shown in figure 1 , albeit on a different scale .",
    "so far we have used the tully - fisher relation to link circular velocities of halos to luminosity .",
    "hoffman et al . (",
    "1996 ) have shown that the t - f relation exhibits a large scatter at @xmath104 .",
    "the cosmological scaling offers an attractive alternative to set the physical parameters for models of the faintest dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "examples of very faint dirrs are found in the lg ; both gr8 and sagdig have @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that galaxies that faint should correspond to halos with @xmath105 , and that such halos form typically at @xmath106 in cold dark matter cosmogonies ( lacey & cole ( 1993 , 1994 ) ) .",
    "we build a model resembling the gr8 dwarf using the kinematics of the gas at large radii to construct its global potential . at 2 - 3 disk scale lengths the neutral hydrogen in gr8",
    "is pressure supported , with a peak velocity dispersion @xmath107 km / s ( carignan et al . 1990 ) . assuming that the gas is in virial equilibrium with a surrounding isothermal dark matter halo",
    ", the latter should have a virial circular velocity @xmath108 km / s : this fixes the virial mass and virial radius of the halo through equations ( 3 ) and equation ( 4 ) , which are evaluated for @xmath109 .",
    "the disk scale length ( @xmath110 pc ) and stellar disk mass ( @xmath111 ) are the observed values ( carignan et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the chosen @xmath58 and @xmath73 , assuming @xmath112 , imply a very concentrated halo and a very high halo / disk mass ratio ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the resulting central dark matter density is very high , @xmath113 .",
    "this value is slightly higher than inferred for gr8 ( @xmath114 ) but similar to that inferred for draco and ursa minor ( lake 1990 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio at the optical radius ( @xmath115 ) is @xmath116 32 , like that of gr8 not counting the contribution of the gaseous disk .",
    "the rotation curve of the `` gr8 '' model is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we also construct an lsb and an hsb model with a cold gaseous disk which should represent the neutral hydrogen present in observed dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies are generally gas - rich , with an average total hi - to - stellar mass ratio larger than one ( hoffman et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , the gaseous disks are typically two times more extended than the stellar disks ( cote et al . 1997 ; de blok & mcgaugh , 1997 ; young & lo 1997 ) , whereas within the optical radius ( @xmath116 3 disk scale lengths ) , the neutral hydrogen fraction often drops to less than @xmath117 of the stellar mass ( jobin & carignan 1990 ; cote et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "= 9truecm    as we will show , material lying outside @xmath118 is almost entirely stripped when the satellites orbit in the milky way halo and thus would not affect the bound components .",
    "therefore , the gaseous disk included in our model galaxies extends only out to the radius of the stellar disk and its mass is 30% of the total baryonic mass . the total disk mass ( stars + gas ) as well as all the other structural parameters are shown in table 1 ( models lmg2 and hmg2 ) .",
    "the density drops to zero at a radius @xmath119 to mimic the holes in neutral gas distribution existing in the center of dwarf irregular galaxies ( cote et al .",
    "the temperature of the gas is fixed at 5000 k after stability tests in the adiabatic regime .",
    "the rotation curves of both models are shown in figure 4 .",
    "n - body simulations are subject to two - body relaxation effects",
    ". these can be particularly severe when systems of different masses or a system of several components are present .",
    "massive halo particles may heat up the disk even in absence of any external perturbation by colliding with lighter stellar or gas particles : a similar numerical effect is known to be responsible for the premature evaporation and disruption of small subhalos in cosmological simulations with insufficient resolution ( moore , katz , & lake 1996 ) . to minimize numerical disk heating we use lighter halo particles in the central part of the halo ( precisely within 10 disk scale lengths ) where orbital times are shorter and therefore collisions with disk particles are more frequent .",
    "we perform several tests in isolation in order to find the optimal balance between reasonable stability and a moderate total number of particles ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the final models have a disk of @xmath120 particles while the halo is sampled by 208350 in the lsb model and 180860 in the hsb model ( the hi - res halo component in the lsb extends out to a larger fraction of the virial radius because the stellar disk does as well , resulting in a higher total number of particles ) .",
    "for the gr8 model we had to use more than @xmath121 particles in the halo due to the exceptionally high halo / disk ratio : this is the _ highest resolution model ever made for a single galaxy _ with a particle mass of only @xmath122 . in the simulations we use a spline kernel for the gravitational softening as well as for the smoothing length in the sph calculations ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) .",
    "the softening length is a fixed fraction of the disk scale length @xmath58 , thus ensuring the same _ intrinsic _ spatial resolution for hsbs and lsbs and for all their rescaled versions . in code units ( for which @xmath123 ) the softenings are @xmath124 for the stars , @xmath125 for the dark matter particles in the hi - res component of the halo and @xmath126 for those in the low - res component .",

    "a more interesting issue is provided by projection effects : the velocity dispersion measured along the line of sight ( and thus the @xmath219 ) could be overestimated if the unbound , fast moving stars that make up the tidal tails are included by chance in spectroscopic samples .",

    "we derived an upper limit for the velocity dispersion overestimate for both lsbs and hsbs , by selecting the  worst case possible \" , namely two runs with direct orbits ( l01 and h01 , see table 2 and table 3 ) , in which the largest tails are produced .",
    "we viewed the remnant along the orbital plane close to apocenter , where the stream density is at one of its density maxima and the galaxy spends most of the time ( at the turning points of the orbits the stream density is higher because of conservation of phase space density , e.g. helmi & white 1999 ) .",
    "we measure the average velocity dispersion of the bound and unbound stars projected within a distance equivalent to @xmath170 and find the average of the dispersions of the two individual samples by weighting according to the number of stars in each of them .",

    ", the velocity gradient shown in figure 25 suggests that the rotation detected in ursa minor ( hargreaves et al .",
    "1994a ) might be only apparent .",
    "so far we have based our description of the numerical results on the set of satellite models that we consider more akin to observed dirrs and we have placed them on the typical orbits found in n - body simulations of structure formation .",
    "furthermore , we have considered only one form of the primary potential , whose global parameters were fixed again based on structure formation models . in order to figure out how general the `` tidal stirring '' mechanism explored in this paper is , in this section we will relax each of these hypotheses , one at a time , investigating a much wider parameter space .      as already mentioned in section ( 2.1 ) ,",
    "we have built a special set of models which should be the least prone to bar and/or bending instabilities by varying @xmath88 , the initial disk thickness or the core radius of the halo ( see table 1 for the models parameters and figure 2 for the intrinsic stability properties ) .",
    "we mostly placed such models on a direct orbit with moderate eccentricity ( apo / peri=4 , @xmath230 kpc ) : this configuration , in which the excited bar is barely damaged by tidal stripping even in the case of the fragile lsbs , is ideal to study the vertical heating caused by bar - buckling .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure 26 .",
    "an lsb model with a small core radius ( run l21 ) undergoes a smaller increase of @xmath165 ( by about @xmath231 ) compared to the standard reference case ( run l02 ) .",
    "a weaker bar develops because the higher halo central density damps the growth of @xmath93 modes and the buckling is thus reduced due to the lower radial anisotropy .",
    "an analogous result is obtained with an hsb disk embedded in a more compact halo ( model hm1rc03 ) , which has an initial rotation curve very similar to that recently derived by sofue ( 1999 ) for the lmc .",
    "if placed on a nearly circular orbit ( run h11 ) as implied by recent astrometric measurements ( kroupa & bastian 1997 ) , the kinematics remain disk - like at @xmath232 ( stripping is very modest ) , but a thick spheroidal component develops after 5 gyr .",
    "these results qualitatively agree with those obtained by weinberg ( 2000 ) in a detailed study of the response of the lmc to the tidal field of the milky way : the thick spheroid could be responsible for some of the microlensing events seen towards the lmc ( evans & kerins 2000 ) . in the models with @xmath233 ( run l23 ) ,",
    "namely considerably `` hotter '' than the standard models , the bar is also weak and @xmath165 increases by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "= 8truecm    we then explore models with a larger scale height ( @xmath234 ) and @xmath85 ( model lmh in run l22 ) : the vertical dispersion increases by only @xmath235 , a factor @xmath48 less than in run l02 .",
    "this is not surprising because in this model @xmath165 is initially 2 times larger than usual , placing the dwarf well above the critical radial anisotropy level necessary for the onset of bending ( see raha et al .",
    "1991 ) .    despite the different degree of evolution reported in these `` peculiar models ''",
    "the final @xmath1 inside the half - mass radius is always less than 1 , with the exception of run l22 .",
    "however the latter case is rather unrealistic as late - type spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies show a tendency towards very thin disks ( see van der kruit & de grijs 1999 ) .",
    "in general , our evolutionary model seems quite robust : tidal shocks are too strong for the initial stability properties of the models to change substantially the final outcome of tidal stirring .      in this section",
    "we will investigate to what extent the effectiveness of tidal stirring depends on the orbital parameters and , in particular , on the eccentricity of the orbits .",
    "although eccentric orbits are expected for satellites in the framework of hierarchical structure formation ( ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ) , so far observational data on dsphs have been in favour of nearly circular orbits ( e.g. schweitzer et al .",
    "we thus perform a number of runs in which satellite models are placed on low - eccentricity orbits .",
    "lsb satellites on orbits with apo / peri @xmath35 maintain @xmath15 and a disk - like appearance even after 7 - 8 gyr if their pericenters are larger than 150 kpc ( run l08 and l17 ) , irrespective of the disk / orbit orientation . on the other end , if the orbits have equally low eccentricity but considerably smaller pericenter ( run l16 and h09 ) , both lsbs and hsbs do transmute into a spheroidal galaxy after a few orbits . in the latter case the apocenter ( @xmath236 kpc )",
    "is comparable to the present distance of the farthest dsph , leo i , and more and stronger tidal shocks are suffered by the satellite because the orbital time is shorter than in runs l08 and l17 ( @xmath48 gyr instead of @xmath237 gyr ) and the pericenter distance are nearly a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "however , compared to the standard runs employing high - eccentricity orbits ( e.g. run l1-l15 and",
    "h01-h08 ) the velocity at pericenter is sensibly lower ( @xmath238 km / s instead of @xmath239 km / s ) and therefore the encounter takes place in a `` less impulsive '' regime .",
    "therefore , the satellite should respond more adiabatically to the perturbation .",
    "evidently , the lower velocity is not able to counterbalance the effect of the large perturbing mass of the milky way halo when the pericenter distance is sufficiently small . therefore , orbital energy ( or pericenter distance ) is at least as important as orbital eccentricity in setting the effect of tides , as found also by gnedin et al.(1999 ) using a semi - analytical approach .",
    "= 8truecm    from our wide exploration of parameter space we can conclude that the orbital time @xmath240 is the most significant parameter and that tidal stirring has been effective within the past 10 gyr only for satellites having @xmath241 4 gyr , which corresponds to a circular orbit with a radius @xmath242 ( @xmath243 being the virial radius of the milky way ) .",
    "very dense satellites require smaller orbital times , allowing for them _ more and stronger shocks _ ( a smaller orbital time also implies a smaller @xmath244 , see section 4.1 ) , as shown by the simulations of gr8 ; in the framework of hierarchical structure formation this comes out automatically because , on average , they formed earlier and thus fell into the milky way halo when it had a smaller virial radius . thanks to the rescaling properties of halos ( see section 2 ) , the condition on the orbital time is automatically generalized for every redshift @xmath245 if we assume that @xmath243 is the virial radius of the main halo _ at the redshift of infall_.    the present distances of most of the dsphs in the milky way or m31 systems are within @xmath246 ( assuming @xmath247 400 kpc ) and should thus satisfy the constraint on the orbital time .",
    "however , the farthest dsph , leo i , having a distance of about 270 kpc , probably lies at the boundary of the `` allowed '' region .",
    "thus , if leo i was tidally stirred by the milky way , it must be on a fairly eccentric orbit in order to have a sufficiently small orbital time despite its large apocenter distance . at more than 800 kpc from the milky way the tucana dwarf ( gallart et al . 1999 ) could be the greatest challenge for our model if future measurements of its internal kinematics will confirm that it is a dsph in all respects . a few satellites on nearly radial orbits with apocenters just inside the turnaround radius , namely far exceeding the virial radius of the primary halo , are indeed found in n - body simulations ( ghigna et al .",

    "in particular , we consider the case of nearly circular and circular orbits with apocenters @xmath249 kpc ( runs l19 , l20 , lz7 , h10 ) .",
    "orbits of this type would be consistent with the the present distances of some of the milky way satellites , the lmc , sculptor , ursa minor , draco and sagittarius    what would be the fate of a fragile lsb satellite on such orbits ?",
    "our simulations indicate that lsbs are completely disrupted on nearly circular or even exactly circular orbits at a distance of @xmath250 kpc ( run l19 and l20 ) .",
    "the mechanism is simply one of continuous mass loss ( figure 27 ) : the disks of lsbs are so large that the tidal radius falls within them at these short orbital distances and thus they are dramatically destabilized .",
    "the system responds to strong mass loss by expanding and thus reducing even further its binding energy ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; gnedin & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "the destruction is faster on a circular orbit ( figure 27 ) because the orbit - averaged tidal force is stronger .",
    "this is in agreement with n - body results on the survival of cosmological halos on tightly bound orbits ( kravtsov & klypin 1999 ) .",
    "instead , hsbs or lz models ( run h10 and lz7 ) have disks lying inside their tidal radius and thus lose mass only after tidal heating has sufficiently loosen their potentials : they lose @xmath251 of their stellar mass and transform into a spheroidal but survive for several gyr .",
    "we conclude that low surface brightness satellites can not survive too close to the milky way or m31 .",
    "sagittarius might be the nearly - disrupted remnant of such a satellite : what remains of the central part of the lsb satellite , in run l19 and l20 , is recognizable as a density enhancement along the streams for a few gyr and has a maximum elongation @xmath252 , similar to that inferred for sagittarius ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "stable satellites at short distances from the milky way must have high central dark matter densities , as indeed seems to be the case for the nearby draco and ursa minor dsphs ( mateo 1998 ; van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "a primary halo as massive and extended as adopted so far is expected in structure formation models and is consistent with the observed radial velocities of satellites once even the farthest of the group , leo i and leo ii , are taken into account ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1993 ; wilkinson & evans 2000 ) .",
    "a more conservative approach is based on the use of the magellanic stream as halo mass tracer : the stream is likely bound to the milky way and its origin is explained as the result of gas being tidally stripped from the lmc ( putman et al .",
    "1998 ) . under the latter hypothesis",
    "the milky way halo could extend out to only 50 kpc and could have a total mass of only @xmath253 solar masses ( little & tremaine 1983 ) .",
    "assuming then an isothermal profile with a core radius of 4 kpc still yields a circular velocity of 220 km / s at the solar radius , as observed .",
    "we placed an lsb model on a bound eccentric orbit with apocenter of 220 kpc and pericenter of 25 kpc ( run l24 , see table 2 ) in this `` minimal halo '' .",
    "the apocenter of this orbit is still sufficiently large to be consistent with the distance of the second most distant dsph satellite , leo ii ( @xmath254 kpc ) . due to the truncation of the potential",
    "the orbital time is larger than for orbits with similar parameters in the standard potential ( @xmath45 gyr instead of @xmath48 gyr ) and thus the satellite performs only one pericenter passage in 7 gyr .",
    "the lower number of shocks as well as the longer time spent by the dwarf far from any significant influence of the tidal field produce a remnant with a still recognizable disk structure and @xmath255 , larger than that of any dsph . in figure 28",
    "we see the evolution of @xmath1 for this run ( l24 ) and also a comparison with run l17 ( see table 2 ) , the latter corresponding to an orbit with similar apocenter and lower eccentricity placed in the standard halo model . in figure 28",
    "we can also see that the circular velocity profile evolves much less than in the case of lsb satellites in the standard primary halo ( figure 6 ) , indicating that stripping is comparatively modest .",
    "these results strengthen the point made in the last section , namely that the orbital time is the key parameter determining the transformation .",
    "moreover , they highlight that primary halos as massive and extended as those formed in cdm cosmogonies are required to explain the origin of _ all _ lg dsphs , out to the distances of leo i and leo ii , with tidal stirring .",
    "= 8truecm    the plunging orbits chosen in many of our simulations penetrate quite close to the center of the primary halo , at 30 - 40 kpc .",
    "the milky way and m31 have disks that extend at least out to 15 - 20 kpc .",
    "however , their mass is expected to be small compared to that of their halos , even if they do not have @xmath206 ratios as high as those of dwarf galaxies ( persic & salucci 1997 ) . in order to test the validity of our results when a central disk component is added to the primaty",
    ", we placed an lsb satellite ( the most sensible to variations in the tidal forces ) on a orbit with pericenter of 40 kpc in the usual isothermal halo and we added to the latter a disk with a structure similar to that of the milky way ( i.e. with a mass @xmath256 and scale length of 3 kpc ) .",
    "the disk was modeled using a miyamoto - nagai potential    @xmath257    where @xmath258 is the disk radius in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath187 is the scale length ( @xmath259 kpc ) and @xmath188 is the scale height .",
    "we set @xmath260 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . comparing the results obtained in this run ( l25 ) with an analogous run in the standard primary potential ( l13 ) we see only marginal differences : as illustrated in figure 29 , the mass of the remnant after 6 gyr is very similar , although the addition of the a central disk component to the primary halo slightly enhances stripping .",
    "we thus conclude that the tidal shock is always dominated by the halo , even for quite small pericenter distances .",
    "from the evolution of the gas surface density observed in the gasdynamical runs ( section 4.2 ) we can calculate the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the dwarfs using the kennicutt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this is a phenomenological law , calibrated using large samples of disk galaxies , from dwarf irregulars to large spiral galaxies , and relates the _ specific _ star formation rate @xmath261 ( measured in @xmath262 yr@xmath77 kpc@xmath8 ) to the gas surface density @xmath263 . at a given location in a galaxy",
    "we have :    @xmath264    where @xmath265 is the dynamical time of the gas .",
    "the efficiency @xmath53 is @xmath266 for the best fit indicated by kennicutt ( 1998 ) using a large dataset , although such data show a large scatter , especially for faint galaxies : for non - starburst dwarf galaxies , with sfrs @xmath267 yr@xmath77 , @xmath53 ranges between 0.01 and 1 .",
    "we calibrate @xmath53 for our model galaxies by requiring that the satellites , from their formation until the time they enter into the milky way halo , have a constant star formation rate high enough to produce the stellar mass of our initial models ( models lmg2 and hmg2 , see table 1 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath53 may vary depending on their formation epoch .",
    "we consider two formation epochs for the dwarfs , either 12 or 15 gyr ago , as the age of the oldest stars in dsphs falls within that range ( grebel 1999 , hernandz et al .",
    "2000 ) , while we always assume that they entered into the milky way halo 10 gyr ago .",
    "the sfrs and related parameters are reported in the caption of figure 30 . with this procedure ,",
    "the specific sfrs for lsb satellites turn out to be of the same order of those recently derived for local dirrs like sextans a and gr8 using hst photometry ( dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) and are pretty close to those derived for isolated lsb galaxies using n - body / sph simulations ( gerritsen & de blok 1999 ) .",
    "lsbs require high values of @xmath53 because of the low surface density of their disks : instead , for hsbs the efficiencies are closer to the `` best fit '' given by kennicutt ( 1998 ) , which is not surprising since the galaxies in that sample are mostly normal , high - surface brightness disks .",
    "= 8truecm = 8truecm    from the time at which we start the simulations up to the final time , we compute , for each output , the specific sfr as a function of radius calculating the values of @xmath263 and @xmath265 in equally spaced radial bins ( in calculating @xmath268 we always take into account the gas mass that has already being consumed at the previous output in a given bin ) .",
    "we then calculate the average sfr in the dwarf integrating over its area ( only out to @xmath269 because the gas is rapidly stripped at larger radii ) and weighting by the gas mass in each bin .",
    "the resulting star formation histories are shown in figure 30 . in the case of the lsb the star formation rate has a periodic behavior , with peaks of activity quite well correlated to each pericenter passage .",
    "the exact number and height of the peaks depends on the efficiency parameter @xmath53 : when this is high , the gas is mainly consumed in the first two bursts and there is only a small amount left when the satellite approaches the primary for the third time .",
    "the small starbursts are separated by a timescale of @xmath270 gyr , roughly the orbital time of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "qualitatively , these star formation histories bear a striking resemblance to those recently derived for leo i and carina by hernandez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using hst color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "do they also correspond quantitatively ? if we integrate the specific sfrs at the peaks obtained for the lsb over the areas of carina and leo i ( using directly the size of the lsb remnant would be misleading as this corresponds more to an extended dsph like sextans ) , for a tidal radius of @xmath116 750 pc ( see mateo 1998 ) , we obtain , for @xmath271 , a sfr between 150 and 350 @xmath262/myr , pretty close to the values of 150 - 200 @xmath262/myr estimated by hernandz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . instead , for a higher star formation efficiency the maximum sfrs are sensibly higher than the observational estimate .",
    "in the case of the hsb satellite , only one , very stronger burst occurs after first pericentric passage , depleting all the gas in less than @xmath220 gyr , before the satellite completes the second orbit . because gas consumption is always extremely fast compared to the orbital time",
    ", the results do not depend sensitively on the efficiency parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the maximum star formation rate is almost a factor of 10 higher than in the case of the lsb .",
    "this second type of star formation history is present also among observed early type dwarfs : draco and ursa minor are well known examples and even m31 s des appear to have had one major episode of star formation ( grebel 1998 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "supernovae feedback , which is not included in the derived star formation histories , could have a significant effect , especially in the case of hsbs , given their strong burst .",
    "their star formation rate during the burst is of the order of that measured in the dwarf galaxies analyzed by martin ( 1999 ) , which all show strong outflows of gas ( even an lg dirr , sextans a , is included in such a sample sample ) .",
    "mass loss rates of about @xmath272/yr are thought to be associated with the prominent h@xmath53 shells observed .",
    "the velocity of the inflow of gas associated with the bar is of the order of @xmath273 km / s , while the expanding shell produced by supernovae explosions ( which would occur almost instantly compared to the dynamical time of the galaxy ) would be moving at up to 100 km / s ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 ) and could in principle reverse the motion of the gas .",
    "however , maclaw & ferrara ( 1999 ) , using a high - resolution eulerian code to model the ism in a star - bursting dwarf within a massive dark matter halo , have shown that , unless the dwarf has a total mass as low as @xmath274 , the gas mass lost during these outflows is only a few percent of the total mass even for starbursts as intense as @xmath275 erg / s ( comparable to the intensity calculated for the hsb satellite ) .",
    "the holes produced in the gaseous disk recollapse under the influence of the gravity of the galaxy and will settle down again @xmath276 yr after the explosion , switching on again star formation .",
    "we can imagine these process repeating several times as new supernovae explosions occur . as a result",
    ", the same gas mass will be turned into stars on a longer time scale than in our model : we should still see a first peak of activity , but this will be lower , being soon depressed by the first consistent supernovae explosion , and will be then followed by a less intense , extended activity regulated more by feedback than by the bar inflow .",
    "this might explain why in the des , after a first burst , some star formation took place even recently ( grebel 1999 ) .",
    "= 8truecm    we can ask how the sfr history of the gr8-like dwarf would like if we added gas .",
    "the disk stellar surface density of gr8 is pretty close to that of the hsbs and this would be likely true even for the gaseous disk . therefore , the specific sfr would be necessarily close to that of hsbs .",
    "a clear bar pattern appears after the second pericenter passage and would likely produce a strong burst .",
    "the star formation in draco and ursa minor seems to have lasted @xmath48 gyr according to hernandz et al .",

    "would actually match the observations better , lowering the intensity of the burst ( those derived by hernandz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for draco and ursa minor are substantially weaker ) while still drastically reducing the star formation immediately after it .",
    "in section 4 we have seen that , while remnants of hsbs have little scatter in their structural properties , remnants of lsbs have a large scatter , being very sensible to the orbital configuration .",
    "on orbit with large pericenters , for example , the bar instability is stronger because stripping is less efficient : in this case a star formation history closer to that of hsbs may result .",
    "therefore , a strong prediction of our model is that dsphs must have a large variety of star formation histories , while des should have very similar histories .",
    "the data seems to support this conclusion ( grebel 1999 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "= 5truecm    from the final density profiles of the gas ( figure 13 ) we can argue that a compact stellar nucleus would form in the remnants of hsbs . a crude conversion of the gas surface density directly into stellar surface density implies that the central surface brightness should be boosted by @xmath220 magnitudes inside a scale of 500 pc assuming the same @xmath277 of the pre - existing stellar component ( this is a conservative choice shortly after the burst has started because the blue luminosity would be higher at that time ) .",
    "such a central luminosity spike would probably resemble that associated to the blue nucleus in ngc205 ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "the fraction of the newly formed stellar population with respect to the total stellar mass would be @xmath278 in both the lsbs and hsbs , similar to the initial gas fraction .",
    "this is not surprising because gas and pre - existing stars are stripped to the same extent and most of the gas that remains bound is transformed into stars .",
    "however , this means also that if the initial gas / stars ratio in the models were @xmath279 , as in some dirrs ( e.g. sagdig in the lg ) , the satellite could in principle form most of its stars during the interaction .    due to the bar driven inflow , young stars in the remnant would be principally located in its central part .",
    "this is what is observed in many lg early type dwarfs , with fornax , carina , sextans and ngc147 being well known examples ( grebel 1999 ) .",
    "the much stronger bursts in hsb satellites should give rise to a higher metal enrichment compared to lsb satellites because the supernovae rate should be higher .",
    "as tidal stirring necessarily implies that the remnants of the robust hsbs are more luminous than the remnants of the fragile lsbs , one would expect a correlation between metallicity and luminosity , similar to that observed in the lg , where bright des are more metal - rich than dsphs ( mateo 1998 ) . on the other end",
    ", a higher metallicity spread should be present in dsphs as a consequence of their star formation being more extended in time .",
    "radial metallicity gradients , with the more metal rich population sitting in the center of the galaxy , as observed in fornax ( grebel 1999 ) , are also a natural consequence of the present model .",
    "figure 31 shows the final cumulative profile of the cold gas component in the tidally stirred dwarfs once consumption by star formation is taken into account .",
    "only the results for the lsb are shown as all the gas is consumed in the hsb , notwithstanding the chosen efficiency .",
    "the final @xmath280 in the lsb remnant is @xmath281 for @xmath271 and @xmath282 for @xmath283 .",
    "the limits derived for the lsb remnant for the lower value of @xmath53 , which yields star formation rates closer to those observed for dsphs , are slightly higher than the limits inferred for @xmath284 in dsphs ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "however , our simulations lack heating sources , like supernovae , that could have ionized or even blown out some of the remaining gas .",
    "= 8truecm    the final distribution of the unbound gas yields some interesting predictions . leading and trailing streams of gas form that parallel the stellar streams .",
    "these keep following the satellite s trajectory in the primary potential for all the duration of the simulations ( more than 7 gyr ) . in the case of the lsb satellite",
    "the gaseous streams comprise more than 60 % of the total initial gas mass .",
    "such extra - tidal gas is never reaccreted by the dwarf galaxy , contrary to recent claims ( lin & murray 2000 ) : particles that end up in the remnant have always been inside the final tidal radius , as was verified by tracing back into time the position of the particles . however , the streams tend to clump at apocenter , where the orbital velocity is low , and chance alignments along the line of sight are possible , like in the case of the stellar streams ( section 5.4 ) . when viewed from within the orbital plane , the streams _ projected onto the plane of the sky",
    "_ could look like two gas clouds symmetrically distributed around the bound stellar component ( figure 32 ) .",
    "the resulting configuration is very reminiscent of that of the outer hi distribution in sculptor ( carignan et al .",
    "in addition , similar sistemic velocities would be measured for the galaxy and the clouds , as these are moving on the same orbit : these results could explain the origin of the outer gas component recently discovered around several lg dsphs ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ) .",
    "using stellar population synthesis models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) we calculated the evolution of the luminosity and of the stellar mass - to - light ratio of the remnants according to the derived star formation histories .",
    "we adopt synthesis models for stellar populations with a metallicity of @xmath285 the solar value .",
    "gerritsen & de blok ( 1999 ) find such low values for the metallicity of lsb galaxies and dsphs in the local group have even lower metallicities in their older stellar populations ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "given a star formation rate @xmath286 , the evolution of the total luminosity @xmath287 of the galaxy in the b band is given by :    @xmath288    where @xmath289 is the luminosity contributed by stars of age @xmath290 .",
    "we simply assume @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is the constant sfr prior to the first pericenter passage , equal to @xmath272 yr@xmath77 , and @xmath293 a exp@xmath294 represent the bursts ( @xmath295=0 for the hsb ) .",
    "the time and normalization constants of the bursts are derived by naively fitting the star formation histories obtained for the highest value of @xmath53 ( see previous section ) in order to evaluate an upper limit for the final luminosity .    in figure 33",
    "we can see the resulting evolution of the b band stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath277 , for both the lsb and the hsb .",
    "the final @xmath277 are @xmath45 in both cases after 7 - 8 gyr ( the earlier truncation of the star formation in the hsb is compensated by the much stronger burst ) decreasing by more than a factor of 2 with respect to their initial value",
    ".    we can now use such information to compute the luminosities of the remnants from @xmath277 and their final stellar masses .",
    "being conservative , we consider the value of @xmath277 reached after 7 gyr , which is equal to 5 , except in the case of gr8 , where we consider the value reached after 10 gyr , @xmath296 , since in our scenario we assumed a much earlier infall time for the latter , corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "the surface brightness can be obtained as well : the resulting profiles were actually shown in section 5 . in section 5.3",
    "we gave lower limits on the final value of @xmath219 .",
    "we can now compute more precisely the final @xmath219 by multiplying the obtained @xmath277 times the ratio @xmath206 found in the remnants .",
    "the resulting @xmath219 are in the range 6 - 30 , except for the remnant of gr8 , that would have @xmath297 ( @xmath206 is @xmath298 ) , matching well the values inferred for draco and ursa minor .",
    "= 8truecm    as shown in mayer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , it is possible to construct the fundamental plane for the remnants coupling the information directly provided by the simulations with the model for the photometric evolution described in this section .",
    "such fundamental plane reproduces well that of observed early - type dwarfs ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "here we show the correlation between luminosity and surface brightness , the @xmath299 relation ( figure 34 ) , which also matches well the observations ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "the range of surface brightness and luminosity spanned by the remnants of lsbs and hsbs corresponds to that spanned by , respectively , dsphs and des ( see mateo 1998 ) .",
    "we have shown that disk - like dwarf galaxies resembling nearby dirrs can be transformed into dsphs and des as a result of 2 - 3 strong tidal shocks at the pericenters of their orbits within the primary halo .",
    "our model naturally leads to the morphology - density relation observed in the local group ; present - day lg dirrs , being close to the boundary of the lg zero velocity surface ( van den bergh 1999 ) , have just decoupled from the hubble flow and have not yet suffered any tidal forcing by the primary galaxies , while dsphs are the descendants of dwarf disk galaxies that crossed the boundary of the primary halos several gyr ago .",
    "the transformation results from a combination of mass loss by tidal stripping plus removal of angular momentum and vertical heating due tidally induced dynamical instabilities .",
    "the different impact of mass stripping and of triggered instabilities in hsb dirrs versus lsb dirrs naturally explains the different structural properties of des versus dsphs .",
    "the fact that , at least in the local group , the number of des is lower compared to that of dsphs ( only 3 around m31 against nearly 20 dsphs in the whole lg ) can be understood in terms of the skewness of the number density of disk galaxies towards lower surface brightness , especially at low luminosities ( sprayberry et al .",
    "1997 ; bothun 1997 ; oneil & bothun 2000 ) .",
    "photometric surveys of other nearby groups will be useful to ascertain if the relative proportion of dsphs versus des is a general trend among faint dwarf satellites . according to our model",
    "this can be explained with a prevalence of objects with shallow halo profiles ( namely lsb dirrs ) among the progenitors of early - type dwarfs .",
    "this might have an impact on our understanding of structure formation .",
    "in fact , in cdm cosmogonies the average central density of halos on the mass scale of dwarfs is higher than that assumed in lsb models ( the gr8 model being a notable exception ) , the latter being closer to the typical central density of small halos in wdm models ( bode et al .",
    "2000 ; eke et al .",
    "2000 ) .    on the other end , the origin of the extremely dark matter dominated dsphs , draco and ursa minor , is well explained assuming a cdm scenario .",
    "in fact , in the latter model one expects that the dwarf satellites forming at high redshift have a typical central dark matter density as high as that of the faint dirr gr8 .",
    "these small galaxies are very robust to tides , but if they fall at @xmath300 into the primary halo their orbital times are so small that they can double the number of pericenter passages relative to the satellites infalling at @xmath301 .",
    "by @xmath75 they transmute into tiny spheroidal galaxies but maintain very high dark matter contents , just like draco and ursa minor ; one can actually use such high density dwarfs to place a lower limit on the mass of the dark matter particle in wdm models ( dalcanton & hogan 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown that _",
    "tidal stirring _ is effective if satellites have sufficiently low orbital times , notwithstanding the moderate eccentricities of their orbits .",
    "lsb satellites on circular orbits very close to the milky way can even disrupt due to their large , low density disks and will produce long - lasting density enhancements that resemble the dwarf spheroidal sagittarius .",
    "however , the farthest dsphs , leo i and leo ii , must be moving on fairly eccentric orbits ( apo / peri @xmath302 ) in order to be transformed .",
    "these distant dwarfs place also a constraint on the structure of the primary halo , which must be as large and massive as expected in hierarchical models for them to have sufficiently small orbital times .",
    "our evolutionary mechanism is able to explain the difference in gas content between dwarf spheroidals and dwarf irregulars as well as the recent observations of extra - tidal gas around some lg dsphs .",
    "in addition , we obtained both periodic star formation histories and single - burst star formation histories for , respectively , lsb and hsb satellites , reproducing the variety observed among lg early - type dwarfs . with tidal stirring operating in a hierarchical structure formation scenario",
    ", we expect dsphs closer to the primary galaxies to have stars typically older then those in more distant ones because they should have , on average , an earlier infall time and thus an earlier bursting phase : van den bergh ( 1994 ) has pointed out that there are indications of such a correlation among lg dsphs .",
    "van den bergh ( 2000 ) and grebel ( 1999 ) have recently noted that some peripheral globular clusters in lg dsphs ( e.g. fornax ) are younger ( less than 10 gyr ) than globular clusters in the outer halo of the galaxy . in our scenario",
    "they could have formed in the strongest phase of the tidal shock , immediately following pericenter passage , but in this case we would expect to find them quite close to the center : subsequently , dynamical friction can only take them even closer to the center , apparently leading to a conflict with observations .",
    "however , oh , lin & richer ( 2000 ) have found that tidal mass loss provoked by the primary galaxy would cause a diffusion of the clusters orbits towards the outer regions as they preserve their radial and azimuthal actions during the gradual decline of the potential of the dwarf .",
    "therefore , we can argue that tidal stirring might provide a mechanism that explains , at the same time , the formation of globular clusters in dsphs and their present spatial distribution .",
    "the stars stripped in both the hsb and lsb should be prevalently old ( with an age @xmath303 gyr ) , as we know that the new star formation takes place in the inner , bound regions of the satellite . as a result",
    ", we expect the outer stellar halo of the milky way to be abundant in old , low metallicity stars .",
    "if , as suggested by the results of the lsb runs , we assume that carina , fornax , leo i , leo ii , sculptor , sextans and sagittarius have typically lost @xmath304 of their original stellar mass , we find out that dwarf spheroidals should have contributed at least @xmath305 solar masses to the old stellar halo",
    ". these should be still recognizable as part of distinct streams tracing the orbits of the satellites , with a maximum surface brightness ( at the turning points of the orbits ) of just 30 mag arcsec@xmath8 ( in the b band ) .",
    "spectroscopic evidence for stellar streams from the dsph carina has been claimed ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ) and the northern stream of sagittarius or a new stream associated to another disrupted nearby dwarf has recently been observed ( martinz - delgado et al .",
    "future astrometric missions , like sim and gaia ( gilmore et al .",
    "1998 ; helmi et al .",
    "2000 ) should reveal such faint features and will also carry out high - quality measurements of proper motions for many satellites of the milky way , thus providing a test for the orbital configurations used in this model .",
    "stellar streams projected on the plane of the sky close to the line of sight can produce subtle observational effects in the case of fragile lsb satellites , thereby inflating the measured velocity dispersions .",
    "their signature should be an apparent rotation of the dwarf and could have been observed in ursa minor ( hargreaves et al .",
    "1994a ) . instead",
    ", velocity dispersion anisotropy can not inflate significantly the measures of the mass - to - light ratios .    from the evolution of the stellar mass - to - light ratio",
    ", it turns out that hsb satellites have @xmath277 as low as @xmath199 during the bursting phase : the high blue luminosity would originate mainly from the central part of the galaxies , which could thus resemble the blue compact dwarfs(bcds ) observed by guzmn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at intermediate redshift ( @xmath306 ) .",
    "the velocity widths of these galaxies correspond to those of the largest among our hsb satellites ( between 50 and 75 km / s ) and the total blue luminosities would also be comparable ( model hm1 reaches a luminosity of about @xmath307 in this phase ) .",
    "interestingly , guzmn et al . (",
    "1997 ) conclude that fading would transform bcds into objects similar to ngc205 and the other des after several gyr and that none of them could fade so much as to resemble dsphs .",
    "the latter conclusion is very reminiscent of our claim that hsb dirrs are the progenitors of des and not of the faint dsphs .",
    "future investigations aimed at searching for massive galaxies in the vicinity of blue compact dwarfs may shed light on the connection with tidally stirred dwarfs .",
