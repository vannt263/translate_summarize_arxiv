    "because of the advances in nanotechnology it has become possible to use very small structures in a broad range of applications .",
    "the importance of these applications and the fact that the physical properties of such structures could be very different from those of bulk materials , make the theoretical and experimental investigations very useful in this area .",
    "the experimental findings in @xcite motivated us to calculate the thermal properties of ultrathin dielectric membranes or wires by splitting the phonon spectra into discrete and a continuous parts @xcite .",
    "this framework implies crossovers between different phonon gas distributions , reflected , for example , in the exponent of the temperature dependence of the specific heat or heat conductivity .",
    "for example in a membrane , as the temperature drops , the population of the phonon modes parallel to the surfaces [ which we shall call the two - dimensional ground state ( 2d gs ) ] becomes dominant , and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) phonon gas distribution changes into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) one @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic population of the 2d gs [ or one - dimensional ground state ( 1d gs ) in the case of a wire @xcite ] and the qualitative differences between phonon gas distributions with various dimensions enabled us to make the analogy with the multiple - step bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite and to call this phenomenon bose - like condensation ( blc ) . yet",
    ", the number of phonons changes with temperature and features like maxima of the specific heat ( @xmath5 ) observed in the case of bec can not be seen in the case of a phonon gas undergoing blc .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to extend the previous work reported in refs . @xcite and to describe blc in systems of massive bosons and fermions .",
    "this will be done in section [ blc ] .",
    "the mathematical technique used here is a straightforward extension of the one introduced by pathria and greenspoon in ref .",
    ". nevertheless , the analytical approximations used there are not appropriate for our case .",
    "therefore , after obtaining general expressions , we make numerical calculations to give concrete examples of blc and to observe the behavior of the specific heat during the transition .",
    "the phenomenon occurs at low particle densities ( this will be made more clear in section [ blc ] ) and is specific to both bosons and fermions . at low temperatures ,",
    "the number of massive particles in a closed system can be considered to be constant .",
    "the conservation of the particle number will allow us to observe resemblances with the bec , like , in some cases , maxima of the specific heat ( @xmath6 ) at the condensation temperature .",
    "anyway , the signature of blc , as seen in the temperature dependence of @xmath5 , is more complex and depends on the energy spectrum .",
    "a consequence of the third law of thermodynamics is that the specific heat of any thermodynamical system should vanish at zero temperature .",
    ". showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the heat capacity of a fermi gas , confined in an external potential of quite general form , and for any space dimension , has the asymptotic behavior @xmath7 at low temperatures ( where @xmath8 is the temperature of the system ) .",
    "this is for the case of a continuous energy spectrum .",
    "in contrast to this we show in section [ diverg ] that the specific heat of a fermi gas with a single - particle hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 , with @xmath10 having a ( quasi)continuous spectrum @xmath11 and @xmath12 having the discrete eigenvalues @xmath13 , @xmath14 , may approach , depending on the density of the energy levels of @xmath10 , divergent behavior at temperature @xmath4 k as the fermi energy @xmath0 converges to @xmath13 , for any @xmath15 .",
    "in such a case , if the spectrum of @xmath10 is continuous , then the specific heat diverges at @xmath4 and @xmath2 , for any @xmath15 .",
    "however , in any finite system the energy spectrum is discrete , so the specific heat approaches zero if we go at low enough temperatures and the third law of thermodynamics is not violated .",
    "ultrathin ( semi)conducting membranes and wires , nowadays widely used in mesoscopic applications , atoms in very anisotropic harmonic traps , wires or constrictions defined in 2d electronic gasses are just a few examples of systems where the phenomena presented here could be observed .",
    "also , they could provide an understanding of the behavior of very thin liquid he films .",
    "the bec in cuboidal boxes with small dimensions drew a lot of attention many years ago , in the beginning in connection with very thin films of liquid he @xcite .",
    "it is now well known that , as the dimensions of the box are reduced , at constant density , the cusp - like maximum of @xmath5 is rounded off and the condensation temperature ( in this situation taken as the temperature corresponding to the maximum ) increases with respect of the bulk value .",
    "the maximum of the specific heat is usually smaller in restricted geometries than in the bulk , for all the boundary conditions imposed on the walls of the container , with the exception ( the only one known by the present author ) of dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical investigation of bec in harmonic traps ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) was motivated recently by its realization in ultracold trapped atomic gases @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the specific heat of an infinite system presents a discontinuity at the condensation temperature . in finite systems ,",
    "the discontinuity is again rounded off , as shown by analytical and numerical calculations , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite . as the number of particles",
    "is decreased the condensation temperature decreases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the multiple - step bec was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite for the cases of very anisotropic boxes or confining potentials",
    ". in this case a finite bose gas is condensing gradually to the ground state , exhibiting in between 2d and/or 1d macroscopic populations .    in a very anisotropic bose system , as particle density decreases , the multiple - step bec ( msbec ) temperature becomes lower than the temperature at which some of the degrees of freedom of our system freeze out . during both processes ( msbec and freezing )",
    "the 3d particle distribution transforms gradually into a lower dimensional distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the two processes change into each other at the variation of the particle density or of the dimensions of the system .",
    "moreover , the reduction of the dimensionality of the particle distribution due to the freezing out of some of the degrees of freedom can happen also for fermions at low densities .",
    "the analogies and differences between the two processes mentioned above , justify ( arguably , of course ) the use of the simpler expression of bose - like condensation for the freesing out of degrees of freedom , in the limit of low particle density .",
    "the temperature at which blc occurs ( as in the case of bec in finite systems , this temperature can not be uniquely defined ) depends on the energy spectrum and has a finite positive value .",
    "this type of condensation is identical for both bosons and fermions ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . to show this , let us consider a closed system of massive bosons and fermions described by a single - particle hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 , with the eigenvalues @xmath16 , as explained in the introduction .",
    "the mean occupation numbers of single particle energy levels @xmath17 , are @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the superscript for bosons , and @xmath20 for fermions , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the chemical potential .",

    "then , for example , the number of particles , the internal energy , and the heat capacity can be written as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively ( in all this paper we shall consider spinless particles ) . to avoid divergent terms that occur in the functions introduced when @xmath8 approaches zero , in the case when the ground state energy @xmath27 is positive , we redefine @xmath28 as @xmath29 and @xmath17 as @xmath30 . making these replacements we do not change the thermodynamics of the canonical ensemble @xcite .",

    "<S> the phenomenon of bose - like condensation , the continuous change of the dimensionality of the particle distribution as a consequence of freezing out of one or more degrees of freedom in the limit of low particle density , is investigated theoretically in the case of closed systems of massive bosons and fermions , described by general single - particle hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is similar for both types of particles and , for some energy spectra , exhibits features specific to multiple - step bose - einstein condensation , for instance the appearance of maxima in the specific heat . in the case of fermions , as the particle density increases , another phenomenon is also observed . for certain types of single particle hamiltonians , </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat is approaching asymptotically a divergent behavior at zero temperature , as the fermi energy @xmath0 is converging towards any value from an infinite discrete set of energies : @xmath1 . if @xmath2 , for any @xmath3 , the specific heat is divergent at @xmath4 just in infinite systems , whereas for any finite system the specific heat approaches zero at low enough temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the results are particularized for particles trapped inside parallelepipedic boxes and harmonic potentials . </S>",
