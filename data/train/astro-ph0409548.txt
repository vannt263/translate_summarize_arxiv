    "the study of star clusters provides important clues to the formation and enrichment history of the milky way galaxy . to the extent that we can consider the different stars in a given cluster to have a common distance , age , chemical content , and foreground extinction they provide stronger constraints on models of stellar evolution than field stars , whose distances , reddenings , and metallicities",
    "must be estimated on an individual basis . while studies of field stars can provide important insights into extremes of the local stellar population ( the oldest , the most metal - rich , the most metal - poor stars ; , sandage , lubin & vandenberg 2003 ) , in the middle of the hertzsprung - russell diagram there is such a congestion of stars with a range of ages , metallicities , and evolutionary states that extremely high accuracy _ and _ precision in estimates of effective temperature , metal abundance , and distance are required to derive a reliable age estimate for any given isolated star .",
    "the study of star clusters relaxes the need for extreme accuracy and precision , at least to some extent .",
    "spectroscopic abundance determinations can be derived for a number of different stars in the same cluster , and the average of those determinations can be applied to the cluster as a whole with a precision that is probably higher than possible for any single star .",
    "more important , the presence within a cluster of stars of different masses allows us to estimate a common cluster age and distance by forcing consistency with a given set of theoretical isochrones over a range of luminosities and temperatures , and hence of evolutionary states .",
    "at least to the extent that relative ages among different clusters can be estimated from the _ shapes _ of ther principal squences ( , anthony - twarog & twarog 1985 ; vandenberg , bolte & stetson 1990 ; sarajedini & demarque 1990 ; stetson , bruntt & grundahl 2003 ) , uncertainties in distance and reddening become less critical .    ever since it was first noted that the open cluster was likely to be very old ( van  den  bergh 1958 appears to be the first published mention , although sandage 1962 has noted that ivan king apparently recognized the particular interest of this cluster in 1948 ) , it has been the subject of numerous photometric and astrometric studies .",
    "photometric observations that have made significant contributions to our understanding of were reported by sandage , sharov ( 1965 ) , cannon ( 1968 ) , eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) , mcclure & twarog ( 1977 ) , caputo  ( 1990 ) , dinescu  ( 1996 ) , von  hippel & sarajedini ( 1998 ) , sarajedini  ( 1999 ) , and platais  ( 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , kaluzny & shara ( 1987 ) ; zhang  ( 2002 ) ; and kafka & honeycutt ( 2003 ) have published photometric studies of variable stars in the cluster field .",
    "finally , cannon ; upgren , mesrobian & kerridge ( 1972 ) ; dinescu ; and platais  have published membership probabilities for stars in the field based upon measurements of their proper motions .    in the present paper we present newly derived photometric indices for stars in from ccd images which we have either obtained ourselves , received from colleagues , or recovered from public - domain archives .",
    "these photometric results are compared and then combined on a star - by - star basis with photometric data from previous studies of the cluster .",
    "we also merge the results of previous astrometric studies of the cluster and combine them with the photometric information to provide color - magnitude and color - color diagrams of probable cluster members.67 , , and to the old field stars of the solar neighborhood . ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , has been the subject of numerous previous photometric studies .",
    "table  1 presents an in - a - glance summary of the properties of the previous and present photometric studies of the cluster . here and henceforth in this paper , when discussing a particular photometric dataset ( as opposed to a paper )",
    "we will save space by labeling that dataset with the name of the first author of the publication only , with terse modifiers when needed .",
    "for each dataset which we consider distinct ( column 1 of the table ) , we list the technology used to acquire the data ( column 2 ) , the number of stars for which photometric data are presented ( column 3 ) , the limiting magnitudes in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( columns 4 through 7 ) , and the source of the data which were employed to calibrate the photometry of the given study ( column 8) . here , we define `` limiting magnitude '' simply as the 95@xmath7 percentile of the magnitudes listed in the dataset ; this is intended purely as a crude indicator of the greatest depth effectively probed , and we make no claims concerning the completeness of any sample . we have not listed the limiting magnitude in @xmath8 , but each of the two studies that provides @xmath6 magnitudes also gives @xmath8 magnitudes to a corresponding magnitude limit",
    ". the upgren study is included in this table for completeness , but most of the photometry presented in that paper was not original with them ; rather they tabulated a compilation of previous values taken from the literature , with magnitudes estimated from their plates only when data from other sources were not available .",
    "we were unable to locate copies of the original von  hippel & sarajedini data tables .",
    "this study is therefore not included in the analysis which follows .",
    "we obtained 86 ccd images of with the f/5 newtonian camera on the plaskett 1.8 m telescope of the dominion astrophysical observatory on the nights of 1996 july 11 and 12 ( ut ) .",
    "the ccd camera covered a field 93 square with a sampling of 055 per pixel .",
    "we took 28 images in the @xmath4 photometric bandpass , 33 in @xmath5 , and 25 in @xmath8 divided among three separate subfields , and exposure times ranged from 6@xmath2s to 900@xmath2s .",
    "conditions were judged to be non - photometric when these observations were made . during the same nights observations",
    "were obtained for eight different equatorial standard fields from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , we acquired from the dao archive copies of images obtained by manuela  zoccali using the same equipment on the nights of july 15 and 16 ; she had observed secondary standard fields in the globular cluster m92 and the old open cluster ( see stetson 2000 and stetson  2003 ) . because all these data were obtained under non - photometric conditions , we are not able to fully calibrate them to a fundamental magnitude system on the basis of internal information alone .",
    "however , we can exploit the fact that stars of differing colors were imaged on the detector simultaneously to determine the color - dependent terms in the transformation equations from the instrumental to the standard magnitude system . later on we will use the results of previous photometric studies of the cluster to determine the calibration zero - point for each of the individual images .",
    "howard  bond has given us copies of his images from 13 different observing runs at the kitt peak 4 m and 0.9 m and the cerro tololo 0.9 m telescopes . among the kitt peak 0.9",
    "m data were 12 images of ngc188four in each of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 filters  obtained on 1996 september 21 .",
    "we also searched the available public archives for other images of and found 201 of them : 6 exposures with the four - chip isaac newton telescope wide - field camera ( 24 images in total ) , and a further 177 images obtained with single - ccd cameras from three different observing runs on the int .",
    "of these data , only two observing runs were judged to be photometric on the basis of standard - star calibration residuals , a point which we will discuss in greater detail below .",
    "we requested from the ing archive all images  both scientific and calibration  from those observing runs when was observed , and derived and applied the bias and flat - field corrections in the usual way .",
    "this was also done for the plaskett data , of course , but howard bond had provided us his images in already - rectified form .",
    "the daophot , allstar , daomatch , daomaster , and allframe software packages ( stetson 1987 , 1993 , 1994 ) were used to detect and measure the positions and brightnesses of astronomical sources in all 299 of the ccd images that were available to us .",
    "the star - subtracted images were stacked and examined by eye to designate stars which had been missed by the automatic routines , and the allframe reductions were repeated until we judged that everything that we could see had been reduced .",
    "the images were then subjected to a routine growth - curve analysis to determine corrections from the profile - fitting magnitudes to a system of aperture magnitudes in a large synthetic aperture ( stetson 1990 ) , and calibration equations relating the instrumental - system magnitudes to the standard system of landolt were derived .",
    "full transformations , complete with zero - points and extinction coefficients as well as linear and quadratic color terms , were possible only for the two int observing runs where apparently photometric conditions prevailed .",
    "for the remaining data it was possible to determine only the color terms of the transformation equations .      in order to compile a master star list for the region of , we supplemented our own ccd images with ten other star lists from the archives and literature .",
    "( 1 ) we extracted from the u.  s.  naval observatory `` usno - a2.0 '' guide - star catalog ( monet  1998 ) all 9,503 sources within a square box 660 on a side centered on coordinates @xmath9472752 , @xmath1016107 ( j2000 ) .",
    "( 2)(5 ) employing the services of the canadian astronomy data centre , we extracted images 54on a side , centered on the same coordinates , from the digital sky survey  1 `` o '' plate , and the digital sky survey  2 `` b , '' `` r , '' , and `` i '' plates .",
    "these were analyzed with a modernized version of the stetson ( 1979 ) software .",
    "( 6 )  cannon , ( 7 )  upgren , ( 8)  dinescu ( 9 )  sarajedini  ( private communication ) , and ( 10 )  platais  all provided positional determinations along with their photometric indices .",
    "the program daomaster was then used to transform the data from these star lists and our own allframe analysis of the 299 ccd images to a common reference system and numbering scheme .",
    "ten - parameter cubic fits in @xmath11 and @xmath12 were used to effect the transformations .",
    "the usno2 positions were used as the primary reference , so the @xmath13 coordinates in our composite star list should be accurately aligned with the cardinal directions , with @xmath11 increasing east and @xmath12 increasing north .",
    "positions are expressed in units of arcseconds with the origin of the coordinate system at the celestial coordinates given above .",
    "a critical match - up tolerance was gradually decreased from 9 to 4 arcseconds in deciding whether entries in different star lists referred to the same object .",
    "this tolerance was larger than we normally employ , but in this case it was necessary in order to deal with the upgren positions , which were given only to the nearest one - tenth arcminute .",
    "table  2 indicates the number of stars from each sample which were successfully merged into the master list , and the precision of the positions as inferred from the fitting residuals .",
    "it would be unfair to interpret these precision estimates as reflecting the relative astrometric accuracy or precision of the various studies , since different researchers probably adopted different tolerances for the degree of crowding or the limiting signal - to - noise ratio for the detections they chose to tabulate , and the @xmath14 s here will be strongly influenced by the _",
    "worst _ data each study chose to report .",
    "the point here is that when appropriate weighted combinations are formed from the reported positions of objects in the ngc188 field , we can generally expect them to be precise to well under 01 .",
    "calibrating photometry for is unusually difficult .",
    "the cluster lies at a declination of + 85 , which means that it stays at a high airmass ( @xmath151.8 ) from sites in the southern united states and the canary islands , regardless of the time of night or time of year .",
    "this declination also places the cluster just about as far as it can possibly be from the best - established faint photometric standard stars , which are concentrated near the equator and in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we have at hand seven datasets that were obtained under nominally photometric conditions , so they can be used to estimate the zero - point of the magnitude scale in the field of ngc188 : ( 1 )  the photoelectric _ ubv _ photometry of sandage ( 1962 ) ; ( 2 )  the photoelectric photometry attributed to eggen in eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) ; ( 3 )  the photoelectric photometry attributed to sandage in the same paper ; ( 4 )  the ccd photometry of sarajedini  ( 1999 ) , who had one photometric night during which they referred their data to 38 of landolt s ( 1992 )  equatorial standards ; ( 5 )  the ccd photometry of platais ( 2003 ) which , they state , was calibrated by unpublished photometric observations attributed to hainline  ( 2000 ) and employed color terms privately provided by p.  massey  we can only presume that these were based upon landolt and/or johnson standards as are other wiyn open cluster studies ; and ( 6 )  and ( 7 ) , two of the datasets which we obtained through the services of the isaac newton group archive , specifically ones which we designate cmr2 and wkg ( labels based upon the initials of the observer , which are the only personal identifiers available from the image headers ) . of these ,",
    "the former comprised a single night of photometric observations ( 1993 june 24/25 ) from which we were able to obtain 5,673 individual measurements in @xmath5 and 4,678 in @xmath4 of primary and secondary standard stars from stetson s on - line compilation ( see stetson 2000 ) , plus three images in each of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a single 125@xmath16125 field in ngc188 .",
    "the latter consisted of three nights of observations ( 1987 jul 31/aug 1 to aug 2/3 ) providing from 550 to 1,100 standard - star measurements in each filter on each night , plus 139 images of nine distinct 63@xmath1639 ( east - west @xmath16 north - south ) sub - fields in the cluster .",
    "any given sub - field had as few as two observations in each of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or as many as eight observations in each of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 .",
    "( interested readers can recover the placement of these fields on the sky from the stellar positions and cross - identifications that we have posted at our web site , or by querying the ing archive for observations obtained with the int on the dates indicated above . ) for each of these ing datasets , _ ex post facto _ consideration of the standard - star residuals from the photometric calibration solution suggests that conditions were photometric at a level of 0.010.03@xmath2mag per observation .",
    "accordingly , zero - points derived from the cmr2 data alone , for instance , are not likely to be more accurate than @xmath170.010.02 , since in the final analysis they are based on only three observations in each filter , and the photometric errors associated with those observations are not likely to be completely independent .",
    "it is possible that the hainline  observations alluded to by platais  are actually the same as those reported by sarajedini : both were obtained with the kitt peak 0.9 m telescope , and some but not all authors are common to the published abstract and the two refereed papers .",
    "however , platais  state that the hainline  observations span 40  arcminutes on the sky , whereas the sarajedini  data span only about 23  arcminutes . furthermore ,",
    "as we will show below , comparison of the platais and sarajedini magnitudes shows both a small net offset and considerable scatter in the differences .",
    "we therefore assume the two datasets to be statistically independent .",
    "it is also not immediately obvious that datasets ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) are mutually independent . in describing the origins of the data in their table  1 , eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) state that they have tried to `` make the best combination of new 200-inch observations by eggen with the older data by sandage '' by determining and removing systematic differences between the two datasets .",
    "the `` older data by sandage '' would most obviously mean the data from sandage ( 1962 ) . however , there is no obvious one - to - one correspondence between the data from the earlier paper and the observations attributed to sandage in the later one : sandage ( 1962 ) reports photoelectric results for 123 stars , while the observations attributed to sandage in eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) represent only 97 .",
    "there are 28 stars that are in the first paper but not the second , and two stars ( both named `` anon '' ) in the second paper but not the first .",
    "a comparison of the magnitude values for stars in common to the two datasets indicates net offsets of @xmath180.03  in the _ ubv _ magnitude systems which could , of course , be the result of the recalibration undertaken in the 1969 paper .",
    "however , the star - by - star comparison also shows dispersions in the magnitude differences of @xmath180.05  in @xmath3 ( 72 stars in common ) and @xmath180.04  in @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( 95 stars ) between the sandage ( 1962 ) magnitudes and the `` s '' magnitudes of eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) .",
    "it is evident that the latter are not simply the former with an additive calibration correction applied .",
    "furthermore , plots of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( sandage 1962 _ versus _ eggen & sandage 1969 `` s '' ) against  show no clear trend , so we are not dealing with a simultaneous adjustment of zero - point and color transformation .",
    "changes to the extinction correction can not explain the dispersion in the magnitude differences , since lies at a virtually constant airmass , so changes to the extinction coefficients should affect all stars in the field equally .",
    "instead , the two datasets _ seem _ to derive from different observations .",
    "similarly , the eggen & sandage `` e '' stars that are in common with the `` s '' stars in the same table show a net offset of 0.02@xmath2mag in @xmath5 and 0.01@xmath2mag in each of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( 17 stars in _ bv _ and 16 in @xmath3 ) , so it is not obvious that the latter have been placed on the magnitude system of the former by a simple zero - point adjustment .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this paper we will assume that these three datasets , sandage ( 1962 ) and the eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) `` e '' and `` s '' data , are all mutually independent .",
    "under this assumption , then , we have seven mutually independent attempts to establish a fundamental magnitude scale in the field of ngc188 . the three oldest datasets ( sandage , eggen `` e , '' and eggen `` s '' ) were explicitly calibrated to the _ ubv _ system of johnson &  morgan ( 1953 ) and johnson ( 1955 ) ; the fourth and fifth ( sarajedini and platais ) employed the standard photometric system of landolt ( 1992 ) , who did his best to place his _ ubv _ magnitudes on the system of johnson & morgan and johnson ( see landolt 1983 ) ; and for the last two photometric datasets ( cmr2 and wkg ) we employed the standard stars tabulated by stetson ( see stetson 2000 ) , who is doing his best to ensure that his magnitudes are on the same system as landolt s .",
    "therefore , we will further assume that the seven datasets represent independent attempts to establish the _ same _ magnitude scale , and that they differ only as a result of systematic errors which vary at random among the different datasets .    to determine the net study - to - study systematic magnitude offsets in order to define an optimum average system",
    ", we began by using the sarajedini photometry as an initial reference , since that dataset is unique in including measurements in all five of the _ ubvri _ bandpasses .",
    "the top panel of table  3 lists the unweighted arithmetic mean magnitude differences between each of the other six studies and the sarajedini  results in those filters for which data are available .",
    "( the platais study lists the @xmath5 magnitude of star iii-138 as 12.07 . for this star ,",
    "the sandage ( photoelectric ) , eggen `` s '' , mcclure , and our own datasets all give @xmath5 in the range 9.71 to 9.80 .",
    "the platais data for this star are not used here . ) only the platais data , the sarajedini data , and our rereductions of the ing archival data provide a standard - error estimate for each derived standard - system magnitude ; we have used these to reject any measurement with a claimed uncertainty @xmath210.10 , but apart from this no use was made of the standard errors in weighting the magnitude differences .",
    "the three photoelectric datasets from the 1960 s provided no individual error estimates , and all published measurements were retained in the analysis except that it was necessary to manually exclude variable stars v5 = i-11 and v11 = i-116 from these comparisons .",
    "we note from the data in table  3 that the sarajedini  magnitudes are fainter than all six of the other studies in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; the sarajedini magnitudes are also fainter than the one other available study in @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the root - mean - square standard deviation of the magnitude differences in each comparison is provided in the second panel of the table .",
    "some portion of these dispersions is the result of random errors in the individual measurements , but it is likely that there is also some contribution from filter mismatch .",
    "stetson  ( 2003 ) provided evidence that even when measurements of arbitrarily high precision are obtained with a given filter / detector combination , there still tends to be an irreducible scatter of order 0.010.02@xmath2mag when these observations are transformed to a photometric system that is nominally the same , but which was defined with a different filter / detector combination .",
    "( this conclusion was based on observations in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bandpasses .",
    "there is no reason to assume that it does not apply equally well to the @xmath8 bandpass .",
    "the study - to - study repeatability of @xmath3 magnitudes may well be worse than this , since the @xmath3 bandpass is atmosphere - defined on the short - wavelength side , and moreover it includes the balmer convergence and jump , which are affected nonlinearly by temperature and are also sensitive to surface gravity . ) these study - to - study differences are not simply correlated with color ( if they were , they could be removed in the transformation ) , and they can not be improved by taking better data with the same equipment .",
    "thus they do not depend upon the internal precision of any given investigation .",
    "this justifies our refusal to weight individual measurements on the basis of their published standard errors or the number of independent measurements in any given study as we compare the different photometric systems .",
    "the third panel of table  3 lists the median magnitude difference found between the sarajedini data and each of the other photometric studies . since",
    "astronomical measurements are subject to many small random uncertainties and also sometimes to large sporadic mistakes , they often do not follow a simple gaussian probability distribution .",
    "when mistakes happen , a few large deviations can dominate a traditional statistical analysis .",
    "therefore , we present these median offsets because they are more `` robust '' or `` resistant '' than the arithmetic mean  more representative of the typical magnitude difference without being as strongly influenced by a few extreme outliers that might be due to the inclusion of variable stars , typographical errors , or urecognized peculiar anomalies caused by , for instance , contrails , cosmic rays , or insects in the apparatus . for the same reason , the fourth panel of the table lists @xmath22 times the mean absolute difference between the tabulated magnitudes in each study and the sarajedini data after removal of the median offset .",
    "this is a measure of the dispersion in the magnitude differences that is less affected by the most extreme outliers than the more commonly used root - mean - square statistic . if the frequency distribution of the magnitude differences were accurately gaussian in form , then the expectation value of the standard deviation @xmath14 would be equal to @xmath23 times the mean absolute deviation .",
    "a comparison of the mean and median magnitude differences shows that they are practically the same , suggesting little or no skewness in the distributions  there is no evidence that any one study tended to have large errors that were preferentially too bright or too faint .",
    "however , the robust estimators of dispersion in the fourth panel of the table are systematically smaller than the standard deviations given in the second panel , indicating that the magnitude measurements have probability distributions that are somewhat non - gaussian in form , with an excess of unusually large discrepancies ( positive kurtosis ) .",
    "the fifth panel of the table indicates how many stars were used in each comparison .",
    "the first and third panels of table  3 should each be considered to contain a row of zeros for the offset of the sarajedini dataset with respect to itself . if we include those zeros and average together the seven offsets in each filter ( in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , fewer in @xmath3 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 ) , then we get the average offset of the entire ensemble of seven photometric systems relative to the sarajedini system and the standard deviation of those systems about the mean system .",
    "these numbers are contained in the rows labeled `` average '' and `` standard deviation . ''",
    "these show that whether we judge by mean or median offset , in every filter the sarajedini magnitude scale is fainter than the average of all seven by amounts ranging up to @xmath180.04 .",
    "accordingly , we infer that the optimum compromise magnitude scale in each filter is one that is brighter than the sarajedini system by the indicated amounts .",
    "we also see that the standard deviation of the offsets in the different studies and filters averages of order 0.04@xmath2mag .",
    "this indicates that any one attempt to establish a magnitude scale in the field of has typically been subject to an unknown systematic error with a standard deviation of roughly 0.04@xmath2mag .",
    "therefore we hope that by thus averaging the results of seven different calibration attempts , we have been able to establish a compromise magnitude scale that is _ probably _ on the true johnson system to within @xmath24mag ( standard error of the mean ) in each of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with correspondingly poorer confidence in @xmath3 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 .",
    "examination of table  3 reveals at most a slight tendency for the offsets in @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be correlated .",
    "if they were in fact correlated one - to - one , it would be possible to consider the zero - point of the  scale to have been established with essentially negligible uncertainty .",
    "but in the present case , splitting the difference between the mean and median offsets and rounding to the nearest 0.01@xmath2mag we find that the zero - point of sandage s  color scale is 0.01@xmath2mag bluer than sarajedini s , the eggen & sandage `` e '' colors are 0.02@xmath2mag redder , the eggen & sandage `` s '' data agree with sarajedini s , platais s are 0.01 redder , and the cmr2 and wkg colors are 0.07@xmath2mag and 0.04@xmath2mag bluer , respectively . with the data as they are , it seems a worse - case scenario is more likely : while the mean of the seven color scales is about 0.02@xmath2mag bluer than sarajedini s , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are largely uncorrelated and the standard deviation of the different color zero - points is about 0.03@xmath2mag .",
    "therefore we expect that the systematic uncertainty of the zero - point of the color scale is probably @xmath25mag : the absolute johnson  colors of s stars will be uncertain by at least this amount quite apart from any uncertainty in the foreground reddening .    splitting the difference between the mean and median offsets",
    ", we conclude that the optimum compromise magnitudes will be brighter than sarajedini s by 0.004 , 0.041 , 0.028 , 0.043 , and 0.028@xmath2mag in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 , respectively . at the same time , for instance , the eggen `` e '' photoelectric @xmath4 magnitudes should be shifted fainter : that is , to remove the 0.064@xmath2mag net offset between the sarajedini @xmath4-band magnitudes and those of the eggen `` e '' sample , we shift the former brighter by 0.041@xmath2mag and the latter fainter by 0.023@xmath2mag , bringing both to the average system of all seven studies .",
    "this is done for all the datasets and filters , with the individual corrections listed in the last section of table  3 .",
    "having referred every dataset to a common magnitude system , we are now able to form unbiased averages of the various studies magnitudes for stars in common .",
    "when this is done , we find that we have a total of ( 896 , 7519 , 7819 , 1549 , 1543 ) stars with at least one valid measurement in ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 ) , respectively . if we restrict the sample to those stars with at least two independent measurements in a given filter , they number ( 140 , 1440 , 1560 , 299 , 300 ) .    for our immediate purposes , we selected the 299 stars in the sample that have at least two independent calibrated measurements in _ each _ of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 .",
    "these stars were then used as local in - frame standards that permitted us to recalibrate our own ccd reductions , including images that were obtained under non - photometric conditions ( , the plaskett ; bond ; and non - cmr2 , non - wkg int images ) , to the same magnitude system as the rest . from the results of this analysis of our own ccd images , we extracted 1,041 well - observed stars with ( a )  at least five measurements _ and _ an estimated standard error of the mean magnitude not worse than 0.1@xmath2mag in all of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 , and ( b )  a modified welch - stetson variability index ( welch & stetson 1993 ) not larger than 2.5 times the median value .",
    "next , the calibrated magnitudes for these 1,041 stars were averaged with the five previous independent photometric samples ( _ viz . _",

    "once known variable stars and the blended star i-18 were excluded , from this stage there emerged 1,722 stars which had satisfactory ( @xmath26mag ) measurements in each of @xmath4 and @xmath5 from at least two different studies .",
    "these stars should now represent just about the best reference list that we can achieve  a gold standard  for determining and removing systematic photometric offsets from the remaining six datasets , which did not previously have fully independent calibrations : the sandage ( 1962 ) photographic data , and the sharov ( 1965 ) , cannon ( 1968 ) , mcclure & twarog ( 1977 ) , caputo  ( 1990 ) , and dinescu  ( 1996 ) results .",
    "there is no need to impose a selection on the @xmath3 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 filters at this point , since none of these studies presented @xmath3 , @xmath8 , or @xmath6 data .",
    "the offsets we derive for these samples are listed in table  4 , but several of the datasets need a bit more discussion .",
    "* sandage photographic : * photographic magitudes are listed for six stars which we could not find on the published charts : i-123 , i-125 , i-126 , i-127 , i-159 , and ii-33 .",

    "three other stars , i-158 , ii-178 , and ii-205 , were manually removed from the comparison because their magnitudes differed from our adopted reference magnitudes by more than 1@xmath2mag in one or both filters .",
    "* sharov : * sharov star 93 had a magnitude residual a bit larger than 1@xmath2mag in @xmath5 .",
    "this star was manually removed from the comparison .    *",
    "mcclure : * photometry is provided for stars identified as 125 , 136 , and 137 , but we were unable to locate these stars on the published finding chart .",
    "the tabulated @xmath5 magnitudes for stars 173 and 174 are 11.94 and 12.55 , respectively , and for both the  color is given as 0.28 .",
    "this is clearly a mistake .",
    "the two stars are blended together , but it is evident from mcclure & twarog s finding chart and other available images that each component of the blend is fainter than the nearby star 140 , for which the authors list @xmath27 .",
    "our own @xmath5 magnitudes for stars 173 and 174 are 15.48 and 16.69 , while for 140 we get @xmath28 .",
    "we exclude the mcclure values for 173 and 174 from further consideration .    *",
    "caputo : * three distinct but partially overlapping ccd fields were studied in . as a result",

    "we employed the mean of the two magnitudes in each filter for each of these stars , but weighted them the same as stars that were measured once since our purpose here is to compare photometric systems , and the number of observations for a given star does not affect the system that it is on . also , the caputo  study lists the visual magnitude of star ii-212 as 15.15 .",
    "we suspect this is a typographical error : changing the value to 17.15 brings this observation into excellent agreement with all the other studies that measured this star",
    ". finally , the caputo @xmath4-band magnitudes for stars i - e3 and i - e18 are both more than a magnitude fainter than found by sarajedini , platais , and our own study , while the @xmath5-band magnitudes for both stars are in reasonable agreement .",

    "it becomes useful to consider the photometric precision of each individual observation .",
    "our own reductions and the results of sarajedini and platais associate a standard error with each photometric measurement .",
    "the sandage ( 1962 ) and eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) photoelectric lists , and the sharov and the dinescu photographic data do not include standard errors _ per se _ , but they do specify the number of times each star was observed .",
    "caputo  list only one magnitude in each filter for most stars , but 19 stars were measured twice because they fell in overlap regions of different subfields . finally , mcclure & twarog list only photometric indices on a star - by - star basis , with no indication of precision or the number of independent measurements for any given star .",
    "for those nine studies which do not list quantitative standard errors , we will estimate the precision from a comparison with our gold standard .",
    "these results are summarised in table  5 . for each study (",
    "column 1 ) , columns 2 and 3 give the average root - mean - square difference between the gold - standard values and the offset - corrected measurements of that study in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 filters ; columns 4 and 5 give 1.2533 @xmath16 the mean absolute difference ; and column 6 gives the arithmetic average of these four estimates of the observational scatter .",
    "column 7 gives the mean number of observations per star in the study , and column 8 gives the inferred standard error of one observation ; for the first three samples this has been multiplied by a further factor of @xmath29 to account for the fact that each of these studies was included in the definition of the gold - standard system .",
    "for the nine studies in this table , the uncertainty of an individual tabulated magnitude will be assumed to be the value in the last column divided by the square root of the number of times that star was observed .",
    "the same formula will apply without distinction to the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bandpasses .",
    "this approach is not strictly rigorous in a mathematical sense , but it should be good enough for our purposes given the limitations of the data .",
    "the last three studies are those of sarajedini , platais , and us . in the case of the platais study ,",
    "their data table lists a `` standard deviation '' for each photometric index ; we assume that this represents the standard error of one measurement because it varies with magnitude but is almost completely independent of the number of times the star was measured . accordingly , we will divide this standard deviation by the square root of the number of measurements .",
    "furthermore , the platais dataset lists @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; for our purposes we take @xmath32 $ ] . the sarajedini data and our own analysis give uncertainties for the individual magnitudes rather than for derived colors , and these are what we will use .",
    "however , for all three studies  sarajedini , platais , and ours  we add a further uncertainty of 0.015@xmath2mag in quadrature to lessen the impact of individual measured magnitudes that , due to random statistical fluctuations and roundoff effects , have tabulated standard errors @xmath180.000 .",
    "( if the listed uncertainties were taken literally , a star with a standard error of 0.001 , for instance , should have four times the weight of one with a standard error of 0.002 .",
    "we believe this would be unrealistic . ) this additional error component can be taken to represent the irreducible star - to - star photometric differences due to filter mismatch . in the case of our own photometric study , this is likely to be unduly pessimistic since we combined data from six observing runs on three telescopes employing six different detectors , which should beat down the net effects of bandpass mismatch .",
    "given these precepts , the data from the twelve different sets were merged into a single star list with weighted mean magnitude values in each filter for which observations were available .",
    "the weights were the inverse square of the observational uncertainties as laid out in table  5 and the previous paragraph , and the uncertainty of a final averaged magnitude was taken to be the inverse square root of the sum of the weights .",
    "the actual study - to - study repeatability of the results for any individual star was not considered , except insofar as observations discrepant by more than one magnitude were discarded .",
    "the information posted at our web site will allow interested readers to recover the various studies separate results for any given star .",
    "we would like to mention a couple of small items that came to our attention as we were working with these datasets .",
    "we present them here in case they could help future researchers .",
    "kaluzny & shara ( 1987 ) identify variable star v8 as sandage star iii-9 ; we believe that it is actually iii-89 .",
    "zhang ( 2002 ) have east and west reversed in their fig .",
    "they also did not note that their v12 = sandage iii-51 .",
    "four previous studies have used measurements of stellar proper motions to define membership indicators for stars in the field : cannon ( 1968 ) ; upgren , mesrobian & kerridge ( 1972 ) ; dinescu  ( 1996 ) ; and platais  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the last three studies , in particular , published quantitative membership probabilities based on each star s proper motion relative to the average cluster and field proper - motion distributions .",
    "the dinescu paper also presented a second probability estimate which includes consideration of the star s position on the sky as well as its proper motion , but we will not employ this here in order to simplify the comparison with the other studies .",
    "the different sets of membership probabilities are generally in good , although not perfect agreement .",
    "fig .  1 , for example , shows the membership probabilities from dinescu plotted against those of platais for 345 stars in common .",
    "the dinescu paper lists photometric and astrometric results only for `` probable members and stars of special interest , '' so this plot contains very few stars with dinescu membership probabilities @xmath3360% . among these , however , it is noteworthy that there are many stars with dinescu probabilities close to 100% and platais probabilities close to 0% . between these extremes",
    "there is no perceptible correlation between the membership determinations apart from the general statement that there are a few stars for which both studies find the membership evidence inconclusive .",
    "finally , there are a very few stars which the dinescu study considers to be non - members but nevertheless `` of interest , '' which the platais study finds to be members .",
    "we have no way of guessing which other stars dinescu  may have measured and determined to be highly probable non - members , so if a star is not included in their data table we must assume that its membership is undetermined by dinescu , rather than assuming that they have established non - membership .",
    "the cannon study of proper motions does not present membership probabilities _ per se _ but rather gives a ratio of the amount by which the motion of a given star differs from the presumed cluster mean motion , divided by the uncertainty of the measurement . in fig .",
    "2 we plot cannon s ratio @xmath34 against the arithmetic mean of the membership probabilities for stars that appear in one or more of the upgren , dinescu , and platais studies .",
    "the results are more or less as expected in the sense that stars for which cannon finds a proper motion close to the cluster mean tend to have membership probabilities which are high in the other studies .",
    "conversely , when cannon has measured a large motion for a star , the other studies are emphatic that it is a non - member .",
    "it is curious that , although there are stars for which upgren , dinescu , and platais alone or in combination find membership probabilities of 90%100% , none of these stars was included in cannon s sample .",
    "perhaps cannon s stars were simply too bright for reliable astrometry in the more recent investigations .",
    "the correlation between cannon s @xmath34 and the other studies membership probabilities is not perfect : even for stars with cannon s lowest @xmath34 values there is a considerable range in the membership probabilities found by others .",
    "specifically , we find for stars with @xmath35 , the arithmetic mean membership probabilities from the other studies is 53% ( based on 84 stars ) ; for @xmath36 the mean membership probability is 22% ( 52 stars ) ; for @xmath37 it is 6% ( 43 stars ) ; and for @xmath38 it is 0% ( 112 stars ) .",
    "therefore , in order to convert cannon s @xmath34 to quantities which can be averaged with the membership probabilities from the other studies , we assign these numerical probabilities within the stated bins , except that we convert @xmath39 to a membership probability of precisely 50% . that way , if we divide a sample of `` members '' from `` non - members '' by making a cut at 50% , cannon s measurements will not change the decision one way or the other if @xmath39 and the star has been included in _ any _ of the other studies .",
    "if cannon s @xmath40 , then it will have the potential to represent a tie - breaking vote against membership if the other studies are inconclusive among themselves .",
    "fig .  3 presents a ( , @xmath5 ) color - magnitude diagram for probable members based upon all the photometric and astrometric data discussed in the previous sections .",
    "here we have plotted only stars for which the photometric uncertainty @xmath41mag ; large symbols have been used for stars with measured membership probabilities @xmath42% , and small symbols have been used for stars without measured proper motions ; stars with membership probabilities determined to be @xmath3350% , on average among the astrometric studies , have not been plotted .",
    "( we note that nobody ever assigns a membership probability of 100% : the highest membership probability listed in any of the studies is 99% .",
    "therefore , if a star appears in two proper - motion studies with a membership probability of 99% in one and 0% in the other  the most extreme case of disagreement possible  such a star will have a mean membership probability of 49.5% and will be excluded from the sample of probable members . )",
    "the cluster turnoff and subgiant branch are quite well defined , and a population of blue stragglers and a binary - star main sequence are also clear . the color - magnitude diagram shows the appearance of a `` subdwarf sequence '' consisting of roughly a dozen stars either a magnitude fainter or 0.4@xmath2mag bluer than the principal main sequence .",
    "however , if we apply the more stringent selection criteria @xmath43mag and membership probability @xmath4490% , none of these stars survives the cut .",
    "therefore they do not likely represent a challenge to our understanding of s stellar population .",
    "eggen & sandage ( 1969 ) found a gap roughly a tenth of a magnitude wide containing no cluster stars just below the main - sequence turnoff of , centered at magnitude @xmath45 .",
    "mcclure & twarog failed to reproduce the gap with their new photographic data , but nevertheless presented arguments supporting its reality .",
    "in particular , a gap near this magnitude was found when only the data from the innermost zone of the cluster were considered .",
    "however , such a gap is not predicted by modern stellar evolution models if we have correctly judged the chemical abundances and age of the cluster , even when diffusive effects are taken into account ( , michaud  2004 ) . even in 1977 , mcclure & twarog considered the gap to be `` only marginally expected '' on the basis of then - current theory .",

    "3 shows an enlargement of the main - sequence turnoff region of .",
    "the lower of the two arrows marks @xmath45 , which is the center of the eggen & sandage gap .",
    "the present data clearly do not support the presence of a gap at this apparent magnitude .",
    "the upper arrow , marking a gap which does appear in these data , lies at @xmath46 .",
    "mcclure & twarog also found a gap near this magnitude in their photometry for stars in sandage s ring ii but not for ring i. we are not prepared at present to argue that this gap is real and requires modifying current stellar evolution models .",
    "however , the anonymous referee of the first submitted draft of this paper has raised an interesting question : is the apparent color offset between the brightest stars below the gap and the faintest stars above it real ?",
    "morphologically , this sort of jog would be expected if the theoretical models did predict a gap for .",
    "however , the referee s question can probably only be answered with better photometry than is currently available .",
    "the referee has also made the interesting point that the eggen - sandage gap does appear to coincide with a lack of stars on the binary main sequence in our data .",
    "if so , it is difficult to see how it could be a consequence of stellar evolution .",
    "rather , it is almost certainly a fluke of small - number statistics .    to define the cluster fiducial sequences",
    ", we began by printing five diagrams for probable cluster members and stars without membership determinations : @xmath5 versus , @xmath5 versus , @xmath5 versus ,  versus  for stars fainter than @xmath47 ( mostly member dwarfs ) , and  versus  for stars brighter than @xmath47 ( mostly member subgiants and giants ) . into each of these five diagrams",
    "a fiducial sequence was sketched by hand , and the locations of representative points along that sequence were measured with a ruler .",
    "each of the five diagrams was measured twice , in orthogonal directions .",
    "that is to say , consider the @xmath5 versus  plot : when the color position of the hand - sketched locus is measured at equally spaced intervals of @xmath5 , we can say that we have measured the dependent variable ( @xmath5 ) as a function of the independent variable @xmath5 ; conversely , when the magnitude position of the locus is measured at fixed intervals of color , we can say that we have measured the dependent variable @xmath5 ( ) as a function of the independent variable .",
    "measurements were made at constant intervals of 0.5@xmath2mag in brightness when @xmath5 was the independent variable , 0.10@xmath2mag when  or  was the independent variable , and 0.05@xmath2mag when  was independent .",
    "when all five plots have been measured in the two orthogonal directions , we now have five different ways to define a @xmath5 versus  locus : we can plot @xmath5 versus ( @xmath5 ) ; we can plot @xmath5 ( ) versus ; we can plot @xmath5 versus ( @xmath5 ) + ( @xmath5 ) ; we can plot @xmath5 ( ) versus + ( ) ; and we can plot @xmath5 ( ) versus ( ) + .",
    "we hope that by combining these different approaches to defining the mean cluster locus , we can beat down the random error in our placement of the pencil line through the swarm of data points , any systematic bias in our placement of the millimeter ruler with respect to the plot tickmarks , or any random or systematic error in the way that we judge the intersection of the pencil line with the edge of the ruler .",
    "4 shows these five different versions of the @xmath5 versus  color - magnitude diagram , where different symbols are used to designate the different definitions of the fiducial locus .",
    "it is apparent that the five different curves are in excellent agreement except for some slight ambiguity at the top of the giant branch .",
    "we then printed a new copy of fig .",
    "4 at twice the scale used for the previous plots , sketched a smooth curve through the normal points , and read out compromise representative positions along the curve , again in both directions , this time at 0.25@xmath2mag intervals in @xmath5 and 0.05@xmath2mag in .",
    "this was subsequently checked by overplotting the resulting curve on a color - magnitude diagram for the individual stars , and modest adjustments were made .",
    "we regard this fiducial sequence as the fundamental result of the present paper .",
    "the  color is attractive for this purpose because it provides the greatest possible ratio of range to measuring error ; it is therefore optimally sensitive to temperature among the photometric bandpasses available to us at this time .",
    "this sensitivity also has the effect of providing the greatest possible discrimination between single main - sequence stars and the unresolved binaries that lie above and on the red side of the main sequence .",
    "the  color has the additional desirable quality that it is very nearly statistically independent of @xmath5 , given the way we that have calibrated the raw measurements .",
    "therefore there is little or no correlation between random temperature errors and random luminosity errors ( see , for instance , mcclure & tinsley 1976 to see why this can be relevant ) .",
    "having produced a smoothed @xmath5 versus  fiducial curve , we then plotted _ color _ versus  diagrams for probable member stars and stars of undetermined membership having photometric color uncertainties less than 0.10@xmath2mag , where `` _ color _ '' in this case stands for , , , and , each in turn .",
    "separate -_color _ plots were produced for stars respectively brighter and fainter than @xmath47 so as not to confuse member dwarfs with member giants .",
    "the distinction turns out to be important for colors involving the @xmath5 filter , in which dwarfs and giants show perceptibly different behavior ( as stetson  2003 also found in , in the case of the  color ) .",
    "we also produced @xmath5 versus _ color _ plots for each of the four colors and measured them in both directions .",
    "the fiducial points listed in table  6 represent a compromise between values visually measured in the _ color - v _ color - magnitude and -_color _ color - color diagrams . at the end of this process",
    ", there remains a certain amount of jitter in the tabulated curves ",
    "due mostly to differences of perception in the two orthogonal directions  which is probably a fair representation of the random uncertainties in the adopted fiducial points .",
    "the top panel of fig .  5 illustrates the  versus  color - color diagram for . here",
    "we have plotted only the 796 stars with at least a 50% membership probability and estimated color uncertainties @xmath48mag ; stars with membership probabilities measured to be less than 50% and stars without membership determinations have been omitted .",
    "stars with @xmath5-band magnitudes @xmath49 have been plotted as crosses and those brighter than 15.5 have been plotted as open circles .",
    "the middle panel of the figure is the analogous plot for  versus . as stetson  ( 2003 ) found in the case of the versus  color - color diagram for , there is a clear separation of cluster giants and dwarfs for the reddest colors , in the sense that at long wavelengths giants are bluer than dwarfs for fixed  colors .",
    "there is no clear separation with luminosity in an  versus  plot , which establishes an extra absorption component in the @xmath5 bandpass at high surface gravity as the most likely cause of the difference .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "5 plots the sum of the two long - wavelength colors versus ; combining the long - wavelength colors produces a slight improvement in the ratio of separation to scatter .",
    "the solid line in this plot represents the equation ( ) + ( ) = 1.70()0.04 , which we will use later as a discriminator between giants and dwarfs .",
    "this criterion is probably useful only for  colors larger than 0.901.00 ( or @xmath501.92.1 ) , but if a bluer star is found to be lying significantly above this line , it probably has large photometric errors or an unusual spectral - energy distribution .",
    "this giant / dwarf discriminator can be used as a ( weak ) membership indicator for those stars where the proper - motion evidence is marginal or lacking .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 is the ( ) + ( ) versus  diagram for the 163 stars in the  field with measured proper motions that imply membership probabilities @xmath51 , and photometric uncertainties in ( ) + ( ) @xmath48mag .",
    "here we have plotted stars lying above the giant / dwarf dividing line ( probable giants if the stars are red , possible photometric mistakes or peculiar stars if they are blue ) as open circles , and stars below the line ( probable normal dwarfs ) as crosses .",
    "the lower panel of this figure shows the @xmath5 versus  color - magnitude diagram for the same stars , where the symbols have the same meaning as in the upper panel and the solid curve is our adopted cluster fiducial sequence .",
    "here we see that many stars with ambiguous proper - motion membership determinations fall very near s main sequence and have the photometric properties of dwarfs .",
    "it is likely that the membership probabilities of these stars have been estimated low because their proper motions fall in the tail of the random distribution of measuring errors .",
    "this is a consequence of utilizing a fixed cluster / field star ratio in the probability calculations . if , for instance , the astrometrists were to consider the cluster / field star ratio only for those stars which fell within a few standard deviations of the mean cluster photometric locus , that ratio would be much higher than the ratio for all stars considered together .",
    "with such a calculation the membership probabilities of these stars would be significantly increased .",
    "( of course , using one cluster / field ratio for stars near the principal locus and another for stars off of it would greatly reduce the likelihood of finding peculiar cluster members .",
    "our point here is not to criticize the standard method of membership determination ; it is merely to point out that adopting any arbitrary membership cutoff larger than 0% involves the near certainty of rejecting some genuine cluster members .",
    "stars with intermediate membership probabilities  especially those with photometric properties consistent with cluster membership  should be considered possible members at least until other evidence , such as radial velocity or chemical abundances , can be included in the analysis . )",
    "there is one star with the photometric properties of a giant that lies very near the cluster giant branch .",
    "this is sharov  61 (=  cannon  661 = sarajedini  594 = platais  4856 = our  8648 ) with an average proper - motion membership probability @xmath52% .",
    "there are also two stars with giant - like colors that lie well to the red of the cluster giant branch : the bluer of the two is sandage  iii-94 (= sharov  78 = cannon  623 = upgren  200 = sarajedini  254 = platais  5607 = our 10120 ) with @xmath53%,% . ] and the other is sandage  c (= sharov  26 = cannon  672 = platais  4460 = sarajedini  1086 = our  6522 ) with @xmath54% . in the direction of red field stars with giant - like photometric properties are quite rare , as can be seen in fig .  7 , where we have produced the identical diagrams for 1,971 stars with measured proper - motion membership probabilities @xmath55% .",
    "although this diagram contains twelve times as many stars as fig .",
    "6 , there are _ no _ field stars redder than @xmath562.2 with the photometric properties of a giant down at least to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , in adopting a fixed ( cluster / field ) ratio for their probability calculations regardless of color , magnitude , or other independent information , the proper - motion studies may well have underestimated the membership probabilities of these two stars . a quick search of the simbad database produces no spectroscopic information for either star , but they probably do deserve spectroscopic study . if they are cluster members , they lie in the general region where carbon- , barium- , and related stars can be found .    figs .",
    "6 and 7 both show stars in the blue - straggler zone of the color - magnitude diagram in roughly similar numbers , although the latter diagram contains twelve times as many stars overall as the former .",
    "again , this may suggest that the membership probabilities of at least some of these stars have been underestimated because the number of true field stars in this box of magnitude and color is rather low compared to the rest of the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "8 shows the same two diagrams for 140 stars with adequate photometric data but whose proper motions have not been measured .",
    "since to have been omitted from the astrometric studies a star is likely to be either faint or crowded , the precision of these photometric indices tends to be poor . as a result ,",
    "the giant / dwarf discriminator is noisy and not very effective .",
    "nevertheless , there is no evidence that any possible giant members of the cluster have been missed by the astrometric studies , although there are a few additional faint stars that might belong to the cluster main sequence .",
    "9 compares our fiducial sequence to landolt s photometric standards  which may be taken at least as a representative , if not random , sample of solar neighborhood stars dominated by the local population  i  in the , , , and  colors , each plotted against . in each of the four panels , stars identified by smith  ( 2002 ) as belonging to luminosity class iii",
    "are shown as large filled circles , stars belonging to class v are large crosses and stars of other or undetermined luminosity classes are represented by small crosses . here",
    "we see that giants and dwarfs do indeed tend to be separated in diagrams involving the @xmath5 magnitude .",
    "we also see that the agreement between the cluster sequence and the field stars is quite good in every panel except the one showing , where our cluster - star  colors are about 0.015  to 0.025  redder than the field - star colors for fixed .",
    "given that the differences in the reddening and metallicity between and the average field star are not likely to be substantial , and especially in view of the fact that such an offset appears in only the one panel ( of all these colors ,  is the one _ least _ affected by reddening and line blanketing ) , our adopted @xmath8 magnitude scale is probably @xmath180.02  too bright , , the @xmath8 magnitudes are quantitatively too small so the  colors are too large . as the @xmath8 magnitude zero - point was determined from only two independent studies , each of which is probably uncertain at a level of @xmath180.03 , and which differ between themselves by 0.09  ( table  3 ) , such a level of systematic error is entirely plausible .",
    "notice that if this inference is correct , then sarajedini  measured their @xmath8 magnitudes only 0.02@xmath2mag too faint , rather than the 0.04@xmath2mag given in table  3 ; this is similar to their offsets in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters .",
    "10 presents a comparison of the fiducial sequences of three of the most famous old open clusters , ( crosses ; present study ) , m@xmath267 ( closed circles ) , and ( open circles ) ; these latter two sequences were adapted by sandage  ( 2003 ) from previous photometric investigations by montgomery , marschall & janes ( 1993 ; m67 ) and stetson ( 2003 ; ) . comparing the latter two clusters to an  fiducial derived from unpublished photometry by vandenberg & mcclure ( a preliminary analysis of the dao images forming a part of the present study )",
    ", sandage  found that the lower main sequence of  did not appear to lie parallel to those of the other two clusters .",
    "conventional stellar - structure theory would have a very difficult time explaining this circumstance if the metal abundances and foreground reddening values adopted for these systems were even remotely correct .",
    "the mean main sequence obtained in this paper from an appreciably expanded body of observational data does not confirm the disturbing trend found by sandage   in fact , not only does the sequence now parallel the other two , it also closely overlies the unevolved main sequence of m@xmath267 , implying that either we have correctly evaluated the relative metal abundances , reddenings , _ and _ distance moduli of these two clusters , or there is a pernicious conspiracy of systematic errors in two or more of these quantities . the unevolved main sequence of  stands well to the red of the sequences for the other two clusters by an amount which is consistent  as shown by sandage with an overall metal abundance which is greater by about + 0.4@xmath2dex than the common abundance of m@xmath267 and .mag than to the value @xmath58mag found by stetson  ( 2003 ) .",
    "if the lower reddening were adopted it would be necessary to make a corresponding adjustment to the apparent distance modulus of the cluster  to something like 13.25in order to bring its lower main sequence into coincidence with the red edge of the hipparcos color - magnitude diagram for nearby stars .",
    "the resulting comparison with m@xmath267 and  would still be very similar to that shown in fig .  10 . ]    finally , fig .",
    "11 shows a comparison between our fiducial main sequences in  and those of the local field population as defined by the stars in the gliese ( 1969 ) _ catalogue of nearby stars _ having photometry by bessell ( 1990 ) and hipparcos parallaxes ( perryman  1998 ) that are at least ten times their standard errors . in the @xmath59@xmath60 ( top panel ) and @xmath61@xmath60 ( bottom panel ) color - magnitude diagrams the agreement is excellent ,",
    "as would be expected if ( a )  the local field population and have similar chemical abundances ( both are estimated to have close to solar abundance patterns ) , ( b )  we have correctly judged the reddening and apparent distance modulus of the cluster , _ and _ ( c )  the systematic errors in our photometry are small .",
    "of course , as before , a conspiracy of errors in two or more of these assertions could produce spurious agreement .",
    "it is evident that the agreement in the @xmath62@xmath60 diagram ( middle panel ) is perceptibly worse .",
    "since , as we ve stated before ,  is the one color out of all these that is _",
    "least _ sensitive to both metallicity and reddening effects , it would be hard to remove this discrepancy by altering one or both of these quantities , especially given the good agreement in @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "we believe that this diagram is additional evidence for a systematic error in the zero - point of our adopted @xmath8 magnitude scale , in the sense that we have measured  stars too bright in @xmath8 , and therefore too red in , by about 0.02@xmath2mag .",
    "we have _ not _ removed this offset from the cluster data which we have posted on the internet ; users of these data for future research should be aware of this fact .",
    "we have obtained new ccd photometry for the old open cluster  with the dominion astrophysical observatory 1.8 m telescope .",
    "because these data are difficult to calibrate we have found it useful to consider additional data donated by howard bond , and data obtained from the isaac newton group archive , as well as all the previous cluster photometry that we were able to locate in the literature .",
    "direct star - by - star comparisons have been undertaken to determine and remove the systematic differences in photometric zero - point that are found among the various studies . at the same time",
    "we have merged the independent membership indices that have been produced by four different astrometric studies of the cluster field and matched those membership probabilities with the photometry for the same stars .",
    "it has been our aim to combine all the available datasets for , not to critique them .",
    "it must be remembered that we have removed only differences of photometric zero - point among the various published studies of the cluster .",
    "in actuality , systematic calibration errors can be more complicated than this : magnitude scales may vary with the color of the star if bandpass mismatch is not adequately modeled , or with the brightness of the star if the detector is not accurately linear , or with the position of the star on the sky when imaging detectors have significant distortions , aberrations , or scattered - light problems . the systematic errors between one dataset and another can in principle be modeled as a taylor expansion in these independent variables .",
    "we have contented ourselves with estimating and removing only the zeroth - order terms in these taylor expansions . to have attempted more than this",
    "would have required appreciably more work , and also it would likely have involved choosing one of the data sets to be the `` correct '' one and adjusting all the others to match it . by considering only mean values , it has been straightforward to define an `` average '' photometric system without having to choose any one study as being more authoritative than the others .    as a consequence",
    ", any given study has been accurately referenced to the average of all studies only for stars near the average color , magnitude , and position ; stars at extreme values of these variables may retain systematic differences from one study to another .",
    "we contend that these introduce mostly noise and not systematic error to the final data products , because  once the zero - point offsets have been removed  any study which has positive systematic errors in some regions of color - magnitude - position space will have comparable negative systematic errors in other parts of that space .",
    "furthermore , there is little reason to expect that such systematic errors will be identical in the various studies ( with the exception of the photographic studies that were calibrated on the basis of the photoelectric studies : in this situation any color- or magnitude - dependent errors in the photoelectric work may well have been mapped into the photographic results ) .",
    "average photometric indices determined from multiple investigations should therefore be more reliable than results for a star studied only once .    by adopting a single value for the photometric uncertainty inherent to each study , regardless of the brightness of the star or the filter used",
    ", we have again accounted for the different precisions of the various datasets only to zeroth order .",
    "once again , we think this is a reasonable compromise , and that a more complex approach to the weighting of the data would add extra work out of proportion to the improvement achieved .",
    "we believe that we have `` done no harm '' to the data in the hippocratic sense of the phrase : our homogenized results for any given star are probably not worse than the results from the best of the studies in which that star was included . nevertheless , the reader is encouraged to remember the compromises that we have made if using our results for future research",
    ". it would be unwise to base critical scientific conclusions on the photometric indices or membership status of any given star , especially if that star was observed only once or a few times .",
    "conclusions based upon the bulk properties of the stars in as they have been presented here are probably somewhat safer .    at our web site",
    "we have posted ascii data files containing ( a )  our final merged photometry , membership information , and j2000.0 equatorial coordinates for 9,228 stars in the field of ngc188 , based upon all available studies ; ( b )  our derived photometry for 4,863 stars based upon our own analysis of 299 ccd images ; ( c )  a transit table relating our sequential identification numbers to the star identifications employed in all the previous studies that we have considered ; and ( d )  those data tables from previous published studies which we have entered into the computer by hand , because we were unable to locate electronic copies .",
    "these files should make it easy for interested readers to reanalyze these data if our approach seems inadequate for their purposes .",
    "the authors would like to thank ata  sarajedini and imants  platais for providing machine - readable copies of their data tables .",
    "pbs continues to be very grateful to howard e. bond , the canadian astronomy data centre , and the isaac newton group archive for providing data for this and other ongoing studies .",
    "this work was supported , in part , by a discovery grant to dav from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
