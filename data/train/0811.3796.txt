    "blazars are a sub - category of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) whose jet emission is pointing close to our line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , the overall spectra of blazar sources ( plotted in the log@xmath3-log@xmath4 plane , where @xmath5 is the observed spectral flux energy density ) have two pronounced continuum components : one peaking between ir and x - rays and the other in the @xmath6-ray regime ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lower energy component is believed to be produced by the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons accelerated within the outflow , while inverse compton ( ic ) emission by the same electrons is most likely responsible for the formation of the high energy @xmath6-ray component .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars form a sequence in luminosity , with more luminous sources having both peaks at lower energies than their fainter counterparts @xcite . in this sequence , flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs )",
    "are the most luminous objects .",
    "it is widely believed , in addition , that the ic emission from fsrqs is dominated by the scattering of soft photons external to the jet ( external compton process , erc ) .",
    "those photons , in turn , are produced by the accretion disk , and interact with the jet either directly or indirectly , after being scattered or reprocessed in the broad - line region ( blr ) or a dusty torus ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other sources of seed photons can also contribute to the observed ic component ; in particular , those can be the synchrotron photons themselves , radiating via the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process @xcite .",
    "in fsrqs , the synchrotron emission peaks around ir frequencies , and thus the nonthermal x - ray emission is relatively weak compared to that of other types of blazar sources .",
    "these spectral features suggest that fsrqs are well - suited for searching for the bulk compton ( bc ) spectral component , which is produced by comptonization of external uv radiation by cold electrons in a jet @xcite . using @xmath0 data of pks1510@xmath7089",
    ", @xcite argued that the observed soft x - ray excess below 1  kev and the plausible one at @xmath8  kev may be such bulk - compton features produced by inhomogeneities prior to their collision and shock formation ( the latter being the site of particle acceleration and production of the nonthermal radiation ) .",
    "swift j0746.3 + 2548 ( j0746 ) was identified with an optically faint quasar at @xmath1 detected in the 15200  kev energy band the burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the @xmath9 satellite .",
    "its broadband spectrum is representative of other fsrqs , which have two continuum components : one peaking at ir wavelengths and the other at mev energies .",
    "this qualifies j0746 as a likely new member of the mev blazar class @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum observed by @xmath9 xrt was hard in the 0.58 kev with a photon index @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 data showed spectral hardening at energies @xmath111  kev , which @xcite interpreted as an excess absorption over the galactic value , or a flatter power - law component , implying a sharp ( @xmath12 ) spectral break at @xmath134  kev .",
    "it has been argued that a clear distinction between the two possibilities can be made by @xmath0 , due to its broad bandpass , good photon statistics and low background data .    in 2005 november , simultaneous observations were performed with the very large array ( vla ; radio ) , the 26 m diameter university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ; radio ) , the 14 m diameter mets@xmath14hovi radio - telescopes ( radio ) , the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; optical ) , the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope(not ; optical ) , @xmath9 xrt and uvot ( optical - uv , x - ray ) and @xmath0 ( x - ray ) .",

    "after this screening and the dead time correction using `` pseudo - events '' @xcite , the net exposure for good time intervals becomes 74.0  ksec .",
    "the pin spectrum is dominated by the time - variable instrumental background induced by cosmic - rays and trapped charged particles in the satellite orbit .",
    "the hxd instrument team has developed an effective method @xcite of modeling the time - dependent non - x - ray background ( nxb ) by making use of the pin upper discriminator ( ud ) signal that monitors passing charged particles through the silicon pin diode .",

    "another component of the hxd pin background is the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",

    "as reported in @xcite , the response file returns 15% larger flux at the hxd nominal position pointing than the xis flux .",

    "overall , the spectra do not differ dramatically from the spectrum of the blazar available from the sdss archive .",
    "however , there is clearly a fading component in the continuum . in the first spectrum ,",
    "a power - law fit to the continuum to the red of ly@xmath27 gives @xmath28 ; during the second observation the continuum flux was @xmath29 , the residual slit losses leave a @xmath30% uncertainty in the absolute fluxes .",
    "the broad - line flux is , as expected , nearly constant on this timescale , confirming the relative spectral normalization estimated from the direct images .",
    "the difference spectrum between the two epochs is nearly pure continuum , with a spectral index of @xmath27  @xmath13  22.5 , suggesting that a fading synchrotron component is contributing to the optical flux during the tail of the outburst .",

    "( 2 ) the observed x - ray spectrum is well - described by a hard power - law ( @xmath83 ) with the galactic absorption .",
    "thanks to the good photon statistics and spectral response of @xmath0 xis , we clearly confirmed that j0746 has an intrinsically hard spectrum and can exclude the possibility that the spectral hardening results from the excess absorption as reported by @xcite . such differences of the spectrum between @xmath9 and @xmath0 are probably due to ( 1 ) low statistics of @xmath9 xrt compared to @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) @xcite combining the x - ray spectra obtained at 4 different epochs , with different exposures .",
    "the observed photon index is extremely hard , similar to those observed in several high - luminosity blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as long as the x - ray emission is due to the low - energy end of the erc spectral component , the observed photon index @xmath83 corresponds to the electron distribution @xmath84 , where @xmath6 is the lorentz factor of the ultrarelativisitic electrons .",
    "a likely explanation of such a flat electron distribution is discussed by @xcite who assume a two - step acceleration process : the harder portion is produced by a pre - acceleration mechanism , e.g. , involving instabilities driven by shock - reflected ions @xcite or magnetic reconnection @xcite , while the high energy tail by the standard first - order fermi process operating over the shock front .",
    "as the cold electrons / positrons , before reaching the blazar dissipative site , are transported from the black hole vicinity by a jet with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath85  1020 , they upscatter the accretion disk and broad emission line photons to energies @xmath86 where @xmath87  ev .",

    "it should be noted here that in the case of the popular internal shock model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the bulk - compton radiation is produced by two cold inhomogeneities / shells . in this case production of any nonthermal",
    "flare by the internal shock should be proceded by a pair of x - ray precursors : one produced by a faster shell at larger energies and lasting shorter ; and one produced by a slower shell at lower energies and lasting longer .",
    "radiative bulk - compton features from such systems are very complex , are variable and depend on the model details @xcite .",
    "however , a small amplitude of variability in j0746 ( see figure  [ fig : xis_lc ] ) suggests that if the primary dissipative events are driven by internal shocks , what we observe is an overlap of radiation contributed by several shocks .",
    "then the upper limits for the bulk - compton emission calculated using the steady state may be a reasonable approximation .      noting that the energy flux carried by the cold electrons is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the cross - section radius of a jet , one can find after combining eq .",

    "this is in a clear disagreement with the obtained upper limit for @xmath103 and the model value of @xmath104",
    ".    such situation may be avoided if one assumes that there are cold protons which carry significant power @xmath105 . in this case @xmath106 , and , provided that jet kinetic luminosity @xmath107 , the pair content reads as @xmath108 noting that the luminosity of the observed high energy ( @xmath6-ray ) emission can be related to the jet kinetic luminosity via the relation @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the efficiency of the high energy @xmath6-ray production , we finally find that the upper limit for the pair content of the j0746 jet is @xmath111 for j0746 , we only have an upper limit on the gamma - ray flux of @xmath112  erg  s@xmath18 . with this , and @xmath113  erg  s@xmath18 , we obtained @xmath114 .",
    "this may indicate a rather low pair content in quasar jets .",
    "however , it should be noted that j0746 has an exceptionally hard x - ray spectrum . for blazars with softer x - ray spectra",
    "a lack of bulk - compton features put weaker constraints , @xmath115 tens , but the inertia of such jets is still dominated by protons @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of @xmath0 observation for the radio - loud quasar j0746 at @xmath116 in 2005 november .",
    "our results are the following :    1 .",
    "the variability amplitude of soft and hard bands as measured by @xmath0 is equivalent and there is no significant energy - dependence of the variability , in contrast to the much larger ( factor of 2 ) variability reported from the swift data .",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum of j0746 is well - described by a single , extremely hard power - law ( @xmath83 ) with the galactic absorption ; we do not require spectral hardening at the lowest energies seen by @xcite . with this",
    ", we can exclude excess absorption ( which would otherwise have to be rapidly variable ! ) to cause the spectral hardening , one of the possibilities considered by @xcite .",
    "3 .   a lack of bulk compton features in the x - ray spectra indicates a low electron - positron pair content and strong dominance jet inertia by protons .",
