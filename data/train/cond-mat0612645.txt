    "the path integral formalism first introduced by feynman @xcite represents a rich and flexible general mathematical setting for dealing with quantum and statistical theories . the most obvious success of path integrals has been the ease with which they have allowed us to extend the quantization procedure to ever more complicated systems . on a more practical note , the formalism has been extremely useful for handling symmetries , deriving non - perturbative results and connections between different theories @xcite , and as a catalysts for the exchange of key ideas between different areas of physics , most notably high energy and condensed matter physics @xcite . today , analytical and numerical approaches to path integrals @xcite play important roles not only in physics but also in chemistry , materials science , mathematics and modern finance .",
    "further development of the path integral method is constrained by the small number of solvable models , as well as by our rather limited knowledge of their precise mathematical properties . in an attempt to fill this void a recent series of papers @xcite has investigated the dynamical implications of the property of stochastic self - similarity of path integrals by studying the relation between path integral discretizations of different coarseness .",
    "this has resulted in a systematic analytical construction of a hierarchy of @xmath0-fold discretized effective actions @xmath1 labeled by a whole number @xmath2 and built up from the naively discretized action in the mid - point prescription ( corresponding to @xmath3 ) .",
    "it was shown that the level @xmath2 effective actions lead to discretized transition amplitudes differing from the continuum limit by a term of order @xmath4 .",
    "these analytical results in fact represent an explicit derivation of the generalization of euler s summation formula to path integrals @xcite .    from a numerical stand point",
    "the new method has lead to a many order of magnitude speedup of path integral simulations by making it possible to get precise results using small values of @xmath0 .",
    "the substantial numerical speedup is the direct result of the new analytical input that makes it possible to trade high @xmath0 ( high cost in computing time ) for low @xmath0 and high @xmath2 .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 the overall speedup in convergence of the algorithm is typically eight orders of magnitude @xcite over the defining algorithm , or five orders of magnitude when compared to previous state - of - the - art algorithms @xcite based on the generalized trotter formula @xcite , or other short - time approximation schemes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the applicability of the above method from transition amplitudes to the calculation of expectation values .",
    "in particular , we focus on energy expectation values .",
    "it is well known that the efficient calculation of energy expectation values necessitates the use of the optimal energy estimators @xcite .",
    "an excellent review of different energy estimators is given in @xcite . in order to increase convergence of energy expectation values to the continuum limit it is necessary to understand how the estimators need to change as we move through the hierarchy of effective actions .",
    "in fact , if estimator and effective action are not synchronized then the increase in convergence for transition amplitudes does not translate into a corresponding increase in convergence for energy expectation values .",
    "the central result of this paper is the explicit analytical construction of optimal energy estimators for each hierarchy level @xmath2 .",
    "we show that energy expectation values calculated using @xmath2 level effective actions and the associated energy estimators derived here converge to the correct continuum value as @xmath4 , i.e. lead to the same increase in convergence ( and algorithm speedup ) previously seen for transition amplitudes .",
    "we have carried out a series of monte carlo simulations of several models ( anharmonic oscillator , pschl - teller potential , morse potential ) and have shown explicitly that the increase in convergence ( and the ensuing speedup in numerical calculation of energy expectation values ) agrees with the analytical derivations .",
    "the figures presented in the paper illustrate the results of these simulations for the case of an anharmonic oscillator with quartic coupling .",
    "section  [ sec : estimators ] starts with a brief overview of notation and an introduction to different energy estimators .",
    "it then develops the procedure for determining the estimator associated to each effective action at hierarchy level @xmath2 .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical ] presents the results of our monte carlo simulations . in the appendix we give the explicit expressions for the energy estimators for @xmath6 .",
    "the results for @xmath7 and the codes used can be found on our web site @xcite .",
    "in the functional formalism the transition amplitude ( in euclidean time ) @xmath8 is given in terms of a path integral which is simply the @xmath9 limit of the @xmath10- fold integral expression @xmath11 the euclidean time interval @xmath12 $ ] has been subdivided into @xmath0 equal time steps of length @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the integrand is given in terms of the naively discretized action @xmath16 .",
    "for actions of the form @xmath17 the naively discretized action ( in the mid - point ordering prescription ) equals @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "note that we use units in which @xmath21 and particle mass have been set to unity .",
    "as can be seen , the very definition of path integrals makes necessary the transition from continuum to the discretized theory .",
    "this discretization , however , is far from unique .",
    "we are free to introduce additional terms that explicitly vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "although such additional terms do not change the continuum physics , they do affect the speed of convergence to that continuum limit . a recent series of papers @xcite has studied the relation between discretizations of different coarseness and has analytically constructed a hierarchy of effective actions @xmath1 .",
    "the starting member of the hierarchy corresponds to @xmath3 and is given by eq .",
    "( [ actionn ] ) , the naively discretized action in the mid - point prescription .",
    "the @xmath2-level effective action leads to discretized amplitudes that converge to their continuum values as @xmath22    before extending the above outlined procedure to improve the convergence of energy expectation values , we briefly review the standard procedure for their calculation .",
    "the canonical partition function of statistical mechanics @xmath23 is given in terms of diagonal transition amplitudes where the inverse temperature @xmath24 plays the role of propagation time @xmath25 . from the above it",
    "directly follows that the partition function may be written in terms of a path integral  the continuum limit of the @xmath0-fold integral @xmath26 where integration is over all periodic trajectories @xmath27 . in the discretized theory",
    "this simply implies that @xmath28 .",
    "path integral monte carlo simulations use two different types of energy estimators   kinetic \" and  virial \" . both types of estimators",
    "are well known and have been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "we start with the `` kinetic '' estimator which follows from straightforward differentiation of the partition function .",
    "the ( thermal ) expectation value of the energy @xmath29 is simply the continuum limit of @xmath30 note that @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 . using this",
    "we finally find that @xmath33 e^{-s_n}\\ .\\ ] ] putting in the naively discretized action we recover the so - called `` kinetic '' estimator of the energy @xmath34    the last term on the right hand side is clearly the potential energy estimator .",
    "the second term is what one would naively take to be the estimator for kinetic energy .",
    "this term , however , diverges in the continuum limit .",
    "in fact , the role of the first term in the above expression ( the one coming from the path integral measure ) is precisely to cancel this divergence .",
    "the above estimator , taken as a whole , is well behaved in the continuum limit . however , the fact that it is given as a difference of two diverging terms implies that its variance diverges with @xmath0 .",
    "it is advantageous , therefore , to find another estimator having the same mean value but with smaller variance .",
    "this second type of energy estimator is called  virial \" as it is based on the virial theorem @xmath35 to derive this in the path integral formalism we rescale the coordinates in eq .",
    "( [ partitionfunction ] ) according to @xmath36 . by setting @xmath37 all the @xmath24 dependence",
    "is removed from the path integral measure , and we get @xmath38 \\right\\}\\ .\\ ] ] differentiating with respect to @xmath39 we find the  virial \" estimator for the energy to be @xmath40 as expected , the new estimator is a sum of terms that are finite in the continuum limit and so leads to smaller variance .",
    "the remaining work presented in this paper uses the ",
    "virial \" estimator given above and its @xmath2 level generalizations . from now on we drop the designation  virial \" .",
    "as we have seen , the estimator follows directly from the naive discretized action .",
    "if instead of @xmath16 we use some other effective action @xmath1 in the same hierarchy we directly determine the associated estimator at this level .",

    "proceeds in precisely the same way .",
    "the effective actions become more complex as we move up the hierarchy , so that the corresponding @xmath2 level estimators are most easily calculated using using a standard package for algebraic calculations such as mathematica .",
    "explicit expressions for the energy estimators for @xmath6 are given in the appendix .",
    "the results for @xmath7 as well as the monte carlo codes used in this paper can be found on our web site @xcite .",
    "the outlined procedure of matching a discretized action to its corresponding estimator has the property that amplitudes ( and partition functions ) have the same continuum limit as energy expectation values . as a result , by consistently using @xmath2 level effective actions and associated estimators we are guaranteed to have @xmath46 in the following section we present explicit monte carlo simulations that verify this behavior .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in this section were done using grid - adapted monte carlo code and were run on egee - ii and see - grid-2 infrastructure @xcite .",
    "as already indicated , we carried out a series of monte carlo simulations for several models , including anharmonic oscillator , modified pschl - teller potential , and morse potential .",
    "we determined explicitly that the speedup in convergence of energy expectation values of a general model precisely conforms to the analytical result given in eq .",
    "( [ convergence ] ) .",
    "the figures presented in this section give the results of simulations for the case of an anharmonic oscillator with quartic coupling using different levels @xmath2 .",

    "the lines represent curve fits of the data to polynomials in @xmath53 .",

    "the dashed lines are polynomial data fits in @xmath53 starting from @xmath4 , the leading terms @xmath4 are given as solid lines .",
    "the deviations from the continuum limit @xmath56 become extremely small for larger values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 and are masked by statistical monte carlo errors .",
    "for this reason , one would need to use an even larger @xmath57 in order to show the @xmath5 level deviation curve .",
    "said another way , the @xmath5 result for @xmath58 is already well within the statistical error for @xmath59 .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the effective actions and energy estimators for a give @xmath0 get more complex as we go to higher values of @xmath2 .",

    "we notice that for @xmath68 the dependence is essentially exponential . because of this increase in complexity , computations using @xmath69 are about 37 times slower than that with @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , increase of @xmath2 drastically improves convergence to the continuum limit , making it possible to obtain the same precision using much smaller values of @xmath0 . even for @xmath5",
    "the gain in precision outweighs the increase in computation time arising from complexity by many orders of magnitude .",

    "we have shown that a consistent choice of effective action and estimator leads to the same form of speedup for expectation values that was previously seen for transition amplitudes , i.e. at @xmath2 level the discretized expectation values differ from the continuum as @xmath4 .",
