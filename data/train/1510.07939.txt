    "atom interferometers are rapidly evolving , being used as new quantum sensors for fundamental physics experiments and in several other applications @xcite . in gravitational physics , for example , they enable precise measurements of gravity @xcite , gravity gradients @xcite , gravity curvature @xcite , and of the newtonian gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "important goals are the increase of their sensitivity and the demonstration of interferometry with atomic species other than alkali atoms , which are most commonly used .",
    "for some experiments , indeed , the possibility of choosing the atomic species with the right characteristics is crucial . in particular",
    ", for precision measurements there is a considerable interest in using alkaline - earth or alkaline - earth - like atoms , such as ca , sr or yb @xcite , that are already used for the most advanced optical atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "alkaline - earth atoms have several characteristics that make them particularly interesting in this context .",
    "firstly , their zero electronic angular momentum in the @xmath1s@xmath2 ground state makes these atoms less sensitive to perturbation due to magnetic fields than alkali atoms .",
    "furthermore , they offer more flexibility thanks to the presence of both dipole allowed transitions and narrow intercombination transitions that can be used for efficient multiphoton bragg diffraction @xcite and for single - photon atom interferometry schemes @xcite . finally , resonance transitions from the ground state are in the blue / near - uv ( e.g. , 461 nm for sr , 399 nm for yb ) resulting in a larger momentum transferred to the atoms for the same diffraction order compared to alkali atoms and hence in a correspondingly higher potential sensitivity of the interferometers .    here",
    ", we demonstrate the first atom interferometer based on large momentum transfer ( lmt ) bragg diffraction in a fountain of alkaline - earth atoms , namely strontium , and its use for the measurement of gravity acceleration .",
    "in addition to the general features of alkaline - earth atoms listed above , the ^88^sr isotope that we use in this work has specific favorable characteristics : it has no nuclear spin so that in the ground state it is a scalar particle which is virtually insensitive to stray magnetic fields , and its small scattering length @xmath3 @xcite results in reduced decoherence due to cold collisions .",
    "this allows , for example , observation of extremely long - lived bloch oscillations of ^88^sr atoms in a vertical optical lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "since strontium has no hyperfine structure in the ground state , the usual schemes based on raman transitions can not be employed to realize the beam splitters and the mirrors for an interferometer . in this work ,",
    "we use bragg diffraction which acting only on the atom s external degrees of freedom can split the atomic wavepacket into two momentum states separated by @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the bragg diffraction order , and @xmath6 is the wavevector of the bragg laser light with a wavelength @xmath7 ) , while maintaining the same electronic state .",
    "in fig.[fig.apparatus](a ) , a schematic view of the experimental apparatus is shown .",
    "the beams at 461 nm for the bragg transitions are produced by a home - made laser that is frequency - locked to the main cooling laser with a red detuning @xmath8 which is set , for different bragg orders , in the @xmath9 ghz range with respect to the @xmath10@xmath11 transition frequency .",
    "the output power is about 200 mw and the emission linewidth is about 1 mhz .",
    "the laser intensity is actively stabilized using an external single - pass acousto - optical - modulator ( aom ) ( see appendix for details on the noise spectrum ) .",
    "the two bragg beams , with frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are obtained using two separate aoms and they are coupled with mutually orthogonal polarizations into a single - mode polarization - maintaining fiber .",
    "they are collimated at an @xmath14 intensity radius of @xmath15 mm and sent vertically upwards onto the atomic sample .",
    "the light is then retro - reflected by a @xmath16 mirror suspended on a vibration isolation platform ( minusk 25bm-4 ) .",
    "a quarter - wave plate is placed before the retro - reflection mirror to rotate the polarization of the returning light by @xmath17 .",
    "this allows the beams to interfere with each other to generate two travelling waves moving in opposite directions , while the formation of standing waves by pairs of beams with the same frequency is avoided .",
    "the difference between the beams frequencies @xmath18 is adjusted in order to have the upward moving lattice drive the bragg transitions , which occur for @xmath19 in the falling frame , where @xmath20 khz is the recoil frequency for strontium atoms .",
    "the lattice moving downward is doppler shifted out of resonance during most of the atoms free - fall .",
    "bragg pulses at the apogee of the ballistic trajectories are avoided to prevent double diffraction .",
    "the verticality of the beam is verified at 1  mrad by retro - reflecting it on a water surface .",
    "the residual vibrations and tilt coupled to the retro - reflecting mirror are monitored by a triaxial accelerometer ( episensor es - t ) and a precision tiltmeter ( applied geomechanics tuff tilt 420 ) placed on top of the vibration - isolation platform ( see appendix for details on noise spectra ) .",
    "the whole platform is enclosed in an acoustic isolation box .",
    "the two bragg aoms are driven by two radio - frequency ( rf ) generators phase - locked to a 10 mhz reference signal provided by a rb clock and the pulses are shaped to have a gaussian profile @xcite using an additional signal generator that drives two variable attenuators acting on both the rf bragg signals .",
    "the phase noise of the bragg beams in this configuration was characterized with a digital phase detector by comparing the beat note of the two frequency components detected on a photodiode ( placed after the optical fiber ) with a reference rf synthesizer ( see appendix ) .    with the available optical power on the atoms of @xmath21 mw per beam ,",
    "the typical optical intensity is @xmath22",
    "mw/@xmath23 and the maximum two - photon rabi frequency estimated for gaussian pulses at a detuning @xmath24  ghz is @xmath25  khz . for different bragg orders the detuning",
    "is adjusted to maintain a high effective rabi frequency @xmath26 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the pulse duration is kept larger than @xmath27 $ ] to maintain the losses into other orders negligible @xcite and thus guarantee high @xmath28-pulse efficiencies .",
    "we set a typical effective rabi frequency @xmath29  khz , with a @xmath28 pulse duration of @xmath30  @xmath31s full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , corresponding to a fourier width larger than the atoms momentum spread . at a detuning @xmath32 ghz and full power",
    ", we obtain a diffraction efficiency of 50% for the 4^th^ order .",
    "the experimental sequence is the following : ^88^sr atoms from an atomic beam produced using a high - efficiency oven @xcite are decelerated in a zeeman slower and then trapped and cooled in a two - stage magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "the first `` blue '' mot is realized using the strong @xmath10@xmath11 transition at 461  nm to reach a temperature of 1  mk .",
    "the atoms are then further cooled in a `` red '' mot operating on the narrow intercombination @xmath10@xmath33 transition at 689 nm , reaching a final temperature of @xmath34k , with a spatial radial ( vertical ) size of @xmath35 @xmath31 m ( 50 @xmath31 m ) fwhm .",
    "the sequence produces about @xmath36 trapped atoms in @xmath37  s. a small fraction of the atoms ( @xmath38 ) is selected from the mot and launched upwards with a sequence of bragg @xmath28 pulses with a typical duration of 47  @xmath31s fwhm , up to a total momentum transfer of 40  @xmath39 .",
    "even though a single @xmath28 pulse would be sufficient to isolate the selected atoms from the freely falling cloud after the release from the red mot , a larger number of pulses is applied to increase the total time of flight up to 150  ms . by means of bragg spectroscopy",
    "@xcite we estimate a vertical momentum spread of @xmath40 fwhm for the red mot , and @xmath41 for the selected atomic sample , that allows high fidelity @xmath28 and @xmath42 pulses in the interferometer @xcite .",
    "incidentally , in this work we also performed preliminary tests of velocity selection and launch of sr atoms in a fountain using bloch oscillations in an accelerated vertical optical lattice at 532 nm .",
    "after the launch of the atoms in the fountain , a mach - zehnder interferometer is realized by applying three bragg pulses in a @xmath42@xmath28@xmath42 configuration . as shown in fig.[fig.apparatus](b ) , the first @xmath42 pulse coherently splits the atomic wavepacket over two paths separated by @xmath4 .",
    "fig.[fig.apparatus](c ) shows an image of the atoms in the two arms of the interferometer after 30 ms for a 1^st^ order pulse .",
    "the spatial separation between the two interferometer arms is 600  @xmath31 m , that is about two times larger than the separation induced by near - infrared light in alkali atom interferometers .",
    "the two paths in the interferometer are recombined after a time @xmath43 .",
    "the population in the two output ports is detected by either absorption imaging or fluorescence collection about 40  ms after the last pulse is applied , when the two momentum states are sufficiently separated in space .",
    "the interferometer time @xmath44 is currently limited by the vertical size of the vacuum chamber ( 10 cm ) which limits the total time of flight for the atoms in the fountain .",
    "the number of atoms in the two outputs @xmath45 and @xmath46 is determined by fitting the detected signal with two gaussian profiles .",
    "they oscillate periodically as a function of the relative phase @xmath47 acquired by the atoms in the two arms .",
    "the output signal of the interferometer @xmath48 is given by the relative population : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an offset and @xmath51 is the contrast . for a vertical mach - zehnder bragg interferometer ,",
    "the relative phase depends on the gravity acceleration @xmath52 , the effective laser wave number @xmath53 , the interferometer time @xmath44 and the optical phase of the bragg pulses : @xmath54 where @xmath55 khz / ms is a frequency chirping applied to the bragg beams in order to compensate for the varying doppler shift of the falling atoms , and @xmath56 is the relative phase between the two beams for the @xmath57 pulse .",
    "the contrast of the interference fringes , obtained by scanning the phase @xmath58 of the last @xmath42 pulse , was determined from the values of @xmath48 between the 2^nd^ and the 98^th^ percentile @xcite .",
    "[ fig.fringecontrast ] shows the values of the observed contrast for 1^st^ , 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ bragg order as a function of the interferometer time @xmath44 . for different orders ,",
    "the bragg laser detuning @xmath8 was chosen in order to maintain a high rabi frequency and a low rate of light scattering , according to the available laser power . for short interferometer times , the contrast is mainly limited by the velocity spread along the vertical direction and by the residual light scattering , which limits the @xmath28 pulse efficiency . for long interferometer times , the contrast is mainly limited by the rabi frequency inhomogeneity which is due to both the radial expansion of the atomic cloud and the intensity profile imperfections of the bragg beams @xcite . the sensitivity to this inhomogeneity",
    "becomes more critical as the bragg order n increases because the effective rabi frequency scales as the @xmath5^th^ power of the two - photon rabi frequency .",
    "this shows that the small sample size and the ultralow temperatures achievable with strontium atoms can lead to a high contrast for long interferometer times even with relatively narrow bragg beams .",
    "further improvement in the contrast can be obtained by reducing the probe beam size in order to only interact with the central atoms , for which the rabi frequency inhomogeneities due to the transverse expansion are smaller . however , in doing this the effect on the sensitivity has to be taken into account .",
    "reducing the interrogation area will reduce the number of interrogated atoms , leading to an increase of the shot noise limit and of detection noise .",
    "therefore , there is a trade - off between contrast gain and noise suppression which has to be optimised in order to really improve the sensitivity of the gravimeter .",
    "conversely , it is possible to explore geometries where the atoms are guided by a dipole trap along the falling axis . in this scenario",
    "the atoms could be forced to remain in the region of maximum intensity of the bragg beams , ensuring that they all contribute to the interferometer signal .",
    "a technically feasible improvement by an order of magnitude in the bragg laser power would allow us to move further from resonance ( @xmath59 ) maintaining a sufficiently high rabi frequency and therefore realize a higher - order interferometer as demonstrated for cs @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath60 of the interferometer as a gravimeter is determined by measuring the phase fluctuations @xmath61 at the slope of the central fringe : @xmath62 the short and long - term sensitivities are characterized with the allan deviation .",
    "the results for a 1^st^ order interferometer with a time @xmath63  ms and the estimated effect of the main noise sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.allan ] .",
    "the allan deviation scales as the inverse - root of the integration time with @xmath64 at 1  s , reaching @xmath65 at 2000  s. the sensitivity of our interferometer is presently limited by the residual acceleration of the suspended retro - reflection mirror .",
    "the estimated phase noise due to the mirror vibrations is 380 mrad@xmath66 where @xmath67 is the averaging time .",
    "the second major noise contribution comes from the optical phase noise of the bragg beams which is estimated to be 20 mrad@xmath66 , more than one order of magnitude smaller than the vibration noise .",
    "the calculated phase noise arising from intensity fluctuations of the bragg laser is 1 mrad@xmath66 , while other noise sources such as ac stark shift effects and bragg frequency noise are estimated to give contributions below the @xmath31rad@xmath66 level ( see appendix ) .",
    "finally , the shot noise limit for @xmath68 atoms is @xmath69 mrad@xmath66 .",
    "in conclusion , we demonstrated lmt bragg interferometry in a fountain of alkaline - earth atoms for the first time .",
    "the results are mainly limited by technical aspects such as the available laser power , the size of the vacuum cell and residual vibrations ; therefore we anticipate a dramatic increase in performance with the increasing power of available lasers , a larger chamber to increase the interferometer time and improved isolation from vibrational noise .",
    "a variation on our scheme is the possibility to induce the bragg transitions using the narrow intercombination line at 689 nm where stable lasers with a higher output power are already available .",
    "moreover , schemes based on the combination of bragg diffraction and bloch oscillations @xcite might allow superior performances in terms of precision and accuracy thanks to the specific properties of strontium .",
    "other relevant prospects are the use of ultracold sr sources @xcite and high sensitivity detection schemes beyond the classical limit @xcite . in order to surpass present limits and take full advantage of the methods and ideas discussed in this paper",
    ", we are developing a new apparatus for a large - scale ( @xmath70  10  m high ) sr fountain .",
    "possible fundamental physics experiments include stringent tests of the einstein equivalence principle and possible spin - gravity coupling @xcite , tests of models of quantum gravity @xcite and dark matter @xcite , new schemes to determine the value of the gravitational constant @xcite and the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "potential applications in geophysics and geodesy can also be envisaged @xcite .    in the long term , a space mission based on strontium atoms combining atom interferometers and transportable optical clocks",
    "@xcite together with a suitable configuration for gravitational wave detection @xcite would enable extremely high precision tests of different fundamental aspects of gravitational physics @xcite .",

    "we also acknowledge support from the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 grant agreement 250072 - `` isense '' project and grant agreement 607493 - itn `` fact '' project ) .",
    "we thank g. rosi for useful discussions .",
    "here we provide evaluation of the main noise sources limiting the sensitivity of the sr interferometer . the measured typical power spectral noise densities ( psd ) are also reported . here",
    ", all the equations for the noise estimation are written for first order bragg diffraction , @xmath71 .",
    "it must be noted that while the estimated phase noise is proportional to @xmath5 , the sensitivity of the interferometer ( @xmath60 , as given by the eq .  [ eq.sens ] ) does not depend on @xmath5 . for the evaluation ,",
    "we have considered the following typical interferometer parameter values : interferometer time @xmath63 ms , cycle time @xmath72=1.7 s and @xmath42 bragg pulse duration @xmath73s . in order to maintain simplicity in the calculations we consider bragg pulses with a square profile , although a gaussian profile is used in the experiment .",
    "what is important for the evaluation of the noise contributions is actually the pulse area @xmath74 and therefore , for @xmath75 , using different pulse shape has a negligible effect on the result .",
    "fig.[fig.noise](a ) shows the psd measurement of the bragg laser intensity noise .",
    "the estimation of phase shift induced on the interferometer by this noise follows the analysis done for raman interferometers ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the phase noise , written in terms of its allan variance , is given by the following formula : @xmath76 where the sensitivity function @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath51 is the contrast of the interferometer .",
    "for our selected values we estimate a @xmath79 mrad@xmath66 .        the psd measurement of the phase noise @xmath80 on the bragg beams is presented in fig.[fig.noise](b ) .",
    "this has been characterized through the use of a digital phase and frequency detector ( pfd ) by comparing the beatnote of the two bragg frequency components , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , to a reference rf synthesizer .",
    "the beatnote is detected on a photodiode placed after the polarization maintaining fiber ( just before the atomic sample ) .",
    "the integrated phase noise on a time scale of 100 ms is 1 mrad . under our typical conditions we estimate @xmath81 mrad@xmath66 , according to the standard formula @xcite : @xmath82[eq.sigma ]    where the transfer function @xmath83 is given , as usual , by the fourier transform of the sensitivity function @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 the sensitivity function @xmath84 for a sequence of three pulses @xmath42@xmath28@xmath42 of duration @xmath862@xmath86@xmath86 separated by a time @xmath44 with rabi frequency @xmath87 is : @xmath88 & \\mathrm{for}\\ ,   -t < t<-t+\\tau_b\\\\ 1 & \\mathrm{for}\\ ,   -t+\\tau_b < t<-\\tau_b\\\\ -\\sin [ \\omega_r t ] & \\mathrm{for } \\ , -\\tau_b < t<\\tau_b\\\\ -1 & \\mathrm{for}\\ ,   \\tau_b < t < t-\\tau_b\\\\ \\sin [ \\omega_r ( t - t ) ] & \\mathrm{for}\\ ,   t-\\tau_b < t < t\\\\ 0 & \\mathrm{for}\\ ,   t < t < t_c/2 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    another important contribution to the interferometer noise is the vibration noise , which is directly coupled to the upper retro - reflecting mirror for the bragg beams .",
    "the psd of acceleration noise @xmath89 , measured on top of the supporting minusk platform , is shown on fig.[fig.noise](c ) .",
    "the degradation to the sr interferometer sensitivity due to vibrations coupled to the retro - reflecting bragg mirror has been evaluated with the formula @xcite : @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the effective wave vector of the @xmath92 order bragg diffraction with @xmath93 nm . for our typical vibration noise , we estimated an allan deviation of @xmath94 mrad@xmath66 .",
    "this contribution sets the actual limit on our interferometer sensitivity .",
    "intensity fluctuations of the bragg laser could , in principle , induce phase noise through the ac stark shift effect .",
    "however , for bragg diffraction this effect is reduced in comparison to raman interactions , since atoms remain in the same internal state and only their momentum changes .",
    "a residual differential shift comes from the different detunings for the two momentum states through the doppler shift effect .",
    "one should therefore still expect a small contribution to phase noise proportional to the intensity fluctuation @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the bragg resonance frequency and the bragg laser detuning respectively , and @xmath98 the intensity fluctuation over the interferometer time . with our typical parameters , we estimate an induced phase noise of @xmath99rad per shot , which is negligible compared to other sources of noise .    finally , the influence of fluctuations of the absolute bragg laser wave vector has also been estimated . for this",
    ", the frequency stability of the 461 nm bragg laser has been characterized through the beatnote of the bragg laser against the master cooling laser at 461 nm .",
