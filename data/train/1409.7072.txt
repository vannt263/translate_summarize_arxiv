    "transit transmission spectroscopy is an observational technique that can be used to characterize a planet s atmosphere as it transits its host star .",
    "this technique has been used to identify absorption features in some exoplanet atmospheres @xcite , but many planets have flat , featureless spectra @xcite .",
    "flat spectra can be explained by either a high mean molecular weight ( and thus small scale height ) atmosphere or by the presence of high - altitude clouds or hazes , as is common in planets in our own solar system , and has been inferred for the atmospheres of some hot jupiters @xcite . for gj 1214b ,",
    "even high mean molecular weight atmospheres have recently been ruled out , leaving very high altitude clouds or hazes as the only physically plausible explanation for the planet s spectrum @xcite .",
    "the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and large ground based telescopes such as the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) will open up new avenues for characterizing transiting planets .",
    "absorption features for an earth - like or super - earth planet could be detected in the near future with 200 hrs of jwst in - transit observations @xcite , or with @xmath120 hrs of e - elt in - transit observations @xcite .",
    "if there are clouds or hazes present in an atmosphere , they will limit the atmospheric levels that can be probed , making the targets less desirable for characterization .",
    "therefore , it would be beneficial to have a method that could relatively rapidly discriminate between haze - free and hazy planets , which are not easily characterized even in extended transit transmission observations @xcite .    here",
    "we examine whether refractive effects on transit transmission spectroscopy could provide a more efficient way of discriminating between hazy , cloudy and clearsky ( free of clouds and hazes ) atmospheres .",
    "@xcite propose that measurements of absorption wing steepness , or a comparison of the depths of multiple absorption bands , could be used to distinguish between cloudy / hazy and clearsky planets .",
    "since both methods require relatively detailed characterization of absorption features , these techniques may not discriminate between a hazy and haze - free planet before considerable amounts of telescope time are used .",
    "in contrast , the refractive signal is independent of absorption features , and could be binned over a wide range of wavelengths , increasing detectability .",
    "while refraction can set a mid - transit maximum transit pressure ( or minimum tangent altitude ) that can be probed by transit transmission spectroscopy @xcite refraction provides the deepest probe of an atmosphere pre- and post - transit @xcite , when it also generates a refractive halo around the exoplanet , increasing the observed flux @xcite .",
    "@xcite derive analytic expressions for the halo brightness for both transparent atmospheres and atmospheres with extinction from rayleigh scattering . @xcite and",
    "@xcite examine the concept further by generating spectra of refracted light for the earth and for venus .",
    "here we expand on previous work by showing that a detection of refracted light in a transit light curve pre - ingress and post - egress would preclude hazy atmospheres , because hazes tend to obscure the layers of the atmosphere that refract light to a distant observer .",
    "we show that this signal could be more readily detectable than spectral absorption features in some cases and could be valuable for selecting targets for more extended follow - up observations .",
    "we used the refraction code that is described in detail in @xcite to calculate refraction angles for a suite of planetary atmospheres .",
    "briefly , refraction is governed by a set of differential equations that we solve at each step along the path through the atmosphere using a runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "given the planetary radius , surface gravity , atmospheric composition and pressure - temperature profile , the model calculates the angle of deflection due to refraction for a range of tangent altitudes .",
    "we generated refractive light curves to calculate the amount of out - of - transit refracted light .",
    "we first determined whether or not each portion of the atmosphere ( given as an altitude and angle along the annulus of the atmosphere ) is illuminated at each time during the transit event , from half a transit length prior to ingress to half a transit length after egress , and then integrated over the entire atmosphere to generate the light curve .",
    "we quantified the signal of refracted light as the difference in the average value of the transit light curve between two stages of the transit event .",
    "we chose a quarter of a transit length as the time bin to maximize the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) for the majority of cases we examined .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] , most of the refracted flux is seen in the quarter of a transit prior to ingress , so dividing the transit into longer stages would reduce the time - averaged signal . stages with shorter durations could increase the time - averaged signal , but would have greater noise levels because of the shorter integration time . refracted light brightness is more strongly peaked just outside of transit for planets with equilibrium temperatures ( t@xmath2 , see @xcite for definition ) @xmath1600 k , but we find that even for these cases adopting a time bin of 5% of the transit length results in poorer s / n for t@xmath3600 k and an increase in s / n by only a factor of @xmath42 for planets with greater temperatures          we used a suite of planetary atmospheres to calculate the refracted light signal .",
    "these are shown in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "we have selected a combination of solar system analogs as well possible super - earth and mini - neptune atmospheres to cover a wide range of potential planetary atmospheres .",
    "we assumed the h@xmath5-dominated atmospheres have a solar h / he ratio ( 90% h , 10% he ) for simplicity , but the small change in the refractive index for different h / he ratios should have a negligible effect on our results .",
    "for the super - earth and mini - neptune planets , we ran our models on 4 test cases to span the most likely bulk atmospheric compositions : 100% n@xmath5 , solar composition , 100% h@xmath5o , and 100% co@xmath5 .    out - of - transit refracted light",
    "must be deflected by a large enough angle to be scattered into the beam to a distant observer .",
    "the characteristic angle of deflection ( in radians ) is @xmath4r@xmath6/d , ( where r@xmath6 is the stellar radius and @xmath7 is the planet - star distance ) which is also half the angular size of the star , as seen by the planet .",
    "for example , half a transit length prior to ingress , on the trailing side of the planet , light originating at the near and far limb of the star would have to be refracted by r@xmath6/d and 3r@xmath6/d respectively , to reach a distant observer .",
    "more than half a transit length prior to ingress , the required refraction angles would increase , and closer to ingress they would decrease .    based on the qualitative description given above , the brightness of the refracted light signal depends on the angles of refraction at each altitude in an atmosphere and the planet - star geometry .",
    "the deflection of light by a planetary atmosphere can be calculated by our model from the atmospheric scale height , the planetary radius ( r@xmath8 ) , and the index of refraction of the atmosphere . for each test case ,",
    "r@xmath8 and the refractive index are given .",
    "the scale height is determined from the surface gravity , mean molecular weight of the atmosphere , and t@xmath2 .",
    "surface gravity is given for each test case , and the mean molecular weight is determined by the composition .",
    "we ran our model simulations over a grid of isothermal atmospheres with t@xmath2 from 100 to 1000 k , covering a wide range of atmospheric scale heights .",
    "we chose to use isothermal atmospheres for simplicity after testing other temperature profiles with realistic tropospheric lapse rates and stratospheric temperature inversions and finding no significant difference in our results . the planet - star geometry is determined by r@xmath8 , r@xmath6 , the impact parameter ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath7 .",
    "the impact parameter is the sky - projected distance at conjunction , in units of stellar radius @xcite . to cover the full range of planet - star geometries , we ran our simulations over a range of values for @xmath9 , planetary albedo , and stellar types from m9 to f5 , constraining the stellar radius and luminosity .",

    "to determine appropriate pressure cutoff layers for the three main aerosol cases under consideration , we used our modeling results and examples of clouds and hazes in our own solar system to select pressure cutoffs at 1 bar ( clearsky case ) , 0.1 bars ( cloudy case ) and 1 mbar ( hazy case ) .",
    "we chose 1 bar as our clearsky pressure cutoff because at pressures @xmath101 bar , our modeling indicates that atmospheres within the range of compositions under consideration are optically thick near 1 @xmath11 m ( the central wavelength for our transit simulations ) when only rayleigh scattering is included .",
    "for the pressure cut - off for cloudy atmospheres we chose 0.1 bars , which is a characteristic lower pressure limit for the tropopause for atmospheres of a range of different compositions @xcite , and the majority of clouds are found within a planet s troposphere .",
    "lastly , we chose 1 mbar as the hazy pressure cutoff because hazes are typically generated via photochemistry in the upper atmosphere at pressures near 1 mbar .",
    "for example , at 1 @xmath11 m venus is optically thick ( @xmath12=1 ) in transit transmission at 90 km ( @xmath40.1 mbar ) @xcite and titan is optically thick at @xmath4240 km ( @xmath00.5 mbar ) @xcite . because hazes form at pressures @xmath01 mbar in both a warm co@xmath5-dominated atmosphere and a cold n@xmath5-dominated atmosphere , we chose 1 mbar as a reasonable cutoff for hazes over the parameter space we explore here .",

    "overall , a detection of refracted light is indicative of a non - hazy atmosphere and , for some regions of parameter space , quantifying the refracted light flux could aid in uniquely discriminating between cloudy , hazy and clearsky atmospheres .",
    "the refracted light brightness is strongest for planets with t@xmath2 between 150 - 350 k , and is undetectable for very high temperature planets . for hot , close - in planets , the planet - star distance ( @xmath7 ) is small , meaning that the characteristic deflection angle r@xmath6/d is large , and that large refraction angles are required to produce a strong refracted light signal . for t@xmath14800 k , angles this large would require probing pressures greater than 1 bar , where most atmospheres should be opaque , meaning that atmospheric opacity results in low refracted light signals .",
    "for the coldest ( t@xmath3150 k ) planets , @xmath7 is large and the refraction angles for clearsky atmospheres are often much larger than r@xmath6/d .",
