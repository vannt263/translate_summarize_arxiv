    "dusty , or complex plasmas have grown into a mature research field with a surprisingly broad range of interdisciplinary facets @xcite . there has been significant interest in the study of dynamics of collective excitations of dusty plasmas , both in experiments @xcite and through theory / numerical simulation of strongly - coupled yukawa systems @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in these studies is theoretical modeling of longitudinal and transverse dust acoustic wave ( daw ) modes @xcite , and consequently several assessments of how the existing analytical theories compare with the results from computer experiments have appeared recently @xcite .",
    "specifically , by comparing the brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulation results for the daw spectra with various theoretical models , it was shown that the so - called quasi - localized charge approximation ( qlca ) @xcite provides an overall good account of the daw dispersion relations , i.e. , the peak locations in those spectra , for both three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) dusty plasma states characterized by the coupling strength @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 @xcite . however , since the qlca provides no information about the profile of such spectra and , consequently , gives no account of damping processes for the collective modes @xcite , it is desirable to explore alternate theoretical approaches to strongly coupled systems . in that context , generalized hydrodynamics ( gh )",
    "offers possibility to describe full wave spectra by introducing viscoelastic effects in the dynamics of dusty plasmas in a phenomenological manner , as was demonstrated in studying daws in 3d dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ordinary hydrodynamics ( oh ) , which is only valid for weakly coupled fluids with @xmath2 in the long wavelength limit , gh covers wider ranges of coupling strengths and wavelengths , where structural effects begin to show up . particularly suitable and physically intuitive framework for implementing the gh model",
    "is provided by descriptions of the lennard - jones fluids , pioneered by ailawadi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , boon and yip @xcite , and hansen and mcdonald @xcite .",
    "this framework may be applied to a dusty plasma by asserting that dust particles form a quasi - neutral fluid with the inter - particle interactions described via a debye - hckel , or yukawa potential , which arises due to screening of the charge accumulated on dust particles by the background electron and ion fluids .",
    "successful applications of the gh model to dusty plasma were conducted by kaw and sen @xcite and murillo @xcite to study the wave dispersion and the shear wave cutoff in 3d dust liquids , respectively .",
    "however , there is still great demand for a gh model for 2d strongly coupled dusty plasmas ( scdps ) , especially because such systems have become particularly favored in recent laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , our principal motivation in this work is to develop and implement a gh model for studying the collective dynamics in 2d scdps .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to generalize the gh model to include the effects of collisions of dust particles with the neutral gas in the background plasma in a manner similar to that used for colloidal suspensions in describing the collisions of macroions with the solvent molecules @xcite .",
    "while such collisions give rise to the classical brownian motion of macroparticles in both these systems , it should be stressed that the friction forces on dust particles due to the neutrals in dusty plasmas are generally much weaker than the friction forces on the colloidal macroions .",
    "accordingly , effects of the neutral gas on the daw dispersion relations are found to be negligible for the range of parameters of interest in experiments with dusty plasmas , thus validating the use of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations for such systems @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unclear as to what extent can damping due to the neutral gas compete with the viscous damping of longitudinal daws at finite frequencies and finite wavelengths in dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "while this difficult issue naturally arises in this work , our primary motivation in using bd simulation lies in the fact that treating the dust particles as brownian particles provides a natural and convenient way to eliminate the need for thermostation that arises in the md simulation of dusty plasmas @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a bd simulation of strongly coupled 2d yukawa liquids , and use the results to evaluate the equilibrium radial distribution function ( rdf ) and the static structure factor , as well as the ( power ) spectral densities for both the longitudinal and transverse current densities in such systems .",
    "the former two quantities enable us to use the gh approach within the memory function formalism to evaluate both the dispersion relation and the damping rate of the daw modes in 2d dusty plasmas by enforcing the low - order , high - frequency sum rules upon the theoretical spectral densities .",
    "it is found that the gh approach provides dispersion relations that compare well with those resulting from the simulation spectra over broad ranges of wavelengths and coupling strengths .",
    "additional comparison with the dispersion relations from the qlca model shows that the gh approach provides a good account of the direct thermal effect at lower coupling strengths and shorter wavelengths , which is absent in the qlca approach , but is seen in the simulation data . on the other hand , a simple extension of the qlca dispersion relation , which was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is found to be in a much better agreement with both the gh results and simulation data .",
    "most importantly , the gh results are shown to yield a good fit to the spectral density profiles from our bd simulations , thus providing semi - analytical modeling of the wave - number dependent damping rates of the daw modes in strongly coupled dusty plasmas in a broad range of coupling strengths , an issue that has not been fully addressed so far @xcite .",
    "finally , we also find that the effect of collisions with the neutrals on the daw damping rates is well accounted for by introducing a local in time friction force into the gh equations .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the details of the bd simulation are given in section 2 .",
    "theoretical development of the generalized hydrodynamics is discussed in section 3 .",
    "results based on two simple models for the memory function are presented in section 4 , while we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we perform bd simulation of a 2d system consisting of @xmath3 dust particles , each carrying a constant charge @xmath4 , which are initially placed at random positions within a square simulation cell in the @xmath5 plane with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "evolution of the system is governed by equations that may be regarded as a stochastic generalization of the usual md method , where the effect of collisions with the neutral particles in the background plasma is modeled by a langevin generalization of the usual newton s equations .",
    "therefore , equations for the velocity and the position vectors of the @xmath6-th dust particle are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of each dust particle and @xmath9 is the pair - wise force between two dust particles a distance @xmath10 apart , interacting via the yukawa potential , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the debye screening length of electrons and ions in the background plasma .",
    "collisions of the @xmath6-th dust particle with the neutrals in the plasma give rise to a systematic drag force , which we model by the epstein drag coefficient @xmath13 , and to a cumulative random force , which we model by a delta - correlated gaussian white noise .",
    "when the system is in thermal equilibrium , the friction coefficient @xmath13 and the stochastic acceleration of the @xmath6-th particle @xmath14 are related to the ambient temperature @xmath15 via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "equations ( [ langevin ] ) are solved for our system by the gear - like predictor - corrector algorithm for bd simulation @xcite , which was previously used in modeling both the equilibrium structure @xcite and collective modes in 2d dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ langevin ] ) can be expressed in terms of just three parameters @xcite : the coupling strength @xmath16 , the reduced neutral drag coefficient @xmath17 , and the screening parameter @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the average inter - particle separation with @xmath20 being the average surface density of dust particles , and @xmath21 is the characteristic dust - plasma frequency . in this work , we perform bd simulations using @xmath22 ( which is a value chosen as a matter of convenience only ) and @xmath23 = 1 as standard values , in a range of coupling strengths @xmath24 covering liquid - to - crystalline states of dusty plasma @xcite .",
    "further , the current density of dust particles is defined as @xmath25 with the fourier transform of its cartesian component @xmath26 given by @xmath27 assuming that the dust collective modes propagate along the @xmath28-direction , i.e. , @xmath29 , we let @xmath30 or @xmath31 , allowing us to define the corresponding longitudinal or transverse current density auto - correlation functions as @xmath32 where the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging over the initial time .",
    "the longitudinal / transverse spectral densities are then obtained as the fourier transform of the respective current density auto - correlation functions as , @xmath33 the fourier transforms defined in eq .",
    "( [ power_spectrum ] ) are evaluated using fast fourier transform from simulation data .",
    "an equivalent and useful definition of the spectral densities , to be used later , is given as the real part of the laplace transform @xcite of the current density auto - correlation functions , @xmath34\\}_{s = i\\omega}. \\label{laplace_power}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the basic approach we will take in the development of a gh model for a 2d dusty plasma is to treat the dust system as a compressible , viscous neutral fluid of particles interacting via the yukawa potential , analogous to the way how molecules in a lennard - jones fluid interact @xcite . in that context",
    ", we note that the oh approach provides a satisfactory account of the long - time ( or low - frequency ) response of a fluid in the weak coupling regime by means of the familiar naiver - stokes equation , in which viscous effects are treated as instantaneous ( or local in time ) internal friction force , related to fast thermalization of dust particles due to their mutual collisions .",
    "however , as the coupling strength increases , the effect of `` caging '' sets in , so that individual dust particles are temporarily trapped in potential wells that migrate through the system on a slow time scale , similar to the picture invoked in the qlca model . therefore , the short - time ( or high - frequency ) response of the system is dominated by elastic effects due to the restoring forces on dust particles in the itinerant potential wells . in the gh approach to the naiver - stokes equation , a transition from the purely viscous , fluid - like behavior to the elastic response of a solid - like system",
    "is described by postulating a non - local ( in time ) friction with a memory function characterized by relaxation time @xmath35 , such that the limit of a viscous fluid is recovered at times @xmath36 , whereas the solid - like elastic effects are dominant at times @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to the collisions among dust particles , it is necessary to include in the gh approach also the effect of their repeated collisions with the neutral molecules in the background plasma .",
    "these collisions may be treated as a gaussian white noise , giving rise to a picture of brownian motion , where each dust particle is subject to a local ( in time ) friction force with the neutral drag coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "we note that for typical dusty plasmas one expects @xmath38 . on the other hand , at times @xmath39 , the brownian motion of dust particles due to the neutrals",
    "may be considered as ballistic .",
    "therefore , it is justified to ignore the effect of neutral drag at the time scale @xmath40 where viscoelastic effects dominate due to interactions among the dust particles @xcite . on the other hand , at long times , such that @xmath41 , both the viscous drag and the neutral drag on dust particles may be treated by means of two additive , local in time friction forces in a generalized navier - stokes equation because the underlying physical mechanisms of energy dissipation are statistically independent .",
    "therefore , we first ignore the neutral drag and introduce a memory function formalism , which incorporates the effects of viscous relaxation into the short - time dynamics of the dust collective modes by enforcing high - frequency sum rules upon the power spectral densities of such modes @xcite .",
    "the even - order sum rules are defined in terms of the corresponding frequency moments as @xmath42 whereas all odd moments of frequency vanish since @xmath43 are even functions of @xmath44 .",
    "for example , the zeroth - order sum rule is given by @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dust thermal speed .",
    "a connection with microscopic properties of the system is accomplished by expressing , e.g. , the second moments of frequency for the longitudinal and transverse collective modes in eq.([second_sum ] ) with @xmath47 in terms of the rdf of the dust layer , @xmath48 , respectively as @xcite @xmath49\\frac{\\partial^2u(r)}{\\partial x^2 } , \\label{second_moment_rdf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50\\frac{\\partial^2u(r)}{\\partial y^2}. \\label{second_moment_transverse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    once the initial - value properties of the relevant memory functions are fixed by enforcing the sum rules in eqs.([first_sum ] ) and ( [ second_sum ] ) , one may incorporate the effect of the neutral drag by simply adding a local dissipative force into the fluid equations of motion @xcite , as explained in section [ neutral ] .",
    "the starting point for the extension of oh to gh is given by the linearized continuity equation and the navier - stokes equation , which may be written for the longitudinal and transverse dust current densities as @xcite @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the isothermal compressibility , @xmath55 is defined as the longitudinal viscosity , with @xmath56 being related to the shear viscosity and @xmath57 to the bulk viscosity , @xmath20 is the average surface density , @xmath58 is a small perturbation in density , and @xmath59 is a small perturbation to the longitudinal / transverse current density , assumed to be zero on average .    inserting the integral of eq .",

    "we have then shown that the memory function formalism of the theory of generalized hydrodynamics provides good semi - analytic results to model these wave modes .",
    "in particular , following the approach of boon and yip@xcite , we have developed an exponential model for the viscosity memory functions that satisfies the second frequency sum rule with the relaxation time being used as a fitting parameter . with such exponential model",
    "we have obtained good fits to the simulation data for the longitudinal dispersion curves over a wide range of coupling strengths , @xmath24 , as well as reasonable match with the spectral density profiles for several values of the wave - number @xmath97 .",
    "next , we have extended the theory in a straightforward manner to satisfy the third and fourth frequency sum rules , providing a parameter - free gaussian model for the viscosity memory function .",
    "the results using this model provided a successful test for our choice of the relaxation time in the exponential model in modeling both the dispersion relations and the spectral density profiles .",
    "moreover , we pointed out that the limits of an infinitely long and infinitesimally short relaxation times in the exponential model represent two parameter - free models that are fully determined by the equilibrium radial distribution function and the static structure factor of the system .",
    "it was then shown that these two limits provide good upper and lower bounds for the thermal noise observed in the simulation spectra for the longitudinal mode .",
    "comparisons of the dispersion relations obtained from these two limits of the exponential model with the dispersion relations obtained from both the quasi - localized charge approximation ( qlca ) and the extended qlca ( eqlca ) showed that the limit of an infinitely long relaxation time reproduces remarkably well all the features of the eqlca model , including the direct thermal effect . on the other hand , the limit of an infinitesimally short relaxation time was found to reproduce the near - vanishing of the dispersion relation , which is seen in the simulation spectra at certain short wave - lengths for large coupling strengths , but is not reproduced by the qlca group of results .",
    "in addition , we have also tested the memory function formalism within the theory of generalized hydrodynamics against the simulation results obtained for transverse wave modes at the coupling strength of @xmath139 , and found that the exponential model with relaxation time used as a fitting parameter can provide a reasonable estimate for the wave dispersion relation , including the appearance of a cutoff wave - number .",
    "both the peak positions and the widths in the spectral density profiles from the simulation were well reproduced by the exponential model at long wavelengths , whereas the broadening of these spectra at short wavelengths was better echoed by the gaussian model .",
    "the most important finding of the present analysis is that the wave - number dependent damping rates , which were extracted from the simulation spectra , were found in good agreement with the results from both the exponential and gaussian models , testifying to the strengths and potentials of using the memory - function formalism within the gh theory in describing the damping of the longitudinal dust acoustic wave in strongly - coupled dusty plasmas .",
    "finally , we have included the effect of neutral drag due to the collisions of dust particle with neutral molecules in the background plasma via a ( local in time ) drag coefficient .",
    "while we did not find that the neutral drag affects our modeling of dispersion relations for both the longitudinal and transverse waves in any significant way , the overall damping rates for the longitudinal wave showed possibly important roles of the neutral drag at long wavelengths and high coupling strengths where viscous damping is expected to be reduced .",
    "this aspect of the gh theory shall be studied in future work .    in conclusion",
    ", the memory function formalism of the generalized hydrodynamics provides a very promising route to analytical modeling of spectral density of collective modes in strongly coupled 2d dusty plasmas and , in particular it demonstrates a good account of viscoelastic effects which are not well described by other analytical methods .",

    "we extend here the development outlined by boon and yip @xcite by introducing the third and fourth frequency sum rules into the gh theory of spectral density .",
