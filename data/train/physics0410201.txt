    "the interaction of an intense ultrashort laser pulse with underdense plasmas has attracted much interest for a compact accelerator . using intense laser systems ,",
    "of which peak powers exceed 10 tw , electrons with energies greater than 100 mev have been observed in various low density range , of which electron densities are from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand , using terawatt class ti : sapphire laser systems , electrons with energies greater than several mega - electron - volts have been observed from moderately underdense plasmas , of which densities are up to near the quarter - critical density@xcite . at the moderately underdense plasmas ,",
    "the electron energies exceed the maximum energies determined by dephasing length .",
    "it is considered recently that the acceleration occurs by the direct laser acceleration@xcite that includes stochastic or chaotic processes .    in this paper , we study the propagation of the laser pulses and the generation of high energy electron in the underdense plasmas using two dimensional particle - in - cell ( 2d pic ) simulations .",
    "the laser power @xmath2 beyond the critical power @xmath3 is necessary because self - focusing is important in a long - distance propagation@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron density and critical density , respectively .",
    "we assume a terawatt class ti : sapphire laser system as a compact laser system in the simulations parameter , because the plasma electron densities @xmath7 .",
    "we use the 2d pic simulation with immobile ions . the peak irradiated intensity , pulse length , and spot size are @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 fs , and 3.6 @xmath11 m , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 tw , namely the energy is @xmath13 mj , when cylindrical symmetry is assumed , although we use two dimensional cartesian coordinates . the rayleigh length @xmath14 m .",
    "the plasma electron densities @xmath7 , which correspond to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 for the wavelength @xmath17",
    ". these parameters of the simulations are almost the same as the experiments of compact laser system@xcite .",
    "the laser power @xmath12 tw exceeds the critical powers @xmath3 of the relativistic self - focusing for @xmath18 .    figures 1(a)-(e ) show the intensities of laser pulses after propagating @xmath19 for electron densities @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively . for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , namely , @xmath24 , the pulses stably propagate without modulation .",
    "electrons with energies greater than 2 mev are hardly observed . for @xmath25@xmath26 , the back of pulse",
    "is modulated .",
    "electrons get energies greater than 20 mev , as shown later . for @xmath27@xmath26 ,",
    "a pulse separates into the bunches of which size about the plasma wavelength .",
    "a pulse breaks up and is not propagate stably any longer , for @xmath28@xmath26 , i.e. @xmath29 .    the electron energy spectra for electron densities @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are shown in figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) , respectively . the maximum energy is greater than @xmath32 mev for @xmath33 .",
    "before the pulses propagate about one and two rayleigh length , the maximum electron energies have been saturated at 20 mev and 10 mev for @xmath22 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we study the propagation of the intense laser pulses and the generation of high energy electrons from the moderately underdense plasmas using 2d pic simulations . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the laser pulse of which power and pulse length are @xmath36 tw and @xmath10 fs stably propagates with modulation . as a result ,",
    "the high energy electrons with energies greater than 20 mev are observed and their energies have not been saturated , namely , electrons can gain higher energies propagating with the intense laser pulse through long size plasmas . for @xmath37 , although the pulses stably propagate , no high energy electron is observed . on the other hand , for @xmath38 , high energy electrons with energies up to 20 mev are observed , although pulses does not propagate stably .",
    "the simulation results of the dependence to the plasma density of the maximum electron energy explain the latest experiment well qualitatively@xcite .",
    "in the simulations , the maximum propagation distance is @xmath39 is limited by the performance of the computer and simulation code .",
    "since the pulse has propagated sufficiently stably to @xmath19 for the plasma densities less than @xmath40@xmath26 , simulations with a longer propagation distance is required .",
