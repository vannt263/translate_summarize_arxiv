    "the soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , sometimes referred to as `` x - ray novae '' , are low - mass x - ray binary systems in which a late - type star loses material via an accretion disc to a neutron star or black hole .",
    "they undergo brief outbursts , typically lasting a few months with a recurrence time of the order of decades ( see tanaka & shibazaki 1996 and van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 for reviews of their x - ray and optical properties ) .",
    "the x - ray transient v616 mon ( = a062000 ) was discovered in 1975 ( elvis et al . , 1975 ) .",
    "when the system faded into quiescence the binary nature of the system was established ; the orbital period was determined to be 7.75 h and the secondary star was found to be a k dwarf ( oke 1977 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "mcclintock & remillard ( 1986 ) then went on to measure the orbital radial velocity curve of the secondary star , thereby obtaining a firm _ minimum _ mass for the compact object ( i.e. the mass function ) of 3.08 .",
    "this result immediately placed v616 mon amongst the best black hole candidates ( see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "high resolution optical spectroscopy can provide further constraints on the system masses , as a measurement of the rotational broadening of the secondary star absorption features leads directly to the _ ratio _ of the component masses ( mrw ) .",
    "but the binary inclination , can only be determined by exploiting the ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star , i.e. the variations caused by observing the differing aspects of the gravitationally distorted star as it orbits the compact object ( see shahbaz , naylor & charles 1993 and references within ) . in v616 mon these variations have been observed at both optical ( mcclintock & remillard 1986 ; haswell et al .",
    "1993 ) and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths ( shahbaz , naylor & charles 1994 ; hereafter snc ) .",
    "snc determined the binary inclination for v616 mon by modelling the ir ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star .",
    "they obtained @xmath2 , which when combined with the value for the binary mass function and mass ratio resulted in a most probable mass for the compact object of @xmath310 ( 5.117.1 ; 90 percent confidence ) .",
    "there are several complications in such a determination of the binary inclination ; inevitably the optical light from the mass donor is diluted by the flux from the quiescent accretion disc .",
    "also , the ellipsoidal light curve may be distorted by other variable contributions to the observed flux ; such as the bright spot , star spots and variable disc emission including the superhump phenomenon . underestimating the diluting flux leads to an underestimate in the binary inclination . at optical wavelengths",
    "it is clear that the accretion disc contributes a significant amount of flux to the optical light curves , which makes any interpretation of these light curves somewhat dubious .",
    "this can be seen from the scatter and asymmetric maxima observed in the optical light curves of v616 mon by mcclintock & remillard ( 1986 ) .",
    "the veiling by the continuum emission from the accretion disc has been measured by mrw .",
    "they find that 94 percent or more of the optical flux close to h@xmath4 comes from the secondary star , a fraction which rises with increasing wavelength , while the veiling ratio falls",
    ". therefore one would expect the veiling by the accretion disc to be very small or even negligible in the @xmath0 band .",
    "haswell et al . ( 1993 ) attempted to deduce the binary inclination from modelling their optical multi - colour light curves with a combination of an ellipsoidal variation and a grazing eclipse , assuming a large circular disk .",
    "the inclination derived from the grazing eclipse constraint is in serious disagreement with that determined from the ellipsoidal variations in the ir light curves ( snc ) .",
    "however , it is known that in low - mass x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables the outer , cool regions of the accretion disc can be a strong source of ir radiation ( e.g. beall et al .",
    "1984 ; berriman , szkody & capps 1985 ) .",
    "consequently , this introduces doubts on the snc assumption that the observed ir flux has very little contamination by the accretion disc .",
    "this would then imply that any interpretation of the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star in the ir might be misleading .",
    "nevertheless , for the sxt v404 cyg we have already shown directly that the ir accretion disc contamination is small ; it only affects the implied mass of the black hole by at most 2 ( shahbaz et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore decided to obtain through ir spectroscopy a direct measurement of any contamination of the ir flux by the accretion disc in v616 mon . from this",
    "we can determine the effect it has on the interpretation of the ellipsoidal variation of the secondary star , and hence on the component masses .",
    "we obtained @xmath0-band ( 2.02.5@xmath5 ) spectra of v616 mon using the cooled grating spectrometer ( cgs4 ) on the united kingdom 3.8-m infrared telescope on mauna kea , during the night of 1997 november 13 .",
    "the 40 l / mm grating was used with the 150 mm camera and the 256@xmath6256 pixel insb array .",
    "the bright star bs2233 was also observed through - out the night in order to remove telluric atmospheric features .",
    "a journal of observations is presented in table 1 .    in order to minimise the effects of bad pixels ,",
    "the standard procedure of oversampling was used .",
    "the spectra were sampled over two pixels by mechanically shifting the array in 0.5 pixel steps in the dispersion direction , giving a full width half maximum resolution of 47 (@xmath3610 at 2.31@xmath5 ) .",
    "we employed the non - destructive readout mode of the detector in order to reduce the readout noise .",
    "the slit width was 1.2 arcseconds which corresponds to 2 pixels on the detector . in order to compensate for the fluctuating atmospheric emission lines we took relatively short exposures and nodded the telescope primary so that the object spectrum switched between two different spatial positions on the detector . throughout the observing run the slit orientation was north to south in the spatial direction .",
    "the cgs4 data reduction system performs the initial reduction of the 2d images .",
    "these steps include the application of the bad pixel mask , bias and dark subtraction , flat field division , interlacing integrations taken at different detector positions , and co - adding and subtracting the nodded images ( see daly & beard 1994 ) .",
    "extraction of the 1d spectra , wavelength calibration , and removal of the telluric atmospheric features was then performed using iraf .",
    "a more detailed description of the data reduction procedure is provided in shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "first the individual spectra of v616 mon were averaged using the variance in the spectrum as the weight .",
    "this resulted in a final summed spectrum which had a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath3 30 .",
    "we then cross correlated all the summed v616 mon spectrum with the template star spectrum in order to determine the velocity shift .",
    "given the poor resolution of the data this was not done on the individual spectra of v616 mon before they were averaged .",
    "we applied the appropriate velocity shift and then binned all the spectra onto a uniform velocity scale .",
    "figure 1 shows the summed spectrum of v616 mon and the k3v template star spectrum , normalised and shifted for clarity .",
    "the v616 mon spectrum shows the cai triplet and @xmath7co bands in absorption and doubled - peaked br@xmath8 in emission .",
    "the peak separation of the br@xmath8 emission line arising from the accretion disc is 1204@xmath9156 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "note that this is comparable with the peak - to - peak separation in the h@xmath4 and h@xmath11 emission lines ( mrw ) .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of br@xmath8 in the k3v star spectrum is -1.6@xmath90.3 whereas in the residual spectrum [ i.e. the spectrum of the accretion disc ; see figure 1 and section 3 ] it is 14.6@xmath91.3 .",
    "the @xmath7co bands are the strongest features and will be used in the next section to determine the fraction of light arising from the secondary star .",
    "we first binned the v616 mon and template star spectra onto a logarithmic wavelength scale using a @xmath12 interpolation scheme to minimize data smoothing ( stover et al .",
    "we then optimally subtracted the template star from the v616 mon spectra using the standard procedure ( see mrw ) as follows . taking the accretion disc contribution as a flat continuum",
    ", we fit the v616 mon spectra with this plus a variable fraction of the template star .",
    "the fraction of light from the template star , ( @xmath13 ) , is adjusted to minimise the residual scatter between the spectra .",
    "the scatter is measured by carrying out the subtraction and then computing the between the residual spectrum and a smoothed version of the residual spectrum .",
    "this is done to remove any large - scale structure .",
    "the for different fractions of the template star is computed and fitted with a parabola , and the fraction at the minimum value of is taken to be the best fit .",
    "the above analysis was performed only on the 2.292@xmath5 @xmath7co(2,0 ) bandhead in the summed spectrum of v616 mon .",
    "other bandheads were not used because of poor atmospheric subtraction and bad pixels .",
    "figure 1 shows the summed spectra of v616 mon along with the template k3v star . the residual light spectrum ( i.e. the accretion disc light ) is also shown .",
    "in addition to using hd42606 ( k3v ) we also used template stars of other spectral types [ hd42606 ( k0v ) , hd42606 ( k5v ) and hd42606 ( k7v ) ] in order to determine the sensitivity of @xmath13 to the assumed spectral type .",
    "we find that for the summed spectra of v616 mon , the minimum value for ( 1.01 , a good fit ) is obtained using the k3v secondary star , which contributes 75@xmath917 percent of the flux in the ir ( the disc fraction is 25 per cent ) .",
    "we also fitted the region used in the v616 mon spectrum for the optimal subtraction with a constant and obtained a much worse fit with a of 2.7 thereby showing that the absorption feature is real as the 99.9 per cent level .",
    "the large uncertainties we obtain for the accretion disc light suggest that our result is consistent with the secondary star contributing all the light to the observed flux . in order to determine a lower limit to the fraction of light from the secondary",
    ", we simulated a spectrum in which _ all _ the light arises from the secondary star .",
    "this was done using the k3v template star and adding noise to the data such that the signal - to - noise was the same as the v616 mon spectrum .",
    "we then performed the optimal subtraction and determined the 2-@xmath1 per cent lower limit to the fraction of light arising from the secondary to be 73 per cent .",
    "this value is comparable with the fraction of light arising from the secondary star deduced from our spectrum of v616 mon , suggesting v616 mon most probably contains a companion star which contributes all the light in the ir .",
    "the quiescent optical light curves of v616 mon show a double - humped ellipsoidal modulation due to the changing projected area of the roche - lobe filling mass donor star .",
    "maxima occur at quadrature , corresponding to maximum projected area , and are hence expected to be symmetric .",
    "minima occur at orbital conjunctions ; in general they have differing depths due to limb- and gravity - darkening .",
    "the light from the secondary star is diluted by the flux from the accretion disc .",
    "also the ellipsoidal light curve may be distorted by other variable contributions to the total light ; the bright spot associated with the impact of the mass transfer stream on the edge of the disc ( mcclintock & remillard 1990 ) ; star spots on the secondary ; and variable disc emission , including the superhump phenomenon ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "recently leibowitz , herman & orio ( 1998 ) have collated the optical light curves of v616 mon obtained over the last 7 years .",
    "they find that the depth of the maxima and minima of the light curves vary with time .",
    "they observe a long term photometric behaviour of a few hundred days with a peak to peak amplitude of 0.3 mag .",
    "they suggest that the minimum in the light curve corresponding to when the red dwarf lies between the observer and the compact object ( orbital phase 0.0 ) changes depth with time .",
    "since in the standard precessing disc model one does not expect this minimum to change depth significantly ( as at this phase the secondary star is least affected by x - ray illumination ) they conclude that they can not explain the variations in terms of a simple geometrical precessing accretion disc model ( heemskerk & van paradijs 1989 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the main thrust of their conclusion lies in the interpretation of the varying component in the light curves . in the precessing disc model",
    "the depth of either minimum can vary with time , depending on the tilt of the accretion disc ( heemskerk and van paradijs 1989 ) .",
    "also they have assumed that the maximum in the light curve ( orbital phase 0.75 ) with respect to which the minima is measured remains constant .",
    "this is probably not the case as the observed optical light near this orbital phase is contaminated by the bright spot .",
    "optical spectroscopy of v616 mon shows the presence of a bright spot ( mrw ) .",
    "bright spots have been seen in the optical light curves of cataclysmic variables with similar mass ratios such as z cha and oy car ( wood et al .",
    "1986 , 1989 ) where it is observed between orbital phase 0.6 and 1.1 .",
    "variations in the optical flux emitted by the bright spot as the result of clumpy mass transfer from the secondary star could easily give rise to variability in the optical flux observed at this orbital phase .",
    "in the ir the effects of the variability discussed above are much less ( snc ) .",
    "the ir light curve of v616 mon shows equal maxima ; this is what is expected if the ir variations are due solely to the ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star .",
    "various authors have pointed out that the double - peaked emission line profiles can be interpreted as arising from an accretion disk viewed at high inclination .",
    "however , it should be noted that a double - peaked emission line profile can also arise from a system with an inclination as low as 15@xmath14 ( see the models of horne & marsh 1986 ) .",
    "assuming that the double - peaked lines arise entirely from the disk , we can estimate the binary inclination of v616 mon by measuring the separation of the br@xmath8 emission - line peaks .",
    "the keplerian velocity of the outer edge of the disk ( @xmath15 ) is given by @xmath16 .",
    "combining this with kepler s third law , paczynski s ( 1971 ) formula for the roche lobe radius , and using the fact that the accretion disk fills 50 per cent of the compact object s roche - lobe ( mrw ) , gives @xmath17 km s@xmath10 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the black hole ( in solar masses ) , and @xmath19 is the orbital period ( in hours ) .",
    "the separation of the br@xmath8 emission - line peaks measured from the summed spectrum of v616 mon is 1204 km  s@xmath10 , implying a projected velocity of the outer edge of the accretion disk of @xmath20 602 km  s@xmath10 . using the above formula with @xmath19=7.75 hrs",
    "( mrw ) and @xmath21 ( snc ) gives a @xmath22 , which agrees well with that obtained by snc .",
    "in cataclysmic variables there is observational evidence that the accretion disc contamination in the @xmath0-band is significant .",
    "the eclipse light curves of the dwarf nova oy car , for example show that during quiescence the accretion disc can contribute about 30 percent of the flux at 2.2@xmath5 ( sherrington et al .",
    "ir spectra of cataclysmic variables also show emission lines arising from the optically thin gas in the accretion disc ( ramseyer et al .",
    "1993 ; dhillon & marsh 1995 ) , such as hei ( 2.0587@xmath5 ) and br@xmath8 ( 2.1655@xmath5 ) .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray transients v404 cyg ( shahbaz et al . 1996 ) and v616 mon show only br@xmath8 in emission .",
    "it should also be noted that the mass accretion rate during quiescence in the x - ray transients is a factor of 10 lower than that in dwarf novae .",
    "one expects the ew of the emission lines arising from the accretion disc to decrease as the orbital period of the binary increases .",
    "this is simply because larger systems will have larger , cooler accretion discs .",
    "if one looks at the h@xmath4 ew in the sxts , then one can find some evidence for this type of correlation ; for nova per 1992 the h@xmath4 ew is 205 , whereas for the larger systems such as nova mus 1991 and v404 cyg it is 50  and 40   rrespectively . also note that in all the sxts the disc contamination near h@xmath4 is in the range 6 - 16 percent , i.e. it is small despite the large h@xmath4 ew . in v404",
    "cyg the br-@xmath8 ew of the accretion disc is 2.7 .",
    "one expects the br-@xmath8 ew of the accretion disc in the much shorter system v616 mon to be higher ; this is what is observed ( see section 2 ) .",
    "snc obtained an ir light curve of v616 mon which showed a double humped feature characteristic of the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star .",
    "they modelled these variations assuming all the ir flux was arising from the secondary star , and determined the most probable mass of the compact object to be 10 .",
    "justification for this assumption comes from the analysis of the ir light curve of the transient cen x4 ( shahbaz et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the mass of the compact object in cen x4 is consistent with that of a canonical neutron star ; which the compact object must be because of the type i x - ray bursts observed during outburst ( matsuoka et al .",
    "this provides indirect evidence that the contribution of the accretion disc to the observed ir flux is very small , at least from cen x4 .",
    "this may also be the case for v616 mon ; an upper limit to the accretion disc contribution to the ir flux being 27 percent ( section 3 ) .",
    "the effects of any accretion disc contamination to the observed ir flux will be to dilute the actual ellipsoidal modulation , making the observed modulation smaller than the _ true _ value . since the amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulation",
    "is correlated with the binary inclination ( large amplitudes imply a high binary inclination ) , this means that modelling a contaminated light curve will underestimate @xmath23 .",
    "we have modelled the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "we used the same parameters as snc : t@xmath24=4000 k , @xmath25=14.9 ( mrw ) , a gravity darkening exponent of 0.08 ( lucy 1967 ) , and the limb darkening coefficient from al - naimiy ( 1978 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the effect of differing amounts of contamination in the ir light curves on the binary inclination . if we take the 2-@xmath1 limit to the disc contamination of 27 percent , we find that @xmath23 increases by 7 degrees and the mass of the black hole decreases by 3.6 ( 2-@xmath1 limit ) .",
    "note that this extreme value for @xmath23 is still lower than that obtained by haswell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and the implied mass of the compact object ( @xmath3 6.4 ) still substantially exceeds the canonical maximum mass of a neutron star ( 3.2 ; rhoades & ruffini 1974 ) .",
    "we have determined the contamination of the observed ir flux by the accretion disk in v616 mon .",
    "we obtained ir spectra of v616 mon which when optimally subtracted from the secondary star spectrum ( k3v star ) allows us to determine the 2-@xmath1 upper limit to the accretion disc contribution to be less than 27 percent .",
    "we find that this only increases the determination of the binary inclination by less than 7 degrees ; the mass of the black hole is decreased by less than 3.6 .",
    "we would like to thank t. geballe for useful discussions .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the iraf and ark software packages .",
    "the united kingdom infrared telescope is operated by the royal observatories on behalf of the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ."
