    "known for thirty years @xcite , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) were conventionally classified as those seyfert 1 galaxies having full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of h@xmath0 lower than 2000 km s@xmath3 @xcite and showing the flux ratio between [ oiii]@xmath15007 and the total ( broad plus narrow ) h@xmath0 smaller than 3 @xcite .",
    "most of them are also characterized by emission of strong feii multiplets , [ fevii]@xmath16087 and [ fex]@xmath16374 , and in some cases also by [ fexi]@xmath17892 and [ fexiv]@xmath15303 @xcite .",
    "in addition , nls1s show a steep soft x - ray slope , rapid and large soft x - ray variability @xcite , a weak big blue bump in the optical / uv range , bright ir emission @xcite , and nuclear super - solar metallicity .",
    "some nls1s show also radio and gamma - ray emission , signs of the presence of a relativistic jet .",
    "nls1s are generally believed to be powered by less massive black holes ( bhs ) than classic broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( bls1s ) and accreting up to the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is likely that nls1s are a young phase of bls1s @xcite . notwithstanding all these established properties",
    ", some questions still remain unsolved .",
    "models by @xcite suggest that nls1s are expected to have broad - line region ( blr ) lines with lorentzian profiles caused by a macroscopic turbulent motion of gaseous clouds , which , especially at large radii , contributes significantly to the line wings . at the same time , showed that the profiles of permitted lines in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) consist mainly of rotationally broadened lorentzian functions . in the past , other authors favored a fitting with a single lorentzian function .",
    "however , there is no consensus on this topic , also because it is still debated whether a lorentzian function is the most appropriate representation of the line profile , since a double gaussian , or even a multi - gaussian approach seemed to provide a more statistically robust fitting ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "strong multiplets of feii are often detected in nls1s spectra .",
    "the excitation mechanism of these spectral lines is still uncertain .",
    "photoionization models can not easily account for strong feii emission @xcite , since the region emitting these multiplets is a weakly ionized part of the blr . assuming a high over - abundance of iron also",
    "does not reproduce the intensity of the multiplets @xcite .",
    "shocks induced by winds and/or outflows have been invoked to heat the gas and cause the collisional excitation of the upper energy levels of the feii transitions .",
    "feii emission could depend on the physical conditions of the low - ionization clouds of the blr which emits also oi@xmath18446 , and caii@xmath18498,8542,8662 ( hereafter cat ) .",
    "indeed , the ionization potentials of oi and caii ( 13.6 and 11.9 ev , respectively ) are close to that of feii ( 16.2 ev ) .",
    "these lines are not yet extensively studied likely because of their proximity to the nir domain , which requires spectroscopic infrared observations when the redshift is larger than 0.1 .",
    "cat is a transition onto a metastable triplet produced by collisional excitation and likely emitted by a high - density , optically - thick neutral gas @xcite .",
    "oi@xmath18446 can be emitted in less extreme conditions @xcite , but its origin is not yet completely understood .",
    "the oi@xmath18446 line is generally believed to be produced by ly-@xmath0 fluorescence , that excites electrons from level 2p@xmath5 3p to the higher level 3d 3d@xmath6 .",
    "the other possible physical processes are collisional excitation and recombination .",
    "their contribution to oi@xmath18446 can be evaluated on the basis of the presence and intensity of oi@xmath17774 .",
    "the ratio 7774/8446 is expected to be @xmath70.3 in case of collision @xcite , while it should be @xmath71.1 in case of recombination @xcite . a comparison among the kinematics of feii , oi and cat in uv , optical and nir has been recently used to discuss the site of the feii emitting region , which seems to be the same of oi and cat @xcite and located in an outer part of the blr with respect to hydrogen @xcite . on the contrary , reverberation - mapping analyses of a small number of agns suggest that both feii and hydrogen lines are produced by the same ionized gas @xcite .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies , and nls1 in particular , are known to show often blue asymmetric profiles in their [ oiii]@xmath8 emission lines @xcite .",
    "these profiles consist mainly of two components : 1 ) a narrow _ core _ component ( fwhm@xmath7200500 kms@xmath3 ) , believed to be emitted by gas located far from the active nucleus and whose kinematics is dominated by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy , as shown by @xcite ; 2 ) a broad component ( fwhm@xmath75001000 kms@xmath3 ) , called _ wing _ , believed to be emitted by gas located closer to the active nucleus and whose width is dominated by turbulent outflows in a direction perpendicular to the accretion disk .",
    "furthermore , in some agns the high ionization emission lines show a systematic difference in velocity when compared to the low ionization lines .",
    "first detected by @xcite in izw1 , this effect was studied more recently by several authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". agns with [ oiii ] showing a velocity shift of @xmath9 km s@xmath3 with respect to h@xmath0 were called _",
    "blue outliers _ by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite applied a less - restrictive upper limit of @xmath10 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this blueshift could be due to an outflow associated with a disk wind @xcite , or with a hot decelerating wind @xcite combined with a source of opacity .",
    "@xcite found that also the high - ionization lines of blr , and in particular civ line , are blueshifted by about 600 kms@xmath3 with respect to the rest - frame . a recent work by @xcite points out how much these questions about radial motions of ionized gas in agns are still open .",
    "on the basis of velocity  resolved reverberation mapping , these authors suggested that blueshifting in blr could be due to rayleigh scattering associated to inflowing gas towards the super - massive bh ( smbh ) .",
    "we addressed these open questions by selecting a sample of nls1s and we focused our work on the following topics : 1 ) the analysis of the shape of the blr h@xmath0 emission line to quantify how much a lorentzian profile is typical in these agns and to investigate if the width of h@xmath0 is connected to other physical parameters of the active nucleus like the eddington ratio ; 2 ) the analysis of the blr emission lines from feii , oi and caii to clarify if a strong feii emission is a distinctive property of nls1s and to explore the physical properties of the low ionization gas ; 3 ) the analysis of the radial motions of ionized gas observed in the narrow - line region ( nlr ) to understand which are the main drivers and whether the blue wings are related to the shift of the core component . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we describe the selection of the sample of nls1candidate galaxies with its main properties , and the details of the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the results of the analysis are shown in section 4 and discussed in section 5 . in section 6 , we summarize the results of this work .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath11 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 to compare our results with the most recent papers .",
    "we extracted our nls1s sample from the archive of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss  dr7 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we selected emission - line objects , classified as `` galaxies '' or `` qso '' by sdss , with redshift between 0.02 and 0.35 in order to have a spectral range including [ oii]@xmath13727 and [ sii]@xmath146717,6731 .",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath0 was forced in the range 8003000 km s@xmath3 , the lower limit was decided on the basis of the measurements of seyfert 2 and intermediate - type seyfert galaxies by @xcite , and the upper limit was arbitrarily fixed larger than 2000 km s@xmath3 to avoid possible losses caused by inaccurate measurements . finally , we chose objects showing h@xmath0 and oxygen lines , which are prominent features in the optical spectra of agns , and with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of [ oi]@xmath16300 larger than 3 .",
    "this last criterion was used because [ oi ] is weak , therefore its detection ensures the presence of the other brighter emission lines with a good s / n .",
    "furthermore , this emission line is stronger in agns than in hii regions because of the shape of the ionizing spectrum . in section [ nlr_fitting ]",
    "we discussed whether or not this criterion could introduce a bias .",
    "the query result is a sample of 2372 objects contaminated by liners , seyfert 2 and intermediate - type seyfert galaxies .",
    "we checked each spectrum by visual inspection , doing three iterations . at first",
    ", we set a flag to mark liners and seyfert 2 galaxies , and another flag for intermediate - type seyfert and nls1candidates .",
    "then , we performed a second iteration by checking again each object of these sub - samples to be sure that our classification was correct . after a third final check",
    ", we got a list of 360 nls1candidates out of 2372 sources .",

    "[ z_hist ] , middle panel ) with median value of 19 and interquartile range ( iqr ) of 9 .",
    "finally , the logarithm of the luminosity of the continuum at rest - frame 5100   ( @xmath1l@xmath15 ) , in unit of erg s@xmath3 , shows a range of values of 43.245.3 ( fig .",

    "[ sn_spettri ] shows some examples of spectra with different values of s / n = 10 , 15 , 25 , 35 and 45 , from top to bottom .",
    "the spectra were corrected for galactic reddening using the iraf task deredden and the values of @xmath16band extinction found in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , then they were shifted to rest  frame with the iraf task newredshift and their dispersion was modified to a value of 1   px@xmath3 with the iraf task dispcor . after these preliminary procedures , we fitted narrow emission lines by means of pan ( peak analysis ) , a public idl software with a graphical interface based on mpfit @xcite . after subtracting the underlying continuum of each line , we found that a single gaussian function was suitable for fitting the [ oii ] , [ fevii ] , [ oi ] and [ sii ] doublets emission lines .",
    "we did not use two gaussians for the [ oii ] doublet because , although their separation of 3   is at the resolution limit of our data , the two lines are not resolved and their summed profiles give rise to a single smoothed spectral line . to properly model the h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] emission lines the feii multiplets lines had to be subtracted .",
    "this was accomplished by using the software developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after the feii subtraction , we fitted the [ oiii ] doublet by using first a single gaussian function for each line and then by adding more components in order to fit asymmetric profiles .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile was fitted by means of a single gaussian function for the narrow component ( h@xmath17 ) with fwhm , central wavelength and [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio fixed only when necessary , and a single lorentzian function or 2 gaussian functions for the broad component ( h@xmath18 ) . for consistency ,",
    "oi @xmath19 and cat were fitted with the same function used for the corresponding h@xmath0 broad profile .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider a correlation strong when either the pearson or the spearman rank coefficients ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are larger than 0.7 and weak when they are between 0.3 and 0.5 .",
    "we consider a correlation significant when the probability that the correlation is not present , the p - value , is lower than 0.001 .",
    "we report the significance only for correlation coefficients lower than 0.7 .",
    "the same threshold of 0.001 was used for the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k  s ) test . to describe the statistical distributions",
    ", we use the median as typical value , and , as dispersion , the standard deviation in case of normal distributions and the interquartile range ( that is , the difference between the upper and lower quartiles ) in generic distributions .      the flux uncertainties were estimated assuming that the determination of the continuum level is the main source of error . accordingly , we calculated the relative errors as the ratio between the intensity of the peak of each emission line over the continuum and the standard deviation of the continuum measured in a spectral region near the emission line .",
    "the median values are around 1020 per cent for stronger lines , such as [ sii ] and [ oiii ] , up to 6065 per cent for the weak [ oi ] .",
    "the uncertainties of fwhm , density , velocity shift and continuum slope were estimated with the following method . for each quantity we reconstructed one or more model spectra obtained from our fitting and we added them to 100 randomly - selected spectra with different s / n , whose lines and continuum were previously subtracted .",
    "the same fitting procedure was applied and the distributions of the measurements were analysed .",
    "almost normal distributions centred in the expected values were found .    for the fwhm of [ sii ] and of [ oiii ] core and wing components we found standard deviations of the distributions corresponding to errors of 5 up to 10 per cent .",
    "for the density we obtained a percentage error of about 25 per cent .",
    "the measurements of the [ oiii ] velocity shift have a normal distribution with @xmath22 kms@xmath3 .    for the continuum slope , errors range between 10 and 50 per cent .",
    "the fitting of the slope can be affected by the host galaxy contribution and by the internal extinction .",
    "the estimate of the contribution of the former is controversial because of the lack of the absorption features .",
    "many of them are suppressed by the non - thermal continuum or confused in the noise of the spectra .",
    "we measured the equivalent width ( ew ) of cak@xmath23 in 157 out of our 360 spectra , and in 113 the values are smaller than 1.5  .",
    "only 44 objects show strong absorption features .",
    "we tested the effects of the galaxy spectrum using a stellar template with solar metallicity and age of 11 gyr , following @xcite , and three agn spectra whose continuum was fitted with power - law indices @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the stellar template was normalized and multiplied by scaling factors from 0.1 to 0.9 and the resulting spectra were subtracted from the three normalized agn spectra . in this way we obtained spectra with a different contribution of the host galaxy with respect to the agn continuum .",
    "we measured the slope and analysed the values of @xmath28 as a function of the ew of cak .",
    "the average change of @xmath28 values for low - ew objects is about 50 per cent , while it can be 2.5 times larger for high - ew objects .",
    "the extinction effects were estimated by using the typical a@xmath29 values found in @xcite .",
    "we calculated a median extinction a@xmath30 with a standard deviation of 0.31 . by assuming a@xmath31 and the extinction law by @xcite , the slope becomes steeper of about @xmath25 , regardless of the input value of @xmath28 .",
    "for the fwhm of the feii multiplets the errors are about 512 per cent , for values between @xmath32 and @xmath33 kms@xmath3 .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that the multiplets are made by numerous transitions which are close in wavelengths , therefore the more the velocity dispersion increases , the more the global profile becomes smoothed and difficult to be precisely fitted .",
    "this effect can be even stronger when the ew of feii is small .",
    "an additional source of error could be the presence of the feii narrow emissions , which is not considered by the software . to evaluate their contribution it is definitely not an easy task .",
    "we made some tests using the list of transitions and relative intensities for the broad and narrow component of feii published by ( see their tables a.1 and a.2 ) .",
    "we reconstructed four templates for the broad component , using lorentzian functions having fwhm = 1000 , 1300 , 2000 , 2700 km s@xmath3 , and two templates for the narrow component , using gaussian functions having fwhm = 300 and 600 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these input values have been chosen on the basis of our measurements of h@xmath18 and nlr emission lines .",
    "each broad template was summed to 100 narrow templates having fixed fwhm and different intensities .",
    "to apply realistic scale factors , we used the data of 4178 objects from ( * ? ? ? * their table 1 ) .",
    "first , we calculated the intensity ratios between their narrow and broad feii fluxes , then we generated 100 random numbers within the interval of observed values ( 0.0050.5 ) , making sure that they had a distribution similar to the real one .",
    "finally , we combined the 100 broad plus narrow templates with 100 feii - subtracted spectra and we applied the fitting software .",
    "the spectra obtained from the broad template alone were also fitted as a comparison .",
    "we calculated the ratios between the fwhms obtained for spectra with only the broad component and those with broad plus narrow components . for each value of the broad component ,",
    "the ratios do not depend on the value of the narrow component , whose width , indeed , does not affect the result of the fitting . by comparing different values of broad fwhm , we found that when the fwhm is approximately lower than @xmath34kms@xmath3 , the ratio is @xmath35 with a @xmath36 of about 34 per cent , while for larger fwhms ( 20002700kms@xmath3 ) the ratio increases systematically toward 1.11.2 with a @xmath36 of about 916 per cent . in conclusion , for small values of fwhm the possible presence of a narrow component does not affect our measurements of the fwhm of feii multiplets . for larger values of fwhm",
    ", the multiples appear blurred , making the narrow component more visible and giving , as a result , smaller values of fwhm .        in order to better analyse the h@xmath0 line ,",
    "both the [ oiii ] and feii contributions must be subtracted .",
    "the analysis of the h@xmath28 line was omitted because our spectra do not have both s / n and resolution high enough to fit its profile without introducing many constraints that would imply significant uncertainties .",
    "we decided to model the h@xmath0 broad component ( h@xmath18 ) with a lorentzian function following @xcite and .",
    "this approach was successful for 335 sources , only 25 spectra showed strong asymmetries with red and/or blue wings , which could not be reproduced by a lorentzian function . in these cases",
    "two gaussians were used to fit the broad component .",
    "the contribution of the narrow component of h@xmath0 ( h@xmath17 ) was taken into account by using a constrained gaussian function , whose fwhm was fixed according to the values measured for [ oii]@xmath13727 , [ oi]@xmath16300 and [ sii]@xmath146717,6731 .",
    "the central wavelength was let free to vary in 30 per cent of the spectra . in the remaining cases , we had to fix it according to the values of [ oii ] in order to improve the fitting .",
    "we applied an additional constraint , forcing the ratio [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath17 to vary in the range 220 , a reasonable interval of values for the nlr of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio between the narrow and the broad component of h@xmath0 emission line has a distribution ranging from 0.01 to 0.34 , with a median value of 0.05 and an iqr of 0.04 .",
    "323 out of 360 objects have h@xmath17/h@xmath18 lower than 0.1 , therefore in most cases h@xmath17 contributes typically with less than 10 per cent to the total flux of h@xmath0 .    for h@xmath18 fitted by two gaussians , we obtained the fwhm after the correction for instrumental resolution . in case of a lorentzian fitting",
    ", it was not possible to obtain the intrinsic fwhm by deconvolving the instrumental width from the measured one . therefore , we decided to convolve lorentzian functions having fwhm from 5 to 40   with a gaussian function with fwhm = 2.7   ( the instrumental resolution at @xmath37  ) .",
    "we measured the width of these profiles and we calculated the relation to convert from the observed fwhm to the intrinsic one ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we applied this relation to correct for the instrumental resolution and we converted the values into velocities .",
    "the sample of nls1s was defined using the criterion of fwhm(h@xmath18 ) @xmath39 km s@xmath40 per cent",
    ". the tolerance was chosen on the basis of the instrumental width ( 167 km s@xmath3 ) . in support of this choice",
    ", we checked how the fwhm measurement changes with decreasing s / n .",
    "we created a lorentzian profile with fwhm=2000 km s@xmath3 and we added noise , in order to obtain spectra having h@xmath18 with s / n from 5 to 45 with step of 5 .",
    "these spectra have been fitted with the same method used for our data and the measured values of fwhm are 2300 km s@xmath3 for s / n = 5 , 2100 km s@xmath3 for s / n = 10 , up to 2000 km s@xmath3 for s / n = 45 .",
    "the s / n of h@xmath18 for the sample of spectra fitted with a lorentzian function ranges between 6 and 87 and its distribution has a median value of approximately 24 with iqr of 16 .",
    "therefore , we can be confident that our upper limit of 2200 km s@xmath3 is acceptable and that the measured values of fwhm do not strongly depend on the fitting and on the quality of the spectra .    by applying our criterion , we selected 296 nls1s out of 360 candidates .",
    "we classified the remaining 64 objects as bls1s , but we did not consider them as a real control sample .",
    "we stress that this sample is not representative of the whole class of bls1s , having fwhm values too close to those of nls1s ( fwhm(h@xmath18)@xmath722003700kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "the black hole masses was estimated by assuming that the blr clouds are virialized @xcite and by means of the usual formula : @xmath41 the radius of the blr ( @xmath42 ) was obtained through the h@xmath18 luminosity ( @xmath43))@xcite : @xmath44 where a@xmath45 , b@xmath46 .",

    ", it would be necessary to remove the turbulent one .",
    "since this procedure is not trivial and we needed to compare our results with those of other authors , we preferred not to apply any model - dependent correction to our fwhm measurements .",
    "it is not simple to estimate the uncertainties of the measurements of the black hole mass which is calculated as a function of the gas velocity dispersion and of the blr radius .",
    "we can assume an uncertainty of 10 per cent for the fwhm , depending on the fitting procedure and the s / n .",
    "the radius was obtained from a relation depending on the @xmath49 , which is affected by the flux calibration errors and by the intrinsic variability of the sources . on the basis of the light curves of 17 agns published by @xcite , we inferred a median l(h@xmath18 ) variation of 20 per cent and we assumed this value as a typical error due to the use of a single epoch measurement .",

    "the model for the high s / n spectrum is very good and also in the other case the overall trend is reproduced quite well .",
    "the error in flux determination due to the s / n of spectra was about 10 per cent for s / n=10 and 20 per cent for s / n=5 .",

    "it must be noticed that recently @xcite claimed to have measured for the first time the narrow component of oi@xmath18446 in 8 out of 23 type 1 agns observed in nir .",
    "the typical intensity ratio of narrow to broad oi@xmath18446 was 0.1 and in a couple of cases even 0.2 and 0.5 .",

    "firstly , we carefully subtracted the continuum underlying each line by considering a small spectral range centred on the line .",

    "the fwhm of the [ sii ] lines was forced to be the same , while the centre of [ sii]@xmath16731 was obtained as a function of the centre of [ sii]@xmath16717 . finally , we measured the [ oiii ] doublet using , as first guess , a single gaussian function for each line with the following constraints : the same fwhm , the centre of [ oiii]@xmath14959 to be obtained as a function of the centre of [ oiii]@xmath55 , the flux ratio [ oiii]@xmath14959/@xmath15007 fixed to 1/3 .",
    "then , we checked the residuals and we applied a multi - gaussian fitting with the same constraints , where necessary .",
    "we obtained a good result with a single gaussian function in only 34 out of 360 objects , while 317 objects required two gaussian functions , one narrower ( called _ core component _ ) and the other broader ( called _ wing component _ ) . in seven cases ,",
    "three components were used and in a single extreme case , sdss j122604.17 + 250637.6 , four components were applied to fit a really complicated profile .",

    "the median errors , calculated as explained in section  [ errors ] , are around 1020 per cent for stronger lines , such as [ sii ] , [ oii ] and [ oiii ] , up to 6065 per cent for the weak [ oi ] .    as mentioned in section  [ sample ]",
    ", we need to verify whether or not the criterion of [ oi]@xmath16300 s / n @xmath56 used for the sample selection could have caused a contamination of objects ionized by shock waves .",

    "they can have a role also in the nlr of agns affecting emission line fluxes and their profiles ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however the actual contribution to the formation of the spectrum when compared to photoionization is still a matter of debate . in a photoionization context ,",
    "[ oi]@xmath16300 is produced in the partially - ionized recombination region of an ionized gas cloud , and its strength is sensitive to the shape of the ionizing spectrum and to the cloud geometrical thickness . in particular , the larger number of high - energy photons emitted by the power - law continuum of an agn , with respect to a blackbody stellar continuum , expands this partially - ionized region making the [ oi]@xmath16300 stronger by a factor of 10 in agns than in hii or star - forming regions .",
    "the predicted ratios [ oi]@xmath16300/h@xmath0 for a power - law spectrum with @xmath57 and assuming a gas with @xmath58@xmath59 are between 0.1 and 1.0 , depending on the value of the ionization parameter @xmath60 @xcite . in our sample , [ oi]@xmath16300/h@xmath0 ratios",

    "lorentzian profiles give , as a result , narrow emission line ratios in good agreement with those observed in the nlr of seyfert 2 galaxies as found by who suggested also that the broad balmer lines could be emitted by a large disk .",

    ", @xcite found that lorentzian profiles yield less satisfying results than employing two gaussian components having different fwhms .",
    "@xcite used two broad gaussians to fit the h@xmath0 profile , while @xcite and @xcite applied a multi - gaussian fitting .",
    "the double gaussian can be justifed by assuming that the blr is made of two kinematically different regions placed at different distances from the central source : an intermediate - line region and a very broad - line region ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a multi - gaussian approach could suggest that the blr is made of a continuum of different regions .",
    "our analysis of the h@xmath0 broad emission line in a sample of 296 nls1s and 64 bls1s suggests that the lorentzian profiles are predominant in nls1s .",
    "more in general , a lorentzian profile seems to be more suited for objects having @xmath188 km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "our bls1s appear to be transition objects between nls1s and the bls1s family sharing common properties with nls1s , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite who declared that nls1s show a clear continuity with bls1s and that they do not really represent a disjoint class of agns .",
    "furthermore , our upper limit to define a nls1 ( fwhm(h@xmath18 ) @xmath53 2200 km s@xmath3 ) depends on the spectral resolution of our data rather than on a different distribution of fwhm for the two samples .",
    "therefore , it seems that the main difference between the bls1 and the nls1 families is not the widths of the broad line profiles , but their shapes .",
    "indeed , in our sample there is a continuity in the distribution of profiles going from the lorentzian symmetric shapes of almost all nls1s ( with the exception of 5 cases ) to the double - gaussian and often asymmetric profiles of about a third of our bls1s .",
    "this effect can be explained if we assume that the blr motion is due to a turbulent component kinematically represented by a lorentzian profile combined with a rotational component represented by a gaussian profile .",
    "nls1s would be slow - rotating agns , in which narrower lorentzian profiles are the effect of the dominant role of the turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , can be due to the presence of less massive bhs in nls1s than in bls1s , even if an inclination effect of a flat distribution of blr clouds can not be completely ruled out @xcite and it could explain the spread in the fwhm distribution , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "this is in agreement with the results of and , who measured the bh masses with the second - order momentum of the line , which is independent of the inclination .",
    "therefore , we do not believe that , in general , nls1s show narrower permitted lines because of an inclination effect of a disk - like blr .",
    "lower bh masses imply higher normalized accretion rates in nls1s with respect to bls1s , as confirmed also by our data .",
    "indeed , the objects fitted by a lorentzian function show also higher values of eddington ratio than the objects fitted by a double - gaussian profile .",
    "since they are mostly nls1s , this result reinforces the idea that nls1s are characterized by both lorentzian shape profiles and high eddington ratios .",

    "these decreasing percentages , going from type 1 to type 2 agns , are in agreement with the unified model and suggest that the gas kinematics of the nlr is more turbulent in its inner part . from our analysis",
    "we can infer that this asymmetry is very likely caused by the presence of outflowing gas from the inner regions of the active nucleus , which interacts with the surrounding medium both by transferring kinetic energy and making it more turbulent and by reducing the ew of [ oiii ] as its velocity increases .",
    "indeed , in their analysis of the properties of [ oiii ] emission line profiles , @xcite found that the shift of the wing component correlates with the ew of the [ oiii ] whole emission ( @xmath211 , p - value @xmath212 ) .",
    "@xcite confirmed that agns with blue wings in [ oiii ] are characterized by lower values of ew and claimed that the radial motion of the clouds can decrease the covering factor of the nlr , resulting in a lower ew .",
    "the high eddington ratio in nls1s is in principle expected to affect also the nlr , as the resulting radiation pressure accelerates the nlr gas @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the presence and the strength of a blue wing are not correlated with the eddington ratio @xcite , even if high values of @xmath108 ( @xmath213 ) could be associated with more prominent blue wings @xcite .",

    "nonetheless , we did not observe fast outflows in objects showing low luminosities and low accretion rates . indeed , according to @xcite , while the agn determines the starting values of the outflow velocity , its final speed is more related to the density of the ism : high density ism implies more [ oiii ] emission and decelerates the outflow more efficiently .",
    "unexpectedly , no correlation was found between the velocity of the outflow and the electron density of the medium , in disagreement with @xcite , but in fact we measured the average density of the low - ionization gas , which is not representative of the whole medium and does not take into account possible small size and overdense regions @xcite . in conclusion , in our case , it is not clear whether a physical connection related to the ism properties and in particular to its density really exists between the [ oiii ] emission and the presence of a wing . on the other hand , high radio luminosities or accretion rates seem to be a necessary , but not sufficient condition , because the velocity of the outflowing gas and the strength of its emission must depend on the environment through which it moves .",
    "the radial motion of the gas seems to be responsible also for the observed blueshift of the core component of [ oiii ] .",
    "our analysis shows that the faster is the outflow the higher is the blueshift . in this picture",
    "the so - called blue outliers are only the objects at the extreme tail of the blueshift distribution , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "the continuous distribution in fig .  [ v1_vs2_vs_v2 ] justifies the small number of observed blue outliers , since high blueshifts can be detected only in objects with very fast outflows ( @xmath214 } < -400 $ ] km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "of course , this is a first result which must be definitely proved with spectra having higher s / n and higher spectral resolution than sdss spectra .",

    "this is more evident in blue outliers , whose fwhms are found to increase with increasing blueshift .",
    "this trend was observed not only for [ oiii ] lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "high - ionization nlr lines show more frequently large shifts , as found for [ oiii ] and [ fevii ] in this work , for [ neiii ] and [ nev ] by @xcite and for lines up to [ fex ] by @xcite .",
    "thus , the frequency and the strength of the shift increase with increasing ionization potential , confirming the scenario of an outflow moving through a stratified ism ionized by the nuclear source .",
    "moreover , the high - ionization blr civ@xmath215 line is found to be blueshifted by about 600 kms@xmath3 @xcite and to correlate with [ oiii ] blueshift @xcite .",
    "these correlations and other similarities between [ oiii ] and civ shift suggest that there could be a kinematic connection between blr and nlr @xcite .",
    "@xcite affirmed that an explanation for the observed blueshift could be the rayleigh scattering associated to gas inflowing towards the smbh .",
    "the kinematic connection between blr and nlr gas could imply that also nlr blueshifts are due to inflow and scattering .",
    "if the radial motion of the clouds is expected to decrease the ionized gas covering factor and to reduce its emissivity , we should observe for the core component of [ oiii ] a similar relation found between the velocity shift of the wing and the ew of the line .",
    "but this was not the case , since we did not find any correlation showing that larger blueshifts are preferentially detected in objects having weaker [ oiii ] lines , in disagreement with @xcite .",
    "we only observed a slight decrease of the fraction of objects with blueshifts larger than @xmath10 kms@xmath3 as the ew increases .",
    "the radial motion could be caused by the accretion disk wind and therefore we should expect to find a correlation with the eddington ratio , as found by @xcite .",

    "the blueshift seems to weakly depend on the eddington ratio , but high blueshifts are not detected at low values of this parameter .",
    "interestingly , even the blue outliers appear not to depend on the eddington ratio , but rather on the bh mass and the luminosity of the active nucleus .",
    "however , the eddington ratio is calculated by means of these two quantities , therefore , if the correlations of both continuum luminosity and bh mass with the velocity shift of [ oiii ] are similar , the dependency on the eddington ratio could disappear .    our blue outliers show eddington ratios distributed within the range of values of the whole sample and they are not those agns with the highest values of this quantity ( see top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ hist_eddington ] ) . however , the frequency of blue outliers increases with increasing eddington ratio ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ hist_eddington ] ) . indeed , if it is true that blue outliers are often characterized by high @xmath108 ratios @xcite , not all high eddington ratio agns with narrow h@xmath18 are blue outliers @xcite .",
    "finally , the blueshift of [ oiii ] core component does not seem to be affected by the radio emission , as already found for the wing component .",
    "we believe that a powerful radio emission is mandatory to significantly affect the nlr kinematics .",
    "since only 11 nls1s in our sample are radio - loud , the lack of a correlation with radio properties is expected .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a correlation between the [ neiii ] linewidth and the radio luminosity for high luminosity objects and claimed that the interaction of the radio jet with the ism could explain the observed kinematics .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that blue outliers are more frequent in radio - loud sources likely because of an interaction between the nlr and the relativistic jets .",
    "in this work we analysed the spectra of 360 nls1candidates , selected from a sample of 2372 objects extracted from the sdss archive .",
    "296 out of 360 turned out to be real nls1s .",
    "we classified the remaining 64 as bls1s and we used them to show that nls1s and bls1s are agns with contiguous properties . in the following the main results of this paper are summarized :    * the broad h@xmath0 line was successfully fitted with a lorentzian function in 291 out of 296 nls1s and 44 out of 64 bls1s .",
    "this kind of profile is typical in nls1s and more in general in type 1 agns having fwhm(h@xmath0 ) @xmath53 4000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this seems to be a more substantial difference between nls1s and classic bls1s rather than the different width of their broad lines . *",
    "the eddington ratio can be used in place of fwhm(h@xmath0 ) as a criterion to define nls1s .",
    "therefore an agn having broad lines with a lorentzian profile and a high eddington ratio is very likely a nls1 .",
    "* r4570 in nls1s covers a wide range of ratios , which depends on the eddington ratio , in agreement with the eigenvector 1 .",
    "nls1s are commonly known to have strong feii and indeed the highest values of r4570 are observed in agns with fwhm(h@xmath0 ) @xmath53 4000 km s@xmath3 , but in fact they can equally have weak feii emission .",
    "those nls1s showing high r4570 ratios are simultaneously characterized by strong feii and weak h@xmath0 . *",
    "the feii , calcium and hydrogen emission regions seem to share the same location in the blr , showing a similar kinematics .",
    "the high density ( @xmath216 @xmath59 ) required by caii triplet emission is in agreement with the collisional excitation mechanism invoked to explain the strong feii emission frequently observed in nls1s .",
    "* feii is often associated to oi , which seems to be emitted by a region located farther away from the smbh and likely having different physical properties .",
    "oi does not always require high density as caii triplet does , and it is mainly caused by ly@xmath0 fluorescence with an additional , but rare , contribution of collisional excitation .",
    "* 94 per cent of our entire sample shows [ oiii ] lines with an asymmetric profile .",
    "no difference appears to exist between nls1s and bls1s with respect to this property .",
    "the asymmetry is produced by gas outflowing from the inner regions of the agn .",
    "this gas is turbulent and affects the surrounding medium making it turbulent , as well .",
    "in addition , the outflow is likely responsible for the observed blueshift of the core component of [ oiii ] line .",
    "the velocity of the outflow does not seem to depend on the agn power or on the radio emission and only very weakly on the accretion rate .",
    "nonetheless , fast outflows are not observed in low - luminosity and low - accretion rate objects . *",
    "blue outliers are rare likely because very fast outflowing gas is mandatory to make the [ oiii ] core component strongly blueshifted .",
    "the amount of the shift in blue outliers seems to be correlated both with the mass of the smbh and with the continuum luminosity , but not with the eddington ratio .",
    "however , blue outliers are high - eddington - ratios agns , therefore having high eddington ratios is likely a necessary but not a sufficient condition .",
