    "an important feature of quantum mechanics is that it imposes fundamental limits on how accurately physical quantities can be measured . on the other hand , by taking advantage of the features of quantum mechanics , one can perform measurements that are far more accurate than would otherwise be possible .",
    "many types of precision measurement use a form of interferometry .",
    "one particular example is optical interferometry , which is used to measure distance via changes in phase . in this case , if one uses @xmath0 independent photons , then the accuracy of the phase measurement scales as @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one takes advantage of quantum mechanics by using @xmath0 photons in a special entangled state , then the accuracy can scale as @xmath2 , yielding vastly higher accuracy for large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a commonly considered entangled state is the noon state , where @xmath0 photons are in a superposition of being all in one arm of the interferometer or the other @xcite .",
    "these states have the advantage that they provide accuracy scaling as @xmath2 , with the drawback that the phase needs to be initially known to this accuracy ; otherwise the measurement is ambiguous .",
    "one way of interpreting the accuracy is that @xmath3 measurements with @xmath3 copies of this state will yield accuracy @xmath4 .",
    "an alternative approach is to combine measurements using noon states with many different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the measurements with smaller values of @xmath0 are used to resolve the ambiguity in the measurements with larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite . instead of considering noon states",
    ", one can instead consider multiple passes through a phase shift  @xcite .",
    "another area of interferometry is that using transitions in atomic or solid - state systems .",
    "this can be used for time standards or frequency measurement , or probing physical quantities that affect the frequency .",
    "the particular application we consider here is the use of a single nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centre  in diamond to probe the magnetic field at the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "experiments in such systems have demonstrated sensitivity of @xmath5 nt with a spatial resolution of @xmath6 nm . the nv  centre  has excellent properties for magnetic sensing , because it can be individually addressed and maintains spin coherence for a significant period of time at room temperature .",
    "a fundamental difficulty with these measurement techniques is that the measurement signal has periodic modulation .",
    "the measurement time is either restricted to half an oscillation period , or the magnetic field range must be known accurately in advance .",
    "this is essentially the same problem as occurs when performing phase measurements with noon states , and it is therefore natural to apply the same measurement schemes as were developed for noon states .",
    "this is what was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was experimentally demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . for this system",
    "the interpretation is that the measurements provide a high dynamic range , rather than a quantum improvement as in the case of noon states .    in optical interferometry",
    ", it has been found that adaptive measurements are typically the most accurate @xcite .",
    "that is , information from early parts of the measurement are used to adjust how the measurement is performed .",
    "in fact , for measurements on a single mode , nonadaptive measurements are unable to achieve better than @xmath1 scaling even for highly nonclassical states @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for measurements on multiple time modes , such as measurements on multiple noon states , nonadaptive measurements can yield the same accuracy scaling as adaptive measurements @xcite .",
    "an important difference between optical measurements and measurements with nv  centres is that the nv  centre  measurements have lower visibility .",
    "there is both a reduced initial visibility , and the visibility decreases exponentially with interaction time due to decoherence . in the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite the initial visibility is only about 80% , whereas visibilities in optical interferometry are often 98% or better @xcite .",
    "it turns out that when the visibility is this low , the adaptive measurement schemes that have been developed in previous work become very inaccurate @xcite .",
    "this is why nonadaptive measurements were used in refs .",
    "even the nonadaptive measurements have somewhat poor performance for low visibility .",
    "it should be possible for some adaptive method to provide improved performance , because adaptive measurements are more general than nonadaptive measurements .",
    "the adaptive techniques that were considered for nv  centre  magnetometry before were those based on the technique from refs .",
    "this technique only optimises the measurement locally , in the sense that it minimises the variance after the next detection .",
    "an alternative technique is to use global optimisation to minimise the final variance at the end of the measurement .",
    "such an optimisation is far more challenging , but particle swarm optimisation techniques have been found to be effective for single - time - mode measurements @xcite . an alternative technique for measurements with multiple noon states of different sizes was proposed by cappellaro @xcite . here",
    "we combine particle swarm optimisation techniques with the method of cappellaro to find adaptive measurements that provide improved performance for nv  centre   magnetometry .",
    "in this section we summarise ramsey interferometry , and how it is used with nv  centres .",
    "the probe state is prepared in the superposition state @xmath7 . given that the energy level splitting is @xmath8 , the state evolves over time @xmath9 to @xmath10 . in the case we are interested in",
    ", the energy level splitting is due to the different spin states , and is proportional to the magnetic field .",

    "@xcite initialised the system in the @xmath21 state , then used a @xmath25 pulse to obtain a superposition of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . after allowing the system to accumulate a phase depending on the magnetic field ,",
    "another @xmath25 pulse was used , then the system was measured in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 basis .",
    "the advanced phase estimation algorithms developed in optics depend on using a controllable phase , that is either controlled in a predetermined way ( in the nonadaptive case ) , or based on the results of measurements ( in the adaptive case ) . in optics this controlled phase can be implemented by putting a phase modulator in one arm of an interferometer . in the ramsey interferometry experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite this controlled phase was implemented by changing the phase of the second @xmath25 pulse . by changing the phase of the pulse",

    ", the probability distribution for the measurement results is @xcite @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a factor representing the visibility of the measurement , and @xmath42 is the transverse spin coherence time .",
    "the time @xmath42 indicates the decay rate of spin coherence in the system , and sets an effective limit on the maximum duration of measurements on the system .",
    "if one were to just use all measurements with the same interaction time , @xmath30 , then for a _ total _ interaction time @xmath43 the phase variance would be no less than @xmath2 , where @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to an uncertainty in @xmath36 lower bounded as @xmath45 we can reduce the variance by increasing @xmath30 , but that also reduces the range of the measurement .",
    "the dynamic range ( the ratio of the uncertainty to the maximum magnetic field that can be detected ) is lower bounded as @xmath46    in contrast , when we use multiple interaction times , the phase variance is lower bounded as approximately @xmath47 ( the exact lower bound is in eq .  ) .",
    "the corresponding lower bound to the dynamic range is then @xmath48 that is , we potentially obtain a square improvement in the dynamic range by using measurement techniques with multiple interaction times .",
    "this is analogous to the improvement from the standard quantum limit to the heisenberg limit with noon states .",
    "in order to determine estimates of the phase ( and thereby the magnetic field ) , it is convenient to use bayesian estimation to calculate the probability distribution for the system phase based on successive measurement results @xcite .",
    "this enables one to calculate the exact phase variance for a given measurement scheme @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field is initially unknown , other than being confined to the range @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "this means that there is no initial knowledge of the phase , so the prior distribution is @xmath49 here the notation that is used is that the successive measurement results are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and so forth , and a vector of @xmath52 measurement results is @xmath53 .",
    "the initial vector of zero length before any measurement results are taken is @xmath54 .",
    "each interferometric measurement provides additional information about the phase @xmath33 , and therefore the magnetic field .",
    "this information is quantified by using bayes rule to update the probability distribution as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the outcome of the most recent measurement .",
    "note that the denominator of the bayesian function has not been explicitly given here as it is independent of the measurement outcome , and serves only as a normalising factor for the probability distribution .",
    "the formula to use for @xmath57 is given in eq .  .",
    "as the bayesian probability distribution is a product of sinusoids , it is convenient to use the fourier series of the probability distribution function to represent it . we write the general form of the probability distribution as @xmath58 note that , in practice , the sum need not be taken to infinity , because the probability distribution is a product of a limited number of sinusoids .    combining the representation above with eq .  , it is possible to derive the simple update rule for the coefficients of the fourier series @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "note that this formula is only applicable when the system is restricted to integer multiples of the interaction time , which will be the case for the metrology methods considered within this paper .",
    "numeric simulations of the phase estimation process may be performed by tracking the coefficients of the probability distribution and updating them for each measurement using the formula given above .    to estimate the accuracy of the phase measurement , it is convenient to use the holevo variance @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the estimate of the phase . to account for biased estimates of the phase one can use @xmath63 in place of @xmath64 .",
    "the holevo variance is close to the usual variance for narrowly peaked distributions . for phase",
    "an advantage of the holevo variance is that it is naturally modulo @xmath65 .",
    "that is , a phase close to @xmath66 is regarded as also close to @xmath67 . in the case where the phase is used for measuring the magnetic field , this is a little problematic , because an estimate near @xmath68 would be regarded as accurate if the actual magnetic field is near @xmath69 .    to avoid the problem of having a large error in the estimate of the field near @xmath70",
    ", one can consider an initial probability distribution for the magnetic field that is in the range @xmath71 $ ] , where @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 is a constant chosen such that the probability of the error ( in the magnetic field estimate ) being larger than @xmath74 is negligible .",
    "then the actual dynamic range would be @xmath75 , but for large dynamic range this will be close to @xmath76 .",
    "we do not consider that correction in this work , because we consider large dynamic range where it is negligible .",
    "another feature of the holevo variance is that it means only one coefficient of the fourier series for the probability distribution is important .",
    "first , the optimal phase estimate to use is @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "second , the holevo variance can be determined exactly by summing the value of @xmath78 over all combinations of measurement results .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for explanation of how this is done .",
    "it is therefore unnecessary to track all nonzero coefficients , and we can restrict ourselves to recording those that contribute to the final value of @xmath79 .",
    "this considerably simplifies the calculation .",
    "the calculation can be further simplified by noting that the probability distribution is real , so @xmath80 , and only half the coefficients need be stored .",
    "the lower bound to the holevo variance is @xcite @xmath81.\\ ] ] this bound is slightly less than @xmath47 , but it approaches @xmath47 in the limit of large @xmath0 . the lower bound @xmath2 given in sec .",
    "[ sec : ram ] for measurements with all the same interaction time was also in terms of @xmath82 . in that case",
    "it is not a tight lower bound , and there does not appear to be a known analytic expression for the tight bound .",
    "there are several different aspects of the phase estimation procedure that can be controlled with the aim of achieving the best possible estimate .",
    "one can obtain improved performance with entangled states ; for example , the equivalent of optical noon states would be @xmath0 entangled nv  centres .",
    "entangled nv  centres have been demonstrated @xcite , but are not yet at the stage where they can effectively be used for magnetometry .",
    "for this reason we consider the improvement of the choice of interaction time and control phase @xmath83 .    the procedure to perform the phase is to begin with the longest viable interaction time , and then systematically reduce it by a factor of @xmath84 , performing multiple repetitions for each interaction time .",
    "in the following we use the terminology `` detection '' for the individual measurements , to distinguish them from the overall measurement based on the combination of these individual detections . the initial interaction time is @xmath85 , and the sequence of multipliers is @xmath86 .",
    "the number of detections used for the longest interaction time is denoted @xmath87 , and each time the interaction time is halved the number of detections is increased by @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , for interaction time @xmath89 , the number of detections is @xmath90 the total interaction time used is then @xcite @xmath91.\\ ] ] this sequence is similar to that in refs .",
    "@xcite , and to the optical technique in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although it was found to be possible to take @xmath92 for adaptive measurements  @xcite , for nonadaptive measurements it is necessary to take @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite found that the nonadaptive measurements gave better results than the adaptive technique of ref .",
    "@xcite for poor visibility .",
    "nevertheless , if the initial visibility was too low , the nonadaptive measurements were still quite poor .",
    "the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite addressed this by increasing the number of detections for each interaction time .",
    "reference  @xcite used @xmath94 and @xmath95 , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite used @xmath96 .",
    "the key difference in our approach is how we adjust the control phase @xmath83 based on the measurement results . in general , the strategy for choosing the control phase based on measurement results can be described by a binary decision tree , as in fig .  [ ptree ] .",
    "the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite was to choose the size of the step dependent on the detection result and the number of previous detections .",
    "an alternative approach is to update the controlled phase based on the estimate of the system phase .",
    "this approach is essentially an adaptive homodyne measurement , similar to refs .",
    "@xcite . here , after detections with interaction times",
    "down to @xmath89 , the phase information has only been obtained modulo @xmath97 .",
    "this means that the only nonzero fourier coefficients @xmath98 are those where @xmath99 .",
    "this is advantageous for computation , because it means that only those coefficients need be recorded .",
    "however , it means that one can not use @xmath100 for an estimate of the phase ( unless @xmath101 ) .",
    "instead one can use @xmath102 for an estimate of the phase modulo @xmath97 ; that is , it is an estimate of @xmath32 .",
    "taking @xmath83 to be an estimate of @xmath32 plus @xmath25 yields the point where the probabilities in eq .",
    "are most sensitive to @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , this adaptive homodyne approach performs very poorly with reduced visibility of the interference .",
    "recently , a variation was proposed by cappellaro @xcite for this type of phase estimation , in which the controlled phase is updated only after each change of interaction time .",
    "that is , when the interaction time is changed from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , the controlled phase is taken to be @xmath105 an estimate of @xmath32 is obtained as @xmath106 .",
    "this is then divided by 2 to obtain an estimate of @xmath107 , as is needed because one has @xmath108 in the argument of the cosine in eq .  .",
    "note that there is ambiguity modulo @xmath67 in the estimate of @xmath107 , but this is unimportant because adding @xmath67 yields equivalent results .",
    "specifically , adding @xmath67 exchanges the probabilities for detection results @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "hence , if @xmath67 is added and the detection result is @xmath110 , the following calculations are the same as if @xmath67 were not added and the detection result was @xmath109 .",
    "this means that the same variance must be obtained regardless of whether @xmath67 is added .",
    "note that the formula does not have @xmath25 in it , so it does not give the point where the probabilities are most sensitive to @xmath33 .",
    "however , it turns out that when @xmath25 is not used , this is the phase that minimises the variance after the next detection ( after the change in interaction time ) .",
    "this can be verified using the formula in ref .",
    "to find an improved adaptive protocol for this type of phase estimation system , we applied numerical optimisation to minimise the variance estimated by repeated simulations .",
    "several different optimisation algorithms were tested , included non - linear programming methods and simulated annealing , however we found that the procedure which gave the best result in a reasonable amount of time was particle swarm optimisation ( pso ) , which was also used in @xcite .",
    "a comparison of some example results from the three different techniques are shown in fig .",
    "these calculations were for all the same interaction time @xmath30 . because @xmath0 is the total interaction time divided by @xmath30 , here it is the number of detections .",
    "for this example @xmath42 was taken to be infinite for simplicity .",
    "approximately the same calculation times were allowed in each case .",
    "matlab s inbuilt optimisation routine produced the largest variances .",
    "simulated annealing produced somewhat improved results , and pso produced the smallest variance .",
    "the pso algorithm uses a group of interacting ` particles ' to search the phase space of the problem .",
    "each particle has a velocity which is updated with semi - random adjustments that are dependent on best values found by both the individual particle and by the entire group .",
    "the formula for the velocity update is @xmath111,\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the particle position , @xmath113 is the particle velocity , and @xmath114 is the updated velocity .",
    "the variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the currently known global and local optimums , respectively , @xmath117 is an overall damping factor to ensure convergence , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are set weightings for the current global and local optimums respectively , and @xmath120 and @xmath121 are random numbers that are chosen uniformly in the interval @xmath122 at each step .",
    "we used @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "these are the weighting values recommended by kennedy and eberhart @xcite , the developers of the algorithm , and we found these to perform relatively well .",
    "the space consisted of the phase increments after each detection .",
    "that is , after each detection there was an increment in the controlled phase @xmath83 that depended on the number of the stage and the detection result , but not on prior results .",
    "the position is the set of these phase increments .",
    "the initial positions were chosen uniformly at random in the space .",
    "the initial velocities were chosen uniformly at random , with the maximum velocity corresponding to half the size of the space per iteration .",
    "the maximum velocity tended to act as a soft bound on the area covered , as the particles would usually stay within an area of dimensions that were roughly three times the maximum velocity .",
    "we used fixed boundaries , since we were examining a domain equivalent to one full phase rotation .",
    "the phase space had reflective boundaries to prevent a trapping effect near the edges .",
    "the simulations used 10 particles ; we tested higher numbers of particles , but it did not improve the performance .",
    "the maximum number of iterations was set at 300 to allow the particles to fully converge .",

    ", we used a sample size of at least @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) , intended to be sufficiently large to ensure accurate results while still being tractable for the computation equipment we used . in order to reduce the random variation just due to the sampling",
    ", we used the same set of random numbers each time . at the end",
    "we used a different set of random numbers to obtain the final estimate of the variance .",
    "this is to ensure that the small variance was not just an artefact of the particular random numbers used .    for our optimised adaptive stepping , the optimisation program allowed for asymmetric steps , meaning that the size and direction of a step after a detection outcome is independent of the step resulting from the alternative outcome .",
    "this also means that we were required to optimise over twice as many variables .",
    "a further consideration was the number of detections for each interaction time . for most of the results",
    ", we used the values @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which were found to be sufficiently large to give improved scaling at high visibility , while also being useful for comparison with results from other work , such as @xcite .",

    "@xcite ( see fig .  3 of that work ) .    note that @xmath82 is proportional to the square of the dynamic range ; that is , @xmath133 this means that the limit to the dynamic range for equal measurement times corresponds to @xmath132 being constant .",
    "similarly , the ultimate limit to the dynamic range in corresponds to @xmath132 scaling as @xmath2 .",
    "these limits are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : non ] and [ fig : opt ] for reference .",
    "it can be seen that for the nonadaptive measurement the results are quite similar to what could be obtained for equal interaction times .",
    "an improved result is obtained by only updating the controlled phase each time the interaction time is reduced , according to the cappellaro approach discussed above .",
    "this yields a result that beats the equal - interaction - time limit for visibility of both @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "it has a scaling quite similar to the ultimate limit , though it is a significant distance above the line ( about a factor of @xmath136 ) .",
    "the alternative values @xmath137",
    ", @xmath138 , which yield fewer detections for each interaction time , also give much higher variances .",
    "the phase variances obtained using the pso method to choose the controlled phases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] .",
    "this improves on the phase update based on cappellaro s technique for visibility of @xmath134 , but not for @xmath135 visibility . to improve the performance , we tested a combined protocol using both optimised adaptive steps and a phase update based on the bayesian distribution at each change in interaction time",
    "this method outperformed all others for both visibilities examined .",

    "the nonadaptive measurements gave better results , but when the initial visibility is too small even nonadaptive measurements perform poorly .",
    "a partially adaptive scheme was proposed by cappellaro , which provided some improvement @xcite .",
    "here we have used pso to find a hybrid technique , that uses the adaptive step from cappellaro , as well as optimising the other adaptive steps in the measurement .",

    "it is also possible to use pso to search for an adaptive technique , without also using the cappellaro update step . in principle",
    "this should give the best result , but in practice it did not converge sufficiently well . for initial visibility of @xmath134 , it still gave an improvement over the cappellaro technique , but it performed very poorly for @xmath135 visibility .",
    "for these results we have not optimised over the number of detections for each interaction time .",

    "<S> adaptive feedback normally provides the greatest accuracy for optical phase measurements . </S>",
    "<S> new advances in nitrogen vacancy centre  technology have enabled magnetometry via individual spin measurements , which are similar to optical phase measurements but with low visibility . the adaptive measurements that previously worked well with high - visibility optical interferometry break down and give poor results for nitrogen vacancy centre   measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we use advanced search techniques based on swarm optimisation to design better adaptive measurements that can provide improved measurement accuracy with low - visibility interferometry , with applications in nitrogen vacancy centre   magnetometry . </S>"
