    "this range of ages makes the ob associations the most suitable laboratory for studies of protoplanetary disk evolution , because it encompasses the time span in which giant planets are expected to form ( pollack et al .",

    "we found ages of @xmath8 3 - 5 myr for ori ob1b and @xmath8 7 - 10 myr for ori ob1a , confirming age determinations based on the ob stars ( blaauw 1964 ; warren & hesser 1977 , 1978 ; brown et al .",
    "we also found that ori ob1b could be identified with a population associated with a ring of low density gas and dust , probably formed by a supernova event , with most of the classical t tauri stars ( i.e. , stars accreting from circumstellar disks ; ctts ) near the ring , similar to the case of @xmath11 ori ( dolan & mathieu 1999 , 2001 , 2002 ) .",

    "thus , we measured instrumental magnitudes with the iraf apphot package , using an aperture radius of 6 pixels , and a sky annulus with inner and outer radii of 10 and 20 pixels respectively , for both orion and standard stars . after obtaining the zero points and color terms ( which were small ) we arrived at an @xmath1-band @xmath31 error = 0.07 mags , mostly dominated by measurement errors",

    "no flat fielding was performed .",
    "the oscir array is very flat over the small number of pixels within the point spread function .",

    "because most of the orion stars were not detected at @xmath42 m , we used consecutive pairs of @xmath41 m and @xmath42 m @xmath43 cma images to determine average offset positions between the two filters , and used these to place the aperture at the predicted position in the @xmath42 m images of the orion stars . in this way we measured upper limits to the flux in this band .",

    "the galactic coordinates of stars in the photometric sample are plotted in figure [ fig_galactic ] compared to the entire sample in paper i. the stars are projected against the map of integrated @xmath48co emissivity from bally et al .",

    "here we adopt the boundaries of ori ob1b from paper i , shown in figure [ fig_galactic ] . however , there is some uncertainty in the actual membership of stars located near the assumed boundary between ori ob1a and 1b at @xmath51 , @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , with the adopted boundaries , 2 stars of the sample fall in ori ob1c , in the region of high molecular gas density ; however , they are so close to the uncertain boundary that we include them in ori ob1b for the rest of the analysis .",
    "we took the spectral types of the sample stars from paper i and recalculate here stellar properties from the simultaneous multiwavelength photometry to minimize effects of variability .",
    "we used the average distances of 330 pc for ori ob1a and 440 for ori ob1b , as discussed in paper i. the extinctions @xmath54 in table [ tab_prop ] are calculated from the @xmath55 color , using the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction law with @xmath56 = 3.1 .",
    "the mean extinctions for 1a , 1b , 1c , and the entire sample are 0.5 , 0.6 , 2 , and 0.6 , respectively . using individual extinctions , we recalculated stellar luminosities @xmath1 and radii @xmath57 .",

    "ctts and wtts are shown separately , and the ctts in ori ob1a are marked .",
    "note that the two observations for stars cvso 35 , 146 , and 190 are plotted as different points .",
    "the wtts in the sample are consistent with main sequence colors , reddened by @xmath8 0.5 - 0.6 magnitudes of extinction , as expected from the average @xmath54 of the sample .",
    "the ctts have similar @xmath55 as the wtts , but show large excesses relative to the wtts in @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these excesses are expected to arise from emission of the accretion shock formed as material accreting from the disk strikes the stellar surface ( hartigan et al .",
    "1991 ; hartigan , edwards , & ghandour 1995 ; calvet & gullbring 1998 ) .    in figures [ figviuv ] and [ figviub ] we also plot a sample of stars in taurus taken from kh95 , equally separated in wtts and ctts .",
    "the age of the taurus association has been analyzed in detail by hartmann ( 2003 ) , who showed that most of the stars have ages of @xmath8 1 - 2 myr . with the ages for the subassociations found in paper i , i.e. @xmath8 3 - 5 myr for ori ob1b and @xmath8 7 - 10 myr for ob1a , the taurus population is younger than ori ob1b by @xmath8 2 - 3 myr , and than ori ob1a by @xmath8 6 - 8 myr , so it provides an initial reference point to study evolutionary effects .",
    "the orion ob1 and taurus stars encompass a similar range of @xmath55 in figures [ figviuv ] and [ figviub ] , indicating that we are probing the same range of stellar masses .",
    "the samples of ori ob1b and taurus show a similar range in @xmath59 and @xmath60 excesses relative to photospheric colors ; the lowest excesses correspond to stars in ori ob1a , some of them compatible with measurements for the wtts .    in figure [ fighkub ]",
    "we show the ori ob1 sample in the @xmath60 vs. @xmath4 diagram , indicating the standard main sequence colors with values from kh95 .",
    "we have used the transformations from carpenter ( 2001 ) to convert the 2mass @xmath61 colors to the cit system . a sample of taurus stars , with colors from kh95 is also shown .",
    "it is apparent that the excesses in @xmath4 relative to photospheric colors in ori ob1b are smaller than those found in the taurus sample .",
    "moreover , the excesses in @xmath4 in ori ob1a , the oldest of the three populations shown , are even smaller than in ori ob1b .",
    "this effect is more apparent in the @xmath60 vs. @xmath5 diagram , shown in figure [ figklub ] , using the @xmath5 colors of the ctts in ori ob1 in table [ tab_photometry ] .",
    "we use here @xmath62 for the orion ob1 stars .",
    "colors for the taurus stars and for the main sequence are from kh95 .",
    "the color excesses in @xmath5 relative to the main sequence in the ori ob1 stars are clearly smaller than those in taurus .    finally , we locate the 6 stars observed with gemini / oscir in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath5 diagram in figure [ figknkl ] , and compare it to the taurus sample .",
    "the ori ob1 stars are located at the low end of the taurus ctts distribution , and even tend to populate the clear gap between ctts and tts noticed by kh95 ( the three taurus stars inside the gap are binaries , kh95 ) .",
    "these comparisons clearly indicate a decrease of ir emission at @xmath63 m with age . a significant decrease of @xmath4 and @xmath5 with with age is also found in a sample of clusters and groupings by hillenbrand , carpenter , & meyer ( 2004 , in preparation ) ; sicilia - aguilar et al . ( 2004 , in preparation ) observe a similar near - ir flux deficit relative to taurus in spitzer / irac colors of the @xmath8 5 myr cluster tr 37 .",
    "ir emission at @xmath63 m arises in the inner disks in t tauri stars , @xmath64 few au , which are sufficiently hot to produce such emission ( meyer et al . 1997 ; dalessio et al . 1998 ; 1999 ; 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the observed decrease of fluxes with age must be related to physical phenomena occurring in these inner regions of the disks as a result of disk evolution .",
    "we will explore possible implications of these results in ",
    "[ sec_discussion ] .",
    "analyses of color - color diagrams in  [ sec_colcol ] indicate a clear difference between emission of the disks in ori ob1 and in taurus ; disks in the orion ob1 stars emit less flux at near - infrared wavelengths than typical disks in taurus .",
    "the comparison is seen clearly in figure [ fig_seds ] , where we plot the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the stars observed with gemini oscir , including the measurement and upper limits at 18 @xmath2 m from table [ tab_oscir ] .",
    "optical and near - ir fluxes have been calculated from magnitudes in table [ tab_photometry ] and corrected for reddening in table [ tab_prop ] .",
    "these seds are compared with the median sed of ctts in taurus ( dalessio et al .",
    "2001 ) , scaled to the flux at @xmath65 of each star .",
    "the error bars in the median show the first quartiles of the distribution ( i.e. , 50% of the taurus stars fall within the error bars ) .",
    "the seds of the orion stars show excesses relative to the photosphere , consistent with the fact that the sample observed with gemini was selected on the basis of being bright at @xmath66 and have large @xmath4 excesses . however , even with this selection bias , the ori ob1 disks are fainter than @xmath8 50 - 75 % of the taurus sample in the mid - ir .",
    "we interpret the excesses in @xmath60 and @xmath59 relative to photospheric fluxes in the ctts in ori ob1a and 1b as due to emission from the accretion shock on the stellar surface ( hartigan et al .",
    "1991 ; hartigan , edwards , & ghandour 1995 ; gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ; calvet & gullbring 1998 ) .",
    "in the framework of this interpretation , the excess luminosity above photospheric colors is a measure of the accretion luminosity released as matter falls from the disk onto the star , following the magnetic field lines that disrupt the disk ( cf . hartmann 1988 ) .",
    "we used the de - reddened @xmath3 photometry and spectral types to obtain the excess luminosity in u above the intrinsic photospheric fluxes , @xmath67 ; this luminosity was used to estimate the accretion luminosity @xmath68 , using the calibration of gullbring et al .",
    "these estimates are listed in table [ tab_prop ] .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the determination of @xmath67 , and thus @xmath69 , comes from uncertainties in the determination of the extinction @xmath54 , and it amounts to @xmath70% .",
    "using @xmath71 , ( assuming a radius of @xmath72 for the magnetospheric radius ; calvet & gullbring 1998 ) , with the mass and radius determined from the location in the hr diagram , we can infer the mass accretion rate @xmath73 of the objects .",
    "these rates are listed in table [ tab_prop ] .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in @xmath68 , the formal uncertainty in @xmath73 includes errors in radius and mass , which are of order 15 - 20% ; thus , the mass accretion rates are constrained within a factor of 2 . given the uncertainties in the original calibration between @xmath67 and @xmath69 ,",
    "this uncertainty can be a factor of 2 larger ( gullbring et al .",
    "as the errors are uncorrelated , the total error amounts to a factor of 3 .    in figure [ fig_distmdot ]",
    "we show histograms with the number of objects per bin of log @xmath73 , each of size 0.5 , for the three populations , ori ob1a at the top , 1b at the middle , and taurus at the bottom .",
    "the mass accretion rates in taurus are taken from gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and hartmann et al .",
    "these measurements of @xmath73 were obtained from @xmath68 using masses estimated with the dantona & mazitelli ( 1994 ) evolutionary tracks ; we have recalculated them using masses for the taurus stars estimated with the siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) evolutionary tracks , for consistency with the work presented here .",
    "the actual values of @xmath73 in bins with @xmath74 are highly uncertain . at these levels ,",
    "emission due to stellar surface activity becomes an important or dominant contributor to the u excess , as comparison with the wtts in the sample shows .",
    "in these cases , the determined values are upper limits to the true @xmath73s .",
    "the age of the three populations shown increases from bottom to top .",
    "in all three cases , there is a large spread in the ranges of values of @xmath73 .",
    "however , as time proceeds , the number of rapid accretors decreases , only the low accretors remain in 1a .",
    "one `` continuum '' star is found in ori ob1b ( see table [ tab_prop ] ) ; we did not have enough spectral resolution to distinguish spectral features and thus determine its spectral type and derived properties .",
    "this continuum star does not appear in figure [ fig_distmdot ] ; if its properties were similar to those of continuum stars in taurus , then it could have @xmath75 few @xmath76 ( gullbring et al . 1998 ; calvet & gullbring 1998 ; gullbring et al .",
    "however , even including this star , the relative number of rapid accretors in ori ob1b would be smaller than in taurus .",
    "we compared the distributions of log @xmath73 in the three regions using a two - sided ks test .",
    "the results indicated that the probability that the ori ob1b and taurus samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution is only 3% ; the same is true for ori ob1b vs. ori ob1a .",
    "for a further test , we have added the continuum star in ori ob1b to the distribution , assuming a a mass accretion rate of @xmath77 ; even in this case , the probability that the ori ob1b sample is drawn from the same distribution as taurus is only marginally larger , 9% .",
    "thus we conclude that the distributions of accretion rates are significantly different between the three regions .",

    "we also plot in figure [ fig_mdot ] similar data for taurus , @xmath78 ophiucus and chameleon ( hartmann et al . 1998 ) , and the tw hya association ( twa , muzerolle et al . 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "all masses and mass accretion rates of these latter objects have been re - calibrated using the siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) evolutionary tracks .",
    "the mass accretion rates of the disks in ori ob1 are consistent with those in other associations , and show a clear decrease with age .",
    "the star cvso 41 in ori ob1a has an apparent age of 88 myr ( table [ tab_prop ] ) and still shows a fairly high value of @xmath73 .",
    "the spectral type of this star is k2 , so it could have a large age uncertainty .",
    "it is known that pre - main - sequence stars in this spectral type range tend to have higher apparent ages than cooler objects ( hillenbrand 1997 ) ; this behavior has been attributed to uncertainties in the birthline location ( hartmann 2003 ) .    the solid line in figure [ fig_mdot ] shows the decay of @xmath73 with time expected from viscous evolution for a disk with initial mass @xmath79 and viscous parameter @xmath80 , from hartmann et al .",
    "the new values of @xmath73 help confirm a decrease of @xmath73 with age qualitatively consistent with viscous disk evolution .",
    "however , viscous evolution can not explain the decreasing fraction of accreting objects with age ( muzerolle et al . 2000 ; briceo et al .",
    "2004 ) ; other factors ( i.e. , inner disk clearing associated with planet formation , calvet et al . 2002 ; rice et al . 2003 ; dalessio et al .",
    "2004 ) must play a role in slowing accretion onto the central star .",
    "in our comparison of disk properties in three populations with ages @xmath8 1 - 2 myr ( taurus ) , 3 - 5 myr ( ori ob1b ) , and 7 - 10 myr ( ori ob1a ) , we have found a clear decrease of disk emission with age .",
    "this decrease is apparent at all wavelengths with expected substantial disk contribution to the emission , from @xmath65 to 18@xmath2 m .",
    "the disk emission in the ir depends on the temperature of the dust .",
    "the two main heating mechanisms active on disks around young stars are viscous dissipation and stellar irradiation ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 , kh87 ;",
    "dalessio et al . 1998 , 1999 , 2001 ,",
    "viscous dissipation depends on the mass accretion rate throughout the disk ; for the range of stellar parameters of stars in ori ob1 , and for @xmath81 , which characterize these stars (  [ sec_mdots ] ) , viscous heating is important only near the midplane of the innermost disk , @xmath82 1 au ( dalessio et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "thus , absorption of stellar radiation by dust in the disks around the ori ob1 stars mostly determines their temperature and emission .    one important development in recent years is the recognition that the near - ir fluxes in accretion disks around pre - main sequence stars are dominated by emission from a sharp transition between dust and gas at the dust destruction radius . at this transition ,",
    "the optically thick dust disk is high enough to form a `` wall '' , which is frontally illuminated by the star .",
    "opacities in the inner gas disk are due to molecules and are much lower than the dust opacities for typically low mas accretion rates ; thus , the gas disk is optically thin , enabling frontal illumination of the wall ( muzerolle et al .",
    "the existence of this wall was proposed for herbig ae / be stars ( natta et al .",
    "2001 ; tuthill , monnier & danchi 2001 ; dullemond , dominik , & natta et al .",
    "2001 ) to explain the peculiar `` bump '' at @xmath83 m observed in the seds of these stars ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "interferometric measurements of inner disk structures in herbig ae / be stars confirmed this prediction ( millan - gabet et al . 1999 ; monnier & millan - gabet 2002 ) .",
    "a similar wall emission was then reported in the low mass ctts by muzerolle et al .",
    "in contrast to their higher mass counterparts , ctts can have accretion luminosities of the same order as the stellar luminosities , thus increasing the total energy output and moving outwards the disk location where the temperature is equal to the dust destruction temperature for objects with high values of @xmath68 .",
    "the rapid accretors are therefore expected to have the wall located at larger radius than objects with low @xmath73 , increasing the total emitting area of the wall and thus the near - ir excess ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2003 ; dalessio et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed by the keck interferometer measurement of an inner structure at the expected location of the dust destruction radius in a high accretion ctts ( colavita et al .",
    "2003 ; dalessio et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "according to this model , the near - ir excess depends on the strength of the wall emission relative to photospheric fluxes .",
    "this emission is approximately that of a black - body at the dust destruction temperature , @xmath84 1400k ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2003 ) , times the solid angle subtended by the wall .",
    "this solid angle is essentially that of a cylinder of given height , and radius equal to the dust destruction radius , with an inclination dependence which makes the emission maximum at intermediate lines of sight ( 60@xmath85 - 80@xmath85 ) where the wall has maximum exposure ( dullemond et al .",
    "2001 ; dalessio et al .",
    "the dust destruction radius is essentially @xmath86 ( dalessio et al .",
    "the height of the wall @xmath87 is estimated as the height where the radial optical depth from the star becomes @xmath8 1 ( see muzerolle et al .",
    "2004 ) .    we can examine the decrease of near - ir excesses with age in terms of these ideas .",
    "as they age , pre - main sequence low mass stars move down along hayashi tracks essentially at constant @xmath88 while decreasing in luminosity . as @xmath73 decreases , @xmath68 becomes much smaller than @xmath89 , so the dust destruction radius becomes fixed relative to the stellar radius , @xmath90 const . if the height of the wall is a fixed multiple of the disk scale height at @xmath91 , which in turn is typically @xmath92 , then the emitting area of the wall , @xmath93 , and thus its total energy output , would decrease in the same proportion as the stellar output , namely @xmath94 . in this case , no decrease of near - ir excess relative to the photosphere with time would be expected . since @xmath95 const , the most natural way to explain the observed decrease is that the height of the wall @xmath87 decreases with time . for this to happen",
    ", the opacity at the upper levels of the wall has to decrease , which implies that dust grains at the top of the wall significantly grow and/or settle towards the midplane as age increases .    grain growth and/or settling towards the midplane in the disk regions outside the wall also result in low mid - ir fluxes .",
    "the disk is heated by stellar + accretion energy captured at the disk surface .",
    "thus , heating of the disk depends on the shape of this surface ; the more `` flared '' the surface is , the more energy it can capture ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 , kh87 ) ; disks with highly flared surfaces are hotter and thus emit more . to be more specific , the height of the surface @xmath96 at a given radius",
    "is given by the condition that the radial optical since the density decreases with vertical height above the midplane , @xmath96 decreases as the opacity of the dust in the upper layers decreases .",
    "small grains have high opacity at wavelengths characteristic of the stellar radiation , in the optical and near - ir .",
    "they produce a highly flared surface , which results in high energy capture , and hot and bright disks .",
    "in contrast , large grains have low opacity at short wavelengths .",
    "they produce flatter surfaces , which result in less energy capture and cooler and fainter disks ( dalessio et al .",
    "2001 , d01 ) .",
    "alternatively , the opacity at upper layers may be reduced because grains are settling to the midplane .",
    "this also results in flatter surfaces and fainter disks in the infrared ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ; dalessio et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) . both growth and settling",
    "are expected to occur together .",
    "dust particles , affected by gas drag , collide and stick together ; as the particles grow , they settle towards the midplane , falling under the effect of gravity ( weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ; weidenschilling 1997 ) . these theories have many unknown parameters , and so far predict time scales for complete settling @xmath82 1 myr ; however , the timescales depend upon the magnitude of turbulence in disks , which could retard or prevent settling .",
    "a number of claims of grain growth in disks have been made over the years , starting with the interpretation of slopes of the fluxes in the millimeter , which are expected to become flatter as the grain size increases ( beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . assuming a dust mixture and a dust size distribution of the form @xmath97 between minimum and maximum sizes @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ", d01 find that a much better fit to the median sed of taurus can be achieved with dust particle growth to a maximum size @xmath99 of 1 mm ( @xmath100=3.5 ) than with interstellar grains , with @xmath101 m .",
    "grain growth and settling has been claimed to explain the seds of some ctts in taurus .",
    "one well studied case is that of the ctts lkca 15 , which has a sed much flatter than the taurus median in the ir and high emission at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths ( qi et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the interpretation of this sed requires significant grain growth and settling ( chiang et al .",
    "2001 ; dalessio et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ; bergin et al .",
    "2004 ) . in figures",
    "[ figviuv ] , [ figviub ] , [ fighkub ] , [ figklub ] , and [ figknkl ] we have marked the location of lkca 15 ; disks in ori ob1 have similar colors to those of lkca 15 in all bands , suggesting that significant dust evolution has also taken place in these older disks . in figure [ fig_est109",
    "] we compare the sed of cvso 109 , the only object for which we have detections up to 18@xmath2 m , to fluxes for lkca 15 from kh95 and to the taurus median , both scaled at the @xmath65 of cvso 109 .",
    "note that lkca 15 is a k5 star ( kh95 ) , so it is brighter in the optical than cvso 109 , which is an m0 ( table [ tab_prop ] ) .",
    "the seds of lkca 15 and cvso 109 are significantly lower than the taurus median , although the flux deficit is much larger in cvso 109 .    to try to quantify the degree of dust evolution in cvso 109 ,",
    "we have calculated models with uniformly distributed gas and dust following the procedures of d01 . we have used stellar and accretion parameters from table [ tab_prop ] , and have varied the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 which characterize the dust size distribution .",
    "figure [ fig_est109 ] shows our best model .",
    "to fit the observed fluxes , we require @xmath99 = 10 cm ; this is higher than the maximum sizes required to explain the median sed in taurus , @xmath102 1 mm ( d01 ) , or the sed of the @xmath8 10 myr old star tw hya , @xmath102 1 cm ( calvet et al . 2002 ; wilner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , we require @xmath103 , a value consistent with significant dust coagulation ( miyake & nakagawa 1995 ) ; modeling of ctts disks can generally be carried out successfully with the assumption of @xmath104 3.5 , a value characteristic of the interstellar medium ( cf .",
    "d01 , chiang et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "our modeling is only indicative , in that we have assumed that the dust is uniformly distributed with the gas .",
    "even with this assumption , our comparison implies that the disk of cvso 109 is essentially a flat disk , with little if any flaring .",
    "thus , our modeling indicates that the dust in the disk of cvso 109 has strongly settled towards the midplane , as expected from theories of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks ( weidenschilling 1997 ) .",
    "models including settling in addition to observations at longer wavelengths are required to actually constrain the size distribution of the solids in the midplane .",
    "a possible alternative to consider is that disks in ori ob1 are smaller than their taurus counterparts because their outer parts have been photoevaporated by the external ionizing fields of the high mass stars in the associations .",
    "a smaller disk would have less emission at long wavelengths since the low temperature regions would be removed .",
    "models for the viscous evolution of disks subject to the effects of photoevaporating radiation fields from the accretion flows and external radiation fields have been calculated by clarke , gendrin , & sotomayor ( 2001 ) and matsuyama , johnston & hartmann ( 2003 ) . since the distance from the ionizing stars are of the order of a few pc in ob associations , fuv external photons",
    "are expected to dominate over euv photons in the photoevaporation of disks ( johnstone et al .",
    "1998 ) . for this case ,",
    "matsuyama et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that that the outer portions of the disk could be removed on time scales which range from 1 to several myr , depending on the viscosity parameter .",
    "after significant photoevaporation , the disk edge is fixed by the fuv gravitational radius , which for parameters as those of the ori ob1b stellar sample is @xmath8 30 au . to determine the effects of a reduction of disk radius on the sed , and in particular to see if a smaller disk radius can explain the low mid - infrared fluxes without extreme grain growth , we have calculated disk models with @xmath99 = 1 mm and @xmath100 = 3.5 , characteristic of the taurus population , for disk radii 100 au , 50 au , and 10 au .",
    "these seds are shown in figure [ figsmalldisk ] .",
    "models are calculated at a high inclination to the line of sight ( @xmath105 ) to maximize the contrast between the star and the disk .",
    "even small disks produce too much long wavelength flux compared to the the observations , if @xmath99 = 1 mm as in taurus .",
    "this implies again that the disk has to be essentially flat , which require that grains grow to larger sizes and/or have settled .",
    "we have detected clear signatures of disk evolution in samples of accreting stars in the ori ob1a and 1b associations , with ages 7 - 10 myr and 3 - 5 myr , respectively .",
    "the mass accretion rates of these stars are consistent with viscous evolution of accretion disks . in addition",
    ", we find a significant overall decrease of infrared emission with age .",
    "comparison with disk models indicates that grain growth and settling , processes expected from dust evolution , are responsible for this decrease .",
