    "quantum tunneling under a potential barrier is a part of a variety of physical processes .",
    "the computation of the probability for a classically forbidden region has a certain peculiarity from the mathematical standpoint : there necessarily arises here the concept of motion in imaginary time or along a complex trajectory @xcite .",
    "the famous semiclassical approach of wentzel , kramers , and brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite for tunneling probability can be easily reformulated in terms of classical trajectories in the complex time .",
    "the method of complex trajectories is also applicable to a non - stationary case @xcite .",
    "this method has been further developed in papers @xcite , where singularities of the trajectories in the complex plane were accounted for an arbitrary potential barrier ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recent achievements in the semiclassical theory are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a control of tunneling processes by external signal is a part of the field called quantum control which is actively developed now , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "excitations of molecules , when one should excite only particular chemical bonds @xcite , a control of acoustic waves in solids @xcite , formation of programmable atomic wave packets @xcite , a control of electron states in heterostructures @xcite , and a control of photo current in semiconductors @xcite , are typical examples of control by laser pulses .",
    "let us focus on main aspects of tunneling under nonstationary conditions . when the electric field @xmath1 acts on a tunneling particle of the initial energy @xmath2 , it can absorb the quantum @xmath3 ( with the probability proportional to the small parameter @xmath4 ) and tunnel after that in the more transparent part of the barrier with the higher energy @xmath5 .",
    "the pay in the absorption probability may be compensated by the probability gain in tunneling . in this case",
    "the system tends to absorb further quanta to low the total probability of barrier penetration .",
    "if @xmath3 is not big , the process of tunneling , with a simultaneous multi - quanta absorption , can be described in a semiclassical way by the method of classical trajectories in the complex time @xcite . when a tunneling particle of the energy @xmath2 is acted by a short - time signal ,",
    "the particle energy after escape is @xmath6 , where the energy gain @xmath7 , should be extremized with respect to the number of absorbed quanta @xmath8 and the energy @xmath9 of each quantum .",
    "this extreme corresponds to the method of classical trajectories @xcite .    according to the perturbation theory ,",
    "the both probabilities , of absorption and emission of a quantum , are small being proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "after absorption , @xmath10 is positive which enhances the total probability due to the increase of the tunneling rate .",
    "after emission , @xmath10 is negative and the particle should tunnel with a smaller energy in a less transparent part of the barrier ; in this case there is no gain in the probability due to tunneling as for absorption . at first sight ,",
    "tunneling in a nonstationary field can not be assisted by an emission of quanta of this field since one should pay in probability twice .",
    "this conclusion is correct as soon as the nonstationary field is small and the perturbation theory is applicable",
    ". for tunneling the perturbation theory with respect to a non - stationary field stops to be valid already for very small fields @xcite .",
    "what happens to emission - assisted tunneling when the nonstationary field is not very small ?    for a not very small nonstationary field the perturbation approach should be substituted by the semiclassical one . in this approach",
    "a multi - quanta absorption is accounted by classical trajectories in the complex time and the transition probability @xmath11 is expressed through the classical action @xmath12 calculated by means of those trajectories .",
    "this differs from the the stationary case described by the wkb formula @xmath13 $ ] . the particle with the initial energy @xmath2 emits quanta , `` dives '' on the level @xmath14 , and proceeds the penetration with this energy during the certain time interval @xmath15 .",
    "the `` diving '' process does not contribute much to the action @xmath12 ( in contrast to the perturbation theory ) but the further motion adds @xmath16 and the term @xmath17 .",
    "the last term is analogous to the occupation one , @xmath18 , when the temperature @xmath19 is substituted by @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "as shown in the paper , under some conditions of the nonstationary signal the `` diving '' process is instant in the complex time and weakly contributes to the total action .",
    "the condition of the instant `` diving '' is not necessary for the strong reduction of @xmath12 .",
    "the emission - assisted tunneling exhibits a surprising feature : under action of the certain signal the tunneling rate can be not exponentially small since the action can tend to zero ( @xmath21 ) at some energy @xmath0 which depends on the signal parameters .",
    "the negative term @xmath22 in the action plays an important role in the dramatic reduction of the action @xmath12 under certain conditions . according to this ,",
    "the tunneling rate @xmath11 reaches a sharp maximum at the energy @xmath0 . the method used implies formally a small probability @xmath23 but it can be of the order of @xmath24 instead of an extremely small value . in an anharmonic potential",
    "well a classical or quantum particle of the energy @xmath2 , acted by the signal @xmath1 , can exhibit a resonance if to adapt the frequency @xmath3 to the energy @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "analogously , to get a maximum tunnel penetration at some given initial energy @xmath2 of the particle , the external signal should be adapted to this energy . in the first case a motion occurs in real time but in the second case one should use imaginary ( complex ) time to describe the process .",
    "traditionally , an action in imaginary time is called the euclidean action which comes from relativity where the geometry is euclidean in imaginary time . extending this analogy",
    ", one can call the above tunnel phenomenon the euclidean resonance .",
    "a scenario of the euclidean resonance is the following : the particle with the energy @xmath2 , before the barrier , leaves it having the exit energy @xmath6 which is less than @xmath2 ; the position of the exit wave packet in time is close to the peak of the signal and the duration of the exit wave packet is roughly the under - barrier time @xmath25 ; during this time interval the tunneling rate is not exponentially small for energies @xmath26 .",
    "this means that under action of a specially adapted signals a particle can penetrate through very non - transparent barriers ( big @xmath27 .",
    "one should emphasize , this process corresponds to a motion deep under a barrier but not a transition over its top .",
    "as shown in the paper , the signal amplitude , required for the euclidean resonance , can be very small comparing to an electric field of the static barrier .    in secs .",
    "ii - iv the problem of the euclidean resonance for a decay of the metastable state in the @xmath28-potential well is solved exactly in the semiclassical sense .",
    "this means that for the wave function @xmath29 $ ] ( we use @xmath30 in this relation ) the action @xmath31 , the first , and the second non - semiclassical correction @xmath32 and @xmath33 have been found exactly in the analytical forms .",
    "the developed method enables to write down the exact expression for any @xmath34 . in sec .",
    "v the semiclassical condition @xmath35 is obtained . in sec .",
    "vi the method of complex trajectories is shown to be valid for the problem . in secs .",
    "viii - ix the method of complex trajectories is applied to the euclidean resonance in a smooth potential . in sec .",
    "xi some particular manifestations of the resonance are considered .",
    "it can be used for a selective stimulation of chemical reactions . for alpha - decay of nuclei",
    "the experimentally registered energies of alpha - particles range in the approximate interval of 2 - 10 mev . for lower energies",
    "the tunneling probability is very low which makes observations to be impossible .",
    "however , there is no a principal ban for the soft alpha - decay , for example , with the energies of alpha - particles of the order of 1 kev .",
    "the energy , counted from the bottom of the nuclear potential well , remains of the order of mev .",
    "adapting an external signal , with the duration of one or ten femtoseconds , to a possible energy level of an alpha - particle , one can try to search the soft alpha - decay . in principle",
