    "gravity , thermodynamics and quantum mechanics form a knot where much of what we do not yet understand about the world appears to hide . here",
    "we focus on the relation between the first two strands of the knot , gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "it has been repeatedly pointed out that while statistical mechanics on a given curved spacetime is fairly clear , a theory of the full statistical mechanics of the gravitational field is not yet available .",
    "we understand the statistical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field ( for instance with black - body theory ) , but not those of the gravitational field , beyond the linear approximation .",
    "we think that this is one of the reasons for the puzzling aspects in several of the current speculations on the relation between thermodynamics and gravity @xcite .",
    "standard thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are based on notions ( such as a preferred time ) which have no equivalent in a general - covariant theory , where coordinate - time evolution is gauge and there is no preferred time flow .",
    "what is equilibrium in this context ? what is thermalization ?",
    "what is equipartition of energy , if gravitational energy is such a slippery concept as it is in general relativity ?",
    "a line of thinking on these problems , and one that works towards constructing a coherent general - covariant statistical mechanics , is based on the idea of thermal time @xcite .",
    "the idea is to reinterpret the relation between time flow ( generated by the hamiltonian @xmath0 ) and gibbs states @xmath1 , by viewing the first as being determined by the second rather than the second determined by the first .",
    "the time flow with respect to which a covariant state is in equilibrium can be read out from the state itself , and the germ of temporality is traced to quantum non - commutativity @xcite .    the main problem that this approach leaves open is characterizing equilibrium , distinguishing thermal states from general statistical ones . here",
    "we address this problem by going back to basics and studying the notion of equilibrium for two coupled general - covariant systems .",
    "coupling generally - covariant systems is subtle , as we show below .",
    "we study how two generally covariant system can couple in section [ cl ] , after a brief review of the hamiltonian description of general covariant systems @xcite ; this opens a wealth of interesting questions .",
    "once these have been clarified , we study equilibrium in the context of this coupling in section [ see ] , using the idea of thermal time .",
    "we obtain two surprising results .",
    "the first is that we recover directly the characterization of equilibrium as vanishing information flow introduced in @xcite .",
    "the second is a tantalizing relation between equilibrium and gauge , which , in our opinion , provides strong support for the interpretation of gauge in terms of the unpredictable but measurable partial observables discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we summarize our results and the ensuing general picture of coupling and equilibrium for covariant systems in section [ disc ] .",
    "we start with a condensed review of dirac s generalized hamiltonian dynamics @xcite , with an example followed by the general case translated into modern language .",
    "a general - covariant system is defined by a lagrangian that leads to a vanishing canonical hamiltonian .",
    "its equations of motion are invariant under reparametrization of the evolution parameter .",
    "the legendre transform of the lagrangian of these systems defines a phase space with constraints , and the dynamics is coded in the constraints .",
    "one view on the goal of this formalism is that it expresses dynamics in a relational language @xcite .",
    "the physical correlations among dynamical variables are defined without specifying one of these as the independent  time \" variable .    as an illustrative example consider a simple harmonic oscillator and its covariant lagrangian 1-form l dt= ( ( dq / dt)^2-q^2 ) dt= ( ^2/^2-q^2 ) d , with position @xmath2 , time @xmath3 and where dot denotes derivatives with respect to an arbitrary parameter @xmath4 .",
    "legendre transforming yields an extended phase space @xmath5 with coordinates @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and the conjugate coordinates are interpreted as momentum @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 .",
    "the symplectic form on @xmath5 is @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian vanishes identically and hence leads to the hamiltonian constraint c = e- ( q^2 + p^2 ) = e - h(p , q )",
    ".    the constraint surface can be coordinatized by @xmath11 and we find the restricted ( pre-)symplectic form @xmath12 on this surface .",
    "the flows corresponding to vectors in the kernel of the form @xmath13 are called the orbits and they capture the physical correlations between the observables . these can be coordinated by the values @xmath14 at @xmath15 , or , better , by the amplitude and phase @xmath16 that label the orbits a= ,   = ( q/)-t [ nn ] .    the equations of are the relations between partial observables predicted by the theory .",
    "they can be rewritten in the recognizable form q = a(t + ) ,   p = a ( t + ) .",
    "notice that this is a formulation of the dynamics of an oscillator where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are treated on an equal footing .",
    "the symplectic form can be further reduced to live just on the space of the orbits and a direct computation gives @xmath17 .",
    "( that is @xmath18 ) .",
    "we turn now to the general case , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the ( extended ) phase space ( cube of fig .",
    "[ uno]a ) and @xmath19 denote the subspace of @xmath5 where the constraints vanish ( surface of fig .",
    "[ uno]a ) .",
    "the symplectic space @xmath5 has a canonical symplectic form @xmath20 .",

    "each point in @xmath25 is a  motion \" , namely a physically distinct solution of the equations of motion of the system , and establishes a system of relations ( defined by its orbit ) among the partial observables @xcite , which are functions on @xmath5 ( restricted to @xmath19 ) .",
    "these relations are the predictions of the theory .",
    "this formulation is a generalization of conventional mechanics because it remains valid also for systems ( like the relativistic ones ) , where @xmath29 does not have the form @xmath30 .",
    "two non - relativistic systems @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with phase spaces @xmath33 and @xmath34 and hamiltonians @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be given a unified description in terms of the coupled phase space @xmath37 , with hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "this kinematical coupling allows the possibility of a dynamical coupling between the systems , for instance by adding to @xmath0 a term , @xmath39 , that does not factorize into the sum of two functions , one on @xmath33 and one on @xmath34 .",
    "can the same be done for general - covariant systems ?",
    "consider two general covariant systems @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with ( extended ) phase spaces @xmath40 and @xmath41 whose dynamics are determined by the hamiltonian constraints @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "how do we couple them ?",
    "the obvious way is to consider the ( extended ) phase space @xmath44 , with symplectic form @xmath45 and the constraint system c_1=0 ,  c_2=0 .",
    "[ cs ] this is simple and , we argue , correct , but subtle ; to see this , consider an example .",
    "let @xmath40 admit canonical coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is the general - covariant form of a system with one degree of freedom and hamiltonian @xmath48 .",
    "say this is the covariant description of a pendulum . similarly for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the surface where the constraints are satisfied admits coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "the constraint orbits are two - dimensional , and @xmath52 can be taken as parameters along each orbit . the physical phase space ( the space of the orbits )",
    "can be coordinatized by the values of @xmath53 at @xmath54 ; this is fine .",
    "but the dynamics is now curiously characterized by _ two _ times . what is the interpretation of this fact ?",
    "a dynamical system is interpreted when we give a physical interpretation to its partial observables @xcite .",
    "the motion of the system is then described by the correlations between these partial observables . in our example",
    ", @xmath55 represents an event where the first pendulum is in a certain position @xmath56 of space at a certain value @xmath57 of time , measured with the clock @xmath57 , and the same for @xmath58 and the other pendulum .",
    "once we fix a point in the physical phase space , that is a state of motion or a solution of the equations of motion , the theory gives us the position of the first pendulum at any @xmath57 and , independently , the position of the second at any @xmath59 , for any arbitrary choice of @xmath57 _ and _ @xmath59 .",
    "this is the simple physical interpretation of the double time parameter .",
    "correspondingly , each orbit in the constraint surface is two - dimensional .",
    "but , of course , we may not be interested in this .",
    "we may be interested uniquely in the position of the two oscillators at the same time [ syncro ] t = t_1=t_2 .",
    "for instance , we may assume that we are describing a setting in which our partial observables are only three : the two positions and a single clock .",
    "then we only look at the position of both particles at a single clock time .",
    "the theory provides this information , of course .",
    "if we want to restrict ourselves to _ this _ information , then we can pose equation as a gauge fixing condition , which selects a one - dimensional trajectory within each two - dimensional orbit .",
    "the gauge fixing splits the two - dimensional first - class constraint system into two parts : the single constraint c = c_1+c_2=0 that commutes with the gauge - fixing condition = t_2-t_1=0 [ gf ] and the constraint = c_1-c_2 that becomes second - class in conjunction with the gauge - fixing condition . with this",
    ", we can clearly interpret the constraint @xmath29 as the overall hamiltonian constraint that generates time evolution , and @xmath60 as a gauge .",
    "thus , the relation between the coupled systems and a system with a single time variable is obtained by interpreting one combination of constraints as gauge , and the other as the hamiltonian constraint . in turn , this is equivalent to a selection of the partial observables , which represent the quantities to which we assume we have access .",
    "the identification of @xmath57 and @xmath59 is not always necessary or convenient .",
    "for instance , in a general - covariant field theory like general relativity we have one hamiltonian constraint per point of space , and a multi - fingered time evolution . in a sense",
    ", we can view the system as a coupling of one general - covariant system per each space point . a gauge fixing analogous to amounts then to reducing the multi - fingered time to a single global time .",
    "this can be convenient is some special situations where a global notion of time is easy to construct , but has no physical significance in general .",
    "therefore in general the dynamics of the coupled system @xmath61 is generally described by two _ independent _ times .",
    "the choice of the partial observables in terms of which we want to describe the system is a matter of convenience , or additional physical inputs .",
    "a simple example of a physical input that can give rise to the gauge fixing just considered is an interaction @xmath39 that affects the systems at times @xmath57 and @xmath59 only when @xmath62 . in what follows",
    ", we will see that a related additional physical input , which can select a particular combination of  times \" on physical grounds , is provided by specifying an equilibrium state of the coupled system .",
    "to do so , we need to move from mechanics to statistical mechanics .",
    "a statistical state @xmath63 is a ( normalized ) smooth positive function on the phase space , which defines a statistical distribution in the sense of gibbs @xcite . in a conventional non - relativistic theory , where a hamiltonian @xmath0 is given ,",
    "the states of the form @xmath64 are the equilibrium thermal states , or gibbs states .",
    "they are stationary and describe thermalized systems coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "notice that ( up to an overall multiplicative factor ) the information on the time flow is coded into the gibbs states as well as in the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , a gibbs state @xmath63 is dual to the time flow @xmath65 in the sense that ( x_t ) = d , where @xmath20 is the symplectic form .",
    "this is a key equation .",
    "thus , the time flow @xmath66 can be recovered from the gibbs state @xmath63 ( up to the constant factor @xmath67 , discussed below in sec .",
    "[ eqstate ] ) .",
    "this fact suggests that in a thermal context it may be possible to ascribe the dynamical properties of the system to the thermal state , rather than to the hamiltonian : the gibbs state determines a flow , and this flow is precisely the time flow .",
    "this idea , discussed in detail in @xcite is the thermal - time hypothesis .",
    "and then @xmath8 , and measuring @xmath8 and then @xmath2 @xcite . ]    let us now come back to the general - covariant theory recalled in the previous section . here one can define a statistical state @xmath63 as a positive function @xmath68 , normalized with respect to the liouville measure @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "any ( non - degenerate ) statistical state defines a vector field @xmath71 by ( x_)= d , [ fflow ] where @xmath26 is the symplectic form on @xmath25 .",
    "the field @xmath71 generates a flow @xmath72 on @xmath25 called the _ thermal flow _ ; its generator h= -[mod ] is called the thermal hamiltonian .",

    "this thermal flow determines a time flow , i.e. a vector field @xmath74 on the constraint surface through the requirement [ flow ] _ * x_=x_. solutions of the condition have a natural ambiguity due to the definition of the projection @xmath28 : any of the vectors tangent to the orbits , the @xmath22 of sec .",

    "it follows immediately from that _ * ( _ t)=- _ [ pii ] because _ * ( _ t)= _ a+ _ = -_. on the other hand , the kernel of the pre - symplectic form @xmath79 is y=_t+ _ p- _ q=_t+q_p - p_q . [ y ] so the general solution of ( [ flow ] ) is increases in the counter - clockwise direction . ]",
    "x_= -_t + y. these relations are illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ uno ] . the thermal flow ( lower arrow ) in the physical phase space determines a flow from orbit to orbit in the constraint surface .",
    "what to make of the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath74 ? as discussed in sec .",
    "[ cl ] , the orbits contained in the constraint surface code physical correlations between the partial observables of the system . however , these correlations are given in an unparametrized manner . in the case of a one - dimensional orbit",
    "all of the points of the curve @xmath80 are given as a set .",
    "the vector @xmath81 is always tangent to this orbit but does not lead to a parametrization because @xmath82 .",
    "this shows that while the orbits capture all the physical correlations they do not encode dynamics .    to understand the relation between this picture and the conventional description of time evolution , notice that the two solutions of the equation of motion q = a(t + ) , and q = a(t + ( + ) ) , differ _ only _ in the fact that one is shifted in time with respect to the other .",
    "this shows that a shift in time can be represented as a shift in the space of the solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "dynamics is a motion from orbit to orbit .",
    "it is precisely this latter motion that is captured by the thermal flow @xmath83 and the physical symplectic form @xmath26 .",
    "remarkably , the time flow @xmath74 and the pre - symplectic form @xmath13 capture the same relations :     ( _ ) & = ^ * ( _ ) = ( _ * _ ) = ( _ * x _ ) + & = ( x _ ) .",
    "thus the ambiguity in the determination of @xmath74 has no impact on the dynamics generated by this vector field .",
    "this completes the covariant treatment . in special cases",
    "it is also possible to identify the partial observable @xmath3 acting as time .",
    "this is achieved by making a split of all the partial observables into one , call it @xmath3 , and the rest and then finding an @xmath74 such that i _",
    "* x_= x_t|_c , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denotes the restriction of this vector field to the constraint surface ; as always , @xmath86 means the vector field where @xmath3 is changed while the other partial observables coordinatizing @xmath5 are held fixed .",
    "this procedure relies on a nice choice of partial observables from the outset and may be difficult to carry out in general , however it clarifies the recovery of the usual formulation in simple examples such as the oscillator discussed here .",
    "the relationships are summarized by x_t|_c x _ x_. [ time ]    in conclusion , the general - covariant description of the dynamics of a system treats the time variables exactly on the same ground as the other variables .",
    "but the selection of a state distinguishes a flow , the thermal flow .",
    "in particular , a gibbs state @xmath87 singles out the variable @xmath3 ( possibly scaled by @xmath67 ) as the thermal time .",
    "we can now use these tools in the context of coupled covariant systems .      consider two systems @xmath31 and @xmath32 with ( extended ) phase space @xmath88 , and constraints @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",

    "the thermal hamiltonian of the coupled system is a sum of two terms , each one defining a flow in its own physical phase space , but notice that the statistical state @xmath63 defines a _ common _ flow , with a single time for the two systems .",
    "this fixes a preferred split of the system of constraints into a single global hamiltonian constraint and a gauge .",

    "imagine that the two harmonic oscillators of the example are placed at different levels in a static gravitational field and exchange heat with a common thermal bath ( a warm gas , or radiation field , in which they are immersed ) .",
