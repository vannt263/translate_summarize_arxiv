    "in this paper , we relate the three geometries of constant curvature by constructing a continuous transition between them .",

    "precise will consist in showing that segments , angles , figures and several properties and propositions of the two non - euclidean geometries converge in some appropriate sense to those of the euclidean one .",
    "we say that the geometries _",

    "the group - theoretic definitions of each of the primary notions of the geometries of constant curvature ( points , lines , etc . )",
    "make them transit in a coherent way .",
    "the idea of transition of geometries was already emitted by klein in  15 of his paper @xcite ( see also the comments in @xcite ) .",
    "we note however that the abstract theoretical setting of transformation groups was not really developed at the time klein wrote the paper @xcite .",
    "the notion of  classical group \" , which is probably the most convenient setting for the description of these groups , was developed later , in works of weyl @xcite , dieudonn @xcite and others .",
    "the construction we describe here is also developed in chapter 9 of our _ notes on hyperbolic geometry _ @xcite .",
    "we review the basic ideas and we add to them some new results and comments . beyond the fact that it establishes relations between the three classical geometries ,",
    "this theory highlights at the same time the important notions of _ families _ and of _",
    "we work in a fiber space over @xmath7 $ ] where the fibers above each point are built out of the groups of transformations of the three geometries .",
    "each fiber is a geometry of constant curvature considered as a homogeneous space in the sense of lie group theory , that is , a space of cosets @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a lie group  the orthogonal group of some quadratic form  and @xmath10 the stabilizer of a point .",
    "this is an example of the classical concept of _ klein geometry _ , see e.g. @xcite in this volume .",
    "when the parameter @xmath1 $ ] is negative , the homogeneous space is the hyperbolic plane of a certain constant negative curvature .",
    "when it is positive , the homogeneous space is the sphere ( or the elliptic plane ) of a certain constant positive curvature .",
    "when the parameter is zero , the homogeneous space is the euclidean plane .",
    "we can define points , lines and other notions in the geometry using the underlying group .",
    "for instance , a _ point _ will be a maximal abelian compact subgroup of @xmath9 ( which can be thought of as the stabilizer group of the point in the ambient group ) .",
    "the _ space _ of the geometry is the set of points , and it is thus built out of the group .",
    "line _ is a maximal set of maximal abelian compact subgroups having the property that the subgroup generated by any two elements in this set is abelian .",
    "other basic elements of the geometry ( angle , etc . ) can be defined in a similar fashion .",
    "this is in the spirit of klein s erlangen program where a geometry consists of a group action . in this case , the underlying space of the geometry is even constructed from the abstract group .",
    "the definitions are made in such a way that points , distances , angles , geometrical figures and trigonometric formulae vary continuously from hyperbolic to spherical geometry , transiting through the euclidean , and several phenomena can be explained in a coherent manner .    to be more precise , we consider the vector space @xmath11 equipped with a basis , and we denote the coordinates of a point @xmath12 by @xmath13 or more simply @xmath14 .",
    "we recall that the isometry groups of the hyperbolic plane and of the sphere are respectively the orthogonal groups of the quadratic form @xmath15 and @xmath16 introducing a nonzero real parameter @xmath4 does not make a difference at the level of the axioms of the geometries ( although it affects the curvature ) : for any @xmath3 ( respectively @xmath2 ) the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane ( respectively the sphere ) is isomorphic to the orthogonal group of the quadratic form @xmath17    we wish to include the euclidean plane in this picture .",
    "the first guess to reach the euclidean plane is to give the parameter @xmath4 the value 0 .",
    "this does not lead to the desired result .",
    "in fact , although the orthogonal groups of the quadratic forms @xmath18 , for @xmath2 ( respectively for @xmath3 ) are all isomorphic , they are not uniformly bounded in terms of @xmath4 , and when @xmath19 , their dimension blows up . indeed , when @xmath19 from either side , the quadratic form @xmath18 reduces to @xmath20 whose orthogonal group is much larger than the isometry group of the euclidean plane .",
    "thus , an adjustment is needed . for this , we shall introduce the notion of  coherent element \" .",
    "this will make the euclidean plane automorphism group ( and the euclidean plane itself ) appear in a continuous way between the hyperbolic and spherical automorphism group ( respectively the hyperbolic plane and the sphere ) .",
    "we now define the fiber space @xmath6 , equipped with its fibration @xmath21.\\ ] ] the fiber @xmath22 above each @xmath1 $ ] will be a space of constant positive curvature @xmath23 for @xmath2 and of constant negative curvature @xmath24 for @xmath3 , such that when @xmath4 converges to @xmath5 from either side , @xmath22 converges to the euclidean plane .",

    "finally , let @xmath29 be defined by taking fiberwise the connected component of the identity element in the orthogonal group of the quadratic form @xmath18 , for each @xmath1 $ ] .    in other words , for every @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31 is the orientation - preserving component of the orthogonal group of the quadratic form @xmath18 .",
    "it is a lie group of dimension 3 . however , as we already noticed , @xmath32 is a lie group of dimension 6 .",
    "it is the matrix group @xmath33 this is the group of matrices of the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the fact that the determinant is positive is a consequence of the orientation - preserving assumption .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is the usual matrix representation group of the orientation - preserving group of affine transformations of @xmath36 .",
    "equivalently , it is the group of matrices preserving the @xmath37-plane in @xmath11 .",
    "( one can deduce this fom the fact that the affine group is the subgroup of the group of projective transformations that preserve a hyperplane in projective space . )",
    "this shows again that @xmath32 is not isomorphic to the group of orientation - preserving euclidean motions of the plane .",
    "we shall reduce the size of @xmath32 , by restricting the type of matrices that we consider .",
    "an element @xmath25 of @xmath32 is said to be _ coherent _ if for all @xmath38 and @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 , there exists an analytic function @xmath41 such that for each @xmath1 $ ] the matrix @xmath42 belongs to @xmath31 , and @xmath43 .",

    "we now study @xmath47 .    the coherent elements of @xmath32 form a group and they have important features .",
    "we start with the following :    if @xmath48 is coherent , then @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath30 , we have @xmath49 since @xmath25 is an orthogonal matrix of a non - degenerate quadratic form .",
    "the result then follows from the definition of coherence and from the fact that the map @xmath50 is continuous .",
    "we also have the following :    [ pro : coh ] an element @xmath48 is coherent if and only if @xmath25 is an orientation - preserving motion of the euclidean plane .",
    "let @xmath48 be a coherent element . from the definition , we have @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the 9 sequences @xmath54 , for @xmath40 , converge and therefore they are bounded . for @xmath30 , since @xmath55 preserves the quadratic form @xmath18 , therefore it also preserves the form @xmath56 . for @xmath57 , let @xmath58 denote the @xmath38-th column of @xmath55 . we show that for @xmath59 , the @xmath56-scalar product of @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th coefficient of the kronecker delta function .",
    "we have @xmath62 @xmath63    since @xmath55 preserve @xmath56 , we get @xmath64 for all @xmath30 . since the sequences @xmath65 converge , we obtain @xmath66 , therefore the coherence property imposes @xmath67 .",
    "now we use the fact that the section @xmath68 is differentiable ( recall that by coherence , it is even analytic ) .",
    "this gives @xmath69 , therefore @xmath70 , which implies @xmath71 .",
    "we get @xmath72 .    in the same way",
    ", we prove that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it follows that the first principal 2-bloc of @xmath25 is an orthogonal matrix , which implies that @xmath47 is a direct isometry group of the euclidean plane . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath75 matrix @xmath76 preserves the standard quadratic form on @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it is an element of the euclidean rotation group @xmath77 .    _",
    "note. _ in the proof of the preceding proposition , we used the fact that the coherence property imposes that the sections @xmath78 are differentiable .",
    "there is another proof in @xcite ( proposition 2.2 ) which only uses the existence of sections that are only continuous .",
    "the set of coherent elements of @xmath32 , being the group of orientation - preserving motions of the euclidean plane , is the group we are looking for .    from now",
    "on , we use the notation @xmath32 for the subgroup of _ coherent _ elements instead of the previously defined group @xmath32 .",
    "thus , in the following , for each @xmath1 $ ] , any element of @xmath31 is coherent .",
    "the space of coherent elements ( for variable @xmath4 ) is not a locally trivial fiber bundle ( for instance , the topological type of the fiber @xmath31 is not constant ; it is compact for @xmath2 and noncompact for @xmath3 ) .",
    "however this space has nice properties which follow from the fact that it has many continuous ( and even analytic ) sections .",
    "for every @xmath1 $ ] , we define @xmath22 as the set of maximal abelian compact subgroups of @xmath31 .",
    "an element of @xmath22 is a _ point _ of our geometry .",

    "a coherent family of points in the fiber space @xmath79 is a coherent family of maximal abelian compact subgroups of @xmath31 .",
    "this is a family depending analytically on the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we can also consider coherent families of pairs ( respectively triples , etc . ) of points .",
    "this defines the segments ( respectively triangles , etc . ) of our geometries .",
    "we can study the corresponding distance ( respectively area , etc . )",
    "function of @xmath4 defined by such a pair or triple , in algebraic terms .    for each @xmath80",
    ", we denote by @xmath81 the maximal subgroup that defines @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath82 is a group isomorphic to the circle group @xmath77 , for each @xmath80 , there exists a unique order - two element @xmath83 .",
    "we shall make use of this element . in the circle group @xmath77",
    ", this corresponds to the rotation of angle @xmath84 .",
    "we call @xmath85 the _ reflection _ , or _ involution _ in @xmath31 , of center @xmath12 . in this way ,",

    "let us consider in more detail the case @xmath2 .",
    "this case is particularly interesting , because we can formulate the elements of spherical polarity theory in this setting .",

    "more concretely , @xmath103 is a rotation along the line in 3-space which is perpendicular to the plane of the great circle determined by @xmath12 and @xmath99 .",
    "this line passes through the pole @xmath104 of the great circle , and therefore the product @xmath103 commutes with the pole @xmath104 ( seen as an involution ) .",
    "given @xmath80 , the equator of @xmath12 is the set of all @xmath105 whose image under the stabilizer of @xmath12 in @xmath31 is a straight line",
    ".    in spherical ( or elliptic ) geometry , a symmetry with respect to a point is also a symmetry with respect to a line .",
    "this can be seen using the above description of points as involutions .",
    "from the definition , the involution corresponding to the pole of a line fixes the pole , but it also fixes pointwise the equator . the pole can be characterized in this setting as being the unique _ isolated _ fixed point of its involution .",
    "the set of other fixed points is the equator .",
    "thus , to a line in elliptic geometry is naturally associated an involution .",
    "we can use polarity to define perpendicularity between lines : consider two lines @xmath106 and @xmath107 that intersect at a point @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath108 and @xmath107 are _ perpendicular _ if the pole of @xmath106 belongs to @xmath107 .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the polar dual to @xmath107 belongs to @xmath106 .",
    "this also defines the notion of _ right angle_.    in what follows , we shall measure lengths in the geometry @xmath22 for @xmath2 .",
    "we know that in spherical ( or elliptic ) geometry , there is a natural length unit .",
    "the length unit in this space can be taken to be the diameter of a line ( all lines in that geometry are homeomorphic to a circle ) , or as the diameter of the whole space ( which is compact ) .",
    "we can also use the correspondence between lines and poles and define a normalized distance on @xmath22 , by fixing once and for all the distance from a point to its equator .",
    "we normalize this distance by setting it equal to @xmath109 .",

    "the family @xmath112 , @xmath1 $ ] is a coherent family of points .",
    "this group - theoretic definition of points allows the continuous transition of points in the space @xmath6 .",
    "likewise , the group - theoretic definition of lines makes this notion coherent transit from one geometry to another .",
    "now we introduce the notion of angle .",
    "we want a notion that transits between the various geometries .",
    "this can also be done group - theoretically in a coherent manner .",
    "there are various ways of doing it , and one way is the following .",
    "we start with the group - theoretic description of a point as a maximal compact abelian subgroup ( the  stabilizer \" of the point ) . such a subgroup is isomorphic to a circle group . but the circle group is also the set of all oriented lines starting at the given point .",
    "it is equipped with its natural haar measure , which we normalize so that the total measure of the circle is @xmath114 .",
    "this gives a measure on the set of oriented lines .",
    "from these measures , we obtain the notion of angle at every point .",
    "it is also possible to give a coherent definition of an angle by using a formula , and we shall do this in  [ s : angle ] .",
    "now we consider transition of distances .",
    "to measure distances between points , we use a model for the space @xmath22 for each @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "we take the unit sphere @xmath116 , that is , the space of vectors in @xmath11 of norm one with respect to the quadratic form @xmath18 .",

    "now we define distances between pairs of points in each @xmath22 and then we study transition of distances .    for @xmath123 , we use the angular distance in @xmath22 . to do so , for each @xmath30 , we let @xmath124 be the bilinear form associated to the quadratic form @xmath18 , that is , @xmath125 we set , for every @xmath126 and @xmath127 in @xmath22 , @xmath128 we call @xmath129 the _ angular distance _ between the points @xmath126 and @xmath127 . for each @xmath30 , the angular distance can be thought of as being defined on @xmath119 , but also on the 2-dimensional projective plane , the quotient of @xmath130 by the nonzero homotheties . as a distance on the space @xmath22",

    "we start with @xmath2 .",
    "we compute the limit as @xmath140 , of the distance from @xmath112 to @xmath152 in @xmath22 , normalized by dividing it by @xmath153 .",
    "we have @xmath154 @xmath155 and @xmath156    we use the angular distance from @xmath112 to @xmath152 , measured with @xmath18 , @xmath2 . by equation ( [ eq : dis ] ) , we have @xmath157 taking @xmath158 as a factor for distances in @xmath22 , the distance @xmath133 between the two points becomes    @xmath159    the limit as @xmath19 , @xmath2 , of @xmath160 is @xmath161 , which is what the distance from @xmath143 to @xmath162 in @xmath47 ought to be .",
    "thus , we define the distance @xmath163 on each @xmath22 to be the angular distance @xmath131 given in ( [ eq : dis ] ) divided by @xmath153 . in this way , the distance function transits .",
    "the fact that points and distances transit between the various geometries implies that triangles also transit .",
    "we already noted that angles also transit . from this , we get several properties .",
    "for instance , since angle bisectors may be defined using equidistance , the following property transits between the various geometries :    the angle bisectors in a triangle intersect at a common point .",
    "the reader can search for other properties that transit between the various geometries .",
    "curvature is also a coherent notion .",
    "indeed , curvature in spherical and in hyperbolic geometry is defined as the integral of the excess ( respectively the defect ) to two right angles of the angle sum in a triangle ( and to a multiple of a right angle for more general polygons ) .",
    "this notion transits through euclidean geometry , which is characterized by zero excess to two right angles .",
    "one can make this more precise , by choosing a triangle with fixed side lengths  for instance with three sides equal to a quarter of a circle  and making this triangle transit through the geometries .",
    "the trigonometric formulae , in a geometry , make relations between lengths and angles in triangles .",
    "they are at the bases of the geometry , since from these formulae , one can recover the geometric properties of the space .",
    "let us recall the formal similarities between the trigonometric formulae in hyperbolic and in spherical geometry .",
    "one example is the famous  sine rule \" , which is stated as follows :    for any triangle @xmath164 , with sides ( or side lengths ) @xmath165 opposite to the vertices @xmath166 , we have , in euclidean geometry : @xmath167 in spherical geometry : @xmath168 and in hyperbolic geometry : @xmath169    thus , to pass from the euclidean to the spherical ( respectively the hyperbolic ) , one replaces a side length by the cosine of the side length ( respectively the sine of the length ) .",
    "since using the sine rule one can prove many other trigonometric formulae , it is natural to expect that there are many occurrences of trigonometric formulae in non - euclidean geometry where one replaces the circular functions of the side lengths ( sin , cos , etc . ) by the hyperbolic function of these side lengths , in order to get the hyperbolic geometry formulae from the spherical ones .",
    "examples are contained in the following table .",
    "they concern a triangle @xmath164 having a right angle at @xmath170 :    [ table1 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this table , the euclidean formulae in the middle column are obtained by taking taylor series expansions of any of the two corresponding non - euclidean ones , for side lengths tending to @xmath5 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the spherical and the hyperbolic geometries become euclidean at the level of infinitesimal triangles .",
    "the transitional geometry sheds a new light on the analogies between the trigonometric formulae .",
    "fisrt , we must recall that the above formulae are valid for spaces of constant curvatures @xmath171 , @xmath5 and @xmath172 . in a geometry",
    "@xmath22 , with @xmath30 , one has to introduce a parameter @xmath4 in the above trigonometric formulae . for instance , for a right triangle @xmath164 with right angle at @xmath170 , we have , in spherical geometry ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath173 and in hyperbolic geometry ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath174    now we can study the transition of this formula , called the _",
    "pythagorean theorem_.    we first study the transition of a triangle",
    ".    for @xmath1 $ ] , let @xmath145 and consider the coherent family of points @xmath146 $ ] represented by the vector @xmath147 . take a real number @xmath175 .",
    "for any @xmath115 $ ] , let @xmath149 and @xmath176 be the two coherent families of points represented by the stabilizers in @xmath31 of the vectors @xmath150 and @xmath177 of @xmath11 .",
    "the family @xmath178 , @xmath115 $ ] is a coherent family of triangles .",
    "the triangle @xmath179 is a right triangle at @xmath25 , with catheti ratio @xmath180 . to see that each triangle @xmath181 is right",
    ", we note that if we change @xmath138 into @xmath182 , we do not change the angle value .",
    "( recall the definition of the angle measure as the haar measure on @xmath77 . )",
    "therefore there is a transformation of the space @xmath22 that belongs to our isometry group and that sends this angle to its opposite .",
    "therefore the angle is equal to its symmetric image , and therefore it is right .",
    "we saw ( proof of proposition 2.1 ) that in the geometry @xmath22 , the distance between the two points @xmath112 and @xmath152 is given by @xmath183 likewise , the distance between the two points @xmath112 and @xmath184 is equal to @xmath185    in the geometry @xmath47 , the distance from from @xmath143 to @xmath186 is equal to @xmath187 .",
    "we need to know the distance in @xmath47 between the points @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the angular distance from @xmath152 to @xmath184 , measured with @xmath18 , @xmath2 , is @xmath190    up to higher order terms , this expression is equal to    @xmath191    we collect the information in the following lemma , using the fact that in the coherent geometry @xmath47 , distances are obtained as a limit of normalized distances in @xmath22 for @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) .    in the geometry",
    "@xmath22 , we have @xmath192 @xmath193 and @xmath194 in the coherent geometry @xmath47 , we have @xmath195 @xmath196 and @xmath197    using this lemma , we now show that the euclidean pythagorean formula in @xmath47 is a limit of the pythagorean formula in @xmath22 for @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath175 and @xmath134 be real numbers and let @xmath2 . in the triangle @xmath181 , the lengths of the three sides ( measured in @xmath22 ) are the angular distances @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 . the first natural attempt is to write the pythagorean theorem in spherical geometry , for the triangle with right angle at @xmath112 : @xmath201    taking the limit , as @xmath19 gives @xmath202 which is correct but which is not the euclidean pythagorean theorem . we obtain a more useful result by taking another limit .",
    "we transform the spherical pythagorean theorem into the following one : @xmath203 @xmath204 writing this equation at the first order using the expansion @xmath205 and taking the limit as @xmath19 , with @xmath2 ( use equation [ 11 ] ) gives @xmath206 which is the pythagorean theorem in the geometry @xmath47 . this is indeed the familiar pythagorean theorem in euclidean geometry .",
    "it is possible to do the same calculation in the hyperbolic case ( @xmath3 ) , where the hyperbolic pythagorean theorem is :    @xmath207",
    "using the pythagorean theorem in spherical and hyperbolic geometry , it is possible to prove the other formulae in the above table , in particular the formulae @xmath208 in spherical geometry and @xmath209 in hyperbolic geometry .    at the same time , we can study convergence of angles .",
    "for this take a triangle @xmath164 with right angle at @xmath170 and let @xmath210 be the angle at @xmath25 . for each @xmath4 ,",
    "the ( lengths of the ) sides opposite to @xmath166 are respectively @xmath211 in the geometry @xmath22 .",
    "take the side lengths @xmath147 and @xmath212 to be constant , @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "for each @xmath4 , we have , in the geometry @xmath22 , @xmath215 as @xmath19 , we have @xmath216 .",
    "thus , the angle @xmath217 in the triangle @xmath218 converges indeed to the euclidean angle .",
    "there are several works dealing with non - euclidean area .",
    "for instance , in the paper @xcite , euler obtained the following formula for the area @xmath219 of a spherical triangle of side lengths @xmath165 : @xmath220 this formula should be compared to the heron formula in euclidean geometry that gives the area @xmath219 of a triangle in terms of its side length . in the geometry",
    "@xmath22 ( @xmath2 ) , euler s formula becomes @xmath221 setting @xmath222 to simplify notation , we write this formula as @xmath223 we would like to see that euler s formula ( [ euler1 ] ) transits and leads to the area formula in euclidean geometry for @xmath90",
    ". it suffices to deal with right triangles , and we therefore assume that the angle at @xmath224 is right .",
    "we use the pythagorean theorem @xmath225      using the formula for the cosine of the double and taking the square , we obtain the formula @xmath226 the degree-8 taylor expansion of @xmath227 is @xmath228 the first term in this expansion is @xmath229 , that is , @xmath230 , which is the square of the expression @xmath231 . recall now that for the transition of the distance function (  [ s : trans ] ) , we had to normalize the length function in @xmath22 , dividing it by @xmath153 .",
    "it is natural then , for the transition of the area function , to divide it by @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the result that we obtain is @xmath232 , which is indeed the area of a euclidean triangle with base @xmath147 and altitude @xmath212 .",
    "finally , we note that there has been a recent activity on transition of geometries in dimension @xmath97 , namely , on moving continuously between the eight thurston geometries , and also on varying continuously between riemannian and lorentzian geometries on orbifolds .",
    "we mention the works of porti @xcite , @xcite and porti and weiss @xcite and cooper , hodgson and kerckhoff @xcite , kerckhoff and storm @xcite and dancieger @xcite .",
    "the ideas and the methods are different from those of the present paper .",
    "this is in accordance with a well - established tradition to trying to extend to teh complex world .",
    "we recall in this respect the following words of painlev @xcite  entre deux vrits du domaine rel , le chemin le plus facile et le plus court passe bien souvent par le domaine complexe . \"",
    "( between two truths of the real domain , the easiest and shortest path quite often passes through the complex domain . )",
