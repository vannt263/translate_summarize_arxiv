    "the systematic measurement of the static properties of hadrons has led to a better understanding of their fundamental structure . however , their finite size  a consequence of the confinement of quarks inside a spatial volume  has not been thoroughly explored .",
    "sizes of hadrons may be probed by their strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "most commonly the electromagnetic charge radius is measured in elastic electron - hadron scattering . for unstable hadrons",
    "the inverse kinematics can be applied using a suitable hadronic beam .",
    "so far , electromagnetic radii have been established only for the proton @xcite , neutron @xcite ,   @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the pion and the kaon radius indicates a dependence on the strangeness content . a systematic study of the radii of hyperons with different strangeness will therefore enhance our understanding of the relative sizes of hadrons as bound quark systems .",
    "theoretical predictions for the  charge radius have been divergent  @xcite .",
    "the most recent efforts suggest @xmath1  @xcite on the one hand and @xmath2  @xcite on the other . the feasibility of probing the  radius by inverse electron scattering has been demonstrated at cern  @xcite .",
    "we present here the first high - statistics measurement of the charge radius .",
    "the primary objective of selex is the study of charm hadroproduction and spectroscopy of charm baryons in the forward hemisphere .",
    "the experiment was built as a 3-stage magnetic spectrometer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : selex ] .",
    "here we only describe those features of the apparatus which are relevant to hadron - electron scattering .",
    "the 800  proton beam from the fermilab tevatron was steered onto a be target to produce a beam consisting of equal numbers of  and  at 610  mean momentum .",
    "the hyperon beam had a momentum spread of @xmath3 .",
    "other constituents were 1  %  and less than 0.1  % other particles .",
    "the magnet polarity could be reversed to provide a 540  beam containing 94  % protons and 3  % each of  and .",
    "a transition radiation detector ( btrd ) separated the baryonic from the mesonic beam components .",
    "interactions took place in a target stack of two cu and three c foils adding up to 4.2  % of an interaction length for protons .",
    "the first two magnets ( m1 , m2 ) implemented momentum cuts of 2.5  and 15  , respectively .",
    "downstream of the second magnet a second transition radiation detector ( etrd ) identified scattered electrons .",
    "each stage of the spectrometer was equipped with a lead glass calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "tracking information was provided by a combination of silicon microstrip detectors , proportional chambers ( pwc ) , and drift chambers ( dc ) .",
    "candidates for elastic scattering events were selected by a scintillator - based trigger requiring two charged particles in the m2 spectrometer both of which originated in the target area .",
    "the total multiplicity signal directly downstream of the targets was combined with the charge and multiplicity information from the hodoscope after magnet m2 .",
    "the total charge was required to correspond to one beam particle plus one electron .",
    "an online filter refined this selection by checking for the same topology using particle tracks reconstructed in the m2 spectrometer .",
    "the differential cross section of the elastic scattering of a spin 1/2 baryon ( mass @xmath4 ) off an electron ( mass @xmath5 ) can be approximated by the relation ( @xmath6)@xcite @xmath7 up to corrections of the order @xmath8 .",
    "here , @xmath9 denotes the center of mass energy and @xmath10 the four momentum transfer from the hadron to the electron .",
    "2 has a kinematically allowed maximum value which depends on the beam momentum . for instance",
    ", @xmath11 is 0.2  2c2  for 610  . for @xmath12",
    "the squared form factor can be written as a combination of the electric and magnetic form factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the beam energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "these form factors are normalized to the charge @xmath17 and the magnetic moment @xmath18 of the baryon .",
    "the mean squared charge radius is defined by the relation @xmath19 at low momentum transfers @xmath20 , both electric and magnetic form factors of the can be parameterized by the dipole approximation : @xmath21 a fit of equation  ( [ xsecmott ] ) to the shape of the measured 2distribution provides the information on  by means of equation  ( [ dipole ] ) .",
    "out of 77 million triggers with a  a sample of 5010 -electron scattering events was extracted as follows : the events containing one electron were selected and the particle trajectories combined to check if they formed vertices inside the target material . the event was accepted if it contained exactly three tracks forming one vertex consisting of the beam track , the electron candidate , and the scattered hadron candidate .    at a given beam energy , momenta and scattering angles of the outgoing electron and hadron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kinvar ] ) provide four observables to determine the four - momentum transfer from hadron to electron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dipol_final]a ) .",
    "as the measurement is overdetermined , the electron momentum could be ignored , thus avoiding sizable radiative corrections .",
    "this is an important advantage of the reversed method since in experiments with an electron beam the corrections for bremsstrahlung have a direct influence on the result .",
    "the remaining radiative corrections to the 2 spectrum due to initial bremsstrahlung loss are small , and show a variation of less than 0.2% in the 2  region used in this analysis .",
    "the momentum transfer was fitted to the remaining three observables . in the last stage of the event selection ,",
    "both scattering angles and the momentum loss of the hadron were required to satisfy the constraints imposed by elastic kinematics .",
    "a full geant  @xcite simulation of detector , trigger , reconstruction , and analysis was performed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kinvar ] ) , which yielded the correction for acceptance effects of the experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dipol_final]b ) . at @xmath22",
    "the electron is driven out of the geometric acceptance as a result of the m2 magnetic field . for @xmath23",
    "the electron is likely to hit the central sections of the hodoscopes together with the hadron , not producing a trigger . in the remaining 2 range",
    "the acceptance has only minor variations reflecting the individual efficiencies of hodoscope segments .    to eliminate kinematic effects from varying beam energy ,",
    "the measured differential cross section was weighted with the mott scattering cross section , accounting for the magnetic moment of the hadron .",
    "this yields the squared dipole form factor @xmath24 which in turn provides ( eqn .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) ; fig .",
    "[ fig : dipol_final]c ) .",
    "this method is more sensitive to  than an unbinned maximum likelihood fit of the 2  distribution even though it adds binning effects to the systematic uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the fit of @xmath24 was restricted to the 2  region of minimal systematic error between 0.035  2c2 and 0.105  2c2 .",
    "the systematic errors in  introduced by cuts on kinematic variables ( @xmath25 of the vertex fit , sum of momenta , scattering angles of electron and hadron ) were estimated by varying one cut at a time by @xmath26 of its resolution .",
    "systematic dependence of the result on the fit boundaries was studied over the full 2 range .",
    "the boundaries were selected so as to minimize this dependence , and the remaining contribution to the systematic error determined by varying them by @xmath26 of the 2 resolution .",
    "the contribution of histogram binning effects was evaluated by systematically changing the bin width .",
    "our result for the  is at this point the best direct measurement of the charge radius of a charged baryon other than the proton .",
    "it covers an unprecedented range of squared momentum transfer 2 between  and electron . with this experiment",
    "we have proven that it is possible to measure baryon charge radii in inverse kinematics with high precision . due to the @xmath28 behavior of the differential cross section the accuracy of the final result",
    "is limited by the low statistics towards higher 2 .    in a dedicated experiment",
    "it would be possible to extend trigger and reconstruction to both lower and higher 2 , allowing for increased statistics and better control of the systematics . by using very finely segmented hodoscopes , for example , one could trigger on hadron - electron pairs of very small common angle , extending the acceptance to higher 2 . since this relaxes the requirements for hadron - electron separation one could at the same time reduce the magnetic field strength downstream of the targets to have access to lower 2 as well .    00",
