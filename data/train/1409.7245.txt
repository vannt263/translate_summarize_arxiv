    "what is more , moons may outnumber rocky planets in the stellar habitable zones @xcite and therefore could be the most abundant species of habitable worlds @xcite .",
    "a moon s sense of orbital motion ( som ) is crucial to determine its origin and orbital history .",
    "about a dozen techniques have been proposed to find an extrasolar moon @xcite , but none of them can determine an exomoon s som with current technical equipment @xcite .",
    "we here identify two means to determine an exomoon s som relative to the circumstellar orbit and with respect to the planet s direction of rotation . in our simulations",
    ", we use the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) as an example for one of several elts now being built .",
    "+    [ fig : geometry ]      for our first new method to work , the moon needs to be large enough ( and the star s photometric variability sufficiently low ) to cause a direct transit signature in the stellar light curve @xcite .",
    "depending on the moon s orbital semi - major axis around the planet ( @xmath2 ) and on the orbital alignment , some stellar transits of the planet - moon pair will then show mutual planet - moon eclipses .",
    "these events have been simulated @xcite , and a planet - planet eclipse @xcite as well as mutual events in a stellar triple system @xcite have already been found in the kepler data .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ] illustrates the difficulty in determining a moon s som . panels ( a ) and ( b ) visualize the two possible scenarios of a prograde and a retrograde som with respect to the circumstellar motion . panel ( c ) presents the four possible ingress and egress locations ( arbitrarily labelled i , ii , iii , and iv ) for a mutual planet - moon event during a stellar transit .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the projection of the three - dimensional moon orbit on the two - dimensional celestial plane .",
    "if the moon transit is directly visible in the stellar light curve , then events i and ii can be distinguished from events iii and iv , simply by determining whether the moon enters the stellar disk first and then performs a mutual event with the planet ( iii and iv ) or the planet enters the stellar disk first before a mutual event ( i and ii ) . however , this inspection can not discern event i from ii or event iii from iv .",
    "therefore , prograde and retrograde orbits can not be distinguished from each other .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ]  ( e ) illustrates how the i / ii and iii / iv ambiguities can be solved . due to the finite speed of light",
    ", there will be a time delay between events i and ii , and between events iii and iv .",
    "it will show up as a transit timing dichotomy ( ttd ) between mutual events where the moon moves in front of the planetary disk ( early mutual events ) or behind it ( late mutual events ) .",
    "events i and iv will be late by @xmath3 compared to events ii and iii , respectively .",
    "imagine that two mutual events , either i and [ ii or iii ] or iv and [ iii or ii ] ) , are observed during two different stellar transits and that the moon has completed @xmath4 circumplanetary orbits between the two mutual events .",
    "then it is possible to determine the sequence of late and early eclipses , and therefore the som with respect to the circumstellar movement , if ( 1 ) the orbital period of the planetary satellite ( @xmath5 ) can be determined independently with an accuracy @xmath6 , and if ( 2 ) the event mid - times can be measured with a precision @xmath7 . as a byproduct ,",
    "measurements of @xmath8 yield an estimate for @xmath9 .    concerning ( 1 ) ,",
    "the planet s transit timing variation ( ttv ) and transit duration variation ( tdv ) due to the moon combined may constrain the satellite mass ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath5 @xcite . as an example , if two mutual events of a jupiter - ganymede system at 0.5au around a sun - like star were observed after 10 stellar transits ( or 3.5yr ) , the moon ( @xmath11yr ) would have completed @xmath12 circumplanetary orbits . hence , @xmath13 would be required . a combination of ttv and tdv measurements",
    "might be able to deliver such an accuracy ( section  6.5.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for our estimates of @xmath8",
    ", we can safely approximate that a moon enters a mutual event at a radial distance @xmath2 to the planet , because    @xmath14    with @xmath15 being the speed of light , @xmath16 the planetary radius , and @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 as shown in figure  [ fig : geometry](e ) . for a moon at @xmath19 from its planet , such as ganymede around jupiter , @xmath20 and @xmath21s , which is completely negligible .",
    "orbital eccentricities could also cause light travel times different from the one shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "but even for eccentricities comparable to titan s value around saturn , with 0.0288 the largest among the major moons in the solar system , ttds would be affected by @xmath22 , or fractions of a second .",
    "significantly larger eccentricities are unlikely , as they will be tidally eroded within a million years @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectra ]    in the solar system , all planets except venus @xcite and uranus rotate in the same direction as they orbit the sun",
    ". one would expect that the orbital motion of a moon is aligned with the rotation of the planet .",
    "however , collisions , gravitational perturbations , capture scenarios etc .",
    "can substantially alter a satellite s orbital plane @xcite .",
    "hence , knowledge about the spin - orbit misalignment , or obliquity , in a planet - exomoon system would be helpful in inferring its formation and evolution .",
    "one such method to constrain obliquities is the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( rme ) , a distortion in the rotationally broadened absorption lines caused by the partial occultation of the rotating sphere ( typically a star ) by a transiting body ( usually another star or a planet ) .",
    "this distortion can either be measured directly @xcite or be picked up as an rv shift during transit .",
    "the shape of this anomalous rv curve reveals the projection of the angle between the orbital normal of the occulting body ( in our case the moon ) and the rotation axis of the occulted body ( here the planet ) .",

    "the _ stellar _ rme of exomoons has been studied before @xcite , but here we refer to the rme in the _ planetary _ infrared spectrum caused by the moon transiting a hot , young giant planet .",
    "[ fig : ttd ]    for this method to be effective , a giant planet s light needs to be measured directly . starting with the planetary system around hr8799 @xcite and the planet candidate fomalhautb @xcite ,",
    "18 giant exoplanets have now been directly imaged , most of which are hot ( @xmath23k ) , and young ( @xmath24myr ) .",
    "upcoming instruments like sphere @xcite and gpi @xcite promise a rapid increase of this number .",
    "stellar and planetary spectra can also be separated in velocity space without the need of spatial separation @xcite , but for @xmath0pic - like systems , instruments like crires can also separate stellar and planetary spectra spatially . @xcite determined the rotation period of @xmath0picb to be @xmath25 hours .",
    "the high rotation velocity ( @xmath26 ) favors a large rme amplitude , but makes rv measurements more difficult .",
    "contamination of the planetary spectrum by the star via direct stellar light on the detector and stellar reflections from the planet might pose a challenge .",
    "consequently , observations need to be carried out in the near - ir , where the planet is relatively bright and presents a rich forest of spectral absorption lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows that contamination of the planetary spectrum .",
    "] by reflected star light becomes negligible beyond several 10au , with no need for additional cleaning .",
    "[ fig : prob ]    we computed the ttds of the ten largest moons in the solar system , yielding values between about 2 and 12s ( figure  [ fig : ttd ] ) .",
    "most intriguingly , the largest moons ( ganymede , titan , and callisto ) , which have the deepest solar transit signatures , also have the largest ttds .",
    "this is owed to the location of the water ice line in the accretion disks around jovian planets , which causes the most massive icy satellites to form beyond about @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ttd ] indicates that timing precisions of 1 - 6s need to be achieved on transit events with depths of only about @xmath28 , corresponding to the transit depth of an earth - sized moon transiting a sun - like star .",
    "precisions of 6s in exoplanet transit mid - times have been achieved from the ground using the baade 6.5 m telescope at las campanas observatory in chile @xcite . on the one hand , the planet in these observations ( wasp-4b ) was comparatively large to its host star with a transit depth of about 2.4%",
    ". on the other hand , the star was not particularly bright , with an apparent visual magnitude @xmath29 .",
    "the photon collecting power of the e - elt will be @xmath30 times that of the baade telescope . and with improved data reduction methods , timing precisions of the order of seconds should be obtainable for transit depths of @xmath28 with the e - elt for very nearby transiting systems .",
    "we calculate the probabilities of one to four mutual events ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) during a stellar transit of a coplanar planet - moon system .",
    "the distance of the moon travelled on its circumplanetary orbit during the stellar transit @xmath33 , with @xmath34 denoting the circumstellar orbital semi - major axis of the planet - moon barycenter and @xmath35 being its circumstellar orbital period .",
    "we analyze a jupiter - like planet at 1au from a sun - like star and simulate @xmath36 transits for a range of possible moon semi - major axes , respectively , where the moon s initial orbital position during the stellar transit is randomized .",
    "as the stellar transit occurs , we follow the moon s circumplanetary orbit and measure the number of mutual events ( of type i , ii , iii , or iv ) during the transit , which can be 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , or even 4 .    for siblings of io , europa , ganymede , and callisto",
    "we find @xmath37 , 13 , 8 , and 5% as well as @xmath38 , 24 , 11 , and 5% , respectively ( figure  [ fig : prob ] ) .",
    "notably , the probabilities for two mutual events ( purple long - dashed line ) are higher than the likelihoods for only one ( red solid line ) if @xmath39 km . for moons inside about half - way between io and europa , the probability of having no event ( black solid line ) is @xmath40 , so it is more likely to have at least one mutual event during any transit than having none . moons inside 200,000 km ( half the semi - major axis of io ) can even have three or more events , allowing the ttd method to work with only one stellar transit .",
    "deviations from well - aligned orbits due to high transit impact parameters or tilted moon orbits would naturally reduce the shown probabilities . nevertheless , mutual events could obviously be common during transits .",
    "a single stellar transit with @xmath41 mutual events contains ttd information on its own .",
    "a two - event stellar transit only delivers ttd information if the events are either a combination of i and ii or of iii and iv .",
    "moons in wide orbits can not proceed from one conjunction to the other during one stellar transit .",
    "hence , the contribution of ttd - containing events along @xmath42 is zero beyond about @xmath36 km . in close orbits ,",
    "the fraction of two - event cases with ttd information is @xmath43 . for io , as an example , @xmath44 .",
    "so even for very close - in moons , two - event cases with ttd information are rare .",
    "[ fig : rme ]    we simulated the rme in the near - ir spectrum of a planet similar to @xmath0picb assuming a planetary rotation speed of @xmath45 @xcite and a jovian planetary radius ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the moon was placed in a ganymede - like orbit ( @xmath47 ) and assumed to belong to the population of giant moons that form at the water ice lines around super - jovian planets , with a radius of up to about @xmath48 earth radii ( @xmath49 ) @xcite . using the code of @xcite , we simulated absorption lines of the rotating planet as distorted during the moon s transit with a cadence of 15min . focusing on the same spectral window ( @xmath50 ) as @xcite , we then convolved the planetary spectrum ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) with these distorted absorption lines .",
    "employing the crires exposure time calculator and incorporating the increase of @xmath51 in collecting area for the e - elt , we obtain a s /",
    "n of 75 per pixel for a 15min exposure  the same values as obtained by @xcite for a similar calculation .",
    "the resulting pseudo - observed spectra are finally cross - correlated with the template spectrum , and a gaussian is fitted to the cross - correlation functions to obtain rvs .",
    "pro- and retrograde coplanar orbits are clearly distinguishable in the resulting rme curve ( figure  [ fig : rme ] ) .",
    "in particular , the rme amplitude of @xmath52 is quite substantial . in comparison ,",
    "the rme amplitude of hd209458b is @xmath53 @xcite , and recent rme detections probe down to @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we present two new methods to determine an exomoon s sense of orbital motion . one method , which we refer to as the transit timing dichotomy , is based on a light travelling effect that occurs in subsequent mutual planet - moon eclipses during stellar transits .",
    "for the ten largest moons in the solar system , ttds range between 2 and 12s .",
    "if the planet - moon orbital period can be determined independently ( e.g. via ttv and tdv measurements ) and with an accuracy of @xmath55 , or if a very close - in moon shows at least three mutual events during one stellar transit , then ttd can uniquely determine the sequence of planet - moon eclipses . to resolve the ttd effect , photometric accuracies of @xmath28 need to be obtained along with mid - event precisions @xmath56s , which should be possible with the e - elt .",
    "if an exomoon is self - luminous , e.g. due to extreme tidal heating @xcite , and shows regular planet - moon transits and eclipses every few days , its ttd might be detectable without the need of stellar transits .",
    "eccentricities as small as 0.001 can trigger tidal surface heating rates on large moons that could be detectable with the james webb space telescope @xcite .",
    "but ttd measurements do not require such an extreme scenario , which does not support the conclusion of @xcite that mutual events can only be used to determine an exomoon s som if the moon s own brightness can be measured . in general ,",
    "ttds can be used to verify the prograde or retrograde motion of a moon with respect to the circumstellar motion",
    ".    the second method is based on measurements of the ir spectrum emitted by a young , luminous giant planet .",
    "we present simulations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect imposed by a transiting moon on a planetary spectrum .",
    "the largest moons that can possibly form in the circumplanetary accretion disks , halfway between ganymede and earth in terms of radii , can cause an rme that will be comfortably detectable with an ir spectrograph like crires mounted to an elt .",
    "a larger throughput or larger spectral coverage than the current non - cross - dispersed crires will make it possible to determine the som of smaller moons , maybe similar to the ones we have in the solar system .",
    "a moon - induced planetary rme can determine the moon s orbital motion with respect to the planetary rotation .",
    "combined observations of an exomoon s ttd , its planetary rme as well as the moon s stellar rme @xcite and the inclination between the moon s circumplanetary orbit and the planet s circumstellar orbit @xcite can potentially characterize an exomoon orbit in full detail .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that a moon s transit probability in front of a giant planet is about an order of magnitude higher than that of a planet around a star .",
    "a typical terrestrial planet at 0.5au from a sun - like star has a transit probability of @xmath57 . for comparison ,",
    "the galilean moons orbit jupiter at distances of about 6.1 , 9.7 , 15.5 , and @xmath58 , implying transit probabilities of up to about 16% . with orbital periods of a few days ,",
    "moon transits occur also much more frequently than for a common kepler planet .",
    "permanent , highly - accurate ir photometric monitoring of a few dozen directly imaged giant exoplanets thus has a high probability of finding an extrasolar moon .",
