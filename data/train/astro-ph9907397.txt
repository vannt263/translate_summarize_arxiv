    "almost all ultraluminous infrared galaxies [ uligs : @xmath5 m ) @xmath6 l@xmath3 ] have optical / near - infrared morphologies indicative of galaxy - galaxy mergers ( e.g. joseph & wright 1985 ; armus , heckman , & miley 1987 ; sanders et al .",

    "their large quantities of dust and molecular gas ( e.g. , sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ; solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , as well as evidence of abundant young star clusters in many uligs ( e.g. surace et al . 1998 ) , are strong evidence of recent / ongoing star formation .",
    "molecular gas is also a likely source of fuel for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) such as quasars and radio galaxies , many of which have high @xmath8 and disturbed optical morphologies ( e.g. , stockton & mackenty 1983 ; mackenty & stockton 1984 ; heckman et al . 1986 ; smith & heckman 1989a , b ) , thus providing a possible connection between mergers and the building of supermassive nuclear black holes .",
    "pks 1345 + 12 ( iras 13451 + 1232 : @xmath9 l@xmath3 ) is a prime candidate for the link between the ulig phenomenon and radio galaxies . with a radio luminosity of @xmath10 w hz@xmath11 ,",

    "the ratios of the narrow optical emission lines in pks 1345 + 12 indicate that it contains a seyfert 2 nucleus ( sanders et al .",

    "further , recent near - infrared spectroscopic observations have detected broad ( @xmath20 2600 km s@xmath11 ) pa@xmath21 emission , indicating the presence of a quasar nucleus which is obscured at optical wavelengths ( veilleux , sanders , & kim 1997 ) .",
    "the near - infrared spectroscopy of pks 1345 + 12 illustrates the importance of probing the nature and distribution of obscured nuclear energy sources in uligs at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "such studies also complement co interferometry , which provides spatial and kinematic information of the molecular gas reservoirs in these dusty systems . in this _ letter _ , the superior resolution of the hst near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos : 0.10.2@xmath4 resolution at 12 @xmath1 m ) and the owens valley millimeter array ( @xmath14 resolution at 3 mm ) are used to show for the first time the spatial coincidence of the molecular gas and the radio - loud nucleus of pks 1345 + 12 .",

    "the basic observation and data reduction procedures are the same as those described in scoville et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; the total integration times per filter setting for these observations were 480 sec ( 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath1 m ) and 600 sec ( 2.2 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "flux calibration of the images were done using the scaling factors @xmath33 , and @xmath34 jy ( adu / sec)@xmath11 at 1.10 , 1.60 , and 2.22 @xmath1 m , respectively .",

    "aperture synthesis maps of co(@xmath0 ) and 2.7 mm continuum emission in pks 1345 + 12 were made with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array during five observing periods from 1996 september to 1997 may .",
    "the array consists of six 10.4 m telescopes , and the longest observed baseline was 242 m. each telescope was configured with @xmath35 mhz digital correlators . during the observations , the nearby quasar",

    "finally , flux calibration observations of uranus were obtained .",
    "the ovro data were reduced and calibrated using the standard owens valley data reduction package mma ( scoville et al .",
    "the data were then exported to the mapping program difmap ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1995 ) .",

    "low level surface brightness emission envelops both nuclei , with an east - west extent of 11@xmath4 ( 22 kpc ; full width at 0.5% the maximum flux density at 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath1 m ) , and a 5.5@xmath4 ( 11 kpc ) southern extent beyond the southeastern nucleus ( hereafter pks 1345 + 12se ) .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile does not constrain the nature of the progenitor galaxies or the type of galaxy they are evolving into ; both an @xmath42 law and an exponential disk give reasonable fits to the profile ( see also scoville et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "pks 1345 + 12se is observed to be extended at all three wavelengths with a fwhm of 0.15@xmath4 ( 300 pc ) at 1.1 @xmath1 m .",
    "the measured 1.1@xmath4 aperture magnitudes are 16.86 , 15.85 , and 15.31 at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath1 m , respectively , and the derived colors are thus @xmath43 = 1.01 and @xmath44 = 0.54 . in contrast ,",
    "the northwestern nucleus ( hereafter pks 1345 + 12nw ) is unresolved with a fwhm of 0.11@xmath4 ( 220 pc ) at 1.1 @xmath1 m and magnitudes of 16.66 , 15.45 , and 13.96 at at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "the near - infrared colors of pks 1345 + 12nw are extremely red ; @xmath43 = 1.20 and @xmath44 = 1.49 .",
    "the red nature of pks 1345 + 12nw relative to pks 1345 + 12se is also evident in the 1.1@xmath4-aperture flux density ratios of the two nuclei ; @xmath45 decreases from a value of 0.82 at 1.1 @xmath1 m to 0.29 at 2.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "both the co(@xmath0 ) emission and underlying 2.7 mm continuum in pks 1345 + 12 are unresolved .",
    "the continuum flux density is 0.31 jy and is consistent with a power - law extrapolation of the radio flux density ( e.g. steppe et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the co emission ( figure 2 ) has a @xmath46 km s@xmath11 , a flux density of 14@xmath47 jy km s@xmath11 , and a co luminosity of @xmath48 k km s@xmath11 pc@xmath19 .",
    "thus , the line profile and luminosity are consistent with those derived from nrao 12 m telescope observations of pks 1345 + 12 ( i.e. , @xmath49 k km s@xmath11 pc@xmath19 : mirabel et al .",

    "ranges from 25 m@xmath3 for a reasonable range of temperatures and densities , thus the molecular gas mass of pks 1345 + 12 may actually be as low as 1.6@xmath53 m@xmath3 . ] finally , using the fwhm beam of the co map ( 2.2@xmath4 ) , the molecular gas concentration is calculated to be @xmath542000 m@xmath3 pc@xmath55 , or @xmath54151500 times that observed in local early - type spiral galaxies ( e.g. , young & scoville 1991 ) and comparable to the concentrations observed in a sample of luminous infrared galaxies observed by scoville et al .",

    "the interpretation of the data presented in this _ letter _ depends on accurate astrometry of the multiwavelength images . to determine the coordinates of the two nuclei of pks 1345 + 12",
    ", the positions of stars within 3.5@xmath40 of the galaxy were first retrieved from the usno - a1.0 database . a plate solution ( world coordinate system ) was then derived for a @xmath56 _ r_-band image ( kim 1995 ) , which also shows the two nuclei of pks 1345 + 12 , using the iraf task pltsol .",
    "the coordinates of the two nuclei , along with the positions of the co and radio emission from the galaxy , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the radio and co emission appear to be spatially coincident with pks 1345 + 12nw - the measured near - infrared peak of pks 1345 + 12nw is displaced 0.3@xmath4 ne of the radio emission , but is within the uncertainties associated with the positions of the stars used to derive the position of the pks 1345 + 12 nuclei .",
    "likewise , the measured near - infrared peak of pks 1345 + 12nw is displaced @xmath57 ne of the co emission and continuum centroids , consistent with the measured ovro beamsize ( see figure 1d ) .",
    "the bulk of the activity in pks 1345 + 12 is associated with pks 1345 + 12nw .",
    "the derived nicmos colors of the two nuclei provides further support that the agn resides in pks 1345 + 12nw .",
    "while the colors of pks 1345 + 12se are consistent with starlight reddened by 15 magnitudes of dust , pks 1345 + 12nw has colors similar to other warm uligs observed with nicmos - i.e. , similar to optically - selected quasars with a 5001000 k dust component ( see also scoville et al .",
    "1999 and the summary in evans 1999a ) .",
    "similar results are derived from near - infrared ground - based observations of pks 1345 + 12 ( e.g. , surace & sanders 1999 ) , and recent , high - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy ( veilleux & sanders 1999 ) confirm that pks 1345 + 12 is the source of the broad - lines detected by veilleux , sanders , & kim ( 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of a large and concentrated reservoir of molecular gas in pks 1345 + 12nw is consistent with the notion that this gas is a source of fuel for the radio phenomenon ( e.g. , mirabel et al .",
    "1989 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the molecular gas in the western galaxy is driven inward via gravitational instabilities induced by interactions with pks 1345 + 12se .",
    "of all of the radio galaxies detected in co(@xmath0 ) to date ( phillips et al .",
    "1987 ; mirabel et al . 1989 ; mazzarella et al . 1993",
    "; evans 1999b ; evans et al .",
    "1999 ) , pks 1345 + 12 is the most molecular gas - rich , and the only one that clearly has two nuclei .",
    "thus , while pks 1345 + 12 is an advanced merger in terms of its relatively small nuclear separation , the fact that the stellar nuclei are 4 kpc apart implies that this system is dynamically younger than the other radio galaxies observed . if the assumption is made that the nuclei of pks1345 + 12 are gravitationally bound ,",
    "the relative velocity of the merging galaxies is @xmath58 km s@xmath11 , where @xmath59 m@xmath3 and @xmath60 kpc , and thus the merger has at least an additional @xmath61 years before the nuclei coalesce .    from the extent of the radio emission",
    ", it is also clear that the jet activity commenced fairly recently . in the 2.3 and 8.5 ghz radio maps shown in fey ,",
    "clegg , & fomalont ( 1996 ) , the radio jet has a maximum extent of 0.10@xmath4 ( @xmath62 pc ) .",
    "thus , if the jet propagates at a speed of 0.1@xmath63 , it can be no more than 7000 years old .",
    "for comparison , the linear extent of the jets associated with single - nuclei radio galaxies detected in co are 10200 kpc , but their estimated jet ages ( @xmath64 years ) are significantly less than the timescale of the merger process ( @xmath65 years ) .",
    "the creation of the radio jets so late in the life of the merger can be understood in terms of merger dynamics - there will be a natural offset in the time at which the merger begins and the agn activity occurs because of the time it takes for the molecular gas to agglomerate in the nuclear regions of the galaxy .",
    "further , depending on how typical such a delay is in radio galaxies , the consumption of molecular gas by extended star formation may be well underway prior to the onset of the radio activity , and may continue for another @xmath66 years or so .",
    "this provides a natural explanation of why radio galaxies with older , extended jets are not observed to have large reservoirs of molecular gas ( i.e. , @xmath67 m@xmath3 : mazzarella et al .",
