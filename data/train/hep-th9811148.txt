    "in our previous publication @xcite we considered stationary axially symmetric membranes ( infinitely thin domain walls ) embedded in the background of a schwarzschild black hole . in the approximation when the gravitational field of a membrane can be neglected , the test membrane configuration is an extremal of the dirac - nambu - goto action .",
    "solutions for a membrane which spreads to spatial infinity form a one parameter family .",
    "we showed that three different 2 + 1 dimensional membrane topologies were possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity : minkowski topology , wormhole topology and black hole topology .",
    "moreover , we found that the three different membrane topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by choptuik @xcite , in investigations of scalar field collapse .",
    "besides the first order transition ( with mass gap ) between black - hole and wormhole topologies , there exists also a second order phase transition ( no mass gap ) between membranes of minkowski topology and membranes of black hole topology .",
    "the induced metric on the intermediate membrane for the latter transition has a naked singularity",
    ". for the membranes of black hole topology we found a mass - scaling relation analogous to that originally found by choptuik @xcite ( for a review , see for instance @xcite and references given therein ) .",
    "we showed that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an external parameter and @xmath7 , and we also found a periodic wiggle in the scaling relation with period @xmath8 .",
    "the one - parameter family of stationary axially symmetric membranes in the schwarzschild background thus essentially contains all the features of critical collapse in einstein theory of gravity , as have recently been discussed in the literature ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , there are two important differences in the physical setup : ( 1 ) in the case of membranes we are not actually considering the dynamical formation of black holes ; we are merely considering a one - parameter family of stationary membranes of which some have minkowski topology while others have black hole topology .",
    "( 2 ) in the case of membranes the induced 2 + 1 dimensional metric does not obey einstein equations but is determined by solving the dirac - nambu - goto equations .",
    "taking these differences into account , our results @xcite indicate that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far more general than originally expected .    in the present paper ,",
    "we continue the study of a test stationary membrane ( representing a thin domain wall ) interacting with a generic static black hole and demonstrate the universality of critical behavior in this system .",
    "the main observation is that all important features of this critical behavior are determined only by properties of the membrane solution in the close vicinity of the event horizon .",
    "the latter allows complete analytical study .",
    "we start by considering a one - parameter family of uniformly accelerating axially symmetric membranes in flat minkowski space , and demonstrate that already this very simple system contains all the features discussed above .",
    "we use the results of analytical study of uniformly accelerated membranes to obtain the characteristics of critical behavior in the general case of a membrane interacting with a black hole .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ memsec ] , we study membranes in rindler space and describe a one - parameter family of membranes which are stationary in a rindler frame .",
    "we also discuss some general properties of these solutions . in section [ critsec ] , we give a different mathematical description of the problem in terms of phase - portrait and critical points .",
    "this will shed light on some general properties of the membrane solutions . in section [ analyticsec ]",
    "we derive analytically the so - called mass - scaling relation , that is , the exact expression of the  2 + 1 dimensional mass \" of the black hole topology membranes in terms of an external `` impact '' parameter . in section [ lastsec ] , we return to the problem of stationary membranes in the black - hole background @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that mass - scaling relation is valid , and obtain _ exact _ analytical expressions for the scaling exponent and the wiggle - period .",
    "finally in section [ conclsec ] , we discuss the obtained results .",
    "our starting point is the dirac - nambu - goto action @xcite @xmath9 describing a test membrane in an external gravitational field @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the membrane tension , and @xmath12 the induced metric on the world - volume .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) spacetime coordinates , while @xmath15 are coordinates on the membrane world - volume .",
    "we consider first axially symmetric membranes in flat minkowski space which are stationary in a rindler frame , that is , stationary as seen by a uniformly accelerating observer in minkowski space .",
    "the line - element of minkowski space in rindler frame is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the acceleration in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the stationary axially symmetric membranes are parametrized as follows @xmath19 for such membranes the equations of motion , corresponding to the action ( [ action ] ) , reduce to the following second order non - linear ordinary differential equation @xmath20 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "a general solution of this equation depends on 2 arbitrary constants .",
    "points where @xmath21 or @xmath22 are singular points of the equation .",
    "we shall see later that solutions which are regular at these singular points form a 1-parameter family .",
    "equation ( [ eom ] ) is non - integrable . to demonstrate this , we introduce parametrization @xmath23 , where the parameter @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 then eqs .",
    "( [ eom ] ) , ( [ chaos1 ] ) become @xmath26 which are exactly the hamilton equations corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath27 a hamiltonian similar to ( [ chaos3 ] ) but with the opposite sign of the potential , is well - known in the literature in connection with yang - mills equations @xcite , and the corresponding dynamics has in fact been shown to be chaotic @xcite .",
    "the system is thus non - integrable , and the change of sign in the potential does not affect this property .    a general solution to eq . ( [ eom ] )",
    "can therefore not be obtained in explicit form , but a very simple special solution is provided by @xmath28 this solution will turn out to play a very special role in our context of membranes , 2 + 1 dimensional black holes and critical phenomena .",

    "the scalar curvature corresponding to the 2 + 1 dimensional geometries ( [ indmet ] ) is @xmath37 so that @xmath38 but asymptotically @xmath39 . in other words ,",
    "the induced geometry is asymptotically flat at infinity @xmath40 .",
    "the induced curvature @xmath41 diverges at points where either @xmath21 or @xmath22 unless the following conditions are satisfied @xmath42 @xmath43 these boundary conditions single out _ regular _ stationary ( for a rindler observer ) axially symmetric membranes in minkowski space .",
    "imposing these conditions reduces the number of independent parameters characterizing a solution from 2 to 1 .",
    "some examples of solutions from the 1-parameter family of regular solutions are shown in figs .",
    "[ solfig ] , [ sollogfig ] , and the parameter space is shown in fig .",

    "membranes obeying boundary condition ( [ bci ] ) have the topology of 2 + 1 dimensional minkowski spacetime , and can be thought of as deformed versions of a planar membrane .",
    "an induced geometry for a membrane obeying boundary condition @xmath44 for some @xmath45 , ( [ bcii ] ) , has an apparent horizon at @xmath21 .",
    "these solutions describe a 2 + 1 dimensional black hole with `` area '' @xmath46    an exceptional case is provided by the particular solution ( [ critsol ] ) .",
    "this membrane , which is the limiting solution separating the minkowski topology membranes from the black hole topology membranes , has the topology of a cone , and its induced metric has a naked singularity at @xmath47 .",
    "comparing with the results of the critical collapse in 3 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity @xcite , the results of this section already suggest a close connection .",
    "in particular , the  critical \" membrane solution ( [ critsol ] ) , separating the minkowski topology membranes from the black hole topology membranes , has a naked singularity and it is continuously self - similar in the sense that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the induced metric ( [ indmetdef ] ) for the critical solution ( [ critsol ] ) , and the vector @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 for the membranes with black hole topology , it is convenient to use as the  external parameter \" @xmath52 with this definition , the critical solution ( [ critsol ] ) corresponds to @xmath53 , and @xmath6 is a monotonically decreasing parameter when approaching the critical solution ; see fig .",
    "[ abfig ] .",
    "the goal is now to obtain the so - called  mass - scaling \" relation , i.e. the relation between the apparent horizon area ( [ apphor ] ) and the parameter @xmath6 for the black hole topology membranes .",
    "it should be stressed that , as in the case of scalar field collapse @xcite , the precise form of the mass - scaling relation obviously depends on the precise definition of the  external parameter \" @xmath6 . in the present case",
    "we find that , due to the asymptotic form ( [ asymbeh ] ) , the definition ( [ paramdef ] ) is the most natural . in the case of stationary membranes in the schwarzschild background @xcite ,",
    "a similar definition was used .",
    "before deriving mass - scaling relation , we give an alternative mathematical description of the differential equation ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new coordinates @xmath54 ( not to be confused with those of eqs .",
    "( [ chaos1])-([chaos3 ] ) ) by @xmath55 as well as a new parameter @xmath24 @xmath56 then eq . ( [ eom ] )",
    "becomes a first order regular autonomous system @xmath57 the corresponding phase - portrait is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasefig ] .",
    "notice that there are four critical points ; @xmath58 one being a node , another being a saddle point and the last two are focus points .    the focus points ( [ focus ] ) , which in the phase - portrait are approached by self - similar ( logarithmic ) spirals , correspond to the two critical membranes @xmath59 . constraining ourselves to the one half part of spacetime @xmath60 lying above the rindler horizon , only the focus with positive @xmath61-component is relevant .",
    "the saddle point ( [ saddle ] ) precisely corresponds to the boundary condition ( [ bcii ] ) for the membranes of 2 + 1 dimensional black hole topology , that is @xmath62 the important consequence is that , when using these @xmath54-coordinates , _ all _ membranes of 2 + 1 dimensional black hole topology are represented by only one curve , namely the curve connecting the saddle point @xmath63 and the focus point @xmath64 .",
    "so it is necessary to make only one numerical integration of the system ( [ auto ] ) ; then _ all _ membranes of 2 + 1 dimensional black hole topology can be reconstructed . in the next section",
    "we shall see that this fact is closely related to a certain symmetry of the equation ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "notice also that the node @xmath65 is represented neither by the critical solution nor by any other solution obtained from the boundary conditions ( [ bci ] ) , ( [ bcii ] ) and hence it has no relevance here .",
    "now return to the original equation ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "there are two symmetries that will allow us to give a complete analytical description of the critical phenomena concerning the transition between membranes of 2 + 1 dimensional minkowski topology and membranes of 2 + 1 dimensional black hole topology .",
    "notice first that the boundary conditions ( [ bci ] ) , ( [ bcii ] ) are symmetric under interchange of @xmath66 and @xmath18 @xmath67 this symmetry actually extends to the solutions themselves as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) ( see also eq .",
    "( [ chaos2 ] ) ) . in our context",
    "it means that for any minkowski topology membrane @xmath68 , there is a corresponding black hole topology membrane @xmath69 with the same function @xmath70 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that if @xmath71 is a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) then , for arbitrary @xmath72 , @xmath73 is also a solution @xmath74 transformation ( [ sym2 ] ) preserves boundary condition ( [ bcii ] ) , but it shifts the apparent horizon ( [ apphor ] ) .",
    "thus , from one black hole topology membrane , we can construct all the others by the transformation ( [ sym2 ] ) . using the transformation ( [ sym1 ] )",
    ", we can then also construct all the minkowski topology membranes corresponding to the boundary conditions ( [ bci ] ) .    to make these statements more precise , consider some fixed  reference - solution \" @xmath75 ,",

    "notice that the points corresponding to minkowski topology membranes are obtained from the points corresponding to black hole topology membranes by inversion @xmath86 , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ sym1 ] ) .",
    "however , we can go one step further .",
    "consider again the relations ( [ transbc ] ) , ( [ transpiral ] ) for the black hole topology membranes .",
    "the transformation ( [ transpiral ] ) is a combined scaling and rotation in parameter space . since @xmath87 the rotation matrix can be written as a product of two rotation matrices",
    "; one involving only @xmath88 and the other involving only @xmath89 .",
    "that is , relations ( [ transpiral ] ) are equivalent to @xmath90 where the horizon area is measured in units of @xmath17 .",
    "it follows that the combination : @xmath91 is a constant vector , i.e. the same for _ all _ membranes of black hole topology . taking the norm and using definition ( [ paramdef ] ) finally leads to : @xmath92 it follows that we get the exact mass - scaling relation @xmath93 corresponding to a critical exponent @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is an unimportant constant .",
    "this exactly linear mass - scaling relation without any wiggle was to be expected due to the continuous self - similarity ( [ selfsim ] ) , ( [ selfsimvec ] ) , if we believe in the analogy with the case of scalar field collapse @xcite .",
    "the relation ( [ constfrac ] ) also implies that the  phase - transition \" between membranes of minkowski topology and membranes of black hole topology is of second order ( no mass gap ) .    in this section",
    "we have obtained the mass - scaling relation for the black hole topology membranes , that is , the super - critical solutions . however , since we have the exact symmetry ( [ sym1 ] ) , we could as well have obtained the scaling relation for the minkowski topology membranes , that is , the sub - critical solutions . in that case",
    "one would use instead of the apparent horizon area ( [ apphor ] ) , the minimal proper distance between the minkowski topology membrane and the rindler horizon .",
    "the scaling relations in the two cases would then obviously be identical .",
    "it is interesting to mention that such `` symmetry '' between sub - critical and super - critical scaling relations have been found numerically in the case of scalar field collapse also @xcite . in our case",
    ", this symmetry is completely trivial .",
    "in a previous publication @xcite , we considered stationary axially symmetric membranes in the schwarzschild spacetime @xmath96 such membranes are parametrized by @xmath97 and the equation of motion corresponding to the action ( [ action ] ) is @xmath98 where the prime now denotes derivative with respect to @xmath99 .    in reference",
    "@xcite we showed that three different membrane topologies were possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity : 2 + 1 dimensional minkowski topology , 2 + 1 dimensional wormhole topology and 2 + 1 dimensional black hole topology .",
    "we also found that the different membrane topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by choptuik @xcite in investigations of scalar field collapse .",
    "in particular , we found a second order phase transition ( no mass gap ) between membranes of minkowski topology and membranes of black hole topology .",
    "the corresponding mass - scaling relation for the black hole topology membranes was numerically found to have the approximate form @xmath100 where @xmath6 is the external parameter and @xmath101 is a periodic function with period @xmath102 .",
    "the numerical computations gave @xcite @xmath103 we shall now show analytically that @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and that these numbers are universal , in the sense that they hold true for stationary axially symmetric membranes in a variety of background spacetimes , including schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and rindler spacetimes ( in the latter case , the periodic function has zero amplitude , as will be discussed later ) .",
    "+ our main observation is that characteristics of critical behavior are determined only by properties of a membrane in the close vicinity of the event horizon of the background geometry . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider black - hole - topology membranes in the schwarzschild background , although the arguments are more general .",
    "it is well - known that the near - horizon region of a schwarzschild ( as of any other static ) black hole is rindler space . to be more precise ,",
    "consider the region near the @xmath106-pole : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , of the schwarzschild black hole , and define @xmath109 to the lowest order the line element ( [ schmetric ] ) then becomes @xmath110 which is precisely the rindler line element ( [ rindlermetric ] ) for @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , the membrane - embedding equation ( [ schembed ] ) becomes : @xmath112 which is precisely eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) near the horizon , since the terms on the right hand side are negligible there .    as in rindler space , a membrane in the schwarzschild spacetime is specified by a 2-vector @xmath113 which parametrizes the solutions of the embedding equation at spatial infinity . near the critical membrane ( which separates the minkowski topology membranes from the black hole topology membranes ) , it is convenient to choose the parametrization such that the critical membrane corresponds to @xmath114 and such that @xmath115 is a decreasing function when approaching the critical solution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . in the schwarzschild background ,",
    "the critical membrane enters the horizon at @xmath116 , @xmath117 where it has a naked singularity .",
    "near - critical membranes are thus described by equation ( [ schequ ] ) , with vanishing right hand side near the horizon .",
    "now consider such a near - critical membrane of black hole topology ; we think of this solution as being obtained by linearization around the critical membrane .",
    "the idea is then to first read off rindler - data @xmath118 in the rindler region , and then to relate this to the schwarzschild - data @xmath31 which we read off at spatial infinity .",
    "this makes sense since a membrane sufficiently close to the critical membrane will make a sufficient number of oscillations ( see fig .",

    "( [ asymbeh ] ) .",
