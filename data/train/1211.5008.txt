    "owing to its very high h@xmath0o production rate , c/1995 o1 hale - bopp  was a great comet in the night sky of the year 1997 .",
    "the visible emissions of atomic oxygen ( [ oi ] 6300 , 6364 , and 5577  ) , which are accessible to the ground - based optical instruments , have been observed by @xcite and @xcite in the coma of hale - bopp .",
    "since the lifetime of oxygen atom in the @xmath1d metastable state is relatively small ( @xmath5110 s ) compared to the photochemical lifetime of h@xmath0o ( @xmath58 @xmath6 10@xmath3 s ) , it can not travel larger distances in the coma without decaying to the ground @xmath2p state .",
    "moreover , most of the production of oxygen in the @xmath1d state is through photodissociative excitation of h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "thus , [ oi ] 6300    emission has been used to trace the spatial distribution as well as to quantify the production rate of h@xmath0o in several comets @xcite .",
    "based on the study of @xcite the intensity ratio of green ( 5577  ) to red - doublet ( 6300   and 6364  ) emissions ( here after g / r ratio ) of atomic oxygen has been used to determine whether the parent source of these lines is h@xmath0o or co@xmath0/co in the coma of comets @xcite .",
    "the modelling studies of these emissions in comets showed that photodissociative excitation of h@xmath0o is the major production process of the [ oi ] 6300   emission @xcite .",
    "our recent theoretical study @xcite for these prompt emissions of atomic oxygen in comet c/1996 b2 hyakutake  showed that more than 90% of the o(@xmath1d ) is populated via photodissociative excitation of h@xmath0o and the rest through photodissociation of other oxygen bearing species , like co@xmath0 and co. it also showed that quenching by h@xmath0o is the major loss mechanism of o(@xmath1d ) up to cometocentric distances of 1000 km , and above that distance radiative decay takes over .",
    "the study of @xcite demonstrated that the g / r ratio depends not only on the photochemistry involved in populating o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) atoms in the cometary coma , but also on the projected area observed for the comet , which is a function of slit dimension used for observation and geocentric distance of the comet .    in the present study we applied our coupled chemistry - emission model @xcite to comet c/1995 o1 hale - bopp , which had an order of magnitude higher h@xmath0o production rate compared to that of comet hyakutake , to evaluate the production and loss mechanisms of o(@xmath1d ) and o(@xmath1s ) and generation of green and red - doublet emissions .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the photo - attenuation in comets having high h@xmath0o production rates and its implications on the photochemistry of metastable o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) atoms .",
    "we compared our model calculated [ oi ] 6300   emission surface brightness profile with the observation of @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the photodissociation of h@xmath0o mainly controls the formation of o(@xmath1d ) and subsequently determines the intensity of [ oi ] 6300   emission . however , in the case of [ oi ] 5577   emission , the photodissociation of both h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 plays an important role in the formation of metastable o(@xmath1s ) , with photodissociation of co@xmath0 being the major production source of o(@xmath1s ) in the inner cometary coma .",
    "we suggest that in comets with significant ( @xmath75% ) co@xmath0 relative abundance , the photodissociation of co@xmath0 is more effective in populating o(@xmath1s ) than the photodissociation of h@xmath0o .",
    "the model calculated g / r ratio is consistent with the observed value of @xcite .",
    "based on the model results , we suggest that the involvement of multiple species in the formation o(@xmath1s ) could be a reason for the width of the green line emission to be larger than the red - doublet emission lines observed in several comets by @xcite .",
    "the details of the model and the chemistry are presented in our previous work @xcite . here",
    "we present the input parameters that have been used in the model for the observed condition of comet hale - bopp on 10 march 1997 ( solar radio flux f10.7 = 74.7 @xmath6 10@xmath8",
    "j s@xmath9 m@xmath10 hz@xmath9 ) when it was at a geocentric distance ( @xmath11 ) of 1.32 au and a heliocentric distance ( @xmath12 ) of 0.93 au .",
    "the photochemical reaction network and cross sections for photon and electron impact processes are same as used in the previous work and any changes made are mentioned .",
    "the degradation of solar euv - generated photoelectrons is accounted by using analytical yield spectrum ( ays ) technique which is based on the monte - carlo method @xcite .",
    "details of the ays approach and the method to calculate photoelectron flux and excitation rates are given in our earlier papers @xcite .",
    "[ 0.8 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to evaluate the role of slit dimension in determining the g / r ratio we calculated green and red line intensities for various slit sizes by keeping h@xmath0o , co and co@xmath0 production rates as a constant .",
    "these calculations are presented in table  [ tab - slt ] . by varying the slit dimension from 2@xmath13 @xmath6 2@xmath13 to 10@xmath14 @xmath6 10@xmath14 the calculated g / r ratio over the projected cometary coma changed from 0.3 to 0.08 .",
    "this result clearly shows that the g / r ratio depends not only on the photo - chemistry in the coma but also on the projected area observed for the comet . the calculated g / r ratio is a constant value ( 0.08 ) throughout the cometary coma when collisional quenching is neglected in the model . by doubling the co@xmath0 relative abundance in the coma , the g / r ratio increases by 30% whereas the collisional quenching of o(@xmath1d ) and o(@xmath1s )",
    "can change its value even by an order of magnitude .    besides the dimension of the slit used for observation , the projected area observed on the comet",
    "depends on geocentric distance of the comet . hence in a comet , where the collisional coma is resolvable in the observation , the derived g / r ratio depends on the projected area and also on the collisional quenching of o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) in the cometary coma .",
    "thus , we conclude that the observed g / r ratio of 0.1 is not a definitive benchmark value to verify h@xmath0o or co@xmath0/co as the parent sources of atomic oxygen visible emissions in comets .",
    "@xcite has found that the width of green line is higher than either of the red - doublet lines in the spectra of 8 comets .",
    "the wider green line implies the higher mean velocity of metastable o(@xmath1s ) , which could be associated with different production processes . besides collisions with different cometary species , the mean velocity of o(@xmath1s ) in the cometary coma is determined by various production processes , and/or could be due to the involvement of photons of various energies in dissociating o - bearing species @xcite .",
    "the observed width of forbidden line emission depends on the velocity distribution of radiating metastable oxygen atoms .",
    "we found that the excess velocity released in photodissociation h@xmath0o in the unity radiative efficiency region is 2.1 ev ( cf .",
    "figure  [ exvel ] ) .",
    "if we assume that most of this excess energy is transfered to kinetic motion of atomic oxygen then the maximum mean velocity that can be acquired by the o(@xmath1d ) atom would be 1.6 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this velocity is consistent with values of 0.5 to 1.8 km s@xmath9 derived by @xcite in 8 comets .",
    "this supports the idea that most of the red - doublet emission in cometary coma is governed by the photodissociation of h@xmath0o .",
    "the excess energy profiles shown in figure  [ exvel ] suggest that the o(@xmath1d ) produced in photodissociation of co and co@xmath0 will have higher velocity than that produced in photodissociation of h@xmath0o .",
    "the excess energy released in the photodissociation of co and co@xmath0 in the unity radiative efficiency region is 2.5 ev and 4.1 ev , which corresponds to o(@xmath1d ) excess velocity of @xmath53.7 km s@xmath9 and 4 km s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "however , our calculations suggest that co and co@xmath0 together can contribute to a maximum of 10% to the red - doublet emission .",
    "the contributions of co and co@xmath0 in the wings of red - doublet lines are probable .    in the case of green line emission ,",
    "since there is no experimentally determined cross section or yield for the photodissociation of h@xmath0o producing o(@xmath1s ) , it is difficult to determine the mean velocity acquired by an o(@xmath1s ) atom in the the photolysis of h@xmath0o .",
    "the maximum excess energy that can be released in photolysis of h@xmath0o producing o(@xmath1s ) at solar h ly-@xmath15 is 1.27 ev .",
    "again , if we assume all the excess energy is transferred as kinetic energy of atomic oxygen in @xmath1s state then the maximum excess velocity of o(@xmath1s ) would be 1.3 km s@xmath9 .",
    "but in the case of photodissociation of co@xmath0 , the excess energy is 2.5 ev , which corresponds to a maximum o(@xmath1s ) velocity of 4.3 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the dissociative recombination of ions h@xmath0o@xmath16 , co@xmath17 , and co@xmath16 can contribute a maximum of 30% in the production of green line emission .",
    "but the excess energy released in these recombination reactions is very small @xcite . by assuming that the maximum mean velocity that can be acquired by o(@xmath1s ) via the dissociative recombination processes is about 1 km s@xmath9",
    ", we found that the mean velocity of o(@xmath1s ) from all production processes is @xmath52 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this value is consistent with the derived velocity range of 1.9 to 3.1 km s@xmath9 for o(@xmath1s ) in 8 comets by @xcite .    before coming to a broad conclusion",
    ", we suggest that one has to calculate the exact mean excess velocities of o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) over the observed cometary coma , by accounting for all collisional processes and the mean excess velocity profiles of various species . due to non availability of photon cross sections for some of the photodissociation processes , and uncertainties involved in the excess energy calculations for dissociative recombination reactions ,",
    "our model is limited in determining the exact line widths of green and red - doublet emissions .",
    "however , based on our model calculations on comets hale - bopp  and hyakutake , we suggest that involvement of multiple sources in the formation o(@xmath1s ) could be a potential reason for the higher line width of green emission compared to that of red - doublet emission observed in several comets .",
    "as we mentioned earlier in the section  [ sec : model ] , we have used the velocity profile from the work of @xcite for calculating the number densities of parent species h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , and co. @xcite have shown that there is an acceleration of neutrals in the inner coma due to the photolytic heating @xcite and other processes @xcite . to evaluate the impact of this acceleration on our model results we carried out calculations by taking a constant gas expansion velocity profile with the values 0.7 and 2.2 km s@xmath9 . by using a constant velocity profile of 0.7 km s@xmath9 in the coma , rather than a radially varying velocity of @xcite ,",
    "the calculated intensities of green and red - doublet emissions are increased by 30% and 25% , respectively , which are still higher than the observation . by changing the constant gas expansion velocity from 0.7 to 2.2 km s@xmath9 ,",
    "the calculated intensities of atomic oxygen emission lines are decreased by @xmath550% . however using the @xcite velocity profile , our calculated [ oi ] 6300   emission intensities over 4@xmath14 circular aperture field of view are closer to the observation ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab - day ] ) .",
    "hence , the velocity profile of neutral species is an important input in the model that should be accounted in calculating the intensities of these forbidden emissions .      the water production rate in comet",
    "hale - bopp  has been derived using emissions of direct and daughter products of h@xmath0o by different observers @xcite . during the observation period of these green and red - doublet emissions",
    "( r@xmath18 of the comet was around 0.9 au ) , @xcite measured the h@xmath0o production rates using infrared emissions of water molecules for different days . in this period , @xcite derived the h@xmath0o production rate in this comet using h ly-@xmath15 emission .",
    "the difference between these two derived production rates is less than 20% .",
    "these observations found that around 1 au the water production rate in comet hale - boppwas about @xmath51 @xmath6 10@xmath19 s@xmath9 .",
    "similarly , the derived water production rates of @xcite on 1997 march 3 was 6.1 @xmath6 10@xmath20 s@xmath9 which is smaller than the @xcite derived rate by a factor of 1.5 . using visible emission of atomic oxygen @xcite derived the h@xmath0o production rates by applying standard branching ratios of oh and h@xmath0o .",
    "these derived h@xmath0o production rates are higher by factor of 3 to 6 compared to values determined from other observations . to assess the impact of h@xmath0o production rate on the calculated green and red - doublet emissions we increased its value by a factor of 5 .",
    "with increase in h@xmath0o production rate the model calculated surface brightness of green and red - doublet emissions over 4@xmath14 circular field of view is increased by a factor of 3 .    as demonstrated earlier in this paper , the role of co@xmath0 is very significant in determining the green line emission intensity and subsequently the g / r ratio . during the observation period of these forbidden emission lines the co@xmath0",
    "is not observed in this comet . to evaluate the impact of co@xmath0 we varied its relative abundance from 3 to 6% .",
    "we found an increase ( 25% ) in the calculated green line emission intensity over the 4@xmath14 circular aperture field of view whereas it is small ( @xmath215% ) for red - doublet emission intensity .",
    "based on infrared observations made near perihelion on comet hale - bopp , @xcite suggested that 50% of co abundance present in the cometary coma is contributed by distributed sources .",
    "@xcite investigated the extended distribution of co by probing hale - bopp  between @xmath5800 to @xmath520,000 km region using co rotational line emissions ( viz , co j(1 - 0 ) and co j(2 - 1 ) ) .",
    "based on the observation and radiative transfer modelling studies , @xcite rejected the idea of an extended distribution of co in hale - bopp .",
    "since the contribution of photodissociation of co to formation of o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) is less than 10% , no significant variation in the calculated intensity of green and red - doublet emissions is found by reducing the co relative abundance by half .",
    "hence , the involvement of co in these oxygen forbidden line emissions is almost insignificant .",
    "though oh column densities are determined using 3080   surface brightness profile , there are large uncertainties in photo - cross sections of oh in producing o(@xmath1d ) and o(@xmath1s ) @xcite .",
    "the calculated photo - rates for the production of o(@xmath1d ) via photodissociation of oh , using theoretical and experimental cross sections differ by about an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of these cross sections in deriving the h@xmath0o production rates using 6300   surface brightness profile and found that on using the theoretical oh photodissociative branching ratios of o(@xmath1d ) , the derived h@xmath0o production rates are higher by a factor of 36 , than those determined based on experimental branching ratios of @xcite .",
    "the photodissociation of oh influences the calculated green and red - doublet emission intensities significantly above 10@xmath3 km ( cf . figs .",
    "[ prat - o1s ] and [ prat - o1d ] , and table  [ tabprj ] ) . by changing photorates determined by @xcite",
    "experimental cross sections ( which are used in the model ) with the rates derived based on theoretically calculated cross sections of @xcite , we found a 40% decrease in the calculated slit - averaged brightness over the 4@xmath14 circular aperture field of view for both green and red - doublet emissions .",
    "but the calculated o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) production rates along the radial distances are decreased by an order of magnitude above 10@xmath3 km . since",
    "oh is the dominant o - bearing species in the outer coma , the cross sections can affect the calculated the surface brightness of [ oi ] 6300   at larger projected distances ( @xmath2210@xmath23 km ) . to fit the observed [ oi ] 6300 emission in",
    "the outer coma @xcite found it necessary to increase theoretical determined oh to o(@xmath1d ) photorate by a factor of around 3 .",
    "the chemistry model developed by @xcite suggested that the collisions of o(@xmath2p ) with oh leads to the formation of o@xmath0 .",
    "these calculations also showed that the o@xmath0 densities can be as high as 1% of h@xmath0o .",
    "we evaluated the change in green and red - doublet emission intensities by incorporating o@xmath0 in the model by taking its density profiles from @xcite .",
    "no significant change ( @xmath215% ) is found in the green and red - doublet emission intensities by including o@xmath0 in the model .",
    "this is because the other o - bearing species are several orders of magnitude higher in the inner coma .      as a case study , for a fixed h@xmath0o production rate and co and co@xmath0 relative abundances",
    ", we calculated [ oi ] 6300   emission intensity over a projected field of view for different slit dimensions .",
    "we then derived the o(@xmath1d ) production rate based on the calculated average [ oi ] 6300 emission intensity over the projected field view .",
    "these calculations are presented in table  [ tab - slt ] . since",
    "our model calculations are limited up to the projected distances of 10@xmath23 km ( which is discussed in section  [ sec - lim ] ) we present the calculated intensities of [ oi ] 6300 and 5577   emissions for the slit dimension up to 10@xmath14 @xmath6 10@xmath14 . though o(@xmath1d ) is substantially produced in the inner coma via photodissociation , the collisional quenching by cometary species results in a very few [ oi ] 6300  photons .",
    "the role of quenching in determining the [ oi ] 6300   flux can be understood from the calculated values presented in table  [ tab - slt ] .",
    "a large aperture observation is required , which covers the entire [ oi ] 6300   emission region , to derive the h@xmath0o production rate .",
    "the calculations presented in table  [ tab - slt ] suggest that by using large aperture slit the derived water production rate is closer to the actual production rate of h@xmath0o .",
    "hence , to derive the water production rate using [ oi ] 6300  , the slit dimension which covers a projected distance more than the scale length of h@xmath0o should be used .",
    "the density of the species produced in the inner coma ( radial distances less than 10@xmath23 km ) is mainly controlled by photochemical reactions . above these distances",
    "the transport of species starts becoming significant in determining the number density of the calculated species .",
    "our model calculations are based on photochemical equilibrium condition and is for a collisional coma .",
    "hence , model results presented at distances beyond 5 @xmath6 10@xmath23 km are not as reliable as the values in the inner coma . moreover , above these radial distances the chemical lifetimes of neutral species are significantly altered by the solar wind interaction through charge exchange and impact ionization processes .",
    "also , we could not incorporate altitude distribution of dust density in our model calculations which can affect the calculated optical depth .",
    "since our model is time independent and one dimensional it is difficult to explain the asymmetry in the observed [ oi ] 6300   emission intensity over the cometary coma . for determining the spectral width of green and red - doublet lines",
    "elaborated calculations are required along with laboratory measured photodissociation cross sections .",
    "we have recently developed a coupled chemistry - emission model for the forbidden visible emissions 5577 and 6300   of atomic oxygen in comet c/1996 b2 hyakutake  @xcite . in the present paper we applied our model to a high ( @xmath530 times more than on hyakutake ) gas production rate comet c/1995 o1 hale - bopp  in which these prompt emissions are observed in 1997 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main results of our model calculations on comet hale - bopp are summarized as follows .    1 .   below cometocentric distance of 10@xmath2 km , photodissociation of co@xmath0",
    "is the major production mechanism of o(@xmath1s ) .",
    "between 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 km , the contributions from the photodissociation of co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o are nearly equal . above 2 @xmath6",
    "10@xmath3 km several other processes are also significant to the o(@xmath1s ) production .",
    "2 .   mainly the solar photons in 9551165   wavelength band contribute to the production of o(@xmath1s ) in photodissociation of co@xmath0 .",
    "this is because the yield of o(@xmath1s ) in co@xmath0 photodissociation reaches a maximum in this wavelength region .",
    "3 .   since the cross section of photodissociation of co@xmath0 for the production of o(@xmath1s ) is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of h@xmath0o , even a small amount ( few percent relative abundance ) of co@xmath0 can make it an important source of the o(@xmath1s ) .",
    "4 .   quenching by h@xmath0o is the main loss mechanism for o(@xmath1s ) at radial distances below 300 km ; above 10@xmath2 km radiative decay via 5577    emission is the dominant destruction mechanism .",
    "5 .   inside 10@xmath23 km , the main production mechanism of o(@xmath1d ) is photodissociation of h@xmath0o ; but , in the innermost part of the coma ( @xmath21100 km ) the photodissociation of co@xmath0 is also a significant source .",
    "6 .   for photodissociation of h@xmath0o , the peak o(@xmath1d )",
    "production occurs via h ly-@xmath15 ( 1216  ) , 11651375   and 13751575   wavelength bands at cometocentric distances of 1000 , 200 , and 50 km , respectively .",
    "solar photons at all other wavelengths produce o(@xmath1d ) with one or more orders of magnitude smaller efficiency .",
    "7 .   below 100 km , solar photons in the wavelength band 13751585",
    "  mainly produce o(@xmath1d ) by photodissociation of co@xmath0 . the contribution from other wavelength bands is significant above cometocentric distances of 200 km .",
    ".   the major destruction mechanism of o(@xmath1d ) up to 3000 km cometocentric distance is quenching by h@xmath0o ; above 5000 km radiative decay takes over . 9",
    ".   in comet hale - bopp  the o(@xmath1d ) density peaks occurs between 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 km , while for o(@xmath1s ) the peak is around 5001000 km .",
    "the radiative efficiency of o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) atoms in comet hale - bopp  are unity above 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 km , respectively . in comet",
    "hyakutake  these distances are 10@xmath24 and 10@xmath2 km , respectively .",
    "the model calculated green to red - doublet emission intensity ratio is consistent with the observation of @xcite .",
    "collisional quenching can change the g / r ratio by an order of magnitude , whereas doubling the relative abundance of co@xmath0 increases its value by maximum of 30% .",
    "to accurately measure the h@xmath0o production rate in cometary coma , a slit dimension which covers a projected distance more than the scale length of h@xmath0o is preferred to cover the entire [ oi ] 6300   emission region . 14 .",
    "the model calculated [ oi ] 6300   emission intensity profile as a function of projected distance is in agreement with the observation of @xcite .",
    "the model calculated surface brightness averaged over a 4@xmath14 circular aperture field of view is higher by a factor of 1.5 to 2 compared to the observation .",
    "the calculated mean excess velocity of o(@xmath1d ) and o(@xmath1s ) atoms in the region of unity radiative efficiency is @xmath51.6 and @xmath52 km s@xmath9 , respectively , which is consistent with the range of velocities observed by @xcite in several comets .",
    "16 . based on our model calculations for comets",
    "hyakutake  and hale - bopp , we conclude that [ oi ] 6300   emission is mainly controlled by the photodissociation of h@xmath0o , while the [ oi ] 5577   emission line is contributed by both h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 .",
    "since o(@xmath1s ) production is associated with different molecules , whereas the o(@xmath1d ) production is mainly from h@xmath0o , the width of the green line will be higher than that of the red - doublet lines .",

    "<S> we have recently developed a coupled chemistry - emission model for the green ( 5577  ) and red - doublet ( 6300 , 6364  ) emissions of atomic oxygen on comet c/1996 b2 hyakutake . in the present work we applied our model to comet c/1995 o1 hale - bopp , which had an order of magnitude higher h@xmath0o production rate than comet hyakutake , to evaluate the photochemistry associated with the production and loss of o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) atoms and emission processes of green and red - doublet lines . </S>",
    "<S> we present the wavelength - dependent photo - attenuation rates for different photodissociation processes forming o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated radiative efficiency profiles of o(@xmath1s ) and o(@xmath1d ) atoms show that in comet hale - bopp  the green and red - doublet emissions are emitted mostly above radial distances of 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 km , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the model calculated [ oi ] 6300   emission surface brightness and average intensity over the fabry - prot spectrometer field of view are consistent with the observation of @xcite , while the intensity ratio of green to red - doublet emission is in agreement with the observation of @xcite . in comet </S>",
    "<S> hale - bopp , for cometocentric distances less than 10@xmath4 km , the intensity of [ oi ] 6300   line is mainly governed by photodissociation of h@xmath0o . beyond 10@xmath4 km , o(@xmath1d ) </S>",
    "<S> production is dominated by photodissociation of the water photochemical daughter product oh . whereas the [ oi ] 5577   emission line is controlled by photodissociation of both h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated mean excess energy in various photodissociation processes show that the photodissociation of co@xmath0 can produce o(@xmath1s ) atoms with higher excess velocity compared to the photodissociation of h@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our model calculations suggest that involvement of multiple sources in the formation of o(@xmath1s ) could be a reason for the larger width of green line than that of red - doublet emission lines observed in several comets . </S>"
