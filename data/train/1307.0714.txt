    "muon tomography is a technique employing the scattering of secondary cosmic muons inside a material , to reconstruct a 3d image as close as possible to the true localization of the objects inside the volume to be inspected . due to the dependence of the scattering angle on the atomic number @xmath0 of the material",
    ", this technique is particularly promising to search for the presence of high-@xmath0 materials inside large volumes - such as containers - even in presence of additional , low- and medium-@xmath0 , objects .",
    "+ to reach a good precision in the reconstruction of the tomographic image a good tracking muon detector is required , able to reconstruct on a event - by - event basis the track of the muon before and after traversing the volume , even in presence of multiple hits generated by the structure itself ( mechanical structure , empty container ,  ) or by the surrounding materials ( roof , buildings , soil ,  ) .",
    "spatial and angular resolutions are then mandatory in this respect , to provide a good description of the incoming and outgoing muon tracks . such performances may be achieved with several detection technologies , some of which have inherent good spatial resolution ( for instance multiwire gas detectors ) whereas others with worse intrinsic resolution ( such as segmented scintillator strips ) may reach good results depending on the number of detection planes and relative distance between them . on the other side , imaging algorithms of good quality and able to produce results in a small cpu time are an essential tool for the reconstruction of tomographic images .",
    "relatively short computing times , few minutes at most , are infact required at the inspection site , in order to follow the real container flux without significantly interfering with the usual harbour activities .",
    "a large effort is at present pursued by the different groups working in the field to set up appropriate software tools for such task , which involve not only a proper reconstruction , in nearly real - time , of the image , but also good rendering techniques to provide the user with an easy - to - interpret tomographic image .",
    "+ in the framework of a new project aiming at the construction of a real scale prototype of scanning muon detector for containers , an important part of our efforts has been concentrated on testing both traditional and new numerical techniques devoted to this task .",
    "+ in the present paper we report a comparison of several methods which , starting from raw data , produce a tomographic image of the objects contained in a large volume .",
    "data for such comparison were provided by detailed geant4 simulations incorporating the knowledge of the mechanical structure of the detector and of the container under inspection and the physical interactions of the muons ( with realistic energy and angular distributions ) with all materials .",
    "in addition to the simplest method , based on the reconstruction of the point - of - closest - approach , also methods based on autocorrelation analysis , clustering and log - likelihood algorithms have been tested under different scenarios .",
    "+ section [ detectorsection ] reports a brief description of the detector prototype under construction , while section [ algorithmsection ] discusses the main ingredients of all such methods .",
    "section [ resultssection ] reports the application of these algorithms to different sets of simulated data . finally",
    ", section [ summarysection ] is devoted to a discussion of the main aspects which could be improved in the future , in order to arrive to a real - time tomographic analysis for such detector .",
    "the muon portal project @xcite is a prototype of a dedicated particle detector for the inspection of harbour containers through the technique of muon tomography .",
    "the experimental setup is based on four xy detector planes , each providing the x and y position measurements , two placed below and two above the volume to be inspected .",
    "the size of each plane is optimized to fit that of a real teu ( twenty - foot equivalent units ) container , namely 5.9 m @xmath1 2.4 m @xmath1 2.4 m. + to favour the detector assembly and its maintenance , each plane is divided into 6 modules of size 1 m @xmath1 3 m arranged to cover the above specified detector area with minimal dead surfaces .",
    "each module is hosted inside a dedicated casing providing the mechanical support for the detector planes .",
    "the mechanical structure is designed to minimize the amount of material traversed by the cosmic ray muons .",
    "a dummy mechanical structure is also being designed to be inserted between the intermediate detector planes to emulate a real container volume .",
    "+ each module is segmented into 100 strips of extruded plastic scintillators ( 1 @xmath1 1 @xmath1 300 @xmath2 ) with two embedded wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fibres to collect the light produced inside the scintillator bars .",
    "each fiber is coupled at one end to silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) , designed ad - hoc for the project to maximize the light yield with reasonable cost requirements . + more details concerning the detector geometry , electronic readout and channel reduction mechanism can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ the expected detector acceptance @xmath3 to a flux of cosmic ray muons has been evaluated from detailed detector simulations , yielding @xmath3=10 m@xmath4sr , corresponding to a number of expected events of @xmath52@xmath110@xmath6 for a scanning time of @xmath7t=5 minutes and a standard cosmic ray flux @xmath8= 1 m@xmath9s@xmath10 integrated over the solid angle .",
    "+ the angular accuracy for muon track reconstruction has been found of the order of 0.25@xmath11 from toy simulations in which only the impact of the position resolution is considered .",
    "it increases at @xmath50.5@xmath11 in detailed geant4 simulations including also multiple scattering effects .",
    "+ the precision on the determination of the scattering data , scattering angle and lateral displacement , which are relevant for tomography imaging studies , needs to be estimated too .",
    "the analysis yields a scattering angle uncertainty of @xmath50.7@xmath11 and a lateral displacement uncertainty of the order of 2 cm .",
    "this imposes a limit on the minimum size of the threat objects that can be identified with reasonable accuracy inside the container volume and within reasonable scanning times , typically not smaller than 5 cm .",
    "in this section we briefly report details on the statistical algorithms adopted for tomographic image reconstruction .",
    "they have been developed in c++ using links to geant4 @xcite and root @xcite frameworks for detector geometry building and navigation and mathematical routines .",
    "the simplest algorithm in the field is the _ point of closest approach _ ( poca ) which makes the simplified assumption that the muon scattering occurs in a single - point .",
    "it therefore searches for the geometrical point of closest approach @xmath12=@xmath13 between the incoming @xmath14 and outcoming @xmath15 reconstructed track directions with respect to the inspected volume ( see sketch in figure [ pocasketchfig ] ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are two points on the incoming and outgoing tracks , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "such method is of easy implementation and provides fast results , useful as first - order approximation to the problem or as a starting approximation for more detailed algorithms .",
    "however , it neglects the multiple scatterings throught the volume material and therefore has the drawback of providing poor - resolution images , it is quite sensitive to the presence of shield materials located above or below the potential threat and can not localize very well materials at the volume borders .",
    "this motivates the implementation of the log - likelihood algorithm discussed below , which is based on more realistic physical and statistical assumptions and allows to face the problems encountered with the poca algorithm .",
    "it is also desirable to have additional `` grid - free '' statistical methods for tomography analysis , which do not require to assume a predefined grid dividing the inspected volume into three - dimensional voxels .",
    "we explored in next paragraphs two alternative methods , based on the poca observable : the two - points autocorrelation analysis and density - based clustering algorithms .",
    "the two - point autocorrelation function , hereafter denoted _ 2pt - acf _ for brevity , is one of the main statistics generally used to describe the distribution of galaxies and to search for localized excess of data observations at certain scales in a volume with respect to a homogeneous random distribution .",
    "it is therefore well suited also for the problem of tomography imaging where we need to search for a density excess of poca observations inside the container with respect to a normal situation , for instance an empty container .",
    "+ following peebles @xcite the 2pt - acf @xmath25 defines the probability @xmath26 to find simultaneously two objects at a distance @xmath27 from each other within two volume elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 in a data sample with event density @xmath30 : @xmath31dv_{1}dv_{2}\\ ] ] a positive correlation ( @xmath320 ) at distance @xmath27 indicate clustering at such scale , anticorrelation ( @xmath330 ) indicate that the objects tend to avoid each other , while @xmath340 is relative to an homogeneous distribution without significative clusters . + for practical purposes the _ 2pt - acf _ can be computed from a sample of objects counting the pairs of observations at different separations @xmath27 .",
    "four estimators are generally used in literature : peebles - hauser @xmath35 @xcite , davis - peebles @xmath36 @xcite , hamilton @xmath37 @xcite and landy - szalay @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "they require to calculate the number of pairs @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 at distance @xmath27 respectively present in the data set ( data - data ) , in a random data set ( random - random ) and in the data - random set ( data - random ) : @xmath42^{2}}-1\\\\\\hat{\\xi}_{ls}(r)&= & 1+\\frac{n_{rr}}{n_{dd}}\\frac{dd(r)}{rr(r)}-2\\frac{n_{rr}}{n_{dr}}\\frac{dr(r)}{rr(r)}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 , @xmath44 total number of observations present in the data and random data sets and where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the total number of corresponding pairs in the data - data , random - random , data - random catalogues .",
    "such estimators take into account the edge effect due to the fact that it is not always possible to fit in complete spheres of radius @xmath27 at every position within a survey volume , for example at the container borders .",
    "+ the above estimators define spatial correlation only . to seach for both spatial and angular correlations we introduced a weight @xmath48 ( @xmath49=2 ) for each observation pair @xmath50 with scattering angles ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) and computed a weighted correlation estimator @xmath53 .",
    "high - z materials are imaged with the poca method as regions of higher densities of unspecified shape with respect to the background .",
    "it is therefore a natural choice to employ density - based clustering methods in the tomography reconstruction .",
    "they connect data points within a certain distance threshold @xmath54 , satisfying a density criterion defined as the minimum number of objects @xmath55 within @xmath54 .",
    "a cluster of arbitrary shape , in contrast to other clustering methods , is in this way defined by all density - connected objects plus all objects within the distance range .",
    "+ the most popular clustering algorithms is dbscan @xcite .",
    "it requires @xmath54 and @xmath55 as input parameters and it is based on the following steps :    1 .",
    "choose an arbitrary unvisited data point as starting point ; 2 .   find the neighborhood of this point , e.g. all points within the radius @xmath54 . if more than @xmath55 neighborhoods are found around this point then a cluster is started and the point marked as visited , otherwise the point is labelled as noise ; 3 .   if a point is found to be a part of the cluster then its @xmath54 neighborhood is also the part of the cluster and the above procedure from step 2 is repeated for all @xmath54 neighborhood points .",
    "this is repeated until all points in the cluster are determined .",
    "a new unvisited point is retrieved and processed , leading to the discovery of a further cluster or noise .",
    "this process continues until all points are marked as visited .",
    "several clustering algorithms were tested , including dbscan .",
    "the friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite , hereafter denoted as fof , has been found to provide the best results .",
    "the fof is a percolation algorithm normally used to identify dark matter halos from @xmath56-body simulations .",
    "it defines uniquely groups that contain all the particles separated by a distance smaller than a given linking length @xmath57 .",
    "once the linking length is defined , the algorithm identifies all pairs of particles which have a mutual distance smaller than the linking one .",
    "these pairs are designated friends , and clusters are defined as sets of particles that are connected by one or more of the friendly relations , so that they are friends of friends .",
    "the linking length is related to a parameter @xmath58 that represents the mean interparticle separation in simulations ( related to the mean number density @xmath59 as @xmath60 ) .",
    "another parameter in fof algorithm is the minimum number of particles @xmath55 , in a cluster .",
    "the aim is to reject spurious clusters , that is groups of friends who do not form persistent objects in the simulation . choosing @xmath55 sufficiently large allows to eliminate spurious clusters .",
    "in fact it is much more likely that a spurious cluster ( noise ) involves a small number of points and not viceversa .",
    "+      a better statistical treatment of the scattering processes can be done using a log - likelihood approach .",
    "it assumes the volume to be imaged divided into @xmath61 three - dimensional voxels or pixels of size @xmath62 . following the well known rossi s formula , describing the variance of the scattering angle of a particle of momentum @xmath63",

    "such joint distribution for a given scattering layer is with good approximation2% of the data can not be well described by the single gaussian assumption .",
    "a gaussian mixture is often used to reproduce the tails . ]",
    "modelled with a bivariate gaussian with covariance matrix @xmath73 given by : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the measurement error matrix , @xmath76 is the scattering covariance matrix through the @xmath68 voxel and @xmath77 is the ratio between the muon momentum @xmath78 and the reference momentum @xmath63 .",
    "+ the log - likelihood @xmath79 of a data sample of @xmath56 muon events is therefore given by : @xmath80 @xmath81 the scattering densities @xmath67 are estimated by maximizing the above log - likelihood .",
    "traditional algorithms , such as those based on newton - raphson optimization , are limited by the large number of parameters to be determined , i.e. @xmath55@xmath110@xmath82 for voxels of size 10 cm , and by considerable computation and storage required to compute the hessian matrix .",
    "schultz et al @xcite provided a closed form solution to the problem in the em formulation , leading to the following iterative estimation for @xmath67 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of events traversing voxel @xmath68 .",
    "a formula to compute @xmath76 is also available in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will therefore denote this method as _ em - ml _ for brevity .",
    "+ the algorithm requires the following stages :    * init 1 .   reconstruct the scattering data ( @xmath70 , @xmath71)@xmath85 for each event ; 2 .   compute the weight matrices @xmath76 for each event @xmath72 on the basis of the muon path length through the @xmath68 voxel .",
    "the latter can be estimated assuming a straight line connecting entrance and exit points from the inspected volume , eventually passing from the poca point , if this is available or trustable .",

    "iterate formula ( [ emiterationformula ] ) until convergence or early stopping ;    it is well known that with iterative algorithms the image reconstruction can be deteriorated as the iteration proceeds .",
    "an early stopping criterion is therefore often used .",
    "here we decided to stop the iterative procedure when the average relative @xmath67 variation drops below a prespecified threshold @xmath87 , namely : @xmath88 where we assumed @xmath87=1% and we required the criterion to be fulfilled during a given number of consecutive iterations ( i.e. 5 ) .",
