    "the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanical systems for long times , of the order of the heisenberg time , is well understood on the single particle level , see @xcite . at short times , however , spectral correlations are only given by few short system specific orbits which yield non universal results @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question whether a limit of large particle numbers , which leads to an exponentially growing number of short orbits , might bring on its own kind of universality . to address this question we introduced the notion of a dual operator for kicked systems with nearest neighbor interaction , see @xcite , which allows one to calculate traces of short time evolution operators for arbitrary particle numbers . while the dimension of evolution operators @xmath2 grows exponentially with the particle number @xmath0 the dimension of the dual operator @xmath3 depends only ( exponentially ) on the number of time steps @xmath1",
    "the kicked system evolves .",
    "in @xcite we used a kicked ising chain ( kic ) to study the spectrum of @xmath3 . as it turned out",
    "it is generically non - unitary and its structure highly depends on the properties of the considered parameter regime , ranging from integrable to chaotic dynamics .",
    "here , we use @xmath3 to determine , for large particle numbers , the asymptotic behavior of the smooth part of the spectral density and the form factor of said kic . in this limit",
    "we only need to calculate the eigenvalues of the finite dimensional dual operator and not of the infinite dimensional @xmath2 .",
    "additional simplifications stem from non - unitarity as for large @xmath0 we can restrict ourselves to the largest eigenvalues of @xmath3 .    the outline of the paper is as follows : at first , in section [ sec : model ] , we give a brief overview over the model and the main results from @xcite . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we use the dual operator to determine the spectral density .",
    "the spectral form factor both for short and long times @xmath1 is covered in section [ section4 ] and the conclusion is given in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the kicked ising chain model ( kic ) , as used in @xcite , is a one dimensional periodic chain of @xmath0 spin-@xmath4 particles .",
    "its time evolution in term of unit time steps can be described by the floquet operator @xmath5 whose separate parts correspond to the ising part coupling nearest neighbor spins @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a kicking part which acts locally on every spin , @xmath8 herein the magnetic field @xmath9 can be restricted to the @xmath10 plane without loss of generality and @xmath11 are the pauli matrices for spin @xmath12 .",

    "the relevant range for the parameters @xmath14 is @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the different regimes of the kic can be distinguished by the spectral statistics of @xmath2 .",
    "for instance @xmath16 leads to a magnetic field parallel to the coupling and is thus an integrable regime . on the other hand , also an orthogonal field ( @xmath17 ) leads to integrable dynamics , while chaos can be found in between these limiting cases .    traces of the transfer matrix , @xmath18 can be understood as a partition function @xmath19 of a classical two dimensional ising model with complex parameters and periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "the summation covers only classical states of either spin up @xmath20 or down @xmath21 on each site .",
    "the new parameters in terms of the original ones are given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "in the same fashion as we expanded the quantum mechanical system onto the two dimensional model we can contract it again , but we are free to choose either particle or time direction .",
    "contraction along the former direction leads to the dual transfer operator @xmath24 where the dual parameters are determined by ( [ eq : khhparam ] ) if one exchanges @xmath25 and @xmath26 , _",
    "@xmath27 up to the correction factor @xmath28 this dual matrix is still of the same form as @xmath2 in the original kic , however the parameters of the model are complex making @xmath3 generically non - unitary .",
    "traces of both transfer matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 describe the same classical partition and thus we find the trace duality @xmath31 the crucial difference between both matrices is their dimension , in the original kic it was @xmath32 but in the dual picture the role of the particle number is taken by the time steps and the dimension is @xmath33 . especially in the case of short propagation times this allows one to consider arbitrarily large particle numbers . for further detail on the spectrum of @xmath3 and the mapping mechanism described above we refer to @xcite .",
    "as a first application we look at the density of states , first for the kicked system and later on also in the limit of continuous dynamics . in the discrete case we approximate the spectral density by only the largest dual eigenvalues and find sharp transitions between the asymptotic densities for @xmath34 when varying the system parameters , see section [ spdekic ] .",
    "subsequently we look at the limit of small parameters , section [ smapar ] , which already approximates the time continuous limit . in the continuous case , section [ cont ] , we utilize the duality relation to reproduce the gaussian behavior of the density .",
    "the spectrum of the quantum evolution operator @xmath2 comprises @xmath35 unitary eigenvalues @xmath36 with quasi - energies @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding spectral density can be written as a fourier series of traces of the evolution operator , @xmath38 we are interested in the non - constant term on the right hand side of ( [ density_basic ] ) representing the oscillating part @xmath39 of the density . for large @xmath0",
    "the traces can be approximated by powers of the eigenvalues with the largest magnitude of the dual operator , @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the eigenvalues of @xmath3 ordered such that they decrease in magnitude .",

    "clearly , in the large @xmath0 limit @xmath46 dominates the rest of the eigenvalues and @xmath47 determines the asymptotic period of the @xmath48 oscillations . since the value of @xmath47 depends on the parameters of the kic , the asymptotic form of @xmath48 undergoes abrupt transitions under the change of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . to illustrate this we color code the largest components for some parameter regime in figure [ fig : hfmtransit1 ]",
    "previously , similar transitions in the oscillatory behavior of @xmath51 were observed in the two - dimensional kic @xcite .",

    "particularly , in the near integrable regime , a good approximation is obtained by just a few leading modes , see figure  [ fig : approximatedfourier1 ] .",
    "this is reflected in a very pronounced oscillating structure of @xmath48 . in the chaotic regime",

    "below we show that the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) can also be used to evaluate the eigenvalue density of the rescaled hamiltonian @xmath88 in the limit of large @xmath0 . the main idea here is to split the continues time evolution into small steps and approximate @xmath89 by the propagator of the kic model .",

    "we give approximations for the spectral form factor , considering separately the integrable and the chaotic case in sections [ sec : longt ] and [ sec : longtchaos ] .",

    "each sector has orthogonal symmetry , and as @xmath2 is unitary , this implies spectral statistics comparable to the circular orthogonal matrix ensembles ( coe ) .",
    "indeed , in the kic such universal spectral correlations can be observed in the chaotic parameter regime , see @xcite for details .",
    "furthermore , in the limit all subspectra can be considered as independent .",

    "two ) special sectors can be ignored .      in @xcite pineda and prosen studied the spectral form factor numerically also at short times for up to 20 particles .",
    "they found a behavior not consistent with rmt .    in this context",
    "we can apply the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) to analytically compute the spectral form factor for arbitrary numbers of particles in the short time regime . for @xmath129 ,",

    "this matrix has the important benefit that it allows statements about the eigenvalue density of the floquet operator and the spectral form factor in the limit of many particles and small times , as the dimension of this dual matrix is small in this case . in our model",
    "it turned out that @xmath3 is non - unitary and features a rich structure , which depends on the parameter regime considered .",
    "furthermore , we exploited the non - unitarity for large @xmath0 asymptotics as in those cases only the largest eigenvalues of @xmath3 play a significant role . following this line of reasoning we gave approximations to the smoothed density of states where we found abrupt transitions in the dominant oscillation frequency .",
    "we also investigated the limit of small system parameters @xmath213 which allowed us to study properties of time continuous spin chains . here",
    ", the trace duality provides an easy to use mechanism to derive the density profile for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .    for the form factor we can , due to the reduced dimensionality of @xmath3 , give explicit expressions for short times @xmath214 but arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "this shines some light on previously raised questions regarding non rmt behavior of the form factor in this limit , see @xcite . in the integrable regime",
    "exact expressions are , in principle , known as the model can be mapped on a solvable classical two dimensional ising model or free fermions .",
    "still , we can use the duality relation to easily obtain asymptotic and approximate results based on the largest eigenvalues . in this case",
    "the result not only depends on the eigenvalues magnitude , but also on the degeneracy which changes abruptly when varying the system parameters . for the chaotic case the known linear growth in time for the form factor",
    "was derived building on periodic orbit correlations , but it can also be understood from the structural decomposition of @xmath3 into @xmath1 sectors .",
    "it would be of great interest to understand the asymptotic behavior of the spectral form factor in the chaotic regime also for a large but finite @xmath1 when @xmath164 . in this regime",
    "the eigenvalues of the unitary kic propagator obey the universal coe distribution on the scales of mean level spacing .",
    "a natural and intriguing question arises with respect to the eigenvalues of the dual propagator : whether they exhibit universal behavior which could be described by a non - unitary random matrix ensemble ?",
    "this in turn would imply some kind of `` universality '' in the spectral correlations at scales much larger than conventional mean level spacing .    as a closing remark ,",
    "let us point out that the duality relation remains valid also in the case when kick and/or coupling parameters are chosen randomly .",
    "in such a case this relation might proof a useful tool to study _",
    "e.g. _  many body localization .",
    "another possible area of application are hamiltonian systems with continues time dynamics .",
    "splitting the propagation into sufficiently small time steps the dynamics can be approximated by kicks in discrete time .",
    "this opens a road to apply the duality relation to short time propagators of hamiltonian systems as well .",
