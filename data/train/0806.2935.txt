    "the study of interfaces has a long and interesting history . in 1894 van der waals @xcite proposed an interface theory , which leads to a flat interface with a density profile in the direction of gravity .",
    "this result is sometimes referred to as the _ intrinsic interface_. already von schmoluchowski @xcite realized that the thermal motion of the molecules induces height fluctuations in the interface .",
    "these motions have been called _ capillary waves _ , since they derive from an interplay of gravity and surface tension , like capillary rise .",
    "the fluctuations were first treated theoretically and experimentally by mandelstam @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that the interface width diverges due to the short wavelength capillary waves .",
    "this fact was rediscovered by buff , lovett and stillinger @xcite fifty years later , after which it obtained a prominent place in the discussion of interfaces .",
    "weeks @xcite later pointed out that the notion of capillary waves only applies to wave lengths larger than the fluid correlation length , which is of the order of the interparticle distance .",
    "the experimental study of interfaces was undertaken by raman @xcite and vrij @xcite with light scattering and starting with braslau et al .",
    "@xcite by x - ray scattering .",
    "although scattering on interfaces is most valuable , it always yields _ global _ information on the fluctuations , while a photographic inspection gives _ local _ information .",
    "however , the wave lengths and heights involved in the capillary waves of molecular fluids are way out of the reach of detection by photographic methods .",
    "the visual inspection of capillary waves initially remained restricted to computer simulations of interfaces in molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the field obtained another dimension by recent experiments of aarts et al .",
    "@xcite in which they obtained pictures of fluctuating colloidal interfaces .",
    "the key is that , by lowering the surface tension to the @xmath0 range , the characteristic length and time scale of the fluctuations become accessible by confocal microscopy .",
    "this opened up the possibility to follow in detail the motion of the height of the interface and to do a statistical analysis of its temporal and spatial behavior .",
    "of course the method has its inherent restrictions . just as in ordinary movie recording",
    ", the pixels have a finite distance and the snapshots have to be taken at finite time intervals . for colloidal interfaces this interval can be made much smaller than the intrinsic time scale of the motions .",
    "thus the brownian character of the motion could be demonstrated _ ad oculos_.        in the confocal microscopy a two - dimensional section is inspected perpendicular to the interface and the density profile between the two phases is observed . a schematic picture of the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ picaarts ] . a very precise location of the interface can be obtained by fitting the intensity with a van der waals - like profile : @xmath1/c)$ ] , where @xmath2 is the direction perpendicular to the interface and @xmath3 a coordinate along the interface . in the upper phase",
    "the density approaches a value corresponding to @xmath4 and in the lower phase to @xmath5 , while @xmath6 measures the intrinsic width of the interface .",
    "thus at every snapshot a function @xmath7 follows and the sequence of snapshots gives the function @xmath8 . this is a practical separation of the particle motions , which lead at short scales to the _ intrinsic interface _ and the particle motions which drive the long wavelength _",
    "capillary waves_. one might think that , if the time interval of the snapshots is sufficiently small with respect to the characteristic time scale of variation in @xmath8 , one can analyze @xmath8 as a continuous function of the time , like a movie gives the impression of a continuous motions , while it is a succession of snapshots . in a previous short report @xcite on these experiments",
    "we have pointed out that the statistics remains dependent on the time interval , due to the brownian character of the motion .",
    "we have performed confocal microscopy measurements on phase separated colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "the colloids are 69 nm radius fluorescently - labeled polymethylmetacrylate particles , suspended in cis / trans decalin , with polystyrene ( estimated radius of gyration = 42 nm @xcite ) added as depletant polymer .",
    "due to a depletion induced attraction these mixtures phase separate at sufficiently high colloid and polymer volume fractions and a proper colloid to polymer aspect ratio into a colloid - rich / polymer - poor ( colloidal liquid ) and a colloid - poor / polymer - rich ( colloidal gas ) phase @xcite . here",
    "the polymer concentration acts as an inverse temperature . by diluting several phase separating samples with its solvent decalin , the phase diagram was constructed . with a nikon e400 microscope equipped with a nikon c1 confocal scanhead , series of 10 000 snapshots of the interface",
    "were recorded at constant intervals @xmath9 of 0.45 s and 0.50 s of two statepoints to be denoted as ii and iv .",
    "the pixels are separated by a distance @xmath10 and a single scan takes approximately 0.25 s to complete .    the set - up of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start out by discussing the spatial behavior of the data of a single time frame , which requires only equilibrium statistics .",
    "the correlation functions and the statistics of hills and valleys in the interface are determined and compared to the theory .",
    "then we identify the set of interface modes via the fourier decomposition @xmath11 the modes are overdamped in the relevant regime and follow from the macroscopic interface - dynamics .",
    "the motion obeys not only the macroscopic equations but is also influenced by noise .",
    "we introduce thermal noise through the langevin equation and calculate the essential height - height correlation function @xmath12 . via the equivalent fokker - planck equation the probabilities on sequences ( `` histories '' ) of snapshots",
    "are determined .",
    "the analysis of the distributions of `` hills '' and `` valleys '' in the time domain with respect to a level @xmath13 is similar to the spatial behavior .",
    "a special concern is the dependence of the residence time and the waiting time on the used time - interval .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion of the main results .",
    "the function @xmath14 provides a mathematical division between the two coexisting phases which form the interface .",
    "the interface is of the solid - on - solid type since so - called overhangs , well - known in lattice theory , are excluded by construction , as to every value of the horizontal coordinate @xmath15 and time @xmath16 one unique height @xmath14 is associated .",
    "the basic function is the height - height correlation function . due to translational invariance the modes @xmath17",
    "are independent and thus the correlation function in space has the fourier decomposition @xmath18 the brackets denote equilibrium averages and @xmath19 is the amplitude of the @xmath17-th mode .",

    "the first term gives the gravitational potential energy and the second term the increase of the interfacial energy due to curvature .",
    "expressed in terms of the amplitudes @xmath19 it reads @xmath24\\ ,     since ( [ c5 ] ) is quadratic in the amplitudes @xmath19 , it implies a gaussian distribution for the @xmath19 @xmath25^{1/ 2}},\\ ] ] with the average @xmath26        with the distribution ( [ c6 ] ) of the @xmath19 , we can calculate the distribution of the heights @xmath13 , which becomes also a gaussian @xmath27^{1/ 2}},\\ ] ] with the mean square height @xmath28 given by @xmath29 @xmath30 is the capillary length defined as @xmath31 the integral has been given an upper bound @xmath32 with @xmath33 the diameter of the particles and a lower bound @xmath34 due to the finite size of the interface .",
    "the lower bound can be set equal to 0 for all practical purposes , but the upper bound is essential for the convergence of the integral .",
    "cutting off the capillary waves at the short - wavelength side is the poor man s way to handle the otherwise diverging interface width @xmath28 .",
    "there are two options to determine @xmath28 .",
    "the first follows from a fit to @xmath35 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ heights ] .",
    "the second is a direct evaluation of @xmath28 from the recorded data .",
    "the latter always gives a 1 - 3 % larger value , which we attribute to optical artifacts due to confocal slicing .",
    "so we are inclined to prefer the former value which amounts to @xmath36 for statepoint ii and 0.336 @xmath37 for statepoint iv",
    ". then equation ( [ c9 ] ) can be used to estimate the upper cut - off . on the basis of a determination of @xmath22 ( see below )",
    "one finds values around @xmath38 , but this value is rather sensitive to small variations in @xmath22 : a variation of @xmath22 by 10 - 15% results in a shift in @xmath39 by a factor 2 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath40 is of course also measurable . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the integral ( [ c0 ] ) ; here we give the result with the cut - off sent to @xmath41 @xmath42 the divergence for @xmath43 of the modified bessel function @xmath44 corresponds to the divergence of the interface width without a cut - off .",
    "a fit of the correlation function to the besselfunction ( with a slight modification due to the cut - off ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ gxfits ] .",
    "apart from a few initial points the function fits quite well .",

    "the values for @xmath22 turn out to be @xmath47 viz @xmath48 for statepoint ii viz .",

    "the lines are fits to the experimental data.,width=12 ]    fourier transforming the correlation function back to the wavenumber domain should lead to the expression ( [ c7 ] ) as function of @xmath49 .",
    "however , an inverse fourier transform requires accurate data for a large domain and the correlation function is unreliable for large distances ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ gxfits ] ) .",
    "this prevents a direct check of the drumhead hamiltonian .",
    "as the data are stored for all sampled positions we can determine the probability density    @xmath50    which gives the joint probability that the interface at position @xmath51 has the height @xmath52 and subsequently at position @xmath53 the height @xmath54 etc .. a straightforward evaluation of ( [ x1 ] ) proceeds via writing the @xmath55 functions as a fourier integral and then expressing @xmath56 in terms of the amplitudes @xmath19 . as all integrals are over a quadratic form in the exponent the result is a gaussian in the @xmath54 .",

    "the second way uses the expression ( [ x2 ] ) .",
    "then one has to diagonalize the quadratic form in the exponent and the integration over the eigendirections also leads to the right hand side of ( [ x2 ] ) , which shows that ( [ d5 ] ) is correct .    in ( [ x3 ] ) and accordingly in the result ( [ x2 ] ) , we have factored out @xmath28 because we want to use it as a scale for the heights .",

    "so the numerator in ( [ e8 ] ) selects the hills of precisely @xmath63 consecutive values of the height above level @xmath13 .",

    "the average length @xmath91 of a sequence is defined as @xmath92 we also look to sequences _ below _ the height @xmath13 .",
    "they are given by the probability @xmath93 which follows from a similar definition as ( [ e8 ] ) , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 interchanged .",

    "a few remarks on ( [ b1 ] ) are worth making :    * the dispersion relation @xmath122 is in general rather complicated .",
    "the simplification ( [ b2 ] ) derives from the approximation @xmath123 which is very well fulfilled for colloidal interfaces with extremely low surface tension .",

    "the spectrum has a slowest mode with wavelength @xmath30 and decay rate @xmath118 , in contrast to the capillary waves of molecular fluids , where the modes become slower the longer the wavelength .",
    "this mode starts to dominate the behavior of the correlations for long times .",
    "the thermal influences can be incorporated by a fluctuating force @xmath128 on mode @xmath17 in the langevin equation @xcite @xmath129 the first term on the right hand side is the systematic damping force , which by itself would lead to an exponential decay of mode @xmath49 .",

    "this leads to experimental values of @xmath111 , which we plot in the figure at the value @xmath184 .",
    "the curves for a fixed value of @xmath13 are statepoint independent ; the figure shows that this is pretty well the case .     as function of @xmath13 for three time interval for three interval @xmath185 and @xmath186.,width=12 ]    finally we plot in figure [ taus ] the dependence of the @xmath183 s on @xmath13 for three choices of the time interval .",
    "the curves are confusing at first sight , since the values of @xmath187 are about the same for all three choices .",
    "so , if we multiply them with the value of the chosen time interval , in order to convert them from numbers to real times , we get substantial different times .",
    "this indicates that the residence and waiting time depend strongly on the measuring process .",
    "the fact that the smallest chosen time interval leads to the smallest value of the residence and waiting time , naturally poses the question what will happen in the limit of vanishingly small time interval @xmath9 .",
    "theoretically it relies on the behavior of the correlation function @xmath188 in the limit @xmath189 .",
    "we presented in ( [ c14 ] ) the behavior as it follows from capillary wave theory . a linear approach of @xmath23 to 1 implies that @xmath190 increases as the inverse power of the square root of @xmath9 .",
    "then , after multiplying with @xmath9 in order to get their values in real time , the residence and waiting time vanish as the square root of @xmath9 . however , the slope of the linear term in ( [ c14 ] ) depends on a molecular quantity @xmath39 , which indicates that wavelengths matter for which the mesoscopic capillary waves theory is not designed @xcite .",
    "one could argue that for molecular times , the cusp in @xmath150 is rounded off to a parabola ( since it is time reversal invariant ) .",
    "then this parabola would compensate the square root in ( [ f4 ] ) and the residence and waiting time would approach a finite limit .",
    "unfortunately this scenario can not be tested experimentally , given the present limits on the sampling frequency .",
    "however , there is an interesting sampling regime beyond our data , for which the capillary wave theory still holds . in fig .",
    "[ mounnum ] the data go up to the value @xmath191 .",
    "the typical square root decay of the curves for @xmath111 can not be tested with our data .",
    "a microscope , which is faster by a factor 10 , could enter this regime where the typical signature of the brownian character of the fluctuations is most significant .",
    "they give increasingly larger weight to short living hills and valleys , which force the mean values to shrink in a specific way predicted by the presented theory .",
    "the same issue presents itself in the analysis of the data for a single time as function of the sampling distance , but in a less severe way . in the appendix",
    "it is shown that the height - height correlation as function of the distance is a parabola for short distances .",
    "thus a finite value of the sequence length and the recurrence length would follow in the limit of continuous sampling",
    ". however , again we do not reach the regime and the theoretical limiting values are strongly dependent on the cut - off @xmath39 , where the capillary wave theory breaks down .",
    "we plot in fig . [ distribution ] the experimental curves for @xmath115 for a large number of @xmath63 for statepoint iv .",
    "a noteworthy point is that only for rather large values of @xmath63 the decay with @xmath63 ( time ) becomes exponential .     for statepoint iv , for @xmath176 ( filled squares ) , @xmath112 ( circles ) and @xmath177 ( semifilled pentagons ) .",
    "the colours correspond to time intervals @xmath178 0.5 seconds ( black symbols ) , @xmath179 ( red symbols ) and @xmath180 ( green symbols),width=12 ]    the scatter in the data is modest , even for large @xmath63 corresponding to large times @xmath16 .",
    "thus the experiment provides a host of detailed information on the statistics of the fluctuations in a wide time range .",
    "another way of plotting the data is to select one value of @xmath63 and plot @xmath193 as function of @xmath13 .",
    "[ pnplut ] shows the experimental data for statepoint iv for @xmath115 .     as function of @xmath13 for a number of @xmath63 for statepoint iv .",
    "the drawn lines are the theoretical values.,width=12 ]    this way of presenting the data facilitates the comparison with the theory .",
    "the drawn lines are the theoretical values as given by ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "we reiterate that the input in the calculations is a set of @xmath194 experimental values of @xmath150 .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is remarkable for these detailed data .",
    "statepoint ii gives similar results with a slight asymmetry between up and down , of the same type as deviations in the spatial correlation functions , shown in fig .",
    "[ pnplu ] .",
    "the data for @xmath93 have been independently collected .",
    "the symmetry ( [ e6 ] ) is very well obeyed , such that there is no point in showing these data separately .",
    "the above given analysis of the statistics of interface fluctuations naturally falls into two parts , in which the height - height correlation function @xmath168 plays a pivotal role .",
    "the first part concerns the connection between @xmath168 and the state parameters such as @xmath195 and @xmath22 .",
    "the second part is the determination of the multiple correlation - functions @xmath196 from @xmath168 through ( [ d4 ] ) . in the first part",
    "we have used the data for @xmath168 to determine the state parameters . even though the derivation of the structure of @xmath168 in space and in time is quite different , the behavior is remarkably similar if the space and time variables are properly scaled ( see ( [ cx ] ) and ( [ c12 ] ) ) .",
    "the second part has been our main concern .",
    "we used the measured @xmath168 as input , providing all the necessary information on the statistics of the snapshots .",
    "the advantage of splitting the problem into these two parts is that the second part is not confounded by errors in the first .",
    "the only assumption in the theory is the use of the langevin equation for the effect of the thermal ( white ) noise .",
    "the best justification for this procedure is _ a posteriori _ through its consequences . in view of the successful agreement with the experimental results",
    ", the assumption appears to be very well fulfilled .",
    "experimentally the capillary waves are disentangled from the structure of the intrinsic interface .",
    "most amazing is that detailed correlations in capillary waves can be determined with high accuracy .",
    "the statistics of the temporal dependence is generally better than that of the spatial behavior .",
    "we have chosen only a limited set of obtainable correlation functions in order to compare them with the theoretical calculations .",
    "experimentally it is easy to collect data for practically any interesting @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ pnplu ] and fig .",
    "[ distribution ] we show the distribution @xmath115 as function of @xmath63 for the values @xmath197 and 1 .",
    "there is a simplifying aspect in the fact that experimentally only sequences of finite time intervals can be measured .",
    "so one does not know what the interface does in between two snapshots .",
    "but this is precisely the reason why it suffices to calculate the correlation functions defined in section [ sequence ] . here",
    "also one does not specify the evolution in between two snapshots .",
    "for instance , the key quantity @xmath111 for the residence and waiting times , involves the crossing of the level @xmath13 by the interface .",
    "but it does not say that it may cross it only once !",
    "any odd number of crossings is possible . in fig .",
    "[ mounnum ] , where we compare @xmath111 with experiment , large time intervals feature ( corresponding to small @xmath23 ) and in these large time intervals crossings are frequently taking place .",
    "also the hills and valleys of length @xmath63 for which the distribution is given in fig .",
    "[ pnplu ] and fig .",
    "[ pnplut ] , may be interrupted by opposite values in between snapshots .",
    "the charm of the comparison is that both theory and experiment allow these possibilities .    in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to sequences of height measurements at the same time or at the same position . the general result ( [ d4 ] )",
    "shows that one could equally well correlate snapshots at combinations of times and positions and do a similar statistical analysis .",
    "the only point that matters is the height - height correlation @xmath58 between the events @xmath198 and @xmath199 . also one does not need to worry in how much the measurements refer to a single point or to an area of finite size .",
    "these more collective variables are also linear combinations of the basic variables @xmath19 and therefore also gaussian randomly distributed .",
    "then taking the measured correlations between the more general variables as input , leads to exactly the same analysis as given here for point variables .",
