    "it is a remarkable feature of interacting , itinerant fermion systems that at low temperatures @xmath1 they behave in general in much the same way as a noninteracting fermi gas , even though the interaction may be strong .",
    "an extremely successful description of this phenomenon , known as fermi liquid ( fl ) behavior , is provided by the notion of quasiparticles , which was established by landau s phenomenological fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "the key assumption is that , as the interaction is continuously turned on , there exists a 1:1 correspondence between the low energy eigenstates of the interacting system and the single  particle states of the free fermi gas .",
    "therefore , the low  lying interacting states may be described approximately as single ",
    "particle states or quasiparticles , whose decay rate @xmath2 is small compared to their excitation energy @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and which are characterized by the same quantum numbers as the noninteracting states . as a consequence ,",
    "fermi liquids exhibit the same low@xmath1 thermodynamics as a noninteracting fermi system , e.g.  a linear in @xmath1 specific heat @xmath5 and a constant pauli paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "however , the effective mass and other parameters may be renormalized by the interaction , resulting in an enhancement of the specific heat coefficient @xmath7 and the susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "it is at the heart of the quasiparticle picture that at low @xmath1 the pauli exclusion principle substantially reduces the phase space available to quasiparticle scattering .",
    "this blocking mechanism is effective as long as the quasiparticle interaction is _ shortranged in space and time _ , which is usually the case in three dimensions because of screening .",
    "it also implies that the quasiparticle scattering rate vanishes as @xmath8 in the limit @xmath9 , thus providing a microscopic justification for the basic assumption of fl theory and leading to an interaction contribution to the electrical resistivity which behaves as @xmath10 .",
    "obviously , the pauli principle as the origin of fl behavior is very robust , which explains the almost ubiquitous presence of a fl ground state in interacting fermi systems and the broad success of fermi liquid theory .    in this light",
    "it is all the more exciting that in recent years a number of new alloys have been discovered which exhibit striking deviations from this usual behavior .",
    "these systems have in common that a localized , degenerate degree of freedom , the magnetic moment of a magnetic ion , is dynamically coupled to a continuum of conduction electron states . in general , such a coupling generates the kondo effect , characterized by resonant spin flip scattering of electrons at the fermi surface off the local moment .",
    "concomitantly , the conduction electron spin flip rate initially increases logarithmically as the temperature is lowered , passes through a maximum at a characteristic scale , the kondo temperature @xmath11 , and approaches zero as @xmath12 , because the effective local moment becomes screened by the conduction electron spins .",
    "thus , even for many strongly correlated systems of this type a fermi liquid description applies below @xmath11 , with usually a strongly enhanced quasiparticle effective mass , lending the term `` heavy fermion systems '' to these materials .",
    "completely new physics may arise , however , if the quenching of the local moments is inhibited .",
    "two different mechanisms for the appearance of a non  fermi liquid ground state have been put forward :    * proximity of a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) to an antiferromagnetically ordered state @xcite@xcite as a function of a dopant concentration @xmath13 or of pressure . near the qpt",
    "the quantum critical fluctuations become longranged in space and time and can , thus , mediate a longrange quasiparticle interaction , leading to a breakdown of fl theory .",
    "there are indications for this spatially extended mechanism to be realized near the qpt of certain ce based compounds like cecu@xmath14au@xmath15 @xcite , cecu@xmath16si@xmath16 @xcite , and cepd@xmath16si@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "* two  channel kondo effect ( 2ck ) @xcite .",
    "the local magnetic moment is coupled to two exactly degenerate conduction electron channels . because of a frustration effect between the screening of the local moment by the different conduction channels the moment quenching can not be complete , leading to a nonvanishing conduction electron spin scattering rate even at the lowest temperatures and subsequently to a breakdown of fl behavior .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that this mechanism , based on single ",
    "ion dynamics rather than longrange fluctuations , may be realized predominantly in u based materials with cubic symmetry about the magnetic ion , such as y@xmath17u@xmath15pd@xmath18 @xcite or ucu@xmath19pt@xmath15 @xcite , which do not exhibit a qpt .    in both scenarios",
    "the wealth of experimental data showing non  fl behavior at low temperatures is not consistently explained by the present theories .",
    "open questions within the qpt picture include , e.g. , whether the local impurity dynamics competing with the magnetic ordering can play a role , and how the transition from the spin screened heavy fl phase to the magnetically ordered phase occurs alltogether . in the 2ck mechanism , on the other hand ,",
    "impurity interactions could modify the single ion behavior .",
    "exact solution methods as well as numerical simulations have provided important progress in our understanding of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems .",
    "however , their applicability is essentially restricted to problems involving only a single impurity , owing to integrability conditions or limitations in the numerical effort , respectively .",
    "therefore , more generally applicable theoretical techniques are called for .    in the present work we focus on the single  ion dynamics .",
    "we develop a standard field theoretical method , based on an auxiliary particle or slave boson representation , which describes the quantum impurity dynamics in a controlled way and at the same time has the potential of being extended to problems of many impurities on a lattice . as a standard model of strongly correlated electrons",
    "which , depending on its symmetry , exhibits both fl and non  fl behavior , we consider the su(n)@xmath0su(m ) anderson impurity model of a local , @xmath20fold degenerate degree of freedom , coupled to @xmath21 identical conduction bands .    in order to set the stage for the more formal development of the theory , in the following section we will briefly review the striking differences in the phenomenology of the single  channel and the multi ",
    "channel kondo effects . in section 3 the slave boson representation",
    "is introduced , which provides a particularly compact formulation of the su(n)@xmath0su(m ) anderson model .",
    "we also discuss why the presence of fl or non  fl behavior in a given quantum impurity system can already be seen from the singular infrared dynamics of the auxiliary particles .",
    "section 4 contains a critical assessment of earlier approximate slave boson treatments .",
    "this will motivate our conserving slave boson approach ( conserving t  matrix approximation , ctma ) , which is developed in section 5 .",
    "as will be seen , the results produced from this theory are in very good agreement with known exact properties of the model .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 6 . in the appendices we prove a cancellation theorem for non ",
    "ctma diagrams , which justifies the ctma on formal grounds , and derive in detail the self  consistent ctma equations .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss how the single  channel and the two  channel kondo effects may arise in magnetic metals , if the interaction between the local moments can be neglected .",
    "we first discuss the usual magnetic , single  channel kondo effect .",
    "a local moment is generated by an atomic f or d level whose energy @xmath22 lies far below the fermi energy @xmath23 and whose electron occupation number is effectively restricted to @xmath24 by a strong coulomb repulsion @xmath25 between two electrons in the same orbital .",
    "while the angular momentum degeneracy of the level is usually lifted by crystal field splitting , in the absence of a magnetic field a twofold degeneracy of a level occupied by one electron is guaranteed by time reversal symmetry ( kramers doublet ) , corresponding to the spin quantum numbers @xmath26 of the electron .",
    "in addition , there is a hybridization matrix element @xmath27 between the atomic orbital and the conduction electron states .",
    "such a system is described by the single impurity anderson hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the creation operators of a conduction electron with dispersion @xmath31 and of an electron in the local orbital with spin @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the low energy physics of this system is dominated by processes of second order in @xmath27 , by which an electron hybridizes with the conduction band and the impurity level is subsequently filled by another electron , thereby effectively flipping the impurity spin .",
    "thus , in the region of low excitation energies , the anderson hamiltonian ( [ ahamilton ] ) may be mapped onto the s ",
    "d exchange ( or kondo ) model @xcite , the effective coupling between the impurity spin and the conduction electron spin always being antiferromagnetic : @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these models have been studied extensively by means of wilson s renormalization group @xcite , by the bethe ansatz method @xcite and by means of a phenomenological fermi liquid theory @xcite . in this way",
    "the following physical picture has emerged : the model contains a dynamically generated low temperature scale , the kondo temperature , which is expressed in terms of the parameters of the anderson hamiltonian ( [ ahamilton ] ) as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the density of states at the fermi energy and the high energy band cutoff , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 denotes the effective hybridization or @xmath39level broadening and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the degeneracy of the local level and the number of conduction electron channels ( see below ) . in the intermediate temperature regime , @xmath40 ,",
    "resonant spin flip scattering of electrons at the fermi surface off the local degenerate level leads to logarithmic contributions to the magnetic susceptibility , the linear specific heat coefficient and the resistivity ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , and to a breakdown of perturbation theory at @xmath43 .",
    "below @xmath11 a collective many ",
    "body spin singlet state develops in which the impurity spin is screened by the conduction electron spins as lower and lower energy scales are successively approached , leaving the system with a pure potential scattering center .",
    "the spin singlet formation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] a ) and corresponds to a vanishing entropy at @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "it also leads to saturated behavior of physical quantities below @xmath11 , like @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. to fermi liquid behavior .    as an example of possible two  channel kondo systems we discuss the uranium based compounds mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the u@xmath49 ions have nominally a 5f@xmath50 configuration , i.e. an even number of electrons , which does not allow for a kramers degenerate ground state because of integer total spin .",
    "however , in the cubic crystal symmetry of these materials the orbital degeneracy may be not completely lifted , so that there can be an approximate twofold degeneracy of the u@xmath49 ground state , corresponding to two different orientations of the electrical quadrupole moment of the 5f orbital in the lattice ( quadrupolar kondo effect ) @xcite .",
    "this degree of freedom may be flipped by scattering of conduction electrons ( which in the cubic symmetry also have a twofold angular momentum degeneracy ) .",
    "the conduction electron spin is conserved in this scattering process , leaving it as a kramers degenerate scattering channel degree of freedom , which we will label by @xmath51 , @xmath52 . describing the orbital degree of freedom as a pseudospin 1/2 , labelled by the quantum number @xmath53 , @xmath54 , in analogy to the magnetic kondo effect , we arrive at the su(2)@xmath0su(m ) symmetric kondo model , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the local pseudospin operator and @xmath57 the vector of pauli matrices . to keep the naming uniform",
    ", we will refer to the orbital degree of freedom as the ( pseudo)spin or local moment , @xmath58 , in analogy to the magnetic kondo effect , and to the physical electron spin as the channel degree of freedom , @xmath59 . in the multi  channel case , too , the conduction electrons of each channel _ separately _ screen the impurity moment by multiple spin scattering at temperatures below the kondo scale @xmath11 .",
    "however , in this case , the local moment is over  compensated , since the impurity spin can never form a singlet state with both conduction electron channels at the same time in this way , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] b ) . as a consequence of this frustration ,",
    "there is not a unique ground state , leading to a finite residual entropy @xcite at @xmath44 of @xmath60 in the two  channel model . in particular , the precondition of fl theory of a 1:1 correspondence between interacting and non  interacting states is violated . as a consequence ,",
    "characteristic singular temperature dependence @xcite of physical quantities persists for @xmath61 down to @xmath44 : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note , however , that this behavior may be changed by any crystal field splitting of the quadrupolar non  kramers ground state doublet .    in order to apply standard field theoretical methods to the multi ",
    "channel kondo model it is convenient to consider it as the low  energy limiting case of a corresponding anderson model as discussed for the single  channel case . here , in addition , the conservation of the channel degree of freedom has to be guaranteed .",
    "this can be implemented in an elegant way using an auxiliary boson representation to be discussed in the next section .",
    "as discussed above , the local level of a quantum impurity in the limit of infinitely strong local coulomb repulsion @xmath25 between electrons in the same level allows only for at most single electron occupation of the level , @xmath65 .",
    "one should note that for a realistic finite value of @xmath25 the low  energy physics of the model is effectively still confined to the part of the hilbert space without multiple occupancy .",
    "therefore , the model eq .",

    "each fock state @xmath67 of the impurity is assigned a creation operator , which can be envisaged as creating the state out of a vacuum state @xmath68 without any impurity level at all , @xmath69 .",
    "( e.g. , for a single orbital there are four such states , @xmath70 ( empty orbital ) , @xmath71 or @xmath72 ( orbital occupied by a single electron with spin @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( level occupied by two electrons with spin @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) . ) due to the requirements of fermi statistics , the creation operators @xmath76 are fermi ( bose ) operators for the states holding an odd ( even ) number of electrons ( or vice versa ) .",
