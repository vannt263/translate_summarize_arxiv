    "statistical inference methods are a basic component of astronomical research .",
    "nonparametric methods , in particular , make as few as assumptions as possible about the data s underlying distribution , and are thus of particular relevance to scientific discovery in astronomy .",
    "unfortunately these tend to be much more computationally intensive than parametric procedures . in the era of massive and ever - growing astronomical databases , such as the sdss and several others",
    ", astronomical data analysis would seem to have already surpassed the tractable regime of nonparametric methods , which is roughly in the tens of thousands of data points on modern desktop workstations . in this paper",
    "we summarize recent work in computer science , in collaboration with astronomers and statisticians ( pica group , ` www.picagroup.org ` ) which has significantly extended the ability of astronomers to perform nonparametric statistical calculations with perfect or high accuracy on datasets of millions of points and beyond .",
    "a _ kd_-tree records a @xmath1-dimensional data set containing @xmath2 records .",
    "each node represents a set of data points by their bounding box .",
    "non - leaf nodes have two children , obtained by splitting the widest dimension of the parent s bounding box .",
    "this crucial aspect of the construction procedure makes this data structure _ adaptive _ to the data distribution , unlike fixed grids or other simpler tree structures . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "nodes are split until they contain only one point , where they become leaves .",
    "mrkd_-tree is a conventional _ kd_-tree decorated , at each node , with extra statistics about the node s data , such as their count , centroid , and covariance .",
    "they are an instance of the idea of ` cached sufficient statistics ' and are quite efficient in practice . _ mrkd_-trees can be built quickly , in time @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the dimensionality .",
    "figure  [ fig - mrkdtree ] shows an _ mrkd_-tree as well as simple examples of two mechanisms which can be used to reduce computation .",
    "two basic prototype problems in computational geometry are that of _ range - searching _ , or finding all points within radius @xmath4 of a query point @xmath5 , and _ range - counting _ , in which the task is to simply return the number of such points . by using the bounding boxes of subsets of the dataset associated with nodes in the tree , we can exclude all of these subsets from further exploration , recursive traversal down the appropriate subtrees . this",
    "is called _ exclusion _ pruning . in range - counting",
    ", we can additionally perform _ inclusion _ pruning , since we have stored the node counts as sufficient statistics .",
    "more complex forms of pruning are necessary for other problems .",
    "cccc    &    &    &",
    "algorithms performing operations in a manner similar to that described above have existed in computational geometry for some time .",
    "problems such as computing kernel density estimates and @xmath0-point correlation functions correspond to summations over pairs , triples , or in general @xmath0-tuples of points .",
    "we have developed a class of algorithms which dramatically reduce the algorithmic complexity for such problems : it is the extension of the previous single - tree methods to a new class we call _ multi - tree _ methods ( gray , 2003 ) .",
    "the first necessary element is the extension of the previous point - node pruning mechanisms to analogous _ node - node _ pruning mechanisms .",
    "this can be seen as a special case of extending the general algorithmic device of divide - and - conquer over a set to _ higher - order divide - and - conquer _ over multiple sets .",
    "we first consider the method of _ kernel density estimation _ ( kde ) ( silverman 1986 ) , a very widely analyzed and applied class of nonparametric density estimation techniques .",
    "analogous kernel estimators exist for nonparametric regression , and kde can be used as a subroutine to construct nonparametric classification procedures and clustering procedures .",
    "the task we consider in this paper is that of computing the density estimate @xmath6 for each point @xmath5 in a query dataset containing @xmath7 points , given a reference dataset containing @xmath8 points and a local kernel function @xmath9 centered upon each reference datum and having scale parameter @xmath10 ( the bandwidth ) , or @xmath11 .",
    "the density estimate at the @xmath12 query point @xmath5 is @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the dimensionality of the data and @xmath14 , a normalizing constant depending on @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that two typical forms for the kernel function @xmath9 are the spherical kernel ( @xmath15 if @xmath16 , otherwise @xmath17 , with normalizing constant @xmath18 , the volume of the sphere of radius @xmath10 in d dimensions ) and the gaussian kernel .",
    "the spherical kernel corresponds exactly to the range - counting problem as described earlier , but because the gaussian function does not have finite extent , our previous notion of pruning must be extended to one of _ approximation _ , which will not be described here for lack of space .",
    "_ point processes _ are stochastic processes whose realizations consist of point events in space ( or time , the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "the poisson process is the most basic and important point process model .",
    "poisson statistics thus form the foundation of spatial statistics and have long formed a critical tool in astrophysics ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the _ @xmath0-point correlation function _ ( @xmath0pcf ) corresponds to the @xmath19 moment of poisson counts .",
    "for example the joint probability of finding points in each of the three volume elements @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is given by @xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the sides of the triangle defined by the three points @xmath5 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is called the _ reduced _ 3-point correlation function . in general we refer to this quantity in place of the full correlation function since it is what we need to concern ourselves with computationally .",
    "computation of the @xmath0pcf can be viewed as a form of range - counting problem : however here the problem is that of counting the number of @xmath0-tuples whose pairwise distances match a user - specified template for the permissible ranges .",
    "the additional challenges posed by this generalization from pairs ( as in kde ) to @xmath0-tuples for arbitrary @xmath0 include the definition of an appropriate recursion strategy and allowance of all possible permutations of the template @xmath0-gon .",
    "these additional complexities will not be described here for lack of space .",
    "figure [ fig - perf ] shows some typical examples of experimental performance , ranging up to 1 million points",
    ". further details , including mathematical runtime analyses , can be found in ( gray & moore 2003 , moore _",
