    "in this work we continue our chemical composition analysis of the @xmath5 damped ly@xmath0 system from the spectrum of the bright quasar q00002620 ( v = 17.5 , @xmath12 ) observed with the uves spectrograph ( dekker et al .",
    "2000 ) at the 8.2 m eso kueyen telescope during the first commissioning in october 1999 ( molaro et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "paper i was mainly concerned with precise measurements of the oxygen and zinc abundances .",
    "the obtained o and zn metallicities together with other @xmath0-chain and iron - peak element abundances present a pattern of a galactic chemical composition different from that of the milky way . in particular , it was found that the relative abundances of @xmath0-chain and iron - peak elements , [ o , si , s / cr , fe , zn ] , are significantly lower than analogous ratios in galactic stars with comparable metallicities . the measured zn abundance , [ zn / h ] = @xmath13 dex = log ( x / h )  log ( x / h)@xmath14 , is the lowest among dlas , which implies that the @xmath5 intervening galaxy is in the early stages of its chemical evolution .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with the similar abundances found for the volatile ( zn ) and refractory ( cr and fe ) elements , [ cr / h ] = @xmath15 dex and [ fe / h ] = @xmath16 dex , which means , in turn , that the cr and fe atoms may not be locked up in dust grains and that the dust - to - gas ratio in this dla may be much lower if compared with galactic diffuse clouds with the same neutral hydrogen column densities , @xmath17 @xmath4 .",
    "the low dust - to - gas ratio in this system suggested in paper  i is consistent with the absence of significant h@xmath1 absorption at @xmath5 in the lyman @xmath18 and werner @xmath19 bands ( levshakov et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter lcfb ) as well as with the absence of co lines from the fourth positive band @xmath20 ( lu et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it should be noted that in the galactic interstellar medium , sightlines with @xmath21 @xmath4 show high fractional abundances of hydrogen in molecular form , @xmath22 ( savage et al . 1977 ) , where @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the total column densities of h@xmath1 and h , respectively . such molecular clouds with @xmath26 @xmath4",
    "provide an effective self - shielding in the lyman and werner bands preventing uv photons from penetrating the interior of the clouds and thus lowering photodissociation rates of h@xmath1 and co molecules .",
    "in contrast with the ism diffuse clouds , molecular hydrogen in dlas shows different behavior .",
    "namely , we do not observe a pronounced transition from low to high molecular fractions at total hydrogen column density near @xmath27 @xmath4 as found in the milky way disk by savage et al .",
    "the first h@xmath1 system identified at @xmath28 toward q0528250 by levshakov & varshalovich ( 1985 ) gives very low amount of h@xmath1 , @xmath29 , while @xmath30 @xmath4 ( see also srianand & petitjean 1998 and references cited therein ) .",
    "however , the second and the third h@xmath1 systems found at @xmath31 toward q0013004 ( ge & bechtold 1997 ) and at @xmath32 toward q1232 + 0815 ( ge et al . 2000 ) show high h@xmath1 abundances , @xmath33 and 0.07 , respectively ( the corresponding neutral hydrogen column densities are equal to @xmath34 @xmath4 and @xmath35 @xmath4 ) .",
    "other dlas have led so far only to upper limits , @xmath36 , with the lowest bound of @xmath37 at @xmath38 toward q1223 + 17 ( bechtold 1999 ) .",
    "lcfb derived an upper limit of @xmath39 for the dla at @xmath5 toward q00002620 .",
    "the correlation between the h@xmath1 fractional abundance and the [ cr / zn ] ratio found by ge & bechtold ( 1999 ; see their fig .",
    "1 ) suggests that @xmath40 if [ cr / zn ] @xmath41 , as measured in paper  i. this motivated us to search for the h@xmath1 transitions in the uves spectrum already discussed in paper  i. we show below that the s / n of this spectrum is indeed adequate to measure h@xmath1 , thus making this absorber the fourth one for which such a measure is available .",
    "spectroscopic observations of q00002620 are described in detail in paper  i. the spectrum was obtained with the rms uncertainty of the wavelength calibration @xmath42 km  s@xmath43 , the velocity resolution of fwhm @xmath44 km  s@xmath43 ( the corresponding bin size equals 2.4 km  s@xmath43 ) and the signal - to - noise ratio of s / n @xmath45 ( per pixel ) in the range @xmath46  which allows us to detect the l(4 - 0)r(1 ) line at the expected position , @xmath47  .",
    "the absence of this line in the 1   resolution spectrum obtained with the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) in 1988 ( lcfb ) has led to the limit @xmath48 m @xmath49 for the equivalent width of the l(4 - 0)r(1 ) line . the uves spectrum shown in fig .",
    "1a provides @xmath50 m . the local continuum level in the vicinity of the l(4 - 0)r(1 ) line was additionally controlled by the optical depth value of the lyman - limit discontinuity @xmath51 from the metal system at @xmath52 ( savaglio et al .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 where the estimated continuum level between 4555  and 4660  is shown by the dotted line .",
    "the vertical line at @xmath53  marks the lyman - limit position for the @xmath52 system . the expected optical depth in the continuum at @xmath54   is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "we have thoroughly investigated all possible coincidences of the l(4 - 0)r(1 ) position with metal absorptions from other systems observed toward q00002620 . only one such case was found .",
    "the position of the @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) line from the metal system at @xmath58 detected by savaglio et al .",
    "( 1997 ) differs from the center of the l(4 - 0)r(1 ) line by only @xmath59 km  s@xmath43 . if the feature observed ( @xmath60 m )",
    "were due to this absorption , we would obtain @xmath61 m and @xmath62 @xmath4 using the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "this would imply an abundance [ c / h ] @xmath63 which is unlikely , due to the high redshift of the absorber .",
    "we remark that even assuming a solar carbon abundance , [ c / h ] = 0 , and the unrealistic suggestion that all carbon is in the form ( savaglio et al .",
    "have detected in this system which is not a dla ) we find that @xmath64 m .",
    "this result implies that the absorption at @xmath58 does not affect significantly the h@xmath1 profile .",
    "the identification of other h@xmath1 transitions from the lyman and werner bands is hampered by blending with numerous ly@xmath0 forest lines .",
    "therefore , to obtain quantitative estimates of the total molecular hydrogen column density and the excitation temperature , @xmath65 , we choose small continuum ` windows ' which are less obscured by the ly@xmath0 forest absorption features and where some h@xmath1 lines are expected .",
    "the following is a description of the adopted procedure .      the inferred h@xmath1 column density , @xmath66 , depends on the populations of the first rotational levels @xmath67 in the ground state , @xmath65 , and the doppler @xmath68-parameter . in thermal equilibrium , the ratio of the column densities @xmath69 is given by @xmath70\\ ; , \\label{eq : e1}\\ ] ] where the statistical weight of a level @xmath71 is @xmath72 for odd @xmath71 and @xmath73 for even @xmath71 ( the ortho- and para - h@xmath1 , respectively ) , and the constant @xmath74  k for the vibrational ground state .",
    "the central optical depth , @xmath75 , for the resolved absorption line is determined by ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the oscillator strength of the transition , @xmath78 its wavelength in  , @xmath79 the total column density in @xmath4 , and @xmath68 the doppler parameter in km  s@xmath43 . for the h@xmath1 lines , wavelengths and oscillator strengths",
    "were taken from the list of morton & dinerstein ( 1976 ) .    to estimate the ortho - h@xmath1 column density , @xmath80 , and the @xmath68-parameter , we fit theoretical voigt profiles to the observed intensities via @xmath81 minimization using a fixed value of @xmath82 which corresponds to the redshift of the isolated @xmath83 absorption line ( paper  i ) . during the fitting procedure",
    "the theoretical profiles are convolved with a gaussian of the instrumental width of 6 km  s@xmath43 .",
    "we tried to find a satisfactory result with the reduced @xmath81 per degree of freedom of @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the expected @xmath81 value for @xmath86 degrees of freedom at the credible probability of 70 % ) .",
    "we used the velocity range @xmath87 km  s@xmath43 where we have @xmath88 .",
    "the best fit with @xmath89 is shown in fig .",
    "1a by the solid curve , whereas points with error bars give the normalized intensities ( the corresponding s / n @xmath45 ) .    the best solution yields @xmath90 @xmath4 and @xmath91 km  s@xmath43",
    "of course , our analysis gives a certain range for allowable @xmath80 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1b , where the 70  % confidence region for this pair of physical parameters is restricted by the upper part of the ellipse over the line @xmath92 km  s@xmath43 .",
    "the second part of the ellipse under this horizontal dashed line may be excluded from consideration since the @xmath68-value of the heaviest element equals @xmath93 km  s@xmath43 ( paper  i ) , otherwise one would have a zone where @xmath94 .",
    "the cross in fig .",
    "1b marks the point of maximum likelihood for the best fit . two additional curves in fig .",
    "1a ( dotted and dashed ) show the l(4 - 0)r(1 ) profiles for the limiting values of @xmath95 @xmath4 and @xmath96 @xmath4 , respectively . both of them have @xmath97 .",
    "to summarize , we set @xmath98 @xmath4 and @xmath99 km  s@xmath43 .",
    "let us now turn to the estimation of the total @xmath24 .",
    "as mentioned above the total molecular hydrogen column density depends on @xmath65 .",
    "typical ism diffuse molecular clouds have a mean @xmath100 excitation temperature of @xmath101 k , with the bulk lying in the range from 45 to 128 k ( savage et al . 1977 ) .",
    "the excitation temperature @xmath102 reflects the relative populations of @xmath103 and 1 rotational levels which are controlled by thermal particle collisions .",
    "therefore @xmath102 is approximately equal to the kinetic temperature , @xmath104 , of the cloud .",
    "the population of the higher rotational levels are established by collisions , uv pumping and radiative cascades after photo - absorption to the lyman and werner bands and thus @xmath65 for the higher levels may differ from @xmath102 in dense molecular clouds ( see , e.g. a review by dalgarno 1976 ) . however , for tenuous clouds , a unique temperature for all the levels can be found suggesting that the rotational population could be dominated by collisions in a gas whose kinetic temperature is near @xmath65 .",
    "for example , the excitation temperature of @xmath105 k toward @xmath106  pup was measured for @xmath107 by morton & dinerstein ( 1976 ) .",
    "there is also a tendency toward low excitation temperatures @xmath108 k for the clouds with @xmath109 , whereas clouds with @xmath110 tend to higher @xmath65 ( spitzer & jenkins 1975 ) .",
    "note that spin temperatures @xmath111 k have been measured in dlas with @xmath112 @xmath4 for which 21  cm line measurements are available ( de bruyn et al .",
    "1996 , carilli et al .",
    "these measurements assume , however , a similar covering factor of the optical and radio background source .    the excitation temperature can be estimated directly from the comparison of the population density in h@xmath1 rotational levels or indirectly from the thermal width of the h@xmath1 lines assuming that @xmath65 is approximately equal to the kinetic temperature of the cloud .",
    "for the dla in question , we know exactly that the line widths do not reflect the thermal motion since all species from the lightest h@xmath1 to the heaviest zn show approximately the same @xmath68-values ( see paper  i ) .",
    "we also have not accurate measurements of @xmath69 for different @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , to estimate @xmath65 we applied another method .",
    "we choose the continuum ` windows ' which are sensitive to the presence of the h@xmath1 absorption and set upper limits for @xmath69 using the inequality @xmath113 with @xmath114 being the observed limit at the expected h@xmath1 transition and @xmath115 the quantity calculated from ( 2 ) . in this estimations",
    "we used @xmath116 km  s@xmath43 .",
    "the obtained limits are depicted by short horizontal bars in fig .",
    "now we know the upper limits @xmath117 for @xmath118 and the measured @xmath80 value . to estimate @xmath65 consider the following function  : @xmath119 where for @xmath118 we have @xmath120 and for @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath124 is calculated as @xmath125\\ ; . \\label{eq : e5}\\ ] ]    it follows from the definition of @xmath126 that the allowable range for @xmath65 should correspond to the maximum value of @xmath127 ( here equals 6 ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath127 as function of @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "3a which readily gives the range 50  k @xmath128 1400  k. the range is rather wide since we have only one unblended h@xmath1 line .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the obtained limits do not contradict the above mentioned observational estimations of @xmath65 .",
    "3b gives additional illustrations for our procedure .",
    "here we show the measured @xmath129 and estimated @xmath130 column densities against energies of the low rotational levels .",
    "three different lines represent solutions for @xmath131 , 500 and 1400  k. as seen , at low @xmath65 the most sensitive are the @xmath132 and @xmath121 transitions , whereas at high @xmath65 the most stringent restriction is set by the populations of the @xmath133 and @xmath134 rotational levels .    these two regimes are shown in fig .  4 where dots with error bars are the observed normalized intensities within the chosen windows , and the solid curves show the h@xmath1 synthetic profiles calculated with @xmath116 km  s@xmath43 and the limiting column densities listed in the corresponding panels .",
    "if @xmath65 lies between 50  k and 1400  k , the total molecular hydrogen column density @xmath24 ranges from @xmath135 @xmath4 to @xmath136 @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) where the lower value is obtained at @xmath137 . thus we may set @xmath138 . with @xmath139 taken from lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and assuming that the molecular gas coincide with the ( i.e. filling factor is 1 ) , one finds @xmath140 or @xmath6 .",
    "since h@xmath1 molecules are formed more efficiently on dust grains in high column density clouds , we can conclude that the dust number density in the @xmath5 absorbing material is lower than in the ism clouds with @xmath21 @xmath4 , provided the dust destruction rate is the same .",
    "the presence of dust in dlas is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 where the relation between @xmath141 and relative heavy element depletion , [ cr / zn ] , is shown . in dlas , the amount of dust is usually estimated from the ratio @xmath142 assuming that zn is undepleted ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) .    the measured data for the four extragalactic molecular clouds ( dots in fig .  6 ) can be very well fitted with a linear law  : @xmath143 - 7.1 $ ] , which means that these quantities are strongly correlated ( dashed line in fig .",
    "another four dlas with high neutral hydrogen column densities where the h@xmath1 absorption has not yet been detected ( see table  1 ) are marked by vertical arrows .",
    "crosses in fig .",
    "6 are the galactic interstellar medium measurements taken from the compilation of roth & blades ( 1995 ) . by the horizontal lines we mark the h@xmath1 measurements in the magellanic clouds ( richter 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding [ cr / zn ] data are not available yet , therefore , to restrict their plausible range we took the limiting values of [ cr / zn ] @xmath144 and @xmath145 obtained from different sightline measurements in the magellanic clouds by roth & blades ( 1997 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the dla data , including the @xmath9 upper limits , exhibit the same tendency as the galactic ism diffuse clouds , i.e. clouds with large amount of h@xmath1 show higher heavy element depletion .",
    "the linear correlation among the dla systems is then a kind of upper envelope of all the different types of data points .",
    "the fact that the ism measurements are found at higher cr depletion than the dla data is probably due to the higher metallicity and dust content of interstellar clouds . in fact , there is evidence for a correlation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity among dla systems ( vladilo 1998 ) .",
    "given such a correlation , it is natural to expect that dla points , which have lower metallicities than interstellar clouds , have also lower cr depletion .",
    "the lack of any data points above the envelope can be readily explained because clouds with low dust content ( and low cr depletion ) are expected to have low molecular content .",
    "it is interesting that the data of the magellanic clouds fall in the range occupied by dlas , as expected . indeed , typical dust - to - gas ratios in the magellanic clouds are about 4 times ( lmc ) and 8 times ( smc ) lower as compared with the milky way ( koornneef 1982 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1985 , respectively ) .",
    "the fact that the dla measurements lie on the envelope while the upper limits lie below is puzzling .",
    "one possible explanation is the presence of some selection effect that allows us to detect h@xmath1 at high cr depletions only when the h@xmath1 lines are sufficiently strong",
    ". this could be the case if dust obscuration is important .",
    "the dust number density , @xmath146 , in the @xmath5 cloud may be estimated from the measured h@xmath1 fractional abundance assuming that the h@xmath1 formation rate on dust grains , @xmath147 , is in equilibrium with the h@xmath1 destruction caused by uv photons .",
    "another channel of the h@xmath1 formation through the formation of the catalyst h@xmath148",
    "( e.g. , donahue & shull 1991 ) may compete with the dust process in the partially ionized warm regions and will not be considered here because of the very high column density in the @xmath5 cloud which provides most of the gas to be neutral . in the mostly neutral gas , h@xmath1 will be in equilibrium with a density ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 )  :    @xmath149    where @xmath150 is the h@xmath1 photo - dissociation rate in s@xmath43 , @xmath151 in @xmath152 , and @xmath147 in @xmath153s@xmath43 . for tenuous interstellar clouds , @xmath154 , with @xmath155 being the photo - absorption rate in the lyman- and werner- bands .",
    "the h@xmath1 formation rate on dust grains can be written as ( spitzer 1978 )  : @xmath156 where the constant @xmath157 , the mean thermal velocity of the atoms caused by particle collisions @xmath158 in cm  s@xmath43 , and @xmath159 is the mean area obscured by dust grains in 1  @xmath153 along the sightline .",
    "the value of @xmath155 depends on the local uv radiation field .",
    "the intergalactic background radiation at @xmath160 gives @xmath161 s@xmath43 if @xmath162(912 ) = 1 ( srianand & petitjean 1998 ) .",
    "if we take into account that locally in the intervening galaxy the uv emission from hot stars may increase @xmath155 by a factor of @xmath163 , then using ( [ eq : e6 ] ) and ( [ eq : e7 ] ) we have an estimate @xmath164 where we took @xmath165 ) which is valid for the q00002620 cloud .",
    "given the mean galactic value @xmath166 cm@xmath43 ( spitzer 1978 ) , one has @xmath168    if @xmath169 and the linear size distribution function for the dust grains is invariant , then for the @xmath5 cloud the last relation yields @xmath170 .",
    "it is reasonable to compare this quantity with the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath171 , which may be estimated from any two elements x and y having similar nucleosynthetic history ( cf .",
    "vladilo 1998 )  : @xmath172_{\\rm obs } } } { f_{\\rm x , ism } - f_{\\rm y , ism}}\\left ( 10^{[{\\rm y}/{\\rm x}]_{\\rm obs } } - 1\\right)\\ : , \\label{eq : e9a}\\ ] ] where the fraction in dust @xmath173 refers to the galactic interstellar medium .    by applying error propagation to the column density measurements for the @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 lines ( table  1 in paper  i ) , one can find that [ fe / zn ] @xmath177 and [ cr / zn ] @xmath178 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : e9a ] ) implies that positive values of the [ fe / zn ] and [ cr / zn ] ratios are unphysical because of the dust depletions @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "therefore we can estimate only maximum value of @xmath171 taking low bounds of [ fe / zn ] = @xmath182 and [ cr / zn ] @xmath183 , and the upper bound of [ zn / h ] @xmath184 . under these conditions",
    "we have @xmath11 .",
    "this value corresponds precisely to the dust number density ratio estimated above from the h@xmath1 fractional abundance .",
    "the same result implies that the current interpretation of the cr / zn ratios as due to differential dust depletion rather than intrinsic chemical abundance differences of zn , as claimed by several authors , is correct .",
    "the accuracy of the estimated physical parameters @xmath24 and @xmath65 may be improved by additional observations of the quasar 00002620 to increase the signal - to - noise ratio at the expected positions of the l(1 - 0)r(2 ) and l(9 - 0)r(4 ) lines where we observe rather narrow ( @xmath185 km  s@xmath43 ) continuum windows free from the ly@xmath0 forest contaminations ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . at some level of s /",
    "n one may detect weak absorption features corresponding to these h@xmath1 transitions .",
    "for the measured ortho - h@xmath1 column density @xmath90 @xmath4 , such detection at @xmath186 level becomes possible starting from s / n @xmath187 , if @xmath188  k ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the s / n ratios listed in table  2 were estimated in the following way .    for weak absorption lines ( @xmath189 ) one has ( see lcfb )  : @xmath190 where the equivalent width @xmath191 is given in m , @xmath79 in @xmath4 , and @xmath78 in  .    the equivalent width detection limit , @xmath192 , defined in lcfb , depends on the spectral resolution , the mean s / n value per pixel and the accuracy of the continuum fit , @xmath193 , over the width of the line  : @xmath194^{1/2}\\ : , \\label{eq : e11}\\ ] ] where @xmath195fwhm is the full width ( in pixels ) at the continuum level of a weak absorption line , and @xmath196 is the pixel size in  .    for real data , @xmath197 since the continuum level is usually estimated as a mean intensity over @xmath198 pixels within a continuum window .",

    "taking @xmath206 , we find s / n values from ( [ eq : e12 ] ) .",
    "the obtained results listed in the sixth and seventh columns of table  2 show that the l(1 - 0)r(2 ) and/or l(9 - 0)r(4 ) lines may be detected for a reasonable exposure time if @xmath65 is not very low in the @xmath5 absorbing cloud .",

    "the outcome of our study , aiming to provide a measurement of the molecular hydrogen abundance in the low metallicity dla galaxy at @xmath5 toward q0000 - 2620 , is as follows .",
    "the application of the standard voigt fitting analysis to this line gives the ortho - h@xmath1 column density of @xmath227 @xmath4 and the doppler width @xmath99 km  s@xmath43 .",
    "the width of the h@xmath1 line is found to match those for numerous unsaturated metal lines measured at the same redshift in paper  i.    \\3 .",
    "the upper limits to the column densities of the w(0 - 0)r(0)+r(1 ) , l(1 - 0)r(2 ) , l(10 - 0)p(3 ) , l(9 - 0)r(4 ) , l(9 - 0)r(5 ) lines together with the measured value of @xmath228 lead to the excitation temperature @xmath65 ranging from 50  k to 1400  k.    \\4 . the range of @xmath65 and the @xmath228 value yield , in turn , the total h@xmath1 column density of @xmath229 @xmath4 and the h@xmath1 fractional abundance of @xmath6 .",
    "this is the lowest h@xmath1 fractional abundance ever measured .",
    "assuming that the h@xmath1 formation rate on dust grains is in equilibrium with the h@xmath1 destruction caused by uv photons , the dust number density is estimated in the @xmath5 cloud , @xmath10 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath11 found independently from the [ cr / zn ] and [ fe / zn ] abundance ratios .",
    "it is shown that future observations with higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath230 ) may reveal a few additional h@xmath1 lines from the @xmath5 system which may increase the accuracy of the @xmath24 and @xmath65 measurements .",
    "we are deeply indebted to the people involved in the realization of the uves spectrograph which made possible to achieve the results presented here .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for his / her comments .",
