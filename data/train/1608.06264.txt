    "alternatively , the mass discrepancy can be interpreted as a breakdown of the newtonian law of gravity . in particular , modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , in which the gravitational force is larger than the standard newtonian gravitational force at accelerations below a value @xmath1 cm s@xmath2 , can account for the shape and amplitude of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies amazingly well , except for a handful of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in practice , the quality of mond fits to the rotation curves are sensitive to uncertainties in the adopted parameters of the galaxy such as inclination , distance or the adopted form of the interpolating function @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , noncircular motions and warps may also affect the observed rotation curve .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate other gravitational effects which can offer independent tests ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a compilation of evidence that supports mond ) .    in the dark matter models , the separate contributions to the rotation curve from the baryonic components and dark matter",
    "are not easily disentangled because equally well - fitting models to the rotation curve can be obtained with different stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "for unbarred galaxies , disc stability constraints may provide upper limits on the surface density of stellar discs or , equivalently , to the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is usually argued that unbarred galaxies with slowly rising rotation curves at the centre are stabilized against bar instabilities by dark haloes , whereas unbarred galaxies with circular velocities @xmath5 km s@xmath6 use to present a steep inner rise in the rotation curve and may be stabilized by their hard centres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of dwarf galaxies and low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , many studies led to the generally accepted picture that many of these galaxies are dominated by dark matter at almost all radii , especially those galaxies that have gently rising rotation curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) for instance , @xcite considered a sample of @xmath7 ealy - type dwarf galaxies and found that if the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath8-band is assumed to be near unity , as predicted by stellar population synthesis , all galaxies except one are dominated by dark matter .",
    "the dominant dark matter halo and the low surface density could explain the rarity of bars in lsb galaxies @xcite . still , some lsb galaxies may be massive enough to become bar unstable @xcite .",
    "rotating haloes , triaxial haloes , the dynamical state of cosmological haloes , the physics of gas and baryons , and tidal interactions may lead to bar formation even in some dwarf and lsb galaxies @xcite . due to all these factors , predictions on the fraction of barred galaxies as a function of hubble type are difficult .    in mond , the rotation curve sets the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disc and thus there is less freedom to adjust the surface density of the disc , which is a crucial determinant in the stability analysis .",
    "although it is simple to show from the basic tenets of mond , that discs with low internal accelerations ( deep mond regime ) are more stable than purely newtonian discs @xcite , the added stability is limited .",
    "indeed , discs in the deep mond regime are more unstable in mond than in the equivalent newtonian galaxy , that is the same disc but embedded in a rigid halo to have the same circular velocity . given the limited stability provided by mond , the following questions arise : does mond predict the correct level of stability in galaxies with gently rising rotation curves at their centres ? what about the stability of galaxies that are not in the deep mond regime ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that mond naturally provides the required level of disc self - gravity to explain the existence of bars and spiral structure observed in some ( red ) lsb galaxies ( although the spiral arms in these galaxies are fragmentary , extremely faint and difficult to trace ) .",
    "stability studies in pressure - supported stellar systems can be also used to discriminate between modified gravity theories and newtonian gravity plus a dark matter halo . @xcite",
    "found that mond systems are more prone to radial - orbit instability than their equivalent newtonian systems .",
    "they suggested that stability constraints combined with their measured velocity dispersion profiles in globular clusters ( e.g. , ngc 2419 ) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies could provide crucial tests for mond models .    in this work ,",
    "we have selected six pure - disc galaxies having high - quality rotation curves in their inner regions .",
    "we consider separately the standard dark matter scenario and mond . to be satisfactory , the models should be able to reproduce correctly the shape and amplitude of the rotation curves for reasonable values of @xmath4 , but also the level of gravitational stability of the disc in these galaxies . since the selected galaxies do not have a dense centre able to stabilize the stellar disc against bar - forming modes , high levels of instability",
    "would be very difficult to reconcile with detailed images that reveal no evidence for the presence of strong bars .",
    "moreover , if mond is a good effective theory ( albeit not definitive ) to describe the phenomenology of galaxies , the stability analysis in the mond framework may be used as a tool to make testable predictions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : basis ]",

    "there is a solid embodiement to suggest that the multicomponent ( cold gas , warm gas and stars ) toomre stability parameter @xmath9 lies in the range @xmath10 within the optical radius of disc galaxies .",
    "the toomre parameter is required to be @xmath11 to avoid a violent fragmentation instability but it is generally less than @xmath12 in order to allow the discs to have a level of self - gravity enough to develop spiral structures and self - regulated star formation @xcite .      in cold discs ( i.e. @xmath10 ) , swing amplification of perturbations in the disc may lead to the grow of non - axisymmetric structures ( toomre 1981 ) . for a disc with surface density @xmath14 and epicyclic frequency @xmath15 , the wavelength that preferently grows , @xmath16 ,",
    "can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a dimensionless factor which depends on the local derivative of the circular velocity .",
    "for instance , if the rotation curve is parameterized by a power - law , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 when @xmath22 ( flat rotation curve ) , and @xmath23 when @xmath24 ( athanassoula 1984 ; fuchs 2001 ; mayer et al .",
    "2001 ) . for linearly rising rotation curves",
    "( @xmath25 ) , the low rate of differential rotation suppresses the swing amplification .",
    "however , resonances may support global modes ( lynden - bell 1979 ) and the spiral structure is difficult to predict .",
    "the density wave theory predicts that the number of spiral arms or multiplicity @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 it is convenient to define the @xmath13-parameter , which depends on @xmath8 , as @xmath28 the maximum amplification of the mode with multiplicity @xmath26 will occur at those radii for which @xmath29 ( toomre 1981 ; athanassoula 1984 ; athanassoula et al .",

    "according to equation ( [ eq : xm_newton ] ) , discs of a fixed rotation curve should exhibit higher spiral - arm multiplicity ( and a smaller amplitude of the arms ) when the disc mass is decreased . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m_newton ] ) and ( [ eq : xm_newton ] ) , it is simple to show that the predicted number of arms can be determined from @xmath30 through the relation @xmath31 .    the spiral arm multiplicity has been used as a powerful tool to constrain the mass of the disc in spiral galaxies and , thereby , the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xcite .",
    "the analysis above is valid under the assumption that the stellar discs are dynamically cold ( i.e. @xmath32 ) . in hot discs , however , the amplification factor due to the swing amplification may be highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "still , galaxies may present occasional , weak spiral structures due to resonances @xcite or interactions with companions .",
    "if galactic discs are cold and massive , they may generate a large bar structure .",
    "as a diagnostic of the expected morphology of a certain galaxy , it would be very useful to have a recipe to predict when galaxies develop @xmath33 spiral arms or form a bar .",
    "although @xmath30 might be used as a diagnostic for bar formation ( e.g. , mihos et al .",
    "1997 ) , it was derived in linear theory and strictly it can not provide a criterion to distinguish bar stable to bar unstable discs .",
    "one has to use numerical simulations to study collective global instabilities .",
    "efstathiou , lake & negroponte ( 1982 , hereafter enl ) derived a stability criterion for bar formation in isolated ( bulgeless ) galaxies ; cold exponential discs with a toomre parameter close to but larger than @xmath34 are bar stable if @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the maximum rotational velocity , @xmath37 is the mass of the disc and @xmath38 its radial scale length .",
    "the enl criterion provides an approximate indicator for stability in cold galaxies ( @xmath39 ) lacking a dense core or bulge ( mayer & wadsley 2004 ; yurin & springel 2015 ; barnes 2016 ) .",
    "once @xmath36 and @xmath38 are measured , this criterion sets an upper value on @xmath37 and thereby on @xmath4 , which we denote by @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to note that the enl criterion was derived for discs in rigid haloes .",
    "if haloes are made of collisionless particles , the disc - halo interaction produces a destabilizing influence ( athanassoula 2008 ; sellwood 2016 ) , which may lead to the formation of bars in galaxies that are bar stable by the enl criterion .",
    "thus , in bulgeless galaxies the @xmath40 values should be considered as conservative upper limits , unless the level of random stellar motions are larger than usually assumed in these simulations .",
    "puglielli et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter pwc ) found that a strong bar is formed if two conditions are met .",

    "the second condition is that @xmath43 , where the brakets @xmath44 represent the average value over two radial scale - lengths ( see also puglielli 2011 ) , but excluding the central region @xmath45 ( @xmath46 the vertical scaleheight , which is assumed to be one fifth of the radial scalelength ) , where the razor - thin disc approximation is not valid .",
    "this condition imposes a maximum value for the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath47 , for galaxies with no strong bars .",
    "we will consider mond as a modification of gravity s law , rather than a change in the inertia .",
    "we consider two popular ` modified - gravity ' formulations of mond , which provide a field equation between the density distribution of a system @xmath48 and its associated gravitational potential @xmath49 .",
    "the first one is the non - linear extension of the poisson equation suggested by bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) given by @xmath50 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eq : mb84}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a universal acceleration of the order of @xmath52 cm s@xmath2 , and @xmath3 is some interpolating function with the property that @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",

    "the case @xmath59 corresponds to the standard form proposed by @xcite , whereas the case @xmath60 is the so - called `` simple '' @xmath57-function suggested by @xcite .",
    "the second one is the quasi - linear mond ( qumond ) formulation developed by @xcite : @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the newtonian potential , which satisfies the standard poisson equation @xmath63 .",
    "the non - linear modified poisson equation and qumond are equivalent in a spherical distribution of mass if @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .      using the non - linear poisson equation ( eq .",

    "therefore , the toomre and @xmath13 parameters in the non - linear extension of the poisson equation are @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "the prefactor @xmath76 is in general @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , mond discs should exhibit a lower spiral - arm multiplicity and a larger amplitude of the arms than their equivalent newtonian systems . in the newtonian regime",
    ", it holds that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and hence the prefactor is equal to @xmath34 . in the deep mond regime , @xmath80 and thus the prefactor is @xmath81 .",
    "however , it is misleading to think that galaxies in the deep mond regime ( i.e. , galaxies with @xmath82 ) will have very small @xmath13-values .",
    "indeed , @xmath15 depends on @xmath57 because of the boost that mond produces in the rotation velocity . in appendix",

    ", a halo is added to have the same circular velocity ) .",
    "therefore , galaxies in mond are expected to be more unstable , locally and globally , than their equivalent newtonian galaxies .",

    "the formation and evolution of a bar in mond and in newtonian dynamics were described in @xcite .",
    "they found that the bars in mond galaxies develop very soon as compared to the newtonian dark matter models .",
    "since mond discs are more unstable than their newtonian dark matter analogs , discs with @xmath87 are also expected to be bar unstable in mond .",

    "for instance , even if we adopt a value twice lower than @xmath146 , the @xmath30 parameter increases by less than @xmath119 ; the effect is not significant .",

    "ngc 5963 is a genuinely puzzling system in mond ; the fit to the rotation curve is poor and the disc is likely to be unstable to bar modes ( unless @xmath75 at @xmath190 is larger than @xmath193 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is unclear if a more realistic modelling , rather than using our oversimplifing assumptions ( e.g. a constant @xmath4 across the galaxy , see  [ sec : rcs_mond ] ) , could bring this galaxy into agreement with observations .",

    "@xcite claimed that the velocity dispersions inferred in the @xmath138-band trace the old stellar population because a young population has far fewer absorption lines and they are located at the blue part of the optical spectrum ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , a contamination by young stars with low velocity dispersion would lead to an underestimate of the velocity dispersion .",
    "in fact , @xcite estimated that in the solar neighbourhood , the velocity dispersion derived in the @xmath138-band is about @xmath194 smaller than the mass - weighted velocity dispersion .",
    "for bluer galaxies , the @xmath138-band velocity dispersion could underestimate the mass - weighted velocity dispersion by a larger fraction .",
    "if galaxies were observed in the near @xmath195-band , as those used by @xcite , k - giants dominate the velocity dispersion signal @xcite . in the solar neigbourhood ,",

    "it is worthwhile noting that , under mond , a vertical velocity dispersion higher ( by @xmath151 on average ) than derived from population - integrated line profiles , is also required to explain the thickness of @xmath178 disc galaxies from the diskmass survey @xcite .",
