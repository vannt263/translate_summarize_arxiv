    "in the past several years , reactor neutrino experiments @xcite and long baseline accelerator experiments @xcite have produced important advances in our understanding of neutrino mixing by measuring the key mixing parameter @xmath0 by two completely independent processes .",
    "the reactor experiments measure @xmath1 disappearance in the flux of @xmath2s , indicating oscillation into other neutrino flavors during the one or two kilometer trip from reactor core to detector .",
    "the accelerator experiment measures the appearance of a @xmath3 component in the @xmath4 beam from an accelerator during the hundreds of kilometers trip from the accelerator laboratory to the detection site .",
    "together , the results already constrain the cp - violating phase angle in the mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "moreover , the data provide a potentially powerful probe of non - standard interactions ( nsi ) @xcite in the neutrino sector involving some combination of neutrino source , propagation , and detection @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the constraints on semi - leptonic , charged current , non - universal ( nu ) and flavor - changing ( fc ) parameters and likewise for both nu and fc purely leptonic nsi parameters .",
    "the former appear in effective lagrangians for neutrino production from reactors and from accelerators and for neutrino detection by inverse beta decay .",
    "the latter appear in neutrino production from muon decay and from neutrino detection by @xmath5or @xmath6 scattering .",
    "we will focus on the case of _ very _ short baseline reactor @xmath1 source and detection of the recoil electron from @xmath7 scattering at the detector .",
    "we rely heavily on the example provided by the texono experiment texono1,texono2 , which measures the recoil electron spectrum from reactor anti - neutrinos interacting with electrons in a csi(tl ) detector .",
    "the baseline is less than 30 m , and the oscillation of the beam can be ignored , thus providing an especially clean test of fc `` wrong flavor '' @xmath8 or @xmath9 or nu `` right flavor '' @xmath10 from the semileptonic nuclear decays in the reactor .",
    "baselines this short avoid the degeneracies between nsi parameters and standard neutrino mixing parameters that occur in analysis of data from reactor experiments with kilometer @xcite or tens of kilometer baselines @xcite , degeneracies that are touched on in several recent studies @xcite .    we extend work in ref . @xcite by incorporating the effects of nsi produced at the source and by including the phase dependence of the fc nsi at the detector using the data from texono s experiment . in ref .",
    "texono2 , only the nsi at the detector in the single channel of @xmath11scattering are considered .",
    "with nsi at the source , there is a modification of the @xmath1 component and an addition of @xmath12 and @xmath13 components , so @xmath14scattering and @xmath15scattering must be incorporated by including nsi in the elastic , purely neutral current ( nc ) , @xmath12e and @xmath13e cross sections , applicable for analyzing data from any short baseline neutrino scattering experiment where the oscillation effects are ignorable .",
    "our `` no nsi propagation effects '' study complements those that probe nsi with solar neutrino , accelerator neutrino and other reactor neutrino experiments , which involve different combinations of nsi at source , propagation and detection effects @xcite .    in section ii , iii and iv , we define our notation , specify our cross sections and define the flux factors that go with each cross section to unify all the standard model ( sm ) plus nsi contributions to the rate at source and detector in a single framework .",

    "we confine ourselves to the left - handed quark helicity projection case for simplicity .",
    "the inclusion of the right handed terms adds nothing essential to our discussion . since we consider the neutrino - propagation baselines are only a few tens of meters and the energies are in the mev range , therefore oscillations play no role and we can effectively replace @xmath22 in  making the rate calculations we present here .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath23 represent the relative coupling strengths of the flavor combinations in the presence of new physics , while in the sm , @xmath24    to represent the nsi effects in the purely leptonic sector @xcite for the simplified elastic @xmath6 scattering case of interest , we write the effective lagrangian as    @xmath25    the first term in eq .
