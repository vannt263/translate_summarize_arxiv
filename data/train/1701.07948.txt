    "while the single mode state is defined by only two quadratures ( @xmath81 ) , yielding a 2d wigner map , the two - mode state has 4 degrees of freedom ( @xmath82 or linear combinations ) , yielding a 4d wigner map . for a single mode , standard homodyne can extract the full quadrature in a single shot , allowing complete wigner reconstruction , whereas two - mode homodyne ( standard or parametric )",
    "only partially measures the two - mode quadrature in a single shot , setting some limitations on the wigner reconstruction for two - modes , but not completely preventing it .",
    "a two - mode oscillation requires two phases , conveniently defined as the carrier phase ( @xmath83  the sum of mode phases ) and the beat envelope phase ( @xmath84  the difference ) .",
    "the quadratures relate only to the carrier phase ( cosine or sine ) , and must therefore carry the envelope phase as an additional degree of freedom . to measure the complete two - mode quadrature in a single shot , the complex value of @xmath85 should be obtained @xcite , both real and imaginary parts : @xmath86&= x+ x^{\\dag } =   x_s+ x_i\\\\ \\text{im } [ x(\\omega)]&=i ( x- x^{\\dag } ) = y_s- y_i.\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    despite the mathematical similarity of @xmath87 and @xmath88 to the definition of the single - mode quadratures @xmath89 , their physical meaning is inherently different .",
    "the field operators @xmath90 do not commute ( @xmath91\\!=\\!1 $ ] ) , whereas @xmath92 do ( @xmath93\\!=\\!0 $ ] ) , indicating that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath30 can , in principle , be measured simultaneously in a single shot ( as opposed to @xmath94 ) .",
    "thus , since the phase of the envelope relates to commuting observables ( as opposed to the carrier phase ) , it does not reflect a nonclassical property of the quantum light field , but rather defines the temporal mode in which the field is measured .",
    "specifically , the temporal mode of measurement is the beat pattern of frequency @xmath16 , where the temporal offset of the beat is defined by the envelope phase .",
    "this offset , along with other mode parameters , such as polarization , spatial mode , carrier frequency , etc .",
    "define the mode of the local oscillator .",
    "of course , quantum entanglement of the state between the two envelope modes ( cosine or sine ) is possible , just like entanglement of a single photon ( or photon pair , or cat state ) between polarization modes , which is widely used for quantum information .",
    "however , this quantumness is additional and different , on top of the intra - mode quantum state , which is described by the quadratures .",
    "since standard homodyne is a destructive measurement , it can measure either @xmath45 $ ] or @xmath46 $ ] in a single shot . in analogy to light polarization , standard homodyne acts as an absorptive polarizer that detects one polarization but absorbs the other .",
    "parametric homodyne ( with only intensity detection ) measures the quadrature intensity @xmath95 , but not it s phase .",
    "since the instantaneous quadrature intensity @xmath95 can be evaluated in every shot , not just it s mean value , the entire distribution of the intensity can be measured , including higher moments ( @xmath96  ) .",
    "the quadrature intensity is directly measured by parametric homodyne only in the limit of large gain . however , since two light intensity measurements along orthogonal axes uniquely infer the two quadrature intensities at any finite gain , the information content of a single detection of the output intensity is equivalent to that of the quadrature intensity at any gain . to derive this equivalence ,",
    "let us examine the relation between the field operators at the output and the quadratures of the input : @xmath97 where g is the parametric gain and @xmath98 is the angle of the rotated quadrature axis @xmath99 .",
    "as mentioned , the field operator converges in the limit of large gain to an amplified single quadrature operator @xmath100 , but , this convergence can never be exact since the commutation relation of field operators @xmath91\\!=\\!1 $ ] is inherently different than that of quadrature operators @xmath93\\!=\\!0 $ ] . to illuminate the smooth transition from a field operator to a quadrature ,",
    "let us express the field operator for any finite parametric gain in the form of a `` generalized '' quadrature operator along an axis of a complex angle @xmath101 , @xmath102 where the imaginary part of the quadrature axis and the normalization factor @xmath103 relate to the gain @xmath54 by @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the single - shot measurement of the output light intensity with any parametric gain reflects the intensity of the `` generalized '' quadrature at this gain value , and not the standard ( real ) quadrature .",

    "since the overall phase @xmath115 does not affect the photon - number calculations , we may discard it as @xmath116 . in this expression",
    "we account for the phase of the pump as a rotation of the input quadrature axis - @xmath117 .",
    "accordingly , the rotated complex quadrature operators ( equation [ complexquadamp ] ) become @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "parametric amplification directly amplifies one input quadrature and attenuates the other , as evident by expressing the field operators @xmath120 at the amplifier output using the quadrature operators @xmath94 of the input : @xmath121 finally , the parametric photon - number operator at the output becomes : @xmath122 the first term @xmath123 does not depend on the pump phase and contributes only an offset to the expectation value .",
    "typically , this offset is approximately @xmath124 since the signal and idler photon numbers are usually identical in the absence of loss .",

    "note that these two measurements act as a simple method for acquiring the input number of photons independent of the parametric gain .",
    "a measurement of the signal photon - number @xmath145 can be easily acquired by measuring the output idler intensities in the same way .",

    "the broad bandwidth is obtained by closely matching the pump wavelength to the zero - dispersion of the fiber at @xmath160 nm @xcite , resulting in a signal and idler bandwidth of @xmath161thz each , with @xmath162thz mean frequency separation between the mode centers ( 700 nm - signal center , and 900 nm - idler center ) .",
    "after generation , the pump is separated from the fwm field into a different optical path by a narrowband filter ( nbf1 - semrock nf03 - 808e-25 ) , allowing independent control of the relative pump phase .",
    "the pump phase is activley locked to the phase of the fwm using an electro - optic modulator and a fast feedback loop .",
    "both the fwm and pump fields are reflected back ( mirrors m1 , m2 ) towards the pcf for a second pass , which then acts as the homodyne measurement .",
    "the final parametric amplified spectrum ( after the second `` homodyne '' pass ) is filtered from the pump ( nbf2 - semrock nf03 - 785e-25 ) and measured with a cooled ccd - spectrograph ( spectrapro 2300i ) .",

    "generation of broadband squeezed light ( propagating from left to right ) and then 2 .",
    "homodyne measurement of the generated squeezing ( propagating back from right to left ) .",
    "broadband two - mode squeezed light is generated via spontaneous four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in a photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) pumped by 12ps laser pulses ( @xmath163 ) ( collimated at the output with a parabolic mirror prm ) .",
    "after generation , the pump and the fwm are separated into two paths by a narrow - band filter ( nbf1 ) allowing the pump phase and polarization to be tuned independently .",
    "both pump and fwm are reflected back by folding mirrors ( m1 , m2 ) for a second pass through the pcf , now acting as a measuring device .",
    "the specific fwm quadrature to be amplified is selected by tuning the pump phase , and the amplification gain is controlled by manipulation of the pump polarization using the half and quarter wave plates ( hwp , qwp ) before the fiber and after it .",
    "after the 2nd ( measurement ) pass through the pcf the fwm field is separated from the pump by a narrow - band filter ( nbf2 ) and directed towards a ccd - spectrograph , where the amplified spectrum is measured.,width=325 ]    in order to partially compensate for the temporal pulse effects due to spm of the pulsed pump , we used the original pump pulse from the first pass through the pcf also for the second pass .",
    "this guaranteed that the pump and the fwm accumulated nearly the same phase modulation ( either spm for the pump or xpm for the fwm light ) .",
    "polarization manipulations were used to tune the effective parametric gain in the second ( measurement ) pass independently of the squeezing strength in the first pass : since the phase matching conditions in the pcf are polarization dependent , the observed fwm spectrum is generated only by one polarization of the pump ( this fact was extensively verified ) .",
    "thus , rotating the pump polarization before the first pass with a half wave plate ( hwp ) we could transfer part of the pump power through the fiber without affecting the fwm .",
    "this power could later be used in the 2nd pass by rotating its polarization back to the pcf axis with a quarter wave plate ( qwp ) in the pump beam path .",
    "this extra pump power accumulated almost the same phase modulation as the fwm , but without affecting the squeezing generation .",
    "the various calibration measurements were performed by manipulating the fwm light between the passes either by physically blocking the fwm beam ( vacuum input ) or pump beam ( zero amplification ) or with a high efficiency optical long - pass filter ( idler input only ) ( semrock ff776-dio1 ) .",
    "the two orthogonal homodyne measurements ( amplifying the squeezed quadrature or the stretched quadrature ) were acquired by tuning the offset of the active feedback loop that locked the pump phase .      in our experiment",
    "the pump for both generation of the squeezed light and for the parametric homodyne measurement ( 2nd pass ) , is a pulsed laser of @xmath164ps duration ( a more detailed experimental configuration is shown in figure [ homodynesetup - actual ] ) .",
    "since the bandwidth of the generated fwm ( @xmath1thz ) is much larger than the pump bandwidth ( @xmath165thz ) we could account for the main affect of the pulse shape as an adiabatic variation of the parametric gain and phase modulation ( spm , xpm ) along the temporal profile of the pump pulse .",
    "thus , the adiabatic variation can be discretized in time , referring to time instances within a single pulse as separate parametric events of varying gain and phase .",
    "however , since the integration time of the photodetectors in the ccd - spectrograph is much longer ( @xmath166ms ) , the measured homodyne data is averaged over the entire shape of many pulses .",
    "the effect of the pulse on the parametric gain alone changes the generated squeezing and the measurement gain with time , measuring weak squeezing with weak parametric gain at the edges of the pulse , and strong squeezing with strong parametric gain at the peak .",
    "the phase modulation ( spm , xpm ) of the fwm process has a more severe effect , since it modulates _ in time _ the quadrature axis to be amplified . as a result , due to the pump pulse shape",
    ", the amplified quadrature axis of the fwm field rotates with time .",
    "luckily , when the pump itself experiences nearly the same phase modulation ( spm ) it can still act as a near perfect lo ( phase regarding ) for measuring the fwm , even after passage through the fiber .",
    "the small residual difference between the pump spm and the fwm xpm causes the amplified fwm quadrature to rotate with time , mixing different quadrature axes together in the same measurement , smearing out some of the squeezing .",
    "ideally , we would like to extract the maximum squeezing that occures at the peak of the pulse from the time averaged measurements . to estimate this peak squeezing",
    "we numarically simulated the entire fwm generation and parametric amplification along the pump pulse with @xmath167fs temporal resolution ( corresponding to the coherence time of the fwm ) .",
    "the simulation incorporated the measured pump pulse energy , the measured loss and fiber coupling efficiencies , and an assumed hyperbolic - secant temporal shape of the pump pulse ( 12ps ) . using the simulation we could calculate both the average and the peak outputs of the process , allowing us to estimate the squeezing at the peak of the pulse from the measured averaged homodyne output .",
    "figure [ paragainsweep ] ( in the supplementary information ) demonstrates the relation between the peak homodyne output and the average homodyne output , as the parametric measurement gain is varied . as long as the generation pump power does not exceed a specific limit ( @xmath168mw in our experiment ) , the pulse averaging only affects the absolute measured squeezing values ( which can be roughly estimated ) but not the expected trends of the experiment ( increasing the loss , the squeezing power or the parametric power ) .",
    "another important verification of our squeezing measurement is to observe the effect of loss on the measured quadrature squeezing and stretching .",
    "we measured the quadrature intensities after applying a set of known attenuations ( @xmath170 loss ) , and reconstructed the bare quadratures before loss , which indeed collapsed to the same value , as shown in figure [ homodyneresults ] ( c , d ) ( in the supplementary information ) .",

    "further increase of the pump degrades the observed squeezing due to temporal effects of the pulsed pump .",

    "this convergence of the relative output ( dots ) ( @xmath180 ) approached a constant level of @xmath181 below the vacuum level .",
    "when the measurement gain is reduced , the relative output decreases due to a quantum interference effect , reaching maximum visibility when the squeezing generation gain is equal to the measurement gain ( @xmath182 ) . in this regime , the general measurement becomes indirect ( although the squeezing effect is still directly evident ) , and a pair of measurements ( amplifying one quadrature and then the other ) is needed for extracting the quadrature information . below the level of identical",
    "gain , the observed output strongly rises over the vacuum level , obscuring the direct evidence of squeezing ; however , the quadrature information can still be extracted ( though with reduced accuracy ) using the same pair of measurements .",

    ", we included the simulated result for the relative output at the peak of the pulse ( dashed green).,width=325 ]    the effect of loss on the quadrature intensity can be regarded as propagation through a beam - splitter with one open port .",
    "the relations between the operators of the two inputs ( @xmath183 ) and two outputs ( @xmath184 ) of the beam - splitter can be defined as @xmath185 and @xmath186 , where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the transmission and reflection ( loss ) amplitudes . in these terms , the quadrature operator at output port @xmath189 is : @xmath190 , and the expectation value of the quadrature intensity is @xmath191 assuming a vacuum state at the open input port @xmath192 , the final expression becomes ; @xmath193 hence , the bare quadratures , before the loss , can be reconstructed using @xmath194    as a complementary evaluation , we studied the parametric measurement - amplifier output as a function of its own gain , while maintaining the squeezing generation gain constant . for this , we gradually increased the pump power in the second pass up to 5.5 times the pump power that generated the squeezing in the first pass . when the parametric gain is strong enough , the output intensity relative to the vacuum level ( without input ) is directly proportional to the input quadrature .",
    "hence , we expect the relative - output to stabilize as the parametric gain is increased , and indeed the observed reduction below the vacuum level stabilized at @xmath195 .",

    "<S> . this broadband parametric homodyne measurement opens a wide window for parallel processing of quantum information @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is standard practice to express the field of nearly monochromatic light @xmath2 , as a superposition of two quadrature oscillations : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the real quadrature amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> while this separation is just a mathematical convenience in classical electromagnetism , it is of fundamental importance in quantum optics , since the quadratures are a conjugate pair of non - commuting observables ( @xmath6\\!=\\!2i$ ] ) that obeys quantum uncertainty ( @xmath7 ) , just like position and momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this conjugation is most emphasized with squeezed light , where the uncertainty of one quadrature of the field is reduced ( squeezed ) , while the uncertainty of the other is inevitably increased ( stretched ) @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> although formally , generalization of the quadrature description to a broadband time - dependent field using time - dependent quadratures @xmath9 is direct , the homodyne method for measuring the quadratures inherently distinguishes between a nearly monochromatic field and a broadband field . </S>",
    "<S> what distinguishes between the two cases is the mhz to ghz electronic bandwidth of standard homodyne detection . in the near monochromatic case , the instantaneous quadrature amplitudes vary slowly over millions of optical cycles , and can be directly observed through the time dependent electrical signal of the homodyne photo - detectors . however , in the case of broadband light , the response of the photo - detectors is too slow to follow the rapid variations of the quadrature amplitudes , which can easily be at optical frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> broadband signals require therefore an inherently different measuring technique .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct mathematical relation between the broadband quadrature amplitudes and the field is simple and illuminating in both time and frequency , and yet , it is rarely used outside the context of near monochromatic light . defining the field as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 the complex field amplitude ) , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath33 where @xmath34,@xmath35 are the standard single mode quadratures of the signal and idler modes .    to measure the field quadratures , </S>",
    "<S> the optical signal should be compared against a strong and coherent quadrature reference ( local oscillator - lo ) , where the specific quadrature to be measured is dictated by tuning the lo phase . </S>",
    "<S> hence , at the heart of a homodyne detector are an external lo and a field multiplier . in the radio - frequency ( rf ) domain , for instance , the input radio - wave is directly multiplied with the lo using an rf frequency mixer . in optics , however , direct frequency mixers do not exist and standard optical homodyne relies on a beam splitter to superpose the optical input and the lo ( see inset of figure [ bothhomodyne ] ) and on the _ nonlinear electrical response _ of square - law photo - detectors to multiply the two fields and generate an _ electronic signal _ proportional to the measured @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the use of square - law photo - detectors as a homodyne multiplier inherently limits the observable time variations of the quadratures to the electronically accessible photo - detector bandwidth of mhz to ghz range . </S>",
    "<S> the detection is also strongly affected by the detectors quantum efficiency and spectral noise , which lead to equivalent decoherence and additional vacuum noise @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the time dependent description of the two - mode quadratures in equations [ modulatedquad],[complexquadamp ] is thus inconvenient for standard homodyne with broadband light , since it can not be related directly to measurable quantities . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the common expression for the two - mode quadratures relies on equation [ realimquadamp ] , using the individual quadratures of the signal and idler modes , @xmath36 relative to two correlated los at their respective frequencies @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to measure two - mode quadratures and squeezing , the standard procedure requires two homodyne measurements of the independent quadratures of both the signal and the idler using a pair of phase - correlated los , followed by low - noise subtraction / summation circuitry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> standard two - mode homodyne however , can not provide a complete measurement of @xmath38 in a single shot . since standard homodyne is a destructive measurement , observation of @xmath39 requires a standard homodyne measurement of both frequency modes , which inevitably destroys the quantum state by photo - detection and prevents consecutive measurement of @xmath40 . splitting the state into two measurement channels </S>",
    "<S> is also impossible since splitting introduces additional vacuum noise . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although @xmath41 and @xmath42 commute , standard two - mode homodyne can evaluate only one of them in a single shot , which indicates that it can provide the complete quadrature information _ only when the phase of the two - mode beat envelope is known and fixed_. for two - mode squeezed vacuum however , which is the major quantum state that is experimentally accessible in two - mode , the envelope phase is random , indicating that standard homodyne can provide only the average fluctuations @xmath43 , but not the single shot value of the quadrature ( or its intensity ) .    with standard two - mode homodyne , each frequency pair of a broadband spectrum requires a homodyne measurement with a separate pair of los . in principle </S>",
    "<S> however , a single lo should be sufficient to measure the entire spectrum of mode pairs simultaneously , just as all mode pairs of broadband squeezed light can be generated with a single pump laser . </S>",
    "<S> to achieve such direct parallel detection over the entire bandwidth , we suggest to exploit a _ direct broadband optical nonlinearity _ to multiply the fields , instead of the indirect narrowband electronic nonlinearity of photo - detectors .    we present a different approach to the two - mode homodyne ( see figure [ bothhomodyne ] ) , based on broadband optical parametric amplification , which amplifies one quadrature of the input light and attenuates the other ( normally used as the major method to generate squeezed vacuum ) . with sufficient parametric gain , </S>",
    "<S> any given @xmath4 quadrature at the input , even if it was originally squeezed , can be amplified above the vacuum noise level and into the `` classical regime '' , which allows _ complete freedom in measurement _ since quantum vacuum fluctuations are no longer a limiting noise source . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the gain is high enough for the amplified quadrature to dominate the intensity of the output light over the attenuated orthogonal @xmath5 quadrature , measurement of the light intensity at the output will reflect directly a single - shot value of the input quadrature intensity @xmath44 ( as illustrated in figure [ bothhomodyne ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , the concept of parametric homodyne is easily understood in the limit of large parametric gain , where the quadrature of interest dominates the output light field . however </S>",
    "<S> , parametric homodyne method is equally effective in almost any finite parametric gain . </S>",
    "<S> although the output intensity with finite gain does not directly reflect the quadrature intensity , it provides equivalent information about the quadrature , as explained below and in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , two average intensity measurements , one for each quadrature , allows to uniquely reconstruct both average quadrature intensities .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that the measurement parametric amplifier is not necessarily required to be an ideal squeezer . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , since the attenuated quadrature is not measured , it does not need to be squeezed below vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , restrictions on the measurement amplifier are considerably relaxed compared to a source of squeezed light , allowing it to operate with much higher gain . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric amplification is a _ non - demolition _ </S>",
    "<S> process that provides _ a light output _ , which allows extraction of the _ complete quadrature information_. in the experiment below , we measured the quadrature intensity across a wide spectrum , but in principle , also the quadrature phase could be obtained from the output light . </S>",
    "<S> since the amplified quadrature is nearly insensitive to loss even for moderate gain , it can be split after the parametric amplification to two simultaneous homodyne channels , allowing measurement of both @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting will not hamper the measurement ( contrary to standard homodyne ) , since the added vacuum affects primarily the attenuated quadrature , which is not measured .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to examine standard homodyne measurement as a form of parametric amplification . </S>",
    "<S> after all , balanced photo - detection produces a down - converted rf field at the difference - frequency between the two optical inputs ( lo and signal ) , similar to optical down - conversion - the core of parametric amplification . in that view , balanced detection produces photon - electron entanglement , similar to the entangled bi - photons produced by a parametric amplifier ; and the well known homodyne gain , which enhances the electronic signal above the electronic noise ( proportional to the lo amplitude ) , is analogous to the parametric gain , which enhances the optical quadrature above the vacuum noise . </S>",
    "<S> the main differences are that photo - detection destroys the optical fields , whereas the optical nonlinearity preserves them , allowing _ non - demolition manipulations _ ; and that the homodyne gain of the balanced detection is normally high enough to safely neglect the unmeasured quadrature , which can not be assumed a - priori for the optical case . </S>",
    "<S> clearly therefore , adding a layer of parametric gain before the photo - detection ( homodyne or direct intensity ) , can convert the electronic part of the measurement to be nearly classical , thereby alleviating most of the electronic limitations .    in our experiment , we measured the output spectrum of the parametric amplifier for an input of broadband squeezed vacuum , obtaining the quadrature intensity @xmath47 simultaneously across the entire bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> although such a measurement of the spectral intensity loses the quadrature phase ( or the sign of the real / imaginary parts ) , it is still highly useful , since it provides sufficient information to measure any quantum state whose quadrature probability distribution is symmetric , which is relevant to a large set of important quantum states , such as fock - states , squeezed vacuum and symmetric schrdinger cat - states . </S>",
    "<S> for broadband squeezed vacuum , where the envelope phase is of no interest ( random ) , this measurement is ideal .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , our method relies on the similarity between the quadrature operators of interest from equation [ complexquadamp ] @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the field amplitude operators at the output of a parametric amplifier , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the parametric gain coefficients that fulfil @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the squeezing gain set by the efficiency of the nonlinear process ( the common form is @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . </S>",

    "<S> xe^g$ ] or @xmath59{}\\ ! </S>",
    "<S> y^{\\dag}e^g$ ] , depending on the pump phase . </S>",
    "<S> although the field operator converges to the quadrature only in the limit of high gain , its relation to the to the quadrature operators is unique and informative at any finite gain , allowing reconstruction of the quadratures . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the field - quadrature relation for finite gain is described in the supplementary information .        before dwelling into the experimental measurement of broadband squeezing , </S>",
    "<S> let us elaborate on the importance of broadband squeezed vacuum @xcite as a resource for quantum information , and on the potential to exploit broadband squeezing detection for highly parallel quantum processing . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , a very large bandwidth of symmetrically separated frequency pairs can be generated simultaneously from a single parametric amplifier with a single narrowband pump laser , which can potentially serve as parallel quantum modes ( q - modes ) in a quantum processing application @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing bandwidth of a parametric amplifier is limited only by its phase matching and can easily extend over a full optical octave , either by chirped polling of the non - linear medium @xcite , or by matching of the pump frequency to the zero - dispersion of the medium @xcite . assuming a squeezing bandwidth of 10 - 100thz ( common ) </S>",
    "<S> , the number of simultaneous mode - pairs can easily exceed @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> two examples can illuminate the great potential of broad bandwidth in quantum information on one hand , and the difficulty of standard methods to exploit it on the other . </S>",
    "<S> a most promising realization for scalable quantum information is to exploit the bandwidth of entangled q - modes of a quantum frequency comb that is generated by a single parametric oscillator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach demonstrated to date the largest entangled clusters of q - modes and a complete set of quantum gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting factor of this realization is the homodyne measurement bandwidth , where each q - mode required a precise homodyne measurement using a pair of phase - correlated los . </S>",
    "<S> a broad bandwidth of q - modes would require a dense set of correlated los and multiple homodyne measurements , quickly multiplying the complexity towards impracticality . </S>",
    "<S> another example is in quantum communication and qkd , where enhanced bandwidth was pursued as an avenue to increase the data rate by increasing the number of bits per photon . here </S>",
    "<S> , the concept is to divide the photon readout time , which is limited by photo - detectors , into multiple short time - bins , which act as an additional time stamp for each photon ( or pair ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time stamp ( bin ) , which is usually detected using a franson interferometer @xcite , enhances the number of bits per photon to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the number of time - bins . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , if the bandwidth limit of the detector could be lifted , all time ( or frequency ) bins could be detected independently , and a much higher flux of photons could be used ( @xmath62 times higher ) . </S>",
    "<S> this would allow full parallelization of the communication across the available bandwidth and enhancement of the total throughput by factor @xmath62 ( compared to @xmath61 ) .    here </S>",
    "<S> we exploit for the parametric homodyne measurement the same non - linearity and the same pump that were used to generate the squeezed state in the first place , thus guaranteeing a bandwidth match between the homodyne measurement and the input squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrature information over many frequency pairs is obtained simultaneously by measuring the spectrum of the light at the output of the parametric amplifier , which would allow extreme parallel processing . since each individual mode - pair </S>",
    "<S> is measured independently with just a single lo - the pump , the number of accessible q - modes ( or q - bits ) that could be utilized simultaneously would be multiplied by @xmath62 ( the number of modes ) rather than @xmath63 .    the experimental concept to demonstrate broadband parametric homodyne ( see figure [ homodynesetup - concept ] ) , consists of two parts : first , generation of broadband squeezed vacuum , and second , parametric homodyne detection of the generated squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we generate broadband squeezed vacuum by collinear four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in a photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) that is pumped by narrowband picosecond pulses . to measure the generated squeezing , we couple the generated fwm together with the pump to another pcf which acts as a measurement amplifier ( in the experiment this was the same pcf in the backward direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the second ( measurement ) pass we record the parametric output spectrum to extract the quadrature information ( shown in figure [ measurementprocess ] ( a ) ) . since squeezed vacuum is a gaussian state , its quadrature distribution is completely defined by the second moment . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore measure the average spectral intensity ( with averaging times of a few 10s of milliseconds ) and reconstruct the average quadrature fluctuations @xmath64,@xmath65 ( measurement of the intensity distribution is possible with shorter integration time , but not necessary for squeezed vacuum ) . </S>",
    "<S> already the raw output spectrum demonstrates reduction of the parametric output _ below the vacuum noise - level _ ( defined as the parametric output when the input is blocked ) across the entire @xmath1thz , directly indicating broadband squeezing . to verify this </S>",
    "<S> , we varied the quadrature squeezing by varying the loss of the input fwm field before the measurement ( second ) pass through the pcf . as the loss </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the squeezing slowly vanishes , and even though the total power entering the fiber diminished , the minimum fringes at the output of the measurement amplifier rose towards the vacuum input level , as shown in the inset of figure [ measurementprocess ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> more details of the experimental apparatus can be found in the supplementary information .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) * the parametric homodyne measurement process * includes three stages - raw output measurement ( a ) , calibration ( b ) and quadrature extraction ( c ) . * ( a ) * raw output measurements - in the most general case of arbitrary parametric gain , two measurements are needed to extract the quadrature information : 1 . </S>",

    "<S> quadrature squeezing is evident across the entire @xmath1thz spectrum down to @xmath69 , @xmath70 below the vacuum level ( @xmath71).,width=325 ]    due to chromatic dispersion in the filters and windows used in the experiment , the accumulated phase between the fwm and the pump varied across the spectrum , indicating that for some frequencies the stretched quadrature is amplified ( bright fringes ) while for others the squeezed quadrature is amplified ( relatively dark fringes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the specific quadrature to be amplified could be controlled by varying the pump phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the extraction of the quadrature information from the measured parametric output assumes knowledge of the parametric gain of the measurement amplifier , which requires calibration of the parametric amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration is a simple process , achieved by recording the output spectrum for a set of known inputs ( figure [ measurementprocess ] ( b ) ) , when blocking various fields ( signal , idler or pump ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example : the vacuum level of the parametric amplifier is observed when both the signal and the idler input fields are blocked ( @xmath67 - zero signal idler ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , the average number of photons at the input is given by the ratio between the measured output with blocked signal ( idler only , @xmath66 - zero signal ) and the vacuum input level @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this calibration process is fully described in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric homodyne results in figure [ measurementprocess ] ( c ) show @xmath73db squeezing across the entire @xmath1thz bandwidth . to obtain a homodyne measurement across such a large bandwidth with standard homodyne detection would be practically impossible .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed squeezing in our experiment is far from ideal , primarily due to use of a pulsed pump , which induces an undesirable time dependence of the parametric gain and phase ( via self - phase and cross - phase modulation - spm and xpm ) in the squeezing process , as well as in the parametric homodyne measurement . since </S>",
    "<S> our pulses are relatively long , their time dependence can be regarded as adiabatic , indicating that the instantaneous squeezing ( source ) and the parametric amplification ( measurement ) are ideal , but the quadrature axis , squeezing level and gain of each one vary with time ( not necessarily at the same rate ) . thus , our spectral measurements , which represent a temporal average of the light intensity over the entire pulse , somewhat dim the `` expected '' squeezing </S>",
    "<S> . however , even with a pulsed pump , the various homodyne and calibration measurements are consistent and unequivocal for weak enough pump intensity ( see further elaboration regarding the effects of pulse averaging in the supplementary information ) . with a pure cw pump , as is generally used in squeezing applications , this pulse averaging limitation would not exist . </S>",
    "<S> another limitation of our measurements is the need to re - couple the fwm back into the pcf , which introduces an inevitable loss of @xmath74 and reduces the observed squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> this `` known '' loss can either be avoided completely in other experimental configurations or be easily calibrated out to obtain a worst - case `` bare '' squeezing level of the measured light source ( see supplementary information ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we verified the properties of the parametric homodyne in several ways , which are shown in figures [ homodyneresults ] and [ paragainsweep ] in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the squeezed quadrature @xmath75 , and the uncertainty area , @xmath76 of the squeezed state . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , the generated squeezed light should be a minimum uncertainly state of @xmath77 , independent of the generation gain ; and the average intensity of the squeezed quadrature should exponentially decrease with the gain . </S>",
    "<S> the results , presented in figure [ homodyneresults ] ( a - b ) of the supplementary information , show a clear reduction of the normalized squeezed quadrature intensity down to @xmath78 ( @xmath70 below the vacuum level ) , and the uncertainty area remains nearly ideal at @xmath79 , up to a pump power of 60mw . </S>",
    "<S> further increase of the pump does not improve the measured squeezing due to pulse effects , and the minimum uncertainty property deteriorated . based on the measured squeezing , the instantaneous squeezed quadrature at the peak of the pulse </S>",
    "<S> was estimated to be better than @xmath80 ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> additional verification measurements of the homodyne process are presented in the supplementary information and in figures [ homodyneresults ] ( c - d ) and [ paragainsweep ] in the supplementary information .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , the effect of two parametric amplifiers in series was explored in the context of quantum interference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a series configuration , interference occurs between two possibilities for generating bi - photons , either in the first amplifier or in the second , depending on the pump phase . </S>",
    "<S> the interference contrast can reach unity when the parametric gain of the two amplifiers is _ identical _ ( assuming no loss ) , which testifies to the quantum nature of the light in both the single - photon regime @xcite and at high - power @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> however , we consider the second amplifier as a measurement device , independent of the source of light to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> the source of light can be , but is certainly not limited to be , a squeezing parametric amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , any other source of quantum light is relevant when homodyne measurement is of interest , such as single photons , fock states , noon states , schrdinger cat states , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> a different optical measurement of quantum light was recently reported in @xcite , where vacuum fluctuations of thz radiation were observed _ in time_. there too , an optical nonlinearity ( of several thz bandwidth ) was utilized for a direct measurement , where the large bandwidth of the nonlinearity was key to enable time sampling of the vacuum fluctuations , well within a single optical - cycle of the measured thz mode .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we presented a new approach to optical homodyne measurement with practically unlimited bandwidth , which is based on optical parametric amplification and enables simultaneous quadrature measurement across an unlimited spectrum of two - mode light using a single lo . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement removes a major limitation of optical homodyne and opens a wide window for efficient utilization of the bandwidth resource for parallel quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting expansion of this concept would be where the pump itself includes more than one mode , for measurement of `` hyper '' entanglement between different frequency pairs of the frequency comb with a multi - mode pump @xcite .    </S>",
