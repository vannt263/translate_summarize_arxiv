    "the stochastic alpha , beta , rho ( sabr ) model is defined by the following system of stochastic differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 and where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath4-correlated brownian motions on a filtered probability space @xmath5 with parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] and state space @xmath9 .",
    "it describes the dynamics of a forward rate @xmath10 with cev - type ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.4 ) ) dynamics and a stochastic volatility @xmath11 .",
    "the sabr model was introduced by hagan et .",
    "al in @xcite in the early 2000 s and is today benchmark in interest rate markets @xcite . during its decade and a half of existence , the sabr model has changed the daily routine of interest rate modelling due to a particularly tractable formula ( the so - called sabr formula ) for the implied volatility .",
    "this has led to the formula rather than the model itself becoming an industry standard . today",
    "it is known @xcite that the celebrated sabr formula is prone to yield inconsistent prices around zero interest rates , but the model itself can produce consistent prices when appropriate pricing methods are used . in the historically low interest - rate environments of the past years this has become increasingly relevant and spurred research both among practitioners and academics . from an academic perspective , the concrete but delicate examples of sabr - type models exhibit several advantageous but also certain challenging properties .",
    "we review here some regularity properties of this family of processes with a view to different option pricing approaches . + as a starting point we study the applications of a time change that partially decouples the equations and allows to relate sabr to a cev model running on a stochastic clock .",
    "the first time - change applied to sabr appeared in the original work @xcite as a rescaling . there",
    "the volatility of volatility , as a scaling parameter of time , was key  via singular perturbation  to derive the tractable asymptotic formula which made the model popular .",
    "later on in @xcite , a further time change was proposed for the sabr model , where not only the volatility of volatility , but the entire volatility path is absorbed into the ( now random ) rescaling of time .",
    "time change arguments of this type are standard and appear in different contexts in the finance literature , for example in @xcite and @xcite in a general setup and in @xcite in the context of the sabr model .",
    "the geometric viewpoint on the sabr model was put forward in @xcite and in the monograph @xcite , drawing the link between a _ normal _ ( @xmath12 ) sabr model and brownian motion on a hyperbolic plane .",
    "it provides a technique to re - derive the original singular perturbation expansion of hagan et al . via heat kernel techiques",
    "these are applied to brownian motion on a suitably chosen manifold ( the sabr plane , cf .",
    "@xcite ) combined with a simpler  regular  perturbation .",
    "this geometric insight further promoted the integration of tools from stochastic analysis on manifolds @xcite into the context of mathematical finance .",
    "it also initiated refinements of the initial hagan expansion , which appeared to lack accuracy in the vicinity of the origin , by refining the leading order @xcite and providing a second order term @xcite .",
    "although the viewpoint on the state space of the sabr process as a riemannian manifold appears to be well suited to characterize the absolutely continuous part of the distribution when @xmath13 , it potentially breaks down at the origin ( for values @xmath14 of the cev parameter ) . as a result , riemannian heat kernel expansion techniques applied to sabr can yield erroneous values in the vicinity of @xmath15 already in leading order .",
    "although several celebrated results for asymptotic expansions beyond the riemannian ( elliptic ) setup are available ",
    "see for example @xcite for hypoelliptic diffusions ",
    "these however are not applicable to sabr , due to the its delicate degeneracy .",
    "the literature on short - time asymptotics for degenerate diffusions beyond the hypoelliptic setup is scarce . in certain cases ,",
    "the machinery of symmetric dirichlet forms @xcite is suitable for such short - time asymptotic expansions .",
    "motivated by this , we establish here dirichlet forms for sabr and related processes for a suitable subset of parameter configurations . + the paper is organized as follows : we review the time change in @xcite and suggest a perspective on it as a transformation of the underlying geometry of the state space of the processes . as applications we prove regularity properties and point out certain irregularities of the sabr model and related processes ( sections 2 and 3 ) .",
    "proofs can be found in appendix [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "+ as a first application we propose ( in section 2 ) a simple method to prove the feller - dynkin property of the sabr process .",
    "feller(-dynkin ) processes and feller semigroups have a rich theory with an interest of its own , see for instance @xcite . however , our main interests in feller - dynkin properties are motivated from a numerical point of view : in @xcite monte carlo methods are proposed under the feller - dynkin assumption .",
    "furthermore , general convergence theory as developed in hansen , ostermann @xcite provides a framework , where splitting schemes with optimal convergence orders can be constructed .",
    "the applicability of their results to the sabr model requires the considered semigroup to be a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on a suitable banach space .",
    "feller properties are needed to show strong continuity in these banach spaces .",
    "+ although the feller - dynkin property is well studied in different contexts , available standard results are not applicable to sabr : for example the assumptions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 21.11 and 23.16 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) are violated .",
    "further methods to derive feller properties under rather general conditions were proposed in @xcite .",
    "these conditions however are also violated by sabr .",
    "therefore , we propose an approach to derive feller - dynkin properties , which applies to sabr - type processes and to a wider class of stochastic models . furthermore , since from a financial perspective it is desirable to consider payoff functions with unbounded growth , we also derive so - called _ generalized feller properties _",
    "@xcite ) for the considered processes .",
    "+ having determined banach spaces on which the semigroups of sabr - type processes are strongly continuous ( section 2.1 ) , we turn to the regularity of these semigroups on hilbert spaces ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "we construct weighted @xmath16 -spaces , on which we can associate a strongly continuous symmetric semigroup to these processes .",
    "furthermore , we determine all classes of parameter configurations , for which the symmetry property of the resulting dirichlet forms is not violated .",
    "in particular , we highlight that apart from the special cases of parameter combinations where either @xmath12 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , sabr - dirichlet forms are generically not symmetric on any weighted @xmath16 -space . + as a further application of the time change we characterize ( in section 3 ) the asymptotic behavior of the sabr process and of some related processes for short- and large - time horizons . to study the large time behavior of the sabr process ( section [ sec : asymptoticslargetime ] ) we write the sabr process as a time change of a simpler process ",
    "the cev process  for which the asymptotic behaviour is well known .",
    "if the time change does not level off , then the cev process reaches its @xmath20 limit and hence the sabr process hits zero .",
    "otherwise , the sabr process has a non - trivial limit behavior since it is the position of the cev process at a finite random time . in @xcite similar results",
    "are derived for special cases .",
    "we pursue this line of argumentation for general values of the parameter @xmath21 in the uncorrelated sabr model and for brownian motion on the sabr plane .",
    "the perspective of the time change as a transformation of the underlying geometry allows us to relate the large time behavior of the latter to correlated euclidean brownian motions .",
    "+ we emphasize the scope of applications of dirichlet forms by commenting ( section [ sec : asymptoticsshorttime ] ) on the short time behavior of a diffusion closely related to the cev process , for which varadhan - type asymptotics fail in the parameter regime @xmath22 , see @xcite .",
    "the geometry induced ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) by the respective dirichlet forms corresponding to the processes seems to better reflect the behavior of this process near the singularities than classical riemannian geometry .",
    "while in riemannian geometry the distance between two points is determined  via the eikonal equation  by the gradient along a ( length - minimizing ) geodesic curve connecting them , in the dirichlet geometry this gradient is replaced by an appropriate energy measure . finally , we conclude by calculating the energy measures for the sabr and cev dirichlet forms and observing that the time - change transforms the `` dirichlet geometry '' analogously to the riemannian case .",
    "a crucial observation for the time change arguments we study here is that the generator of the sabr model factorizes as @xmath23 for an operator @xmath24 , where @xmath25 acts as a multiplicative perturbation .",
    "the martingale problem for the operator @xmath24 ( we recall it in the appendix , ) is solved by the law of a process with dynamics @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the multiplicative perturbation of generators emphasizes ( cf .",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem vi.3.7 ) ) the following well - known relationship between the processes and :    [ th : timechangedsabrvolkonskii ] let the law of the process @xmath30 be a solution of .",
    "then the following processes coincide in law with the sabr process",
    "@xmath31 : @xmath32 where the time change is defined as @xmath33 up to the hitting time @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the law of is a solution of the martingale problem for @xmath35 in .",
    "the time change for sabr appears in several related works , for example in @xcite .",
    "there is a clear advantage in studying sabr from the point of view of theorems [ th : timechangedsabrvolkonskii ] . in the full coupling in the coefficients",
    "is removed and put into the time change .",
    "an important feature of the sabr time change is that it only involves the second coordinate processes @xmath11 and @xmath36 and therefore some important calculations can be handled .",
    "indeed , it is nothing but the time change of a brownian motion into a geometric brownian motion .",
    "furthermore , the time change is a continuous additive functional of brownian motion and as such it has a representation as a ( unique ) mixture of brownian local times ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 22.25 ) .",
    "this suggests a perspective on the time change as a transformation of the underlying geometry , cf .",

    "[ rem : geompersplocaltime ] by the time change one changes the time that a particle spends in a small neighborhood @xmath37 of a point @xmath38 .",
    "an alternative perspective is to define a new geometry ( intrinsic metric or ",
    "energy \" metric ) in a way to match the speed of the particle : points where the particle moves slowly are  far away  ( intervals are stretched ) and points , where the particle moves quickly are  close \" ( intervals are compressed ) in the energy metric .",
    "this is well illustrated in the special case ( @xmath12 , @xmath18 ) of the sabr model by observing in theorem [ th : timechangedsabrvolkonskii ] the time changed brownian process @xmath39 in the geometry of the hyperbolic plane : the time - changed brownian particle moves slowly where @xmath36 is small , hence the speed measure is large .",

    "<S> the sabr model is a benchmark stochastic volatility model in interest rate markets , which has received much attention in the past decade . </S>",
    "<S> its popularity arose from a tractable asymptotic expansion for implied volatility , derived by heat kernel methods . </S>",
    "<S> as markets moved to historically low rates , this expansion appeared to yield inconsistent prices . </S>",
    "<S> since the model is deeply embedded in market practice , alternative pricing methods for sabr have been addressed in numerous approaches in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> all standard option pricing methods make certain regularity assumptions on the underlying model , but for sabr these are rarely satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> we examine here regularity properties of the model from this perspective with view to a number of ( asymptotic and numerical ) option pricing methods . in particular , we highlight delicate degeneracies of the sabr model ( and related processes ) at the origin , which deem the currently used popular heat kernel methods and all related methods from ( sub- )  riemannian geometry ill - suited for sabr - type processes , when interest rates are near zero . we describe a more general semigroup framework , which permits to derive a suitable geometry for sabr - type processes ( in certain parameter regimes ) via symmetric dirichlet forms . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive regularity properties ( feller- properties and strong continuity properties ) necessary for the applicability of popular numerical schemes to sabr - semigroups , and identify suitable banach- and hilbert spaces for these . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we comment on the short time and large time asymptotic behaviour of sabr - type processes beyond the heat - kernel framework . </S>"
