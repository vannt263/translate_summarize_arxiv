    "the surprising quantum oscillations ( qo ) in both hole  @xcite and electron doped cuprates  @xcite have raised an important question concerning the ground state of high temperature superconductors  @xcite . applied magnetic field between @xmath4 t has been argued to quench the superconducting fluctuations , at least to a large degree , revealing the normal state .",
    "this is not surprising in electron doped @xmath5 ( ncco ) , where the upper critical field @xmath6 is less than @xmath7 , but is somewhat surprising in hole doped cuprates where @xmath6 is extrapolated to be of order @xmath8 or greater  @xcite .",
    "one of the striking recent findings is the observation of multiple quantum oscillation frequencies  @xcite . to understand qo in hole doped @xmath0 ( ybco ) and stoichiometric @xmath9 ( y124 ) , we shall follow a reasoning based on broken translational symmetry with perhaps an unconventional order parameter , @xmath10-density wave ( ddw )  @xcite .",
    "the observed multiple frequencies should not only impose constraints on the theoretical models but also interpretation of experiments , as discussed recently  @xcite .",
    "superficially similar results can be obtained within a mean field approximation using a spin density wave ( sdw ) theory , but we favour singlet ddw for numerous reasons discussed elsewhere  @xcite . more importantly , the quasiparticles of a singlet ddw have charge-@xmath11 , spin-@xmath12 , and a @xmath13-factor renormalized by residual fermi liquid corrections . in the simplest treatment given here , we set @xmath14 .",
    "this characterization of the quasiparticles is consistent with a very recent measurement and its precise analysis  @xcite and perhaps eliminates any triplet order parameter , such as sdw or triplet ddw .",
    "not only do the experiments involving multiple quantum oscillation frequencies indicate formation of landau levels signifying finite quasiparticle residues even in underdoped cuprates , but also indicate coherent electron motion along the direction perpendicular to the cuo - plane .",
    "a bilayer hamiltonian corresponding to ybco was first written down in a paper in which an interlayer tunneling theory of superconductivity was proposed  @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian was subsequently derived from a downfolding process in a band structure calculation  @xcite .",
    "as long as the fermionic quasiparticles exist as excitations of the normal ground state , it is impossible to deny the existence of bilayer splitting , which results from the superposition of the electronic states of the layers within a bilayer block . for each value of momentum , there is a bonding and an antibonding state that are split in energy . in the original context",
    "@xcite it was argued that only in a superconducting state such a coherent linear superposition is possible .",
    "however , it is clear that the only requirement is the existence of a finite quasiparticle residue .",
    "an important effect discussed earlier  @xcite is that the phase of the ddw order parameter of the two layers within a bilayer block make a large difference . even though the bilayer splitting can be substantial , the splitting of the fermi surface areas for the out - of - phase case can be very small as compared to the in - phase case .",
    "we shall focus on these two alternatives amongst other considerations .    for many years",
    "it has been argued that the normal state of high temperature superconductors is incoherent , especially in the underdoped regime .",
    "here we shall focus on very low temperatures , where a sharp statement can be made .",
    "the view that the normal state is a non - fermi liquid appears to be at variance with the striking qo experiments mentioned above .",
    "we look for consistency with recent experiments  @xcite involving multiple frequencies , emphasizing of course the general aspects of a mean field theory . a further motivation is a measurement in a tilted magnetic field  @xcite , where inconsistency of a scenario in which observed multiple frequencies arise from bilayer - split pockets is pointed out .",
    "the idea of probing qo with a tilted field is important , but our theoretical analyses are not in agreement with those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we emphasize a commensurate density wave order as the cause of fermi surface reconstruction as revealed in quantum oscillation measurements , although some evidence for incommensuration does exist  @xcite .",
    "the pressing questions can hopefully be addressed in a simpler setting : why should the fermi liquid picture be valid for the normal state ? is the motion along the direction perpendicular to the cuo - planes ( @xmath3-axis ) coherent ? why do other experimental probes of the electronic structure paint a very different picture of the fermiology ?",
    "in reality , no direct evidence for any kind of long range density wave order exists in the regime of interest to the qo measurements . fluctuating order does not solve this dilemma , especially because the qo measurements require very large correlation lengths and nearly static order .",
    "the simplest possible explanation of the main aspects of the measurements call for long range order",
    ". moreover , there are strong arguments from detailed fits to the measurements that the relatively high magnetic field is not the root of these observations  @xcite , beyond the obvious effect of suppressing superconductivity .",
    "indeed , previous nmr measurements in @xmath9 up to at least @xmath15 have shown no signatures of field induced order . yet the qo measurements for this stoichiometric material are clear and unambiguous . of course , nmr measurements  @xcite in higher fields of the order of @xmath16 t would be interesting . given these larger issues and many others , it is not particularly attractive to focus on details such as incommensurate versus commensurate order . in any case , it was shown previously  @xcite that within mean field theory it is quite simple to incorporate incommensurate order with very little change of the big picture ; to go beyond mean field theory is quite difficult and is not particularly fruitful without a sufficiently strong motivation .",
    "an important point with regard to ddw is that it is hidden from most common probes and its existence perhaps could have gone unnoticed .",
    "the present manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we set up the effective hamiltonian and discuss bilayer splitting in section 3 . in section 4 we discuss our results in a perpendicular magnetic field and in section 5 those in a tilted field . in section 6 we discuss how variation of parameters provide contrasting evidence of the out - of - phase versus in - phase ddw order . in sec .",
    "7 we discuss in detail the temperature dependences and the oscillation magnitudes of both the magnetization and the specific heat within the lifshitz - kosevich - luttinger formula but with dingle factors reflecting vortex scattering rate in the mixed state . section 8 contains remarks regarding unresolved puzzles .",
    "we consider a tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath17 , which captures correctly the bilayer splitting and the matrix elements between the unit cells ; see figure  [ fig : unitcell ] : @xmath18    [ fig : unitcell ]    .",
    "each unit cell contains a bilayer cuo block .",
    "note that tunneling matrix elements within a bilayer unit and between the nearest neighbour planes between the unit cells are kept ; other matrix elements are exponentially smaller.,width=8 ]    the fermion annihilation operator @xmath19 depends on the bilayer index @xmath20 within the unit cell and the index @xmath21 refers to the unit cell .",
    "the spin indices are suppressed and @xmath22 is a two - dimensional vector .",
    "only the hopping matrix element , @xmath23 , between the nearest neighbor planes of two adjacent unit cells are kept , as the tunnelling matrix elements to further neighbour planes are considerably smaller . for simplicity @xmath23",
    "is assumed to be momentum independent , as very little is known about its precise form .",
    "this assumption will have little effect on our analysis .",
    "the bilyaer matrix element corresponding to @xmath0 is  @xcite @xmath24^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the in - plane lattice constant , ignoring slight orthorhombicity .",
    "@xmath17 can be further simplified by the canonical transformation  @xcite , @xmath26 } e^{\\mp i\\phi(k_{z})/2},\\ ] ] which diagonalizes it in the momentum space .",
    "note the additional phase factors , @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the choice of the phase @xmath31 preserves the fermion anticommutaion rules and results in an energy spectrum that is periodic in @xmath32 , which preserves the periodicity of the conventional unit cell .",
    "the @xmath33 bilayer block is still not diagonal and must be diagonalized further to obtain the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "note that @xmath23 is a matrix element between the nearest neighbour planes of the two bilayer blocks and will be chosen to be an adjustable parameter .",
    "the canonical transformation leads to @xmath34c^{\\dagger}_{1}(k_{z},{\\bf k})c_{2}(k_{z},{\\bf k})+h.c.\\right\\ } \\label{eq : eq4}\\ ] ] we use a common band structure  @xcite , @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , but @xmath38 is chosen to be @xmath39 .",
    "this renormalized value of @xmath38 , as compared to the band structure value of @xmath40 , seems to be phenomenologically more appropriate in the underdoped regime of interest to us .",
    "however , the specific results pertaining to the ground state at @xmath41 are independent of the magnitude of @xmath38 ; even if we had chosen @xmath42 , the results would have been the same provided the remaining parameters are chosen proportionately .",
    "this is no longer be true when we consider the @xmath43 properties discussed in sec .",
    ". we shall first choose @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; these parameters are expected to be highly renormalized in the underdoped regime . even when bilayer splitting is clearly observed in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in heavily overdoped @xmath46 ( bi2212 )  @xcite ,",
    "the actual magnitude of @xmath47 is severely overestimated by the band structure calculations , @xmath48 mev , as opposed to the observed @xmath49 mev . in the underdoped regime ,",
    "the band structure value is likely to be more unreliable because of strong correlation effects . in sec .",
    "6 we shall see how the variation of @xmath47 affects the principal conclusions .",
    "the @xmath33 hamiltonian has the eigenvalues @xmath50 it is interesting to note that with our choice of the phase of the fermion operators the distance between the layers in a bilayer block , @xmath51 , does not appear explicitly in the spectrum , only implicitly in the magnitude of the hopping matrix elements .",
    "the above result is very different from the conventional warping of layered materials that contain only one electronically active plane per unit cell , which leads to a dispersion @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that the two bilayer split bands are warped differently as a function of @xmath53 , as seen in figure  [ fig : warp ] .",

    ", width=8 ]    as long as @xmath23 is nonzero , the splitting at the nodal locations @xmath56 is non - zero .",
    "we now fold the brillouin zone to the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) bounded by @xmath57 , corresponding to the two - fold commensurate singlet ddw order parameter and augment @xmath17 by @xmath58 : @xmath59+(1\\to 2),\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and the ddw gap @xmath61 is real and is given by @xmath62 note that the ddw order parameters are chosen to be in - phase for the layers . to reproduce the experimental frequencies we require a somewhat large value of @xmath63 within our mean field approximation ; in sec .",
    "6 we shall consider a small variation of this parameter .    the singlet ddw condensate is defined by  @xcite @xmath64 note that it involves @xmath65 for spin indices .",
    "this is the reason why the spin indices can be conveniently suppressed .",
    "this is a particle - hole condensate that breaks the following symmetries : translation by a lattice spacing , time reversal , parity , and a rotation by @xmath66 , while the product of any two are preserved .",
    "the order parameter corresponds to angular momentum @xmath67 .",
    "since there is no exchange symmetry between a particle and a hole , the orbital wave function does not determine the spin wave function .",
    "therefore , there is also a corresponding triplet ddw , which consists of a staggered pattern of circulating spin currents  @xcite , as opposed to a staggered pattern circulating charge currents . in the present work",
    ", we shall consider only the singlet ddw order and make only brief remarks regarding the triplet ddw at the very end .",
    "the staggering is determined by the wave vector @xmath68 .",
    "the combined hamiltonian @xmath69 can be written in terms of the four component spinor @xmath70 , suppressing once again the spin indices , which is irrelevant for a singlet ddw order parameter . in terms of this spinor",
    "the combined hamiltonian is @xmath71 where @xmath72 note that the ddw order parameters in the two @xmath33 diagonal blocks are in phase .",

    "we stress that the phenomenological nature of our work precludes us from fitting parameters with certainty , nor is it our intention .",
    "we only look for some qualitative insights .",
    "however , since in this section we shall be computing the oscillatory part of the thermodynamic potential , as a function of temperature and magnetic field , not just the frequencies , a good estimate of the leading tight - binding matrix element @xmath38 is necessary for materials relevant for quantum oscillation experiments .",

    "we expect that the total scattering rate to be given by the combination of defect and vortex scattering rates @xmath179 moreover , these scattering rates must depend on the particular extremal area , @xmath180 , under consideration .",
    "the calculation of the dingle factors @xmath181 especially in the mixed phase including disorder , with coexisting fluctuating @xmath51-wave superconducting order parameter and ddw , is a daunting task .",
    "previously , we have shown rigorously that almost any form of conventional disorder due to defects in a pure ddw state suppresses the electron pockets more than the hole pockets .",
    "for the vortex scattering rate , however , an approximate treatment based on a paper by stephen  @xcite led to an interesting prediction relating the dingle factors of electron and hole pockets ( not including bilayer splitting ) in the commensurate case , which is @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a characteristic scale having the dimension of mass corresponding to the _ massless _ nodal fermions of the ddw ( ! ) , and @xmath184 is the cyclotron mass corresponding to the electron pocket as defined above ( note that the notations are different here from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which in turn is very close to the band mass defined by expanding around the bottom of the electron pocket .",
    "although the precise numerical relation is difficult to control , it is reasonable to set @xmath185 , with @xmath186 for phenomenological purposes ; we had estimated this parameter earlier to be 4.4  @xcite .      with the frequencies given in table  [ table3 ] , the cyclotron masses in table  [ table4 ] , and the second derivatives of the areas in table  [ table5 ] , we can compute the oscillatory parts of the specific heat and the magnetization",
    "provided we can make reasonable estimates of the dingle factors .",
    "the dingle factor for electrons is a bit more controlled because the band mass obtained obtained by expanding around the antinodal points is quite consistent with the computed cyclotron masses .",
    "assuming that samples have negligible disorder , we shall estimate the scattering rate of the electrons to be given by the vortex scattering rate , which , following an analysis of stephen  @xcite , was found to be  @xcite @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the magnitude of the @xmath41 superconducting gap , which we set to be @xmath189 for the relevant doping range .",

    "we believe that this gives the correct order of magnitude ; for the earlier set of parameters we estimated it to be @xmath194  @xcite .",
    "the dingle factors of the holes are more complex  @xcite because it has to be estimated taking into account the nodal fermions for ddw , but it is not unreasonable to assume @xmath195 in the relation @xmath185 , uniformly for all electron and hole pockets .    the computed specific heat at four representative temperatures are shown in fig .  [ fig : cv1 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a @xmath196-phase shift from high to low temperatures .     as the the temperature is lowered .",
    "the vertical scale is in arbitrary units . ]",
    "the same results are visualized in a 3d - plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv2 ] .        as a function of temperature and magnetic field",
    "the oscillations go through a node , which is also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv1 ] .",
    "the reason for this is the factor @xmath197 in the formula for the specific heat .",
    "the fourier transform of the oscillations in @xmath198 on the other hand shows a more complex structure for specific heat as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv3 ] , which , however , is very sensitive to the dingle factor , the range of @xmath198 over which the fourier transform is performed , and the windowing technique .",
    "the results shown here uses no windowing technique , and the range of the magnetic field is @xmath199 .    , in arbitrary units of the oscillations of the specific heat as a function of the frequency @xmath95 in units of tesla .",

    "[ fig : cv3 ] can be understood by glancing at fig .",
    "[ fig : cv2 ] .",
    "because of the aforementioned node , the transition from @xmath200 to @xmath201 lowers the amplitude . at @xmath202",
    "the amplitude recovers again and then finally decreases again at @xmath203 .",
    "note that only one dominant frequency is seen .",
    "similarly , we also plot the oscillations of the magnetization as a function of @xmath198 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 ] ,        but it is difficult to detect multiple frequencies with naked eyes . even in the fourier transform over a range @xmath199 , shown in fig  [ fig : m1 ] , the multiple electron pocket frequencies known to be present in the formula are not resolved .    , in arbitrary units of the oscillations of the magnetization as a function of the frequency @xmath95 in units of tesla with no windowing and the field range of @xmath199 . ]",
    "the fourier transform is now monotonic as a function of temperature unlike the results for the specific heat .",
    "the arrow indicates weak , unresolved hole pocket frequencies around @xmath204 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : freqs2 ] .",
    "the two electron pocket frequencies at @xmath205 and @xmath206 strongly overlap and lead to a large amplitude .",
    "the spin interference factor @xmath207 play an important role in the respective weights of the various frequencies .",
    "we have argued that bilayer splitting and warping of the electronic dispersion in @xmath53 are necessary consequences of a reconstructed fermi liquid normal state , and measurements in a tilted magnetic field can be useful in probing the frequency spectra of quantum oscillations .",
    "the small value of the warping is intimately connected to the large ratio of the in - plane to @xmath3-axis resistivities . however , the magnitude of bilayer splitting necessary to produce overall consistency with experiments for the in - phase ddw order is strongly renormalized ( @xmath208 mev ) from the band structure value ( @xmath209 mev ) .",
    "note that the distance between the layers is only 3.25 , similar to the in - plane lattice constant .",
    "in contrast , with the out - of - phase ddw order a larger value of bilayer splitting ( @xmath210 mev ) can be tolerated .",
    "this is an important consequence of the out - of - phase ddw order .",
    "although strong electronic correlations in the underdoped regime must be responsible for such renomalized parameters , a convincing explanation is missing despite many speculations , especially because the effective mass is only about twice the free electron mass .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out these qo measurements for larger hole - doping for which we generally expect the splitting to increase , unless some other effects involving the decrease of the magnitude of the order parameter intervenes .",
    "it is worth emphasizing once again that even in heavily overdoped bi2212 , the renormalization of the observed bilayer splitting , 88 mev , in arpes , as compared to the band structure value of 300 mev , is still not understood .",
    "the calculations presented here can be easily extended within a mean field theory to sdw and incommensurate order along the lines discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a more illuminating exercise is to compare and contrast quantum oscillations in hole and electron doped cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the likely differences in the upper critical fields lead to important physical differences",
    ". further work along this direction is in progress .",
    "the triplet ddw  @xcite at the simplest mean field level produces results similar to sdw , which is also a triplet order parameter , but with orbital angular momentum zero .",
    "such triplet order parameters are necessary to explain the experiments  @xcite involving the non - existence of spin zeros in qo .",
    "however , more recent experiments  @xcite have revealed spin zeros and have concluded that quasiparticles behave like charge-@xmath11 , spin-@xmath12 fermions with a @xmath13-factor consistent with 2.2 .",
    "this is strongly indicative of a singlet order parameter , but not a triplet order in the particle - hole channel , such as sdw or triplet ddw  @xcite .",
    "although we have obtained consistency with experiments using fermi liquid theory , it is not certain that non - fermi liquid aspects should be ignored , at least insofar as underdoped ybco is concerned .",
    "convincing explanation of the lack of the hole pocket frequencies required by the luttinger sum rule  @xcite and the inconsistency with fermi arcs observed in arpes , albeit in zero magnetic field , are intriguing .",
    "we know of one example , the @xmath211 quantum hall effect , which despite being a non - fermi liquid has a phenomenology similar to a fermi liquid in many respects  @xcite .",
    "the situation in ncco is clearer  @xcite , however .",
