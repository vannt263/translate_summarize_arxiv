    "a particle with spin @xmath1 is characterized by @xmath2 electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the nucleon has two ffs , called electric ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic ( @xmath4 ) , which , a priori , are different .",
    "proton and neutron ffs are also different .",
    "electromagnetic probes are traditionally preferred to the hadronic beams , and elastic electron hadron scattering contains all information on the nucleon ground state .",
    "the reaction mechanism is assumed to be one photon exchange , the electromagnetic interaction is exactly calculable in qed , and one can safely extract the information on the hadronic vertex . however , one has to introduce radiative corrections , which become very large as the momentum transfer squared , @xmath5 , increases .",
    "radiative corrections were firstly calculated by schwinger @xcite and are important for the discussion of the experimental determination of the differential cross section .",
    "they are also calculable in qed .",
    "the four momentum transfer squared transmitted to the virtual photon , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energies of the incident and scattered electron , and @xmath9 is the electron scattering angle in lab system ) , is negative in elastic @xmath10 scattering , i.e. , the space component is larger than the time component .",
    "the accessible kinematical region is called space - like ( sl ) region . annihilation reactions , such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 ,",
    "allow to scan the time - like ( tl ) region , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the relevant variable in tl region is the square of the total energy , @xmath16 .",
    "form factors are analytical functions of @xmath17 , being real functions in the sl region ( due to the hermiticity of the electromagnetic hamiltonian ) and complex functions in the tl region .",
    "the phrgmen - lindelf theorem @xcite gives a rigorous prescription for the asymptotic behavior of analytical functions : @xmath18 .",
    "this means that , asymptotically , ffs , have the following constraints : 1 ) the time - like phase vanishes and 2 ) the real part of ffs , @xmath19 , coincides with the corresponding value , @xmath20 .    these asymptotic properties based on analiticity , however , are different from the asymptotics properties of ffs , predicted in qcd , which derive from scaling rules and helicity conservation",
    ". therefore , the study of ffs at large @xmath5 represents a unique tool for the understanding of these properties of the nucleon dynamics .",
    "the importance of ffs was recognized since the first measurements of r. hofstadter @xcite , nobel laureate in 1961 , to whom g. liljestrand , member of the royal academy of sciences , addressed with these words : _ `` the myth of the indivisibility of the atom , implied in its very name , was shattered in the beginning of this century , and a completely new and fascinating world of the utmost importance became revealed .",
    "you have been able to obtain further significant information of the intimate structure of this intriguing world by disclosing the distribution of electric charges and magnetic forces within the atomic nucleus , and the particles of which it is composed . '' _    an elegant formalism , in qed , allows to relate measured quantities , as cross section and polarization observables to ffs .",
    "the expressions which relate the moduli of ffs to the unpolarized differential cross section were developed by rosenbluth @xcite for the scattering channel , @xmath21 , and , for the annihilation channel , by zichichi , berman , cabibbo and gatto @xcite .",
    "the importance of polarization phenomena , and the related formalism , were firstly suggested by the kharkov school of akhiezer and rekalo @xcite , and , in tl region , by bilenkyi , giunti and wataghin @xcite and dubnickova , rekalo and dubnicka @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the observables with the theoretical models of hadron structure is straightforward , as , in framework of the mechanism of one - photon approximation , ffs enter directly in the expression of the hadronic electromagnetic current . the matrix element of the process @xmath21 is written as : @xmath22 u(p_1 ) , \\label{eq : mat}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 are the four - momenta of the initial and final electron ( nucleon ) , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dirac and pauli nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the same ffs enter also in the description of elastic scattering of positrons by nucleons . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : csst ] ) it appears that the cross section depends linearly on @xmath33 , and measurements at fixed @xmath5 , at different angles , allow a straightforward extraction of the electric and magnetic ffs .",
    "however , as @xmath5 increases , the electric contribution becomes small , compared to the magnetic part , which is weighted by the factor @xmath38 .",
    "its precise determination becomes , therefore , more difficult .",
    "taking a longitudinally polarized electron beam , and measuring the polarization of the outgoing proton , in @xmath39 ( or , alternatively , using a polarized target , with longitudinally polarized beam ) , the polarization induces an interference term , in the cross section , related to the product of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "it has been shown that the transverse ( @xmath40 ) and the longitudinal ( @xmath41 ) polarization of the proton in the reaction plane ( the third component , normal to the scattering plane vanishes , due to t - invariance ) are proportional to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , so that the simultaneous measurements of these two polarization components gives directly the ratio of the form factors : @xmath44 the experimental realization of this method requires a polarized beam with high intensity , as the proton polarization has to be measured through a secondary scattering on a carbon or polyethylene target .",
    "this is the reason for which it has become possible only in the recent years .",
    "in sl region , the measurements based on the rosenbluth method show that the behavior of the magnetic proton and neutron ffs as a function of @xmath5 , follows approximately a dipole law : @xmath45^{-2},~m_d^2=0.71~\\mbox{gev}^2 , \\label{eq : dipole}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the nucleon magnetic moment in units of the bohr magneton , respectively @xmath47 for proton and @xmath48 for neutron .",
    "such behavior is consistent with the scaling laws predicted by qcd @xcite , but also with a non relativistic picture of an exponential distribution of the magnetization inside the nucleon .    concerning the electric proton ff , when comparing the data derived from the rosenbluth separation and from the polarization transfer method , it turns out that a discrepancy appears between the @xmath5-dependences of the ffs ratio @xmath49 .    from the rosenbluth separation data one finds the scaling relation : @xmath50 @xmath51 , whereas the following parametrization describes the polarization data @xcite : @xmath52 - 0.04 ) \\label{eq : brash}\\ ] ] which implies that the ratio monotonically decreases and deviates from unity , as @xmath5 increasing , reaching a value of @xmath53 0.3 at @xmath54 gev@xmath55 .",
    "a careful experimental and theoretical analysis of this problem is necessary .",
    "the important point is the calculation of radiative corrections to the differential cross section and to polarization observables in elastic @xmath34-scattering . if these corrections are large ( in absolute value ) for the differential cross section @xcite , in particular for high resolution experiments , a simplified estimation of radiative corrections to polarization phenomena @xcite shows that radiative corrections are small for the ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the possibility of a contribution of two photon exchange , suggested long ago @xcite , is actually investigated , and gives rise to experimental @xcite and theoretical efforts @xcite .",

    "few data exist , especially at large @xmath63 , in the tl region , for proton and even less for neutron .",
