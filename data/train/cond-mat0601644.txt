    "josephson - junction charge qubits are known to be candidates for scalable solid - state quantum computing circuits @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . here",
    "we consider a superconducting charge qubit which consists of two josephson junctions embedded in a loop with very small inductance  @xmath0 , typically in the ph range .",
    "this insures effective decoupling from the environment .",
    "however , in the practical implementation of qubit circuitry it is important to have the loop inductance as much as possible consistent with a proper operation of a qubit .",
    "a relative large loop inductance facilitates a qubit control biasing schemes and the formation , control and readout of two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "these considerations stimulated some investigations of the role the loop inductance plays in the dynamic properties of charge qubits @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where for the small loop inductance the corrections to the energy levels due to finite inductance of the loop have been found .",
    "the corrections have been obtained by perturbation expansion of the energy over small parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the josephson junction inductance .    for complex josephson circuit",
    "the construction of quantum hamiltonian which accounts for finite inductances of superconducting loops can be made with the aid of the graph theory @xcite .",
    "this approach has been developed in @xcite for systematic derivation of the hamiltonian of superconducting circuits and has been applied for the calculations of the effects of the finite loop inductance both for flux @xcite and charge @xcite qubits .    in principle , the account for a finite loop inductance ( even if it is small ) requires for the magnetic energy to be included in quantum mechanical hamiltonian of a qubit from the very beginning .",
    "it allows one to obtain the effects of the interaction between two - level qubit and its own lc circuit .",
    "in addition it allows a correct definition of the current operator in terms of its matrix elements in a two level basis .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of finite loop inductance and gate capacitance for a asymmetric charge qubit , which consists of two josephson junctions embedded in a superconducting loop .",
    "the construction of exact lagrangian and hamiltonian for the charge qubit is given in section ii and section iii , respectively .",
    "the approximation for exact hamiltonian for small @xmath0 is made in section iv .",
    "it is shown that hamiltonian is decomposed in three parts : qubit part , lc - oscillator part and the qubit - lc oscillator interaction part . in this approximation",
    "the energy levels of the charge qubit are explicitly dependent on the gate capacitance and critical current asymmetry and , in addition , are shifted due to vacuum fluctuations of lc oscillator .",
    "the current operator both in charge and in eigenstate basis is obtained in section v. it is shown that the asymmetry of critical currents of the josephson junctions results in additional terms in the operator of critical current .",
    "the corrections to the qubit energies due to its interaction with lc circuit and their dependence on critical current asymmetry and on gate capacitance are calculated in section vi .",
    "we consider here a charge qubit in the arrangement , which has been first proposed in @xcite ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the qubit consists of two josephson junctions in a loop with very small inductance  @xmath0 , typically in the ph range .",
    "this insures effective decoupling from the environment . as a general case",
    "we assume that two junctions have different critical currents @xmath3 , @xmath4 and capacitance  @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the josephson energy @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the flux quantum , is assumed to be much less than the coulomb energy @xmath9 , so that the charge at the gate is well defined .",
    "the lagrangian of this qubit is the difference between the charge energy in the junction capacitors and the josephson plus magnetic energy : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electric energy of jj s and gate capacities @xmath12 @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the voltage drop across the inductance .    in virtue of josephson relations",

    "now we construct hamiltonian : @xmath35 eliminating time derivatives of the phases from ( [ ham1 ] ) with the aid of ( [ deltadot ] ) , ( [ phidot ] ) , we obtain the final expression for hamiltonian of the asymmetric charge qubit : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "the point of minimum @xmath49 of @xmath53 ( [ pot ] ) with respect to @xmath48 is defined from @xmath54 : @xmath55 in what follows we consider @xmath56 as slow variable and expand @xmath57 near the point of minimum to the third order in @xmath48 ( @xmath58 ) . in the vicinity of @xmath49",
    "the potential @xmath57 can be written as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the operator conjugate to @xmath61 .    with the aid of ( [ phic ] )",

    "the first term in ( [ hint ] ) describes the interaction of the phase variables of the qubit , @xmath48 and @xmath56 via the gate , the other terms are responsible for the interaction of the qubit with its own lc circuit .",

    "from the first principles the average current in the loop is equal to the first derivative of the eigenenergy relative to the external flux : @xmath108 this expression can be rewritten in terms of exact hamiltonian of a system : @xmath109 from ( [ currb ] ) we would make ansatz that the current operator is as follows : @xmath110 however ( [ currc ] ) is not a consequence of ( [ currb ] ) .",

    "the prove for our case is given below .",
    "the current operator across every junction is a sum of a supercurrent and a current through the capacitor : @xmath112 we are interested in the current through the inductance coil , @xmath113 in ( [ curr1 ] ) ( see fig.[fig1 ] )",

    "therefore , the equation ( [ currc ] ) gives us the true expression for the current operator .",
    "it is important to note that the proper expression for the current operator ( [ currop1 ] ) can not be obtained without magnetic energy term in the original lagrangian ( [ lag1 ] ) .",
