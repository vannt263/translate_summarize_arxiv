    "dynamo action is an instability by which mechanical energy is transformed into magnetic energy for @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the magnetic reynolds number . since larmor s prediction concerning the solar dynamo@xcite ,",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to this field , including both theories and numerical simulations . in the last decade , the interest for dynamo has been renewed by the positive results obtained by the riga @xcite and karlsruhe @xcite fluid dynamo experiments .",
    "these experiments rely on analytical predictions by ponomarenko @xcite and robert @xcite and have been designed accordingly .",
    "in particular , the generated turbulent sodium flows are organized so that the instantaneous flow remains always close to the mean flow , allowing the kinematic dynamo predictions of the thresholds and of the neutral modes ( respectively oscillatory and stationary ) to be very accurate .",
    "a new step was passed very recently in the von krmn sodium ( vks ) experiment .",
    "different dynamos have been observed inside a flow of liquid sodium at large reynolds number ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "depending on the the control paramaters , statistically stationary dynamos or dynamical dynamo regimes including field reversals have been reported . under these conditions ,",
    "the flow is fully turbulent , with many large and small scale fluctuations , and the instantaneous flow is very different from the mean flow @xcite .",
    "the dynamo instability taking place in the vks experiment is thus at variance with the classical instabilities taking place in laminar flows or in turbulent flows remaining very close to their mean .",
    "nevertheless , many kinematic dynamo simulations have been performed to optimize this flow , using the synthetic mnd flow @xcite or time - averaged flows measured in water - prototype experiments @xcite .",
    "different observations have been made that can help elucidate the exact mechanism by which the dynamo instability develops in the vks experiment : i ) in the exactly counter - rotating case , dynamo action is observed above a critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath3 and the dominant saturated mode is an axisymmetric m=0 mode in cylindrical coordinates @xcite ; ii ) so far , dynamo has only been observed with iron propellers @xcite ; iii ) in a given experimental set up with iron disks , dynamo has been observed when counter - rotating disks in ( + ) non scooping direction ( with respect to the propellers blades ) , but no dynamo has been observed when counter - rotating the disks in the ( - ) scooping direction @xcite .",
    "observation i ) shows that the dynamo mechanism is not the simple linear response to the mean flow alone , since the latter is axisymmetric and produces a transverse @xmath4 mode ( @xmath5 denotes the azimuthal wavenumber ) above @xmath6 as indicated by kinematic dynamo simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that the m=0 mode of the vks experiment is in fact generated by non - axisymmetric fluctuations through an alpha - omega mechanism taking place within the blades of the propellers .",
    "this suggestion has been confirmed by recent numerical simulations @xcite showing that the addition of an ( empirical and large ) alpha term in the induction equation changes the dominant m=1 mode into a dominant m=0 mode with a dynamo threshold close to the observed experimental critical value @xmath3 .",
    "another interesting suggestion has been made by @xcite , namely that the m=0 mode could arise from a secondary bifurcation of the m=1 mode , since the latter breaks the original axisymmetry of the velocity field .",
    "observation ii ) shows that magnetic boundary conditions have a large impact on the dynamo instability .",
    "high magnetic permeability conditions are known to decrease the dynamo threshold for the roberts and ponomarenko flows @xcite and more recently for von krmn type flows @xcite . for iron disk",
    ", it is suggested that the dynamo threshold could be reduced by a factor as large as 2 with respect to stainless disks . since it has not been yet possible to get beyond @xmath7 in the vks experiment",
    ", this could explain why dynamo has not been observed with stainless steel disks , while it is observed around @xmath8 with iron disks .",
    "other kinematic simulations @xcite have shown that the sodium flow behind the disks can lead to an increase from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "using iron disks can thus also screen magnetic effects of the flow behind the disks .",

    "observation iii ) shows that the dynamo is not produced only by the rotation of magnetized iron disks in a conducting fluid but depends on the flow characteristics : it is a real fluid dynamo .",
    "however , not much has been done so far to try and exploit this observation . in particular , no kinematic dynamo simulations have been performed so far with experimental flows including an annulus as in the vks experiment or with propellers counter - rotating in the ( - ) scooping direction .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry ( spiv ) measurements obtained in von krmn water ( vke ) experiments modeling the vks experiment to perform kinematic dynamo simulations .",
    "we investigate the role of the mean field structure on the dynamo threshold , with special attention to the rotation sense . because of the axisymmetry , the exhibited kinematic mode is , as expected , different from the experimental saturated one . however , we show that the kinematic dynamo thresholds qualitatively vary like the observed dynamo thresholds and discuss how these results can be useful to understand the actual mechanisms at the origin of vks dynamo .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , after the problem formulation , we describe the experimental measurements and the numerical method . in sec .",
    "iii , we focus on the processing procedure of the measured velocities and perform a comparison with previous estimates based on laser doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) measurements . results for dynamo action are presented in sec .",
    "iv and compared with the vks experiments .",
    "finally , we discuss the consequences of these results for the vks dynamo .",
    "in the present paper , we focus on the kinematic dynamo problem : we consider a given velocity field @xmath11 , e.g. as measured in a water experiment , and check its ability to sustain dynamo action by solving the magnetic induction equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the magnetic field with , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the magnetic permeability and the electrical conductivity of the considered medium , and @xmath16 is the laplacian operator . since @xmath11 is given , the equation is linear in @xmath13 .",
    "there are two possible long - time behaviour for the magnetic field : either it is decaying and there is no dynamo , or it is increasing , and there is dynamo . growth or decay is in general exponential ( although there can be transient algebraic growth , due to non - normality of the operator , see @xcite ) . to quantify the growth",
    ", we introduce the growth rate that is based on the magnetic energy , where the average is taken over the spatial domain .    since the equation is linear , no saturation",
    "is observed in the kinematic approach .",
    "this technique is therefore unable to detect subcritical or finite amplitude dynamos @xcite or to study the saturation regime @xcite as in numerical flows such as the taylor - green flow.citer simulations forest ? ? .",
    "however , this approach gives an estimation for the dynamo threshold as a function of the mean velocity field .",
    "_ geometry and experimental setup. _ the setup corresponding to the vks experiment is described in details in @xcite and sketched in figure [ fig1](a ) . a cylindrical vessel with a fixed aspect ratio of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( resp .",

    "we arrange the coordinate system such , that the axial extension of the cylinder is situated in the interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the fluid is stirred by two independent rotating so called tm73 impellors @xcite , at frequencies @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the impellers are fitted with curved blades ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "therefore , the flow properties depend on the sense of rotation , specifically on whether the blades are presenting their concave ( ( - ) rotation ) or convex ( ( + ) rotation ) side to the flow during impeller rotation . in the special case",
    "where @xmath23 ( resp .",

    "( - ) ) counter - rotation",
    ". an optional concentric annulus can also be inserted at mid height and has been used in the first dynamo runs .",
    "this annulus reduces large scale fluctuations @xcite and can also have an impact on the mean flow , in particular on the toroidal to poloidal ratio @xmath25 ( see below ) . in the vks experiment ,",
    "an additional layer of resting sodium is present in the outer part of the experiment .",
    "the vke experiment is the exact half - scale water model of the vks experiment , except that the experiment is realized vertically ( vertical z axis ) whereas the vks setup is horizontal .",
    "the cylinder radius and height of the vke vessel are @xmath26 and @xmath27 mm respectively",
    ". we have used tm73 impellers of diameter @xmath28 mm fitted with radial blades of height @xmath29 mm and curvature radius @xmath30 mm .",
    "the inner faces of the disks are @xmath31 mm apart .",
    "we have worked with different vessel geometries , allowing the insertion of an annulus - thickness @xmath32 mm , inner diameter @xmath33 mm - in the equatorial plane .",
    "note also that in the vke experiment , the layer of resting fluid is absent .",
    "the velocity field is therefore only measured in the _ flow region _ , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "velocity measurements are performed using a dantec spiv system , providing the three components of the velocity field on a plane through a @xmath34 points grid @xcite . in all that follows ,",
    "the measurement plane is a meridian plane containing the rotation axis .",
    "the velocity fields are averaged over time series of @xmath35 regularly sampled values ( sampling frequency between 1 and 15 hz ) . in the exact counter - rotating regime ,",
    "the system is axisymmetric and symmetric with respect to any rotation @xmath36 of @xmath37 around any radial axis in its equatorial plane .",
    "the mean flow is composed of two toroidal cells separated by an azimuthal shear layer and two poloidal recirculation cells .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the velocity fields obtained in the 4 studied configurations : ( + ) and ( - ) rotation sense in the presence or the absence of an annulus in the equatorial plane .",
    "note that in the exact counter - rotating regime , no turbulent bifurcation towards a one cell state is observed with the tm73 impellers contrary to what is reported for impellers with higher curvarture blades in @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation is observed in the ( + ) sense for a rotation number @xmath38 without annulus and @xmath39 with annulus @xcite .    _ control parameters. _ choosing the magnetic field diffusion time @xmath40 as the time scale , and the maximum absolute value of the flow velocity @xmath41 as velocity unit",
    ", the induction equation can be expressed in dimensionless form : @xmath42 where is the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath43 for dynamo onset is then defined such that @xmath44 .",
    "another important parameter to characterize the velocity field is the poloidal to toroidal ratio :    [ gamma ] @xmath45    which is known to have a great impact on the dynamo threshold @xcite .",
    "here we denoted the components of the velocity field in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath46 .      because the system is axisymmetric , the time - averaged velocity field is supposed to be axisymmetric .",
    "we integrate the induction equation using an axially periodic kinematic dynamo code .",
    "we only provide here its brief description , details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the code is pseudospectral in the axial and azimuthal directions while the radial dependence is treated by a high - order finite difference scheme .",
    "the numerical resolution corresponds to a grid of @xmath47 points for one wavelength in axial direction , @xmath48 points in azimuthal direction ( corresponding to azimuthal wave numbers @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 points in radial direction for the flow domain .",
    "the time scheme is second - order adams - bashforth with a typical time step of @xmath51 .",
    "electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability are homogeneous and the external medium is insulating .",
    "implementation of the magnetic boundary conditions for a finite cylinder is difficult , due to the nonlocal character of the continuity conditions at the boundary of the conducting fluid @xcite .",
    "in contrast , axially periodic boundary conditions are easily formulated , since the harmonic external field then has an analytical expression .",
    "indeed , the numerical elementary box consists of two mirror - symmetric experimental velocity fields in order to avoid strong velocity discontinuities along the @xmath52 axis @xcite .",
    "note that we do not take into account the effet of the flow behind the propellers .",
    "this effect has been studied in details in other kinematic simulations @xcite .    finally , we can act on the electromagnetic boundary conditions by adding a layer of stationary conductor of dimensionless thickness @xmath53 , corresponding to sodium at rest surrounding the flow exactly as in the vks experiment in cadarache @xcite .",
    "this extension is made keeping the radial resolution of the experimental measured velocity field constant ( @xmath50 points in the flow region ) .",
    "the velocity field we use as input for the numerical simulations is thus simply fit in an homogeneous conducting cylinder of radius @xmath54 :    [ conductlayer ] @xmath55    former investigations @xcite showed a decrease of the critical magnetic reynolds number for increasing conducting layer size , with a saturation above .",
    "therefore , we fixed ( meaning altogehter @xmath56 points in radial direction ) in order to save computing time .",
    "some calculations with ( @xmath57 points ) have also been done , when comparing with older computations based on ldv measurements .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] gives an example of the total velocity field used in kinematic simulations , consisting of an experimentally measured velocity field @xmath58 and a conducting layer with .",
    "due to experimental measurement constraints , it is impossible to determine the field in the whole cylinder cut : i ) in the propeller regions , the presence of blades prevents the spiv measurements ; ii ) close to the cylinder , reflection effects spoil any velocity measurements ; iii ) when an annulus is inserted at mid - height ( @xmath59 ) , measurements can not be performed in the thin area behind and around the annulus .",
    "therefore a typical data set covers only the area .",
    "this means , that approximately more than a third of the velocity field is unknown and has to be determined by boundary conditions and spline extrapolation .",

    "_ check with ldv measurements. _ ldv measurements are free of certain deficiency of the spiv measurements , especially near the cylinder boundary , where reliable velocity fields can be obtained .",
    "it is therefore interesting to test the validity of our spiv field preparation by comparison with ldv fields obtained previously by ravelet et al .",

    "the variation with @xmath73 of the velocity fields looks very similar except for @xmath60 at mid - radius .",
    "however , the poloidal to toroidal ratio @xmath25 , does not reflect this difference : @xmath74 in both cases . in the ( - ) rotation case , we were not able to perform such a detailed comparison , due to an unexpected experimental problem : the locking of large scale vortices of the middle shear layer at the position of the small cut performed through the annulus to enable spiv measurements ( cf .",

    "this locking does not occur in the ( + ) case , resulting in an axisymmetric time - averaged velocity field .",

    "_ magnetic growing mode. _ in all the studied cases the structure of the kinematic neutral mode is a @xmath4 equatorial dipole mode . in the vks experiment ,",
    "the structure of the saturated has been reported in the ( + ) rotation sense , with annulus , and found to correspond mainly to a @xmath107 mode @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to have detailed measurements of the saturated mode structure in the vks experiment , for the different configurations and in particular in the reverse rotation direction .",
    "one can e.g. wonder whether or not a @xmath4 component is present besides the axial dipole .",
    "as reported above , recent simulations have exhibited an axial dipole ( or quadrupole ) with synthetic flows and particular boundary conditions , and it would be of great interest to study the effect of the annulus and the direction of rotation on these results .",
    "through kinematic simulations using spiv velocity fields measured in a water model experiment , we have shown that the rotation direction of the non axisymmetric impellers in the vks experiment has a great impact on the threshold of the dynamo generated by the mean flow only . by changing the rotation direction",
    ", one can increase the dynamo threshold by a factor 3 in the case with annulus ( 1.4 in the vks experiment ) , and a factor larger than 10 in the case without annulus ( larger than 1.6 in the vks experiment ) .",
    "even if the exact experimental results are not reproduced , the variation of the dynamo threshold with the direction sense is qualitatively reproduced by the kinematic simulations .    since our kinematic simulations do not take into account the magnetic permeability due to iron disks - an effect that can decrease the threshold by a factor 2 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or generate a m=0 mode with an @xmath113 effect @xcite , we do not expect our results to be more than qualitative .",
    "furthermore , our linear simulations do not take into account the back reaction of the lorentz force , that can enforce emergence of the m=0 mode as a secondary bifurcation of the original m=1 mode @xcite .",
    "finally , non axisymmetric turbulent fluctuations can play an important role in the generation of a magnetic dipole @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that the increase ( or the absence ) of the dynamo threshold observed in given configurations of the vks experiment can have two origins : ( i ) the poloidal to toroidal ratio @xmath25 , a parameter previously identified as crucial for dynamo action @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the normalized kinetic energy @xmath117 which quantifies the distance of the instaneous flow to the mean flow .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is certainly important for the alpha - omega mechanism proposed in @xcite , giving the relative importance of the @xmath113 effect generated by the blades vortices ( poloidal recirculation ) vs. the omega effect due to differential rotation ( toroidal flow ) .",
    "detailed experimental study of the propellers vortices dynamics with the rotation direction would represent an important step to validate the numerical predictions .",
