    "the interstellar grains affect starlight which passes through them by absorbing and scattering photons .",
    "these two physical processes produce interstellar extinction which depends on the properties of dust grains , e.g. , size distribution and composition .",
    "the extinction curve shows the extinction as a function of wavelength from the infrared to ultraviolet .",
    "@xcite presented the average extinction curve of our galaxy at various wavelengths .",
    "it shows some evident features : it rises in the infrared , it shows a slight knee in the optical , it is characterized by a bump at 2175@xmath3 , and it rises in the far - ultraviolet .",
    "these features are common between different environments .",
    "the interstellar grain properties are different in diffuse and dense interstellar medium and thus also the extinction changes .",
    "cardelli , clayton and mathis ( 1989 ; hereafter ccm ) found an average extinction law valid over the wavelength range @xmath4 , which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium .",
    "this extinction law depends on only one parameter , @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the visual extinction and @xmath6 is the color excess or reddening .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter ranges from about 2.0 to about 5.5 ( with a typical value of 3.1 ) when one goes from diffuse to dense interstellar medium and thus @xmath1 characterizes the region that produces the extinction .",
    "if one knows the value of @xmath1 along a particular line of sight , one can obtain the extinction curve at any wavelength @xmath7 from the infrared to ultraviolet using ccm law : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the wavelength - dependent coefficients .",
    "there are different ways to obtain @xmath1 using optical / nir or uv extinction data .",
    "@xcite computed @xmath1 values for the sample of 597 ob stars for which the optical / nir magnitudes are known .",
    "he assumed that , in the infrared spectral region , the normalized extinction curve is proportional to @xmath12 or @xmath13 . extrapolating the ir interstellar extinction curve to @xmath14 he derived @xmath1 as : @xmath15 _ { \\lambda \\longrightarrow \\infty}. \\label{rvwegner}\\ ] ]",
    "@xcite applied the @xmath16 minimization method to compute @xmath1 values for a sample of ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction data using the linear relation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) .",
    "@xcite extended the analysis of @xcite by using non - equal weights derived from observational errors to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 values toward the sample of 782 stars with known ultraviolet color excesses .",
    "in this paper we use both near - infrared ( @xmath17 ) and uv photometry to obtain @xmath1 values for a sample of 436 lines of sight .",
    "we arrive at two main conclusions : ( i ) there are lines of sight with extinction in the nir or / and uv which generically do nt follow ccm law , and ( ii ) there are lines of sight which show an extinction curve that can not be reproduced with a single @xmath1 value in the whole wavelength range .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in  [ th.basis ]",
    "we discuss the theoretical basis of the @xmath16 minimization method we use to derive @xmath1 values . in  [ data ] we describe our data sources . in  [ results ] we present the results and show two main peculiar classes of extinction curves present in our sample . finally in  [ conclusion ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "we normalize extinction in a standard way : @xmath18 the absolute extinction may be deduced from the relative extinction by using total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath1 : @xmath19 because : @xmath20 for each individual band , equation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) and ( [ eps ] ) can be combined to derive an @xmath1 value .",
    "more generally , the @xmath16 minimization can be used to obtain the @xmath1 value that provides the best ccm fit to all observed extinction data . here",
    "we follow our previous method @xcite and use a weighted formula to find @xmath1 by minimizing the following @xmath16 : @xmath21 \\ } ^2 ~e^2(b - v ) , \\label{chiweighted}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are the weights associated with each band , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the coefficients of ccm law .    minimizing equation ( [ chiweighted ] ) with respect to @xmath1 , yields : @xmath25 where in the current work @xmath26 values are taken from @xcite and they were computed according to : @xmath27 = \\left [ \\frac{1}{e(b - v ) } \\right]^2 \\ , \\left \\{\\sigma^2[e(b - v ) ] + [ e(\\lambda_i - v)]^2 \\ , \\sigma^2[e(\\lambda_i - v ) ] \\right \\ } \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] we compute the error in @xmath1 as : @xmath28",
    "the data used for the determination of extinction curve shapes have two essential ingredients : 1 ) photometric measurements , 2 ) intrinsic colors for a star with a given spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "since @xcite provided a self - consistent set of intrinsic colors over the entire wavelength range for 436 lines of sight , we use his sample of stars in our analysis . wegner s ( 2002 ) catalog provides both intrinsic colors @xcite and photometric measurements in @xmath29 bands . in our preliminary analysis",
    "@xcite we use wegner s ( 2002 ) colors as our only data source . however , wegner s ( 2002 )",
    "photometric data in the infrared come from several sources and as a result are rather inhomogeneous filters mostly from the catalog of gezari , schmitz , & mead ( 1984 ) and @xcite .",
    "the catalog of gezari et al .",
    "( 1984 ; 1993 ) contains infrared observations published in the scientific literature from 1965 through 1990 .",
    "( 2002 ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 magnitudes with accuracy of @xmath32 mag originate from @xcite and @xcite . the spectral classification and @xmath33 data with accuracy of @xmath32 mag are quoted after simbad database .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the optical / nir bands are : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 . ] .",
    "therefore , here we opt for using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) database @xcite as our only input outside of the uv spectral range .",
    "it is a very homogeneous database covering the entire sky .",
    "complete 2mass photometry with unflagged errors is available for all stars ( except for hd7252 , hd34087 , hd183143 ) in wegner s ( 2002 ) sample . since 2mass catalog includes only @xmath42 bands ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and so measurements span a relatively narrow wavelength range we test for possible systematic problems by comparing @xmath1 values obtained using 2mass data ( @xmath46 ) with the ones computed using wegner s ( 2002 ) optical / nir data ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "only 4% of lines of sight have @xmath48 values strongly deviating from the 1-to-1 relationship and those are listed in table [ table1 ] . in the first column",
    "we give stellar ids ; in the second column we report @xmath47 values computed using wegner s ( 2002 ) data in uv ; the third column shows the error in @xmath47 ; the fourth column lists @xmath46 values obtained using @xmath0 bands from 2mass ; errors in @xmath46 are given in the fifth column .",
    "the sixth column shows the difference in @xmath1 obtained by comparing columns two and four normalized to the combined error .",
    "we remove these 19 suspicious lines of sight and advance 414 stars to further analysis .    in summary , 2mass is our only source of ir photometry and we adopt intrinsic colors used by @xcite , which originate from his previous work @xcite . since the effective wavelengths in ir are different between 2mass and @xcite we discuss whether any corrections are necessary to put them on the same system ( appendix [ appendix ] ) .    the ultraviolet photometry is taken from @xcite and based on _ astronomical netherlands satellite _ ( ans ) ; the effective wavelengths of the @xmath49 bands are : 0.1549 , 0.1799 , 0.2200 , 0.2493 , and 0.3294 @xmath50 .",
    "in this section we present the results of our analysis .",
    "we analyze the goodness of ccm fit for our sample (  [ chitest ] ) and test the universality of ccm law as a function of wavelength (  [ univtest ] ) .",
    "a useful method to test if all extinction data points are well fitted by ccm law is to compute @xmath16 per degree of freedom ( @xmath51 ) based on equation ( [ chiweighted ] ) .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is the number of points minus the number of fitted parameters ( in our case the only parameter is @xmath1 ) .",
    "we note that our @xmath51 have a mean value less than one in both wavelength ranges , indicating that the errors might have been overestimated .",
    "there are two major contributors to errors : 1 ) photometric uncertainties from 2mass in ir and from @xcite in uv , 2 ) intrinsic color uncertainties set by @xcite , and it is not obvious how to scale the errors down .",
    "therefore , we do not renormalize our errors requesting @xmath52 .",
    "however , we believe that it is safer to treat our @xmath51 as a measure of a relative rather than absolute quality of the ccm fit . we remove the lines of sight with extinction curves not well fitted by ccm law .",
    "we define outliers based on the tail of our @xmath51 distributions : @xmath53 for the ir data , and @xmath54 for the uv data ( figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "we find that 60 lines of sight ( 14% of the entire sample ) disagree with ccm law at this level .",
    "they are listed in table [ table2 ] . in the first column",
    "we give stellar ids ; in the second column we report @xmath46 values obtained using @xmath0 bands from 2mass ; the third column shows the error in @xmath46 ; the fourth column lists @xmath51 values for the ccm fit in ir ; in the fifth column we give @xmath55 values computed using wegner s ( 2002 ) data in uv , and in the sixth column the error in @xmath55 .",
    "finally in the seventh column there are @xmath51 values for the ccm fit in uv .",
    "we further analyze the 354 lines of sight with @xmath51 below the limits set in  [ chitest ] for which we expect that ccm law fits well all observed extinction data from nir to uv .",
    "the usual assumption is that the knowledge of the @xmath1 value obtained from the optical / nir part of the extinction curve may be used to obtain the entire extinction curve by using ccm law .",
    "we critically test this assumption using two sets of @xmath1 values for each line of sight : the nir @xmath1 ( @xmath56 ) and ultraviolet @xmath1 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we compute the following statistic :    @xmath58 + \\sigma^2[^{\\rm{uv}}\\!r_{v}^{\\rm{wegner } } ] } } \\label{deviation}\\ ] ]    figure [ figure3 ] shows the histogram of @xmath59 .",
    "the peak of the histogram around a median of @xmath60 indicates that the number of extinction curves with @xmath61 is higher than the one with @xmath62 or equivalently that @xmath1 derived from uv spectral region tends to be smaller on average .",
    "this is an important systematic effect that deserves further study but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we choose to define outliers considering the symmetric distribution around the peak : specifically , we select the outliers as the lines of sight characterized by @xmath63 or @xmath64 . we classify them as peculiar in the sense that ccm law is not able to reproduce the whole extinction curve with a single value of @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows these peculiar extinction curves .",
    "all 45 of them ( 10% of the entire sample ) are listed in table [ table3 ] . in the first column",
    "we give stellar ids ; in the second column we report @xmath46 values obtained using @xmath0 bands from 2mass ; the third column shows the error in @xmath46 ; the fourth column lists @xmath55 values computed using wegner s ( 2002 ) data in uv ; the errors in @xmath55 are given in the fifth column .",
    "the sixth column shows @xmath59 values obtained by comparing columns two and four .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] presents the comparison between the @xmath1 values obtained from nir and uv extinction data .",
    "there is a large scatter around the 1-to-1 relationship ; however , only the 45 points with error bars shown are those which deviate from this relation significantly ( according to our @xmath59 cut ) .",
    "valencic , clayton & gordon ( 2004 ) made a similar comparison for their sample .",
    "they compared the @xmath1 values obtained using 2mass photometry in ir with the @xmath1 values in uv obtained using _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "they found that 93% of their sample shows a good agreement ( within 3@xmath65 ) between the two values , which is consistent with our result .",
    "as opposed to @xcite however , we do nt assume that our outliers must result from faulty data .",
    "we will investigate this issue in the future to see to what extent the peculiar properties come from systematic problem with the data and to what degree they are due to peculiar grain properties .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows two examples of extinction curves spanning wavelength range from nir to uv which are well fitted by the ccm law with a single @xmath1 value .",
    "table [ table4 ] lists @xmath1 and @xmath2 values for all 309 of such lines of sight .",
    "here we present only the first 15 objects .",
    "the complete table is available in the electronic version of the journal and on the world wide web . in the first column we list the stellar i d , and in the second and third columns we give the coordinates .",
    "the fourth column contains @xmath6 values taken from @xcite ; in the fifth and sixth columns we list @xmath1 values ( obtained using all data from infrared to uv ) and their errors ; in the seventh column we provide @xmath51 of the ccm fit ; in the eighth and ninth columns we list @xmath2 values with their errors .",
    "there are a lot of cases for which the @xmath51 is substantially less than one , which means that the errors of the individual points might have been overestimated .",
    "for this reason the @xmath51 listed in table [ table4 ] is probably a better measure of a relative rather than absolute quality of the ccm fit .",
    "we use a @xmath16 minimization method to compute @xmath1 values for a sample of 436 lines of sight .",
    "we compare @xmath48 values obtained using 2mass data with the ones computed using wegner s ( 2002 ) data in optical / ir .",
    "we conclude that 414 lines of sight have @xmath48 that agree using different datasets . for this final sample of 414 lines of sight",
    "we derive our @xmath1 values from ir and uv data assuming ccm law .",
    "we analyze the goodness of ccm fit for all lines of sight using the @xmath51 statistic and test the universality of ccm law by computing @xmath1 values separately for the nir and uv part of the extinction curve .",
    "we construct a catalog of @xmath1 and @xmath2 values for the 309 extinction curves with good fits to the ccm law .",
    "we divided the remaining 24% of cases into two groups , according to two main peculiarities : a ) the nir and uv extinction data points can not be fitted well by the ccm law ( 14% of the entire sample ) , b ) @xmath1 values are significantly different for the two spectral regions , nir and uv ( 10% of the entire sample ) . unless caused by faulty data , these peculiar extinction curves might come from unusual properties of dust grains .",
    "therefore , theoretical modeling of these extinction curves ( e.g. , mishchenko 1989 ; saija et al .",
    "2001 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) may help us to understand the processes that modify the properties of interstellar grains .",

    "2mass catalog is our primary source of ir photometry . however , since we want to use a self - consistent set of intrinsic colors over the entire wavelength range , we take the intrinsic colors from @xcite to obtain the ir color excesses . as reported in ",
    "[ data ] , the effective wavelengths of the near - infrared bands used by @xcite are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and are somewhat different from the 2mass ones : @xmath66 ; @xmath44 ; @xmath67 .",
    "well - defined color excesses come from photometry and intrinsic colors corresponding to the same wavelength .",
    "the first possibility to deal with this mismatch is to convert our adopted intrinsic colors to the 2mass photometric system . to this aim , we use linear interpolation formulae : @xmath68,\\\\ ( h_{2m}-v)_0&=&(h - v)_{0w}+ \\frac{\\lambda_{h2m}-\\lambda_{hw}}{\\lambda_{kw}-\\lambda_{hw } } [ ( k - v)_{0w}-(h - v)_{0w}],\\\\ ( k_{2m}-v)_0&=&(h - v)_{0w}+ \\frac{\\lambda_{k2m}-\\lambda_{hw}}{\\lambda_{kw}-\\lambda_{hw } } [ ( k - v)_{0w}-(h - v)_{0w}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath69 indicate 2mass , @xmath70 mean wegner , and @xmath71 refer to the intrinsic colors . for the specific wavelengths used here we obtain : @xmath72,\\\\ ( h_{2m}-v)_0&=&(h - v)_{0w}+0.018 \\cdot [ ( k - v)_{0w}-(h - v)_{0w}],\\\\ ( k_{2m}-v)_0&=&(k - v)_{0w}+0.073 \\cdot [ ( h - v)_{0w}-(k - v)_{0w}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example ,",
    "if we take the spectral type b1v , the color transformation will take the following form : @xmath73 for all relevant spectral types , we find that the color adjustments are extremely small , between 0.0001 and 0.006 . since the errors of the intrinsic colors are much bigger than the above color shifts , we neglect these corrections and use the intrinsic colors given by @xcite when analyzing 2mass data .",
    "it is possible to use a complementary approach and instead of adjusting intrinsic colors make a photometric transformation of 2mass magnitudes to the johnson s ( 1966 ) system adopted by wegner ( 2002 ) .",
    "there are several color transformations provided by @xcite but it is not obvious which set is the most appropriate .",
    "independent of the transformation used the corrections to the extinction data are small , and it is safer not to apply them since the exact values and signs of those corrections depend on the very fine , unknown details of the photometric system used .",
    "this realization reinforces our decision of using 2mass photometry with intrinsic colors by @xcite without any wavelength - related adjustments .",
