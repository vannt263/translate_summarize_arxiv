    "the egret experiment aboard cgro has identified more than 60 blazar - type agn emtting at high - energy ( @xmath6100  mev ) @xmath0-rays ( hartman et al .",
    "most of them show a time - variable @xmath0-ray flux and a few even strong @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "one such example is pks  1622 - 297 , which was detected by egret during a @xmath0-ray high state in june and july 1995 , and on top of that showed a strong @xmath0-ray flare lasting for a few days ( mattox et al .",
    "1997 ) . after the @xmath0-ray activity of pks  1622 - 297 was recognized by egret a target - of - opportunity ( too ) observation for cgro was scheduled which led to the detection of pks  1622 - 297 also at hard x- to soft @xmath0-rays by the osse experiment ( kurfess et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the comptel experiment ( schnfelder et al . 1993 ) , measuring in the mev band between 0.75 and 30  mev , has detected 9 blazars ( e.g. , collmar et al .",
    "1999 ) . among them is pks  1622 - 297 which was detected during this @xmath0-ray high state period in 1995 .",
    "preliminary mev results have been reported by collmar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we briefly present first results of a detailed analysis of the comptel data of this period , and compare them to results in neighbouring energy bands , in particular to the egret band .",
    "a more detailed presentation of the results of the analysis will be given in zhang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    .",
    "comptel observations of pks 1622 - 297 during its 4-week @xmath0-ray high state in 1995 .",
    "the cgro vps and their time periods are given .",
    "the offset angle refers to the angle between the pointing direction of the instrument and the source position . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the egret ( @xmath6100  mev ; from hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) and comptel 10 - 30  mev light curve of the 4 individual cgro vps show neither for comptel nor for egret strong evidence for time variability ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , on shorter time scales ( @xmath41  day ) mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reports strong time variability including an major flare event on top of the @xmath0-ray high state , which occurred within vp  423 and lasted for about 2 days ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we searched the comptel data for a possible simultaneous mev flare , by subdividing vp 423 according to the egret light curve in 3 parts : a pre - flare ( tjd 9888.8 - 9892.7 ) , on - flare ( tjd 9892.7 - 9894.7 ) , and post - flare part ( tjd 9894.7 - 9898.6 ) . the fluxes for the on - flare and post - flare part are higher than the other 10 - 30  mev fluxes indicating the presence of the flare also at mev energies ( fig .",
    "we note , however , that the highest comptel flux is found after the flare in the egret band had already vanished .",
    "this indicates a possible time delay of a few days between the two bands in the sense that the higher energies come first .",
    "we have added the comptel data of the 4-week high - state period to generate an average mev spectrum . due to the non - detections below 3 mev",
    "only 2 spectral points are derived , which , nevertheless , indicate a hard ( @xmath2 @xmath32 , @xmath4@xmath5 ) spectrum of pks  1622 - 297 at mev energies ( fig .",
    "we also generated the simultaneous egret spectrum of pks  1622 - 297 , which is between 30  mev and 10  gev sufficiently fitted by a power - law shape with a photon index of @xmath42.2 . if the simultaneous egret and comptel spectra are combined ( fig .",
    "4 ) , a spectral break at mev energies becomes obvious .",
    "a fit of this simultaneous egret and comptel spectrum with a broken power - law model indicates the break energy to be around 20  mev . due to the marginal comptel detections below 10  mev , the amount of the spectral break , i.e. the change in photon index from the higher to the lower energies , is not well determined .",
    "its lower limit , however , should be larger than 0.6 .",
    "after the @xmath0-ray activity of pks  1622 - 297 had been recognized by egret , a too observation ( vp  423.5 ) was carried out , where osse participated .",
    "this provided the possibility to measure the spectrum down to 0.05  mev .",
    "mattox et al . ( 1997 ) reported that the osse and egret data itself can be represented by power - law shapes with similar photon indices of 2.0@xmath70.2 and 2.2@xmath70.1 , respectively ( fig .",
    "however , fitting a simple power - law shape to the combined osse / egret data , they obtained a photon spectral index of 1.87@xmath70.02 .",
    "we have analysed the comptel data of vp  423.5 and have added the spectral results to this combined osse - egret spectrum ( fig .",
    "although these comptel data are not really constraining , they  at first glance  support a more complex spectral shape at @xmath0-ray energies than the simple power - law model .",
    "in general , pks  1622 - 297 shows a similar behaviour as is observed in other such sources , like pks  0528 + 134 and 3c  279 for example . during flaring events observed by egret ,",
    "pks  1622 - 297 is detected  predominantly  at the upper comptel energies , resulting in a hard mev spectrum and showing a spectral break in the combined comptel - egret spectrum .",
    "these facts indicate that the flare is more efficient at higher @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "such a behaviour can generally be explained in a multi - component @xmath0-ray emission scenario , consisting of synchrotron - self compton and external comptonization components . because they have different dependencies on the bulk lorentz factor , a change in bulk lorentz factor could result in increased emission at mainly the higher - energy @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , bttcher @xmath8 collmar 1998 ) .",
    "on top of the already high @xmath0-ray level , pks  1622 - 297 showed a major flare which lasted for a few days .",
    "comptel measures enhanced @xmath0-ray emission during this period .",
    "this suggests that the flare is also visible at mev energies , however with reduced amplitude .",
    "an intriguing feature of this flare is the possible time delay of a few days between the @xmath0-rays above 100  mev and the 10 - 30 mev band , indicating that the opacity of the @xmath0-ray emitting region might be different for the different energy bands .",
    "such a delay has not yet been observed in another blazar .",
    "a measurement of this delay , together with the ratio of the flare amplitudes in the different bands , has the potential to improve our insights on the @xmath0-ray emitting region .",
    "during a 4-week @xmath0-ray acitivity period observed at energies above 100  mev by egret , pks  1622 - 297 is also significantly detected at lower - energy @xmath0-rays ( @xmath610  mev ) by comptel .",
    "this detection together with the marginal detection and non - detection at lower comptel energies indicates a hard ( @xmath2 @xmath32 , @xmath4@xmath5 ) mev spectrum .",
    "the combined comptel - egret spectrum requires a spectral break around @xmath420  mev .    on top of this @xmath0-ray high state",
    ", egret observed a major flare which lasted for about 2  days .",
    "comptel observes enhanced mev emission ( 10 - 30 mev band ) during that time .",
    "however , the comptel flux is still high when the egret one is already down , indicating a possible time delay of a few days between the two bands .",
