    "we stress that the contamination fractions discussed in the previous paragraphs are _ estimates _ ; the true contamination could be different if the sample of apokasc stars with evolutionary - state measurements does not accurately represent the parent apokasc sample , or if the apokasc sample does not reflect the rc and rgb populations in the _ kepler _ field @xcite or in other parts of the galaxy$ ]  with respect to the solar value .",

    "this shows that the sample spans a large area of the galactic disk near the midplane .",
    "as a spectroscopic survey observing a relatively small number of objects in the photometric 2mass catalog , apogee  requires decisions as to what lines of sight to observe , what types of stars to target in the chosen directions , and how to sample these stars as a function of their photometric properties .",
    "these decisions affect how the underlying photometric sample is reflected in the spectroscopic data . to connect the high - dimensional distribution ( or moments thereof ) of positions , velocities , and elemental abundances found in the spectroscopic sample to the distribution of _ all _ stars",
    "it is necessary to correct for the effects of the selection ( often referred to as _ selection biases _ ) , beyond the obvious angular selection function encased in the apogee pointings ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : obsprogress ] ) .",
    "generally , the relation between the spectroscopic sampling on the underlying galactic population can be divided into three parts ( see sec .  4 of @xcite ) : ( a ) the procedure by which the survey selects stars from all potential targets , ( b ) the relation between the kinds of stars observed and the full underlying stellar population , and ( c ) the relation of the observed spatial volume ( typically a small number of lines of sight ) to the global volume .",
    "the last point requires one to extrapolate the observed stellar distribution in the observed lines of sight to the large volume between lines of sight ; one must assume that spatial gradients in the underlying distribution are well sampled by the observed lines of sight , and one needs to estimate these gradients , which can be done by modeling the spatial dependence of the stellar distribution within the observed field pointings .",
    "however , as this last step requires extensive modeling of the observed distributions , we do not discuss it here further ( see @xcite and @xcite for an example of this procedure ) .",

    ". we will refer to this sample as apogee s _ main sample _",
    ", reserving the name _ statistical sample _ for the part of the main sample for which observations are complete ( defined as the observations having a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath32 per half - resolution element ) .",
    "+   +    for the purposes of describing the details of the apogee  target selection , it is necessary to give a brief description of the basic data - collecting process ( see also the _ glossary _ in appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "apogee  observes stars in a set of _ fields _ , which are circular locations on the sky with a radius of @xmath195 ; see figure  [ fig : obsprogress ] for the location of all of these fields .",
    "fields are observed in one `` visit '' sessions for up to 24 visit ; each visit consists of a @xmath196 observation .",
    "the vast majority of fields are observed for three visits only , some fields are observed for only 1 visit ( most fields in the _ kepler _ field , most fields in the galactic bulge , and fields targeting the core of the sgr dwarf galaxy ) , and others are observed for six , twelve , or twenty - four visits .",
    "the main sample for fields observed for three visits or less consists of a single magnitude _",
    "cohort_. other fields have either two or three magnitude cohorts , corresponding to two or three magnitude ranges .",
    "typically , the brightest cohort , known as the _ short cohort _ , has @xmath197 , the intermediate _ medium cohort _ has @xmath198 , and the _ long cohort _ has @xmath199 or @xmath200 , depending on whether the field is observed for 12 or 24 visits ; we refer to this cohort distribution as the _ standard cohort distribution_. the main exceptions to this rule are fields with a single one - visit cohort , for which the short cohort has @xmath201 ; some of the bulge fields with a single - visit cohort have a medium cohort that has @xmath202 .",
    "to a good approximation , we can assume that within each cohort s magnitude range , the color and magnitude are sampled uniformly from the underlying population - th star is observed , with @xmath101 chosen such as to provide the desired total number of targets in each cohort .",
    "while these schemes are not entirely random , the large number of stars combined with the 2mass magnitude errors and some stars not being observed because of practical observational reasons serve to make this sampling nearly indistinguishable from a random sampling ( see figure  [ fig : sfks]).[foot : nth ] ] . for the purpose of the discussion",
    ", we will assume the standard cohort distribution .    in fields observed for six visits or more ,",
    "there are multiple three - visit short cohorts ( one for every three visits ) , and for fields observed for 12 visits or more there are multiple medium cohorts ( one for every six visits ) ; there is only ever a single long cohort per field .",
    "a _ design _ consists of a three - visit set of targets : this contains a short cohort with a unique set of targets , a medium cohort with targets shared among two designs , and a long cohort with targets shared among all designs for a given field ( see figure 1 in @xcite for a visual representation of different designs for a given field ) .",
    "a three - visit field has a single design ; a six - visit field has two designs , with a different short cohort on each design and a shared medium cohort ; and a 12- or 24-visit field has four or eight designs , with four or eight unique short cohorts , two or four medium cohorts , and a single long cohort .",
    "each design is implemented as a set of spectroscopic plates , which corresponds to a physical plug - plate loaded onto the telescope .",
    "a design may be used on a single plate or on multiple plates .",
    "plates are observed in one - visit increments . for the purpose of determining the selection function ,",
    "we only consider plates for which all planned observations were complete by the deadline for dr11 ( august 1 , 2013 ) . figure  [ fig : obsprogress ] shows the fraction of completed plates for short , medium , and long cohorts out of all planned plates as part of apogee s three - year run . near the disk ,",
    "observations have high completeness , except for the region @xmath203 .",
    "using the mapping between plates , designs , and cohorts , we can determine for which fields and cohorts all of the observations for a set of stars are complete .",
    "as an example , for a twelve - visit field , we can determine which of its four different short - cohort sets of targets have been observed to completion , the same for its two different medium - cohorts sets of targets , and for its single long cohort . for the purpose of building a _ statistical sample _ , we then ignore all spectroscopic targets for which observations have not reached the full exposure time ( such stars are present in the apogee  data products ) . for each combination of a field and a cohort",
    "s magnitude range apogee  provides a random sampling of the underlying photometric sample .",
    "the selection function for a field and magnitude - range combination is therefore simply given by the number of stars in the statistical sample in this field and magnitude range , divided by the number of stars in the photometric sample in the same field and magnitude range .",
    "for example @xmath204 and similarly for the medium and long magnitude ranges for each field .",
    "thus , for each field the selection function is piecewise constant with jumps at the magnitude limits of the ( up to three ) cohorts of each field .",
    "+    to determine whether the piecewise - constant model for the selection function is a good approximation , we compare the magnitude distribution of stars in the statistical spectroscopic sample to that of stars in the photometric sample within the same field and magnitude range .",
    "this comparison is done for the up to three different cohort - magnitude - ranges of each field separately . in each field and magnitude - range combination ,",
    "the selection function model is that the statistical sample is a fair sampling of the underlying photometric distribution of targets , and this model is tested by computing the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) probability that the statistical sample distribution of @xmath28-band magnitudes is the same as that of the photometric sample .",
    "a histogram of these probabilities is shown in figure  [ fig : sfks ] .",
    "the vast majority of ks probabilities of the short cohorts are large , such that the hypothesis that the statistical sample was drawn from the photometric sample can not be rejected ; the few fields whose short cohort has a small ks probability are consistent with random noise ( out of 102 short cohorts , one expects @xmath205 to have a ks probability @xmath206 and we find @xmath207 ) .",
    "the medium and long cohorts also mostly have large ks probabilities , with the 1 out of 41 medium cohorts and 0 out of 25 long cohorts with @xmath208 , consistent with random statistical fluctuations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the piecewise - linear model of equation  ( [ eq : sf ] ) is a good model for the selection function .",
    "we do caution that the ks probabilities of medium and long cohorts are somewhat _ too consistent _ with the underlying distribution , which likely results from the non - random ` @xmath101'-th - star sampling used ( see footnote [ foot : nth ] ) for these cohorts .",
    "however , due to photometric magnitude errors , the spectroscopic sampling is still an effectively - random sampling of the intrinsic magnitude distribution ( i.e. , that which one would observe without errors ) .    the distributions in color @xmath85 and magnitude @xmath28 of the photometric sample in fields and",
    "magnitude ranges contained in the statistical sample are shown as the density grayscale and black contours and histograms in figure  [ fig : colormagsf ] .",
    "this distribution clearly shows the influence of the cohort magnitude limits at @xmath209 , and @xmath210 ( there are currently no completed 24 visit fields that would reach @xmath211 ) .",
    "the fiber allocation to different cohorts is such that stars in the fainter magnitude bins are over - represented with respect to the brightest bin , such that the magnitude distribution as well as the color distribution of the statistical sample ( shown as red dashed contours and histograms ) is weighted to fainter magnitudes and bluer colors .",
    "the latter happens because , even though the color sampling is random over the same color range for all magnitude ranges , the intrinsic correlation between color and magnitude in the photometric sample leads to an apparent bias in the color distribution of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "using the model for the selection function described above , we can re - weight stars in the photometric sample such that they trace the sampling of the spectroscopic sample , and this distribution is shown as blue dash - dotted contours and histograms .",
    "it is clear that correcting for the selection function leads to perfect agreement between the re - weighted photometric sample and the statistical spectroscopic sample .",
    "the selection function is a function of location on the sky ( field location , or equivalently , galactic longitude and latitude ) and @xmath28-band magnitude . to determine the spatial selection function requires understanding how distances relate to dereddened @xmath212 magnitudes and what the extinction is as a function of distance for a given line of sight . to get a sense of how the milky way spatial volume is sampled by the rc sample of stars described in this paper",
    ", we show the selection function as a function of position in figure  [ fig : sfxyrz ] , assuming a rc absolute @xmath28-band magnitude of @xmath213 @xcite , and using the median @xmath214 for the stars in the statistical sample in each line of sight ( in reality , the extinction will be less closer to the sun and greater at the faint end , so the spatial sampling will cover a slightly smaller range than shown here ) .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the statistical subsample of the rc sample presented in this paper provides a large - scale sampling of the milky way volume near the disk that is useful for statistical analyses of the distribution of elemental abundances in the milky way disk .",
    "+    the second ingredient for relating the observed spectroscopic sample of stars to the underlying galactic stellar populations is to determine how the spectroscopic tracer  rc stars in our case  relates to the full population .",
    "the rc stage in the evolution of stars with metallicities around solar is a relatively short phase for stars with masses of approximately @xmath215 to @xmath216 lasting for about @xmath217 . as such",
    ", the chance of finding stars in this stage of stellar evolution is small compared to the total lifetime of the stars , and only a small fraction of stars of a given age and metallicity will at any given time find themselves within the rc bounds given in @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "however , the rc is a relatively _ long _ phase compared to other evolved stages and in that respect the rc is perhaps the best population tracer among giants . in this section ,",
    "we use the parsec stellar - isochrone models to determine the properties of stars in our rc selection region and how they relate to the full stellar population .",
    "overall , the rc selection defined in this paper excludes stars with ( a ) metallicities @xmath218 and ( b ) ages @xmath219 .",
    "these are primarily due to the apogee color cut and the subsequent cuts in equations  ( [ eq : jkzcuts ] ) , ( [ eq : jkzcuts3 ] ) , and ( [ eq : jkzcuts2 ] ) .",
    "blue @xmath220 cut excludes rc stars with low metallicities : equation  ( [ eq : jkzcuts ] ) evaluated at @xmath221 gives a lower limit for the metallicity of @xmath222 .",
    "the additional blue cut in equations  ( [ eq : jkzcuts3 ] ) eliminates secondary - red - clump stars with ages @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the rc selection in this paper selects intermediate - age and old stars in the milky way disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : astrosf - mass ] shows the average initial mass of a star in the rc selection region defined in @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "the typical mass is relatively constant as a function of metallicity and is smaller for larger ages . for a constant sfh ,",
    "the average mass is @xmath224 for near - solar metallicities and declines to about @xmath225 at @xmath66}}\\approx -1 $ ] .",
    "however , the average mass is sensitive to the sfh : for an exponentially - declining sfh with an @xmath226-folding time of @xmath227 , starting at @xmath228 , the average mass is @xmath229 lower than that for a constant sfh for all metallicities . for an old population of stars , the average mass drops to @xmath230 .",
    "the average mass can therefore change by about @xmath231 depending on the sfh .    because the rc stage ( roughly the phase of core helium burning , but our considerations in this section are purely based on the selection criteria from @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] )",
    "is relatively short ( @xmath232 ) , the fraction of stars of a single - burst stellar population ( assuming here a lognormal @xcite imf ) contained in the rc selection region is small .",
    "the relative fraction of the mass of a single - burst stellar population contained in the rc , as a function of age and metallicity , is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : astrosf - frac ] .",
    "stars in the rc region are typically between one and four @xmath233 old ( see figure  [ fig : astrosf - age ] below ) and the relative mass fraction for ages above one @xmath234  is about @xmath235 , a small fraction of the stellar population s mass .",
    "similarly , the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : astrosf - frac ] displays the fraction of the total mass each star in the rc region represents ( this is equal to figure  [ fig : astrosf - mass ] divided by the top panel ) .",
    "the dependence on age and metallicity is similar to that of the relative mass fraction .",
    "integrating over a constant or exponentially - declining sfh , these mass fractions are approximately constant with metallicity , but depend at the @xmath236 to @xmath237 level on the sfh , as old populations contain relatively less of a stellar - population s mass in the rc region than younger populations .",
    "the varying mass fractions in figure  [ fig : astrosf - frac ] imply that the rc as defined in this paper does not randomly sample the underlying age distribution of stars , but is instead typically skewed toward younger ages ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : astrosf - age ] displays the relative probability , as a function of age , for stars in a stellar population that are present in the rc region .",
    "we calculate this probability using a metallicity distribution similar to that in the solar neighborhood ( that of @xcite , using the representation described in @xmath18  [ sec : distance ] ) and it can be approximated by the following functional form @xmath238\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] relative to a constant age distribution , the rc selection biases the sample to stars with ages between 1 and @xmath239 .",
    "we sample all ages in the disk older than this , but the distribution is cut off below about @xmath240 .",
    "this effect is in large part due to our selection cuts : our color ",
    "metallicity cuts in @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] exclude the bluest , youngest red - clump stars at a given metallicity , because their luminosity distribution is not sufficiently narrow to allow precise distances to be assigned for these stars .",
    "this is also the reason that the red - clump age distribution derived by @xcite peaks at lower ages and extends to younger red clump stars ; they considered the full red clump , whereas we only consider the part of the rc that is narrow in luminosity and which is typically older .",
    "the discussion in this section is based on parsec stellar - evolution models with mass loss on the giant branch modeled using the reimers law with an efficiency parameter of @xmath127 ( see @xmath18  [ sec : kde ] ) .",
    "while mass loss affects a star s mass during the rc phase , it neither influences the luminosity ( see @xmath18  [ sec : kde ] ) nor the lifetime of the rgb and rc phases .",
    "therefore , mass loss does not have any effect on how the rc samples the underlying stellar population .",
    "we have explicitly checked this by computing the total - stellar - population mass every rc star represents ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : astrosf - frac ] ) and the age sampling ( figure  [ fig : astrosf - age ] ) for parsec models with mass - loss efficiency parameters @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "we find small differences and in particular the age sampling of the rc is robust with respect to changes in @xmath243 .    from the discussion in this section ,",
    "it is clear that great care must be taken when using the rc as a spectroscopic tracer of the galactic stellar distribution function , because the fraction of a stellar population s mass contained in the rc region and the manner in which other properties are sampled depends on the sfh  or , equivalently , the age distribution .",
    "this is unavoidable when using evolved rather than main - sequence stars as stellar - population tracers ; as discussed at the start of this section , the rc is a relatively long phase in the evolution of post - main - sequence stars and is therefore among the best population - tracers among giants stars .",
    "the fact that the relation between the rc region and the full stellar population does not strongly depend on metallicity for a given sfh , combined with the fact that there is only a weak correlation observed in the solar neighborhood between age and metallicity @xcite , means that the rc sampling of the metallicity distribution of stellar populations older than one @xmath234  should be relatively uniform .",
    "however , age is not sampled uniformly ( see figure  [ fig : astrosf - age ] ) and the detailed distribution of elemental abundances likely depends strongly on age , such that detailed studies need to take the likely age distribution of the rc sample into account .",
    "in this section we discuss the construction of the apogee - rc catalog from the superset of data to be released as part of sdss - iii s dr11 and the contents of the catalog .",
    "we also briefly consider sources of proper motions for the catalog stars . because sdss - iii has a yearly data - release schedule",
    ", we do not release the apogee - rc catalog with this paper ; it will instead be part of the sdss - iii dr11 , currently scheduled for dec .",
    "2014 . at the time of writing this dec .",
    "2014 release is planned to also contain the full three - year apogee data as part of dr12 . for public use",
    ", the dr11 apogee - rc catalog will therefore immediately be made obsolete by the dr12 apogee - rc catalog .",
    "full details on how to obtain the apogee - rc catalog and what it contains will be given in the dr11/dr12 documentation .",
    "the starting point is the catalog of all unique stars observed spectroscopically , and to be released as part of dr11 . for these stars ,",
    "we calculate extinction - corrected 2mass @xmath244 magnitudes , using the extinction corrections derived by the rjce method @xcite for apogee  stars ( we use the extinction corrections calculated prior to target selection , for consistency ) .",
    "we then employ the calibrated metallicities and surface gravities using the corrections of @xcite and convert the metallicity @xmath57 $ ]  to metal mass fraction @xmath13 assuming @xmath245 and solar abundance ratios .",
    "the dereddened color @xmath85 , @xmath59 , @xmath55  and metallicity @xmath13 are then used to select rc stars using the cuts described in @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "we also apply the additional @xmath59@xmath55  cut of equation  ( [ eq : addllogg ] ) .",
    "stars selected in this way constitute the full dr11 apogee  red - clump ( apogee - rc ) catalog .",
    "this sample consists of 10,341  stars .",
    "the absolute @xmath168-band magnitudes for all of the rc stars are calculated using the model for @xmath87 shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : sig_jkz ] , corrected for the calibration offset determined in @xmath18  [ sec : distance ] . using the selection function from @xmath18  [ sec : ssf ] , we also determine which rc stars are part of the statistical sample .",
    "the apogee - rc catalog contains all of the basic data derived from the apogee spectra , such as the line - of - sight velocity , @xmath55 , @xmath59 , @xmath57 $ ] , as well as other abundances measured from the spectra .",
    "we also include photometry from 2mass , extinction corrections , apogee targeting information , pipeline flags , and apogee identifiers to allow the objects in the apogee - rc catalog to be matched to the full apogee catalog .",
    "full high - resolution spectra can be obtained from the sdss - iii database by using the apogee identifiers .",
    "we include distances derived from the absolute @xmath120  magnitudes and , for convenience , we add galactocentric coordinates calculated assuming @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the distance distribution of the apogee - rc sample is presented in figure  [ fig : disthist ] .",
    "the distribution of the sample in the volume around the sun and in galactocentric coordinates is shown in figure  [ fig : distdist ] .",
    "these distributions demonstrate that the sample is dominated by disk stars at @xmath248 , but the sample also contains some stars in the stellar halo . because the rc is faint relative to more luminous red - giant apogee  targets and as bulge fields are typically limited to @xmath249 or @xmath34 , there are relatively few bulge stars contained in this sample",
    ".      we have added matches to the ucac-4 @xcite and ppmxl @xcite proper - motion catalogs .",
    "however , the usefulness of these catalogs , which have proper motions uncertainties @xmath250 ( both statistical and systematic ) , for the apogee - rc sample is extremely limited .",
    "stars in the apogee - rc catalog have typical distances of a few @xmath2  ( see figure  [ fig : disthist ] ) . at these distances and farther , galactic rotation typically leads to proper motions of @xmath251 , while random motions@xmath252 and smaller at larger distances from the galactic center  lead to proper motions of about @xmath253 . therefore , at a few @xmath2  the proper motion uncertainties are similar or greater than the intrinsic proper motions and the systematic uncertainties in these proper motion catalogs make extracting proper - motions signals out of the noise difficult .",
    "the _ gaia _ astrometric space mission , launched on dec .",
    "19 2013 , will measure proper motions with precisions better than @xmath254 for all stars with _ gaia _ @xmath255 over its five - year mission .",
    "as @xmath256 is a white - light optical bandpass it is much more strongly affected by dust extinction than the infrared apogee  observations ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "we estimate the _ gaia _ @xmath256-band magnitudes of stars in the apogee - rc sample by using the parsec isochrones in the sdss and 2mass passbands in the rc region defined in @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] and using the transformation between @xmath258 , @xmath259 and @xmath256 of table 5 of @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath260 from @xmath261 as @xmath262 inspired by the data of @xcite . for a given extinction @xmath214",
    "we calculate the extinction in the _ gaia _ band using the highest extinction entry in table 8 of @xcite and assuming @xmath263 .",
    "we then use the projected astrometric performance as a function of @xmath264 from the _ gaia _ performance website to calculate the proper - motion precision . the resulting expected precision in the transverse motion based on the _ gaia _ proper motions at different apparent magnitudes and for different amounts of extinction is shown in figure  [ fig : gaiapm ] .",
    "these precisions only include the effect of the proper motion uncertainty ; additional uncertainty comes from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 rc distance uncertainty .",
    "the variation at a given magnitude in this figure is due to the spread in @xmath256 and @xmath260 in the rc region for a given magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaiapm ] shows that , even at large extinctions , most stars in the apogee - rc catalog will be bright enough to have _ gaia _ proper motions , with only the faintest and most heavily extincted stars falling below the @xmath265 _ gaia _ magnitude limit .",
    "therefore , _",
    "gaia _ will provide highly - precise proper motions for the vast majority of our sample , leading to errors in the transverse velocity @xmath266 . at the time of writing ,",
    "_ gaia _ is expected to release preliminary proper motions 28 months after launch using 20 months of data .",
    "the proper motion uncertainties in that first data release are expected to be worse by a factor of @xmath267 ( @xmath268^{-3/2}$ ] ) . even with these larger uncertainties ,",
    "most stars in the apogee - rc sample will have sub-@xmath269 proper motions and most will have uncertainties below @xmath270 , or @xmath271 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : gaiaplx ] we display the expected _ gaia _ relative parallax precision for stars in the apogee - rc catalog , computed in a similar way as the proper motion uncertainties above ( the expected end - of - missio proper motion uncertainties are half the expected parallax uncertainties ) .",
    "the parallaxes that will be available in the launch+28 months release will have uncertainties that are larger by a factor of @xmath272 ( @xmath268^{-1/2}$ ] ) .",
    "the spectro - photometric rc distances computed in sections [ sec : sample ] and [ sec : distance ] are more precise than the _ gaia _ parallaxes for all but the brightest stars that do not suffer from much extinction ; these bright rc stars will be highly informative for an improved calibration of the rc distances",
    ". however , for many rc candidates , the _ gaia _ parallaxes could distinguish between true rc stars or rgb interlopers by comparing the spectro - photometric distance to the parallax .",
    "the rc catalog with high - resolution abundances and very accurate distances will allow the distribution of abundances in the milky way s disk to be mapped in unprecedented detail .",
    "as an illustration of this capability , we discuss in this section spatial variations in the median metallicity close to the midplane of the milky way s disk .",
    "because there is a strong radial metallicity gradient for the intermediate - age stars in the rc catalog ( see below ) , the average metallicity can be used as a tracer of the orbits of stars with different mean orbital radii .",
    "for example , if closed orbits in the mw disk are non - circular ( e.g. , elliptical as discussed below ) , then the azimuthal dependence of the radius of a closed orbit maps into an azimuthal dependence of the average @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "non - steady - state non - axisymmetric flows , such as those induced by growth of the galactic bar or transient spiral structure , can also be traced by azimuthal @xmath57 $ ]  variations , because the inhomogeneities in the @xmath57 $ ]  distribution induced by these perturbations will remain visible for multiple dynamical times . as a specific example , recent simulations of the evolution of galactic disks @xcite have shown that for galaxies with a radial metallicity gradient , the presence ( or absence ) of azimuthal metallicity variations in the stars can constrain recent radial mixing induced by the bar .",
    "mixing induced by transient spiral structure @xcite would lead to smaller , but similar effects .",
    "such mixing would induce azimuthal @xmath57 $ ]  variations of comparable magnitude to the radial variations that last for @xmath273 .",
    "we start by showing the radial midplane metallicity gradient in figure  [ fig : fehgrad ] , specifically the median metallicity as a function of galactocentric radius for all stars in the rc catalog contained within @xmath274 from the midplane .",
    "the data can be well fit by a single linear relation ( except for a discrepant point at @xmath275 ) with a slope of @xmath276 and a local normalization at @xmath246 of @xmath277 .",
    "thus , the median metallicity in the solar neighborhood is approximately solar and the metallicity gradient is quite steep for stars that are typically between @xmath215 and @xmath278 old ( see @xmath18  [ sec : astrosf ] ) .",
    "this measurement agrees with previous determinations of the metallicity gradient of intermediate - age stars ( see @xcite , and references therein ) and open clusters older than @xmath279 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+    the rc catalog covers a region around the sun that spans about @xmath280 in galactocentric azimuth @xmath281 , allowing the mapping of the median metallicity in both @xmath12 and @xmath281 .",
    "we extend the range in vertical heights to include all stars in the rc catalog within @xmath282 from the midplane such that we can use small pixels in @xmath12 and @xmath281 , as allowed by our precise distances .",
    "figure  [ fig : fehaz ] presents the two - dimensional behavior of the median metallicity in rectangular coordinates .",
    "figure  [ fig : fehaz2 ] shows the azimuthal metallicity residuals with respect to the median metallicity at each radius in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the typical uncertainty in the median metallicity of a given two - dimensional spatial pixel is about @xmath283 .",
    "the residual map in figure  [ fig : fehaz2 ] clearly demonstrates that there are no significant azimuthal variations within the observed octant above the uncertainty of @xmath283 ; deviations that are present have a standard deviation of @xmath283 .",
    "remarkably , this constraint is more than an order of magnitude tighter than the radial variation of the metallicity ( figure  [ fig : fehgrad ] ) .",
    "this is the first time that azimuthal variations in the metallicity distribution of intermediate - age stars have been constrained .",
    "previous investigations of azimuthal gradients in the abundance distribution of young tracers of the disk ( ages @xmath284 ) have obtained mixed results , with some studies seeing variations @xcite , while others do not @xcite .",
    "because young tracers have ages that are not much larger than the rotational period ( @xmath285 ; see below ) , their azimuthal distribution likely more strongly reflects their birth properties than dynamical stellar mixing .",
    "the opposite is the case for the rc stars that we use , which are all older than @xmath286 and are typically @xmath287 ( figure  [ fig : astrosf - age ] ) .",
    "the absence of significant variations in the median metallicity with galactocentric azimuth limits the extent to which closed orbits in the galactic disk are non - circular . as an example we consider that the mw disk is elliptical due to a @xmath288 perturbation @xmath289 to the potential @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the dimensionless amplitude of the perturbation ,",
    "@xmath292 is the circular velocity , and @xmath293 is a position angle @xcite ; we assume that the unperturbed circular velocity curve is flat , i.e. , @xmath294 .",
    "the ellipticity of the equipotential surfaces and of the closed orbits is @xmath295 .",
    "such ellipticity in the mw is only mildly constrained , especially if the sun lies near the minor or major axis of the perturbation @xcite , but ellipticities of @xmath296 are common in external mw - like galaxies @xcite . if @xmath297 in the mw , then there will be coherent non - circular flows with an amplitude of @xmath298 and estimates of the circular velocity could be impacted by similar amounts @xcite .",
    "elliptical motions that lead to radial variations larger than @xmath299 along closed orbits within the @xmath300 azimuthal region near the sun lead to @xmath301 azimuthal variations in the average metallicity .",
    "as we do not observe such variations , these closed orbits are disfavored by the data .",
    "specifically , we consider any elliptical closed orbit that leads to @xmath302 for any of the @xmath303 between @xmath304 and @xmath305 to be ruled out .",
    "we present these constraints in figure  [ fig : ellip ] .",
    "this figure uses an alternative parameterization of the elliptical - disk potential where the perturbation is split into a component @xmath306 that is symmetric with respect to the sun ",
    "galactic - center line and a component @xmath307 that is asymmetric .",
    "elliptical models where the sun lies on the major or minor axis ( @xmath308 and @xmath309 and @xmath310 , respectively ) are much less constrained than models where the sun is in between the major and minor axis ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "this is because for the latter models @xmath312 is almost entirely monotonic with @xmath281 within the observed region , such that large @xmath313 occur ; if the sun lies near the major or minor axis , much smaller @xmath313 exist .",
    "models where the sun lies near the minor axis are the least constrained , with large @xmath314 allowed by the data . in such models the closed orbit at the sun s position has a rotational velocity that is larger than the average , axisymmetric @xmath292 by @xmath315 ; offsets up to @xmath316 are allowed by these data . in particular , a model where the closed orbit near the sun is ahead of the average @xmath292 by @xmath317 as proposed by @xcite to explain the apogee stellar kinematics in the disk , is allowed ; this model is indicated in figure  [ fig : ellip ] by a white cross .",
    "rc data from the final year of apogee combined with data from apogee-2 will extend the mapping of azimuthal @xmath57 $ ]  variations over at least @xmath318 to @xmath319 .",
    "this mapping will allow limits on @xmath320 and @xmath321 that are @xmath322 .",
    "if the milky way s bar or spiral structure now or in the recent past had induced significant radial mixing of stars , this generically leads to azimuthal variations over similar spatial scales .",
    "the fact that we observe azimuthal metallicity variations to be smaller than the radial metallicity variation over @xmath323 ( the metallicity gradient is @xmath324 or @xmath325 ) , indicates that no significant radial mixing over these spatial scales has recently occurred ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this in the context of mixing induced by a bar ; see also the azimuthal variations in the density of migrating stars in figure 10 in @xcite ) ; specifically , @xmath326 of stars can have migrated @xmath327 with @xmath328 near the sun .",
    "any azimuthal variation will smooth out after the mixing ends .",
    "because the milky way s rotation curve is approximately flat in the region where we map the median metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath329 , such fluctuations over a scale @xmath330 across an azimuthal range @xmath331 near the sun would disappear in approximately @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is the rotational period ( @xmath334 ) and @xmath335 is the spread in guiding - star radii ( @xmath336 near @xmath11 or about @xmath337 for the intermediate - age disk ; @xcite ) . for fluctuations below",
    "@xmath337 over the @xmath280 range probed by the dr11 apogee - rc catalog , this timescale is approximately @xmath338 near the sun and about @xmath237 larger in the outer disk regions shown in figure  [ fig : fehaz2 ] .",
    "therefore , our constraints on mixing on kpc scales apply to approximately the last @xmath233 of the mw s evolution .",
    "however , quantitative constraints on realistic migration scenarios will require more detailed modeling of the azimuthal signature of radial migration , its dissolution over time , and its observability within the apogee survey volume .    the absence of azimuthal variations in the median metallicity can also be used to constrain distance systematics .",
    "any systematic distance offsets in the rc sample would induce azimuthal gradients in metallicity : such offsets would distort rings of stars at constant @xmath12 onto a locus spanning a range of apparent @xmath339 , with a strong correlation between @xmath340 and azimuth @xmath281",
    ". the metallicity distribution of stars at a constant apparent @xmath339 would therefore show apparent azimuthal variations that correspond to the real radial variations . changing all of the distances in the rc catalog by @xmath237 upward or downward",
    "induces clear azimuthal variations at large and small @xmath12 , respectively . _ assuming that there are no intrinsic azimuthal variations _ , this result excludes such large distance systematics .",
    "smaller distance systematics induce smaller azimuthal gradients , and azimuthal variations over the volume probed by the rc catalog are minimized for distance systematics within a few percent of the distances that we assigned in @xmath18  [ sec : distance ] ( using the maximum of the median absolute azimuthal deviations @xmath341}}$ ] in @xmath342 bins to quantify the accuracy of the distances ) .",
    "thus , we conclude from this test that the distances in the rc catalog are accurate to a few percent , in agreement with the considerations in @xmath18  [ sec : distance ] . because contamination by rgb stars at significantly different distances ( typical differences of @xmath343 ) would lead to distance systematics",
    ", this test also indicates that the overall rgb contamination must be @xmath344 , in accordance with the direct contamination estimates using asteroseismic evolutionary - state classifications in @xmath18  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "we have presented a new method for selecting individual likely rc stars from spectro - photometric data .",
    "this approach was used to produce a sample of rc stars with high purity from the apogee data set .",
    "the selection technique is a combination of simple cuts in @xmath345}},[j-{\\ensuremath{k_s}}]_0)$ ] motivated using stellar isochrone models and calibrated using high - quality seismic @xmath59  data from a subsample of apogee stars with measured oscillation frequencies from _ kepler_. these cuts in particular select rc stars for which the intrinsic absolute - magnitude distribution is very narrow ( @xmath346 ) , such that highly precise distances for these stars can be obtained .",
    "tests using _ kepler _ stars for which the evolutionary state was measured from their photometric variability show that the purity of the sample is @xmath347 . using stellar isochrone models we calculate the small ( @xmath348 ) deviations from a standard candle rc magnitude and we calibrate the distances against rc stars in _",
    "hipparcos_. this procedure results in distances that are unbiased to within @xmath187 and have random uncertainties of @xmath188 .",
    "we produce the apogee - rc catalog using the new rc selection method and distance calculation .",
    "this catalog is currently based on sdss dr11 , and contains 10,341  stars with accurate and precise distances , stellar parameters , and elemental abundances .",
    "the catalog will be released publicly as part of the public combined dr11/dr12 data release ( currently scheduled for dec .",
    "2014 ) ; full details on the contents of the catalog will be given in the documentation accompanying this data release .",
    "future data releases of sdss - iv will expand the current rc catalog and the data it contains .",
    "the apogee target selection and the subsequent rc selection introduces biases in the way the underlying stellar populations are represented in the sample .",
    "these biases are important for many detailed investigations of the abundance structure of the disk and need to be corrected for .",
    "as discussed in @xmath18  [ sec : ssf ] , we have determined the manner in which stars in the rc catalog were selected from the underlying 2mass photometry for a subsample of stars for which this is possible .",
    "selection weights for this statistical sample are included in the catalog and code that evaluates the selection function will be made publicly available with the release of the catalog . beyond this first bias",
    "are the astrophysical selection effects due to the fact that rc stars as any other kind of giants are an age- and metallicity - biased tracer of the underlying populations .",
    "these effects are discussed in detail in @xmath18  [ sec : astrosf ] . the main conclusion from this analysis",
    "are that the biases are relatively constant with metallicity for a given star - formation history , but they depend at the @xmath236 level on the star - formation history",
    ".    the rc catalog will be useful for exploring the full stellar distribution function of spatial location , kinematics , and abundances in the milky way disk , because of the large volume covered by the data , the precise distances permitting study of the smooth structure and any substructure to be resolved , and the availability of a large number of elemental abundances from the high - resolution apogee spectra . in @xmath18  [",

    "<S> the sloan digital sky survey iii s apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) is a high - resolution near - infrared spectroscopic survey covering all of the major components of the galaxy , including the dust - obscured regions of the inner milky way disk and bulge . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a sample of 10,341  likely red - clump stars ( rc ) from the first two years of apogee operations , selected based on their position in color  metallicity  </S>",
    "<S> surface - gravity  effective - temperature space using a new method calibrated using stellar - evolution models and high - quality asteroseismology data . </S>",
    "<S> the narrowness of the rc locus in color  metallicity  </S>",
    "<S> luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the stars with an accuracy of @xmath0 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample extends to typical distances of about 3@xmath2  from the sun , with some stars out to 8@xmath2 , and spans a volume of approximately @xmath3 over @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the apogee red - clump ( apogee - rc ) catalog contains photometry from 2mass , reddening estimates , distances , line - of - sight velocities , stellar parameters and elemental abundances determined from the high - resolution apogee spectra , and matches to major proper motion catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the survey selection function for this data set and discuss how the rc selection samples the underlying stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we use this sample to limit any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the @xmath7 azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be @xmath8 , which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the radial metallicity gradient . </S>",
    "<S> this result constrains coherent non - axisymmetric flows within a few kpc from the sun . </S>"
