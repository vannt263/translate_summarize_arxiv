    "it has been recently pointed out that , when the evolution is chaotic , the trajectories predicted by newtonian mechanics are not good approximations to the special - relativistic trajectories , even for very small velocities , @xcite .",
    "the problem considered in refs .",
    "@xcite is the evolution of periodically delta - kicked systems with or without damping .",
    "the purpose of this letter is twofold : we want to extend the previous conclusion to another area of deterministic chaos ( chaotic scattering ) but also to point out that , for slow motion , newtonian mechanics can provide good approximations for global characteristics of chaotic systems , such as the structure and dimension of the non - attracting chaotic invariant set .",
    "we will consider a relativistic particle moving in an external potential energy @xmath0 .",
    "if particle s mass , position and linear momentum are @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , the hamiltonian ( i.e. , the total energy ) is @xmath4 and hamilton s canonical equations read as follows : @xmath5 where the lorentz factor is given by @xmath6 the newtonian equations of motion are recovered by putting @xmath7 , so that one might think they are a good approximation for slow motion , where @xmath8 .",
    "we will discuss in the next section to what extent is right this assumption in the case of chaotic scattering .",
    "let us consider a particle moving in the plane @xmath9 under the force derived from the potential @xcite @xmath10 the particle is sent from @xmath11 with initial velocity @xmath12 and after some time emerges from the scattering zone moving freely along a direction forming an angle @xmath13 with the positive @xmath14 axis . the initial velocity @xmath15 is computed from the conserved energy @xmath16 .",
    "we choose a system of units in which @xmath17 and a value of the energy @xmath18",
    "where @xmath19 is the height of the four maxima of the potential located at @xmath20 , so that the motion is slow , since the lorentz factor @xmath21 is always smaller than @xmath22 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have depicted 1000 values of the scattering function @xmath23 , in the range @xmath24 $ ] of the impact parameter @xmath25 , obtained by numerical integration @xcite of the relativistic equations of motion ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) and their newtonian approximation .     for the relativistic and newtonian equations of motion .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    first of all , one can see that while newtonian mechanics gives reasonably approximate results when the scattering function is smooth , when the latter is discontinuous the predictions of relativistic and newtonian equations of motions are very often completely different .",
    "this extends to chaotic scattering the claim in refs .",
    "@xcite that newtonian equation of motions are not a good approximation when _ individual _ chaotic trajectories have to be computed .    however , although the positions of individual points in the regions of chaotic scattering may be very different , the position of the discontinuity points along the @xmath25 axis seems to be very similar in both cases .",
    "this statement can be made quantitative if one computes the dimension of the cantor set of discontinuity points by using the method of the uncertainty exponent @xcite .",
    "we have computed the scattering function for @xmath26 values of @xmath27 $ ] and then selected a small value @xmath28 .",
    "we say that a value @xmath25 is _ certain _ if for the three impact parameters @xmath29 , @xmath25 and @xmath30 the scattering is upward or if it is downward for the three values .",
    "we repeat this for many values of @xmath25 and call @xmath31 to the proportion of uncertain values of @xmath25 .",

    ". in consequence @xcite , the fractal dimension of the set of discontinuity points is @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding plot for the newtonian approximation looks nearly identical with @xmath35 .",
    "this shows that the dimension of the chaotic invariant set is well approximated when computed with newtonian mechanics , if the velocities are small enough .     and a linear fit .",
    "in the previous section we have used newtonian mechanics in a consistent way , so that for each impact parameter @xmath25 the initial velocity @xmath15 is computed using the newtonian definition for the kinetic energy . since the latter is different in special relativity ,",
    "slightly different initial velocities were used in the newtonian and the relativistic simulations .",
    "if one uses the same initial velocities in both cases ( which implies slightly different energies ) , the results are very similar to those discussed above .",
    "for instance , one gets @xmath36 .",
    "we have shown that also in chaotic scattering newtonian mechanics fails to be a good approximation to compute individual trajectories . even for slow motion , the little relativistic corrections to the equations of motion , which remain small in non - chaotic scattering ,",
    "are greatly amplified by chaotic scattering during the long time in which the trajectory remains close to the non - attracting invariant set .",
    "this extends to chaotic scattering the conclusions reached in refs .",
    "however , we have also shown that some global properties , such as the structure and dimension of the set of discontinuity points ( and , thus , the dimension of the non - attracting chaotic invariant set ) are more robust and newtonian mechanics provides reasonably accurate approximations to them if the motion is slow enough .",
