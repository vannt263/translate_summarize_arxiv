    "in lagrangian mechanics a motion of a natural mechanical system is a geodesic line on a manifold - configuration space in the metric given by the difference of kinetic and potential energy .",
    "the configuration space for the fluid motion in a domain @xmath10 is the group @xmath0 of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding ( lie ) algebra is the algebra of divergence - free vector fields on @xmath10 vanishing on the boundary .",
    "the standard ( euler ) model of an ideal fluid corresponds to the kinetic energy being given by the @xmath11 norm of the fluid velocity on @xmath10 .",
    "that is , the right - invariant metric on @xmath0 is defined in the following way : its value at the identity of the group on a divergence - free vector field @xmath12 from the algebra is given by @xmath13 .",
    "recently , a number of papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) introduced the so called averaged euler equations for ideal incompressible flow on a manifold @xmath10 .",
    "the averaged euler equations involve a parameter @xmath9 ; one interpretation is that they are obtained by temporally averaging the euler equations in lagrangian representation over rapid fluctuations whose amplitudes are of order @xmath9 .",
    "the particle flows associated with these equations can be shown to be geodesics on a suitable group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms but with respect to a right invariant @xmath1 metric instead of the @xmath11 metric .",
    "the case of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of the two - dimensional torus with a right invariant @xmath11 metric was analyzed by arnold who showed ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that `` in many directions the sectional curvature is negative '' . in this paper",
    "we consider geodesic stability problem for the group @xmath14 with a right invariant @xmath1 metric which is related to the average euler flows .",
    "the instability discussed in this paper is the exponential _",
    "lagrangian _ instability of the motion of the fluid , not of its velocity field .",
    "a stationary flow can be a lyapunov stable solution of euler equations , while the corresponding motion of the fluid is exponentially unstable .",
    "the reason is that a small perturbation of the fluid velocity field can induce exponential divergence of fluid particles .",
    "here we review arnold s results for the group @xmath14 with a right invariant @xmath11 metric closely following @xcite . recall some standard notations .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the bilinear form on a lie algebra @xmath17 defined by the relation @xmath18 \\rangle$ ] , where @xmath19 @xmath20 $ ] is the commutator in @xmath17 and @xmath21 is the inner product in the space @xmath17 .",
    "the ( riemannian ) _ curvature tensor _ @xmath22 describes the infinitesimal transformation on a tangent space obtained by parallel translation around an infinitely small parallelogram . for @xmath23",
    ", the action of @xmath24 on @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of covariant differentiation as follows @xmath26 where @xmath27 are any fields whose values at the point @xmath28 are @xmath29 .",
    "the _ sectional curvature _ of @xmath10 in the direction of the two - plane spanned by any two vectors @xmath30 is the value @xmath31    theorem @xmath32 of @xcite gives explicit formulas for the inner product , commutator , operation @xmath16 , connection , and curvature of the right invariant @xmath11 metric on the group @xmath14 .",
    "these formulas allow one to calculate the sectional curvature in any two - dimensional direction .",
    "the divergence - free vector fields that constitute the lie algebra of the group @xmath14 can be described by their stream ( hamiltonian ) functions with zero mean ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , the lie algebra can be identified with the space of real functions on the torus having zero average value @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define such functions by their fourier coefficients and to carry out all calculations over @xmath34 .    complexifying the lie",
    "algebra one constructs a basis of this vector space using the functions @xmath35 ( where @xmath4 , called a _ wave vector _ , is a point of @xmath36 ) whose value at a point @xmath37 of our complex plane is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "this determines a function on the torus if the inner product @xmath39 is a multiple of @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "all such vectors @xmath4 belong to a lattice @xmath42 in @xmath36 , and the functions @xmath43 form a basis of the complexified lie algebra .    consider the parallel sinusoidal steady flow given by the stream function @xmath44 and let @xmath45 be any other vector of the algebra , i.e. @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "theorem @xmath48 of @xcite states that the curvature of the group @xmath49 in any two - dimensional plane containing the direction @xmath50 is _ non - positive _ and is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the ( oriented ) area of the parallelogram spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath54 is the area of the torus .",
    "then , a corollary of this theorem states that the curvature in the plane defined by the stream functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath59 is the angle between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in this section we present new results on the sectional curvature of the group of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of a two - torus with a right invariant @xmath1 metric in view of the application to the lagrangian stability analysis following arnold @xcite .",
    "the foundations for these results were established in @xcite where the continuous differentiability of the geodesic spray of @xmath1 metric on @xmath62 for an arbitrary riemannian manifold @xmath10 was proved .",
    "we start with an analog of theorem @xmath32 of @xcite .",
    "define an operator @xmath63 .",
    "it corresponds to the @xmath1 norm in the fourier space and is simply given by @xmath64 in the case @xmath65 when the @xmath1 metric effectively becomes the @xmath11 metric .",
    "the explicit formulas for the inner product , commutator , operation @xmath16 , and connection of the right invariant @xmath1 metric on the group @xmath14 have the following form : @xmath66 @xmath67 = ( k \\times",
    "l ) e_{k+l}\\ ] ] @xmath68 @xmath69    using the definition of the curvature tensor ( [ cur_def ] ) we obtain @xmath70    we do not write here the explicit expression for @xmath71 as it is rather involved , but we note that it is non - zero only in the case @xmath72 .",
    "we analyze a special case of the curvature in the plane defined by the stream functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( notice that the corresponding flow is a solution of the averaged euler equations ) . then the sectional curvature is determined only by two terms ( we ignore the scaling factor of the denominator in the definition ( [ sc_def ] ) ) : @xmath73 the computation gives an explicit formula @xmath74 which we rewrite in the following form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a function of @xmath77 and is strictly positive",
    "hence , the sign of the curvature is determined by the expression in the bracket , which is a cubic polynomial in @xmath78 : @xmath79 so that @xmath80 .",
    "numerical analysis of this complicated expression shows that the sectional curvature becomes positive for some values of @xmath6 when @xmath61 is small .",
    "( [ fig : curv ] ) is representative of a typical behavior of the curvature as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is small .",
    "based on this numerical evidence we analyze further analytically the case @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is small .",
    "compute the coefficients @xmath83 in ( [ poly ] ) as power series in @xmath84 @xmath85    notice that the coefficient of the highest degree is positive while all the rest are negative .",
    "hence , for @xmath86 it defines the leading term which increases with @xmath9 , while the other coefficients are responsible for initial decrease seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : curv ] ) .",
    "we summarize our result in the following theorem .",
    "consider the sectional curvature of the group @xmath14 equipped with the right invariant @xmath1 metric in the plane defined by the stream functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath87 .",
    "then , for @xmath88 sufficiently small , for any @xmath4 there is an @xmath89 , such that for all @xmath90 the corresponding sectional curvature is positive .",
    "the authors would like to thank jerrold e. marsden for helpful comments and the center for nonlinear science of los alamos national laboratory for providing a valuable setting where much of this work was performed ."
