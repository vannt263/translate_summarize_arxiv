    "an important information about perturbative operators is whether they are relevant , marginal or irrelevant . in general ,",

    "for an alternating nn exchange , a magnetization plateau is observed in small magnetic fields , but for alternating nnn exchange , it is only observed in high fields @xcite .",
    "to get an instructive insight , we would like to compare the alternating nnn interaction in our model with the alternating nn interaction in the well - known spin - peierls ( sp ) model . in the language of field theory",

    "the lowest energy configuration is @xmath66 if @xmath67 or @xmath68 if @xmath69 .",
    "since the most relevant term is @xmath70 , the corresponding sine - gordon system has a pair of soliton and antisoliton solutions ( excitations with @xmath71 ) as well as two breather solutions ( excitations with @xmath72).@xcite the lowest breather is precisely degenerate with the soliton and antisoliton excitations , and they form a bound state which corresponds to @xmath73 triplet . in this case , the elementary excitation should be a spin triplet and a spin singlet , no spinons exist as elementary excitation.@xcite however , the alternating nnn interaction , @xmath74 , does not lift the degenerate phases @xmath58 , due to the existence of the pre - factor @xmath75 .",

    "the intra - layer exchange interactions @xmath204 and @xmath205 on top and bottom layers may have different strengths .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model is given by @xmath206 where the superscripts @xmath207 denote labels of the top and bottom layers .",
    "@xmath202 is the perpendicular inter - layer exchange interaction and @xmath203 is the diagonal inter - layer exchange interaction . here",
    "all the exchanges are taken to be positive .",
    "a similar model has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the layer model is a direct generalization of the bose - gayren ladder model@xcite .",
    "it is clear that every slice of the double layer net is just a ladder whose hamiltonian has the same form of eq .",
    "( [ saw - mg ] ) .",
    "thus we find that the ground state of the layer model is given by a product of all perpendicular singlet pairs @xmath208 when the condition @xmath209 is fulfilled .",
    "a rigorous proof can be made directly by representing the layer model as a sum of the projection operators as in the spin ladder case .",
    "the corresponding ground state energy is @xmath210    = 5.cm    it is obvious that the dimer product state @xmath211 remains the ground state for @xmath212 .",
    "the properties of the ground state are independent of the specific values of @xmath204 and @xmath205 as long as the constraint condition ( [ constraint ] ) is satisfied .",
    "since the dimerized ground state is not degenerate , the lowest excitation is expected to be a triplet excitation , corresponding to breaking of a singlet bond , with a gap size proportional to @xmath213 .",
    "however , the many - particle excitation spectra might be very complicated because of the effective interactions among the triplet excitations@xcite .",
    "the spin - isotropic , asymmetric zig - zag ladders are studied using the field theory method and the variational approach . when the leg exchange integrals are small compared with the nn exchange , the spin model is mapped to a revised double frequency sine - gorden model .",
    "renormalization group analysis shows that there are two fixed points , say , an intermediate - coupling fixed point and a strong coupling fixed point . in the weak frustration limit",
    ", the system is described by the intermediate - coupling fixed point with gapless excitations .",
    "the vanishing of spin velocity at the intermediate - coupling fixed point is likely to indicate a decoupling of spins at low energy scales .",
    "apart from the isotropic separatrix , we find gapless spin liquid and gapped nel states with easy - plane and easy - axis anisotropy . for large frustration , a more usual dimer solid phase is realized corresponding to the strong coupling fixed point .",
    "the rg analysis also predicts that the spin gap is decreased by increasing the leg - asymmetry @xmath3 . a continuous manifold of hamiltonians with the same singlet",
    "product ground state interpolates between the majumdar - ghosh model and the sawtooth spin chain .",
    "starting from the exact ground state wavefunction , we construct the variational wavefunction of the excited state and investigate the change of spin gap with the change of leg - asymmetry @xmath3 . in the spirit of constructing hamiltonian in the form of a sum of positive semidefinite projection operators , extension to the double layer model is carried out .",
    "we propose an exactly solved two - dimensional double layer model with a ground state of a product of inter - layer dimers .",
