    "<S> states well understood using the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the lack of symmetry - breaking in insulators with topological order , including the integer quantum hall states , is now understood to arise from the presence of non - trivial topological components and to lead to gapless boundary modes with chirality . in the so - called z2 2d and 3d systems , these topologically protected metallic states carry extreme interest due to their potential for realizing new technologies in spintronics and quantum computation . combined with symmetry - breaking ordered states </S>",
    "<S> , ti states can give rise to unusual collective modes , such as majorana fermions @xcite with superconductivity and axions @xcite with magnetic order occurring in the topologically non - trivial materials . </S>",
    "<S> besides the exotic collective modes , antiferromagnetism breaks time reversal and translational symmetries but preserves the combination of both symmetries , leading to a different type of ti , the antiferromagnetic ti @xcite . despite extensive studies on bismuth - based ti materials @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> only a few materials have been identified that may harbor an interplay of symmetry - breaking and topological phases @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the large family of ternary half heusler compounds @xcite is a prime candidate for combining topological and symmetry - breaking phases to explore new collective behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these compounds straddle the border between topologically trivial and non - trivial electronic structure due to a strong tuning of the @xmath6- and @xmath7-like band inversion via atomic number , lattice density and spin - orbit coupling strength @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the stabilization of magnetic and superconducting ground states in these materials allows for a controlled interplay of symmetry and topology to be put to use . </S>",

    "<S> 4d ) .    because non - centrosymmetry requires a mixing of singlet and triplet paring states @xcite , the absence of a jump in @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> may actually be considered evidence for the presence of a dominant triplet component , in analogy with the tiny heat capacity jump measured in the a@xmath41 phase of @xmath42he @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is corroborated by the behavior of the upper critical field 2 , which suggests an unusual superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> we plot 2 for ypdbi , lupdbi , and dypdbi obtained from resistive transitions as a function of @xmath43 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b . </S>",
    "<S> 2 increases linearly with decreasing temperature down to @xmath44 , in contrast with @xmath45 in conventional type ii superconductors determined by orbital depairing as described by the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg theory , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is 0.69 in the dirty limit and 0.74 in the clean limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath48 values of 2.7 t ( @xmath49 ) , 2.9 t ( @xmath50 ) , and 0.52 t ( @xmath51 ) for y , lu , and dy , respectively , all exceed the conventional orbital limit , which can occur for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> multiband effects and fermi surface topology @xcite can give rise to an exceedingly large orbital depairing field , but this is not supported by the calculated @xcite and observed @xcite simple band structures . as previously shown for yptbi @xcite , the observed 2 curve is close in form to that of a polar @xmath7-wave ( triplet ) state @xcite as plotted in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c . </S>",
    "<S> together with the superconductivity in the clean limit @xmath52 obtained from experimental parameters , @xmath53 nm and @xmath54 nm , the quasilinear 2 is suggestive of the finite triplet contribution to the pairing state due to the non - centrosymmetric nature . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath48 is comparable to the pauli paramagnetic limiting field @xmath55 ( tesla ) = 1.84@xmath29 ( k ) obtained from a simple estimation within the weak - coupling bcs theory with @xmath56 .    as shown in the phase diagram ( fig .  5 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of magnetism and superconductivity as a function of local moment exchange strength reveals a well - behaved trade - off and coexistence from one ground state to the other . </S>",
    "<S> we plot and as a function of the de gennes factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the land factor and @xmath19 is the total angular momentum of the @xmath18 ion hund s rule ground state </S>",
    "<S> . scales well with @xmath3 for rpdbi , which indicates the coupling between the conduction electrons and the local magnetic moments giving rise to the long range magnetic order is due to the rkky interaction . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , is suppressed almost linearly with @xmath3 , which indicates that magnetic rare earth @xmath18 ions are a source of magnetic pair breaking @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity found in has several peculiar features which may give rise to novel phenomena involving topological surface states or excitations . </S>",
    "<S> first , these superconductors derive from a band structure with extremely low carrier density of @xmath59 @xmath25 , rivaled only by srtio@xmath60 @xcite and fese @xcite . in the superconducting state </S>",
    "<S> , this together with a very light effective mass of 0.09@xmath61 @xcite leads to an extreme long penetration depth @xmath62 1 @xmath63 m ; this situation can give rise to anomalous vortex states and also proximity effect to the topological surface states if present . </S>",
    "<S> more fundamentally , the low carrier density translates to a very small fermi energy ( on the order of several hundred kelvin ) , putting the usual frohlich approximation ( @xmath64 ) , and thus expected bcs superconducting properties , into question . </S>",
    "<S> this breakdown of the frohlich approximation may explain the anomalous estimate of @xmath65 210 k , obtained from experimental parameters , @xmath66 nm and @xmath67 m / s .    </S>",
    "<S> second , non - centrosymmetry of the half - heusler crystal structure forces an automatic mixing of singlet and triplet pairing states in the superconductivity , resulting in not only complex superconducting gap functions , but also very unique excitations involved in the majorana fermions in topological superconductors by controlling the singlet and triplet contributions . indeed , in the non - centrosymmetric superconductor li@xmath68(pt , pd)@xmath69b , by changing the relative concentrations of pt and pd , one can tune the spin parity of the gap function from singlet domiant to triplet dominant @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> third , the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in this system not only adds another of only a few canonical magnetic superconductor platforms such as the borocarbide @xcite and chevrel phase @xcite , but may also serve as a unique platform to investigate topological orders with multi - symmetry breaking states .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the tunability of the band structure via chemical means provides an ideal platform for traversing the quantum phase transition between trivial and non - trivial topological states , traversing the critical lattice parameter and tuning the interplay between antiferromagnetic and superconducting ground states continuously and controllably . </S>",
    "<S> our transport measurements are quite consistent with band calculations , which reveal that is a promising candidate for a topological semimetal </S>",
    "<S> . photoemission studies of the related compound @xmath0ptbi ( @xmath0 = lu , dy , and gd ) have observed metallic surface states not inconsistent with ti properties predicted by band calculations @xcite .    in summary , we have investigated the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in the single - crystal series . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic rare earth members of this series exhibit an antiferromagnetic ordered state with @xmath70 due to rkky interaction between conduction electrons and localized moments . except for gdpdbi , </S>",
    "<S> all members exhibit bulk superconductivity with an unusual upper critical field behavior that suggests odd parity superconductivity , likely due to the lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of both magnetic order and superconductivity with de gennes factor indicates to be a new family of magnetic superconductors , which together with the proposed topological properties provide a unique platform to investigate the emergence of novel quantum states of matter . </S>"
