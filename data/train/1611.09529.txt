    "first - principles ( at the dft level ) and parametrized tb approaches @xcite were employed to investigate the opto - electro - mechanical graphene systems schematized in fig.1.a where a linearly polarized light with energy @xmath0 and polarization angle @xmath1 is considered and an in - plane uniaxial strain of magnitude @xmath2 is applied in the direction @xmath3 with respect to the armchair direction of graphene lattice .    in figs.1.b - c ,",
    "the optical conductivity components are computed as a function of light energy in monolayer graphene without and with strain . as seen ,",
    "our parametrized tb calculations reproduce very well the dft results at low and high energies .",
    "a slight discrepancy between two methods occurs only in the medium energy range where the conductivity peaks are present . in spite of this fact , the two methods are still in very good agreement for the investigation of the overall spectrum of optical conductivities in both unstrained and strained graphene systems ( see the further demonstration in the supplemental material @xcite ) .",
    "very remarkably , the optical hall conductivity is found to be zero for unstrained graphene but exhibits finite values when strain is applied .",
    "this is accompanied by a peak splitting in the longitudinal optical conductivity spectrum .    in order to understand the origins of the optical hall effect observed , the effects of strain on the optical conductivities",
    "are investigated in more detail in fig.2 .",
    "note that in the graphene bandstructure , there are six dirac cones at the corners ( @xmath4-points ) of its brillouin zone , however , they are characterized by only two distinguishable ones . accordingly , six saddle ( @xmath5- ) points occur in the middle of these dirac cones and only three are distinguishable . in the unstrained case ,",
    "these saddle points are degenerate but can be separated in the energy when strain is applied ( see the energy color map in fig.2.a ) . because the optical transitions of charges around the @xmath6-point is low ( see in figs.2.b - c and the related discussions below ) , the optical spectra of graphene can be basically understood by analyzing the transitions around @xmath4- and @xmath5- points . indeed , the optical transitions around the @xmath4-points with a linear energy dispersion result in an almost flat spectrum of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath7 with a universal value of @xmath8 at low energies for monolayer graphene @xcite ( see fig.2.d ) .",
    "at moderately high energies when the transitions around the @xmath5-points take place , this conductivity exhibits a relatively high peak , which is essentially due to high optical transitions and high density of states of graphene at these points .",
    "when strain is applied , two main features occur .",
    "first , strain effects make graphene lattice very anisotropic , leading to a strong anisotropy of the absorption spectrum , i.e. , the conductivity @xmath7 is strongly dependent on the light polarization and strain direction ( see the further details in @xcite ) .",
    "second , as already mentioned , the strain can break the degeneracy of saddle points , leading to the separation of the peaks of @xmath7 as presented in fig.1.c and figs.2.d .",
    "now , the ohe in strained graphene is explored , i.e. , a finite strain - induced conductivity @xmath9 as displayed in fig.1.c and fig.2.e .",
    "one of the key terms to determine the conductivity @xmath10 from the kubo formula ( see the details in @xcite ) , and hence understand the underlying mechanism if this ohe , is the optical transition functions @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 are eigenstates in the valence / conduction bands , respectively , and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the velocity operators .",
    "different from @xmath15 that is a non - negative function ( see fig.2.b ) , @xmath16 is either positive or negative when considering the whole brillouin zone of graphene ( see in fig.2.c ) .",
    "the hall conductivity can be hence rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the absolute values of terms corresponding to positive and negative @xmath16 , respectively . in unstrained case ,",
    "@xmath19 and hence the conductivity @xmath9 is totally zero for any polarization and energy of light . in strained graphene ,",
    "the equality of @xmath18 is broken by strain , leading to a finite @xmath9 .",
    "physically , it can be understood that in analogy to the magnetic - field effects that break the time - reversal symmetry , the lattice symmetry breaking by strain changes the optical responses and hence results in the ohe in graphene .    for all cases presented in fig.2.e , two interesting properties of @xmath9 are found .",
    "first , similarly to the conductivity @xmath7 , the hall conductivity @xmath9 exhibits an almost flat spectrum in the low energy regime and tends to zero at very high energies .",
    "second , high peaks of @xmath9 are also observed , especially , at the same energies as for the @xmath7-component ( see fig.1.c and figs.2.d - e ) .",
    "however , while @xmath7 is always positive , the full spectrum of @xmath9 presents both positive and negative peaks and accordingly , two ( low and high ) energy regimes where this hall conductivity has opposite signs .",
    "this novel property can be understood as follows .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath16 can be either positive or negative in specific areas of the brillouin zone of graphene .",
    "simultaneously , when strain is applied , the graphene bandstructure is deformed , leading to the separation of degenerate bands in such different areas . because of these two features , two terms @xmath18 are alternatively dominant in different energy regimes , leading to opposite hall conductivities at low and high energies as observed .",
    "additionally , this hall conductivity is also predicted to be strongly anisotropic ( see the detailed discussions below ) , similar to the @xmath7 component @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "the possibilities of achieving and tuning a large hall conductivity are investigated .",
    "first , the hall conductivity obtained for different uniaxial strains is displayed in fig.3.a .",
    "the light polarization @xmath20 is chosen so as to achieve the largest @xmath9 for strains applied along the direction @xmath21 ( see fig.4 below ) . at low energies , the hall conductivity is gradually increased when increasing the strain magnitude and , particularly , reaches @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ev . at high energies ,",
    "@xmath9-peaks occur and are very rapidly increased for low strains , i.e. , they reach values larger than @xmath25 for a small strain of only @xmath26 , and progressively saturate at large strains .",
    "basically , the high peaks of @xmath9 @xmath27 @xmath25 can be achieved for a strain of only a few percents . in order to further enlarge @xmath9 ( e.g. , to achieve large faraday / kerr rotations ) , another strategy is suggested @xcite , i.e. , to use few - layer graphene systems .",
    "indeed , as presented in fig.3.b , the hall conductivity is almost linearly increased as a function of number of graphene layers @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , extremely large peaks of @xmath9 , @xmath2913@xmath25 at @xmath30 ev and @xmath29 - 10@xmath25 at @xmath31 ev , and a large value @xmath295@xmath25 at 2 ev are achieved for a uniaxial strain of 8@xmath32 and @xmath33 .    the effect of shear strains is also investigated in fig.3.c .",
    "interestingly , a smaller shear strain than uniaxial one is required in order to achieve a similarly large @xmath9 .",
    "our calculations show that overall , the amplitude of hall conductivity is proportional to the off - diagonal term @xmath34 of the strain tensor @xcite . in the oxy axis chosen as in fig.1.a , @xmath35 and @xmath36 for uniaxial and shear strains , respectively , with the poisson ratio @xmath37 @xcite . on this basis ,",
    "the largest @xmath9 is respectively proportional to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. , with two strains satisfying @xmath40 the similar @xmath9-magnitude can be achieved .    achieving both positive and negative values of",
    "the hall conductivity is a very novel/ promising result for practical applications ( see the discussions below ) .",
    "as presented in fig.2 and fig.3 , the sign of @xmath9 can be reversed by tuning the light energy . in fig.3.a , another possibility of reversing this conductivity is also found , i.e. , by switching from positive to negative strain .    as already shown in fig.2 , the hall conductivity induced by strain is predicted to be strongly anisotropic , i.e. , strongly dependent on the light polarization and strain direction . in fig.4 ,",
    "colormaps showing the full dependence of @xmath9 on the directions of light polarization and strain are presented . for a given strain ( see figs.4.a - c and 4.g - h ) , the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath9 generally satisfies the simple rule @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a function of @xmath43 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . at low energies",
    ", @xmath42 is approximately zero for all strain directions . for a given light polarization ( see figs.4.d - h ) , the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath9 also satisfies the same rule at low energies but due to the presence of @xmath9-peaks , becomes more complex at high energies . additionally , the peaks of @xmath9 in ( @xmath44)-maps presents three specific peanut lines with the symmetry under a rotation of 60@xmath45 ( see in figs.4.d - f ) .",
    "the full spectrum of @xmath9 generally presents three peaks but only two peaks are observed if the light polarization or strain direction is parallel to the armchair or zigzag directions of graphene ( see fig.2 , figs.4.a , 4.c , 4.d , and 4.f ) .",
    "actually , when uniaxial strain is applied , there are two symmetry directions of lattice deformation , i.e. , either parallel or perpendicular to the strain direction .",
    "the most common property observed here is that @xmath9 is generally high if @xmath46 and low if the light polarization is parallel to any symmetry direction of lattice deformation mentioned above , i.e. , @xmath47 as seen in figs.4.g - h .",
    "therefore , the overall dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath1 and @xmath3 generally satisfies the rule @xmath48 although it is considerably disturbed by the presence of @xmath9-peaks at high energies ( see fig.4.h ) . for shear strains ,",
    "this rule becomes @xmath49 as discussed above for fig.3.c .",
    "most interestingly , the direction dependence explored here suggests other possibilities of controlling the sign of @xmath9 , i.e. , by changing the light polarization and strain direction .    finally , it is worth noting that in analogy to the effect of an external magnetic field , the present opto - electro - mechanical effect is essentially due to the lattice symmetry breaking and hence completely general , i.e. , it can be observed in many other 2d materials even though they are metallic , semimetallic or semiconducting . as some examples , ab initio optical hall conductivities calculated in silicene , borophene , and phosphorene are presented in fig.5 , which demonstrates that the mechanism explored in this study is indeed very general .",
    "note however , that the optical hall conductivity remains zero until the optical gap is reached .",
    "for instance , while borophene is a metal , optical transitions occur only for energies above 23 ev ( depending on the applied strain)@xcite . for phosphorene ,",
    "the energy threshold for transitions is @xmath291 ev at the level of dft but the optical gap can be modified because of screening and exitonic effects .",
    "finally , due to its similar bandstructure at low energies , there is no gap for the optical hall conductivity in silicene ( see the inset of fig.5 ) , but its value is much smaller than that obtained in graphene .",
    "the latter might be explained by a lower fermi velocity in silicene compared to graphene as the optical transitions are proportional to the expectation value of velocity operators @xcite .",
    "now , let us discuss novel properties of this strain - induced ohe and related possible applications .",
    "first , a finite @xmath9 can be achieved under zero magnetic field .",
    "second , different from the longitudinal component , the sign of this conductivity can be reversed by tuning the light energy and polarization , changing the strain type ( i.e. , from positive to negative ) and its direction .",
    "note that the dependence on light polarization can not be observed for @xmath9 induced by an external magnetic field where it is totally isotropic @xcite .",
    "these switching possibilities can be exploited to explore novel applications in opto - electro - mechanical devices .",
    "third , extremely large @xmath9 can be observed when shining on the system by a light beam with appropriate energy and can be further enlarged using few - layer systems , of course , at the expense of higher transmittance loss .",
    "this is an important ingredient for designing efficient faraday rotators and related applications .",
    "interestingly , with the binary property of @xmath9 when varying the ligh energy and its polarization , the designed faraday rotator can work as an optical polarizer with a specific output polarization that is dependent on and can be controlled by tuning the strain direction .",
    "indeed , fig.6 illustrates this feature in the case of strain angle @xmath50 .",
    "the linearly polarized light carries an electric field oscillating along a given axis determined by the angle @xmath1 ( see in fig.1 and the red line in fig.6.a ) . in the low energy regime and for the chosen angle @xmath1 as in the fig.6.a , the corresponding value of the hall conductivity is positive ( see inset ) and therefore the light rotates in the clockwise direction ( orange arrow ) towards the axis determined by the strain direction ( green axis ) . when its polarization is aligned with the strain direction",
    ", @xmath9 is zero and hence the light does not rotate anymore .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the dependence of @xmath9 ( i.e. , both intensity and sign ) on the light polarization @xmath1 as presented in figs.4.a - c and more clearly in fig.4.g , all the light beams in the low energy regime are always rotated towards the strain axis either with a clockwise or anti - clockwise rotation .",
    "note that by symmetry , the two directions @xmath1 and @xmath51 are equivalent .",
    "the direction orthogonal to the strain ( dark orange axis ) presents also @xmath52 but corresponds to a saddle point since for any small deviation , the light rotates away from this point .",
    "such a device can thus be used as an efficient light polarizer in the sense that it does not only filter polarized light but also convert light that is not correctly oriented into the desired orientation determined by the direction of applied strain .    additionally , if one now considers linearly polarized light with several frequencies , it is possible to separate the spectrum into two parts .",
    "as discussed above , the low energy components of the incoming light rotate towards the strain axis . in the high energy regime",
    "the optical hall conductivity has a opposite sign , compared to that obtained at low energies .",
    "therefore , as illustrated in fig.6.b , the high energy components rotate towards the axis orthogonal to the strain direction .",
    "thus , the incoming light can be separated into two beams having orthogonal polarizations with the energy threshold ( @xmath29 3 - 4 ev depending on the applied strain ) , which is the energy point where the sign of @xmath53 is reversed .    with these properties discussed above",
    ", the system can also act as a converter of circularly polarized light into a linearly polarized light .",
    "actually , a circularly polarized light can be considered as a combination of two orthogonal and dephased linearly polarized lights . since these two linearly polarized lights can be subjected to opposite faraday rotations , the transmitted light becomes linearly polarized along to the strain ( resp .",
    "its orthogonal ) axis in the case of low ( resp .",
    "high ) energies , respectively , with an amplified electric field ( see the detailed illustration in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that since the transmittance is extremely high in the considered thin 2d systems @xcite , the intensity of transmitted light maintains high values compared to the incoming one , which is different from 3d systems where a large part of light can be reflected or absorbed .    to conclude",
    ", strain engineering has been demonstrated to be a novel and alternative approach to efficiently generate optical hall effect in graphene and 2d materials .",
    "compared to the conventional effect observed under an external magnetic field , the strain - induced optical hall conductivity exhibits rich properties , i.e. , its value can be modulated whereas its sign can be reversed by tuning incident light ( frequency and polarization ) and/or strain ( magnitude and direction ) .",
    "the observed properties could be exploited to explore novel optical devices and , particularly , specific applications in opto - electro - mechanical 2d systems .",
    "* first - principles calculations*. first - principles calculations were performed using the self - consistent density functional theory ( dft ) within the gga - pbe approach implemented in the siesta @xcite package .",
    "the complex optical conductivity tensor @xmath10 is derived from the complex dielectric tensor @xmath54 using the formula @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the vacuum dielectric constant .",
    "note that the calculation of @xmath54 requires a specific treatment because of the 2d nature of the system .",
    "further details can be found in the supplementary materials @xcite .",
    "* tight - binding calculations*. the tight binding ( tb ) calculations for graphene were performed within a third - nearest - neighbors orthogonal model that has been demonstrated to give reasonably accurate results , compared to the dft ones @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the parameters ( i.e. , onsite energy and three hopping terms ) of this tb model were elaborated from the dft data so as to achieve the best agreement between the two methods in the calculation of the electronic bandstructure and the optical conductivities .",
    "the tb optical conductivities are computed using the standard kubo formula @xcite . when strain is applied , the graphene lattice is deformed and the @xmath57 bond length is hence modified .",
    "taking into account this effect , the tb hopping energies are modified following the exponential decay law as in @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of this calculation method can be also found in the supplementary materials @xcite .",
