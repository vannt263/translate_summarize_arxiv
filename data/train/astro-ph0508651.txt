    "much has been published on binary statistics and much of this has been concerned with the statistics of spectroscopic binaries ( sbs ) ( e.g. goldberg , mazeh & latham 2003 ; halbwachs et al . 2003 ; boffin , cerf & paulus 1993 ; boffin , paulus & cerf 1992 ) . among the statistics discussed",
    "three of the most important have been the distributions of period ( @xmath2 ) , primary mass ( @xmath3 ) and mass - ratio ( @xmath7 , where the primary in this paper is always taken to be the more massive star ) .",
    "these three parameters in particular are important as they present a set of variables that suffice to describe the principal properties of a binary system and its evolutionary path .",
    "many papers have also been published specifically just on the mass - ratio distributions of sbs ( e.g. hogeveen 1991 ; trimble 1974 , 1978 , 1987 , 1990 ) .",
    "the question of whether there is a peak in the @xmath5 distribution near @xmath8 has been a matter of debate for some time , on which we hope to shed some light in this paper .",
    "for instance the recent paper of goldberg et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a distinct bimodal distribution ; however , unlike ours , their sample was not confined to a particular volume and so might be expected to exhibit biases related to this fact .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) of binaries is also of interest and , together with the period distribution , is important for the validation of star formation models .",
    "the imf and @xmath2 distributions are also important for understanding the chemical evolution of the galaxy : interacting binary systems have more complex evolutionary pathways by which material can be lost to the interstellar medium ( ism ) than single stars , leading , for example , to important systematic corrections to predictions of the carbon yield ( tout et al .",
    "binary - system population synthesis models may then give a more complete idea of the enrichment of chemical elements in the ism .",
    "this kind of modelling has been done before for single stars but to date studies of this kind for double stars have had to make certain assumptions about the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 distributions and the imf .",
    "there have also been studies of stars within galactic clusters ( e.g. khler 1999 ) which are thus magnitude - limited and occupy specific limited volumes , as is the case for our sample , but which constitute very specific subsets of stars all of a particular age .",
    "cluster stars are also in the process of diffusing from the cluster at a significant rate over time - scales of the order of @xmath9 yrs . hence the statistics of cluster binaries , while interesting in their own right , are not necessarily representative of binaries in general , or field binaries in particular and we do not consider them further .    what has not been done before to our knowledge is a study of the statistics of a distance and luminosity - limited sample of field binaries that is , as far as is possible with existing data , evolutionarily unbiased and complete .    in this paper",
    "we derive the distributions for the period @xmath2 , primary mass @xmath3 , mass ratio @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the mass of the secondary so that @xmath12 ) and the imf for a distance and luminosity - limited sample of sbs in the local solar neighbourhood @xmath13pc and @xmath1 and from there are able to make some deductions about these same distributions for the general population of field binaries . because our sample is luminosity - limited",
    ", the only systems we will be missing completely will be those with primary mass @xmath14 on the main sequence .",
    "this luminosity cut - off makes the sample as unbiased as possible in an evolutionary sense .    while the sample is certainly _ not _ complete to the distance and luminosity limits stated , we believe that it is as complete as it is possible to make it without seriously compromising the sample size , and so without also compromising the conclusions drawn from the study . although the sample is far from complete in absolute terms , we are able to make an assessment of the incompletenesses and are thus able to attempt to compensate for them .",
    "we thus believe that our sample is the best approximation to a volume - limited sample possible with the data currently available ( to be truly volume - limited the sample would have to include _ all _ objects to the specified distance and luminosity limits ) .",
    "the spectroscopic binary data for the study was taken from the eighth catalogue of orbital elements of spectroscopic binary systems ( batten , fletcher & maccarthy 1989 ) , hereafter referred to in this paper as the ` batten ' catalogue , supplemented by other data of r.f .",
    "griffin , both published ( see the synopsis paper griffin 2000 and others of that series ) and unpublished ( private communication ) , hereafter referred to as ` rfg ' data .",
    "the batten catalogue was until recently the most comprehensive catalogue of sbs available , its selection criterion simply being to include all sb data available at the time of compilation .",
    "it thus encompasses a very diverse range of motivations for observation from all the many contributors , and so will contain a variety of selection effects , which are largely unknown apart from the tendency mentioned below to favour shorter - period systems .",
    "the inclusion of the rfg data was designed firstly to increase the size of the available dataset ( many more objects having been observed since publication of the batten catalogue in 1989 , many of them by roger griffin ) , and secondly to attempt to compensate for the inevitable bias of the batten catalogue towards shorter - period systems ( inevitable because of the difficulties involved in sustaining consistent observing programmes for longer - period systems , as roger griffin has been able to do ) .",
    "the batten catalogue consists of 1469 sbs and the rfg data of 498 sbs .",
    "the combined batten and rfg dataset ( after removing duplicated objects ) was filtered to a distance of 100pc and limiting absolute magnitude of 4 ( @xmath13pc and @xmath1 ) by correlating entries with the _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "the correlation was done by henry draper catalogue ( hd ) number , or by coordinates ( corrected for precession ) if no hd number existed , using the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes and apparent magnitudes to calculate distances and absolute magnitudes .",
    "the cutoff for absolute magnitude was chosen in such a way that the sample should ( to that magnitude ) be as complete and homogeneous as possible , while at the same time having a sufficient number of systems to derive reasonable statistics .",
    "the chosen limiting absolute magnitude of 4.0 translates to an apparent magnitude of 7.5 at 50pc and to 9.0 at 100pc .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue is complete to @xmath15 , and in some areas down to @xmath16 ( perryman et  al .",
    "1997 ; schrder & pagel 2003 ) , so all the sbs in our initial dataset of 1803 distinct stars that are closer than 50pc ( more precisely 46pc ) and brighter than @xmath17 should have been identified via the comparison with _ hipparcos _ , and a reasonable fraction of those closer than 100pc should also have been identified .",
    "a fainter limit would have created an inconsistent sample that , while having data from more systems at close distances , would be missing a lot of fainter systems at greater distances ; it is already clear from the number in our final sample that many of the systems in the sb catalogues lie beyond 100 pc .",
    "the fainter limit would have led to a much steeper fall - off of completeness with distance than we find in our chosen sample , creating a sample that was harder to analyse . as mentioned above , because our sample is luminosity - limited with an absolute magnitude limit of ( @xmath1 ) , the only systems we will be missing completely will be those with primary mass @xmath18 on the main sequence .    when filtered in this way ,",
    "the sample consists of 371 sbs : 145 double - lined sbs ( sb2s ) and 226 single - lined sbs ( sb1s ) .",
    "it is this sample that we work with in the analysis that follows in the rest of the paper .",
    "the period distribution was found directly from the spectroscopic binary data . for later use in evolutionary studies",
    "the periods were divided into the four categories given in table  [ table : period / evol - cats ] .",
    "it is intended that the four period categories should correspond roughly to the following four evolutionary scenarios :    1 .",
    "@xmath19 d.  systems that will interact , if at all , at a late stage in their evolution , with the primary well on its way up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "2 .   500 d @xmath20 10 d.  systems that interact as the primary evolves onto the red giant branch ( rgb ) or the agb .",
    "10 d @xmath20 1 d.  systems that interact on the early rgb or as the primary leaves the main - sequence and enters the ` hertzsprung gap ' .",
    "4 .   @xmath21 d.  systems that interact while on the late main sequence or earlier ( contact systems ) .",
    ".period / evolutionary categories .",
    "the numbers of sbs are for @xmath13pc and @xmath1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : selection_effects ]    table  [ table : selection_effects ] summarizes the following argument . the variation with @xmath22 shows fractions with decreasing average mass and decreasing average _ apparent _ brightness as the absolute magnitude limit becomes fainter , while the variation with volume shows fractions which again have decreasing apparent brightness as the volume is increased but now have the _ same _ average mass for all volumes .",
    "the variation with volume shows a decrease in fraction by a factor of @xmath23 from 25 to 100pc , while the variation with limiting @xmath22 shows a decrease by a factor of @xmath24 over a corresponding range of @xmath25 to 4 ( a factor of 4 in distance being equivalent to a difference of 3 in magnitude ) .",
    "the decrease with limiting @xmath22 could again be due to a shallower pdmf or a selection effect , but the decrease with volume could only be due to the increasing incompleteness as the volume enlarges ( and apparent brightness decreases ) .",
    "the fact that the two fractions fall off by approximately the same factor shows that the decrease with @xmath22 , and hence the shallower pdmf , is indeed due to a selection effect .",
    "the true pdmf and imf of the binary primaries are therefore nearly identical to those of single field stars in the solar neighbourhood ( schrder & pagel 2003 and references contained therein ) .",
    "we wish to express our special gratitude to r.f .",
    "griffin for the generous use of his unpublished sb data which constitutes a significant fraction of the total sample studied .",
    "we also thank the _ centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg _ ( cds ) for their excellent internet database through which access was gained to the _ hipparcos _ and batten catalogues , and also the referee , chris tout , and colleagues at the astronomy centre at the university of sussex , who gave much valuable advice on improving the paper .",
