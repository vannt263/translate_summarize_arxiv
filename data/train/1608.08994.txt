    "the greatest scientific challenge in the history of civilization is known to be set forth with ancient belief in the five _ basic _ elements : earth , water , air , fire , and aether [ see , e.g. , the yoonir in fig . 1 ] . early credence in these basic elements",
    "dates back to pre - socratic times and persisted throughout the middle ages and into the renaissance , deeply influencing european thought and culture .",
    "these five elements are also sometimes associated with the five platonic solids .",
    "many philosophies have a set of five elements believed to reflect the simplest essential principles upon which the constitution of everything is based .",
    "most frequently , five elements refer to the ancient concepts which some science writers compare to the present - day states of matter , relating earth to solid , water to liquid , air to gas , and fire to _ plasma_. historians trace the evolution of modern theory of chemical elements , as well as chemical compounds , to medieval and greek models . according to hinduism",
    ", the five elements are found in _ vedas _ , especially _ ayurveda _ ; are associated with the five senses : ( i ) hearing , ( ii ) touch , ( iii ) sight , ( iv ) taste , and ( v ) smell ; and act as the gross medium for the experience of sensations .",
    "they further suggest that all of creation , including the human body , is made up of these five elements and that , upon death , the human body dissolves into these five elements , thereby balancing the divine cycle of nature .",

    "a state of matter whose size and/or shape is beyond imagination .",
    "a plasma is , by definition , an ionized gas in which the length which separates the single - particle behavior from the collective behavior is smaller than the characteristic lengths of interest .",
    "researchers in plasma physics have come to the recognition that @xmath0 of the mass of the universe exists in the form of plasma .",
    "the term plasma refers to the _ blood _ of the universe .",
    "plasma is invisible ; pervades all space in gigantic streams ; powers everything : every galaxy , every star ; formed by the nature of its dynamics ; and its organization in space is shaped by the electromagnetic force of the universe .",
    "the same force also pinches the streams ever tighter , until the concentration becomes so great that _ explosive _ node - points result where plasma dissipates .",
    "our sun is known to be located at the center of one of the node points [ see fig . 2 ] . physically , plasma is loosely defined as globally neutral medium made up of unbound electrically charged particles . the term unbound , by no means , refers to the particles being free from experiencing forces .",
    "when the charges move , they generate electric currents which create magnetic fields which , in turn , act upon the currents and , as a result , they are affected by each other s fields .",
    "much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of controlled nuclear fusion and fusion power , for which plasma physics provides the scientific basis . as to the interpretation of ( space ) plasma dynamics , the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) that provides theoretical framework has always stood to the test .    , width=302,height=302 ]",

    "pinch effect is the manifestation of self - constriction of plasma caused by the action of a magnetic field that is generated by the parallel electric currents_. the result of this manifestation is that the plasma is heated as well as confined .",
    "the phenomenon is also referred to as bennett pinch , electromagnetic pinch , plasma pinch , magnetic pinch , or ( most commonly ) the pinch effect .",
    "pinch effect takes place naturally in electrical discharges such as lightning bolts [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "3 ] , the auroras , current sheets , and solar flares .",
    "pinches may become unstable .",
    "they radiate energy as light across the whole electromagnetic spectrum including x - rays , radio waves , gamma rays , synchrotron radiation , and visible light .",
    "they also produce neutrons , as a result of fusion ",
    "although a desired nuclear fusion has never been achieved because the confinement and the instability are two concurrent and diametric events . as to the applications ,",
    "pinches are used to generate x - rays and the intense magnetic fields generated are used in forming of the metals [ see , e.g. , fig . 4 ] .",
    "they also have applications in astrophysical studies , space propulsion , and particle beam weapons .",
    "numerous large pinch machines have been built in order to study the fusion power . clearly , a cylindrical geometry is pertinent to the effect .",
    "[ courtesy of the wikipedia].,width=302,height=302 ]    the magnetic self - constriction ( or self - attraction ) of the parallel electric currents is the best - known and the simplest example of ampre s force law , which states that the force per unit length between two straight , parallel , conducting wires is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the magnetic force constant from the biot - savart law , @xmath4 is the total force on either wire per unit length ( of the shorter ) , @xmath5 is the distance between the two wires , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the direct currents carried by the wires .",
    "this is a good approximation if one wire is sufficiently longer than the other that it can be approximated as infinitely long , and if the distance between the wires is small compared to their lengths ( so that the one infinite - wire approximation holds ) , but large compared to their diameters ( so that they may also be approximated as infinitely thin lines ) .",
    "the value of @xmath3 depends upon the system of units chosen and decides how large the unit of current will be . in the si system , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 n / a@xmath10 ; whereas in the cgs system , @xmath11 . for the modest current levels of a few amperes , this force is usually negligible , but when current levels approach a million amperes , such as in electrochemistry , this force can be significant since the pressure is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "the form of ampre s force law commonly given was derived by maxwell and is one of the several expressions consistent with the original experiments of ampre and gauss .",
    "note in passing that the ampre s law underlies the definition of the ampere , the si unit of current .",
    ".,width=226,height=302 ]    let us scrutinize how and why the pinch effect comes into being .",
    "for this purpose , we consider a cylindrical coordinate frame with the axis z along the axis of the wire .",
    "for the moment , we do not even need to know its size such as the radius .",
    "we assume that the electrons ( of charge -@xmath13 , with @xmath14 ) flow in the positive direction of the z axis with a velocity @xmath15 .",
    "for the symmetry reasons , we restrict the magnetic field to be azimuthal , i.e. , to have only component @xmath16 . in order to evaluate @xmath17",
    ", we use ampere s law in the integral form for the circular path as depicted in fig .",
    "the result is that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 , i.e. , it is oriented clockwise with respect to the z axis .",
    "the magnetic force @xmath21 is in the radial direction guided towards the axis .",
    "the dependence on @xmath22 implies that the force is independent of the sign of the charge . clearly then , the magnetic force tends to push the electrons towards the axis of the wire . in other words , in a flowing current beam the self - generated magnetic field always acts to _ pinch _ the beam  or to let it shrink around the axis .",
    "next , the lorentz force @xmath23 yields @xmath24 for @xmath25 to be zero",
    ". this yields @xmath26 . from the integral form of the gauss theorem",
    ", we find that this field is generated by a charge density @xmath27 , which is uniform over the wire such that @xmath28 , which gives @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 holds , we obtain @xmath31 $ ] ; @xmath32 being the ion density .",
    "the electron density is uniform , but it exceeds the value @xmath33 that would ensure @xmath34 .",
    "this leads us to infer that there has been some accumulation of electrons inside the wire , rising the density by a factor @xmath35 . for an electron in an ohmic conductor",
    "usually @xmath36 cm / sec , thus @xmath37 implying that the pinch effect is too small to be observed .",
    "the effect can be robust in high density particle beam or plasma columns where @xmath38 is non - negligible .",
    "a real deal given the appropriate plasma medium where @xmath39 is not much less than one.,width=302,height=188 ]    characteristically , the pinch effect can be understood most easily through the example of a current flowing along the axis of a cylinder filled with a conducting medium .",
    "the lines of force of the magnetic field @xmath40 generated by the current have the form of the concentric circles whose planes are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder . the electrodynamic force per unit volume of a conducting medium with a current density @xmath41",
    "is @xmath42(@xmath43 ) ; this force is guided towards the axis of the cylinder and tends to squeeze down the medium .",
    "the state that arises is the pinch effect .",
    "the pinch effect may also be considered a simple consequence of amp  ere s law [ see above ] , which describes the magnetic attraction between the individual parallel current filaments whose aggregate is the current cylinder .",
    "notice that the magnetic pressure ( @xmath44 ) is impeded by the kinetic pressure ( @xmath45 )  directed from the axis  of the medium arising from the thermal motion of the medium s particles . when the current is sufficiently large such that the _ plasma _ @xmath46 [ @xmath47 @xmath48 , the pinch effect comes into being .",
    "the pinch effect requires that the population of the charge carriers of opposite signs in the medium be nearly equal . in a medium of charge carriers of single sign",
    ", the electric field of the space charge effectively impedes the inward action of the magnetic pressure .",
    "it is obvious by now that the pinch effect is paramount in the problems of controlled thermonuclear fusion . as to the geometries",
    "[ see appendix a ] , the term @xmath49-pinch has come into wide usage to denote an important confinement scheme which relies on the repulsion of oppositely directed currents and which is thus not in accord with the original definition of the pinch effect ",
    "self - attraction of the parallel currents . as such",
    ", the z - pinch remains by far the most preferred scheme for the plasma confinement [ see fig .",
    "( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this amplifies the magnetic field and accelerates the pinch , heating the plasma and causing it to radiate x - rays ( red).,width=302,height=188 ]    in order to take this brief history of the pinch effect to the point where it was formally discussed first , we would like to recall the mechanism behind the bennett pinch in the gaseous plasmas .",
    "incidentally , the bennett pinch is also known by other names such as equilibrium or steady - state pinch because in the bennett pinch no variable is a function of time . as stated above ,",
    "while the magnetic pressure tends to confine the plasma , the kinetic pressure tends to oppose it . when these forces are balanced , an equilibrium is attained .",
    "the resulting state is what we call the bennett pinch .",

    "the equilibrium z - pinch can be described by the balance of kinetic pressure at the axis and magnetic pressure at the surface ( @xmath58 ) : @xmath59 the magnetic field at the cylindrical surface is calculated from the total current by using the ampre s law to write @xmath60 these two equations allow us to determine the relationship between the pinch radius , the temperature at the axis , and the total current : @xmath61 this is known as the bennett - relation after willard h. bennett who first discussed this z - pinch effect in 1934 .",
    "equation ( 4 ) estimates the total current that must be discharged through the plasma medium in order to confine the plasma at a specified temperature for a given linear particle density and the pinch radius @xmath62 .",

    "the pinch effect is one of the most fascinating phenomena in plasma physics with immense applications to the problems of peace and war .",

    "they argued that the magnetic forces due to the large current flow could have caused the compression and distortion .",
    "shortly thereafter , northrupp published a similar but independent diagnosis of the phenomenon in liquid metals [ 2 ] .",
    "however , the major breakthrough in the topic came with the publication of the derivation of the radial pressure balance in a static z - pinch by bennett [ 3 ] .",

    "the issues related to confinement , as discussed above , are not encountered . however , since no system provides an ideal environment in the real world , the ssps also pose challenges . in a conventional ssp with no impurities ,",
    "the thermally excited pair density is a function of temperature only .",
    "any deviation from this ( thermal ) equilibrium can ( and , generally , does ) give rise to recombination , which , in turn , affects the pinching process .",
    "the desired maintenance of the equilibrium pair density occurs through various processes such as coulomb interactions and particle - lattice interactions , which are not independent and hence cause unintended consequences .",
    "the quantum wires  just as other low - dimensional structures such as quantum wells and quantum dots  are the systems in which most of the experiments are performed at low ( close to zero ) temperatures .",
    "therefore , the risks of thermal non - equilibrium and recombination are much smaller than those ordinarily encountered in conventional ssp .",
    "this implies that two - component quantum wires at low temperatures offer an ideal platform for the realization of the quantum pinch effects .    )",
    "direction [ red arrow ] and the toroidal ( @xmath80 ) direction [ blue arrow ] .",
    "notably absent is the radial coordinate which starts from the center of the tube and points out .",
    "nothing is perfect : this torus breaks the @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "[ after dave burke ( 2006)].,width=359,height=264 ]    myriad of applications of quantum pinches bud out from the very thought of the self - focused , two - component plasma in a quantum wire with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the plasma by definition is electrically conductive implying that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields .",
    "the self - focusing ( or pinching ) only adds to the response .",
    "the quantum wire brings all this to the nanoscale .",
    "therefore , we are designing an electronic device that can ( and will ) control the particle beams at the nanoscale .",
    "potential applications include extremely refined nanoswitches , nanoantennas , optical amplifiers , and precise particle - beam nanoweapons , just to name a few .",
    "the greatest advantage of the quantum pinch effect over its classical counterpart is that it offers a gaussian - like cycle of operation with two minima passing through a maximum .",
    "the smooth functionality of the plasma devices is , however , based on a single tenet : there must be means not only to produce it , but also to sustain it .    according to one retelling , prometheus  the ( mythological ) greek god  gave mankind not just the fire but the very arts of civilization itself - from writing to medicine to astronomy .",
    "fusion is the promethean fire that has lit the heavens for billions of years .",
    "it is the ultimate clean , renewable energy resource , burning seawater as fuel , and producing no carbon dioxide , smoke , or radioactive waste .",
    "what it does produce is a prodigious and inexhaustible source of energy - in principle , a teaspoon of hydrogen can generate as much energy as 10 metric tons of coal .",
    "it powers the sun ; it powers the stars ; it powers the galaxy",
    ". why can we not make it power the earth as well ?",
    "the author feels grateful to loren n. pfeiffer who affirmed the feasibility of achieving the aspect ratio of @xmath151 in the semiconducting quantum wires within the current technology and for the fruitful discussions .",
    "he would also like to express his sincere thanks to alex maradudin , allan macdonald , bahram djafari , h. sakaki , bob camley , jun kono , naomi halas , peter nordlander , and chizuko dutta for useful communications and stimulating discussions on various aspects related to the subject .",
    "he is appreciative of kevin singh for the invaluable help with the software during the course of this investigation .",
    "finally , he should like to thank dr .",
    "phua , editor - in - chief , for the invitation to contribute to this subject , which is still in its infancy , and for his great patience .",
    "one dimensional geometry is generally a cylindrical tube which is symmetrical in the axial ( @xmath66 ) direction as well as in the azimuthal ( @xmath49 ) direction .",
    "three pinch geometries generally studied in one dimension are : the @xmath49-pinch , the z - pinch , and the screw pinch .",
    "the one - dimensional pinches are known after the direction in which the current flows .",
    "note that we assume the physical geometry to be made up of non - magnetic materials , which implies @xmath158 in the maxwell equations . also , we restrict ourselves to the situation shielded by @xmath159 , i.e. , where we discard the displacement current in the fourth maxwell equation .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field @xmath40 is only the function of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath49-pinch has a magnetic field oriented in the z direction [ i.e. , @xmath161 . then employing ampere s law yields @xmath162 knowing that @xmath40 is only a function of @xmath5 , this simplifies to @xmath163 so , @xmath41 points in the @xmath49 direction .",
    "thus , the equilibrium condition [ @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) ] reads : @xmath166 symbol @xmath57 refers to the kinetic pressure of the plasma .",
    "notice that the @xmath49-pinch tends to resist the plasma instabilities .",
    "this is due in part to the alfvn s theorem ( or frozen - in - flux theorem ) [ see appendix b ] .",
    "the @xmath167-pinch has a magnetic field oriented in the @xmath49 direction [ i.e. , @xmath168 .",
    "again , employing ampere s law yields @xmath169 since @xmath40 is only a function of @xmath5 , this reduces to @xmath170 so , @xmath41 points in the z direction .",
    "thus , the equilibrium condition [ @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) ] reads : @xmath171 since particles in the plasma basically follow the magnetic field lines , the z - pinch leads them around in circles .",
    "therefore , the z - pinch offers excellent confinement characteristics [ see fig .",
    "14 ] .      in the screw pinch",
    ", the magnetic field has a @xmath49 component as well as a z component [ i.e. , @xmath160 ] .",
    "the screw pinch is explicitly an effort to merge the stability aspects of the @xmath49-pinch and the confinement aspects of the z - pinch .",
    "referring once again to ampere s law @xmath173 so , this time , @xmath41 has a component in the z direction and a component in the @xmath49 direction .",
    "thus , the equilibrium condition [ @xmath164(@xmath165 ) ] reads : @xmath174 it is noteworthy that with the neglect of the displacement current in the fourth maxwell equation , it is quite appropriate to ignore coulomb s law as well .",
    "this is because the electric field is completely determined by the curl equations and ohm s law [ @xmath175 . if the displacement current is retained and @xmath176 is taken into account , corrections of only the order of @xmath39 result . for the normal mhd problems these are completely negligible .",
    "that is to say that the whole analysis in this appendix lies within the legitimate realm of mhd .",
    "a common problem with one - dimensional pinches is the end losses .",
    "most of the motion of particles is along the magnetic field . with the @xmath49-pinch and the screw - pinch",
    ", this leads particles out of the end of the machine very quickly , resulting in a loss of mass and energy .",
    "besides , the z - pinch has severe instability problems . though particles can be reflected to some extent with magnetic mirrors , even these allow considerable number of them to still pass through .",
    "a common remedy of controlling these end losses is to bend the cylinder around into a torus [ see fig .",
    "15 ] . unfortunately",
    ", this breaks @xmath49 symmetry , as paths on the inner portion of the torus are shorter than the those on the outer portion .",
    "thus a new theoretical framework is needed .",
    "this gives rise to the famous grad - shafranov equation numerical solutions of which have yielded some equilibria , most notably that of the reversed pinch .",
    "for the plasma assumed to be a perfect conductor [ with the conductivity @xmath177 , the ohm s law renders : @xmath178 this is sometimes referred to as the flux freezing equation .",
    "the nomenclature comes about because eq .",
    "( b1 ) implies that the magnetic flux through any closed contour in the plasma , each elemnt of which moves with the local velocity , is a conserved quantity . in order to verify this assertion ,",
    "let us consider the magnetic flux @xmath179 , through a contour @xmath180 , which is co - moving with the plasma : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is some surface which spans @xmath183 .",
    "the time rate of change of @xmath179 is made up of two parts .",
    "first , there is the part due to the time variation of @xmath40 over the surface @xmath182 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath184 using the third curl maxwell equation , this becomes @xmath185 second , there is the part due to the motion of @xmath183 .",
    "if @xmath186 is an element of @xmath183 , then @xmath187 is the area swept out by @xmath186 per unit time .",
    "hence the flux crossing this area is @xmath188(@xmath189 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath190 using stokes theorem , this becomes @xmath191 hence , the total time rate of change of @xmath179 is given by , from eqs .",
    "( b4 ) and ( b6 ) , @xmath192\\cdot d{\\bf s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given the condition in eq .",
    "( b1 ) , eq .",
    "( b7 ) is led to conclude that @xmath193 in other words , @xmath179 remains constant in time for an arbitrary contour .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the magnetic field - lines must move with the plasma .",
    "that is to say that the filed - lines are frozen into the plasma .",
    "since the magnetic filed - lines can be regarded as infinitely thin flux - tubes , we conclude that mhd plasma motion also maintains the integrity of field - lines .",
    "that means magnetic field - lines embedded in an mhd plasma can never break and reconnect : i.e. , mhd forbids any change in the topology of the field - lines .",
    "it turns out that this is an extremely restrictive constraint .",
