    "the muon - spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) technique is one of the most powerful and unique tool to study the internal magnetic field distribution @xmath7 associated with the vortex lattice in type - ii superconductors ( see , e.g. refs . ) . in the vortex state for an applied magnetic field @xmath8 , or @xmath9 ( @xmath5 and @xmath10 are the first critical field and the magnetic induction in a sample , respectively ) @xcite the energy of the surface , separating normal and superconducting fractions of the sample becomes negative and the field penetrates the sample in the form of quantized flux lines , called vortices each of them containing an elementary flux quantum ( @xmath11  wb ) @xcite . in the case of small pinning these vortices arrange themselves in a regular vortex lattice called a flux - line lattice ( fll ) @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the internal magnetic fields @xmath7 inside the superconducting sample in the vortex state is uniquely determined by two characteristic lengths , the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath1 and the coherence length @xmath2 . from @xmath0sr experiments",
    "@xmath7 profiles are obtained by performing a fourier transformation of the @xmath0sr time spectra .",
    "there are different approaches to analyze @xmath0sr data .",
    "generally , the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath1 is determined from the second moment @xmath12 of the internal field distribution @xmath7 @xcite . for an isotropic extreme type - ii superconductor ( @xmath13 )",
    "it was shown that @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the more advanced approaches that allow to obtain not only @xmath1 , but also the coherence length @xmath2 , require a theoretical model for the spatial variation of the internal magnetic field @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is spatial coordinate ) .",
    "an essential requirement of the model is that it must account for the finite size of the vortex cores .",
    "so far , the internal magnetic field distribution @xmath7 measured by @xmath0sr was analyzed assuming analytical models for @xmath15 based on london and ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theories .",
    "the london theory provides the simplest approach to model the fll .",
    "since london theory does not account for the finite size of the vortex cores , a cutoff factor derived from gl theory must be inserted into the analytical london expression for @xmath15 to correct for the divergence of @xmath15 in the vortex core @xcite .",
    "the gl theory has the spatial dependence of the order parameter build in and thus provides a phenomenological description of the magnetic field profile in the vortex core region .",
    "abrikosov @xcite predicted the vortex core state from a periodic solution of the gl equations near the second critical field @xmath17 and provided an approximate analytical solution of these equations for an isolated vortex for fields of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "clem @xcite proposed a variational method to solve the gl equations that was further extended by hao _",
    "a simplified version of this model for @xmath18 was developed by yaouanc _",
    "@xcite , and is often used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the london and the gl models were widely applied to determine values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from measured @xmath0sr time spectra taken in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that despite of the broad usage , the limits of validity of these models and the reliability of the parameters extracted from the fits are not much discussed in the literature .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to address these basic questions .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts . in the first part",
    "we briefly describe the models often used for the analysis of @xmath0sr spectra : the london model with gaussian cutoff ( lg model ) , the modified london model ( ml model ) , and the analytical ginzburg - landau model ( agl model ) .",
    "these models are compared with the most precise model based on the iterative method for solving the ginzburg - landau equations developed recently by brandt @xcite , the so called numerical ginzburg - landau model ( ngl model ) .",
    "@xmath7 profiles for various sets of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and magnetic field @xmath10 were first simulated by means of the ngl model and then analyzed within the framework of the lg , ml , and agl model .",
    "for further discussions , it is convenient to define the reduced magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "it was found that the ml model can be used _ only _ for low magnetic fields ( @xmath20 ) , while both the agl and the lg model yield reliable results almost in the _ whole _ magnetic field range . however , the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained by means of the agl and the lg model deviate systematically from the initial parameters used for the simulated @xmath7 profiles for magnetic fields in the range @xmath21 .",
    "it was also shown that for @xmath22 the @xmath7 profiles do not depend on the coherence length @xmath2 . in the second part of the paper we present a systematic analysis of simulated @xmath0sr time spectra ( with typical statistics used in real @xmath0sr experiments ) by means of the lg model . in the whole field range ( @xmath23 ) and for any values of the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath24 there is a strong correlation between the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 determined from the fit .",
    "this implies that an analysis of @xmath0sr data using this approach , without taking into account these correlations , may lead to substantial errors in the determination of the absolute values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and even may result in unphysical dependencies of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on magnetic field and temperature .",
    "in addition , the second moment method applied to a multiple gaussian fit was tested in order to check how reliably the penetration depth @xmath1 can be determined by this method . in particular , the influence of the number of gaussians used in the multi - gaussian fit on the quality of the fit was investigated . for typical statistics used in the experiment and practically in the whole field range ( @xmath25 ) , the second moment method applied to a multi - gaussian fit may provide correct values for @xmath1 within a few percent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii various theoretical models used to analyze @xmath0sr data are briefly described .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic field distribution @xmath7 on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath26 , and the gaussian smearing parameter @xmath27 , as calculated within the lg model , is discussed in sec .",

    "ii in order to search for possible correlations between the parameters , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the conclusions follow in sec .  vi .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the simplest and the most widely used approach for analyzing @xmath0sr data is based on the relation between the magnetic penetration depth @xmath1 and the second moment @xmath12 of the internal field distribution @xmath29 of the ideal fll @xcite : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the proportionality coefficient depending on the value of the reduced magnetic field @xmath32 [ @xmath33 is the first moment of @xmath29 ] and the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath35 @xcite . in order to estimate @xmath12 one often assumes that @xmath29 is a sum of @xmath36 gaussian distributions ( generally , @xmath37 ) @xcite : @xmath38 } , \\label{eq : p(b)gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the weight factor , the first moment , and the standard deviation of the @xmath42th gaussian component , respectively .",

    "the london models ( with different cut off factors ) provide the simplest and fastest way to calculate @xmath29 for the analysis of @xmath0sr data for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "better approximations of @xmath29 for small values of @xmath35 and fields closer to @xmath47 can be obtained by the agl model @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , ginzburg - landau theory is only valid in the neighborhood of the phase boundary @xmath48 of a type - ii superconductor .",
    "however , it is generally assumed , that ginzburg - landau models are also good approximations for any field and temperature .",
    "the results obtained by the ngl model correspond to the minimum of the ginzburg - landau free energy , whereas other models described in this paper are just approximations to the ngl model .",
    "therefore , the ngl model will be used as a reference for comparison with the agl , ml , and lg models . a relatively simple method to calculate @xmath29 within the framework of the ngl model",

    "it is discussed under what conditions these models can be used to describe the vortex state in extreme type - ii superconductors . as a result , the ml model can be applied for fields @xmath270 ( @xmath47 is second critical field ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the agl and the lg model can be applied in the whole range of fields , but in the range @xmath271 they systematically deviate from the ngl model .",
    "it was shown that at low fields @xmath272 there is practically no dependence of the line shape on @xmath2 . however , with increasing field , there is a strong dependence of the line shape on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but the strong correlation between them makes it almost impossible to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 simultaneously .",
    "this is independent of @xmath3 and the model used .",
    "additional restrictions for @xmath2 ( or @xmath1 ) are needed to get rid of this correlation for reasonable statistics .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that it is possible to determine @xmath1 and @xmath27 simultaneously , provided that @xmath2 is fixed and the correlation between them is not too strong .",
    "in addition , it was demonstrated that the second moment method ( sm ) , frequently used for @xmath0sr data analysis , may yield reliable values for @xmath1 ( within a few percent ) in whole field range @xmath25 , provided that vortex lattice disorder is not substantial .",
    "a multiple gaussian fit may give reliable values for the second moment and may well approximate the local magnetic field distribution in a type - ii superconductor . in order to substantiate these conclusions made above",
    ", we performed virtual experiments by generating noisy @xmath0sr spectra with known parameters .",
    "the results of a comprehensive analysis of these @xmath0sr spectra are in full agreement with the conclusions made above .",
