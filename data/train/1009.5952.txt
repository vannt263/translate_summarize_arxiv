    "static ( dc ) and dynamic ( ac ) electric dipole polarizabilities determine the response of neutral particles to applied electric fields .",

    ". therefore , they are inappropriate for high - precision experiments where the polarizabilities of _ excited _ states are relevant .    as part of an ongoing investigation of parity violation in atomic ytterbium ( yb )  @xcite , a scheme for measuring a combination of polarizabilities of the ground and an excited state of yb was developed  @xcite .",
    "the scheme involves the simulation and measurement of the spectral lineshape of a forbidden electric dipole transition driven by a standing wave of light in the presence of a dc electric field . due to the standing wave ,",
    "the ac stark shifts of the upper and lower states introduce a polarizability - dependent distortion in the lineshape , a phenomenon which was first observed and characterized during a search for apv in cesium  @xcite .",
    "the difference of polarizabilities of the two states is treated as a variable parameter in the simulation and is measured by fitting the simulated lineshape to experimental data .",

    "the lsm is sensitive to the _ difference _ of polarizabilities of the atom in its ground and excited states .",

    ", we present a versatile method for measuring the excited - state polarizabilities of atoms .",
    "we demonstrate the lsm using the 408-nm transition in atomic yb .",
    "whereas the previous results  @xcite were obtained in the absence of a magnetic field , the present work uses a magnetic field to isolate zeeman sublevels of the excited state .",
    "the ac stark shifts of the sublevels are characterized by different combinations of scalar , vector , and tensor polarizabilities .",
    "this approach allows for the unambiguous determination of these polarizabilities .",
