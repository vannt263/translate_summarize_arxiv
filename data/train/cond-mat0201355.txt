    "the physics of high - mobility two - dimensional electron systems in strong perpendicular magnetic fields continues to produce surprises .",
    "electronic states with strong correlations in this regime originate fundamentally from the macroscopic degeneracies , landau levels , in the spectrum of the free - particle kinetic energy hamiltonian",
    ". when spin , layer , or other degrees of freedom are important at low energies , correlations at integer filling factors can give rise to broken symmetry ground states  @xcite with interesting physical properties .",
    "bilayer quantum hall systems , whose ground states can have spontaneous interlayer phase coherence , provide the simplest and best characterized example of this tendency , and have been studied both theoretically and experimentally for more than ten years .  @xcite the superfluid effects associated with spontaneous coherence are especially dramatic .  @xcite most work on these states has concentrated on the case of total lowest landau level ( lll ) filling factor @xmath2 equal to one .",
    "the quantum hall effect , indicative of a gap for charged excitations , is observed in this system at sufficently small interlayer separations @xmath3 .",
    "the charge gap in this case must result entirely from interlayer correlations ,  @xcite since individual layer states at filling factor @xmath4 are compressible .",
    "as the layer separation or the electron density in each layer is decreased there is a phase transition , likely of first order in the absence of disorder , from a compressible state with no quantum hall effect to a highly correlated incompressible state  @xcite with spontaneous coherence . in this paper",
    "we present a new approach which can be used to study the properties of these interesting ordered states and how they vary with layer separation .",
    "the layer degree of freedom in the quantum hall bilayer can be conveniently described using a pseudospin language : pseudospin up corresponds to an electron in the top layer and pseudospin down to an electron in the bottom layer .",
    "@xcite the interlayer phase coherent quantum hall state corresponds in this language to a pseudospin ferromagnet with an @xmath5 easy - plane .",
    "our work is motivated by two limitations that apply to most theoretical work on bilayer quantum hall ferromagnets .",
    "the usual assumption in most previous studies of @xmath0 bilayers has been that the spin degree of freedom can be ignored , _",
    "i.e. _ that spin dynamics are frozen out by the magnetic field . at finite temperatures , however , this assumption is usually not justified : the typical value of the zeeman gap is only @xmath6 1k , which is often smaller than the pseudospin gap when the interlayer phase is fixed by finite tunneling .",
    "there is a broad range of nonzero temperatures for many samples in which there is a nontrivial interplay between spin and pseudospin fluctuations .",
    "a second set of limitations that applies to much theoretical work on quantum hall bilayers follows from the use of a gradient expansion in deriving an effective continuum pseudospin model .",
    "it is sometimes bothersome in applying this approach that divergent coefficients , due to the long - range of the coulomb interaction , appear in the energy functional when one goes beyond the gradient expansion s leading order .",
    "a more severe limitation , however , is the fact that this approach can not address the physics that gives rise to the phase transition between ordered and disordered states which , as we explain in some detail , is due to competing interactions on microscopic length scales .",
    "the importance of correlations on microscopic length scales for the phase transition was already evident in early work where it was associated with soft collective excitations@xcite at a finite wavevector .",
    "the precise nature of the compressible state close to the transition is not completely understood at present and we belive that our approach can shed some light on this question .    in this paper we present a careful study of the spin - pseudospin physics of the @xmath0 bilayer in the quantum hall state which is free from these limitations .",
    "our approach is based on a systematic mapping from the microscopic interacting electron problem to a model with su(4 ) generalized spins on a lattice and anisotropic interactions .",
    "su(4 ) group appears here since we take into account both spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom and thus single - electron states are four - component spinors . the _ only _ simplification necessary to derive",
    "this mapping is the assumption of the absence of charge fluctuations , reasonably well justified in the incompressible state . to take advantage of the existence of a charge gap in the quantum hall regime",
    ", we use a complete orthonormal set of magnetic wannier functions on a von neumann lattice as the lll orbital basis .",
    "given this basis , and the neglect of charge fluctuations , we can derive a coupled spin - pseudospin hamiltonian which turns out to be unexpectedly simple . using the spin - hamiltonian",
    "we derive , the full arsenal of analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed to solve spin problems on a lattice can be applied to quantum hall systems . in this paper",
    ", we present a study of this hamiltonian using the schwinger boson mean field theory ,  @xcite developed originally by arovas and auerbach for the su(2 ) invariant heisenberg model , appropriately generalized for the anisotropic case .",
    "we obtain a variety of new results for the temperature dependence of some experimental observables , the spin magnetization and the interlayer differential capacitance in particular .",
    "we note that our approach is valid not only for the @xmath0 case but can be easily generalized to a quantum hall bilayer with any integer filling factor , and with any orbital character of nearby landau levels . for bilayers ,",
    "the case of @xmath1 is also interesting and has been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite since the schwinger boson mean field theory has some limitations , we hope that the present results will motivate the application of more rigorous monte carlo or exact - diagonalization techniques to our model hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] we give a detailed derivation of our spin - pseudospin effective lattice hamiltonian that we obtain by using a functional integral approach . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we discuss the generalization of the schwinger boson mean field theory of arovas and auerbach to the case of spin models with anisotropy . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we apply these considerations to our spin - pseudospin model for bilayer quantum hall systems , discussing the results of our calculations and commenting on their relevance to experiments .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] by briefly discussing the application of our approach to other broken symmetry states at integer filling factors in quantum hall systems , including the case of @xmath1 in bilayers .",
    "a single - particle state of an electron in a qh bilayer is described by three quantum numbers : lll orbital state quantum number @xmath7 , spin @xmath8 and pseudospin @xmath9 . in the incompressible state at filling factor @xmath0",
    "one can assume at low enough temperatures that there are no charge fluctuations and that each lll orbital state @xmath7 is always occupied by exactly one electron .",
    "the model we derive starting from this assumption describes quantum fluctuations of the remaining spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom .",
    "we will allow electrons in each lll orbital to be in the most general coherent superposition of spin and pseudospin eigenstates . to define our notation",
    ", we write the corresponding creation operator as @xmath10 here we have introduced 4-component spinor index @xmath11 to describe the mixed spin - pseudospin degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath12 labels an up - spin electron in the top layer , @xmath13 a down - spin top - layer electron , @xmath14 a bottom - layer up - spin electron , and @xmath15 a bottom - layer down - spin electron .",
    "@xmath16 is the creation operator for an electron in the lll orbital state @xmath7 and with 4-spinor index @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 are complex amplitudes that satisfy the normalization constraint @xmath19 a single slater determinant many - body wavefunction can be constructed by putting exactly one electron with an arbitrary spinor ( [ 1 ] ) ( for @xmath0 ) in every lll orbital state @xmath7 @xmath20 our approach is based on the observation that this set of states is complete when charge fluctuations are neglected .",
    "we assume that the bilayer is described by a hamiltonian of the following form  @xcite @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced @xmath22 pauli matrices @xmath23 corresponding to the usual pauli operators acting on pseudospin degrees of freedom only .",
    "the analogous spin pauli matrices will be denoted @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the 2d coulomb interactions between electrons in the same and different layers respectively .",
    "the single particle part of the hamiltonian , @xmath28 , consists in general of three terms , corresponding to an interlayer bias potential , an interlayer tunneling amplitude , and zeeman coupling to the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath29    since the occupation of each orbital state is fixed at one for @xmath0 in our approach , the orbital , or charge degree of freedom in ( [ 4 ] ) is irrelevant .",
    "we would therefore like to completely eliminate any reference to the charge degree of freedom present in the microscopic hamiltonian , obtaining an effective hamiltonian that refers only to spin and pseudospin variables . the most convenient and mathematically rigorous way to do this",
    "is provided by a functional integral approach .",
    "assuming at each discrete imaginary time that the single slater determinant states are complete , and following standard lines for the derivation of path integral formulations of quantum statistical mechanics problems , we obtain the following formal expression for the partition function of a @xmath0 quantum hall ferromagnet : @xmath30e^{-s[\\bar z , z]},\\ ] ] where the imaginary time action is given by @xmath31=\\int_0^{\\beta }   d\\tau \\left[\\sum_i(\\langle z_i | \\partial_{\\tau } |z_i \\rangle - \\frac{\\delta_v}{2}\\langle z_i|\\tau^z|z_i\\rangle - \\frac{\\delta_t}{2}\\langle z_i|\\tau^x|z_i\\rangle - \\frac{\\delta_z}{2}\\langle z_i|\\sigma^z|z_i\\rangle)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{ij } ( h_{ij } \\langle z_i |\\tau^z|z_i\\rangle   \\langle z_j |\\tau^z|z_j\\rangle-   f^+_{ij } \\langle z_i|z_j\\rangle \\langle",

    "can be thought of as bosonic coherent state variables and we can introduce bosonic creation operators @xmath34 corresponding to complex variables @xmath18 .",
    "the normalization condition ( [ 2 ] ) translates into the single - occupancy constraint for the @xmath35 bosons @xmath36 the action ( [ 7 ] ) is identical to that which arises from a coherent state path integral representation of the partition function for a system of bosons described by the following hamiltonian @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can think of the bosons we introduce as schwinger bosons representing `` spins '' which are generators of the su(4 ) group ( the usual physical spins are su(2 ) generators ) .",
    "the su(4 ) generators are written in terms of the schwinger boson creation and annihilation operators as follows @xmath38 the hamiltonian ( 9 ) can now be rewritten in terms of the su(4 ) `` spin '' operators @xmath39 @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have thus mapped the original problem of interacting electrons in a quantum hall bilayer onto a generalized `` spin '' problem .",
    "each lll orbital @xmath7 ( `` lattice site '' in the spin model language ) is occupied by an su(4 ) `` spin '' and `` spins '' on different sites are coupled via a long - range anisotropic interaction ( we will rewrite these spin operators below in terms of more physically transparent su(2 ) spin and pseudospin operators ) .",
    "so far we have not specified the lll orbital basis we are using .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of the model that follows from neglecting charge fluctuations does depend on the single - particle representation we employ .",
    "it is obvious that the usually used orbit - center quantum numbers in landau or symmetric gauges are not good choices for the complete set of orbital labels since they are not localized and the energy penalty for double occupation will vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our approach is best used in combination with a wannier - like von neumann lattice basis set for a landau level ,  @xcite in which orbitals are centered on lattice sites and the unit cell area equals the area per flux quantum , @xmath41 , to accomodate exactly one electron with a corresponding su(4 ) `` spin '' per site at @xmath0 .",
    "we choose a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath42 .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that such a basis exists .",
    "a strong magnetic field imposes certain restrictions on the localization properties of magnetic orbitals ,  @xcite and it is well established , for example , that a set of linearly independent _ and _ exponentially localized single - particle orbitals in the lll does not exist .",
    "however , it turns out to be possible  @xcite to construct a complete orthonormal set of wannier - like eigenfunctions , which , although not exponentially localized , have a well defined gaussian core and a power law fall off at large distances . following",
    "@xcite we refer to these orthonormal basis states as magnetic wannier functions .",
    "the procedure one uses to construct such a basis set is very much like the one used to construct the usual wannier functions in a crystal .",
    "one starts from the set of minimum uncertainty wavepackets for electrons in the lll , centered at the sites of the square lattice described above .",
    "the difference from the case of a crystal here is that this set is _ overcomplete _ , as shown by perelomov .",
    "@xcite one then constructs bloch functions from linear combinations of the minimum uncertainty wavepackets and fourier transforms them to obtain the wannier functions .",
    "there are subtleties in this procedure and we refer the reader to the appendix of our paper and to the original papers  @xcite for further details . for the following discussion it is important to note that the procedure used to construct the basis states depends on the size of the system , so that the spin and pseudospin interactions we discuss below have values that depend on the overall system size , converging to well defined values in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the `` spin model '' ( [ 11 ] ) is not very useful as it is because we do not have much intuition about su(4 ) `` spins '' .",
    "however , it turns out to be possible to further rewrite ( [ 11 ] ) in a much more useful form . to proceed one notes that the set of su(4 ) generators ( [ 10 ] ) is not unique .",
    "@xcite we define a different set of generators , more appropriate for our purpose , as follows .",

    "this hamiltonian ( [ 14 ] ) is one of the main results of our paper .",
    "let us emphasize that this hamiltonian is _ exact _ , given the assumed absence of charge fluctuations .",
    "it is written in terms of the usual physical spin-@xmath48 operators and therefore all the great variety of methods available for spin models can be applied to it .",
    "note also the quite unexpected simplicity of ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "all the effects of spin - pseudospin interaction are contained in the two terms with only four spin-@xmath48 operators .",
    "the _ classical _ ground state of ( [ 14 ] ) is one with uniform spin - polarization in the direction of the applied zeeman field and uniform pseudospin that , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , is in an arbitrary direction in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "it is _ identical _ to the hartree - fock ground state of the original microscopic hamiltonian . due to the anisotropic character of ( [ 14 ] )",
    "there will be corrections to the hartree - fock picture even at zero temperature .",
    "these corrections can be expected to be quite strong , since we are dealing with spin-@xmath48 operators , i.e. the system is far away from the semiclassical regime . in fact , as we comment later , corrections to hartree - fock theory grow in importance as the layer separation is increased . although these quantum fluctuations can , and have ,  @xcite been addressed in a fully microscopic model at the generalized - random - phase - approximation ( grpa ) level , the explicit removal of charge degrees of freedom in the approximate hamiltonian we have derived allows a wider variety of more powerful theoretical techniques to be applied . in particular , the grpa corresponds to a linearized spin - wave theory approximation to the above hamiltonian .",
    "later we will go beyond this level approximation , by applying schwinger boson mean field theory to our model hamiltonian .",
    "we now discuss some simple properties that can be used to simplify ( [ 14 ] ) before embarking on a more detailed study .",
    "we note that @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ that on - site direct and exchange coulomb matrix elements are identical .",
    "it follows that the on - site contributions to the hamiltonian add to a constant term that has no effect on spin and pseudospin dynamics , a property we use below .",
    "we also note that in the absence of the single - particle terms , the hamiltonian has the correct @xmath52 symmetry .",
    "correspondingly there are two goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of these symmetries .",
    "their dispersion relations are readily evaluated in the linear spin wave approximation .",
    "for @xmath53 we find that @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ swd ] we show dispersions ( [ 15 ] ) evaluated for a 20@xmath5520 square lattice in the @xmath56 direction using @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "all energies in this paper will be in units of @xmath59 , the characteristic energy scale for all fractional quantum hall systems .",
    "note that in this example , which corresponds to reasonably typical values , the pseudospin gap is appreciably larger than the spin gap , even though the bare values of tunneling and zeeman coupling are the same .",
    "this difference is due to pseudospin fluctuations present in the ground state , even in a linearized spin - wave theory , and originates from the fact that the hamiltonian is invariant under all spin rotations , but only under pseudospin rotations around the @xmath60 axis , the u(1 ) symmetry referred to above .",
    "the dip in the pseudospin wave dispersion at the boundary of the brillouin zone signals the emerging development of antiferromagnetic instability , which eventually destroys the long - range pseudospin ferromagnetic order .",
    "it is this feature of the microscopic physics that is missing in long - wavelength effective models .",
    "let us now briefly consider the simplified hamiltonian in which spins are frozen out ( @xmath61 ) , valid at @xmath62 in the presence of a zeeman field : @xmath63 + \\sum_{ij}\\left[(2h_{ij}-f^s_{ij})t^z_it^z_j- f^d_{ij}{\\bf t}^{\\perp}_i \\cdot { \\bf t}^{\\perp}_j\\right].\\ ] ] consider the evolution of ( [ 16 ] ) as one increases the interlayer separation from 0 . at  @xmath64 , @xmath65 and",
    "the system in the absence of tunneling and bias is an su(2 ) invariant pseudospin ferromagnet . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the @xmath67 term dominates and the bilayer ground state is an easy - plane pseudospin ferromagnet . at a certain critical value of the interlayer separation @xmath68",
    "a quantum phase transition occurs to a state with no long - range easy - plane ferromagnetic order . to understand more deeply why this occurs we plot in fig.[coupling1 ] and [ coupling2 ] the pseudospin couplings @xmath69 and @xmath70 for two different values of the interlayer separation .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , increasing the interlayer separation primarily affects @xmath71 coupling , changing its character from short - range ferromagnetic at @xmath72 to long - range ( @xmath73 ) antiferromagnetic at @xmath58 ( we use the word _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ here just to emphasize the sign change of the interaction , it is not immediately clear that the ground state is actually antiferromagnetic , although it very likely is ) .",
    "the change in @xmath74 is accompanied by a weakening of the in - plane ferromagnetic interaction @xmath75 .",
    "at present , experimental samples have a @xmath76 value that is not very far below the critical value .",
    "we therefore expect that the effective interactions illustrated for the @xmath58 case are representative of the current typical experimental situation .",
    "this change in character reflects a change in the relative importance of exchange interactions within the layers ( @xmath77 ) , which are not @xmath3 dependent and the electrostatic interactions between the dipoles ( @xmath78 ) that are created by @xmath60 direction pseudospin polarization and whose moments are proportional to @xmath3 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "electrostatics dominates , @xmath74 is antiferromagnetic , and competition develops between two qualitatively different potential ground states .",
    "_ our analysis makes it clear that it is this developing competition that is responsible for the phase transition that occurs in bilayer quantum hall systems for @xmath79 . _ in our model which neglects charge fluctuations , the ground state at large @xmath3 is likely an antiferromagnet with ising anisotropy , as it appears from the analysis of the classical energetics of eq.([16 ] ) . in experiment , the loss of the quantum hall effect at this transition indicates that it is accompanied by the loss of a charge gap , making charge fluctuations at least somewhat important .",
    "however , even if we neglect the charge fluctuations , i.e. still assume that the system can be described by the pseudospin model ( [ 16 ] ) in the compressible region , the precise nature of the pseudospin state above the transition is not immediately obvious , although as we have pointed out above , it is likely to be antiferromagnetic .",
    "the @xmath80 term generally favors an easy axis antiferromagnetic ordering of pseudospins .",
    "however , the long - range character of the @xmath80 coupling ( since it orginates from coulomb interactions between dipoles associated with @xmath60-direction pseudospin polarization , one can expect it to fall off as @xmath81 ) could introduce frustration and a nontrivial spin liquid state .",
    "a recent quantum monte carlo study  @xcite of a quantum xxz model with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions , which is similar to ( [ 16 ] ) , has shown that both neel and striped phases are possible , depending on the relative strength of the interactions .",
    "our model could in principle produce more exotic phases due to the truly long - range character of spin - spin interactions in our case .",
    "the phase transition between the xy - ferromagnetic and neel or striped phases in  @xcite was shown to be first order , which gives additional support to the validity of our model , since according to recent exact diagonalization studies ,  @xcite the compressible - incompressible transition in @xmath0 bilayers is very likely of first order as well .",
    "we believe that the pseudospin hamiltonian ( [ 16 ] ) captures important parts of the physics of this still poorly understood quantum phase transition and deserves further study .",
    "although we concentrate in this paper on the case of bilayer quantum hall systems at @xmath0 in the lowest landau level , the same formalism can be used to derive spin - pseudospin models for other cases of interest .",
    "for example , pseudospin stripe states  @xcite are expected at @xmath0 in the case of landau levels with orbital index @xmath82 , and ising ferromagnets are expected  @xcite in bilayers when the orbital indices in the two layers differ . in our formalism these different phases will appear naturally because of changes in the effective pseudospin - pseudospin interactions .",
    "the effective interactions we calculate depend slightly on the finite size of the system in which the magnetic wannier states are orthogonalized , but approach a definite value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "effective interactions for either the thermodynamic limit , or for any specified finite size system , are available from the authors on request for any of the above cases .",
    "to investigate finite - temperature properties of our spin - pseudospin model for lowest landau level bilayers , one needs to go beyond linear spin wave theory ( [ 15 ] ) which is not adequate in two space dimensions ( 2d ) at any finite temperature due to the absence of long - range order .",
    "a simple but powerful method , the schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) , was proposed by arovas and auerbach .",
    "@xcite it does not break spin rotational invariance at finite temperatures , yet correctly reproduces linearized spin wave theory in the semiclassical limit . for the su(2 ) heisenberg model sbmft qualitatively reproduces the low temperature continuum field theory results .",
    "@xcite for 1d integer antiferromagnetic spin chains , sbmft gives the correct value of the haldane gap in the ground state .",
    "however , it fails in the case of the half - integer chains , where berry phase effects missed by sbmft result in a gapless excitation spectrum at zero temperature .    in the next section",
    "we briefly recount some features of the original theory , developed for the su(2 ) invariant heisenberg model , that will be important for our discussion .",
    "we then show how to achieve a proper generalization of sbmft for spin models with anisotropy , a procedure that requires some care .",
    "we then apply our generalized sbmft to the model hamiltonian derived in the present section .",
    "we first briefly review the original sbmft proposed by arovas and auerbach  @xcite for the su(2 ) invariant spin model .",
    "our motivation here is to lay the ground work for the generalization to anisotropic interaction models that is required for the application to our model hamiltonian . consider the 2d heisenberg model on a square lattice with only nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath83 the sum is over neighboring _",

    "nonzero expectation values for these bond operators represent _ short - range order_. there are of course many possible bond operators one can define , however _ only the su(2 ) invariant ones are relevant _ , since rotational invariance is preserved in the spin liquid state .",

    "one can write the spin hamiltonian ( [ 17 ] ) in terms of these bond operators as follows @xmath93 from ( [ 21 ] ) the physical meaning of the two bond operators is clear .",
    "nonzero expectation value of @xmath90 represents short - range ferromagnetic order , of @xmath91short - range antiferromagnetic order . using ( [ 20 ] )",

    "we are , however , only interested in the saddle point , or mean field , solution itself and therefore will use a more simple - minded approach .",

    "the first of equations ( [ 30 ] ) is the constraint on the _ average _ number of schwinger bosons per site , while the second is the self - consistent expression for the bond operator expectation value .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath105 is now clear .",
    "the second term in ( [ 29 ] ) is just the gapless magnon dispersion with a self - consistently renormalized stiffness constant .",
    "the gap @xmath104 reflects the finite correlation length in the spin liquid at finite temperatures .",
    "as the temperature goes to zero and the system size @xmath96 goes to infinity , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and the gapless quadratic spin wave dispersion is recovered .",
    "note however , that the mean field quasiparticles in sbmft are _ not _ magnons . due to the fact that the constraint on the total number of schwinger bosons on each site is enforced in ( [ 30 ] ) only on average ,",
    "unphysical excitations which change the local number of schwinger bosons are allowed in the mean field theory .",
    "it is straightforward to show that at finite temperatures sbmft reproduces the _ renormalized classical _  @xcite correlation length for 2d quantum ferromagnets and antiferromagnets . for 1d integer antiferromagnetic chains at @xmath62 ,",
    "the haldane gap is also correcty described .",
    "generally , sbmft has proven to be a very successful and useful tool .",

    "<S> we present a new theoretical approach to the study of @xmath0 quantum hall bilayer that is based on a systematic mapping of the microscopic hamiltonian to an anisotropic su(4 ) spin model on a lattice . to study the properties of this model we generalize the heisenberg model schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) of arovas and auerbach to spin models with anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the temperature dependence of experimentally observable quantities , including the spin magnetization , and the differential interlayer capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> our theory represents a substantial improvement over the conventional hartree - fock picture which neglects quantum and thermal fluctuations , and has advantages over long - wavelength effective models that fail to capture important microscopic physics at all realistic layer separations . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism we develop can be generalized to treat quantum hall bilayers at filling factor @xmath1 . </S>"
