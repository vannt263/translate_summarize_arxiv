    "dissipationless simulations run in the concordance cosmology make robust predictions for the structure of cold dark matter haloes ( e.g. , navarro 1997 , 2010 ; bullock 2001 ; diemand 2007 ; macci 2007 ; stadel 2009 ; zhao 2009 ; klypin 2011 ; dutton & macci 2014 ) .",
    "one of these predictions is that cdm haloes should have `` cuspy '' central density profiles that scale as @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "observations have yet to unambiguously find these cusps .",
    "furthermore , a variety of studies based on gas dynamics , stellar dynamics and gravitational lensing on scales from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters often favor cored ( @xmath8 ) or shallow cusps ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) instead ( e.g. , de blok 2001 ; swaters 2003 ; sand 2004 ; goerdt 2006 ; kuzio de naray 2008 ; walker & pearrubia 2011 ; oh 2011 ; newman 2011 ; 2013 ) .    this lack of observational evidence for cuspy dark matter density profiles is often used as evidence against the cdm paradigm . however , a major complication in the comparison between observations of dark matter density profiles and those predicted by cosmological n - body simulations is the uncertain impact of baryons .",
    "baryonic processes can both increase and decrease the density profiles of dark matter haloes .",
    "this currently prevents the observed structure of dark matter haloes from being used as a robust test of the cold dark matter model . a fully predictive theory for the structure of cdm haloes must take into account the effects of galaxy formation .",
    "if the accretion of baryons onto the central galaxy is smooth and slow then dark matter haloes should contract adiabatically ( blumenthal 1986 ) .",
    "this process can increase the density of dark matter haloes by an order of magnitude .",
    "other processes can cause the dark matter halo to expand , such as transfer of energy / angular momentum from baryons to the dark matter via dynamical friction due to minor mergers ( el - zant 2001 , 2004 ; nipoti 2004 ; jardel & sellwood 2009 ; johansson 2009 ; lackner & ostriker 2010 ; cole 2011 ; laporte & white 2015 ) , or galactic bars ( weinberg & katz 2002 ; sellwood ( 2008 ) , but see mcmillan & dehnen 2005 ) , and rapid mass loss / time variability of the potential due to supernovae ( sn ) / stellar / active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback ( navarro 1996 ; read & gilmore 2005 ; mashchenko 2006 , 2008 ; peirani 2008 ; governato 2010 ; pontzen & governato 2012 ; macci 2012 ; martizzi 2012 , 2013 ) . each of these processes is likely to occur during galaxy formation , but at present it is not clear which process ( if any ) dominates , and on which galaxy mass scales .    turning the problem around , if one can observationally measure the halo response , then in the context of @xmath10 , this gives clues to the dominant galaxy formation mechanisms .",
    "in particular , as we discuss in this paper , the halo response may provide a test for different galaxy quenching models . while it is known that most of the stars in massive galaxies formed at high redshifts @xmath11 ( e.g. , thomas 2005 ) , the mechanism(s ) responsible for shutting down star formation ( quenching ) , and keeping it off ( quiescence ) are a subject of much debate .",
    "a popular idea is that feedback of energy from the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) ejects cold gas from galaxies and heats the halo gas , preventing it from cooling onto the central galaxy .",
    "we refer to this class of models as `` agn quenching '' .",
    "it is clear there is enough energy released from the agn to quench star formation , of issue is whether the energy released by the agn can couple efficiently to the surrounding gas ( e.g. , cielo 2014 ) .",
    "an alternative idea is that cooling becomes very inefficient , and effectively shuts down , once the halo mass reaches a critical mass of @xmath12 .",
    "we refer to this class of models as `` halo quenching '' . in practice",
    "the boundary between these two quenching mechanisms is blurry because agn can also act as a heat source for the halo gas , although there are non - agn heating sources such as young and old stellar populations ( kannan 2014 , 2015 ; conroy 2015 ) .",
    "the key difference in these mechanisms is that agn quenching involves the episodic ( and possibly violent ) removal of gas from the galaxy center , whereas halo quenching involves the suppression of gas cooling from the halo .",
    "galaxy formation models implementing both mechanisms can broadly reproduce the colors and mass functions of present day galaxies ( e.g. , croton 2006 ; cattaneo 2006 ; schaye 2015 ) .",
    "however , there is at present no clear way to observationally distinguish between these models .",
    "the correlation between smbh mass and galaxy properties is often cited as evidence for a physical link between smbhs and host galaxies , although ( jahnke & macci 2011 ) showed that such a correlation can naturally arise out of hierarchical merging .    as discussed above , in terms of formation mechanisms",
    ", there is one process that makes haloes contract : dissipative gas accretion ( blumenthal 1986 ) , which must occur to form an elliptical galaxy .",
    "two processes have been investigated that make haloes expand : mass outflows driven by agn feedback ( martizzi 2012 ) ; and dynamical friction between baryons and dark matter during the galaxy assembly process ( el - zant 2001 ) .",
    "dry mergers are likely to be more important at late times , while agn feedback is likely to be more important at early times .",
    "the goal of this study is to determine the impact of dissipationless galaxy assembly on the structure of haloes . in particular",
    ", we wish to know whether dry merging can reverse the effects of halo contraction that are expected to occur in the high redshift progenitors . to achieve this we use fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of @xmath13 haloes using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gasoline .",
    "we use the magicc ( stinson 2013 ) star formation and stellar feedback model which has been shown to produce realistic disk galaxies ( brook 2012 ) and successfully matches the observed galaxy formation efficiencies across cosmic time in haloes less massive than @xmath12 ( stinson 2013 ; wang 2015 ) .",
    "our study improves on previous analytic and n - body calculations ( e.g. , el - zant 2001 ; lackner & ostriker 2010 ) in that our mass assembly histories are fully cosmological , and compared to previous cosmological hydro simulations ( e.g. , johansson 2009 ) our progenitor galaxies have realistic sizes and galaxy formation efficiencies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the simulations including sample selection , hydrodynamics , star formation and feedback models are described in  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "results relating to global parameters such as stellar masses , halo masses , galaxy sizes and circular velocities are presented in  [ sec : global ] .",
    "the radial mass profiles including the response of the dark matter to galaxy formation are presented in  [ sec : haloresponse ] .",
    "we discuss implications for our results in  [ sec : discussion ] and give a summary in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the simulations presented here are fully cosmological `` zoom - in '' simulations of galaxy formation run in a flat cosmology .",
