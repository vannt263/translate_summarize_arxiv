    "hamiltonian _ ,",
    "a ( typically unbounded ) self - adjoint operator , acting in the spatial variable @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "when the solution of   has a time - harmonic form @xmath11 , it is called a _ stationary state _ with energy @xmath12 .",
    "solutions of this kind are in one - to - one correspondence with eigenfunctions @xmath13 and eigenvalues @xmath12 of the hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is often called an _ energy eigenstate _ , and the corresponding @xmath12 is said to be an _ energy level _ of the particle .",
    "the number of linearly independent eigenstates @xmath13 with energy @xmath12 is the _ degeneracy _ of the energy level @xmath12 .",
    "given a hamiltonian @xmath8 , one of the fundamental questions is : what are the energy levels of the system , and what is their degeneracy ?",
    "motion of a single particle subject to an electrostatic field is usually modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass of the particle , @xmath16 is the potential of the electrostatic field , and @xmath17 is the laplace operator .",
    "this model , however , is inconsistent with special relativity , and leads to erroneous results at high energies ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a better model for particles at relativistic energies was proposed by dirac in  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "dirac s equations are much more complicated , and therefore their mathematical treatment is often problematic ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , at least in some applications ( see  @xcite and the references therein , and  @xcite ) , one is often satisfied with an intermediate model , with the hamiltonian @xmath8 given by here @xmath18 is the speed of light , and @xmath19 is often called the _ klein - gordon square root operator _ , or the _ quasi - relativistic hamiltonian_. we often say that @xmath8 describes the motion of a _ quasi - relativistic particle _ in the potential @xmath16 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study the stationary states and their energies for the _ one - dimensional _ quasi - relativistic particle in the _ infinite square potential well _ : in the non - relativistic setting , this model is referred to as the ( one - dimensional ) _ particle in the box _ , since the potential @xmath1 constrains the particle not to leave the ` box ' @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the problem studied in the present article can be described as the _ quasi - relativistic particle in the box_. it is well - known that in this case the spectrum of @xmath8 is purely discrete , and the energy levels form an infinite sequence @xmath21 ( see preliminaries for more details ) .",
    "our main result can be stated as follows .",
    "[ th1 ] all energy levels are non - degenerate , and    it should be emphasized that the operators @xmath22 and @xmath8 are _ non - local_. in the non - relativistic case , one typically solves the equation @xmath23 separately in the intervals @xmath24 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 , and then matches the boundary conditions at @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for the non - local operator @xmath8 , the equation in an interval has no sense unless the values of @xmath28 in the complement of the interval are known .",
    "this means that one can not apply the non - relativistic method ; and indeed , this interval - wise method would yield the erroneous asymptotic formula @xmath29 , with the _ phase shift _ @xmath30 missing .",
    "non - locality of this and similar hamiltonians has caused considerable confusion ; see  @xcite for further discussion .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] follows closely the approach of  @xcite .",
    "the problem studied in  @xcite corresponds to a massless particle , described by the hamiltonian @xmath31 , while  @xcite deals with hamiltonians based on the fractional laplace operator @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the argument relies heavily on the results of  @xcite , where the spectral theory for similar hamiltonians with a _ single infinite potential wall _ ( that is , the potential @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 otherwise ) was studied .",
    "the motivation of the articles cited in this paragraph is purely mathematical . for the discussion of some of their physical implications ,",
    "see preliminaries .",
    "we remark that the weyl - type asymptotic formula @xmath37 as @xmath38 is known since 1959 , due to a general result by r.  m.  blumenthal and r.  k.  getoor  @xcite .",
    "hence , formula   essentially provides the second term ( a phase shift of @xmath30 ) in the asymptotic expansion . in fact , a stronger result is proved , with detailed estimates of the error term @xmath39 .",

    "thanks to the explicit estimate of the error term , it enables passing to a limit in various regimes .",

    "a formal verification is given in section  [ sec : proofs ] .    1 .",

    "the case of the potential well , studied in this article , can be thought as a combination of two potential walls , one at @xmath26 , and the other one at @xmath27 .",
