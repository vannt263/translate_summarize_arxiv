    "in 1993 koveliotou @xcite noticed that the grb distribution can be divided into two subsets of long and short bursts with a dividing duration of 2sec .",
    "as short bursts are also harder than long ones @xcite , they are denoted as short hard bursts ( shbs ) .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) and rate are fundamental quantities to understand the nature of these objects .",
    "guetta & piran ( 2005 ) ( gp05 ) @xcite have shown how these quantities can be constrained by the observed peak flux distribution which is a convolution of these two unknown functions .",
    "afterglows of shb have only recently been observed by swift @xcite and this has lead to the first identification of shb host galaxies and redshift determination . in table 1",
    "we report the redshifts and luminosities of these bursts .",
    "as we can see from this table , the average redshift of the short bursts is @xmath4 much smaller than the average z of the long grbs detected by swift @xmath5 .",
    "as batse is less sensitive to short bursts than to long ones @xcite , even an _ intrinsic _ shb distribution that follows the star formation rate ( sfr ) gives rise to an _ observed _ distribution that is nearer to us .",
    "however the different sensitivity is not enough to explain the different @xmath6-distribution ( @xmath6-df ) between long and short grbs @xcite .",
    "therefore it is possible that shbs do not follow sfr as the long bursts and that they are linked to the merger of double neutron star systems ( dns ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the shb rate is given by the convolution of the star formation rate with the distribution @xmath7 of the merging time delays @xmath8 of the binary system .",
    "these delays reflect the time it takes to the system to merge due to emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "a delayed sfr distribution ( that is intrinsically nearer ) gives rise to an observed distribution that is nearer to us and that can explain the data for some choices of @xmath9 .",
    "we consider two formation mechanisms .",
    "if two massive stars are born as a binary system , and the system remains bound after the super nova ( sn ) explosion of both components , a dns is formed ( `` primordial '' dns ) .",
    "another possibility is that at the moment of star formation the neutron stars ( nss ) are _ not _ in the same binary system , but one of the nss is in a binary with a low mass main sequence ( ms ) star . in globular clusters ( gcs ) , such binaries are likely to have an exchange interaction with a single neutron star ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath10 ) of all ns mergers in the universe may stem from such dynamically formed systems @xcite .",
    "we show that the predicted @xmath6-df is different for the two models , so that future z - observations may determine which formation channel ( if any ) is dominant .",
    ".the _ swift_/hete ii current sample of shbs with a known redshift . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     following schmidt @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we consider a broken power law peak lf with lower and upper limits , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with power law indeces , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and luminosity break @xmath15 .",
    "we use @xmath16 @xcite . in @xcite ( denoted gp06 hereafter ) we show that both limits are chosen in such a way that a very small fraction ( less than 1% ) of the _ observed _ bursts are outside these range . hence one can not infer anything from the observations on the lf in this range . comparing the predicted distribution with the one observed by batse",
    "we obtain , the best fit parameters of each model and their standard deviation .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 and in figs 1 and 2 of gp06 .",
    "we can derive now the expected @xmath6-df of the observed bursts population in the different models .",
    "we assume that the minimal peak flux for detection for _ swift _ is @xmath17 ph/@xmath18/sec like batse ( note the different spectral windows of both detectors which makes _ swift _ relatively less sensitive to short bursts ) .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ( left panel ) depicts the expected _ observed _ integrated @xmath6-df of shbs in the different models . as expected , a distribution that follows the sfr , ( i ) ,",
    "is ruled out by a ks test with the current five bursts ( @xmath19% ) .",
    "this is not surprising as other indications , such as the association of some shbs with elliptical galaxies suggest that shbs are not associated with young stellar populations .",
    "left panel : a comparison between the expected integrated _ observed _ @xmath6-df of shbs for models ( i)-(iv ) and ( ii@xmath20 ) and the distribution of known redshifts of shbs .",
    "right panel : a comparison between the expected integrated _ observed _ @xmath6-df of shbs for dynamically formed dns , title=\"fig : \" ] left panel : a comparison between the expected integrated _ observed _ @xmath6-df of shbs for models ( i)-(iv ) and ( ii@xmath20 ) and the distribution of known redshifts of shbs .",
    "right panel : a comparison between the expected integrated _ observed _ @xmath6-df of shbs for dynamically formed dns , title=\"fig : \" ]    a distribution that follows the sfr with a constant logarithmic delay distribution , ( ii ) , is marginally consistent with the data ( @xmath21% ) .",
    "the observed bursts are nearer ( lower redshift ) than expected from this distribution .",
    "if we use the rowan - robinson sfr @xcite , rather than sf2 of porciani - madau , the situation is even more promising @xmath22% ( for either z=0.7 or z-1.8 ) .",
    "when we move to a distribution that is 1@xmath23 away from the best fit distribution we find @xmath24% and even higher for the rr sfr .",
    "thus the suggestion @xcite that the observed sample rules out the ns merger model ( with a logarithmic merger time distribution ) was somewhat premature .",
    "note however , that the local rate with this model ( ii@xmath20 ) is sixteen times larger than the rate of the best fit model , ( ii ) .",
    "this reflects the large flexibility in modeling the peak flux distribution .    to demonstrate the flexibility of the data we have considered two other time delay distributions . a uniform time delay distribution ( iii ) and an overall constant shb rate ( iv ) .",
    "both models are compatible with the batse shb distribution and with the sample of shbs with a known redshift ( @xmath25 80% and 40% respectively . ) .",
    "this result is not surprising .",
    "the batse peak flux distribution depends on two unknown functions , the rate and the lf .",
    "there is enough freedom to chose one function ( the rate ) and fit for the other .    in all models compatible with the five bursts with a known redshift",
    ", the _ intrinsic _ shb rate is pushed towards lower redshifts .",
    "the inferred present rates , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28gpc@xmath2yr@xmath3 for models ( iii ) , ( iv ) and ( ii@xmath20 ) respectively , are larger by a factor ten to fifty than those estimates earlier ( assuming that sbhs follow the sfr with a logarithmic delay with the best fit parameters gp05 ) .",
    "the corresponding  typical \" luminosities , @xmath15 , ranges from 0.1 to 0.7 @xmath29erg / sec .",
    "let us consider now the possibility that short bursts come from dynamically formed dns @xcite . in this case",
    ", the delay time @xmath8 is a sum of the time @xmath30 until the dynamical formation of a dns during core - collapse , and the time @xmath31 until the dns merges .",
    "the resulting delay function @xmath32 of dynamically formed dnss is given by @xcite    @xmath33    the resulting delay function is shown in fig.2 of @xcite .",
    "fig.1 ( right panel ) shows the comparison between the expected and observed integrates @xmath6-df .",
    "our model for dynamical mergers fits the observed shbs distribution much better ( @xmath34 ) than the model for primordial distribution with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we have repeated the analysis of fitting the batse shb data to a model of the luminosities and rates distributions .",
    "our best fit logarithmic distribution model is similar to the best fit logarithmic model presented in gp05 .",
    "a main new ingredient of this work is the fact that we consider several other models .",
    "we confirm our earlier finding that the batse data allows a lot of flexibility in the combination of the rates and luminosities .",
    "a second new ingredient of this work is the comparison of the best fit models to the small sample of five _ swift_/hete ii shbs .",
    "the _ swift_/hete ii data gives a new constraint .",
    "this constraint favors a population of shbs with a lower intrinsic luminosity and hence a nearer _ observed _ @xmath6-df .",
    "it implies a significantly higher local shb rate - a factor of ten to fifty higher than earlier estimates .",
    "the new observations of swift show that the shbs are nearer than what was expected before and therefore , their luminosity is lower and their local rate is higher .",
    "we stress that this new result was within the 1@xmath23 error of the model presented in gp05 , which had a very large range of allowed local rates and typical luminosities .",
    "provided that the basic model is correct and we are not mislead by statistical ( small numbers ) , observational ( selection effects and threshold estimates ) of intrinsic ( two shb population ) factors we can proceed and compare the inferred shb rate with the observationally inferred rate of ns - ns mergers in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "this rate was recently reevaluated with the discovery of psr j0373 - 3039 to be rather large as @xmath37/myr .",
    "although the estimate contains a fair amount of uncertainty @xcite . if we assume that this rate is typical and that the number density of galaxies is @xmath38/mpc@xmath39 , we find a merger rate of @xmath40/gpc@xmath39/yr . using a beaming factor of 30 - 50 for short bursts @xcite this rate implies a total merger rate of @xmath41/gpc@xmath39/yr for the three cases ( iii ) , ( iv ) and ( ii@xmath20 )",
    "the agreement between the completely different estimates is surprising and could be completely coincidental as both estimates are based on very few events .    if correct these estimates are excellent news for gravitational radiation searches , for which neutron star mergers are prime targets .",
    "they imply that the recently updates high merger rate , that depends mostly on one object , psr j0737 + 3039 , is valid .",
    "these estimate implies one merger event within @xmath42mpc per year and one merger accompanied with a shb within @xmath43mpc .",
    "these ranges are almost within the capability of ligo i and certainly within the capability of ligo ii . if correct these estimates of the rate are excellent news for gravitational radiation searches , for which neutron star mergers are prime targets .",
    "we have considered also the possibility that the dn system is formed dynamically and we have shown that the @xmath6-df of short grbs expected from _ dynamical _ formation and subsequent merger of dnss is markedly different from that expected from primordial dns mergers ( under the assumption that the distribution of delay times for primordial dnss follows @xmath44 ) . the large time for core collapse shifts the distribution of dynamically formed dns mergers to low redshift .",
    "the observed @xmath6-df of short grbs is consistent with that expected for mergers of dynamically formed dnss , and appears to be inconsistent with that expected for primordial dns mergers if the best fit parameters are considered we note , however , that current data do not allow to rule out a @xmath6-df consistent with that expected for primordial dns mergers , since redshifts were obtained only for a minority of the detected short grbs .",
    "this may be due to a bias against obtaining redshift information for high redshift ( faint ) short grbs ( see fig.4 , table  1 and discussion at the end of  3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "future observations should allow to better constrain the @xmath6-df of short grbs , and thus to differentiate between models .",
    "for example , detection of only a few high redshift ( @xmath45 ) short grbs would severely constrain the contribution of dynamically formed dnss .    to conclude",
    "we stress that we have assumed that the luminosity function has a lower limit of @xmath46 .",
    "this was just because even if such a limit does not exists weaker bursts would be barely detected .",
    "the current peak flux distribution of batse burst can not confirm ( or rule out ) the existence of such population ( note however , that tanvir et al .",
    ", @xcite suggest that such a population exists on the basis of the angular distribution of batse shbs ) .",
    "if such weak bursts exist then , of course , the overall merger rate will be much larger @xcite .",
    "such events will provide such a high rate that soon ligo i will begin to constrain this possibility ."
