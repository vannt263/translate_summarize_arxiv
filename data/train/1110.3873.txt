    "the @xmath46 data were analyzed to extract the generalized phonon dos , @xmath90 , in the incoherent scattering approximation .",
    "the data from arcs were integrated over @xmath91 , which minimizes any contribution from magnetic scattering , and the elastic peak was subtracted , and extrapolated with a quadratic @xmath48 dependence for @xmath92mev . a correction for multiphonon scattering",

    "the gdos from the dcs data was obtained by integrating over the full range of @xmath47 ( no multiphonon correction ) @xcite .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ phonondos](a ) for the full gdos ( arcs ) and panel ( b ) for @xmath93mev ( dcs ) .",
    "although the dcs data include a magnetic contribution , this effect is limited , and the doss form arcs and dcs are in excellent agreement , considering the difference in instrument resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ phonondos_dft_comparison ] ) .",
    "the coarser energy resolution in arcs data washes out the three bi - dominated peaks at @xmath94mev , but the two dos curves are otherwise very similar . in bfo ,",
    "the different elements have different ratios of cross - section over mass , @xmath95 , resulting in a weighted phonon dos ( gdos ) .",
    "the values of @xmath95 for ( bi , fe , o ) are ( 0.044 , 0.208 , 0.265 ) , in units of barns / amu , respectively . thus , the modes involving primarily bi motions are under - emphasized in @xmath46 and @xmath90 ( but there is relatively little weighting of fe modes compared to o modes ) .",
    "while the energy - range of the spectrum is comparable with other fe perovskites @xcite , what is striking is the severe broadening of the spectrum with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the gdos measured at @xmath67k is in good agreement overall with the first - principles calculation of wang _ et al .",
    "_ within spin - polarized dft+u @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ phonondos_dft_comparison ] .",
    "this agreement allows for a clear identification of the main features in the dos .",
    "the three peaks at @xmath96mev ( fig .",
    "[ phonondos](b ) ) arise from the top of acoustic branches and the lowest-@xmath48 optic modes , and they are dominated by bi motions .",
    "the lower two bi peaks ( @xmath97mev and @xmath98mev ) are softer than predicted by dft by about 10% @xcite .",
    "these bi modes are responsible for the peak in @xmath99 around @xmath100k reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . the phonon spectrum for @xmath101mev",
    "is mainly comprised of oxygen vibrations , and is stiffer in the measured dos than in the dft calculation @xcite . while the agreement is generally good between the dft calculation of wang _ et al . _ and",
    "the phonon dos measured at low temperature , the @xmath2 dependence of the dos is strongly affected by anharmonicity and spin - phonon coupling , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "as already pointed out above , the phonon dos exhibits a severe broadening with increasing @xmath2 , which affects the whole spectrum .",
    "in particular , the broadening of bi modes at low-@xmath48 is obvious in the dcs data , shown in fig .",
    "[ phonondos]-b .",
    "it is particularly strong between @xmath102k and @xmath83k , with little additional broadening observed further above @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates a coupling between anharmonicity and the loss of the af order .",
    "these results are consistent with the reported observations of strong broadening of raman phonon modes @xcite .",
    "the oxygen modes , dominating the dos between @xmath103mev and @xmath104mev , are also strongly broadened in this @xmath2-range .",
    "we now analyze in more detail the temperature dependence of the three peaks at @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107mev ( resp .",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "the peaks were fitted with gaussians , and the resulting peak centers are plotted as a function of temperature in fig .  [ softening ] .",
    "as may be seen on this figure , all three peaks undergo a pronounced but gradual softening between @xmath111k and @xmath83k , besides the strong broadening .",
    "however , this softening stops around @xmath58 .",
    "this is compatible with the recently reported behavior of @xmath112 raman modes @xcite .",
    "@xmath110 actually appears to stiffen above @xmath58 , but this may partly be due to the influence of broadening and softening of modes at @xmath113mev , causing a skewed contribution to the @xmath110 peak .    the change in phonon softening behavior around @xmath58 is further evidence of the influence of spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the softening of phonon modes with increasing @xmath2 , as observed here for @xmath114k , can generally be related to the thermal expansion of the system through the quasiharmonic approximation @xmath115 , with @xmath116 the grneisen parameter @xcite .",
    "we determined the relative change in volume to be about 1.4% between @xmath111k and @xmath83k from our diffraction measurements ( this was linearly extrapolated over the range @xmath117k , since our diffraction data were limited to @xmath118k ) .",
    "the average relative decrease of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is @xmath119% over the same @xmath2 range , yielding a grneisen parameter @xmath120 .",
    "such a large value of @xmath116 is a further corroboration of the anharmonicity of these bi - dominated modes .",
    "the lack of softening above @xmath83k indicates that an increase in interatomic force - constants associated with the loss of magnetic order compensates for the effect of thermal expansion .",
    "we note that bi and o atoms undergo large amplitude vibrations , according to both our measurements and reports of others @xcite .",
    "since the bi and o modes are sharp at @xmath121k , the large displacements observed in diffraction data are dynamic in nature , rather than associated with static disorder .",
    "these large amplitudes of vibration for bi and o are related to the anharmonic scattering of phonons , which leads to the broadening and softening of features in the dos .",
    "we have also performed measurements of the fe - partial phonon dos with nuclear - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( nrixs ) on @xmath122fe - enriched samples , and observed a more limited broadening of fe modes , in agreement with the smaller thermal displacements of these atoms @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the large thermal displacements and anharmonicity of bi and o modes lead to structural fluctuations , such as variations in fe - o - fe bond lengths and bond angles ( tuning the superexchange interaction ) through tilts and rotations of feo@xmath123 octahedra , that could lead to fluctuations in magnetic coupling .",
    "the magnitude of o thermal motions perpendicular to fe - o bonds actually leads to fluctuations in the fe - o - fe bond angle that are larger ( @xmath124 ) than the variation of average angle with @xmath2 .",
    "reciprocally , the loss of magnetic order induces a change in interatomic force - constants , stiffening the bi vibration modes at low @xmath48 .",
    "the motion of bi atoms is also directly related to the ferroelectricity .",
    "the large - amplitude structural fluctuations could thus lead to steric effects between bi motions and the rotations of oxygen octahedra , yielding a complex coupling between ferroelectric and af magnetic orders .",
    "we have systematically investigated the temperature dependence of the magnetic excitation spectrum and phonon density of states of bifeo@xmath0 over the range @xmath125 , using inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "in addition , we performed neutron diffraction measurements and refined the lattice parameters and thermal displacement parameters over @xmath126 .",
    "we separated the magnon and phonon contributions in the @xmath46 data , and observed a strong resemblance of the magnon spectrum with that of related compounds lafeo@xmath0 and yfeo@xmath0 .",
    "the magnon spectrum was fit satisfactorily with a simple collinear heisenberg model for a g - type antiferromagnet , indicating the limited role of the cycloid on the spin dynamics , as expected from the long period of the cycloid modulation .",
    "the phonon dos obtained from the high-@xmath47 part of the @xmath46 data is in good agreement at low temperatures with the first - principles calculation of wang _ et al .",
    "however , the phonon dos shows a strong temperature dependence , with in particular a pronounced broadening . also ,",
    "both the softening and broadening of features in the dos correlate with the loss of antiferromagnetic order around @xmath127k , indicating the presence of significant spin - phonon coupling , in agreement with recently reported raman measurements @xcite .",
    "the potential influence of large atomic displacements on the modulation of the superexchange interaction , and the concomitant effect of the change in force - constants from the loss of magnetic order were pointed out .",

    "<S> the phonon density of states ( dos ) and magnetic excitation spectrum of polycrystalline bifeo@xmath0 were measured for temperatures @xmath1k , using inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the magnetic spectrum of bifeo@xmath0 closely resembles that of similar fe perovskites , such as lafeo@xmath0 , despite the cycloid modulation in bifeo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any evidence for a spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> a strong @xmath2-dependence of the phonon dos was found , with a marked broadening of the whole spectrum , providing evidence of strong anharmonicity . </S>",
    "<S> this anharmonicity is corroborated by large - amplitude motions of bi and o ions observed with neutron diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> a clear anomaly is seen in the @xmath2 dependence of bi - dominated modes across the nel transition . </S>",
    "<S> these results highlight the importance of spin - phonon coupling in this material . </S>"
