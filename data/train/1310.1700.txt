    "a typical plasma consisting of electrons and positive ions essentially causes temporal as well as spatial variations of collective phenomena due to large - mass difference between these particles .",
    "this asymmetric diversity of collective plasma phenomena can , however , be nullified in pair - ion plasmas consisting of positive and negative ions with equal mass . in the latter , the space - time parity can be maintained because of the same mobility of the particles under electromagnetic forces .",
    "such pair - ion plasmas have been generated in the laboratory , and three kinds of electrostatic modes have been experimentally observed to propagate along magnetic - field lines in paired fullerene - ion plasmas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in many industries such as integrated - circuit fabrication , there requires a plasma source having no energetic electrons in the plasma , since the deposited film is strongly damaged by a high - energy electron .",
    "for this purpose , a radio - frequency plasma source has also been developed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , _ in situ _ measurements of charged particles in the polar mesosphere under nighttime conditions revealed that there exist positively charged nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "such particles have been observed in a region dominated by both positive and negative ions , and very few percentage of electrons .",
    "it was also clarified that the positive charge of these dust particles is due to the dominant charging effects of lighter positive ions compared to the heavier negative ions , and the presence of a very small number of electrons .",
    "furthermore , in an experiment , it has been investigated that dust particles injected in pair - ion plasmas can become positively charged when the number density of negative ions greatly exceeds ( @xmath3 ) that of the electrons @xcite . in space environments ,",
    "the possible role of negative ions has been discussed , and it has been found that dusts can be positively charged if there is a sufficient number density of heavy negative ions ( with mass @xmath4 amu ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in laboratory and space environments , pair - ion plasmas with positively charged dusts and no high - energy electrons may not be unubiquitous .",
    "so , collective plasma oscillations and nonlinear properties of electrostatic as well as electromagnetic waves in these pair - ion plasmas are worth investigating .    to mention few , the nonlinear propagation of solitary waves ( sws ) and shocks in dusty plasmas",
    "have been widely studied for understanding the electrostatic disturbances in space plasma environments as well as in laboratory plasma devices @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that charged dust grains can drastically modify the existing response of electrostatic wave spectra in plasmas depending upon whether the charged dusts are considered to be static or mobile @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in investigating the properties of electrostatic waves in pair - ion plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no detailed theory has been made to study the electrostatic small- as well as large - amplitude waves in dusty pair - ion plasmas with positively charged dusts .",
    "so , our purpose is to investigate the propagation characteristics of electrostatic large- as well as small - amplitude waves in unmagnetized collisionless dusty pair - ion plasma with positively charged dusts .",
    "we show that there exist two modes :  fast \" and  slow \" waves , the properties of which are studied .",
    "we use the pseudopotential approach to study the properties of large - amplitude waves , whereas the reductive perturbation technique is used to investigate korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) solitons . the present work thus generalizes and extends the previous works , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite to include the effects of positively charged dusts , and different mass as well as thermal pressures of ions .",
    "it is shown that in dusty pair - ion plasmas , sws exist with only the negative potential .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional propagation of electrostatic waves in an unmagnetized collisionless dusty plasma consisting of singly charged adiabatic positive and negative ions , and immobile positively charged dusts .",
    "we do not consider the dynamics of charged dusts as they are too heavy to move on the time scale of the ion - acoustic waves .",
    "however , dusts can affect the wave dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the negative ions are heavier than the positive ions , and negative ion number density is much larger than that of electrons so that dusts become positively charged @xcite .",
    "thus , the dominant higher mobility species in the plasma are the positive ions .",
    "the immobile dust particles carry some charges so as to maintain the overall charge neutrality condition given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the unperturbed number density of charged species @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , respectively , stand for positive ions , negative ions and static positively charged dusts ) , @xmath11 @xmath12 is the unperturbed dust charge state .",
    "the condition , in dimensionless form , becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the density ratios .",
    "the basic equations to describe the dynamics of positive and negative ions in one space dimension are @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively , denote the number density , velocity , and mass of @xmath7-species particles .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the elementary charge . also , @xmath24 is the electrostatic potential , @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath26 is the particle s thermodynamic temperature . in eq .",
    ", we have used the adiabatic pressure law : @xmath27 with @xmath28 for each ion - species @xmath29 .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the number of degrees of freedom ] is used for one - dimensional geometry @xmath33 of the system .",
    "we will later see that in the long - wavelength limit , the phase velocity of the fast wave is much greater than the positive - ion thermal velocity .",
    "this certainly justifies our assumption of adiabaticity that thermal conduction can not keep up with the moving wave front .",
    "next , we normalize the physical quantities according to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the ion - acoustic speed with @xmath38 and @xmath39 denoting , respectively , the negative - ion plasma frequency and the debye length .",
    "the space and time variables are normalized by @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "thus , from eqs . - , the normalized set of equations is obtained as : @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where the upper ( lower ) sign of @xmath45 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "corresponds to positive ( negative ) ions . for convenience and to be used later , we denote @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in order to figure out the number of linear wave modes and to study their properties , we assume the perturbed quantities to vary as @xmath48 , i.e. , in the form of oscillations with wave frequency @xmath49 and wave number @xmath50 .",
    "thus , fourier analyzing the eqs . - , we obtain the following    dispersion relation : @xmath51 in which @xmath49 and @xmath50 are normalized by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "the first and second terms on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "are , respectively , due to the presence of positive- and negative - ion species , whereas the constant term @xmath54 on the right - hand side appears due to the effect of charge separation of the species ( deviation from quasineutrality ) .",
    "the dispersion eq . admits two solutions of @xmath55 given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58k^2}$ ] . in order that these solutions are real",
    ", the discriminant @xmath59 must be nonnegative .",
    "we find that the discriminant is positive for all @xmath50 , when @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are satisfied . in eq .",
    ", the positive and negative signs , respectively , correspond to  fast \" and  slow \" wave modes in pair - ion plasmas .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "in dimensional form , we find that the effect of dispersion due to charge separation can not be neglected , because otherwise , for the  fast \" waves of which the phase speed is much larger than the ion - thermal speed , the sum of the two positive terms becomes zero , which is inadmissible .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid the wave damping due to the resonance with either the positive or negative ions , the phase speed is to be much larger than the negative ion thermal speed and much lower than the positive ion thermal speed . in particular , in absence of the charged dusts , and if ions , having the same mass , are in isothermal equilibrium , one can easily recover the dispersion equation ( 6 ) in ref .",
    "furthermore , in particular , for @xmath63 , i.e. , in dust - free plasmas in which ions have the same mass and temperature , the two ion - modes , corresponding to positive and negative signs in eq . , reduce , in the long - wavelength limit @xmath64 , to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , or , in dimensional form , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the former is the usual ion - plasma wave , which propagates with a frequency greater than @xmath52 ( even in absence of the thermal pressure ) , whereas , the latter propagates forward in the manner of a sound wave in which the electrostatic oscillation disappears .",
    "it has been observed in experiments that slow - wave modes do not favor the formation of solitons , whereas the fast modes may propagate as solitary waves due to nice balance of the dispersive and nonlinear effects @xcite . in the next sections , our attempt will be to study whether this ion - plasma wave ( fast mode ) propagates as solitary waves .",
    "however , before going into the detail investigation for the nonlinear propagation , we first analyze numerically the properties of the  fast \" and  slow \" wave modes as follows :                figures 1 to 3 show the plots of the frequencies of the fast- ( upper panel ) and slow - wave ( lower panel ) modes with the variations of the wave number @xmath50 for different sets of parameter values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as indicated in the figures . from fig .",
    "1 , it is evident that both the fast- and slow - wave frequencies increase with @xmath50 as well as with higher values of the mass ratio @xmath69 . in contrast to the fast mode , the slow - wave frequency remains almost unaltered for values of @xmath72 , as well as in the limits of the long - wavelength , @xmath73 and short - wavelength , @xmath74 . in the former limit , though the frequency of the fast mode bears almost a constant value , the slow - wave frequency approaches to zero .",
    "in all the figures 1 to 3 , the wave frequency is found to increase with the wave number @xmath50 implying that the wave phase speed exceeds that of the ion - sound wave .",
    "figure 2 shows the similar profiles as in fig . 1 , but for different values of the temperature ratio @xmath70 .",
    "it is found that @xmath70 , however , does not affect the frequency of the fast - wave mode ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , whereas the slow - wave frequency increases with increasing values of @xmath70 .",
    "in the latter , @xmath49 becomes larger with higher values of @xmath75 .",
    "figure 3 shows that in contrast to the slow - wave modes , the effect of positively charged dusts is to decrease the wave frequency of the fast - wave modes .",
    "it is also seen that for @xmath76 , charged dusts have very small effect on the wave modes .",
    "here , we assume the perturbations to vary in a moving frame of reference @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the nonlinear wave speed normalized by @xmath79 .",
    "we also use the boundary conditions , namely , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 as @xmath83 . then from the continuity equation @xmath84 next , from eq . and",
    "after eliminating @xmath20 , we obtain bi - quadratic equations for the densities @xmath19 which have the following solutions : @xmath85^{1/2 } , \\label{density - p}\\ ] ] @xmath86^{1/2 } , \\label{density - n}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 are the values of the number densities @xmath19 corresponding to the @xmath45 signs .",
    "also , @xmath88 , @xmath89,@xmath90 , and @xmath91 . equations and give four possible combinations for the number densities , namely , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ; @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath92 , @xmath95 and @xmath94 , @xmath93 .",
    "we will later see that only one of them will favor the propagation of large - amplitude solitary waves . from eqs . and",
    "it is clear that for real values of the densities , the conditions @xmath96 and @xmath97 must be satisfied .",
    "these lead to the following bounds for the electrostatic potential : @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 , implying that @xmath24 has the range from negative to positive values .",
    "next , from the poisson equation , after integrating with respect to @xmath101 and using the above boundary conditions , we obtain the following energy - like equation for an oscillating particle of unit mass at the pseudoposition @xmath24 and pseudotime @xmath101 : @xmath102 where the pseudopotential @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 \\notag\\\\ -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3t}}\\left[g_{n\\pm}(\\phi)-g_{n\\pm}(0)\\right],\\label{v - pseudo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath105 and @xmath106 . here , @xmath107 is the value of @xmath108 at @xmath109 . the pseudopotential @xmath103 and",
    "hence the relevant expressions , to be shown shortly , can have four different forms depending on the consideration of the densities @xmath87 given by eqs . and .",
    "however , we will show that only one of them corresponds to the existence of solitary waves or double layers .",
    "the energy - like equation , which describes the evolution of arbitrary amplitude electrostatic perturbations , can also be obtained following refs .",
    "the conditions for which the perturbations may propagate as solitary waves or double layers can be discussed as follows : +   + * condition 1 : * @xmath110 at @xmath109 .",
    "this can be easily verified from eq . by substituting @xmath109 .",
