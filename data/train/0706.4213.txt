    "heisenberg spin 1/2 systems have been investigated extensively both by experimental and theoretical means due to their versatile low - energy physical properties and also because of their relevance to high-@xmath16 superconducting materials .",
    "the search for high-@xmath16 superconductor materials has led to a new structure type@xcite represented by sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 containing both one - dimensional cuo@xmath17 spin chains and two - dimensional cu@xmath17o@xmath18 spin ladders .",
    "planar chains and ladders in this compound extend in @xmath19 axis direction and are alternately stacked along the @xmath8 axis , separated by layers of sr .",
    "chain and ladder spin subsystems in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 interact weakly and are structurally incommensurate although the lattice constants in @xmath19 direction satisfy an approximate relation @xmath20 .",
    "the conductivity in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is associated with the charge dynamics in the ladder layers .",
    "sr substitution for ca and external pressure leads to hole transfer from the chains to the ladders and to the occurrence of superconductivity in sr@xmath21ca@xmath22cu@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath23k at 3gpa.@xcite for a comprehensive overview on the charge and spin dynamics in this class of materials the reader is directed to ref . .",
    "pure sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is a self - doped compound containing six holes per unit cell .",
    "a chain hole occupies oxygen @xmath24 orbitals surrounding a central cu spin and forms a zhang - rice ( zr ) singlet@xcite ( -0- ) , rendering nonmagnetic about 6 out of 10 cu sites .",
    "spin dimers , two cu@xmath25 spins bridged by a zr singlet ( -@xmath26 - 0-@xmath27-),@xcite are in the singlet state .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering,@xcite high energy x - ray diffraction@xcite and nmr@xcite measurements have indicated that dimers organize with a periodicity of 5 chain units and are separated by two zr singlets ( -@xmath26 - 0-@xmath27 - 0 - 0- ) .",
    "recent revised structural studies indicate extensive o atom position modulation out of the chain planes in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite and sr@xmath21ca@xmath22cu@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite this modulation causes variations in the super - exchange between cu atoms along the chain.@xcite in addition , displaced o atoms mediate the hole transfer between chains and ladders .",
    "it is estimated from bond - valence sum calculations , x - ray absorption spectroscopy , magnetization and optical conductivity measurements@xcite that 1 - 4@xmath28 of the self - doped holes reside in the ladders in undoped sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 at low temperature .",
    "the deficiency of holes in the chains means that the perfect alignment of dimers , separated by two zr singlets yielding five chain unit periodicity , can not be satisfied .",
    "there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding spin and charge order in the chains of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and the nature of the underlying ground state .",
    "we studied magnetic excitations using far - infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy and strong magnetic fields with the aim to identify the spin states present in the chains of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "fir transmission spectra were recorded with a polarizing martin - puplett type fourier transform spectrometer sps200 .",
    "samples , a 12 t superconducting magnet , and two 0.3k silicon bolometers were inside a @xmath29he cryostat connected to the spectrometer through light pipe . a rotatable polarizer was placed in front of the sample .",
    "absorption spectra were calculated considering two back reflections from the sample .",
    "spectra in fields above 12 t were measured at nhmfl in tallahassee utilizing bruker ifs113v with a 18 t superconducting magnet and a 4k silicon bolometer .",
    "two single - crystalline samples of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 were used in the current study : a 1.1 mm thick crystal with an @xmath30-plane area of 13.2mm@xmath31 and an @xmath32-plane crystal with an area of 12.6mm@xmath31 and a thickness of 0.65 mm .",
    "polarization - sensitive transmission measurements in the fir spectral region revealed an anisotropic response from the crystal @xmath30 plane . when the external magnetic field was applied along the @xmath19 axis of the crystal ( along the chains ) , two magnetic field dependent modes , t@xmath33 and t@xmath17",
    "were found , which we assign to spin excitations in the chains of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "transitions to the triplet state t@xmath33 were visible when the electric field component @xmath34 of the radiatioan was polarized along the @xmath8 axis",
    ". observed differential absorption spectra , measured in different magnetic fields at 4k , are shown in fig.[specepb ] . in the spectra reference field lines",
    "are pointing downward and lines in the measured fields are pointing upward .",
    "the triplet state has three spin sublevels , @xmath35 what we denote as t@xmath36 , t@xmath37 , and t@xmath38 , see inset to fig.[bothtrips ] .",
    "the resonance frequency of the t@xmath39 level does not shift with field and thus escapes detection .",
    "the transition to the t@xmath40 sublevel loses intensity as the line shifts toward smaller energies in increasing field and gets too weak for detection in fields above 12 t .",
    "the transition to the t@xmath41 level gains intensity with increasing magnetic field up to the observation limit set by the strong phonon background at 92 @xmath13 where the crystal becomes opaque to fir radiation in @xmath42 polarization .    in @xmath43 polarization transitions to the triplet state t@xmath17 are observed ( fig.[specepa ] ) .",
    "transitions to the t@xmath44 level in fields below 2 t and to the t@xmath45 level are masked by strong absorption below 89@xmath13 . to check the light polarization and @xmath46 orientation dependence , measurements on a thinner @xmath32-plane crystal in faraday and voigt configuration",
    "were carried out .",
    "when @xmath47 the triplet t@xmath17 mode disappears from the infrared absorption spectrum .",
    "some absorption lines belonging to the t@xmath45 level were detected in voigt configuration . however , because of strong phononic absorption the intensities of t@xmath45 were not reliable and are not included in fig[bothtrips]a .",
    "the spectral lines were fitted with a lorentzian line shape .",
    "line positions and intensities as a function of magnetic field are displayed in fig.[bothtrips ] .",
    "we assume that t@xmath40 and t@xmath41 are degenerate at @xmath48 t and plot half of the measured line intensity for this field value .",
    "the same holds for the t@xmath17 triplet .",
    "linewidths of both triplets are @xmath49 @xmath13 and do not depend on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding @xmath10 factors are similar , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "additionally we observed a strong paramagnetic signal at 4k with @xmath52 .",
    "the linewidth of the paramagnetic signal was below the used instrumental resolution limit , 0.3@xmath13 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the singlet - triplet resonances was measured as the difference of 0 t and 10 t spectra at temperatures from 4k to 60k , see fig.[tdep ] .",
    "fig.[tdep]b shows absorption lines in 0 t field for triplet t@xmath3 .",
    "sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is not transparent in @xmath43 polarization at zero field line position frequencies of t@xmath4 and therefore we analyze the @xmath14 dependence of this triplet level in 10 t field . although both lines broaden and lose intensity as temperature increases , the @xmath14 dependence of line positions is different .",
    "the t@xmath33 triplet resonance shifts notably toward higher energies whereas the energy of t@xmath17 remains unchanged , see fig.[tdep]c .",
    "the dispersion curves of two magnetic excitations , acoustic and optic , with respective energies 11mev and 12.5mev at @xmath15 points equivalent to @xmath53 have been measured by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) spectroscopy.@xcite a good fit of the experimental data was obtained by the simplest model for a weakly coupled dimer system .",
    "the dispersion in the @xmath19 axis direction follows a cosine form with the periodicity of 0.2 reciprocal lattice units ( fig.[disp ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of ins data demonstrated that with rising temperature the dispersion curves flatten out since the inter - dimer couplings become negligible due to thermal fluctuations and the dimers behave more like isolated dimers .",
    "as the dispersion curves flatten , the acoustic mode at @xmath15 space points near the brillouin zone edge @xmath54 shift toward higher energies while the triplet state energy at @xmath55 does not change ( reciprocal lattice units @xmath56 and @xmath57 are integers in our discussion ) .",
    "in contrast to these considerations , the energy of the optic branch at @xmath54 in the momentum space displays no temperature dependence while the energy near @xmath55 lowers notably with temperature .",
    "it follows from the momentum conservation that an absorbed infrared photon creates a triplet excitation with @xmath58 equal to photons momentum , @xmath59 , this is in the center of brillouin zone .",
    "ins data@xcite shows no excitation at 9.65mev in the center of the brillouin zone that would correspond to the triplet excitation t@xmath33 , seen in fir spectra .",
    "a possible explanation to overcome this discrepancy with ins results is to consider zone folding .",
    "doubling of the unit cell size in the @xmath19 axis direction is consistent with fir data since then the energy of the back folded acoustic branch at @xmath54 point would coincide with the energy of t@xmath33 , see fig.[disp ] . indeed , the triplet mode t@xmath33 has a similar temperature dependence of its energy as the acoustic mode at @xmath15 points equivalent ( any integer value of @xmath56 and @xmath60 ) to @xmath54 . we conclude that a magnetic unit cell of 10@xmath61 is compatible with our results .",
    "the triplet t@xmath17 has an energy similar to the acoustic mode at ( h , k,0 ) . in the folded zone picture",
    "the ( h , k,0.1 ) point moves to the center of the brillouin zone and is infrared - active as well . due to the experimental uncertainty of the ins experiment ( @xmath620.5 mev ) and a similar temperature dependence of acoustic and optic modes at this energy ( @xmath63mev )",
    "we can not determine exactly whether the triplet t@xmath17 belongs to the acoustic or the zone folded optic branch of excitations , seen by ins .",
    "however , the @xmath15 points equivalent to @xmath55 points of the acoustic excitation are closer in the energy scale to the triplet level t@xmath17 , seen by fir .",
    "consequently we assign triplet t@xmath17 to the chain acoustic excitation branch ( in ins notation ) at @xmath53 point in the momentum space and refine the spin gap value for this point to 10.86mev ( 87.7@xmath13 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of intensity of the observed fir transitions , @xmath64 , is proportional to the population difference of singlet and triplet levels if we assume that the transition matrix element is independent of temperature .",
    "following the boltzmann distribution we get @xmath65/[1 + 3n \\exp(-\\delta / k_{b}t)]$ ] , where @xmath66 is the number of triplet states , each 3-fold degenerate , and @xmath67 is the singlet - triplet energy gap ; we used an averaged value @xmath68mev for all triplets .",
    "the solid line ( fig.[tdep]d ) indicates the calculated normalized transition intensity for a system with two triplet states and the dashed line for four triplet states in the new folded zone structure .",
    "theoretical curves qualitatively explain the decrease in intensity . as the lines",
    "broaden with temperature , the determination of line area becomes less accurate and thus @xmath14 dependence of intensity can not distinguish whether two or four triplet states exist .    in the fir we observed two distinct magnetic signals at 4k .",
    "firstly , the transitions from the singlet ground state to triplet states t@xmath33 and t@xmath17 , and secondly , a paramagnetic signal .",
    "it is not expected that the paramagnetic response at 4k originates from a thermally excited triplet state in the chains due to a large spin gap , @xmath69mev .",
    "there is evidence from susceptibility and esr measurements that unpaired spins exist in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath10 factor of the paramagnetic signal @xmath52 obtained from our experiments matches that of esr @xmath70=2.038 at 4k.@xcite above 20k when the triplets are thermally populated , the esr detects transitions between triplet levels @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath10 factors of both triplets measured in fir , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , coincide with averaged value @xmath73 from esr.@xcite fir measurements confirm directly that unpaired spins have @xmath74 similar to spin dimers @xmath10 factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "similar @xmath74 components of the @xmath10 tensor suggest a common local environment , as was proposed in ref .",
    ", for the triplet and the paramagnetic site magnetic moments .",
    "unpaired spins are in chains , instead of ladders .",
    "unpaired cu@xmath25 spins in the chain subsystem destroy the perfect charge order with @xmath77 periodicity and are in accord with the fir active triplet t@xmath33 which , as we discussed above , is a result of doubling of the unit cell .    at 20k the linewidths of the singlet to triplet transitions seen in fir is about 200 times larger than the esr transitions,@xcite @xmath78 .",
    "the difference between the two experimental probes is that fir transitions are across the spin gap while esr transitions are within the triplet state .",
    "it is natural to assume that it is the distribution of spin gaps what makes the 200-fold increase of triplet linewidth in fir spectroscopy compared to esr linewidth . indeed ,",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite have demonstrated that there is a substantial fluctuation , 8% , of intradimer exchange coupling , @xmath79mev , which contributes the most to the size of the spin gap .",
    "this inhomogeneous distribution should give a gaussian and not a lorentzian lineshape .",
    "however , there is inter - dimer exchange , @xmath80mev , that reduces the effect of inhomogeneous broadening and restores the lorentzian lineshape , an effect similar to motional narrowing .",
    "now we discuss selection rules of the observed singlet - triplet transitions .",
    "we have determined by measuring the crystals in different experimental geometries that both singlet - triplet transitions are electric dipole active . @xmath42",
    "polarized light excites the triplet state t@xmath33 and @xmath43 light promotes singlets to the t@xmath17 triplet state .",
    "the electric field component of light can not directly couple to a spin system . in order to explain our observations we consider a spin - phonon coupling mechanism where light couples to a phonon mode that lowers the symmetry of the lattice and generates an antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction which couples singlet and triplet states .",
    "this dynamic dm transition mechanism has been successful in describing observed electric dipole active transitions in srcu@xmath17(bo@xmath18)@xmath4 @xcite and @xmath81-nav@xmath17o@xmath82 .",
    "@xcite    there are several observations that suggest a dynamic dm interaction in spin chains of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "firstly , the dependence on the light polarization .",
    "the dynamic dm vector @xmath83 is perpendicular to @xmath34 and to the spin dimer axis that is the @xmath19 axis in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the triplet t@xmath3 interacts with electric field vector of the light @xmath42 and @xmath83 is parallel to @xmath84 axis for this triplet .",
    "the triplet t@xmath4 interacts with the polarization @xmath43 and @xmath83 is parallel to @xmath8 axis .",
    "the selection rules are : i ) if @xmath85 then the transition to t@xmath37 is allowed and ii ) if @xmath86 then transitions to t@xmath36 and to t@xmath38 are allowed .",
    "one can see from figs.[specepb ] and [ specepa ] that the selection rules are satisfied : t@xmath36 and t@xmath38 transitions are observed when @xmath87 , selection rule ii ) is satisfied .",
    "moreover , when the magnetic field was aligned along the @xmath8 axis then the t@xmath88 line disappeared in @xmath43 geometry ( fig.[specepa ] ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the dynamic dm mechanism selection rule i ) .",
    "secondly , the dependence of transition intensities on magnetic field . according to eq.[eq_intensity ]",
    "a shift in energy of the triplet level reduces ( increases ) the separation between the triplet level and the relevant phonon mode and increases ( decreases ) coupling between the triplet and phonon states .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the intensity of the triplet t@xmath33 excitation , fig.[bothtrips]a , was fitted with singlet - triplet transition probabilities for the dynamic dm model using eq.13 and 14 from ref .",
    ": @xmath89 ^ 2}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\    { 2[(\\hbar\\omega_{ph})^2 - ( \\delta + g\\mu _ b b_0)^2]^2}\\ , .",

    "the fit converged to a phonon at @xmath94@xmath13 .",
    "a phonon has been detected at 95 @xmath13 by reflectivity measurements . in order to determine whether this 95 @xmath13 phonon is the driving force behind the dynamic dm interaction in this compound normal mode calculations have to be performed .",
    "to our knowledge this has not been done yet .",
    "unfortunately , the limited @xmath95 range does not allow us to determine the dynamic dm - active @xmath84-axis optical phonon of t@xmath4 triplet unambiguously .",
    "we have reported the magnetic field and temperature dependence of two triplet modes in the chains of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 with zero field excitation energies @xmath96@xmath13 and @xmath97@xmath13 at 4k .",
    "the triplet excitation at 77.8@xmath13 has not been observed before at the center of brillouin zone .",
    "hence the presently accepted spin lattice model for the chains in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is incomplete and must include a triplet excitation at 77.8 @xmath13 at @xmath98 .",
    "we propose a back - folding of the triplet branches ( observed in ins ) due to the doubling of the magnetic supercell from 5 to 10 chain units .",
    "the determination of @xmath10 factors for free spins and triplets gave additional evidence that unpaired spins are in the chains and therefore the 5 chain unit periodicity can not be retained .",
