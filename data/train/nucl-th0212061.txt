    "shape coexistence phenomena have been suggested in many @xmath7-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of the famous shape coexistence has been known in @xmath1si , in which the structure of the ground band is oblate , and an excited band starting from a @xmath8 state at 6.691 mev is considered to be a prolately deformed band . on the other hand , resonances in the @xmath5c+@xmath6o(c - o ) excitation functions have been experimentally observed in the elastic , inelastic , other exit channels and fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "these molecular resonances lie in the excitation energy region @xmath9 30 - 50 mev in @xmath1si .",
    "another group of levels in the excitation energy region from 18 to 30 mev observed in @xmath4 transfer reactions @xcite indicates an @xmath4-cluster structure of @xmath1si .",
    "the first subject in the present paper is the shape coexistence in @xmath0 isotones .",
    "it is a challenging problem whether or not shape coexistence is found in unstable @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the second subject is systematic study on structures and cluster behaviour of the excited states of in @xmath1si including the high - lying molecular resonances .",
    "there were many theoretical efforts for study on the @xmath1si structures .",
    "for example , the shape coexistence in the low - energy region was studied with mean field approaches and @xmath10 cluster models @xcite , while the molecular resonances were discussed with c - o cluster models@xcite .",
    "however we have not comprehended features of those rotational bands observed in the wide energy interval . in the present paper ,",
    "we systematically study the shape coexistence and the molecular resonant features in @xmath1si .",
    "we apply a microscopic method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) @xcite .",
    "an amd wave function is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets ;    @xmath11 , \\label{eqn : single}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the centers of gaussians ( @xmath12 ) are complex variational parameters . in the present paper , the intrinsic spin and isospin part @xmath13",
    "is fixed to be a up / down proton or neutron . in order to obtain an intrinsic wave function of a level , we vary the parameters @xmath12 to minimize the energy expectation value for the parity eigen - state projected from a slator amd wave function by using a frictional cooling method . after the energy variation , we perform total angular momentum projection . for the study of highly excited states ,",
    "we apply the amd method with constraint . in the present calculations ,",
    "we adopt the constraint on total principal quanta @xmath14 of the spherical harmonic oscillator . after the energy variation ( variation with the constraint @xmath15 after parity projection )",
    ", we superpose the spin - parity projected states to diagonalize the hamiltonian and norm matrixes with respect to the generator coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "we studied the structures of @xmath0 isotones : @xmath1si , @xmath2b , and @xmath3ne .",
    "the adopted interactions in the present work are the central force of the modified volkov no.1@xcite with case 3 ( @xmath17 ) , the spin - orbit force of g3rs@xcite ( @xmath18 mev ) and the coulomb force .",
    "we choose an optimum width parameter ( @xmath19 ) for the gaussians of the single - particle wave functions of each nucleus .",
    "we study the normal parity states of @xmath1si , @xmath2b and @xmath3ne with simple amd calculations(parity projection before variation and angular momentum projection after variation ) .",
    "the ground band of @xmath1si is known to be oblate , while the excited rotational band starting from a @xmath8 state at 6.6914 mev is considered to be prolate .",
    "many studies with @xmath10-cluster models failed to describe the large energy interval between the oblate and prolate states . in the present amd calculations",
    ", we obtained two local minima with oblate and prolate deformation .",
    "the important point in the amd results is that we can reproduce the large excitation energy of the prolate state because of the energy gain of the spin - orbit force .    in the calculated results of @xmath2b",
    ", we also found two local minima with oblate and prolate deformation of neutron density as seen in fig.[fig : beta ] for the deformation parameters .",
    "the present calculations suggest an oblate ground state and a prolate excited state as well as @xmath1si , though excited states in @xmath2b have not been experimentally measured yet . in the calculated prolate states with a few mev excitation",
    ", it was found that a cluster structure like @xmath20he+@xmath21li develops .",
    "the deformation parameters for proton density are @xmath22 in the oblate state , and @xmath23 in the prolate state .",
    "it means that the proton matter shape in @xmath2b correlates with the deformation of neutron density .",
    "therefore measurement of @xmath24-moment will be a good probe to know the deformation of @xmath2b .",
    "since the calculated @xmath24-moments qualitatively depend on the adopted forces , systematic analysis of @xmath24-moments along b isotopes is rather helpful . in the present calculations ,",
    "the @xmath24-moment of the oblate @xmath25 state of @xmath2b is almost same as or even less than that of @xmath26b , while that of the prolate @xmath25 state of @xmath2b is 20 % larger than @xmath26b .    in @xmath3ne ,",
    "two local minima were found , however , the features of deformation are different from those in @xmath1si and @xmath2b . that is to say , both minima have prolate deformation of neutron density .",
    "the smaller prolate deformation is lowest , while deformation is larger in the excited band . since the lowest state with smaller deformation gains the spin - orbit force",
    ", we consider that it has an analogous neutron structure with those in the oblate states in @xmath2b and @xmath1si .",
    "the reason for the small prolate deformation in @xmath3ne is a trend of the prolately deformed proton structure in ne isotopes",
    ". another interesting feature of shape in @xmath3ne is a discrepancy between proton(@xmath27 ) and neutron(@xmath28 ) deformation in the ground band : @xmath22 and @xmath29 .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath30 for protons(neutrons ) is @xmath31 e@xmath32@xmath33 ( @xmath34 e@xmath32@xmath33 ) . in spite of the large number of valence neutrons , the strength for neutrons @xmath35",
    "is not so large , which is caused by the small deformation of the neutron density .",
    "we studied the structure of the ground , excited and molecular resonant states with amd calculations with constraint on the principal quanta of the spherical harmonic oscillator @xmath36 . with a given value @xmath16 and each parity",
    ", we performed energy variation and find some local minima , which are based on the coexisting minima in the low - energy region . concerning the superposition of the obtained states , we chose 23 amd wave functions as base states in the diagonalization for each parity .    by analyzing the amplitudes of the base states after diagonalization , we can classify many of the excited states into two groups .",
    "the first group consists of prolate states , while the second group is a family based on oblate states . in the first group of prolately deformed states with positive parity",
    ", we found three rotational @xmath37 bands which are regarded as members of c - o molecular bands .",
    "the calculated lowest band well corresponds to the observed prolate band starting at 6.69 mev .",
    "the second and third bands are the higher excited bands with molecular excitation in the inter - cluster motion .",
    "these are actually dominated by @xmath5c and @xmath6o cluster states . in the extracted inter - cluster wave functions between the @xmath38 limit c@xmath39 and o@xmath39 clusters",
    ", it was found that the lowest band has the minimum number @xmath40 of nodes in pauli allowed states , while the relative motion in the second and third bands have 9 and 10 nodes , respectively . in the energy region around the third bands , there exist many experimental levels with the c - o molecular resonant behaviour @xcite . in the negative parity states with prolate deformation",
    ", we found three - body cluster features consisting of c-@xmath4-c structure . as a result , two rotational bands with @xmath41 consist of the axial asymmetric c-@xmath4-c structure",
    "the three - body(c-@xmath4-c ) cluster features have been studied with a model of three structure - less clusters@xcite .    in the family of oblate states ,",
    "the calculated results indicate exotic shapes in the negative parity states belonging to low - lying @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands .",
    "for example , a pentagon shape composes the @xmath44 band .",
    "the results well correspond to the experimental energy levels and strength of in - band @xmath45 transitions of the @xmath46 bands @xcite . in the positive parity states , the calculated lowest band has oblate deformation which is consistent with the experimental feature of the ground band . above the ground band ,",
    "a band with mg-@xmath4 cluster structure appears at about 10 mev excitation energy .",
    "the moment of inertia of this band is lower ( with a rotational parameter @xmath47 kev ) than the second and third c - o molecular bands ( @xmath48 99 and 74 kev ) .",
    "this excited band is considered to be a higher band with molecular excitation in the mg-@xmath4 channel based on the oblate ground band . in other words ,",
    "an @xmath4 cluster in the ground state comes outward to make a higher nodal relative motion between the @xmath4 and the mg core . around the corresponding excitation energy",
    ", there is a group of the experimental levels observed in @xmath4 transfer reactions @xcite .",
    "we investigated the structure of @xmath0 isotones with the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics .",
    "shape coexistence of neutron density was theoretically suggested in the low - energy region of @xmath2b and @xmath3ne .",
    "we also performed systematic study of the ground , excited states and molecular resonant states in @xmath1si .",
    "molecular resonant states appear in the c - o channels due to the excitation of the inter - cluster motion .",
    "the c - o resonances can be connected with the lowest prolate band .",
    "the other resonances in the mg-@xmath4 channel are obtained at about 10 mev excitation .",
    "they are considered to be the other molecular excited states based on the oblate structure in the ground band .",
    "we also found the c-@xmath4-c behaviour in the negative parity bands . in the high - lying states ,",
    "the molecular states with inter - cluster excitation were found in various kinds of channels , which are based on the coexisting deformed states in the low energy region .",
    "it is an interesting future problems to search for molecular states in unstable @xmath7-shell nuclei .",
