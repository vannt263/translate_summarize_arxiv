    "when co and ni are doped into bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 , partially replacing fe and contributing additional electrons to the feas layer , superconductivity is induced @xcite and static order is gradually suppressed . additionally , the low - energy ( @xmath19 mev ) spin excitations become broader than the spin waves in undoped bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 and couple with superconductivity in the form of a neutron spin resonance similar to the superconducting copper oxides @xcite .",
    "however , high - energy ( @xmath20 mev ) spin excitations remain weakly electron - doping dependent and are reminiscent of spin waves in the undoped bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 @xcite . in concert",
    ", these results suggest that low - energy spin excitations in electron - doped bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 family of materials arise from itinerant electrons and fermi surface nesting @xcite , while high - energy spin excitations are related to local moments and are insensitive to changes in fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "although ins experiments on bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 family of iron pnictides over the past several years have established the basic characteristics of the electron and hole - doping evolution of spin excitations and their coupling to superconductivity @xcite , it is equally important to determine if the features found in bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 family of materials are universal for other iron pnictide superconductors .",

    "we know that total magnetic bandwidth in nafeas is considerably smaller than that of bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the density functional theory ( dft ) combined with dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculation that the increased iron pnictogen height in nafeas increases the electron correlations ( localizations ) and narrows spin - wave bandwidth compared with that of bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 @xcite .",

    "since the effective magnetic exchange coupling constants of nafeas @xcite are considerably smaller than those of bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 @xcite , it will be instructive to systematically map out the overall spin excitations spectra in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as and compare the result with those of bafe@xmath10ni@xmath1as@xmath11 family of materials @xcite .",

    "co@xmath1as and ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath11as@xmath11 in the ( a , d ) parent@xcite , ( b , e ) optimally doped@xcite , and ( c , f ) overdoped@xcite regimes respectively .",
    "arpes results show the @xmath110 and @xmath111 bands are hole - like whereas @xmath112 and @xmath113 are electron bands .",
    "dashed lines indicate a band is very near but just below the fermi surface . ]",
    "through a comprehensive survey of spin excitations in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as , we establish electron doping evolution of the spin excitation spectra for this family of iron pnictide superconductors . figure 11",
    "compares the electron doping evolution of the fermi surfaces of nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as @xcite and ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath11as@xmath11@xcite obtained from angle resolve photoemission spectroscopy experiments , where the red , green , and purple colors mark @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 orbital characters of the fe @xmath117 electrons . in spite of the clear differences in the fermi surfaces of undoped nafeas and bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 , the effects of electron - doping by partially substituting co for fe are similar .",
    "namely , the electron fermi surfaces are enlarged and the hole fermi surfaces are drastically reduced .",
    "superconductivity vanishes when hole pockets near @xmath118 sink below fermi surface due to electron over - doping , destroying the hole - electron fermi pockets nesting condition .",
    "this reinforces the view that while the nesting condition is not sufficient for the presence of superconductivity , the correlation of its destruction with the disappearance of superconductivity suggests it is a necessary condition for some iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "our systematic measurements of the overall spin excitation spectra in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as family of materials are consistent with the picture where the low - energy spin excitations are coupled with the fermi surface nesting condition while high - energy spin excitations are much less co - doping dependent .",
    "the evolution of spin excitations in the bafe@xmath10ni@xmath1as@xmath11 family of materials paints a very similar picture @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that in spite of the large differences in spin excitation bandwidth amongst the nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as , bafe@xmath10ni@xmath1as@xmath11 , and fese families of materials , their total spin fluctuating moments are comparable to within @xmath1850% and decrease with increasing electron doping .",
    "this is surprising given that these families of iron - based superconductors have rather different crystal structures and ground states : bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 has nearly coupled structural and magnetic phase transitions with a static ordered moment of @xmath1190.8 @xmath120fe @xcite , nafeas has separated structural and magnetic phase transitions with @xmath121fe @xcite , and fese is a superconductor without static af order @xcite .",
    "their similar total spin fluctuating moments suggest that the microscopic origin for magnetism , and possibly also superconductivity , is the same for these materials .",
    "co@xmath1as ( @xmath49 ) and ( b ) the difference in susceptibility between the superconducting ( @xmath122 k ) and normal ( @xmath123 k ) state .",
    "high temperature data are measured from the same samples and environment as other data for @xmath49 in the present report . ]",
    "it has been widely observed that there is a gain in low energy spin fluctuations , dubbed the neutron spin resonance , upon entering the superconducting state , suggesting a close connection between superconductivity and magnetic fluctuations .",
    "quantitatively , it is reasonable to assume a connection if the energy gain from these fluctuations is larger than the superconducting condensation energy .",
    "this was shown to be the case in ba@xmath124k@xmath125fe@xmath11as@xmath11@xcite where an exchange energy @xmath126 mev / fe was much larger than the condensation energy @xmath127 - 0.09 mev / fe .",
    "following the same procedure , we consider if the same is true in near optimally doped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as . the local susceptibility above and below @xmath12 , shown in fig .",
    "12(a ) , gives rise to an exchange energy of @xmath128 mev / fe , while the condensation energy , calculated from the specific heat of a similarly doped compound @xcite , was found to be @xmath129=-0.008 mev / fe .",
    "while these compounds have similar exchange energies , the superconductivity in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as is substantially more fragile , and is several orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange energy associated with resonance .",
    "therefore , our results are consistent with the notion that spin excitations are responsible for superconductivity in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as .",
    "in conclusion , using tof ins spectroscopy , we have mapped out the overall spin excitations spectra for nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as with @xmath130 .",
    "our central conclusion is that the electron - doping evolution of the spin excitations spectra in this family of iron pnictides is similar to those of electron - doped bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 family of materials , in spite of their large differences in structure and total magnetic excitation energy bandwidth . given the similarities present across different families of iron pnictides , our data suggest they share a microscopic origin for magnetism and superconductivity and highlight the coupling between their spin excitations superconductivity @xcite .",

    "typically , tof ins data is normalized using a vanadium standard for samples with known mass in the neutron beam .",
    "the nafe@xmath0co@xmath11as system , however , is more difficult to normalize by the sample mass as there is often residual powder flux trapped in the single crystal sample during its formation , especially at high co - doping concentrations .",
    "this fact makes normalization purely by vanadium unreliable as the single crystal mass contributing to coherent scattering may be lower than the weighed mass .",
    "because we wanted to compare spin excitation intensities directly across several dopings and with other iron - based superconductors , we sought self - consistent normalization which could be checked against an external standard .",
    "this requires a comparison of the structural properties rather than magnetic ones , and due to the varied incident energies measured for each composition ( table i ) as well differing detector geometries , there were not many viable options .",
    "we identified one optical phonon as well as one acoustic phonon usable for self - consistent normalization and one acoustic phonon used for absolute normalization .",

    "blue line is a weighted average . ]       when desiring to directly compare intensities of tof ins data , it is of paramount importance that care is taken when subtracting the background .",
    "background due to the sample environment can , in principle , be determined by measuring an empty environment without sample .",
    "we chose not to do this but instead focused our efforts on increasing counting statistics .",
    "this is reasonable considering a majority of the low energy background is not from aluminum , but rather phonons from the sample itself .",
    "thus , the first challenge comes from carefully fitting and subtracting background due to low - energy phonons . upon reaching higher energies ,",
    "the spin excitations broaden as they disperse toward the zone boundary wave vectors . near the band top ,",
    "the excitations become broad and diffusive occupying a large fraction of the zone boundary , making it tricky to discern true intensity from background .",
    "distinct energy regions we identified each require their own background fitting solution .        at low energies ,",
    "the background is predominantly due to phonons and detector quirks .",
    "it should be noted that all tof measurements were performed in the same orientation , tying the @xmath136 component of @xmath98 to the incident and transferred energies .",
    "this is reasonable since triple axis measurements have revealed only a weak @xmath136-dependence in spin excitations of nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as @xcite removing the need to consider @xmath136 values . given that the phonons are well defined in @xmath98 and @xmath137 , measurements made at different incident energies will result in different phonon backgrounds .",
    "fortunately , the phonon background in the vicinity of the af wave vector is always quite broad .",
    "this is because the af wave vector is at the edge of the structural zone boundary .",
    "so the dispersion is already quite flat when it reaches the af wave vector .",
    "this broad nature , alongside the high symmetry of the twinned crystal , leads to nearly isotropic features .",
    "an example of our background fitting and subtraction process is highlighted in figure 16 .",
    "figure 16(a ) shows the raw data with @xmath138 mev at energy transfer of @xmath139 mev .",
    "we first mask signal at af wave vectors shown in white boxes in fig .",
    "we then fit a radial background by integrating rings of constant @xmath98 and @xmath137 after masking the data [ fig .",
    "intensity was fit using a high - order polynomial with order decreasing with energy .",
    "masking was done by fitting transverse and longitudinal cuts and omitting data within three half - width at half - max of peak centers [ fig .",
    "16(b ) ] . additionally , we found a large background component along the vertical direction of detector tubes .",
    "in fact , each detector bank had a distinctly different profile .",
    "this may be due in part to the large asymmetry of our sample mount along the vertical direction .",
    "background parallel to the detector tubes was also fit after subtracting the radially symmetric component [ fig .",
    "a masked low-@xmath98 region was used for this fitting .",
    "this method was used for energy transfers below @xmath102 mev . the background subtracted data is shown in fig .",
    "16(e ) , where we find clear magnetic excitations at the expected af wave vectors .    for energy transfers above @xmath102 mev , near the optical phonon cutoff , the background becomes well behaved .",
    "it can be described well with a linear radial component and a component in the direction parallel to the detector tubes as described above .",
    "the challenge in fitting a radial background is the increased diffusion of signal throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "the solution takes advantage of the lack of dispersion along the radial direction . a longitudinal and transverse cut through the af wave vector",
    "were fit simultaneously , restricting the background at the af wave vector to be the same .",
    "essentially , the background is viewed a cone in @xmath98 with an offset . as such",
    ", the longitudinal cut was fit with a gaussian atop a linear background and the transverse cut was fit with properly constrained gaussians atop a hyperbola .",
    "the number of gaussians in the transverse cut were chosen empirically , with three gaussians per side from @xmath140 mev to accommodate scattering at [ @xmath391,@xmath391 ] and two gaussians per side @xmath19 mev .",
