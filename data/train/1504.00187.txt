    "the generation of entangled states in quantum systems represents a central challenge for quantum information processing and fundamental tests of quantum theory .",
    "tremendous progress has been achieved in particular with the development of methods to efficiently counter various ( and essentially unavoidable ) sources of noise , such as coupling to the environment .",
    "recently , it was realized that noise and coupling to the environment are not always detrimental , and can be used advantageously in certain situations @xcite .",
    "while these schemes allow only for transient entanglement , it was shown that steady - state entanglement can be obtained from dissipative processes @xcite .",
    "the creation of steady - state entanglement was investigated for trapped ions @xcite , atoms in cavities @xcite , superconducting @xcite and spin qubits @xcite , and nanomechanical systems @xcite , with experimental implementations reported @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients are engineered decay processes and quantum bath engineering @xcite .",
    "these approaches drive the system into a single fixed point corresponding to an entangled state , but require an external coherent driving field , which can be considered a source of work .",
    "it is thus natural to ask if steady - state entanglement can be generated via incoherent interactions with thermal environments alone .",
    "indeed , this can be achieved in a situation of thermal equilibrium , by placing a system featuring entanglement in the ground state in thermal contact with a cold bath .",
    "more interestingly it was shown that steady - state entanglement can be generated far from equilibrium , without using any source of coherence or external control .",
    "the first example considered an atom coupled to two cavities and driven by incoherent light @xcite .",
    "subsequent work discussed this problem in the context of many - body systems @xcite , interacting spins @xcite , and atoms placed in a thermal environment @xcite .",
    "steady - state entanglement was also shown to be beneficial for transport @xcite and cooling @xcite .",
    "more generally , the potential of thermal entanglement generation is still not well understood .",
    "in particular , coupling to a thermal environment is arguably the most common and natural source of dissipation , hence using it advantageously may lead to novel experimental possibilities in the context of quantum information , and might also give insight into possible generation of entanglement in biological systems @xcite .",
    "here we discuss this problem in what is arguably the simplest possible setting : two resonant qubits , each in weak thermal contact with a heat bath . placing the two heat baths at different temperatures results in a net heat current passing through the system , which can generate steady - state entanglement far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "our setup makes use of a source of free energy ( i.e. two heat baths at different temperatures ) and can thus be considered a thermal machine for generating steady - state entanglement .",
    "the machine is autonomous in the sense that it uses only incoherent interactions with thermal baths , but no source of coherence or external control .",
    "we investigate the amount of entanglement that can be generated with respect to the coupling parameters and temperatures of the baths .",
    "then we illustrate the practical relevance of our model by discussing two implementations in superconducting flux qubits @xcite , and in a semiconductor double quantum dot @xcite .",
    "thanks to their coherence properties and high tunability in the quantum regime , these systems are natural candidates to test the limits of dissipation processes as a resource for steady - state entanglement . +",
    "we consider two qubits with identical energy gaps @xmath0 weakly coupled to each other and to separate thermal reservoirs ( figure  [ fig.twoqubitscheme ] ) .",
    "we denote the ground and excited states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the free hamiltonian for the qubits in this basis is @xmath3 the interaction hamiltonian , which is energy conserving , is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the strength of the coupling between the qubits .",
    "the coupling to the thermal baths is modelled using a simple collision model where thermalisation happens through rare but strong events . at every time step ,",
    "each qubit @xmath6 is either reset to a thermal state @xmath7 at the temperature of its bath with a small probability or left unchanged .",
    "the state of the qubits evolves according to the master equation @xmath8 + \\sum_{k \\in \\{c , h\\ } } p_k ( \\phi_k(\\rho ) - \\rho)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the thermalisation rate for qubit @xmath6 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "that is , at equilibrium the steady state of the two qubits is always separable .",
    "however , when moving away from equilibrium by choosing different temperatures for the two baths , hence establishing a heat current from the hot to the cold bath , steady - state entanglement can be generated as we will now see .",
