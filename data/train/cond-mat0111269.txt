    "the discovery of the high tc superconducting cuprates @xcite have stimulated the revival studies of a variety of transition - metal oxides from modern theoretical and experimental view points . among them , special attention is placed on manganites @xmath1@xmath2mno@xmath3 @xcite with pseudo - cubic perovskite structure and their related materials . here ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are trivalent and divalent cations , respectively .",
    "this is owing to the newly discovered colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr)@xcite : a huge decreasing of the electrical resistivity by applying a magnetic field . as well as cmr , a number of dramatic and fruitful phenomena in magnetic ,",
    "electric and optical properties has been reported .",
    "some of them can not be explained by the simple double exchange scenario @xcite and are ascribed to the strong interplay between spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom of an electron , as well as lattice @xcite .",
    "let us compare the electronic structure in cmr manganites with that in high tc cuprates . as well as cuprates ,",
    "manganites are known to be strongly correlated electron systems . in particular , the strong hund coupling is stressed for origin of the ferromagnetic metallic state .",
    "this is so - called the double exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "the electron configuration of a cu@xmath6 ion in la@xmath7cuo@xmath8 is @xmath9 and it is located at a center of a tetragonally distorted cuo@xmath10 octahedron . here , one hole occupies the @xmath11 orbital . on the other hand , four @xmath0 electrons in a mn@xmath12 ion form the high spin state , and",
    "the electrons occupy the three @xmath13 orbitals and one of the doubly degenerate @xmath14 orbitals as @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eg ] ) .",
    "therefore , this ion has a degree of freedom indicating which @xmath14 orbital is occupied by an electron .",
    "this is termed the orbital degree of freedom and is recognized as the third degree of freedom of an electron , in addition to the spin and charge ones .    in",
    "solid , the orbital degree of freedom often shows the long range ordering , termed the orbital ordering , which is caused by the inter - site interaction between orbitals .",
    "one of the examples is found in the parent compound of cmr manganites , lamno@xmath3 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals are alternately aligned in the @xmath18 plane below 780k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbilmo3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that this orbital ordering governs the anisotropic spin order termed the @xmath4-type antiferromagnetic ( af ) order where spins are ferromagnetically aligned in the @xmath18 plane and antiferromagnetically along the @xmath19 axis @xcite .",
    "another type of the orbital ordering appears in @xmath20mno@xmath3 where a nominal valence of a mn ion is 3.5 + @xcite . below a certain temperature , mn@xmath12 and mn@xmath21 ions",
    "spatially order and , in the mn@xmath12 sublattice , two kinds of orbital sublattice appear .",
    "the charge and orbital orderings occur at the same temperature and , at finally , the spin order termed the ce - type af order is realized .",
    "thus , all electronic degrees of freedom are frozen in the low temperature phase .",
    "since cmr appears at the vicinity of the charge and orbital ordering transition , it is recognized that the orbital plays a crucial role on cmr and other dramatic phenomena in manganites .",
    "theoretical study of the electronic orbital in 3@xmath22 electron systems is retrospective to more than 40 years ago .",
    "signs and magnitudes of the superexchange interactions have been studied in the systems with orbital degeneracy in 1950 s @xcite .",
    "the orbital degeneracy brings about the ferromagnetic interaction between same kinds of ions in the case where an angle of the bond connecting the nearest neighboring ( nn ) magnetic ions is 180@xmath23 . as well as the superexchange interaction between spins ,",
    "the virtual exchanges of electrons under the strong coulomb interactions induce the inter - site interactions between orbitals .",
    "being based on the theoretical models , where spin and orbital are treated on an equal footing , the mutual relations between spin and orbital orderings were investigated in several magnetic compounds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital ordering has been studied in connection with jahn - teller effects . in molecules ,",
    "a degeneracy of electronic orbitals is always lifted spontaneously by lowering symmetry of molecule except for chain - shaped molecules .",
    "this is the jahn - teller theorem @xcite . in solid",
    ", the virtual exchange of phonons brings about the inter - site interaction between orbitals and causes the orbital ordering associated with the structural phase transition .",
    "this is termed the cooperative jahn - teller effects @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of cmr , theoretical study of the orbital degree of freedom has been revived and , in particular , the following new points of researches are focused on : ( 1 ) dynamics of the orbital degree of freedom @xcite , ( 2 ) roles of the orbital on magnetic , transport and optical properties in metals @xcite , and ( 3 ) exotic orbital ordered states @xcite .",
    "actually , a variety of orbital states was proposed theoretically in manganites and other transition - metal oxides .",
    "however , direct comparisons of these predictions with experimental results have been limited up to recently , because the orbital degree of freedom does not couple directly to most of experimental probes .",
    "this is in contrast to the spin and charge degrees of freedom which are directly detected by the neutron and electron / x - ray diffraction techniques , respectively .    in 1998 ,",
    "murakami and coworkers applied the resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) method to one of the orbital ordered manganites la@xmath24sr@xmath25mno@xmath8 and successfully observed the orbital order @xcite .",
    "this technique has been rapidly developed and expanded to several compounds with orbital degree of freedom .",

    "apart from the micropcopic mechanisms of the anisotropy of asf , we introduce , in sec .  [",
    "sec : group ] , the general theoretical framework of rxs where the scattering cross section is directly related to the orbital degree of freedom .",
    "this is applied to study of the orbital ordering , fluctuation and excitations .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary .",
    "experimental observation of the orbital degree of freedom of an electron is , in general , a hard task , unlike spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom . as mentioned previously , in molecules ,",
    "a degeneracy of electronic orbitals is lifted by the jahn - teller effects .",
    "it may be expected that , also in solid , the orbital ordering always occurs by a crystal lattice distortion as known to be the cooperative jahn - teller effects .",
    "even when the orbital ordering is caused by other mechanisms , the crystal lattice may follow a shape of the electronic cloud by the electron - lattice interactions .",
    "thus , one may think that the orbital ordering can be observed through measuring the lattice distortion .",
    "however , this is not always true and one to one correspondence between orbital and lattice does not exist in solid .",
    "this is because there is an infinite number of degrees of freedom and several interactions acting on orbital and lattice compete and cooperate with each other .    in principle , the scattering intensities in the several diffraction experiments depend on the anisotropic shape of the electronic wave function and/or electronic charge distribution .",
    "however , since the orbital dependence of the scattering intensity is too small to be observed easily , precise experiments in a wide range of diffraction angles and detailed data analyses are required . as an example , let us consider the conventional x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "the peak intensity is proportional to the square of the electronic charge valence . on the other hand , a difference of the electronic orbital corresponds to a difference of the charge valence being less than a charge unit @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the orbital effects in the x - ray scattering intensity is usually smeared out by the scatterings from heavy ions , impurities , defects and so on . the first direct observation of the orbital ordered state was carried out by the polarized neutron diffraction method in k@xmath7cuf@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this technique is applicable to the observation of orbital ordering in magnetically ordered state where both the spin and orbital moments are ascribed to the same @xmath22 or @xmath27 electrons .",
    "the magnetic structure factors @xmath28 which include information of the electronic orbital are measured at several reflection points and are compared with the model calculations .",
    "this method was recently applied to the ferromagnetic ytio@xmath3 and revealed successfully the type of the orbital ordered state @xcite .",
    "another experimental observation of the orbital ordering was carried out by the charge density distribution study using the x - ray and/or electron diffraction technique .",
    "the charge density of a cu@xmath29 ion in cu@xmath7o was recently observed by utilizing the convergent - beam electron diffraction combined with x - ray diffraction @xcite . in general , x - ray scattering is sensitive to defects contained in a crystal and the scattering from defects is greater than the orbital dependent scattering .",
    "thus , a perfect region of a crystal is selected by the electron microscopy and the charge distribution map is obtained by the electron and x - ray diffraction data in a wide region of scattering angles .",
    "an electronic charge - distribution is also obtained by the combined method of the rietveld refinement of the x - ray powder diffraction data and the maximum entropy method ( mem ) . here , mem is utilized to construct a real space charge - distribution from the x - ray diffraction data by the fourier transformation .",
    "this method has been applied to the structural studies of several fullerene and silicides , @xcite and was recently applied to ndsr@xmath30mn@xmath7o@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the study of the resonant x - ray scattering and anisotropic character of the x - ray scattering have been developed in the research field of the crystarography more than twenty years ago .",
    "the anisotropies of absorption and reflection in the visible light regions , i.e. the linear dichroism and birefringence ( double reflection ) , are well known phenomena and useful to the study of the electronic structure in solid .",
    "however , in the x - ray region , these are usually small and the scattering factor is treated as a scalar with respect to the polarization of x ray .",
    "the observations of the polarization dependent x - ray absorption and double reflection have been done by templeton and templeton near the v @xmath32 edge in crystalline vo(c@xmath33h@xmath31o@xmath7)@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic feature was also observed in the diffraction experiments in sodium uranyl acetate , nauo@xmath7(o@xmath7cch@xmath3)@xmath3 , and was found to be dramatically enhanced when the incident x - ray energy is tuned around u @xmath34 edge @xcite .",
    "they have measured the polarization dependence of the diffraction intensity as a function of the x - ray energy and derived the tensor elements of the x - ray scattering factors .",
    "the crystal structure of this compound is cubic and does not exhibit dichroism and birefringence on a macroscopic scale .",
    "therefore , this is caused by a lack of the cubic symmetry around u ion which is located on threefold axes . with these works as a start , a number of experimental and theoretical studies about x - ray dichroism and birefringence have been performed @xcite . in particular , dmitrienko developed this issue theoretically from the view point of the forbidden reflection @xcite .",
    "he expressed the x - ray scattering factor by the anisotropic x - ray susceptibility tensor and derived new extinction rules being valid near the absorption edge .",
    "this reflection is termed the anisotropy of tensor of susceptibility ( ats ) reflection . in the microscopic point of view",
    ", these phenomena are attributed to the chemical bonding of the edge atom in an anisotropic chemical environment .",
    "this brings about the orientation of unoccupied electronic levels .      in 1998",
    ", the resonant x - ray scattering was first applied to study of the orbital ordering in one of the manganites la@xmath24sr@xmath25mno@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the formal valence of a mn ion in this compound is 3.5 + , that is , an average number of the @xmath14 electron is 0.5 per ion . before the rxs experiment ,",
    "an alternating charge ordering with a @xmath35 unit cell was suggested by the electron diffraction experiments below 270k @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetically ordered structure with a @xmath36 unit cell was observed below 110k @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath37-type af ordering associated with the charge ordering and has been already observed in manganites with pseudo - cubic perovskite structure .",
    "more than forty years ago , in order to explain the @xmath37-type af ordering observed in la@xmath24ca@xmath24mno@xmath3 , an alternate ordering of the chemical bonds between mn and o ions , termed the covalent - bond ordering , was proposed @xcite . through the systematic structural and magnetic studies by x - ray and neutron scatterings ,",
    "this idea was reinforced , and the ordering of @xmath14 orbital associated with distorted mno@xmath10 octahedra was supposed @xcite .",
    "therefore , it was expected in la@xmath24sr@xmath25mno@xmath8 that the similar multi - component ordering is realized , although there was no direct evidence of the orbital ordering .",
    "murakami and coworkers applied rxs to investigate charge and orbital orderings in la@xmath24sr@xmath25mno@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "they utilized the following characteristics in this compound and rxs technique : ( 1 ) the expected orbital ordering has a unit cell with @xmath38 which is distinct from the unit cells for the spin and charge orderings . a schematic picture of the charge and orbital ordered state is shown in fig .",

    "this is available to detect the asphericity of the electron density .",
    "( 3 ) a magnitude of asf in rxs is sensitive to a valence of ion . to detect the orbital ordering ,",
    "the incident x - ray energy was tuned near the mn @xmath32 edge of 6.552kev and the reflection at @xmath39 was chosen .",
    "this reflection corresponds to a unit cell of the orbital ordering and termed orbital superlattice reflection .",
    "the structure factor at this point is represented by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are asf s in mn@xmath12 with orbitals a and b , respectively . when all mn@xmath12 ions are equivalent , this reflection disappears due to the structure factor .",
    "this is the extinction rule in the x ray scattering .",
    "the experimental results of the incident x - ray energy dependence of the scattering intensity are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:214int ] .",
    "the scattering intensity resonantly appears near the @xmath32-absorption edge , that is , the extinction rule is broken near the edge .",
    "this forbidden reflection is not ascribed to the normal part of asf , unlike the well known case of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 reflections in ge due to the anharmonic lattice vibration , because of the following two reasons ; ( 1 ) the scattering intensity shows a resonant behavior near the absorption edge .",
    "( 2 ) the normal part of asf is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the normal part of asf in a mn@xmath12 ion with a(b ) orbital and @xmath47 is its charge distribution . because of the symmetry of the charge distribution as @xmath48 a difference of the normal part @xmath49 vanishes at @xmath50 .",
    "the measurement of the angular dependence around the scattering vector , termed the azimuthal angle dependence , was utilized to confirm that this scattering results from the anomalous part of asf .",
    "the x - ray polarization coming from the synchrotron light source is highly polarized , such as the @xmath51 polarization in this case .",
    "thus , the relative direction of electric vector to a sample is changed by rotating a sample around the scattering vector .",
    "the scattering due to the normal part of asf does not show this dependence , since the asf is scalar .",
    "the experimental results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:214az ] .",
    "the scattering intensity oscillates as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath52 ; the intensity becomes its maximum ( minimum ) at @xmath53 ( 180@xmath23 ) where the incident x - ray polarization is parallel to the @xmath18 plane ( @xmath19 axis ) of the sample .",
    "this dependence was fitted by a function @xmath54 derived from the phenomenological calculation assuming the orbital ordering . therefore , the forbidden reflections ascribed to the multiple scattering , such as the ranninger scattering , is ruled out .",
    "it was concluded that the observed reflection originates from the anisotropic character of the anomalous part of asf .",
    "the authors also measured the reflection at @xmath55 being proportional to the difference between asf s of mn@xmath12 and mn@xmath21 : @xmath56 with asf of mn@xmath21 @xmath57 and a constant @xmath19 .",
    "both the reflections at @xmath58 and @xmath55 appear around 200k and show almost identical temperature dependence as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:214temp ] .",
    "this implies that the charge and orbital order parameters couple with each other .",
    "after the first observation , this technique was applied to a parent compound of cmr manganites lamno@xmath3 @xcite . as introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , an alternate ordering of orbital with a @xmath59 unit cell is expected from the largely distorted mno@xmath10 octahedron and the @xmath4-type af ordering .",

    "the @xmath60-type azimuthal angle dependence was confirmed only at the experimental arrangement where the scattered x - ray polarization @xmath61 is @xmath62 . on the contrary",

    "<S> orbital degree of freedom of electrons and its interplay with spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom are one of the central issues in colossal magnetoresistive manganites . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital degree of freedom has until recently remained hidden , since it does not couple directly to most of experimental probes . </S>",
    "<S> development of synchrotron light sources has changed the situation ; by the resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) technique the orbital ordering has successfully been observed . in this article , we review progress in the recent studies of rxs in manganites . we start with a detailed review of the rxs experiments applied to the orbital ordered manganites and other correlated electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the scattering cross section of rxs where the tensor character of the atomic scattering factor ( asf ) with respect to the x - ray polarization is stressed . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic mechanisms of the anisotropic tensor character of asf is introduced and numerical results of asf and the scattering intensity are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal angle scan is a unique experimental method to identify rxs from the orbital degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> a theory of the azimuthal angle and polarization dependence of the rxs intensity is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results show good agreement with the experiments in manganites . apart from the microscopic description of asf , a theoretical framework of rxs to relate directly to the @xmath0 orbital is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering cross section is represented by the correlation function of the pseudo - spin operator for the orbital degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> a theory is extended to the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering and methods to observe excitations of the orbital degree of freedom are proposed . </S>"
