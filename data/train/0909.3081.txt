    "grand unified theories ( gut ) in the framework of supersymmetry have been investigated for decades . under the assumption of a minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the sm gauge couplings unify at approximately @xmath2 gev . at higher energies ,",
    "the known interactions might be described by a single simple gauge group . however , the choice of the unified gauge group is not unique and potentially interferes with the low - energy theory , as shall be illustrated in the following .    throughout this note ,",
    "we assume a gut with the rank 6 exceptional lie - group @xmath0 as gauge group . decomposing the @xmath1 dimensional fundamental representation under its sm subgroup",
    ", one observes that the @xmath1 contains , in addition to one full generation of sm quarks and leptons , a right - handed neutrino as well as a full mssm higgs - sector , augmented by a sm singlet @xmath3 as in the nmssm .",
    "furthermore there is a pair of exotic particles @xmath4 that may couple quarks to leptons and shall be denoted as leptoquarks .    without the introduction of a further mechanism to render the exotic particle heavy at the @xmath0-breaking scale , the full particle content remains in the spectrum down to the tev - scale @xcite .",
    "the extra matter changes the renormalization group equations and hence the running of the couplings : simple unification of all three sm couplings as in the mssm is spoiled .",
    "as proposed in @xcite and furtherly investigated in @xcite , unification to a simple gauge group can be achieved by introducing an intermediate semi - simple gauge group , namely a pati - salam symmetry @xcite : @xmath5 \\label{ps - group}\\ ] ] in this regime there are only two independent couplings left to intersect , as @xmath6 and @xmath7 have identical particle content .    a suitable breaking of the intermediate gauge symmetry ( [ ps - group ] ) to the sm gauge group",
    "is achieved by introducing some higgs fields @xmath8 that transform as @xmath9 under @xmath0 and aquire a vev in the direction of the right - handed neutrino .",
    "this generates majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos , arising from the effective operator @xmath10 which trigger a see - saw mechanism to account for naturally small neutrino masses .",
    "the sm hypercharge group becomes a linear combination of the cartan generators @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 group is just the evident subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "finally , @xmath16 corresponds to the unbroken linear combination of @xmath17 and @xmath18 orthogonal to @xmath19 at the scale where the ps - group is broken down to the sm .",
    "yields non - rational charges @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the rge evolution of the two @xmath21 couplings introduces a non - trivial mixing among these groups , which can be taken into account by redefining @xmath20 . ]",
    "the full unification scenario is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the superpotential is obtained from decomposing an @xmath0-symmetric superpotential @xmath22 , omitting the terms involving the right handed neutrinos as well as the baryon - number violating interactions of the exotic particles @xmath4 : @xmath23 a priori , all yukawa couplings are rank three tensors in family space .",
    "however , in order to avoid flavor changing neutral currents , we introduce a so - called h - parity @xcite , that only allows one higgs generation to acquire a vev and couple to matter .",
    "this parity renders the lightest `` un - higgs '' stable and hence introduces a possible additional type of dark matter .    as in most susy models ( in fact all bsm models without a theory about flavor ) , the model contains a huge number of free parameters in the ssb sector . assuming the trilinear soft couplings to be proportional to the corresponding yukawas , the latter to be diagonal and neglecting complex phases , we arrive at a set of 16 parameters ( see table [ tab_params ] ) .",
    "three of those are be fixed by the minimization of the higgs - potential . from this parameter set ,",
    "a code generates a spectrum by solving the rges , minimizing the higgs potential and iterating in the dependent parameters . throughout a run , it checks for perturbativity of the theory up to the unification scale and negative scalar mass - squares . in the end",
    ", the spectrum is compared to the current direct experimental bounds .",
    "this algorithm is integrated into a monte - carlo markov - chain ( mcmc ) , in order to efficiently scan the high - dimensional parameter space . using this method",
    ", we hope to find a somewhat representative set of scenarios to characterize the phenomenology of this model .",
    "general phenomenological features of this model are : a more or less hierarchical structure of leptoquarks in the range from 500 gev to several tev as their masses @xmath24 are proportional to the singlet vev .",
    "this has to be big enough ( which comes more or less for free on the other hand , driven by a possibly large leptoquark singlet yukawa coupling ) in order to have a @xmath25 above the current tevatron limits and electroweak precision data limits .",
    "for the very same reason , the so - called un - higgses ( two of the three cp - even ) , the charged as well as the cp - odd higgses are rather heavy , i.e. @xmath26 tev .",
    "in contrast , the lightest higgs boson runs quite often in the nmssm parameter channel where it can be as light as @xmath27 gev in some regions of the parameter space . as in the nmssm ,",
    "the decays via the lightest pseudoscalars into four @xmath28 jets which already excluded discovery at lep , render a discovery at lhc very intricate .",
    "another very distinct feature is a rather light gluino not much heavier than weak inos , because the qcd beta function vanishes at first order .",
    "drawing a completely general conclusion from sparse scans through such a high - dimensional parameter space is difficult , so we shall concentrate in the following on a sample scenario , obtained by the mcmc and discuss some phenomenological features in a little more detail .",
    "[ tab : spec_pt ] shows on the left a sample spectrum , for which the leptoquark states are rather light , order 600 gev .",
    "the lightest higgs has a mass around 110 gev , whereas the remaining two higgs particles are heavier are far in the decoupling limit at 1 tev or more .",
    "the @xmath29 mass lies at order 2 tev , such that should also be discovered at an early stage of the lhc .",
    "but the really spectacular feature are the light leptoquarks , which yield cross section in the picobarn range . with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath30 , around",
    "100,000 signal events could be collected in the area of parameter space presented here .",
    "this would allow a spectroscopy of the leptoquark sector , and maybe even a determination of the yukawa couplings .",
    "we implemented this pati - salam symmetric supersymmetric standard model ( psssm ) into the multi - purpose event generator whizard  @xcite , which has been designed especially for bsm analyses , and many susy phenomenology projects have been performed  @xcite .",
    "here , we followed basically the conventions in  @xcite .",
    "as a prime example for the lhc phenomenology of this model we show here the @xmath31 distribution of single leptoquark production in that model .",
    "the chosen parameter point yields a spectacular signal - to - background ratio of 127 .    in summary",
    ", we analyzed both the high - dimensional parameter space of the psssm and its lhc phenomenology , which might give striking signals already at an early lhc stage .",
    "more phenomenology has been studied here  @xcite .     left : spectrum correponding to the input parameters from tab .",
