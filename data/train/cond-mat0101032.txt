    "in this paper , we are trying to study the nature of zero temperature quantum phase transition from d - wave superconductor at @xmath3 to the underdoped regime at @xmath4 of the high temperature superconductors ( fig.1 ) .     the temperature ( t ) versus doping ( @xmath5 ) diagram of high @xmath6 cuprates .",
    "it is well known that inside the superconductor phase @xmath7 , there are low energy quasi - particle excitations near the four nodes of the fermi surface , the quantum phase fluctuation of the cooper pair condensates are suppressed , the positive and negative vortices are bound together .",
    "as the doping decreases from the right to @xmath8 , the phase fluctuation increases . at the underdoped regime @xmath4 ,",
    "the quantum phase fluctuations are so strong that they generate free @xmath9 vortices , destroy the long range phase coherence of the d - wave superconductor , therefore the superconducting ground state .",
    "however , the local short - range pairing still exists , the low energy quasi - particles at the four nodes remain .",
    "this quantum phase transition is driven by the condensation of @xmath9 vortices . near the transition , there are strong coupling between the quasi - particles and the phase windings of @xmath9 vortices .",
    "a lot of work has been done on a closely related problem where quasi - particles are coupled to the vortices generated by external magnetic field inside the superconducting state @xcite . in the following , we will first review these work , then will extend the methods developed in these work to study this quantum phase transition where the quasi - particles are coupled to the quantum fluctuation generated vortices .    employing semi - classical approximation ,",
    "volovik pointed out that the circulating supercurrents around vortices induce doppler energy shift to the quasi - particle spectrum , which leads to a finite density of states at the nodes @xcite .",
    "this effect ( volovik effect ) has been employed to attempt to explain the experimental observations @xcite of longitudinal thermal conductivity @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "starting from bcs hamiltonian , anderson @xcite employed the first single - valued singular gauge transformation to study quasi - particle dynamics in the mixed state .",
    "unfortunately , anderson made an incorrect mean field approximation which violates the `` time - reversal '' symmetry @xcite , therefore leads to the incorrect conclusion that there is landau level quantization of energy levels of the quasi - particle .",
    "franz and tesanovic ( ft ) employed a different single - valued singular gauge transformation to map the quasi - particle in a square vortex lattice state to dirac fermion moving in an effective periodic scalar and vector potential with _",
    "zero _ average and studied the quasi - particle spectrum numerically @xcite .",
    "they did not see the signature of landau level quantization in their numerical calculations    unfortunately , in the vortex lattice state , the vector potential only provides a periodic potential instead of scattering quasi - particles , its effect on the energy spectrum and other physical quantities is not evident .",
    "this motivated ye to study the quasi - particle transport in the disordered vortex state where the random ab phase scattering may show its important effects .",
    "in ref.@xcite , ye observed that because infinite thin @xmath11 vortices do _ not _ break the t reversal symmetry , any correct mean field theory should respect this t symmetry .",
    "he showed exactly there is no landau level quantization due to this t symmetry .",
    "he applied the singular transformation in the ft gauge to _ disordered _ vortex state and found that the long - range logarithmic interaction between vortices suppresses the fluctuation of superfluid velocity ( scalar potential ) , but does _ not _ affect the fluctuation of the internal gauge field . therefore the scalar field acquires a `` mass '' determined by the vortex density , but the gauge field remains `` massless '' .",
    "the quasi - particle scattering from the `` massless '' internal gauge field dominates over those from the well - known `` massive '' volovik effect and the non - magnetic scattering at sufficient high magnetic field .",
    "this dominant scattering mechanism is a purely quantum mechanical effects which was completely missed by all the previous semi - classical treatments @xcite .",
    "it is responsible for the behaviors of both @xmath10 and @xmath12 in high magnetic field observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "when the vortices are generated by quantum fluctuations or thermal fluctuations , themselves are moving around , new physics may arise . from newton",
    "s third law , intuitively , the vortices must also feel the counter - acting ab phase coming from the quasi - particles .",
    "therefore there is a mutual ab phase scattering between vortices and quasi - particles . in this paper",
    ", we enlarge the _",
    "one _ singular gauge transformation developed in @xcite to _ two _ mutual flux - attaching singular gauge transformations .",
    "we then apply them to study quasi - particles coupled to moving vortices near the zero temperature quantum critical point .",
    "in canonical quantization , we perform two singular transformations which are dual to each other to quasi - particles and moving vortices respectively .",
    "just like conventional singular gauge transformation leads to conventional chern - simon ( cs ) term , the two mutual singular gauge transformations lead to mutual cs term .",
    "this elegant mutual cs term precisely describe the mutual ab phase scattering between vortices and quasi - particles .",
    "alternatively , in path - integral presentation , the effective action describes the quasi - particle moving in both vector and scalar potentials due to the phase fluctuations of quantum generated vortices . by a duality transformation presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to a vortex representation , the quantum fluctuation generated vortices couple to quasi - particles by a mutual cs term , the vortices are also interacting with each other by long range logarithmic interactions due to charge fluctuation described by a maxwell term . by carefully considering the periodicity of this mutual cs term , it can be shown that the effective action is essentially equivalent to the dual vortex representation derived by senthil and fisher ( sf ) from the elegant @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite except the volovik effect missing in the @xmath2 gauge theory is also explicitly incorporated into the present approach . neglecting the charge fluctuation first and replacing the @xmath2 mutual cs theory by the @xmath13 mutual cs theory , we find a fixed line characterized by the mutual statistical angle @xmath0 and calculate the universal spinon , vortex and mutual hall drag conductivities which continuously depend on @xmath0 . this transition can also be viewed as a simplest confinement and deconfinement transition .",
    "the properties of the confinement and deconfinement phases on the two sides of the critical point are also discussed .",
    "we stressed explicitly that the periodicity of @xmath2 mutual cs gauge theory on the lattice is _ not _ preserved by the @xmath13 mutual cs theory in the continuum . when the @xmath13 charge fluctuation is taken into account",
    ", we tentatively still replace the @xmath2 mutual cs theory by the @xmath13 cs mutual theory and treat both @xmath13 fluctuations on the same footing .",
    "we find the @xmath13 charge fluctuation turns the fixed line into a fixed point where charge @xmath14 and spin 1/2 dirac - like quasi - particle and charge @xmath15 cooper pairs are asymptotically decoupled .",
    "although the result is pathological , it does suggest the spinon and holon are confined into electrons and cooper pairs when condensing @xmath9 vortices , in contrast to the condensing of double strength @xmath16 vortices discussed in @xcite and reviewed in appendix c. although we are unable to solve the critical behaviors of a combined @xmath2 and @xmath13 theory in this paper , we do stress that @xmath2 periodicity should be treated correctly to understand the critical behaviors of a theory with both discrete @xmath2 and continuous @xmath13 gauge fields .",
    "the paper is organized as the following . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the effective action with both the mutual c - s interaction and the charge fluctuation , first in the path integral language , and then in canonical quantization representation . in sec .",
    "iii , we concentrate on the effect of the mutual c - s interaction and calculate the critical exponents and universal conductivities for general statistical angle @xmath0",
    ". implications for double layers quantum hall system are given .",
    "some details are relegated to appendix a. in appendix c , we concentrate on the effect of charge fluctuation which is the only gauge fluctuation in double strength @xmath16 vortices . in sec iv , we discuss the combined effect of mutual c - s interaction and charge fluctuation , we also stress the importance to keep the periodicity of @xmath2 gauge field when considering a theory with both discrete @xmath2 and continuous @xmath13 gauge fields . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the connection of our approach to the current fashion @xmath2 gauge theory and point out the possible open problems . in appendix",
    "b , we apply the method developed in the main text to quenched random vortex array .",
    "following the notation in refs.@xcite , we define @xmath17 @xcite . because there are equal number of positive and negative vortices ,",
    "we divide the positive vortices into two subsets @xmath18 and negative vortices into two subsets @xmath19 .",
    "we define @xmath20 and introduce the spinon by performing a general singular unitary transformation @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the phase of the cooper pair .",
    "the original transformation @xcite is devised for static vortices . here",
    "we extend it to moving vortices whose phase @xmath24 is also fluctuating , therefore , depends on both the space and time .",
    "the spinon is charge neutral . in anderson s",
    "gauge , @xmath25 or vice versa . in the former(latter ) , the spinon is electron - like ( hole - like ) .    expanding @xmath26 around the node 1 where @xmath27 , we obtain the linearized quasi - particle lagrangian @xmath28 in the presence of the external gauge potential @xmath29 : @xmath30      \\psi_{1 }     \\nonumber    \\\\    & + & \\psi^{\\dagger}_{1 } \\psi_{1 } v_{f } v_{x}(\\vec{r } )       + i \\psi^{\\dagger}_{1 } \\tau^{3 } \\psi_{1 } v_{\\tau}(\\vec{r } )       + ( 1 \\rightarrow 2 , x \\rightarrow y ) \\label{linear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the gauge - invariant superfluid _ momentum _ , it acts as a scalar scattering potential , @xmath32 is the ab gauge field due to the phase winding of vortices @xcite .",
    "note that the external gauge potential only appear explicitly in the superfluid momentum @xmath33 .",
    "because there are equal number of positive and negative vortices in both @xmath34 and @xmath35 , on the average , the vanishing of @xmath33 and @xmath36 is automatically ensured , in this case , the anderson gauge turns out to be more convenient than ft gauge . in the following , we use the electron - like anderson gauge where @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "as intended , the above eq .",
    "is explicitly @xmath44 spin invariant .",
    "equivalently , we can start with the explicitly spin @xmath44 invariant approach advocated in ref.@xcite and perform the singular gauge transformation in the _ p - h _ space .",
    "@xmath28 enjoys gauge symmetry @xmath50 ( in fact , it is @xmath51 ) , the first being uniform and second being staggered gauge symmetry : @xmath52 under this uniform @xmath13 transformation , the corresponding fields transform as : @xmath53    @xmath54 all are invariant under this external @xmath13 transformation .",

    "it is easy to realize that @xmath60 acts only on the boson sector , since the spinon is charge neutral , @xmath61 acts only on the fermion sector .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 should be a discrete local @xmath2 symmetry @xcite , because up and down @xmath9 vortices are equivalent and do not break t symmetry @xcite .",
    "the phase fluctuation is simply @xmath62 dimensional x - y model : @xmath63    after absorbing the scalar potential scattering part ( volovik term ) into @xmath64 , we can write the total lagrangian @xmath65 as : @xmath66      \\psi_{1a }     \\nonumber    \\\\      & + &   ( 1 \\rightarrow 2 , x \\rightarrow y )        + \\frac{k}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\phi - a^{eff}_{\\mu } ) ^{2 } \\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and the quasi - particle electric current is : @xmath68 .    from eq.[act ] , it is easy to identify the two conserved noether currents : spinon current and electric current .",
    "the spinon current is given by : @xmath69    obviously the spinon current only comes from quasi - particle . in principle",
    ", the spinon current is not conserved due to scatterings between different nodes which lead to anomalous terms not included in eq.[act ] .",
    "however , the inter - node scatterings involve large momenta transfer @xmath70 for @xmath71 , so we neglect them due to momentum conservation in the long wave - length limit of the phase fluctuation @xcite .",
    "the exact conserved _ spin current _",
    "@xmath72 is with @xmath73 inserted in the above spinon currents .",
    "the electric current is given by : @xmath74 where the first part coming from cooper pair and the second from the quasi - particle .",
    "although they are not separately conserved , their sum is .",
    "the noether current due to the the symmetry under @xmath75 can be written as : @xmath76    it is a combination of electric and spinon currents , therefore also conserved .",
    "following refs.@xcite , we perform a duality transformation to eq.[act ] @xmath77 where we have separated topological trivial spin - wave part and topological non - trivial vortex parts .    integrating out the spin - wave part",
    ", we get the conservation equation for the total current @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , as shown in the previous paragraphs , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are separately conserved .",
    "therefore we can introduce spin and electric gauge fields by : @xmath81    we can also define the vortex current : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the vortex gauge field .    substituting the above expressions into eq.[boson ] , we reach : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the total gauge field felt by the moving vortices .    using @xmath86 for the vortex operator and adding the quasi - particle part , we get the following effective action : @xmath87      \\psi_{1 }    \\nonumber   \\\\         &   + &   ( 1 \\rightarrow 2 , x \\rightarrow y )                           \\nonumber   \\\\    & + & | ( \\partial_{\\mu } -i a^{\\phi}_{\\mu}-i a_{\\mu } ) \\phi |^{2 }        + v ( |\\phi| ) + \\frac{i } { 2 \\pi \\theta } a^{\\psi}_{\\mu }       \\epsilon_{\\mu \\nu \\lambda } \\partial_{\\nu } a^{\\phi}_{\\lambda }                          \\nonumber   \\\\    & + & \\frac{1 } { 4 } f^{2 } _ { \\mu \\nu }      -i a^{eff}_{\\mu } \\epsilon_{\\mu \\nu \\lambda } \\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\lambda }      - \\mu \\epsilon_{ij } \\partial_{i } a_{j } \\label{dual}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 stands for the short range interaction between the vortices .",
    "the last term is due to berry phase in the boson representation @xcite which can be absorbed into @xmath89 by redefining @xmath90 , it acts like an external magnetic field in the @xmath91 ( namely @xmath92 ) direction .",
    "there are one species of vortex and @xmath93 species of dirac fermion ( 2 spin components at 2 nodes at the upper plane ) , the mutual statistical angle @xmath1 .",
    "we also changed the notation by setting @xmath94 .",
    "although we derived the above equation in the electron - like anderson gauge , in fact , it holds in _ any _ gauge .",
    "eq.[dual ] again enjoys the gauge symmetry @xmath95 , the first only acting on the vortex sector is the electric @xmath13 gauge field , the second on both the vortex and fermion sectors is the @xmath13 mutual cs gauge field .",
    "the mutual chern - simon term enforces the constraints : @xmath96 .",
    "physically , it means that when a quasi - particle encircles a vortex , it picks up a phase @xmath97 .",

    "for example , @xmath100 is equivalent to @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , this mutual cs term at @xmath101 should be the same as the @xmath2 mutual cs term on the lattice discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore strictly speaking @xmath102 and @xmath103 are @xmath2 gauge fields , only @xmath36 is a @xmath13 gauge field . the doppler - shifted term ( volovik effect ) is encoded in the last term in eq.[dual ] .",
    "this effect was _ not _ taken into account in the @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "in canonical quantization language , it is very instructive to compare the well - known singular gauge transformation leading to composite fermion in @xmath104 system by halperin , lee and read ( hlr ) @xcite to the singular gauge transformations performed in the spinon - vortex system in this paper .",
    "the crucial difference is that in the former , we attach electron s own @xmath0 flux to itself ( @xmath105 in @xmath104 system to keep fermion statistics intact ) , the constraint @xmath106 in coulomb gauge @xmath107 leads to composite fermion @xmath108 coupled to conventional cs term which breaks t symmetry , has periodicity under @xmath98 ; however , in the latter , we attach vortex s @xmath101 flux to quasi - particle or _ vise versa _ , the two constraints @xmath109 in coulomb gauges @xmath110 naturally leads to quasi - particles and vortices are coupled by mutual cs term in additional to the electrical gauge field which mediates the logarithmic interaction between vortices .",
    "the mutual cs term does not break t symmetry , has periodicity under @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to point out that when a vortex is moving around a closed loop , it pick up two phases , one is @xmath2 phase due to the spinon current , described by the mutual c - s term , another is @xmath13 phase due to the total electric charge current described by the maxwell term . in the following section",
    ", we will neglect the electric charge fluctuation and concentrate the mutual statistics term . in sec .",
    "iv , we will study the effect of charge fluctuation described by the maxwell term .",
    "for completeness , we relegate the review of the effect of charge fluctuation to appendix b.    for simplicity , we take the relativistic form for both fermion and boson , because the anisotropies in eq.[dual ] are expected to be irrelevant near the zero temperature qcp @xcite .",

    "all the generated terms only renormalize the short range interactions already included in @xmath117 .",
    "the model is also closely related to the hall drag problem in double layer quantum hall system @xcite , therefore the model itself is interesting on its own right and deserves detailed investigation .      in order to calculate conductivities , we add two source fields @xmath118 and @xmath119 for the quasi - particles and vortex respectively :    @xmath120    where @xmath121 stands for @xmath93 species of dirac fermion .",
    "in fact , two maxwell terms for @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be added to the above equation , but they are subleading to the mutual cs term in the low energy limit .",
    "it is expected that there is no periodicity under @xmath99 in the continuum limit .",
    "if the theory is properly regularized on the lattice , it should has the periodicity under @xmath99 , for example , @xmath122 should be equivalent to @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , @xmath124 mutual @xmath13 cs theory could be the same as the @xmath2 mutual cs theory developed in @xcite .",

    "however they are evident in the dual vortex representation eq.[mutual ] .",

    "the dirac fermions become free . in fact , we reach the same description from the boson representation eq.[mutualb ] . because in superconductor phase , the boson @xmath24 condense , therefore generates a mass term @xmath185 which renders the maxwell term ineffective .",
    "we reach the same conclusion from both sides by identifying @xmath186 .    in short , in the disordered phase ,",
    "the system is described by spinor qed eq.[qed ] ; in the superconductor side , by free dirac fermion .",
    "we can view the transition as the simplest confinement - deconfinement transition . in the confined ( disordered ) phase",
    ", the boson and fermion are confined together by the fluctuating gauge field . in the deconfined",
    "( superconductor ) phase , the boson condensed , the fermion becomes free .",
    "there is a line of fixed point governed by the mutual statistical angle @xmath0 separating the two phases .",

    "although the replacement leads to somewhat misleading conclusions , the heuristics derivation suggests that the condensation of @xmath9 vortex condensation indeed leads to the confinement of spinon and chargon into cooper pair and electron , in contrast to the condensation of @xmath16 vortex .",
    "we do not intend to understand the critical behaviors of a combined @xmath2 and @xmath13 theory in this paper .",
    "we simply stress that @xmath2 periodicity should be treated correctly to understand the critical behaviors of a theory with both discrete @xmath2 and continuous @xmath13 gauge fields .      putting @xmath187 in eq.[dual ] , we get @xmath188    integrating out the electric gauge field @xmath36 leads to : @xmath189    comparing to eq.[mutual ] , it is easy to see that the charge fluctuation leads to a mass term for the gauge field @xmath178 . shifting @xmath190 and adding the gauge fixing term @xmath191 , we can integrate out the _ massive _ gauge field @xmath36 in lorenz gauge @xmath192 and find : @xmath193    note the maxwell term for @xmath103 is generated by the integration over the massive @xmath36 .",
    "setting @xmath194 , integrating out the fermions only leads to higher derivative terms than the maxwell term : @xmath195 where @xmath196 means higher than second order derivatives . therefore the vortex and fermion are asymptotically decoupled .",
    "it indicates that the charge fluctuation neglected in the last section destroy the fixed line characterized by @xmath0 .",
    "however , very different conclusions are reached in ref.@xcite .",
    "we believe that the authors failed to treat the charge gauge field fluctuation correctly .    just like the last section , it is instructive to go to dual representation of eq.[vortexm ] , namely go to the boson representation : @xmath197    integrating out @xmath140 leads to the _ same _ constraint as eq.[cons ] up to a pure gauge : @xmath198    substituting the above constraint to eq.[charged ] and setting @xmath172 , we find : @xmath199    comparing to eq.[mutualb ] , the only difference is that the gauge field acquires a mass due to the charge fluctuation which renders the maxwell term ineffective .",
    "up to irrelevant couplings , we can safely set @xmath200 in the above equation and find @xmath201 where @xmath196 means the irrelevant couplings between bosons and fermions .",
    "the above eq .",
    "leads to in - consistent conclusion that the original charge neutral spinon @xmath202 becomes charged : carrying charge @xmath203 for @xmath101 and @xmath204 for @xmath100 .",
    "therefore we also reach ambiguous conclusions for @xmath205 and @xmath100 .",
    "the reason is that we replace the @xmath2 cs gauge theory on the lattice which explicitly respects the equivalence between @xmath101 and @xmath206 by the @xmath13 cs theory which does not respect this equivalence in the continuum limit .",
    "identifying @xmath178 which is a discrete @xmath2 gauge field with @xmath29 which is a @xmath13 gauge field is a direct consequence of this problematic replacement .",
    "we follow the discussions in the previous section . in the disordered phase ,",

    "diagonizing the last two mass terms leads to a _ continuously changing charge _ .",

    "again , the pathological claims are due to the artifact of replacing the @xmath2 mutual statistical gauge theory by a @xmath13 mutual cs theory , then treating @xmath2 gauge field and @xmath13 electrical gauge field on the same footing .",
    "although all these results are the artifacts of this replacement , they do suggest that the mutual statistical interaction between @xmath9 vortex and spinons leads to the confinement of spinon and chargon into electron and cooper pair .",
    "the original singular gauge transformation @xcite was proposed for static vortices . in this paper , we extend the singular gauge transformation to moving vortices generated by quantum fluctuation . by making a close analogy to the conventional singular gauge transformation of fqh system , we perform singular gauge transformations attaching flux of moving vortices to quasi - particles or vice versa . just like conventional singular gauge transformation leads to conventional cs term ,",
    "the two mutual singular gauge transformations lead to mutual cs term . in this way",

    "that of @xmath2 gauge theory , the action is mapped into a dual vortex representation where the @xmath9 vortices and spinons are coupled by a mutual @xmath2 cs gauge theory . as usual vortices in xy model ,",
    "the @xmath9 vortices also couple to a fluctuating @xmath13 gauge field which mediates the long - range logarithmic interaction between the vortices .",
    "starting from the dual representation , the authors in ref.@xcite studied a transition from d - wave superconductor to confined mott insulator driven by the condensing of @xmath9 vortices . in order to study the critical behaviors of this particular confinement and de - confinement transition , they replaced the @xmath2 mutual cs theory on the lattice by @xmath13 mutual cs theory in the continuum and performed renormalization group ( rg ) analysis .",
    "unfortunately , some of their rg analysis are incorrect as demonstrated in sec.iv .",
    "it was shown in the text that our resulting general effective action eq.[dual ] at the two special statistical angles @xmath162 is essentially equivalent to the dual vortex representation of @xmath2 gauge theory developed by sf , except it also bring out explicitly the volovik effect which was _ missed _ in sf s @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "as explicitly stressed in this paper , the @xmath13 mutual cs theory in the continuum does not have the required periodicity under @xmath99 . in order to preserve this periodicity when the mutual statistical angle takes special values @xmath214 , a @xmath2 mutual cs theory must be enforced on the lattice .",
    "again , two ways of regularization may lead to different conclusions .",
    "in fact , the periodicity of the conventional cs theory under @xmath215 is also a very intricate issue . on the one hand ,",
    "the perturbative rg expansion in terms of the statistical angle @xmath0 in the continuum limit in refs.@xcite does not have this periodicity . on the other hand , properly regularized on the lattice",
    ", the cs theory does have this periodicity @xcite .",
    "the two different regularization do lead to different conclusions on the quantum hall transitions .",
    "it also leads to notorious hall conductivity difficulty at @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "although we are unable to solve the critical behaviors of this combined @xmath2 and @xmath13 gauge fields coupled to spinons and @xmath9 vortices , we stressed the importance of putting the theory on the lattices to keep the periodicity of @xmath2 mutual cs term and shed considerable lights on the physical picture and structure of the quantum transitions driven by @xmath9 vortices .",
    "we suggest that it may be possible to trace out the @xmath2 gauge fluctuation on the lattice first to get an effective action without the discrete gauge fields , then take continuum limit of it and perform rg calculation .",
