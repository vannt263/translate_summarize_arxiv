    "student resistance to the evaluation of  @xmath0 as the real number  @xmath1 ( henceforth referred to as the _ unital evaluation _ ) has been widely discussed in the mathematics education literature .",
    "it has been suggested that the source of such resistance lies in a psychological predisposition in favor of thinking of  @xmath0 as a process , or iterated procedure , rather than the final outcome , see for instance d.  tall s papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite for another approach ) .",
    "we propose an alternative model to explain such resistance , in the framework of non - standard analysis . from this point of view",
    ", the resistance is directed against an unspoken and unacknowledged application of the standard part function `` st '' ( see section  [ ten ] , item [ 103 ] ) , namely the stripping away of a ghost of an infinitesimal , to echo george berkeley  @xcite , implicit in unital evaluation :    @xmath5{9tail.ps}}}\\end{pmatrix } = 1.\\ ] ]    what is the significance of such fine ( indeed , infinitesimal ) districtions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ? as this text is addressed to a wide audience , it may be worth recalling that _ dividing _ by the difference @xmath6 will only be possible if the latter is nonzero , a matter of immediate import for studying rates of change and calculating derivatives ( see section  [ zoom ] ) .",
    "the hyperreal approach to a certain extent vindicates the student resistance to education professionals toeing the standard line on unital evaluation : so long as the number system has not been specified , the students hunch that @xmath0 can fall infinitesimally short of @xmath1 , can be justified in a mathematically rigorous fashion .    in section  [ two ] ,",
    "based on a formula for a geometric sum , we summarize the standard argument in favor of unital evaluation . in section  [ three ] , we summarize the standard resistance to the latter . in section  [ four ] , we construct a hyperreal decimal in @xmath7 , represented by a string of @xmath4-infinitely many repeated 9s , and identify its lightstone representation . in section  [ five ] , we square the strict inequality with standard reality , by means of the standard part function . in section",
    "[ six ] , we represent the hyperreal graphically by means of an infinite - magnification microscope , already exploited for pedagogical purposes by keisler @xcite and tall @xcite . in section  [ zoom ] , we exploit the hyperreal to calculate @xmath8 .    in section",
    "[ eight ] , we develop an applied - mathematical model of a hypercalculator so as to explain a familiar phenomenon of a calculator returning a string of 9s in place of an integer . in section",
    "[ nine ] , we examine the cognitive concept of _ generic limit _ of cornu and tall in mathematics education , in relation to a hyperreal approach to limits . in section",

    "the historical section  [ history ] contains an examination of the views of courant , lakatos , and e. bishop .",
    "section  [ proposal ] contains a 10-step proposal concerning the problem of unital evaluation .",
    "evaluating the formula @xmath9 at  @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath11 or alternatively    @xmath12    multiplying by  @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 for every  @xmath15 . as  @xmath16 increases without bound , the formula @xmath17 becomes @xmath18 or does it ?",
    "when i tried this one on my teenage daughter , she remained unconvinced . she felt that the number  @xmath0 is smaller than  @xmath1 .",
    "after all , just look at it !",
    "there is something missing before you reach  @xmath1 .",
    "i then proceeded to give a number of arguments .",
    "apologetic mumbo - jumbo about the alleged `` non - unicity of decimal representation '' fell on deaf ears .",
    "the one that seemed to work best was the following variety of the old - fashioned `` because i told you so '' argument : factor out a  @xmath19 : @xmath20 to obtain @xmath21 and `` everybody knows '' that the number  @xmath22 is exactly `` a third '' _ on the nose_. q.e.d .",
    "this worked for a few minutes , but then the validity of was called into question , as well .",
    "then i finally broke down . in abraham robinson s theory of hyperreal analysis @xcite , there is a notion of an infinite hyperinteger ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 108 ] ) .",
    "h.  jerome keisler @xcite took to denoting such an entity by the symbol @xmath23 possibly because its inverse is an infinitesimal  @xmath24 typically appearing in the denominator of the familiar definition of derivative ( it most decidedly does _ not _ stand for `` howard '' ) .",
    "taking infinitely many terms in formula is interpreted as replacing  @xmath15 by an infinite hyperinteger @xmath25 the transfer principle ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 101 ] ) applied to then yields @xmath26 where the infinitesimal quantity  @xmath27 is nonzero : @xmath28 therefore we obtain the strict nonstandard inequality @xmath29 and my teenager was right all along .",
    "note that hyperreal extended decimal expansions were treated by a. lightstone in @xcite . in his notation , the hyperreal appearing in the left - hand - side of   appears as the extended decimal @xmath30 with the hat `` @xmath31 '' indicating the  @xmath4-th decimal place , where the _ last _ repeated digit  @xmath3 occurs .",
    "we have employed the underbrace notation as in rather than lightstone s semicolon , as it parallels the finite case more closely , and seems more intuitive .",
    "an alternative construction of a strict inequality @xmath32 may be found in @xcite , however in a number system which is not a field .",
    "to obtain a real number in place of the hyperreal @xmath34 , we apply the standard part function `` @xmath35 '' ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 103 ] ) : @xmath36 to elaborate further , one could make the following remark . even in standard analysis ,",
    "the expression  @xmath0 is only shorthand for the * limit * of the finite expression when the standard integer  @xmath16 increases without bound . from the hyperreal viewpoint , `` taking the limit '' is accomplished in two steps :    1 .",
    "evaluating the expression at an infinite hyperinteger  @xmath4 , and then 2 .   taking the standard part .",
    "the two steps form the non - standard definition of limit ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 1010 ] ) . now",
    "the first step ( evaluating at  @xmath4 ) produces a hyperreal number dependent on  @xmath4 ( in all cases it will be strictly less than  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the second step will strip away the infinitesimal part and produce the standard real number  @xmath1 in the _ cluster _ ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 104 ] ) of points infinitely close to it .",
    "[ 51b ] the existence of more than one infinite hyperreal is not only a requirement to have a field , but is actually extremely useful . for example , using the natural hypperreal extension  @xmath37 of  @xmath38 ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 101 ] ) , it is possible to write down a pointwise definition of uniform continuity of a function  @xmath38 ( see below ) .",
    "such a definition considerably reduces the quantifier complexity of the standard definition .    to elaborate ,",
    "note that the standard definition of uniform continuity of a real function  @xmath38 can be said to be _ global _ rather than _ local _",
    "( i.e. pointwise ) , in the sense that , unlike ordinary continuity , uniform continuity can not be defined as a pointwise property of  @xmath38 .",
    "meanwhile , in the framework of robinson s theory , it is possible to give a definition of uniform continuity of the real function  @xmath38 in terms of its natural hyperreal extension , denoted @xmath39 in such a way that the definition is local , in the sense of depending only on each pointwise cluster ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 104 ] ) in the domain of  @xmath37 .",
    "thus ,  @xmath38 is uniformly continuous on  @xmath40 if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath41 here  @xmath42 stands for the relation of being infinitely close . the condition must be satisfied at the infinite hyperreals  @xmath43 , in addition to the finite ones .",
    "this addition is what distinguishes uniform continuity from ordinary continuity .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath44 '' is employed in standard real analysis to define a formal completion of the real line  @xmath40 , namely @xmath45 ( sometimes a formal point  `` @xmath46 '' is added , as well ) .",
    "such a formal device is helpful in simplifying the statements of certain theorems ( which would otherwise have a number of subcases ) .",
    "the symbol is used in a _",
    "different _ sense in topology and projective geometry , where the thom compactification  @xmath47 of  @xmath40 is a circle : @xmath48 we have refrained from using the symbol `` @xmath44 '' to denote an infinite hyperreal , as in @xmath49 even though the symbol `` @xmath44 '' does convey the idea of the infinite more effectively than the symbol `` @xmath4 '' that we have used .",
    "the reason is so as to avoid the risk of creating a false impression of the uniqueness of an infinite point ( as in or above ) , in the field  @xmath50 ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 102 ] ) .",
    "we represent the hyperreal @xmath51 visually by means of an infinite - resolution microscope already exploited for pedagogical purposes by keisler @xcite .",
    "the hyperreal  @xmath34 appearing in the diagram of figure  [ micro ] illustrates graphically the strict hyperreal inequality @xmath52 where , as we already mentioned , the symbol  @xmath4 is exploited to denote a fixed infinite robinson hyperinteger ( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 108 ] ) .",
    "to calculate the slope of the tangent line to the curve @xmath53 at @xmath54 , we first compute the ratio @xmath55 where we have deleted the underbrace @xmath56 and also shortened the symbol  @xmath0 to @xmath57 , so as to lighten the notation .     at @xmath54,height=288 ]",
    "therefore the slope is @xmath58 note that @xmath59 in lightstone s notation , where the digit `` 1 '' appears in the @xmath60-decimal place , as illustrated in figure  [ slope ] .",
    "everyone who has ever held an electronic calculator is familiar with the curious phenomenon of it sometimes returning the value @xmath61 in place of the expected  @xmath62 .",
    "for instance , a calculator programmed to apply newton s method to find the zero of a function , may return the  @xmath63 value as the unique zero of the function @xmath64 developing a model to account for such a phenomenon is complicated by the variety of the degree of precision displayed , as well as the greater precision typically available internally than that displayed on the lcd . to simplify matters",
    ", we will consider an idealized model , called a _",
    "hypercalculator _ , of a theoretical calculator that applies newton s method precisely  @xmath4 times , where  @xmath4 is a fixed infinite hyperinteger , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "let  @xmath38 be a concave increasing differentiable function with domain an open interval  @xmath65 and vanishing at its midpoint .",
    "then the hypercalculator applied to  @xmath38 will return a hyperreal decimal  @xmath0 with an initial segment consisting of an unbounded number of repeated  @xmath3 s .",
    "assume for simplicity that  @xmath66 .",
    "we have @xmath67 by the mean value theorem , there is a point  @xmath68 such that  @xmath69 where  @xmath70 , or @xmath71 since  @xmath38 is concave , its derivative  @xmath72 is decreasing , hence @xmath73 thus  @xmath74 .",
    "inductively , the point  @xmath75 satisfies  @xmath76 for all  @xmath16 . by the transfer principle",
    "( see section  [ ten ] , item  [ 101 ] ) , the hyperreal  @xmath77 satisfies a strict inequality @xmath78 as well ( cf .  ) .",
    "hence the hypercalculator returns a value strictly smaller than  @xmath1 yet infinitely close to  @xmath1 , proving the theorem .",
    "the precise meaning of the finite expression @xmath79 is that the repeated digit 9 occurs precisely  @xmath16 times .",
    "the standard non - terminating decimal @xmath80 as it is traditionally written , is said to have an unbounded number of repeated digits 9 , but the expression  infinitely many  9 s \" is only a figure of speech , as  infinity \" is not a number in standard analysis , in the sense that , whenever a precise meaning is attributed to the phrase  infinitely many  9 s \" , it is almost invariably in terms of _",

    "experience shows that toeing the standard line on the unital evaluation of  @xmath165 possesses a high - frustration factor in the classroom . rather than baffling the student with such a categorical claim ,",
    "a teacher could proceed by presenting the following ten points , based on the material outlined in section  [ ten ] :    1 .",
    "the reals are not , as the rationals are not , the maximal number system ; 2 .   there exist larger number systems , containing infinitesimals ; 3 .",
    "in such larger systems , the interval  @xmath2 $ ] contains many numbers infinitely close to  @xmath1 ; 4 .   in a particular larger system",
    "called the hyperreal numbers , there is a generalized notion of decimal expansion for such numbers , starting in each case with an unbounded number of digits  `` @xmath3 '' ; 5 .",
    "all such numbers therefore have an arguable claim to the notation  `` @xmath0 '' which is patently ambiguous ( the meaning of the ellipsis  `` @xmath166 '' requires disambiguation ) ; 6 .",
    "all but _ one _ of them are strictly smaller than  @xmath1 ; 7 .",
    "the _ convention _ adopted by most professional mathematicians is to interpret the symbol `` @xmath0 '' as referring to the _ largest _ such number , namely  @xmath1 itself ; 8 .",
    "thus , the students intuition that  @xmath0 falls just short of  @xmath1 can be justified in a mathematically rigorous fashion ; 9 .",
    "the said extended number system is mostly relevant in infinitesimal calculus ( also known as differential and integral calculus ) ; 10 .",
    "if you would like to learn more about the hyperreals , go to your teacher so he can give you further references .",
    "a goal of our , admittedly non - standard , analysis is both to educate and to heal .",
    "the latter part involves placing balm upon the bewilderment of myriad students of decimal notation , frustrated by the reluctance of their education professionals to yield as much as an infinitesimal iota in their evaluation of the symbol  @xmath167 , or to acknowledge the ambiguity of an ellipsis .",
