    "the transmission through a potential barrier is a remarkable feature of quantum mechanics . since gamow s theory of alpha decay , in 1928 , it has been used to explain a variety of new phenomena . in particular , the transmission coefficients through the coulomb barrier has been an important ingredient in calculations of heavy ion fusion cross sections along the last few decades . in single - channel descriptions of heavy ion scattering , fusion is frequently simulated by a strong imaginary potential acting in the inner side of the coulomb barrier . since the fraction of the incident current that reaches the strong absorption region",
    "is fully absorbed , the fusion probability at each partial - wave can be approximated by the transmission coefficient through the coulomb+centrifugal barriers .",
    "+ although the transmission coefficients through an arbitrary potential barrier can be evaluated by numerical procedures , it is convenient to have analytical expressions .",
    "this is possible in some particular cases , like the parabolic barrier  @xcite and the morse  @xcite barrier .",
    "parabolic barriers have been used for decades in fusion reactions of heavy ions  @xcite . in this case , the barrier at each partial wave is approximated by a parabola , with properly chosen parameters , and the transmission coefficients are given by an analytical expression involving these parameters . however , although this approximation is very good near the barrier radius , it becomes progressively worse as the radial distance increases .",
    "the reason for this shortcoming is that the parabola is symmetric around the barrier radius , whereas the actual barrier is highly asymmetric .",
    "the latter falls off very slowly at large distances ( like @xmath0 ) , while the former decreases rapidly .",
    "this exerts great influence on the transmission coefficient at energies well below the barrier , which are very sensitive to the potential at large distances .",
    "thus , the parabolic approximation can not be used to evaluate transmission coefficients in this energy region .",
    "the situation is better if one approximates the coulomb barrier by a morse function .",
    "although it leads to a more complicated analytical expression , this barrier has the advantage of being asymmetric .",
    "similarly to the coulomb barrier , it falls off slowly at the tail , and rapidly in the inner region .",
    "+ owing to the short wavelengths involved in heavy ion collisions the transmission coefficients are frequently evaluated by semiclassical approximations , like the wkb ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "however , although this approximation has been very successful at energies well below the coulomb barrier , it fails at energies near the coulomb barrier and above .",
    "kemble  @xcite derived an improved version of the wkb approximation that remains valid at energies just below the coulomb barrier .",
    "further , he suggested that his expression for the transmission coefficient could be extended to energies above the barrier through an analytical continuation of the radial variable to the complex plane . in a previous work  @xcite , we followed this procedure to study kemble s approximation for a typical heavy ion potential , below and above the barrier .",
    "we concluded that the transmission coefficient and cross sections evaluated in this way were in good agreement with their quantum mechanical counterparts .",
    "+ the present work reports a detailed study of parabolic and morse approximations for the coulomb+centrifugal barriers , and the resulting transmission coefficients and fusion cross sections .",
    "it investigates also the use of kemble s approximation for the transmission coefficients through these barriers , at energies above and below the coulomb barrier .",
    "we show that kemble s approximation in these cases becomes exact , independently of the collision energy .",

    "v , we present the conclusions of the present work .",
    "in single - channel descriptions of heavy ion scattering the fusion process is usually simulated by an imaginary potential .",
    "this potential is very strong and has a short range , so that it acts exclusively in the inner region of the potential barrier , resulting from nuclear attraction plus coulomb repulsion .",
    "the scattering wave function is expanded in partial waves , leading to a radial equation for each angular momentum .",
    "the real part of the potential , appearing in the radial equations , can be written as @xmath5 where the coulomb interaction between the finite nuclei is usually approximated by the expression @xmath6 with @xmath7 in the above equations , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are respectively the projectile s and target s atomic ( mass ) numbers , and we take @xmath12 fm .",
    "different procedures have been proposed to determine the nuclear interaction between two heavy ions ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . among them , the double folding model  @xcite is a systematic procedure that has the advantage of being applicable to any heavy ion system . in this model ,",
    "the potential is given by a multi - dimensional integral involving the densities of the two nuclei and a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "on the other hand , this model has the unpleasant feature of requiring the evaluation of a rather complicate integral . to avoid this problem ,",
