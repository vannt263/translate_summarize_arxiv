    "the connections between cosmology and particle physics through dark datter ( dm ) have recently received special attention for defining the physics program at the tev frontier .",
    "we foresee that the combination of data from satellites , direct dm searches , hadron and lepton colliders will provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of dark matter and its interactions in the early universe .",
    "these expectations are supported by the fact that there are several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , which include a new , stable , weakly - interacting massive particle , which may be responsible for the observed relic dm in the universe .",
    "this particle should become accessible to particle colliders operating at the tev energy frontier , as well as to the next generations of direct dm search experiments .",
    "the lhc collider will be first in providing data to address the question of whether one of these scenarios is indeed realised in nature .",
    "if this is the case , it will also gather some quantitative information to be related to the relic dm density measured from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectra  @xcite . however , it is understood that the lhc data will not be exhaustive in this respect .",
    "first , it will not be possible to infer , in a model independent way , the relic density to an accuracy close to that already achieved by cmb observations .",
    "furthermore , there exist classes of models of new physics which the lhc may not be able to disentangle and probe in sufficient details .",
    "it is only with the measurements becoming available at an electron positron collider , operating at centre - of - mass energies of order of 1  tev , that we shall be able to determine the properties of the dm candidate particle and of the other particles participating in its interactions in the early universe , with sufficient accuracy to predict the dm relic density precisely . with these results in hand",
    ", the comparison of the data from cmb experiments , direct dm searches and collider experiments would have striking consequences on our quantitative understanding of the nature and distribution of dark matter in the universe .    in these years",
    "preceding lhc operation , supersymmetry has emerged as the best motivated theory of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it solves a number of open problems intrinsic to the sm and , most important to our discussion , the conservation of r - parity introduces the lightest neutralino , @xmath2 , as a new stable , weakly interacting particle .",
    "cmb data from the wmap satellite , and other astrophysical data , already set rather stringent bounds on the parameters of supersymmetry , if the lightest neutralino is responsible for saturating the amount of dm observed in the universe .",
    "the recently released , five - year wmap data provide a determination of the dark matter density as @xmath3 = 0.110@xmath40.006  @xcite .    the potential of the lhc and of an @xmath5 linear collider operating at 0.5  tev and 1.0  tev , such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) , for determining the neutralino relic density , @xmath6 , in supersymmetry has been investigated in detail in  @xcite .",
    "that study selected a set of benchmark points , the so - called lcc points , representative of various supersymmetric scenarios and determined the @xmath6 probability density function by a scan of the full parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , by retaining those points compatible with the measurements available at the lhc and ilc , within their experimental accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we consider one of the supersymmetric scenarios defined in  @xcite , for which the neutralino relic density is controlled by its annihilation rate through the cp - even heavy higgs pole @xmath7 , which in turn crucially depends on the value of the mass of the boson , @xmath8 .",
    "we study the accuracy of the measurement of the relevant properties of the neutral heavy higgs boson @xmath9 : its mass , @xmath8 , width , @xmath10 and decay branching fractions as can be obtained from data collected in high luminosity @xmath5 collisions at centre - of - mass energy of 1  tev , using full simulation of the response of a realistic detector model and detailed event reconstruction .",
    "we adopt the lcc-4 benchmark point of  @xcite , which is defined in the reduced paramater space of the constrained mssm by @xmath11=380  gev , @xmath12=420  gev , @xmath13=53 , @xmath14=0 , @xmath15=+1 and @xmath16=178  gev .",
    "we use isasugra 7.69  @xcite to compute the physical particle spectrum and we get @xmath8=419.4  gev , @xmath17=169.1  gev and @xmath18=195.5  gev .",
    "these parameters correspond to a neutralino relic density of @xmath19 = 0.108 , as obtained by using the micromegas 2.0 program  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 process at @xmath1 = 1  tev has already been studied for lcc-4 using a parametric simulation  @xcite .",
    "we now perform a detailed study using geant-4-based full simulation  @xcite of the detector response and reconstruct the physics objects using processors developed in the marlin framework  @xcite and extend the analysis to both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 final states .",
    "this study adopts the ldc detector concept , which is based on a large continuous gaseous tracker , a time projection chamber , surrounded by a highly granular siw calorimeter and complemented by a high resolution si vertex tracker .",
    "the ldc detector concept is discussed in detail elsewhere@xcite , the design is optimised for achieving excellent parton energy measurements through the particle flow algorithm , and precise extrapolation of particle tracks to their production point .",
    "both of these features are important to this analysis , which aims at suppressing backgrounds by exploiting the signature 4-@xmath23 and 2-@xmath23 + 2-@xmath24 final states of the signal , and requires good determinaton of energy and direction of hadronic jets to attain an optimal resolution on di - jet invariant mass .",
    "signal events have been generated with pythia 6.205  @xcite + isasugra 7.69 , including beamstrahlung effects  @xcite . at @xmath1",
    "= 1  tev , the effective @xmath25 production cross section , accounting for beamstrahlung and initial state radiation , is 1.4  fb , br(@xmath26 ) = br(@xmath27 ) = 0.87 and br(@xmath28 ) = br(@xmath29 ) = 0.13 .",
    "the main particle pair production backgrounds , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , have been generated using pythia .",
    "their cross sections , computed using comphep 4.4.0  @xcite , are 0.17  pb , 3.0  pb and 0.19  pb respectively .",
    "the inclusive @xmath21 and @xmath22 production , after subtracting the contribution of the @xmath33 channel and requiring 200  gev @xmath34 600  gev , have cross sections of 0.63  fb and 0.28  fb respectively .",
    "these processes have been generated at parton level using comphep and then hadronised with pythia .",
    "we assume to operate the linear collider at @xmath1=1  tev for a total integrated luminosity of 2  ab@xmath35 , which corresponds to 5  years ( 1  yr = 10@xmath36  s ) of operation for a nominal luminosity of @xmath37  @xmath38  s@xmath35 .",
    "a loose event preselection based on event variables has been applied after generation .",

    "data are persisted using lcio  @xcite collections and used as input for the subsequent reconstruction in marlin .",
    "pattern recognition and track fit are performed first using monte carlo truth information ( `` mc truth patrec '' ) and , for signal events , also genuine full pattern recognition ( `` full patrec '' ) , using the fullldctracking package based on delphi experiment software  @xcite .",

    "jet clustering is performed using the durham algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the jet energy resolution has been studied using a simulated sample of single @xmath23 jets in the energy range from 10  gev to 210  gev over a polar angle , @xmath39 .",
    "we get @xmath40 , which is consistent with the ldc particle flow performance specifications .",
    "jet flavour tagging is performed using the lcfivertex package , which developed the original zvtop tagger  @xcite and feeds track and vertex topological information into a neural network to distinguish between @xmath23 , @xmath41 and light quark jets .",
    "the di - jet mass resolution in the @xmath21 has been improved by performing a constrained kinematic fit .",
    "we have ported the pufitc algorithm  @xcite , developed for the delphi experiment at lep2 , into a dedicated marlin processor .",
    "the algorithm adjusts the momenta of the jets given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fitted momentum , @xmath44 is the measured momentum , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are unit vectors transverse to @xmath44 and to each other , and @xmath47 , @xmath23 and @xmath41 are free parameters in the fit .",
    "the adjusted momenta satisfy a set of constraints while minimising the fit @xmath48 , given by @xmath49  @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the expected energy loss parameter , @xmath52 is the energy spread parameter and @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the transverse momentum spread parameters . in this analysis , we impose the following constraints : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where the last condition accounts for beamstrahlung along the beam axis , @xmath57 .",
    "first we analyse the fully hadronic final state .",
    "this provides with characteristics four @xmath23 jet , symmetric events .",
    "the backgrounds can be significantly suppressed using @xmath23-tagging , event - shape and kinematic variables .",
    "we require selected events to fulfill the following criteria : total recorded energy in the event @xmath58 700  gev , total transverse energy @xmath59350  gev , total number of reconstructed particles @xmath6080 , number of charged particles @xmath6130 , event thrust @xmath620.9 and @xmath630.002 , where @xmath64 is the 3 to 4 jet cross - over value of the jet clustering algorithm .",
    "the distributions of some of these variables are shown in figure  [ fig : cuts ] for backgrounds and signal , for which a comparison of the generator - level and reconstructed values is also given .",
    "after event selection , particles are forced into four jets , which are arranged into two di - jet pairs , using the pairing which minimises the difference between the di - jet masses , @xmath65 .",
    "the kinematic fit is performed and a cut applied on the resulting di - jet mass difference @xmath6650  gev to eliminate poorly reconstructed events .",
    "both di - jet masses are required to satisfy @xmath67200  gev .",
    "the event is required to have four @xmath23 jets , where a @xmath23 jet is determined by the following criteria : total jet multiplicity @xmath6010 , charged jet multiplicity @xmath685 , and b jet probability , @xmath69 , larger than 0.5 . at the chosen working point ,",
    "an efficiency for @xmath23 jets of 0.79 is obtained , using `` mc truth patrec '' , with sufficient rejection of lighter quarks to effectively suppress the remaining non-@xmath23 backgrounds . by using `` full patrec '' without retraining the neural net ,",
    "we measure a tagging efficiency of 0.72 per jet .",
    "events , in which the incorrect jet pairing ( ijp ) is chosen , are considered as background . ]",
    "the di - jet mass for signal @xmath70 events fulfilling the selection cuts has a gaussian resolution of 23  gev using tracks reconstructed with `` mc truth patrec '' and 27  gev using tracks from `` full patrec '' before the kinematic fit . after applying the kinematic fit",
    "the di - jet mass resolutions become 13.7  gev and 13.8  gev , respectively    after final selection , the sample of events with di - jet masses in the region 200  gev  @xmath71  550  gev gives a selection efficiency for signal @xmath72 decays of 0.24@xmath40.01 using tracks reconstructed with `` mc truth patrec '' and 0.17@xmath40.01 using `` full patrec '' .",
    "the difference is mostly caused by the observed drop in b - tagging efficiency .",
    "the corresponding acceptance for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and inclusive @xmath21 background events is @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the resulting mass distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : jjmass ] , which has two entries per event .",
    "the signal is described by the convolution of two breit - wigner functions with a mass splitting of 1.4  gev , as predicted for the lcc-4 parameters , convoluted with a double gaussian resolution function .",
    "the background is described by a third - order polynomial with coefficients determined on background only events .",
    "the final fit function consists of a linear combination of the signal and background functions with four free parameters : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the weights of the signal and background functions .",
    "we get @xmath77 = ( 419.7@xmath41.0 )  gev and @xmath78 = ( 14.9@xmath42.9 )  gev , where the quoted uncertainties are statistical only .",
    "this result is remarkably close to that obtained in the earlier analysis , based on parametric detector simulation . using `` full patrec '' the uncertainties on the @xmath9 boson mass and width increase to 1.3  gev and 3.4  gev , respectively .",
    "the mixed decay mode @xmath22 can be isolated by tagging a @xmath80 di - jet , consistent with originating from either a @xmath81 or a @xmath9 decay and analysing the remaining particles in the event .",
    "we require the events to fullfill the following criteria : @xmath82400  gev , 200  gev@xmath83900  gev , 40@xmath84180 , 15@xmath85100 , event thrust@xmath620.8 , event sphericity @xmath860.1 and @xmath630.005 .",

    "the number of charged particles with energy greater than 5  gev which are not associated to either of the @xmath23 jets must not exceed six .",
    "finally , @xmath24 tagging is performed .",
    "we have developed an algorithm which outputs a linear discriminant variable @xmath92 based on the jet mass , the impact parameter of the leading track , and a variable , @xmath93 , which measures the jet energy deposited in an annulus around the jet direction .",
    "at least one of the two non-@xmath23 jets must be tagged as a @xmath24 jet , where a @xmath24 jet must have less than four energetic charged particles and must satisfy @xmath940.8 . to distinguish between signal @xmath95 and @xmath22 decays , a discriminant variable @xmath96 is calculated based on the un - tagged dijet energy , the number of energetic charged particles not associated to either of the two @xmath23 jets , and @xmath97 , the larger of the two tau jet probabilities ( see figure  [ fig : pdisc ] ) .",

    "the selection criteria yield 87 events of signal with 89 of background , corresponding to a relative statistical uncertainty of 0.15 on the determination of br(@xmath81 , @xmath103 ) .",
    "the constraints on lcc-4 derived from this determination of the @xmath9 mass and width and other supersymmetric particle mass measurements at the lhc and a 1  tev linear collider , provide a prediction of the neutralino relic density with a relative accuracy of 0.18 , within the general mssm  @xcite . the main contribution to",
    "the remaining uncertainty comes from the weak constraint which data provide to mssm solutions where @xmath6 is significantly lower than its reference value for lcc-4 .",
    "a detailed study shows that these solutions are all characterised by large values of the stau trilinear coupling , @xmath104 . in the mssm the @xmath105 coupling to the @xmath81 and @xmath9",
    "bosons scales as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "it has been proposed to determine @xmath104 through a measurement of the branching fraction of @xmath9 , @xmath108  @xcite . in the funnel region",

    "the only @xmath9 decay into @xmath105s allowed by cp symmetry is @xmath111 which is kinematically forbidden for the lcc-4 parameters .     and @xmath9 decay branching fractions as a function of the stau trilinear coupling @xmath104 as predicted by hdecay .",
    "all the other mssm parameters have been kept fixed to those of the lcc-4 point . ]",
    "however , at large values of @xmath112 , the @xmath113 decay gets a sizeable enhancement of its branching fraction . in this regime",
    ", this channel also contributes to the neutralino annihilation rate through the @xmath114 process , thus lowering the corresponding relic density , as observed in the mssm scans . at the same time , a determination of the branching fraction of the decay @xmath113 , allows us to constrain the stau trilinear coupling .",

    "now , due to the same final state , a large @xmath115 yield can be detected by a standard @xmath116 analysis , such as that discussed in the previous section the present study shows that the branching fraction for @xmath81 , @xmath117 can be determined to @xmath4 0.15 and that for @xmath9 , @xmath27 to @xmath4 0.07 , from which a limit @xmath118 250  gev can be derived .",
    "this constraint suppresses the tail at low values of @xmath6 bringing the prediction for the neutralino relic density to a relative accuracy of 0.08 , which is comparable to the current accuracy from the wmap data .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 process at @xmath1 = 1  tev using on fully simulated and reconstructed events for a supersymmetric benchmark point where the mass of the @xmath9 boson is 419  gev and the relic dark matter density in the universe crucially depends on its mass and width .",
    "we find that the analysis of 2  ab@xmath35 of data should probide with relative accuracies of 1.0  gev and 2.9  gev in the heavy boson masses and widths , respectively .",
    "the branching fractions of the @xmath119 decay can be determined with a 0.15 relative accuracy .",
    "these data , in combination with other measurements available at the lhc and a @xmath5 linear collider , allows to infer the neutralino relic density in the universe with a relative accuracy of 0.08 .",
