    "more than a decade ago it was realized that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can be divided into two well - defined sub - populations : the majority of the observed bursts ( about 3/4 ) had durations longer than @xmath6s and relatively softer observed spectra , and the minority ( @xmath7 ) had short durations and harder observed spectra @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the two components of this bimodal population are often referred to as long - soft grbs and short - hard grbs ( shbs hereafter ) .",
    "observational evidence accumulated in the last few years has conclusively shown that long - soft grbs are associated with supernovae ( sne ) , and result from the death of short - lived massive stars @xcite .",
    "comparable studies of shbs were not conducted due to observational difficulties in obtaining accurate localizations for these events .",
    "a breakthrough in the study of shbs occurred earlier this year when the _ swift _ and _ hete-2 _ satellites provided the first timely and accurate localizations of shbs 050509b , 050709 and 050724 , leading to the detection of afterglow emission in x - ray , optical , ir and radio wavelengths , as well as to the identification and study of the host galaxies of these events @xcite .",
    "these studies provide three strong indications that shbs result from a different type of physical progenitor system .",
    "first , in all three events there are no indications of an associated sn , to within strict limits .",
    "sne similar to those associated with long - soft grbs would have been easily detected .",
    "second , two of these events occurred within early - type galaxies , with little or no recent star formation .",
    "none of the many tens of long - soft grbs with comparable data are detected in such galaxies .",
    "finally , all of these bursts occurred relatively nearby , at redshifts @xmath8 , in contrast with long grbs that are typically at @xmath9 . taken together these observational facts strongly indicate that shbs have a different type of progenitor system , and that some of these progenitors are long - lived ( @xmath10 gyr ) .",
    "the most popular model ( e.g. , @xcite ) for shbs invokes the merger of two compact objects , such as double neutron stars ( dns ) or a neutron star and a black hole ( ns - bh ) .",
    "such models are appealing because they predict events with comparable timescale and energy release to those observed in short bursts",
    ". such considerations , combined with the recent results showing that shbs require a long - lived progenitor system , led several groups to suggest that shbs result from compact binary mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more detailed comparisons with model predictions were limited by the small numbers of shbs with known host galaxies and redshifts .",
    "@xcite have expanded the sample of shbs available for study using new and archival observations of `` historical '' shbs , allowing them to establish a statistically significant association between two additional shbs ( 790613 and 000607 ) and their probable host galaxies or clusters . combining these data with observations of the recent _ swift _ and _ hete-2 _ shbs discussed above , and an additional _ swift _ burst ( shb 050813 ) possibly located in a @xmath11 galaxy cluster @xcite , @xcite confronted predictions from binary ns merger models @xcite with the properties of the observed shb sample .",
    "they found that the model predictions are difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed shb sample , since the range of models considered in the literature inevitably predicts a large fraction of short - lived merging systems , which will preferably reside in late - type hosts and occur at higher redshifts , in contrast with the observed shb sample which is dominated by events located in early - type hosts and at lower redshifts .    in this work",
    "we apply a refined theoretical analysis to the @xcite sample in order to constrain the local rate and the lifetime of shb progenitors .",
    "our goal is to confront our findings with compact binary models for shbs and discuss the implication for gravitational wave detection from shbs by the ligo and virgo observatories .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we develop the theory that we need for the analysis of the data in  2 . the observed sample ,",
    "its analysis and the derived constraints are presented in  3 .",
    "we compare our results to the predictions of compact binary mergers in  4 and discuss the prospects for detecting gws from shbs under the assumption that they originate from a dns or bh - ns mergers in  5 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "we use the combination of the two - dimensional _ observed _ redshift and luminosity distribution together with the observed shb flux distribution ( logn - logs ) , to constrain the _",
    "intrinsic _ shb rate at redshift @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the intrinsic luminosity function @xmath14 .",
    "this method is an extension of previous works @xcite that used only the one - dimensional observed redshift distribution and the peak flux distribution .",
    "although we focus here on shbs , the method is applicable to long - soft grbs as well .",
    "the two - dimensional observed redshift and luminosity distribution is derived from the intrinsic distributions via : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the _ observed _ shb rate and @xmath14 is the _ intrinsic _ peak luminosity function ( which we assume to be independent of z ) .",
    "@xmath17 is the probability for detection ( including redshift determination ) of a burst with a peak photon flux @xmath18 which in turn depends on @xmath19 and @xmath12 as well as on the spectrum of the bursts .",
    "@xmath13 is the intrinsic shb rate per unit comoving volume and comoving time .",

    "this limit is based on a null detection of luminosity overdensities in the fields of these shbs , and thus no host galaxy information is available . since @xcite used a luminosity - based test for associating hosts with shbs , their search may be biased against bursts in low - lumiosity galaxies , and against bursts at high redshift . to avoid the bias mentioned above our statistical analysis",

    "this method does not depend on the luminosity function or the instrumental thresholds and thus it constitutes an independent corroboration of our results .",

    "the observed redshift distribution of the extended sample ( 8 bursts ) should be similar to the batse redshift distribution of batse bursts .",

    "the rate of shbs observed by batse is a strict lower limit since it does not include undetected shbs .",

    "the progenitors of shbs are almost certainly a product of at least one core - collapse supernova ( e.g. , a neutron star ) and the shb itself is most likely a catastrophic event , therefore the rate of shbs is limited by the rate of core - collapse sne . since we find that the typical lifetime of shb progenitors is several gyr the local rate of shbs is limited by the rate of core collapse sne at a redshift @xmath180 @xcite . together with the observed lower limit we find that the local rate of shbs , @xmath181 , is in the range : @xmath182    constraining the local rate within this range requires an estimate of the beaming factor ( i.e. , the fraction of the @xmath183 solid angle into which the prompt gamma - rays are emitted ) , @xmath184 , and of the luminosity function .",
    "the value of the beaming factor is currently unknown , however , the afterglows of two shbs ( 050709 and 050724 ) have shown a steepening that can be interpreted as a hint of a jet @xcite .",

    "this high rate is highly uncertain at this point but we consider it to be the most favored by the synthesis of current observations .",
    "this rate is only slightly smaller than the upper limit we obtained ( eq . [ eq sne rate ] ) , implying that if this estimate is correct a significant fraction of all the end products of core - collapse sne are producing shbs .",
    "alternatively , perhaps a source can produce more than a single shb ( i.e. shbs are not catastrophic events ) .",
    "the upper limit that we find does not pose at the moment a stringent limit on the beaming or on @xmath115 .",
    "however , if in the future bursts with a luminosity of @xmath191 erg / s will be observed , it will constrain the beaming to be smaller than @xmath192 .",
    "the merger rates of dns and bh - ns systems are currently estimated in two ways , based on observed systems in our galaxy and using theoretical population synthesis .",
    "estimates based on observed dns binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) provide a lower limit on the local rate of dns merger events because of possible unaccounted for selection affects ( e.g. , binary formation that does not recycle neither of the neutron stars ) .",
    "the absence of observed bh - ns systems together with poor understanding of selection affects involved in their discovery renders this method unapplicable in this case .",
    "population syntheses ( e.g. @xcite ) do not suffer from observational selection effects and can address both dns and bh - ns binaries .",
    "however , the uncertainties involved are substantial , with rate estimates spanning over three orders of magnitude .",
    "the estimates based on observed dns systems were drastically revised with the discovery of the relativistic binary pulsar psr  j0737@xmath1933039 @xcite . based on three observed dns binaries @xcite find a range of galactic merger rates from @xmath194 to @xmath195yr@xmath196  at 95% confidence .",
    "this estimate is larger by a factor of 6 - 7 than the estimates that they obtained excluding psr  j0737@xmath1933039 .",

    "this rate corresponds to a local rate density of @xmath199 .",
    "regardless of the exact values of the above estimated rate , the merger rate for observed dns binaries is dominated by systems with short lifetimes .",
    "this is demonstrated , for example , by the fact that the detection of psr  j0737@xmath1933039 ( with a merger timescale of @xmath120myr ) significantly increased the estimated merger rate @xcite .",
    "note that this drastic revision in the rate is partially due to the short lifetime of this double pulsar .",
    "numerous new binaries with long lifetimes need to be discovered if old binaries are to dominate the merger rate in our galaxy .",
    "the rates found by population syntheses for dns systems are in general consistent with the rate deduced from the observations .",
    "analysis of bh - ns binaries shows that their merger rate may be comparable , or even larger by an order of magnitude @xcite , than the rate of dns mergers .",
    "population synthesis provides a rather robust upper limit on the rate of dns and bh - ns mergers by considering the fraction of binaries that survive two core - collapse sne .",
    "several theoretical works ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that this fraction is likely to be @xmath200 and can be as high as @xmath201 . taking this fraction from the local rate of core - collapse sne @xcite implies an upper limit of @xmath202 on the merger rate of short - lived binaries ( @xmath203 gyr ) .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath204 on the merger rate of long - lived binaries(@xmath205 gyr ) is obtained by considering the rate of core - collapse sne at redshift 0.7 @xcite .",
    "dns or bh - ns mergers are currently the most popular models for shbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the proposed association is based on the tight limits that are imposed on the progenitor by the large energy release ( @xmath206 erg ) and the short timescales ( @xmath207 ) observed in these bursts .",
    "not many sources can produce such an electromagnetic display , while an extensive numerical effort ( e.g. @xcite ) has shown that the mergers of dns and bh - ns systems can .    the range of shb rates that we find ( eq . [ eq r_shb_z0 ] ) overlaps the predicted rate of dns mergers based on observations ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "however , the range of progenitor lifetimes we find for shbs is inconsistent with that of the observed dns binaries .",
    "the reason is that the merger rate of the latter is dominated by short - lived binaries ( @xmath209myr ) while shb progenitors are much older ( @xmath210gyr ) .",
    "we do not see any obvious selection effect that may operate and can be applied to the current dns models and explain this discrepancy . on the contrary , while very tight dns binaries ( with very short lifetimes ) can avoid detection in pulsar surveys because of their large orbital accelerations , long - lived systems are detected with relative ease as long as one of the neutron stars is an active pulsar .",
    "admittedly , the probability that both members of a dns binary are dead pulsars ( i.e. , undetectable ) , increases with its age .",
    "however , our limits on the lifetime distribution of shbs constrain it to be shallower than @xmath211 ( at @xmath82 confidence level ) .",
    "in other words , the number of newly born shb progenitors with a lifetime between @xmath212 gyr is larger by a factor @xmath213 than those with lifetime @xmath179 myr .",
    "therefore , if dns binaries are the progenitors of shbs , for every recently born dns with a lifetime @xmath179 myr we expect to observe at least several recently born systems with a lifetime of @xmath212 gyr .",
    "all of these coeval systems are presumably equally detectable via pulsar surveys . in reality",
    "there is one observed dns with a lifetime of @xmath179 myr and only one with a lifetime of @xmath212 gyr ( b1534 + 12 , which is most likely older than 100 myr ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that with the caveat of small number statistics , the observed population of dns systems is unlikely to be the dominant component among shb progenitors .",
    "it is possible that known dns pulsars are not representative of the larger population of relativistic dns systems .",
    "this might be the case if large numbers of relativistic dns systems are formed without recycled pulsars , or alternatively if the milky - way dns population do not represent the cosmic one .",
    "we thus conclude that shb observations disfavor a dns merger origin to the extent that they indicate that an unexpected hidden population of old long - lived systems should be invoked .",
    "while we can not exclude the existence of such a population at the moment , it remains to be seen whether it can be reproduced by population synthesis models . turning the argument around ,",
    "if dns binaries are the progenitors of shbs then there exists a large population of hitherto - undetected old dns systems .",
    "moreover , this scenario suggests that the rate of shbs is @xmath214 in order to dominate over the the merger rate of young dns systems found by @xcite , while conforming with the upper limit imposed by the rate of core - collapse sne at @xmath215 and the binary survival probability .",
    "it also excludes the existence of the recently - hypothesized dominant population of dns binaries with very short lifetimes @xcite .    the possibility that bh - ns systems are the dominant source of shbs can not be constrained at this time .",
    "there are no observational data on the properties of this population while the theoretical models are highly uncertain and their predictions vary significantly from one model to the next .",
    "if a link between shbs and bh - ns mergers will be established in the future , the observed shb properties can be used to constrain models of ns - bh binaries .",
    "progenitors of shbs may also be strong sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) . therefore , the local shb rate might has direct implications for the detection rate of gw telescopes in general and to the upcoming s5 run of initial ligo ( ligo - i ) in particular .",
    "the most promising progenitors for gw detection are ns - bh or dns mergers . as we discuss above our results disfavor , but can not exclude , dns binaries as the source of shbs , while the possibility that ns - bh binaries are the progenitors on shbs can not be constrained by the data .",
    "moreover , energy and time scale considerations favor compact binary mergers as the progenitors of shbs .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to discuss the predictions for the ligo and virgo gw observatories if shbs originates during such compact mergers .",
    "these sources are expected to be detected by ligo - i up to a distance of @xmath216 ~\\rm mpc$ ] ( @xcite ; hereafter the numbers without brackets are for ns - bh mergers assuming a bh mass of @xmath217 while the numbers within the brackets are for dns mergers can not produce the accretion disk that is believed to be necessary for the production of shbs .",
    "this result suggests that shbs can be produced only by mergers of bh and ns with similar masses . in this case",
    "the w detectability of bh - ns mergers is similar to that of dns mergers . ] ) .",
    "virgo design sensitivity is similar to that of ligo - i , and therefore the virgo detection rate is expected to be similar once its design sensitivity is achieved .",
    "if shbs are triggered by compact mergers , the prospects for gw detection from shbs are quite promising .",
    "a reasonable , but speculative , shb rate of @xmath218 ( see  [ sec rate ] ) , predicts a detection rate of @xmath219 $ ] mergers per year . this speculative rate is higher by a factor of @xmath220 than previous upper limits on merger rates derived from the local rate of core - collapse sne .",
    "the reason is that the long lifetime of shb progenitors relates them to sne at redshift @xmath221 , which was higher by a factor of @xmath220 than it is today .    the possible temporal coincidence between an shb and a gw signal , which may make the difference between detection and non - detection in the coming s5 run of ligo - i . a coincident detection increases the range of ligo - i and virgo by a factor of @xmath222 , while if shbs are preferentially beamed perpendicular to the binary orbital plane the range is increased by an additional factor of @xmath223 to a distance of @xmath224 ~\\rm{mpc}$ ] @xcite .",
    "hence ligo - i has a non - negligible probability to detect gws simultaneously with a _ swift _",
    "detection of an shb .",
    "our best fit model to the current observations ( @xmath58 , @xmath225 erg / s and any lifetime distribution that provides a large fraction of shbs at low redshift ) predicts that about @xmath226 of the shbs observed by batse are within @xmath227 mpc while about @xmath228 are within @xmath229 mpc .",
    "given that _",
    "swift _ detects @xmath220 shbs a year and that its threshold is comparable to that of batse , the expected rate of simultaneous detections of an shb and a gw signal is @xmath230 ~\\rm yr^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this rate depends on the beaming only through the assumption that shbs are beamed perpendicular to the binary orbital plane .",
    "it could be further increased by a search for simultaneous gw signals and shbs that are detected by _",
    "swift _ or the interplanetary network ( ipn ) but are not localized ( such bursts are currently not announced and are not included in the _ swift _ detection rate that we quote above ) .    simultaneous detection of the inspiral gw signal from a compact merger and an shb will provide a conclusive evidence that shbs originate from compact mergers and would improve our understanding of both merger physics and shbs significantly .",
    "gws can provide a unique view of the formation , and possibly the operation , of the inner engine powering burst , difficult to observe via any other observational method .",
    "if gws from a merger are detected without a detected shb , an association may still be secured by the detection of an on - axis orphan afterglow @xcite .",
    "the probability to detect an off - axis radio orphan afterglow as suggested by @xcite is low unless the beaming is not significant .",
    "the reason is that the isotropic energy of an shb that would be detected by ligo - i or virgo is expected to be @xmath231 erg , and if the beaming is significant , its total energy would be much lower , and the afterglow is expected to be too dim for detection by the time that the jet decelerates and spherical emission dominates .",
    "advanced ligo ( ligo - ii ) would be able to detect ns - bh [ dns ] mergers up to a distance of @xmath232 $ ] mpc @xcite .",
    "thus , if shbs originate in such mergers then a robust lower limit for the detection of gws by ligo - ii is @xmath233 ~\\rm yr^{-1}$ ] and the probable rate is larger by orders of magnitude .",
    "this rate is for detections of gw signals that are not associated with the prompt gamma - ray emission from an shb .",
    "as discussed above , simultaneous detections will increase the ligo - ii range by a factor of 1.5 - 2.5 to @xmath234 ~\\rm{gpc}$ ] @xcite .",

    "the gbm detector on _ glast _ is expected to have a threshold that is similar to batse and more than half sky field of view , and thus it is expected to detect at least @xmath237 shbs within a distance of @xmath238 mpc every year .",
    "the benefit of the simultaneous operation of ligo - ii and an efficient grb detector goes beyond the high likelihood to observe simultaneous shbs and mergers if they are associated - it will also be able to disprove the association at high significance if no simultaneous detection is observed .",
    "shbs may emit gws also if the progenitor is not a compact binary merger .",
    "any progenitor that involves the collapse of a rotating compact object to a black hole ( e.g. , the collapse of a rotating neutron star triggered by accretion ; @xcite ) will produce gravitational waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of these waves is highly uncertain .",
    "moreover , the absence of an accurate signal template will reduce its detectability .",
    "such gw signals would most likely not be detected even by ligo - ii at distances much greater than @xmath239 mpc ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "if shbs result from the collapse of a compact object that is not triggered by a merger , ligo - ii might detect several shbs if they are significantly beamed and/or @xmath240 erg / s .",
    "we have extended previous analysis schemes @xcite , combining the observed peak flux distribution and the two - dimensional observed redshift - luminosity distribution of shbs , to constrain their progenitor lifetime and their local rate .",
    "we apply this method to the extended sample of shbs with redshift constraints presented in @xcite .",

    "we find that observed dns binaries in our galaxy are unlikely to be a representative sample of shb progenitors .",
    "the reason is that the merger rate of the observed dns binaries is dominated by short - lived systems ( @xmath248myr ) while shb progenitors are much older ( @xmath249gyr ) .",
    "we are not aware of any obvious selection effect that would prevent the detection of recently formed yet long - lived dns binaries and therefore we conclude that our results disfavor dns systems as the progenitors of shbs .",
