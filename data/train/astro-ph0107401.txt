    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are among the oldest surviving stellar objects in the universe .",
    "they provide collections of population  ii stars with homogeneous abundances and histories , and unique stellar dynamical conditions .",
    "the milky way s globular cluster system ( gcs ) is the prototypical one , and its study has contributed much to our knowledge of stellar evolution and galactic structure .",
    "it is important to make sure that conclusions drawn from this study are not biased either because the milky way s gcs is somehow unusual or because our location in the galaxy prevents us from fully characterizing its properties .",
    "globular clusters in local group galaxies are particularly valuable for comparison with milky way globular clusters .",
    "m31 has the local group s largest globular cluster population , so it is a natural starting place for studies of extragalactic globular clusters .",
    "the first m31 globular cluster catalog was published by @xcite , followed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the most comprehensive recent catalog is that of @xcite ; recent works by @xcite and @xcite cover only portions of m31 .",
    "all of these catalogs contain objects which are not m31 globular clusters : for example , table  2 of @xcite lists 199 cluster candidates later shown to be non - clusters .",
    "the existing catalogs are also likely to be missing clusters due to magnitude , spatial coverage , and/or resolution limits .",
    "@xcite defined several samples of m31 globular clusters , including a ` confirmed ' sample ( 199 objects ) , an ` adopted best ' sample ( 298 objects ) , and an ` extended ' sample ( 356 objects ) . in @xcite",
    "we compiled a list of clusters and plausible candidates containing 435 objects .",
    "quantifying the extent of incompleteness and contamination in m31 globular cluster catalogs is extremely important for the interpretation of globular cluster system properties .",
    "for example , the spatial distribution of known clusters is flatter , and their globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) brighter , near the nucleus @xcite  is this because the clusters there are truly fewer and brighter , or because existing surveys have not detected the entire cluster population ?",
    "even the census of milky way clusters is likely to be incomplete : @xcite estimates that 1030 milky way globulars may be hidden behind the galactic bulge and therefore missing from current catalogs , which list about 150 objects @xcite .",
    "two such clusters were found by @xcite .",
    "it is not unreasonable to suspect that the m31 cluster catalogs could be incomplete by at least a similar fraction .",
    "ground - based high - resolution imaging and spectroscopy have been used to distinguish m31 globular clusters from interlopers such as foreground stars , background galaxies , and other objects belonging to m31 ( e.g. , h  ii regions and open clusters ) .",
    "the bright ( @xmath3 ) portion of m31 globular cluster catalogs has been fairly thoroughly examined using one or both of these methods . @xcite and @xcite used short - exposure ccd images taken in excellent seeing to determine if cluster candidates in the m31 halo were resolved into stars ; they found that majority of the halo cluster candidates were background galaxies , not clusters .",
    "radial velocities from optical spectroscopy have also been used by several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to eliminate background galaxies and foreground stars from cluster candidate lists . neither method is infallible , however : compact clusters may be mistaken for background galaxies if not resolved into stars , or for stars if they have a small radial velocity .",
    "km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the velocity range of m31 globular clusters is about + 70 to @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 , and the galactic models of @xcite predict that the radial velocities of milky way stars with similar colors and magnitudes to m31 globulars are in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 km  s@xmath4 . ] hst imaging , with its superior spatial resolution , is a useful tool for removing some of the ambiguities inherent in the ground - based studies .    at the distance modulus of m31 given by @xcite and @xcite ( @xmath8 , @xmath9  kpc ) , the angular resolution of hst s wfpc2 camera",
    "is equivalent to a spatial resolution of 0.38  pc . is very helpful for the identification of globular clusters in m31 .",
    "the differences between globular clusters and contaminating objects are much more obvious than with ground - based imaging .",
    "m31 has been a popular target for hst : as of 1 december 2000 , the hubble data archive contained almost 1100 wfpc2 images within 150  of the center of the galaxy .",
    "as of the same date , about two dozen m31 globular clusters had been specifically targeted for observation with hst , and the images of these clusters comprise about 20% of all the m31 images .",
    "the goal of most targeted hst observations of m31 globular clusters has been the production of color - magnitude diagrams for the clusters and surrounding stellar populations .",
    "hst programs which specifically targeted m31 globular clusters include gos 5112 , 5420 , 5464 , 5907 , 6477 , 6671 , 7826 , 8296 , and 8664 .",
    "our study uses the publicly - available archival data from these programs and many others .    in mid-2000",
    ", we began a project to search for globular clusters in archival hst images for the purpose of quantifying the incompleteness of existing cluster catalogs ; preliminary results were described in @xcite .",
    "the present paper report the results of our efforts to find globular and other star clusters in archival hst / wfpc2 images and their implications for catalog completeness and contamination .",
    "a companion paper @xcite presents measurements of the structural parameters of the clusters and their implications .",
    "we do not attempt to construct cmds for the clusters , since this work is already being carried out by other groups .",
    "we searched the hst archive for all wpfc2 observations with the following properties :    * center of field within @xmath10  of the center of m31 * broadband filter with central wavelength 300  nm or longer * total exposure time longer than 100  s.    these parameters were chosen to ensure that we would have a reasonable chance of detecting globular clusters if they were in the image fields .",
    "many images met the requirements , but since most positions had more than one observation per filter and observations in more than one filter , the images comprised only 157 separate fields .",
    "some of these fields were known to contain m31 globular clusters ; we retained these fields in our search as a check on our ability to identify clusters .",
    "we searched the images in only one filter per field .",
    "if more than one filter was available , we chose filters in the following order : f555w , f814w , f606w , f450w , f439w , f336w , f300w .",
    "( this ordering reflects the distribution filters used for the images combined with our desire to examine as many fields as possible in the same filter . ) information on the fields searched , including dataset name , location , filter , and exposure time is given in table  [ tbl - flds ] .",
    "the images searched are mostly in f555w and f814w , although there is at least one image in each of the filters listed above .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 100 to 8400  s. figure  [ field - pic ] shows the location of all fields on the sky .",
    "we retrieved the images from either the space telescope science institute or the canadian astronomy data centre . in both cases",
    "the images were pipeline - processed from the raw data at the time of retrieval with the best available calibration images . from stsci we retrieved individual hst images ; when multiple images existed for a single field ( e.g. , in the case of ` cosmic ray - split ' images ) , we combined the images using the iraf task crrej . from cadc we retrieved ` wfpc2 associations ' ; these are coadded images produced by the cadc pipeline , which combines multiple cr - split images with the gcombine task .",
    "we found that gcombine did not adequately remove cosmic - ray hits when only two images were co - added , so in that case we retrieved the individual images and combined them with crrej .",
    "there were no obvious differences in the images produced using the two methods  we used both since we became aware of availability of association images from the cadc part way into the project .",
    "once the images were processed , we began the search for star clusters .",
    "the first step was carried out ` blind ' , that is , without any knowledge of the positions of cataloged clusters .",
    "working independently , each of us visually examined each image .",
    "pb used sextractor @xcite to automatically identify objects with large areas and/or extended profiles , then visually checked the sextractor candidates ( many of these were actually bright stars ) and searched for additional candidates .",
    "jh used only visual examination of the images .",
    "bright m31 globular clusters can be visually distinguished from stars and elliptical galaxies because they appear more ` ragged ' at the edges ( being resolved into stars ) and do not have the diffraction spikes seen around bright stars .",
    "faint or small clusters are distinguished more by their image shapes  larger than the point spread function , and less smooth than a galaxy  than by resolution into stars .",
    "clusters are distinguished from h  ii regions or nebulae by the fact that the latter are much more diffuse are show few individual stars .",
    "the visual classification is not completely objective , but it was the best method we could contrive for dealing with the large number of images to be examined and the large number of potential contaminating objects .",
    "our confidence in the visual classification was bolstered by the fact that we only disagreed on the classification of about 10% of the objects .",
    "we re - examined these together to make a final classification .",
    "we combined our two lists of cluster candidates to make a final list .",
    "although we were interested primarily in globular clusters , we recorded positions of possible open clusters as well .",
    "following previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we classified our globulars in classes a through d , where a is ` very likely to be a globular cluster ' and d is ` likely not a globular cluster ' .",
    "we refer to objects in classes a and b as good candidates , and objects in classes c and d as marginal cluster candidates . after generating our final list of cluster candidates",
    ", we checked the image positions against existing catalogs of m31 globular clusters .",
    "this allowed us to gauge our detection efficiency and locate objects we would otherwise have missed .",
    "the globular cluster list used was a ` master list ' of globular clusters and candidates , produced by combining the lists of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; it includes all the objects listed in the @xcite catalog , plus additional low - probability candidates and non - clusters .",
    "we consider the low and high - probability globular clusters separately .",
    "` high probability ' are clusters a or b class clusters from @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ; all other objects are ` low probability ' .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xcite classification correlates well with the probability that a candidate will be subsequently shown to be a cluster .",
    "75 high - probability clusters from our master list were located in the hst fields ; we detected 71 , and some images of previously - cataloged clusters are shown in figure  [ fig - gc ] .",
    "three of the four non - detections ( 138000 , 166000 , and 133191 ) appeared to be stars or blends of stars rather than globular clusters ; the fourth object was dao040 and we did not detect any object at the coordinates given by @xcite . of the 72 low - probability ( class c or d ) cluster candidates in our hst fields , we found 7 good candidates ( 000d038 , 000m91 , 020d089 , 097d000 , 132 - 000 , 264nb19 , and nb39 ) , 4 marginal candidates ( 000m045 , 257000 , nb41 and nb86 ) , and 45 objects which did not appear to be clusters .",
    "we did not detect the other 14 objects in our visual search . on",
    "re - examining the positions of these objects , we found that none were good or even marginal cluster candidates .",
    "several were clearly stars , and the others were blends of stars or blank fields .",
    "table  [ tbl - noncl ] gives a list of the non - clusters and their classifications .",
    "our visual search of the hst fields produced 32 objects not included in any cluster catalog .",
    "10 of these were good candidates , although only about half are as obviously clusters as most of the brighter objects .",
    "the good candidates images are shown in figure  [ fig - newclust ] .",
    "the nature of the remaining 22 objects is unclear .",
    "they are clearly not stars ; all are at least marginally resolved ( fwhm @xmath11 )",
    ". however , most are quite faint , and they are not obviously resolved into stars as is the case for most of the globular clusters .",
    "they may be blended stars in m31 , compact background galaxies , or compact star clusters .",
    "we show images of these low - quality objects in figure  [ fig - myst ] .",
    "table  [ tbl - newgc ] gives the location and quality of all the new cluster candidates .",
    "the dividing line between open and globular clusters is somewhat blurred , even in the milky way . in their compilation of data on milky way",
    "globular clusters , @xcite note that there are several globulars ( bh  176 , uks  2 ) which could instead be open clusters . in our search , we noted several concentrated objects which could be m31 open clusters .",
    "their nature is uncertain : they could also be low - concentration globulars , or just chance superpositions of stars .",
    "their images are shown in figure  [ fig - oc ] .",
    "we checked the cluster coordinates against those given in @xcite s ( @xcite ) list of m31 open clusters .",
    "the coordinates in that catalog have rather low precision ( 20  in both right ascension and declination ) , so we searched for coordinate matches within an error circle of radius 30 .",
    "we found 5 matches and attempted to confirm these by comparing the finding charts in @xcite to our images .",
    "the results were inconclusive : either the objects were not clearly identified on the charts , or they were located too close to the edge of the hst image to make a positive identification .",
    "we note the possible matches in table  [ tbl - newgc ] .    to see if any of our newly - proposed globular and open cluster candidates had been previously cataloged as background galaxies , we checked their positions against those of galaxies listed in ned .",
    "none of the new clusters matched the position of any galaxy listed in ned , although one is listed as a possible h  ii region @xcite and two others may contain radio and x  ray sources @xcite .",
    "the matches are also noted in table  [ tbl - newgc ] .",
    "however , the matches are uncertain since positional uncertainties for the other surveys are large .",
    "figure  [ posplot ] shows the positions on the sky of all the m31 clusters , both previously - known and newly - discovered .",
    "the ` open cluster ' near ngc  205 is well outside the disk and is probably not a real cluster .",
    "after the m31 clusters had been identified on the ` search ' images , we retrieved images of their fields in other available filters to extract the most photometric information from the hst archive .",
    "all but 18 clusters had been imaged by wfpc2 in more than one filter .",
    "we combined images for cosmic - ray rejection in the same manner used for the search images .",
    "additional processing steps included removing cosmic rays interactively using the iraf task imedit ( this was especially important for non - cosmic - ray - split images ) and correcting for warm pixels using the iraf task cosmicrays . while the stsdas task warmpix is the preferred method of dealing with warm pixels , it is slow and requires correction of individual images before they are combined for cosmic ray rejection . since we had hundreds of individual images to deal with , we chose the more expedient method of treating the warm pixels as if they were as cosmic ray hits on ground - based images .",
    "nearby bright stars and ccd flaws were masked out of the images to prevent contamination of the photometry .",
    "a few images were not useful for photometry at all : the globular clusters were either very faint ( mostly in the f300w and f336w filters ) , too close to an image edge , or saturated .",
    "photometry of extragalactic globular clusters is unfortunately not as simple as photometry of isolated stars or galaxies .",
    "there are two key steps in integrated photometry of m31 clusters : measuring the background light , and identifying an appropriate aperture size .",
    "the background light consists of two components : unresolved light from the sky and m31 , and light from resolved stars in m31 ( the latter are a lesser problem in ground - based photometry of m31 gcs since many fewer m31 stars are resolved ) .",
    "standard background estimators are usually designed to determine the sky background level by rejecting the stars in the background annulus .",
    "since we expect there to be stars overlapping our clusters as well , we estimated the background value for each image as the mean ( rather than the more commonly used median or mode ) of the pixel values around the image edge , and subtracted it from the image before doing photometry .",
    "determining the ` correct ' aperture size to be used for integrated photometry is non - trivial since the clusters are not all the same size .",
    "we estimated the total flux for each object by measuring aperture magnitudes in concentric apertures spaced 0.15  apart , plotting magnitude growth curves , and noting where the flux stopped increasing . using these measurements of the total flux of each cluster , we determined the half - light radius is that which contains half of the integrated cluster light .",
    "it should not be confused with the radius at which the surface brightness drops to half of its central value , called variously the core radius @xmath12 , the half - intensity radius , or the half - width at half maximum ( hwhm ) . ] by interpolating the aperture magnitude curves .",
    "we calibrated the instrumental magnitudes from the wfpc2 system to the standard system by iteratively solving the equations given in @xcite , using the charge - transfer - efficiency corrections given by @xcite .",
    "the iterative solution of the calibration equations requires instrumental magnitudes in at least two filters ; for objects with only one instrumental magnitude , we fixed the ` standard color ' as either the measured ground - based color from @xcite , or if that was unavailable , the average m31 gc color .",
    "the results for integrated magnitudes and half - light radii are given in table  [ tbl - phot ] . in figure",
    "[ fig - photcomp ] , we compare the new hst photometry to the ground - based measurements compiled in @xcite .",
    "the agreement is gratifying : the median offset in @xmath13 is @xmath14  magnitudes , and in @xmath15 is @xmath16  mag .",
    "most of the large offsets are for objects near the edge of a wfpc2 chip , or whose previous photometry was estimated from photographic plates .",
    "to estimate the completeness of globular cluster catalogs in m31 , we first need to understand our own detection efficiency .",
    "we estimated this by inserting artificial globular clusters into the inner images , for which the distance from the center of m31 @xmath17 was less than 30 .",
    "the artificial clusters were actually images of the brightest real globular clusters we detected . to insert the artificial clusters , we scaled the image fluxes 04 magnitudes fainter , adjusted for the exposure time of the inserted image , rotated the cluster to a random position angle , and applied a random axial ratio from 0.85 to 1.0 .",
    "this may not have been an entirely correct method of generating artificial clusters , since cluster size , surface brightness , and integrated magnitude are known to be correlated for milky way clusters . however , we decided it was better not to introduce additional assumptions about the correlation of these parameters into our detection test . once an artificial cluster was inserted into a copy of each hst frame , we extracted a @xmath18  region around the inserted cluster , and examined only that portion of the image .",
    "this cut - out procedure was similar to the procedure used for the re - examination of ` problem ' images .",
    "in fact the visual examination of the two groups of images was done at the same time , with no reference to which were the inserted clusters and which were the real objects . for each cut - out image",
    ", we decided whether or not it was a _",
    "bona fide _ globular cluster .",
    "the results of our search for the inserted globular clusters are in figure  [ fig - incomp ] , where detection of each inserted cluster is indicated as a function of @xmath13 magnitude and @xmath19 .",
    "the figure shows , as expected , that our detection efficiency was generally worse for fainter objects and objects near the center of m31 .",
    "faint clusters are more difficult to find against the bright background of the m31 disk and nucleus",
    ". we also failed to detect a few bright objects , mostly in short exposures or in the near - uv filters f300w and f336w .",
    "overall , we correctly identified 80% of the inserted clusters , and 92% of the objects which appeared in long f555w and f814w exposures .",
    "the distribution of the real globular clusters and candidates detected in the hst images is shown in figure  [ fig - gcdet ] .",
    "the number of newly - detected objects increases at fainter magnitudes ; there is no clear trend in the number of new objects with @xmath19 .",
    "we use the data in figures  [ fig - incomp ]  and  [ fig - gcdet ] to estimate the completeness of existing catalogs .",
    "while it would be desirable to estimate the completeness as a joint function of magnitude and position , the small number of objects we have to work with makes deriving @xmath20 difficult .",
    "instead we summed over one variable to produce separate functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are plotted in figure  [ fig - compfn ] .",
    "the catalog completeness is computed by dividing the number of cataloged objects in a given bin by the true number of objects : @xmath23 where the ` true ' object total is the sum of the number of cataloged objects and the number of new objects divided by our detection efficiency @xmath24 .",
    "the number of new objects includes the marginal objects . from the results of @xcite , only a fraction ( @xmath25 ) of the marginal objects",
    "are likely to be true globular clusters .",
    "we therefore give a range of solutions for the completeness functions in figure  [ fig - compfn ] , corresponding to @xmath26 and 1.0 .",
    "the figure shows , as expected , that existing catalogs are reasonably complete to @xmath27 , after which the completeness drops drastically . to compute the completeness as a function of @xmath19",
    ", we assumed that detection efficiency at @xmath28  was the same as that in the @xmath29  bin .",
    "the completeness as a functions of @xmath19 does not follow any particular pattern ; the most important point is the low completeness in the innermost bin .",
    "@xmath22 can only be measured out to about @xmath30 , and averaging over this region yields values for the overall completeness of 5085% .",
    "the small number of objects per radial bin and the uncertainty about the nature of the marginal objects make this estimate rather imprecise .",
    "it is important to know the total number of globular clusters in m31 , since it is one of the few spiral galaxies with well - studied gcss .",
    "existing surveys ( summarized in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our new hst survey bring the number of confirmed m31 gcs to over 250 . the most comprehensive attempt to estimate the total number of m31 gcs @xcite gives population ratios @xmath31 ; with @xmath32 , this gives @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "we can use the results of our completeness study to attempt a new estimate of the total number of m31 gcs .",
    "we take two approaches , which use the completeness data somewhat differently .",
    "one approach is to use the result that for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the existing sample is close to complete .",
    "we can therefore use the results of gclf fitting in this region to estimate the number of clusters fainter than @xmath27 .",
    "the gclfs computed in @xcite give a total number of clusters @xmath37 in the range 394417 ; the midpoint of the range is 406 .",
    "in the region @xmath38 , there are 37 cataloged clusters or candidates and the catalog completeness is about 70% .",
    "this implies that the true number of clusters is about 53 , so the total number of gcs in m31 is approximately @xmath39 .",
    "a reasonable estimate of the error in this value is 15% , or @xmath40 .",
    "we can also use the completeness estimates directly , to estimate @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number of good and marginal cataloged clusters in a given @xmath19 bin .",
    "the @xmath44 used in the computation is the value plotted in figure  [ fig - compfn ] for the appropriate value of @xmath45 .",
    "the catalog used is that given by @xcite with likely ngc  205 clusters and ( likely young ) blue clusters removed .",
    "the 299 good clusters are those confirmed by spectroscopy or high - resolution imaging and/or members of the ` adopted best sample ' of @xcite ; the other 130 clusters are considered marginal .",
    "the resulting @xmath37 is sensitive to the value of @xmath45 and ranges from @xmath46 for @xmath47 to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "a value of @xmath50 , which we believe is reasonable , gives @xmath51 .",
    "our two estimates of the total number of gcs in m31 are compatible both with each other and with the results of @xcite .",
    "the precision of our results is not much better than that of previous estimates , and improvement will require a wide - field , deep ccd survey of m31 which can be used to find gcs in a uniform manner across the galaxy ; such a survey is currently being carried out @xcite .",
    "we now consider implications of our estimated value of m31 s @xmath37 for its specific frequency @xmath52 and ` mass specific frequency ' @xmath53 @xcite . to do this we need values for m31 s luminosity and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "@xcite gives the total magnitude of m31 as @xmath54 .",
    "correcting for foreground extinction @xmath55 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our adopted value of @xmath8 gives @xmath56 , which is bracketed by the values given by @xcite , @xmath57 , and @xcite , @xmath58 .",
    "for ease of comparison we use @xmath59 as do @xcite . with @xmath60 ,",
    "this gives @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "sa and sab spirals the ( highly uncertain ) mean values are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "m31 s values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 fall at the large end of the range of observed values for sb and sc spirals , and well within the range observed for sa and sab spirals .",
    "while it has about twice as many clusters per unit mass or luminosity than the milky way , m31 is within the range of variation seen in other spirals gcss .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on the difference between the milky way in m31 in terms of differences in the two galaxies histories , since obviously environmental differences can not be a major player .",
    "@xcite suggested that perhaps m31 suffered an early major merger ; perhaps this was responsible for the creation of extra gcs in m31 , as in the picture of @xcite .",
    "this would be consistent with the suggestion that some of the metal - rich gcs in m31 are younger than the rest of the population @xcite , although there are not enough metal - rich clusters to account for the entire ` cluster excess ' in m31 .",
    "further explanation of the total number of clusters in m31 awaits both a larger spiral comparison sample and more detailed theoretical picture of gcs formation .",
    "using the hubble space telescope archive to search for m31 globular clusters in wfpc2 images , we present the discovery of many previously - known clusters , a number of new cluster candidates , and some 20 objects which may be m31 open clusters .",
    "we use the discovery data , together with an estimate of our discovery efficiency , to estimate the completeness of existing cluster catalogs .",
    "as expected , the existing catalogs are least complete for faint clusters and clusters very near the center of m31 . as we found in a preliminary version of this analysis in @xcite ,",
    "the completeness is very high to the magnitude limit we used for computing the globular cluster luminosity function .",
    "this validates our finding that the m31 gclf varies with both radial distance from the center of m31 and with metallicity .",
