    "worldwide , major efforts are made to realise systems for the storage of individual quantum bits ( qubits ) and to conditionally couple different qubits for the processing of quantum information @xcite .",
    "ultra - cold trapped neutral atoms or ions are ideal quantum memories that store qubits in long - lived states , while single photons may act as flying qubits that allow for linear optical quantum computing @xcite . on the route to a scalable quantum - computing network ,",
    "interconverting these stationary and flying qubits is essential @xcite .",
    "one way to accomplish such an interface is by an adiabatic coupling between a single atom and a single photon in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the present work focusses on the properties of a coupled atom - cavity system which is operated as a single - photon emitter @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other methods of fock - state preparation in the microwave regime @xcite , where the photons remain trapped inside the cavity , our scheme allows one to emit single optical photons on demand into a well - defined mode of the radiation field outside the cavity@xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to many other single - photon sources , like solid - state systems @xcite , our source operates under non - stationary conditions , because atoms enter and leave the cavity randomly . only during",
    "the presence of a single atom , the atom - cavity system is acting as a single - photon emitter .",
    "no photons are generated without atoms , and if more than one atom is present , the number of simultaneously emitted photons might exceed one .",
    "these circumstances have a significant impact on the photon statistics of the emitted light @xcite , which is analysed here in detail .",
    "the atomic states labelled @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are involved in the raman process , and the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the photon number in the cavity .",
    "* right : * setup : a cloud of atoms is released from a magneto - optical trap and falls through a cavity @xmath5 cm below in about @xmath6ms with a velocity of @xmath7 m/s .",
    "the interaction time of each atom in the cloud with the tem@xmath8 mode of the cavity amounts to about @xmath9s .",
    "the pump and recycling lasers are collinear and overlap with the cavity mode . the light emitted from the cavity is registered by a pair of photo diodes in hanbury - brown & twiss configuration in order to analyse the photon statistics . ]",
    "figure [ setup ] illustrates the basic scheme of the process .",
    "a dilute cloud of @xmath10rb atoms , prepared in state @xmath11 , is released from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and falls with a velocity of @xmath7 m/s through a 1 mm long optical cavity of finesse @xmath12 .",
    "the density of the cloud , and therefore the average number of atoms simultaneously interacting with the tem@xmath8 mode of the cavity , is freely adjustable .",
    "the cavity is near resonant with the transition between the @xmath13 hyperfine state of the electronic ground state and the electronically excited @xmath14 state , labelled @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "initially , the cavity is empty , so that the state of the coupled atom - cavity system can only move within the hilbert space spanned by the product states @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 denoting the relevant photon number states of the cavity .",
    "the dynamics of this system is determined by @xmath23mhz , where @xmath24 is the cavity - induced coupling between states @xmath18 and @xmath19 for an atom optimally coupled to the cavity , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the field and polarisation decay rates of the cavity and the atom , respectively , and @xmath27 is the detuning of the cavity from the atomic transition .",
    "one mirror has a larger transmission coefficient than the other so that photons leave the cavity through this output coupler with a probability of 90% . while an atom interacts with the cavity , it experiences a sequence of laser pulses that alternate between triggering single - photon emissions and recycling the atom to state @xmath28 : the @xmath29s long pump pulses are detuned by @xmath27 from the @xmath30 transition , so that they adiabatically drive a stimulated raman transition ( stirap ) @xcite from @xmath17 to @xmath19 with a rabi frequency that increases linearly from 0 to @xmath31mhz .",
    "this raman transition goes hand - in - hand with a photon emission .",
    "once the photon is emitted , the system reaches @xmath32 , which is not coupled to the single - excitation manifold , @xmath33 , and therefore can not be re - excited .",
    "this limits the number of photons per pump pulse and atom to one .    to emit a sequence of photons from one - and - the - same atom ,",
    "the system is transferred back to @xmath34 after each emission .",
    "to do so , we apply @xmath29s long recycling laser pulses that hit the atom between consecutive pump pulses .",
    "the recycling pulses are resonant with the @xmath35 transition and excite the atom to state @xmath36 .",
    "from there , it decays spontaneously to the initial state , @xmath37 . in this way ,",
    "an atom that resides in the cavity can emit a sequence of single - photon pulses .",
    "for each experimental cycle , these photons are recorded using two avalanche photo diodes with 50% quantum efficiency , which are placed at the output ports of a beam splitter .",
    "the two photo diodes constitute a hanbury - brown & twiss setup @xcite which we use to measure the normalised intensity correlation of the photon stream emitted from the cavity , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the count rate recorded by detector @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 denotes the mean count rate recorded by each detector and @xmath42 is the mean noise - count rate , the mean rate of photon - counts reads @xmath43 .",
    "this allows to estimate two of the three following contributions to the correlation function : +    * correlations between a noise count and either a real photon or another noise count are randomly distributed and occur with a probability proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "therefore these correlations lead to a constant background contribution , @xmath45 to the normalised correlation function .",
    "* correlations between photons that stem from different atoms lead to a modulation of @xmath46 , since the periodicity of the pump laser leads to a modulation of the photon emission probability .",
    "the pump intervals have the same duration as the recycling intervals , and the probability for photon emissions during recycling is close to zero .",
    "this increases the average rate of photons emitted during pumping to @xmath47 , so that photon - photon correlations between pump pulses are found with a probability proportional to @xmath48 , while the probability to get photon correlations between pump- and recycling intervals is vanishingly small .",
    "the average normalised contribution of photon - photon correlations to @xmath49 therefore oscillates between @xmath50 in order to obtain this simple estimation , we use the factor @xmath51 in @xmath52 to take into account that photons are emitted only during pump pulses , which are active half of the time , and we neglect any time - dependence of @xmath53 within the pump pulses . in the experiment , however , @xmath53 varies with time , which causes small deviations from the estimated values , as further discussed below .",
    "+ , with different - atom ( hatched ) and noise ( cross - hatched ) contributions . for correlation times larger than the atom - cavity interaction time , only these contributions persist .",
    "they are calculated by a convolution of the respective pulse - averaged count rates , @xmath54 , which are shown in the two insets . *",
    "( a ) * high atom flux , averaged over 4997 experimental cycles ( loading and releasing of the atom cloud ) with a total number of 151089 photon counts . * ( b ) * low atom flux , averaged over 15000 experimental cycles with a total number of 184868 photon counts . ]",
    "* correlations between photons emitted from one - and - the - same atom are , of course , most interesting .",
    "they can not be estimated from the average count rates , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . however , due to the limited atom - cavity interaction time , @xmath55 , it is clear that they only contribute to @xmath46 in the time interval @xmath56 $ ] , and therefore this contribution can be distinguished from * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * as explained below .",
    "figure [ g2-unconditional](a and b ) , obtained for a different flux of atoms , shows that the three contributions above are easily identified in the measured correlation function . due to the limited atom - cavity interaction time , all correlations with @xmath57 either belong to category * ( a ) * or * ( b)*. the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath46 in this regime stems from photons emitted by different atoms , whereas the time - independent pedestal is mainly caused by correlations involving noise counts .",
    "these two contributions are indicated as hatched and cross - hatched areas , respectively .",
    "they were calculated by a convolution of the pulse - averaged count rate , @xmath58 , with a total number of @xmath59 recorded pump&recycle intervals of duration @xmath60s .",
    "this gives an oscillation of the intensity correlation function between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these two values of @xmath49 can also be estimated from the mean count rates , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this estimation predicts an oscillation of @xmath49 with the periodicity of the applied sequence between the two extrema @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the data underlying fig.[g2-unconditional ] , we obtain the following result :    [ cols=\">,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as mentioned above , the estimated values deviate slightly from the values obtained from the convolution of the pulse - averaged count rate .",
    "this was expected due to the simplified model our estimation is based on . note that contributions * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * persist also in the regime @xmath65 , since the atoms have a poissonian distribution .",
    "obviously , the excess signal observed here belongs to category * ( c ) * , i.e. it reflects the single - atom contribution to the correlation signal .",
    "most remarkably , no excess signal is found around @xmath66 , i.e.  all correlations registered during one - and - the - same pump pulse either involve noise counts or photons from different atoms .",
    "correlations between photons that stem from one - and - the - same atom * ( c ) * are only found between different pump pulses . moreover , antibunching with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , is observed .",
    "this effect can not be observed for a classical light source , where the cauchy - schwartz inequality predicts that @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "therefore the observation of antibunching indicates that a single atom emits photons one - by - one .        ,",
    "conditioned on the presence of atoms in the cavity .",
    "data are shown for high atom flux * ( a ) * and low atom flux * ( b ) * as stated in fig.[g2-unconditional ] . ]    in case of a stationary single - photon source , the non - classicality of the emitted radiation would lead to a sub - poissonian photon statistics with @xmath70 . in the present case , however , atoms arrive randomly in the cavity , and the poissonian atom statistics leads to @xmath71 . an a - priori knowledge on the presence of an atom is therefore needed to operate the apparatus as a single - photon emitter . indeed , if the statistical analysis of the emitted photon stream is restricted to time intervals where the presence of an atom in the cavity is assured with very high probability , a sub - poissonian photon statistics is found .",
    "figure [ conditioning ] illustrates the conditioning scheme : to detect an atom , we rely on the fact that photons are only emitted while an atom resides in the cavity .",
    "thus a photon that is detected during a pump pulse signals the presence of an atom with probability @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the mean number of noise counts per pump pulse counted by both detectors , and @xmath74 is the mean number of detected photons per pulse , with @xmath75s being the pulse duration .",
    "for the data underlying fig.[g2-unconditional ] , we obtain @xmath76 and @xmath77 for high and low atom flux , respectively . the small value of @xmath78 is due to the fact that the cavity contains no atom most of the time .",
    "but once an atom is detected , it moves only 1/5 of the cavity waist until the next pump pulse arrives .",
    "we can therefore safely assume that the atom still resides in the cavity at that moment . in the statistical analysis of the light emitted from the system",
    ", we now include only the time interval corresponding to this next pump pulse .",
    "this is accomplished by first denoting the numbers , @xmath79 , of the @xmath80 pump intervals with @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the number of photons detected in the @xmath83th interval .",
    "the time intervals of the adjacent pump pulses then form the new stream of selected data , where the number of photons counted with detector 1 and 2 , respectively , is given by @xmath84 . from this , the conditioned correlation function , @xmath85 shown in fig .",
    "[ g2-conditional ] , is calculated . in case of a small average atom number ,",
    "see fig.[g2-conditional](b ) , conditioning yields @xmath86 , which is well below one .",
    "if the atom flux is increased , fig.[g2-conditional](a ) , one obtains @xmath87 .",
    "obviously the larger value is due to the fact that the probability of having more than one atom interacting with the cavity is not negligible .",
    "nevertheless , the photon statistics conditioned on the presence of atoms is sub - poissonian in both cases , which is demonstrating a noise reduction below the shot - noise level .",
    "note that the errors in @xmath88 are derived from the standard deviations , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes the number of events that constitute @xmath88 prior to normalisation .",
    "we count @xmath91 and @xmath92 events , whereas for @xmath93 , we count , on average , @xmath94 and 130 events with @xmath95 and 11.4 , which yields @xmath96 and 1.00(9 ) , for low and high atom flux , respectively",
    ". the fluctuations of @xmath97 in fig.[g2-conditional ] are well explained by this shot noise .    .",
    "the theoretical expectation values are represented by the green dashed bars , while the experimentally found probabilities are indicated by the solid blue bars .",
    "data are shown for high atom flux * ( a ) * and low atom flux * ( b ) * as stated in fig.[g2-unconditional ] .",
    "the decrease of the experimentally observed probabilities in * ( b ) * as compared to * ( a ) * is attributed to a small misalignment of the setup for low atom flux . ]    from the recorded stream of events , we can also characterise the efficiency of the photon source by evaluating the probability for the conditional emission of photons during the pump pulses that follow the detection of an atom by a first photodetection ( fig.[following - pulses ] ) .",
    "the evaluation must encompass a correction for detector effects like noise counts and reduced quantum efficiencies .",
    "hence , we take into account that a single photodetection actually signals the presence of an atom only with probability @xmath98 , and we also consider that the following photons are detected with an overall quantum efficiency of @xmath99 ( photo diodes and spatial filtering ) .",
    "we then use the @xmath80 pump intervals with @xmath81 as starting points to calculate the average photo - emission probabilities during the neighbouring pulses , @xmath100 .",
    "\\label{pdelta}\\ ] ] here , @xmath101 is the total number of events counted by both detectors during the @xmath102th pump pulse .",
    "the mean number of noise counts per pulse , @xmath103 , and the mean number of photons per pulse , @xmath78 , are subtracted from each count number to ensure that only photons emitted from one - and - the same atom are considered .",
    "we also correct for false triggers , i.e. noise counts signalling atoms which are not present , and the quantum efficiency of the photodetection .",
    "note that the @xmath80 conditioning photodetections are not counted twice , since we subtract @xmath104 from the calculated probabilities , with @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 otherwise .",
    "obviously , the probabilities for subsequent photon emissions decrease from pulse - to - pulse , since the efficiency of the photon generation depends on the location of the moving atom .",
    "it is highest in an anti - node on the cavity axis and decreases if the atom moves away from this point .",
    "a simulation of the process , based on a numerical solution of the master equation , allows the calculation of the expected photon - emission probabilities averaged over the random trajectories of the atoms travelling through the cavity .",
    "this leads to the same qualitative results , but the experimentally determined emission probabilities are smaller than the expected ones .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the random distribution of the atom among its magnetic sublevels after recycling , which reduces the overall efficiency of the photon generation . in our numerical simulation , this has been neglected .",
    "a more rigourous analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another significant feature of the numerical analysis is the prediction of a single - photon generation efficiency of @xmath108 for an atom which is optimally coupled to the cavity .",
    "therefore we expect that the present scheme is able to produce single photons in a highly efficient way provided the atom is hold at rest by , e.g. , a dipole - force trap @xcite .",
    "we have statistically analysed the photon stream emitted from a strongly coupled atom - cavity system in response to laser pulses that adiabatically drive raman transitions between two atomic states .",
    "the laser pulses excite one branch of the transition , while the vacuum field of the cavity stimulates the other branch .",
    "the cavity operates as a non - stationary single - photon source , since the atoms enter and leave the mode volume randomly , with a maximum number of about 7 successive photon emissions per atom . without any a - priori knowledge on the state of the system , antibunching is observed , which indicates that a single atom emits photons one - by - one .",
    "furthermore , a preselection has been applied to restrict the analysis to time intervals where the presence of an atom is assured .",
    "this gives a sub - poissonian photon statistics with @xmath70 .",
    "our setup therefore operates as a deterministic single - photon emitter , although the atom statistics is poissonian .",
