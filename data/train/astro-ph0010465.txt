    "the discovery of periodic ( @xmath050 min ) dips in the x - ray flux from the moderately faint source 4u1915 - 05 ( x1916 - 053 ) provided the first direct evidence for a binary periodicity in an x - ray burst source ( walter et al 1982 , white and swank 1982 ) .",
    "combined with the general success of the thermonuclear flash model for ( type i ) x - ray bursts ( e.g. joss and li 1980 ) , this confirmed that bursters are indeed neutron stars accreting from binary companions .",
    "the x - ray dips are believed to be caused by partial occultation by vertical structure ( or clouds ) in the accretion disk . the short dip period ( @xmath03000 sec ) , if identified as the binary period , provided the the first example of an ultra - compact x - ray binary with a very low mass degenerate companion .    the x - ray period has been reported with values from 2985 to 3015 sec ( walter et al .",

    "in addition to the primary dips , secondary dips with phase difference @xmath6 are sometimes observed .",
    "the varieties of dip width , depth , phase , and association with the period show the complex behavior of x1916 - 053 .",
    "in addition to the 3000sec dip period , a 199d long - term x - ray modulation period was also reported by priedhorsky and terrell ( 1984 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of x1916 - 053 was discovered ( grindlay et al . 1988 ) as a v=21 mag optical star with a modulation period of 3027.5 sec , @xmath7 longer than the x - ray dip period .",
    "the difference between the x - ray and optical periods leads to the question of which represents the orbital period of the system .",
    "the optical period was found to be stable over ( at least ) 7 years ( callanan , grindlay and cool , 1995 , hereafter cgc95 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly introduce su uma vs. triple system models previously suggested ( grindlay , 1992 ) for explaining the x - ray / optical period difference ( section 2 ) , describe our 1996 rxte observations of x1916 - 053 ( section 3 ) and report ( section 4 ) the timing analysis of the data , including the x - ray dip periodicity , @xmath0 3.9d period dip shape modulation , the dip phase jitter phenomenon , and the long term x - ray dip period stability from the combination of the rxte and previous x - ray observations ( einstein ( 1979 - 1981 ) , exosat ( 1983 ) and ginga ( 1987 - 1990 ) ) .",
    "analysis of our optical may 14 - 23 , 1996 , optical observations quasi - simultaneous with rxte and historical ( 1987 - 96 ) optical data are used to derive the optical ephemeris and phase jitter for comparison with the x - ray values .",
    "we use the x - ray dip ephemeris , which is able to predict dip times within 0.1 phase ( 300sec ) back to 1979 , to study the relation of the times of x - ray bursts to dips since a possible correlation was previously noted ( grindlay 1992 ) . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss su uma vs. triple models for the complex light curve behavior of x1916 - 053 , concluding that either model would require interesting new phenomena to explain the present data but that the triple model would be required if the dip - burst correlation is real .",
    "grindlay ( 1989 , 1992 ) pointed out that two models might account for the the beat behavior and the @xmath01% difference of the optical and the x - ray periods .",
    "the dual periods suggest either a su uma type precession or a triple system .",
    "su uma binaries are a subclass of dwarf novae , which during their superoutburst state , display `` superhumps '' with periods a few percent longer than the orbital period ( see , e.g. , warner 1995 ) .",
    "similar @xmath01% longer periods are formed in the optical outbursts of x - ray transients . for both su uma dwarf novae and x - ray transients ,",
    "the binary period is the shorter of the two , and the longer period ( which changes during outburst decay ) is the beat between the binary and a longer disk precession period .",
    "applied to x1916 - 053 , the shorter x - ray dip period would be the binary period .",
    "whitehurst ( 1988 ) has discovered by hydrodynamic simulation that an accretion disk in a cv system with a low - mass secondary is tidally unstable and leads to a precessing eccentric disk .",
    "hirose and osaki ( 1990 ) have derived the dependence of the disk precession period on binary mass ratio which we apply to x1916 - 053 in section 5.1 .    the triple model for x1916 - 053 was proposed by grindlay et al .",

    "mazeh and shaham ( 1979 ) showed that in a hierarchical triple system , the eccentricity of the inner binary is modulated at a long - term period @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to the binary period and the orbital period of the third companion and k is a constant of order unity which depends on mass ratios and relative inclinations . under the triple model , the third companion period ( @xmath04d ) in the x1916 - 053 system",
    "should be the beat period of the x - ray dip period and the optical period .",
    "x - ray dips are due to mass transfer `` surges '' , from the change in inner binary eccentricity induced by third star at the period given by the beat between the outer and inner orbital periods . if the optical period , the longer one , is the binary period , then this triple companion is in a retrograde orbit and the constant k=0.46 for x1916 - 053 system .",
    "this model also predicts that the x - ray dips should display phase glitches ( bailyn 1987 ) and a timing correlation between x - ray dips and x - ray bursts ( grindlay 1992 , and see section 4.4 ) .",

    "a reference star close ( @xmath12 arcmin ) to x1916 - 053 and within @xmath01 mag was used to measure the total measurement errors of the observation .",
    "some data are not included in the analysis because of the large fluctuation in the comparison star . only five nights observations ( ut may 15 , 16 , 20 , 21 and 23 ) have good light curves for analysis .",
    "a typical optical light curve is shown in figure  [ tyoplc ] .",
    "we first describe a period folding analysis for an initial determination of the x - ray dip period .",
    "this is then refined , and limits on @xmath13 are derived from the phase analysis .",
    "we then apply a similar analysis for the optical data and derive , similarly , a long - term ephemeris .",
    "finally , we use the dip ephemeris to examine the dip phase of x - ray bursts detected from x1916 - 053 .",
    "all data were initially corrected for arrival times at the solar system barycenter .",
    "we first carried out a @xmath14 analysis of the folding light curves ( 32 bins ) to search for the best period of x1916 - 053 dips near 3000 sec for the entire 1996 rxte data .",
    "the maximum @xmath14 is at 3000.6 sec as shown in figure  [ fesall ] .",
    "fitting the 3000.6 sec peak with a gaussian gave the best period of 3000.625 @xmath1 0.192 sec .",
    "the side bands are mainly the results of the beat period of observation gaps .    performing the same @xmath14 analysis on the ten consecutive observations in may , we find that there is a family of peaks , in addition to the 3000 sec peak , including a @xmath15 sec peak near the 3027 sec optical variation period .",
    "the centroid of these peaks associated with the 3000 sec period implies that there is a modulation with a fundamental period of @xmath03.9 days , as previously noticed ( grindlay 1992 ) , in the x1916 - 053 x - ray light curves ( see figure  [ fesmay ] ) .",
    "if we take the modulation period to be the 3.9087d beat period of the optical period ( 3027.5510 sec ; cf .",
    "section 4.3 ) and the x - ray dip period ( 3000.6508 sec ; cf . section 4.2 ) respectively , we may then define the x - ray side band periods as    @xmath16 where @xmath17=3000.6508 sec , @xmath18=3.9087d , n= @xmath11,@xmath12 ..... and @xmath18/n is the nth harmonic of the modulation period .",
    "table 2 shows the expected side band periods and the measured side band periods .",
    "to further study the origin of the @xmath0 3.9d beat period , we folded the light curves with the folding period of 3000.625 sec for each of ten consecutive days .",
    "the daily folded light curves are grouped into 4 day groups in figure  [ tenfef ] to demonstrate the light curve variations .",
    "the @xmath03.9d period is evident as variations in dip shape , especially duration . in figure",
    "[ tenfef ] , the first column ( may 14 , 18 and 22 ) has the largest dip widths , and the width narrowed in the following 3 days ( except may 15 when , surprisingly , no dip was observed ) .",
    "the second row ( may 18 to 21 ) of the plot shows a complete period of the width variations . on the last day of each cycle",
    "( may 17 and 21 ) , the secondary dips appear so that these are also tied to the @xmath03.9d clock .",
    "the dip depths also have a variation period of @xmath03.9d ( see figure  [ tenfef ] ) but the change is not as significant as the variation in the dip widths .",
    "schmidtke ( 1988 ) reported two possible optical periods of 2924.76 @xmath1 2.1 sec and 3027.48 @xmath1 2.2 sec in observations from the ctio 1.5 m telescope on ut 1987 may 3 , 4 , 5 and 8 .",
    "table 2 suggests that the 2924.76sec period is probably an observation of the harmonic index -3 side band .",
    "grindlay ( 1989 and 1992 ) reported that the x - ray period was found in the optical light curves also . together with the side bands and",
    "dip width - intensity modulation , we now find in the rxte x - ray light curves , the reality of a stable @xmath0 3.9d period in the x1916 - 053 system is now established .",
    "we use the phase of the dip center time folded by a trial ephemeris to refine the dip period , measure the phase variations , update the ephemeris and derive the period derivative . the dip center time is obtained from fitting a quadratic curve around the minimum of the dip and then folding it with a trial period and an arbitrary but fixed start epoch as the phase zero .",
    "the phase analysis can be used as an independent means to determine the best fit period in addition to the folding light curve analysis in section 4.1 .",
    "the first trial period may be taken arbitrarily but must be close to the true period so that there is no cycle count ambiguity for neighboring observations .",
    "we choose the period from a @xmath14 analysis of all 1996 light curves to be the initial trial period .",
    "the slope of the linear fit of the phase @xmath19 and dip center time for the data obtained over time interval t gives the correction of the period as    @xmath20    we repeat the correction process until the phase drift rate ( i.e. the slope ) is much smaller than the error of the slope of the linear fit .",
    "similar to the period correction , the error of the period is derived from the error of the fit slope . for the rxte 1996 february to october data set ,",
    "the best period from a linear fit is 3000.625 @xmath1 0.02 sec ( see figure  [ phase96 ] ) and the rxte x - ray dip ephemeris can be written as    @xmath21    to further improve the accuracy of the x - ray dip period as well as to study the long term stability of x1916 - 053 period , we analyzed historical data .",
    "first , we folded the dip center times of ginga 87 , 88 , and 90 observations ( cf .",
    "yoshida et al 1995 ) with eq.(3 ) . together with the rxte observations , we found a phase drift with a constant rate , which implies that a constant period can phase all the 1987 - 1996 data .",
    "the period error of 0.02 sec in eq.(3 ) is equivalent to a phase error of 0.07 per year .",
    "the probability of cycle count ambiguity can be written as ( assuming the distribution is gaussian )    @xmath22   d \\phi\\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    the 0.07 phase error per year gives the probabilities of cycle count ambiguities 0.007 , 0.027 and 0.199 for the 87 to 88 , 88 to 90 and 90 to 96 data , respectively .",
    "we divide the rxte observations into two parts , the first and the second halves of 1996 .",
    "together with the ginga 87 , 88 and 90 observations , we have a total of 5 data sets ( all , of course , corrected to the barycenter ) .",
    "we take the average phase to be the mean phase of each dataset and assign the mean phase fluctuation to be the error of the phase .",
    "the linear fit for the ginga - rxte data refines the dip period to be p = 3000.6508@xmath10.0021 sec .",
    "next , we add the einstein 79-81 data ( walter et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and white and swank ( 1982 ) ) and exosat 83 data ( smale et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ) , again all barycenter corrected , and fold with the 3000.6508 sec period and the ephemeris of eq.(3 ) . in the exosat data sets , folding the dip center times with the ephemeris above to the 1985 may and october data ( 3 dips ) yields phase of @xmath23 . thus these are secondary dips and are excluded from further analysis . we assign a @xmath24 phase error from the phase jitter range to each dataset .",
    "the x - ray ephemeris can phase all of the 1979 - 1996 dataset within a phase error of @xmath25 with no clear systematic derivative .",
    "the linear fit result shows that the phase drift rate is @xmath26 per day , which is smaller than the phase drift error @xmath27 per day ( 1@xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , no period correction is necessary for the x - ray ephemeris and the best fit x - ray dip ephemeris ( hereafter , the x - ray ephemeris ) is :    @xmath28 the quadratic fit of @xmath19 vs. t gives the period derivative because    @xmath29    thus , the phase can be written as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the folding period , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants .",
    "the x1916 - 053 x - ray dip period derivative from a quadratic fit for all 1979 - 1996 data sets is    @xmath35    the minimum @xmath36 fit gives @xmath37 values of 2.00 and 1.64 and a reduced @xmath38 of 0.286 and 0.274 for linear and quadratic fits , respectively . from the one",
    "sided f - test , we obtain @xmath39 in the comparison of linear and quadratic fits . thus the quadratic fit , shown in figure 7 , is not significantly better than the linear fit . we derive a 2@xmath2 ( 90% ) confidence level upper limit for any change in the x - ray dip period as @xmath40 .",
    "when the dip centers of the rxte 1996 may data are folded by the x - ray ephemeris ( shown in figure  [ jitter ] ) , a phase systematic variation is clearly seen on the time vs. phase plot . in the rxte 1996",
    "may observations , the phases form two groups . the dips from may 16 , 17 and 21 have phases larger than 0 and all the others ( except may 15 , with missing dips ) smaller than 0 .",
    "the range of the phase jitter is about @xmath1 0.05 in phase .",
    "the phase jitter seems to have some correlation with the 3.9d period .",
    "we fit a 50% duty cycle square wave with fixed 3.9087d period ( the beat period of x - ray and optical periods ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath36 fit result is shown as figure  [ jitter ] and the reduced @xmath14 is 0.45 for 19 degrees of freedom .",
    "yoshida ( 1993 ) and yoshida et al.(1995 ) fit the dip phase variation with a sinusoidal period @xmath41d from ginga 1990 september observations , so we did a similar analysis for the rxte 1996 may observations .",
    "there are two ( local ) @xmath14 minima between the periods of 3.0d to 7.0d , @xmath42d and @xmath43d , with amplitudes of @xmath44 phase ( or @xmath03 min ) and reduced @xmath14s 0.49 and 0.60 , respectively ( 17 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "both fits are good . however , although the @xmath43 d period result has slightly larger reduced @xmath14 , it is consistent with the 3.9d phase jitter , or the dip width modulation period .",
    "the sinusoidal fit with fixed period of 3.9087d gives a reduced @xmath14 of 0.69 ( 18 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "all the fit results are shown in figure  [ jitter ] .",
    "thus the 3.9d period found for the dip phase modulation with rxte is also within @xmath45 of 0.5 the ginga period ( since 3.9 @xmath0 0.5(6.5 + 1.1 ) ) .",
    "the stability of the optical modulation period is critical for us to decide which model best describes the x1916 - 053 system .",
    "the optical period was confirmed by cgc95 to be stable over 7 years and the times of minima can be described by a simple ephemeris .",
    "we have now found the x - ray period to be stable for @xmath0 17 years ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "both periods have comparable long - term stability with significantly different period values .",
    "however , in the long - term stability analysis in grindlay ( 1989 ) , cgc95 and section 4 of this paper , the minimum phases are averaged over several days to several months .",
    "those long - term analyses ignore the short - term phase fluctuations ( say , several days ) .",
    "figure  [ phstat ] shows the x1916 - 053 phase distribution of both x - ray and optical 1987 - 1996 observations folded by the corresponding ephemerides for x - ray ( eq . ( 5 ) ) and optical ( from cgc95 ) data respectively .",
    "the mean phase of the x - ray dips is 0.00098 with 1 @xmath2 fluctuation of 0.06 , and none of the 101 dips exceeds phase @xmath1 0.2 .",
    "on the other hand , the optical minima have a mean phase of 0.0573 and 1 @xmath2 fluctuation of 0.151 using the cgc95 optical ephemeris .",
    "this shows that the optical minima have larger fluctuations than the x - ray dips .",
    "the @xmath0 0.05 offset in the optical minima phases is correction of the phase zero epoch given by cgc95 that is required to fit the 1996 optical data .    with the new dataset of 1996 observations , the long - term stability of x1916 - 053 optical modulation can be tested again .",
    "we folded the light curves by the optical ephemeris from cgc95 for each night s observation to obtain the minimum phase of the night .",
    "the same method described in section 4.2 is applied to get the average minimum phases and the average observation times for each dataset .",
    "we assigned 0.15 phase error obtained from the mean fluctuations in phase to each dataset .",
    "the linear fit shows that the optical ephemeris results in a phase drift of @xmath46 per day with 1@xmath2 error of @xmath47 per day .",
    "correction of the period from cgc95 is unnecessary because the phase drift is less than the error .",
    "the linear fit demonstrates that the ephemeris in cgc95 is still good but we have obtained a smaller error of the period at @xmath48 sec (= @xmath49d ) than the one in cgc95 ( = @xmath50 ) . incorporating the 0.05 phase offset ,",
    "we derive the final x1916 - 053 optical ephemeris    @xmath51    from the quadratic fit , we obtain a period derivative of    @xmath52    which could be @xmath014 times larger than that from the x - ray dips but again is not a significant detection of @xmath53 .",
    "both linear and quadratic fits yielded good fits with small reduced @xmath54 values of 0.169 and 0.106 respectively .",
    "the f value of the one - side f - test is 6.3 for comparison of the linear fit and the quadratic fit .",
    "this value implies that the quadratic fit , as shown in figure  [ qfitop ] . , is better than the linear fit at the @xmath095% confidence level .",
    "the 2@xmath2 ( 90% ) confidence level upper limit for the change in optical period is @xmath55      grindlay et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and grindlay(1989,1992 ) proposed a triple model in which the third star period was related to the beat period of optical and x - ray periods ( @xmath0 3.9d ) . in a hierarchical triple , the predicted ( bailyn 1987 )",
    "phase of the minima of the inner binary separation , and thus ( potentially ) the mass transfer rate @xmath56 would be modulated at the beat between the outer ( @xmath57 ) and inner binary ( 3000 sec ) periods .",
    "the x - ray dips are due to these @xmath56 modulations which `` puff up '' the accretion ring ( where the accretion stream strikes the inner disk ) .",
    "so that dips do not occur at a preferential inner binary phase .",
    "bailyn ( 1987 ) shows that the phase of the inner binary separation should `` glitch '' twice per outer orbit , so we expect corresponding phase jumps in x - ray dip times . indeed",
    "the possible square wave modulation of x - ray dip phase ( figure  [ jitter ] ) is suggestive .",
    "however , the observed dip phase modulation is about a constant x - ray dip period , whereas the phase glitches expected ( bailyn 1987 ) in the inner binary separation and thus dip times are additive : they effectively delay the times of dips so that over the outer orbit period there are as many total minima ( dips ) as there are inner binary orbits .",
    "thus the x - ray dip phase should not depart from the binary phase by more than 0.5 ( depending on the `` glitch spacing ratio '' , in turn dependent on outer vs. inner binary mass ratio ) . on the other hand , if the x - ray and optical clocks are independent , their relative phase offsets ( on either the x - ray or optical ephemeris ) will be randomly spaced .",
    "thus , the free running x - ray and optical phases folded by the `` wrong '' period ( e.g. , folding the optical minima with x - ray ephemeris or folding the x - ray dips with optical ephemeris ) , will make the phase offsets drift linearly .",
    "if the observation times are random , the phase difference will be random and give rise to a uniform ( with certain statistical fluctuation ) dip ( or minimum ) phase difference distribution .",
    "grindlay ( 1992 ) found marginal evidence from the 1990 ginga and optical data for correlated optical minima vs. x - ray dips .",
    "we therefore analyzed the phase difference of the simultaneously - observed optical minima and x - ray dips .",
    "a total of 12 pairs of ( x - ray and optical ) dips / minima in the 87-96 datasets ( 9 primary and 3 secondary dips / minima ) have dip - center / minimum time differences less than 1500 sec and can thus be compared in phase for the same binary orbit .",
    "figure  [ dphstat ] shows the phase difference distribution of these quasi - simultaneous dips / minima . doing a simple @xmath54 analysis for phase differences gives a reduced @xmath54 of 1 when folded by either the x - ray or optical ephemeris .",
    "both phase differences are thus consistent with a uniform distribution .",
    "interestingly , though , the 3 secondary x - ray dips are clustered in a somewhat narrow phase range ( -0.1  + 0.3 ) ; clearly a larger sample is needed .",
    "the triple model makes one other prediction ( grindlay 1992 ) : that there may be an association between x - ray dips and x - ray bursts .",
    "this is because each accretion surge ( resulting in a dip ) , occurring at the dip period of successive minimum separation times , enhances the probability of a nuclear flash at times just following .",
    "the dip , due to obscuration by enhanced material and clumps in the accretion ring , precedes the flash by the timescale required for it to accrete from the ring onto the ns .",
    "this must be small , since the mean height of the ring must decay promptly ( in the triple model ) for the dips to have their observed typical duration of 0.1 - 0.2 phase .",
    "this then suggests the ring empties out , and accretes , via an adaf flow ( narayan and yi 1995 ) since the viscous timescale for accretion in a thin disk from the ring at r 10@xmath58 cm in this ultra - compact lmxb would still be @xmath593000 sec , or at least a full binary period .",
    "therefore if accretion onto the ns is enhanced by the rapid decay of the ring , perhaps through quasi - spherical accretion , the probability of the accreted material reaching the critical density to flash is expected to be greatest for times just after a dip .    in figure  [ burststat ]",
    "we show the phase distribution of 41 x - ray bursts as recorded by oso-8 , exosat , ginga and rxte when folded on our final x - ray dip ephemeris ( with phase 0 the phase of primary dips ) .",
    "one third of the bursts concentrate in phase 0 - 0.2 ( after primary dip ) .",
    "the distribution has a @xmath54 probability of 0.006 of being random ( flat ) .",
    "the binomial probability of detecting 17 bursts in the `` interesting '' phase interval @xmath00  0.2 ( required to match typical dip durations ( cf . figure  [ tenfef ] ) and thus enhanced accretion time ) relative to the uniform distribution ( 8 bursts ) is 0.016 .",
    "no such effect is seen if the burst times are folded on the optical period ( dashed line in figure  [ burststat ] ) .",
    "table 3 shows all the x - ray dip periods reported since 1982 .",
    "the side bands from the rxte analysis of x1916 - 053 may explain the many different reports of the x - ray dip periodicity of x1916 - 053 .",
    "owing to the insufficient time span of the observations , both uncertainties of the 3000 sec period peak and its first neighbor side bands are large such that the peaks merge to affect the centroid of the 3000 sec peak .",
    "the centroid shifts left or right depending on which ( first left or right ) side band is more significant .",
    "the analysis in this paper suggests that there is a @xmath03.9d period modulation in the dip width and depth , and the phases may also have a @xmath03.9d period jitter with an amplitude of 0.1 ( peak - to - peak ) . the 6.5@xmath11.1d period for dip phase reported by yoshida et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is probably the sub - harmonic of 3.9d period .",
    "the optical modulation also has a @xmath04d period in amplitude , and possibly phase modulation ( grindlay 1992 ) , which is consistent with our rxte x - ray observations .    the fact that both the x - ray and the optical light curves have the @xmath0 3.9d beat period implies that there are 3 periodicities in the x1916 - 053 system , with periods of approximately 3000 sec , 3027 sec and @xmath03.9d .",
    "of these three periodicities , at most two of them are independent because of the beat relation among them .",
    "one of the two short ( 3000 sec and 3027 sec ) periods should represent the binary orbital period and it should be the more stable one .",
    "both the optical and the x - ray period have long - term stabilities over the total historical data span of @xmath09 years and @xmath017 years respectively .",
    "the period derivative of the optical modulation could be @xmath014 times larger than that for the x - ray dips , although both @xmath53 values are statistically insignificant .",
    "the phase jitter statistics show that the x - ray dips have smaller fluctuations than the optical minima .",
    "thus the x - ray dip period may be the better candidate for the orbital period , and thus x1916 - 053 contains a precessing disk as in su uma systems .",
    "however , the larger optical phase jitter could simply be due to the shallower modulation in the optical vs. x - ray ( compare figure  [ tyoplc ] and figure  [ tenfef ] ) .",
    "our result that the x - ray dips have less phase jitter , and are at least ( if not more ) stable over the historical database , provides strong support for the su uma model . applying the su uma model to the x1916 system , the 3000 sec x - ray dip period is the orbital period which is due to the shadow of accretion stream which crosses our line of sight @xmath00.1 in binary phase before the secondary star .",
    "the 3027 sec optical period ( the `` superhump '' period ) is due to the beat with the 3.9d precession period of accretion disk .",
    "the asymmetric disk and its @xmath03.9d retrograde precession that changes the vertical structure ( cloudlets ) at the outer edge with @xmath03.9d period , provide an explanation for the 3.9d modulation of x - ray dip shape and phase .",
    "q is the mass ratio , r is the ratio of disk radius and binary separation and @xmath62 is the laplace coefficient of order 0 in celestial mechanics ( see brouwer and clemence 1961 , equation 42 , chapter 15 ) . hirose and osaki also demonstrated that the tidal instability of accretion disks is caused by the parametric resonance between particle orbits in the disk and the orbiting secondary star with 1:3 period ratio .",
    "then , from kepler s third law , @xmath63 for the tidal instability radius . from the laplace coefficients in brouwer and clemence ( 1961 ) , @xmath64 . applying this model to the x1916 - 053 system , for which @xmath65= 0.0089 , the mass ratio is q = 0.022 , or the mass of the secondary star @xmath66=0.03@xmath67 for the assumed 1.4 @xmath67 neutron star .",
    "this compares favorably with the value @xmath66=0.016@xmath67 derived from the requirement that roche lobe - filling secondary has @xmath68 .",
    "thus the secondary is indeed a helium white dwarf , as expected from its binary period .",
    "the analysis in this paper indicates that the x - ray dip period is more likely to be the true orbital period , which supports the su uma model",
    ". the only problem may be the stability of the superhump period .",
    "the optical period derivative obtained by the 1987 - 1996 dataset is @xmath69 , whereas the su uma stars typically have @xmath70 ( patterson et al .",
    "however , patterson et al.(1993b ) showed that the range of superhump period derivatives is @xmath71 ( for v795 her , @xmath72 , see zhang et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "am cvn(=hz 29 ) , a binary with a white dwarf primary star and low mass helium white dwarf secondary star , is a compact binary system which has behavior similar to x1916 - 053 .",
    "it has two periods , 1028 sec and 1050 sec .",
    "patterson et al .",
    "( 1993c ) discovered the 13.38 hr period , the beat period of the 1028 sec and 1050 , in the helium absorption - line profile and suggested that its accretion disk is elliptical and slowly precesses around the white dwarf .",
    "provencal et al . ( 1995 ) and solheim et al . ( 1998 ) analyzed the whole earth telescope ( wet ) data and discovered the 1051 sec period is very stable with period derivative of @xmath73(@xmath0 10 years baseline ) ( time scale of 4 - 12 months ) but the mean period has not wandered more than 0.1 sec in 35 years , which leads to @xmath74 ( skillman et al .",
    "1999 ) . ] .",
    "they concluded that 1051 sec is the orbital period and 1028 sec is the superhump period which would be opposite to the normal superhump system and not supported by the tidal instability model . on the other hand , skillman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that the period derivative of 1028 sec period is even more stable with @xmath75 ( over 7 years baseline ) .",
    "thus , they concluded the shorter period is the orbital period and the longer one is the superhump period , which is comparable with our results for x1916 - 053 .",
    "both systems thus have very stable long - term superhump periods ( @xmath76(am cvn)=@xmath77 and @xmath76(x1916 - 053 ) @xmath78 , @xmath79 times smaller than ones from typical superhumps of dwarf novae ) .",
    "therefore , at least some of the `` superhump cvs '' ( e.g. am cvn , v795 her ) have very stable superhump periods comparable to x1916 - 053 .    the very stable superhump period implies a corresponding stable mean mass transfer rate , and thus x - ray luminosity .",
    "this is because conservative mass transfer ( assumed ) at rate @xmath80 implies @xmath53/@xmath81 = @xmath80/@xmath66 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1993 ) where @xmath66 is the secondary star mass .",
    "our limit ( eq .",
    "( 8) ) implies that @xmath82 , or @xmath83 erg / sec , which is a factor of @xmath010 larger than the typical system luminosity measured from our rxte data ( bloser et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus , measurement of @xmath84 , combined with measured variations in @xmath85 on the @xmath0190d period ( see below ) , might allow a conclusive test of the su uma model .",
    "although the su uma ( or superhump ) model is the conservative choice , we can not exclude the triple model ( grindlay et al 1988 , grindlay 1989 ) since it could also explain the reported ( priedhorsky and terrell 1984 ; hereafter pt84 ) 199d long - term modulation of x1916 - 053 ( cf .",
    "section 2 ) .",
    "we have searched for the @xmath0199d period by an epoch - folding analysis .",
    "we find comparably significant peaks in a @xmath14 vs. period plot at @xmath0160d and 190d but not at the 198.6@xmath11.72d value found by pt84 .",
    "longer epoch analysis for the 199d period is needed , since the @xmath04 yr rxte / asm data span is short enough that a `` local '' period departure of the mazeh - shaham period is possible ( mazeh , private communication ) .",
    "extended x - ray and optical coverage is also needed to reduce the limits on @xmath53 for both the x - ray dip and optical periods . although the predicted ( bailyn 1987 ) phase glitches for the x - ray dips , and the implied phase clustering of x - ray dips vs. optical ( binary ) minima , are not found in our phase analysis ( except possibly for secondary dips ) , more simultaneous x - ray and optical observations are needed .    the strongest remaining evidence for the triple model is the surprising clustering of x - ray burst times vs. the times of x - ray dips ( cf .",
    "figure  [ burststat ] ) .",
    "this would be expected under the triple model if the enhanced matter in the accretion ring can be accreted very rapidly onto the ns : for bursts to occur within the @xmath00.2 phase bin following a dip , the accretion time must be @xmath86600 sec .",
    "this itself would be almost as interesting as the retrograde triple system nature ( and its origin ; possibly in a globular cluster ) , since such a surprisingly short accretion timescales implies accretion via an adaf - like quasi - spherical flow , rather than a dense accretion disk , from the ring down to the ns .",
    "although the dip vs. burst association appears to be significant , more data are ( as usual ) needed .",
    "quasi stable burst repetition times have been seen in one other source , gs1826 - 238 ( cocchi et al 2000 ) , but without the remarkable stability apparent in x1916 - 053 .",
    "+ if the bursts are indeed correlated with dips ( i.e. follow by @xmath00.0 - 0.2 phase ) , then under the simple binary and su uma model this would imply bursts are preferentially detected when the @xmath00.03@xmath67 wd secondary is approximately aligned between us and the ns ( i.e. when the ns would be eclipsed if the system were at higher inclination ) .",
    "we consider two very unlikely possibilities : lensing and beaming .",
    "the wd - ns alignment might suggest gravitational lensing or focusing small bursts on the ns otherwise not detectable .",
    "however , this would not preferentially amplify bursts since the accretion luminosity would be similarly lensed .",
    "the near - eclipse wd - ns alignment could imply burst emission is somehow beamed , perhaps by the wd - ns accretion stream - tube which might confine the burst at its footprint on ns by magnetic pressure .",
    "the lensing or beaming scenarios are both so implausible that confirmation of the burst - dip association would ( virtually ) require the triple model .",
    "a final test of the triple vs su uma models could be made by irrefutably establishing the burst correlations ( triple model ) or spectroscopically showing that the dip period is the binary period ( su uma model ) .",
