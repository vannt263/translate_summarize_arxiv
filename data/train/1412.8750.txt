    "it has been observed that lialh@xmath0 desorbs hydrogen through a two - step process , similar to that reported in the widely studied naalh@xmath0 , i.e. ,  @xcite @xmath1 @xmath2 the first reaction occurs around 112@xmath3220@xmath4c with a theoretical hydrogen release of 5.3 wt% .",

    ".formation energies ( @xmath12 ) and migration barriers ( @xmath89 ) for native defects in lialh@xmath0 .",
    "migration barriers denoted by an asterisk ( @xmath90 ) are the lower bounds , estimated by considering the defect as a complex and taking the highest of the migration barriers of the constituents . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         there are drastic changes in the lattice geometry as ti and ni impurities are incorporated .",
    "the transition - metal impurities tend to pull ( alh@xmath0)@xmath46 units closer and/or , in some cases , break al@xmath3h bonds to form m@xmath91 complexes .",
    "figure [ fig;tihn ] shows the local structures of several substitutional and interstitial ti configurations in lialh@xmath0 .",
    "the creation of ti@xmath92 , for example , leads to the formation of a complex in which the ti atom is surrounded by @xmath93=9 hydrogen atoms with the ti@xmath3h distances ranging from 1.81 to 1.93  , _ cf . _",
    "[ fig;tihn](a ) .",
    "these ti@xmath3h bond lengths are comparable to that in bulk tih@xmath6 , which is 1.92  .",
    "other impurities such as ti@xmath94 , ti@xmath95 , ti@xmath96 , ti@xmath97 , and ti@xmath98 also lead to formation of tih@xmath99 ( @xmath93=6@xmath38 ) complexes with the ti@xmath3h distances ranging from 1.78 to 1.95  .",
    "similarly , ni impurities also form nih@xmath99 complexes , however the @xmath93 value is smaller than those of ti .",
    "for example , ni@xmath92 is surrounded by 6 hydrogen atoms , instead of 9 hydrogen atoms in the case of ti@xmath92 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that ni has fewer empty 3@xmath100 states than ti .",
    "following our argumentation presented previously for other complex hydrides such as naalh@xmath0 , libh@xmath0 , and li@xmath0bn@xmath7h@xmath101 ,  @xcite the fermi level of the system is determined by these electrically active impurities if their concentration is larger than that of the native defects .",
    "chances are that this fermi - level position will be different from the one that would occur in the absence of the impurities . in this case the formation energy of some of the native defects will be reduced . for those impurities that have negative-@xmath56 character",
    ", the fermi level will simply coincide with the @xmath102(+@xmath17/@xmath103 ) transition level of the impurities.@xcite for those impurities that exhibit positive @xmath56 and @xmath102(+@xmath17/0)@xmath27@xmath88@xmath27@xmath102(0/@xmath103 ) such as ni@xmath50 , _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ tab : impurities ] , the the impurity have no effect since it prefers the neutral charge state over a range of fermi - level values that includes the fermi - level position where the lithium - related defects switch charge state.@xcite clearly , the effects of ni and ti impurities on shifting the fermi level depend sensitively on how the impurities are incorporated into lialh@xmath0 .    for ni@xmath104 , ni@xmath105 , and ti@xmath105 , the fermi - level shift will result in lowering the formation energy of @xmath73 . since the formation and diffusion of @xmath73 corresponds to formation of h@xmath6 ( and al ) in the mechanism we proposed for the decomposition and dehydrogenation of lialh@xmath0 , this may lead to a reduction in the onset decomposition temperature ( or the effective decomposition temperature ) as seen in experiments .",
    "this shift , however , would also result in increasing the formation energy of h@xmath53 . in this way , ni@xmath105 , ni@xmath104 , and ti@xmath105 lower the activation energy associated with @xmath73 but increase that associated with h@xmath53 . upon introducing the impurities into lialh@xmath0 , @xmath106 changes from 0 ev up to @xmath30.12 ev ( ni@xmath104 ) , @xmath30.44 ev ( ni@xmath105 ) , or @xmath30.42 ev ( ti@xmath105 ) .",
    "note that , as the fermi level is shifted , some charged native defects may occur with higher concentrations to counteract the effects of the electrically active impurities , and reduce the magnitude of @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath106 reaches @xmath30.12 ev , the activation energies associated with @xmath73 and h@xmath53 are both equal to 0.99 ev . for lower @xmath106 values , the activation energy associated with h@xmath53 is higher than that associated with @xmath73 . as a result ,",
    "the process associated with h@xmath53 becomes the rate - limiting step in hydrogen desorption .",
    "our analyses , therefore , indicate that ni@xmath104 , ni@xmath105 , and ti@xmath105 can modify the activation energy .",
    "in fact , these impurities can reduce the activation energy by up to about 0.12 ev , which is in good agreement with some experimental observations .",
    "@xcite using similar arguments , we predict that ti@xmath50 would not lower the activation energy for hydrogen desorption according to the proposed mechanism .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive first - principles study of native defects and transition - metal impurities in lialh@xmath0 . the compound is found to be prone to frenkel disorder on the li sublattice .",
    "lithium interstitials and vacancies have low formation energies and are highly mobile , which can participate in lithium - ion conduction , and act as accompanying defects in hydrogen mass transport .",
    "we have proposed a specific mechanism for the decomposition of lialh@xmath0 that involves the formation and migration of h@xmath53 , @xmath73 , and ( li@xmath52,@xmath65 ) in the bulk lialh@xmath0 .",
    "our calculated activation energy is in agreement with the experimental values . in light of this atomistic mechanism ,",
    "we are able to explain the decomposition and dehydrogenation of lialh@xmath0 , the rate - limiting step in the hydrogen desorption kinetics , and the effects of transition - metal ( ti and ni ) impurities on the onset decomposition temperature and on the activation energy .",
    "our results also suggest that it is the structure of h@xmath53 that determines the hydride phase ( li@xmath7alh@xmath31 or lih ) in the decomposition products .",
    "this relationship should be further explored in other complex hydrides .",
