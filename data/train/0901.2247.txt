    "the study of the generation and suppression of turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas is still a high priority topic in theoretical and experimental magnetic fusion research . in recent studies ,",
    "the important role played by nonlinearly self - generated zonal flows for the regulation of turbulent transport has been emphasized  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "these are radially localized flows ( wave - vector @xmath0 ) , propagating mainly in the poloidal direction , which can reduce the radial transport by shearing the eddies of the driving background turbulence .",
    "the turbulence and anomalous transport observed in tokamak plasmas is generally attributed to short - wavelength drift - type instabilities , driven by gradients in the plasma density , temperature , magnetic field , etc .",
    "for the hot core region of a tokamak plasma , the two main drift - wave candidates are the toroidal ion temperature gradient ( itg ) mode and the collisionless trapped electron mode ( tem ) .",
    "accordingly , the generation of zonal flows by non - linear interactions among drift waves has recently been studied both analytically  @xcite-  @xcite and numerically  @xcite-  @xcite . while a substantial effort has been devoted to the study of zonal flow generation by itg modes ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite for an analytical treatment ) , very little work has been published on zonal flows driven by pure tem  @xcite-  @xcite . in tokamak plasma experiments ,",
    "tem are expected to play a dominant role in the hot electron regime ( @xmath1 ) , relevant for experiments with dominant central electron heating  @xcite-  @xcite and in advanced confinement regimes with electron transport barriers ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the study of zonal flows and turbulence driven by tem is therefore crucial for the assessment of these regimes .",
    "in addition , an estimate of the zonal flow generation close to marginal stability is essential in order to discriminate between the tem and the potentially important electron temperature gradient ( etg- ) mode  @xcite-  @xcite in comparison of experimental profiles against linear thresholds .",
    "the experimental temperature gradients ( or inverse scale lengths ) are typically found to be about a factor of 2 above the linear thresholds , both for itg and tem . in the cyclone study",
    "@xcite , this factor was 1.7 for the itg mode .",
    "however , the nonlinear upshift , due to zonal flows , increased the effective itg threshold by a factor 1.5 , thus bringing it much closer to the experimental gradient .",
    "although a comprehensive and quantitative investigation of zonal flow generation would require a nonlinear gyrokinetic treatment , a qualitative analytical study , based on a reduced set of fluid equations , is feasible and also more transparent in terms of physics interpretation .    in the present paper ,",
    "the generation of zonal flows by pure tem is studied analytically in the limit @xmath3 where the itg mode is suppressed , using a reduced fluid model for the trapped electron dynamics .",
    "a system of equations is derived which describes the coupling between the background tem turbulence , described by a wave - kinetic equation , and the zonal flow modes generated by reynolds stress forces .",
    "the qualitative analytical technique used here follows closely the wkb analysis employed in  @xcite and  @xcite for zonal flow generation by itg turbulence .",
    "the purpose of the study is to obtain a qualitative estimate of the zonal flow growth rate driven by tem and to compare with an itg driven case , and in addition examine its scaling with plasma parameters for typical tokamak parameter values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii the model equations for the itg / tem system is presented and a reduced model for tem turbulence is presented .",
    "the equations describing the coupling between the background tem turbulence and the zonal flows are presented in section iii and most explicit derivations are put in the appendix a. in section iv the results are discussed and finally there is a summary in section v.",
    "the description used for the coupled toroidal itg and collisionless tem system is based on the continuity and temperature equations for the ions and the trapped electrons  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the density and temperature perturbations ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents ions and trapped electrons ) and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the @xmath11 velocity , @xmath12 is the diamagnetic drift velocity , @xmath13 is the polarization drift velocity , @xmath14 is the stress tensor drift velocity and @xmath15 is the heat flux .",

    "thus , for @xmath44 we obtain a pure itg mode . for pure itg mode physics ,",
    "the fluid model used here has been found to be in good qualitative agreement with a number of gyrokinetic treatments .",
    "for example , both the @xmath45-scaling of the ion heat transport  @xcite and the nonlinear upshift of the linear itg threshold due to zonal flows  @xcite has been recovered by the fluid model  @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive version of the model , based on the full itg and te system ( equations 4 - 7 ) , has been heavily used in predictive transport code simulations  @xcite-  @xcite of tokamak discharges .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the model is able to reproduce experimental profiles of temperatures and density , inside the edge region , with good accuracy over a wide range of plasma parameters . in the limit @xmath46",
    ", we obtain a pure tem . in tokamak plasmas",
    "the tem is expected to dominate in the hot electron regime ( @xmath47 ) and/or in regimes with @xmath48 .",
    "however , for peaked density profiles ( small @xmath49 ) , the ion and trapped electron responses are strongly coupled ( @xmath50 ) and a density gradient driven tem appears for weak temperature gradients . in the following we will neglect the effects of ion perturbations on the tem and hence only consider electron temperature gradient driven tem ( not including the electron temperature gradient mode ( etg ) ) .",
    "the dispersion relation then takes the form    @xmath51    equation 11 describes tems driven by @xmath52 and suppressed by @xmath53 leading to a linear tem stability threshold in the parameter @xmath54 . in the considered limit",
    "the tem is fairly symmetrical to the toroidal itg mode , except that effects of finite - larmor - radius and parallel electron dynamics do not appear in the tem dispersion relation .",
    "the solution to equation 11 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and the linear stability threshold is given by @xmath57 in this regime we can define a reduced model for electron temperature gradient driven tem turbulence by retaining equations ( 4)-(5 ) for the trapped electron fluid while neglecting ion dynamics ( 6)-(7 ) ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the effect of the neglected ion dynamics on the linear physics will in the following be quantified by comparing the results of the reduced ( equation ( 11 ) ) with the complete ( equation ( 9 ) ) dispersion relation .",
    "in describing the large scale plasma flow dynamics it is assumed that there is a sufficient spectral gap between the small scale tem fluctuations and the large scale flow .",
    "the electrostatic potential is represented by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fluctuating potential varying on the turbulent scales @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the zonal flow potential varying on the slow scale @xmath62 ( the zonal flow potential is independent on @xmath63 ) .",
    "the evolution of the tem turbulence in the background of the slowly varying zonal flow @xmath61 can be described by the wave - kinetic equation  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite for the adiabatic invariant @xmath64 ( see appendix a for a derivation of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) .",

    "it is assumed that the rhs is approximately zero ( stationary turbulence ) .",
    "the role of non - linear interactions among the tem fluctuations ( here represented by a non - linear frequency shift @xmath69 ) is to balance linear growth rate , i.e. @xmath70 . the tem turbulence is assumed to be adiabatically modulated by the slowly growing potential @xmath61 .",
    "equation ( 17 ) is then expanded under the assumption of small deviations from the equilibrium spectrum function ; @xmath71 where @xmath72 evolves at the zonal flow time and space scale @xmath73 , as @xmath74 @xmath75 here @xmath76 , since the effects of electron flr is neglected .",
    "+   + the evolution equations for the zonal flow is obtained after averaging the ion - continuity equation over the magnetic flux surface and over fast scales and employing quasi - neutrality ( equation 8) @xmath77 here we have assumed that the turbulence is dominated by the tem ( @xmath78 ) and hence only the small scale self interactions among the tem are contributing to the reynolds stress in the rhs of ( 20 )  @xcite . expressing the reynolds stress terms in equation ( 20 ) in @xmath65 we obtain @xmath79 the factor @xmath66 defines the relationship between small scale turbulence and the wave action density , see appendix equation a9 for details . integrating by parts in @xmath80 and assuming a monochromatic wave packet @xmath81 and using equations ( 19 ) and ( 21 ) gives @xmath82 the dispersion relation for zonal flow @xmath83 reduces to @xmath84 hence , the zonal flow growth rate scales as @xmath85 . in expressing the zonal flow growth in dimensional form making use of equation ( 23 ) , it is assumed that the background turbulence ( in the absence of zonal flows ) reach the mixing length level for temperature gradient driven modes corresponding to @xmath86 .",
