    "the standard fireball shock scenario for gamma ray bursts ( grb ) assumes a synchrotron and/or an inverse compton ( ic ) spectrum , in good general agreement with a number of observations ( tavani 1996 ; cohen 1997 , panaitescu , spada & 1999 ) . the physical motivation for this scenario is strong ; it would indeed be surprising if the expansion of the ejecta from the huge energies inferred in grb did not lead to shocks , where synchrotron and ic radiation play a significant role .",
    "one need only remind oneself of the dominant role of these effects in agn jets and supernova remnants .",
    "however , in a significant fraction of bursts there is evidence in the 1 - 10 kev range for spectral intensity slopes steeper than 1/3 ( photon number slopes flatter than -2/3 ) , as well as in some cases for a soft x - ray excess over the extrapolated power law from higher energies ( preece 1998 , 1999 ; crider 1997 , etc . ) , and this has served as the motivation for considering a thermal ( e.g. liang ( 1997 ) or a thermal / nonthermal ( liang 1999 ) comptonization mechanism . while an astrophysical model where this mechanism would arise naturally has been left largely unspecified , ghisellini & celotti 1999 have pointed out that if internal shocks lead to high compactness parameters and pair formation , this could naturally produce conditions where the pair temperature and the scattering opacity are self - regulated at values favoring comptonization .",
    "there is also a trend in current analyses of grb spectra indicating that the apparent clustering of spectral break energies in the 50 kev-1 mev range is not due to observational selection effects ( e.g. preece 1998 ; brainerd 1998 ; see however dermer 1999a ) .",
    "models to explain a preferred break physically , e.g. through a compton attenuation model ( brainerd 1998 ) require reprocessing by an external medium whose column density adjusts itself near a few g @xmath3 .",
    "more recently a preferred break has been attributed to the blackbody peak of the fireball photosphere when this occurs at the comoving pair recombination temperature in the accelerating regime , which is blueshifted to the appropriate observer frame energy ( eichler & levinson 1999 ) , and in this case the rayleigh - jeans portion of the photosphere provides a steep low energy spectral slope . to get a photosphere as close in as to occur at the pair annihilation temperature",
    "requires an extremely low baryon load outflow ; the presence of a high energy power law extending to gev then requires a separate explanation .    at the other extreme of large baryon load outflows ,",
    "thompson ( 1994 ) has considered scattering off mhd turbulence in photospheres in the coasting regime , which boosts the adiabatically cooled thermal photons near the photospheric peak up to a larger break energy , leading to canonical energy slopes of 0 and -1 ( photon slopes -1 and -2 ) below and above the break .",
    "an alternative scenario is that of ghisellini & celotti ( 1999 ) , who invoke @xmath4 pair breakdown in high compactness shocks above the photosphere to achieve a self - regulating nonrelativistic lepton temperature and scattering optical depth of order a few , leading to a thermal comptonization spectrum with standardized features . while this does not explain steep low energy slopes it does provide nonthermal spectral energy power laws of slope @xmath5 close to those of synchrotron , as well as a standard temperature which would lead to a preferred break in the observer frame , if the bulk lorentz factor is in a narrow range .    in this paper",
    "we synthesize and extend some of these ideas within the framework of the standard fireball internal shock model . while in our previous work ( e.g. , laguna & rees 1993 , rees & 1994 ) we considered photospheres and pair formation , their thermal character , the strong uncompensated photosphere redshift in the coasting phase , and the lack of a straightforward way to get from these a power law extending to gev energies served as compelling arguments for concentrating on the synchrotron and inverse compton mechanisms . here",
    "we re - examine the relative roles of photospheres and shocks , as well as those of synchrotron , pair breakdown , scattering on mhd waves and comptonization .",
    "this leads to a unified picture where both shocks and/or a photosphere with a nonthermal component can provide most of the luminosity , and where the synchrotron and ic mechanisms in shocks provide the primary spectrum or ( in high comoving luminosity cases ) the trigger for pair breakdown leading to comptonization .",
    "we investigate the range of burst model parameters over which different mechanisms come to the fore , and discuss their role in providing flatter or steeper spectral slopes as well as preferred spectral break energies .",

    "however , fresh motivation for reconsidering the role of photospheres and pairs is provided by the evidence , in a non - negligible fraction of bursts , of low energy ( 1 - 10 kev ) spectral slopes steeper than 1/3 in energy ( or 4/3 in @xmath198 ) and in some cases an x - ray excess above the power law extrapolation from higher energies , as well as the ubiquitousness of observed break energies clustering between 50 - 1000 kev ( discussed in  1 and references there ) .",
    "a look at figures 2 and 3 shows that allowing a larger role to photospheres and comptonized pairs provides a way of addressing these observational trends .",
    "if photospheres are rather more important than shocks ( e.g. due to some preference for very high @xmath27 , weakly varying outflows or low shock efficiencies ) the thermal component can provide low energy slopes as steep as @xmath199 in @xmath200 ( while flatter slopes can be achieved through integration or distributions ) .",
    "the same can explain an x - ray excess well above the power law extrapolation from above .",
    "reasonable break energies can be obtained from either the synchrotron or pair comptonization mechanisms in the shock , but they depend on @xmath60 , and unless the range of @xmath27 is narrow they would not necessarily cluster between 50 - 1000 kev . in the case of pair comptonization",
    "they also tend to be a bit high , unless the equilibrium pair temperature is @xmath201 .",
    "a preferred break could be attributed to a photospheric peak , provided baryon loads are very low , @xmath202 in all cases ; this still requires a strong shock synchrotron component , or possibly alfvn wave comptonization in the photosphere , to explain the high energy power law spectra .",
    "it would also imply a pronounced upward change of slope above the break , from the thermal peak to a flatter power law in all bursts where a break is observed , unless the shock or alfvn wave scattering always produces a luminosity comparable to the thermal photosphere . preferred break energies arise naturally if thompson s ( 1994 ) proposed mechanism of comptonization by alfvn wave damping in the photosphere",
    "is taken at face value and has good efficiency , leading to a source frame break around 0.5 mev .",
    "note that the comptonized spectral slopes discussed here ( either from thermal pairs in shocks or alfvn waves in the photosphere ) are nominally 1 and 0 in @xmath114 , but for simple time - dependent calculations an evolving slope is expected ( e.g. liang , 1999 , thompson 1994 ) . in reality",
    "the actual time dependence for an unsteady outflow leading to shocks , pair breakdown and comptonization could be more complicated .",
    "if both a photospheric and a shock component are detected , one would expect the thermal photospheric luminosity ( and its non - thermal part , if present ) to vary on similar timescales as the nonthermal synchrotron or pair comptonized shock component ( unless the shock efficiency is radius dependent , or unless one or both are beyond @xmath203 , in which case @xmath204 imposes a lower limit on the corresponding variability timescale ) .",
    "but even if the bolometric luminosity varies on the same timescale , the luminosity in a given band ( e.g. batse ) probably varies differently , since the thermal peak energy is @xmath205 and falls off steeply on either side , while the synchrotron peak energy varies @xmath206 and falls off more slowly .",
    "the pair comptonized break energy on the other hand varies as @xmath207 , and also drops off slowly on the low energy side , or on both sides if scattering off waves is present in the high energy side .",
    "if observations at high time resolution become possible in x - ray or optical during the burst ( as opposed to the afterglow ) , we would expect ( c.f . figure 2 ) the bursts with shorter time structure ( low @xmath105 ) to be more suppressed at these wavelengths , compared to those with longer variability timescales .    in summary",
    ", there are several plausible mechanisms for producing a preferred energy break , which rely on internal properties of the outflow . in those bursts with low energy slopes steeper than implied by synchrotron ,",
    "the prominence of the photosphere is a likely explanation , in which case its luminosity could in some cases vary differently from the higher energy power law component .",
    "intrinsically high luminosity bursts , where pair breakdown is inferred , would be predicted to have generally harder high energy power slopes than in lower luminosity bursts where synchrotron provides the high energy slope .",
    "if photospheric comptonization on alfvn waves is responsible for the high energy power law slopes , the thermal peak and the power law should vary together in time . in this case a straightforward prediction is that the thermal peak photon energy and the intrinsic luminosity allow one to determine the expected maximum photon energy @xmath208 .",
