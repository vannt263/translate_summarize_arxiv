    "since spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a dominant property of the qcd vacuum and is responsible for much of the low energy physics seen in nature , having a first principles formulation of lattice qcd which does not explicitly break chiral symmetry has been an important goal . both wilson and staggered fermions recover chiral symmetry in the continuum limit but with these techniques the chiral and continuum limits can not be decoupled . for the qcd phase transition , which is dominantly a chiral symmetry restoring transition , a formulation that is free of violations of chiral symmetry due to lattice artifacts , should give a phase transition more closely approximating that of the continuum limit . for the measurement of matrix elements of operators in hadronic states ,",
    "a formulation that respects chiral symmetry on the lattice substantially reduces operator mixing through renormalization .",
    "lastly , since much of our analytic understanding of low - energy qcd is formulated in terms of low - energy effective field theories based on chiral symmetry , a lattice formulation preserving chiral symmetry allows controlled comparison with analytic expectations .    building on the work of kaplan @xcite , who showed how to produce light chiral modes in a @xmath14 dimensional theory as surface states in a @xmath15 dimensional theory , a number of attractive lattice formulations have been developed which achieve a decoupling of the continuum and chiral limits . here",
    "we will use kaplan s approach as was further developed by narayanan and neuberger @xcite and by shamir @xcite .",
    "it is shamir s approach , commonly known as the domain wall fermion formulation , which we adopt .",

    "the desired light , chiral fermions appear as states exponentially bound to the four - dimensional surfaces at the ends of the fifth dimension .",
    "the remaining modes for @xmath16 are heavy and delocalized in the fifth dimension .",
    "an additional important feature of the domain wall fermion dirac operator in the limit @xmath17 is the existence of an `` index '' , an integer that is invariant under small changes in the background gauge field . here",
    "@xmath5 is the extent of the lattice in the fifth dimension .",
    "this property , true for all but a set of gauge fields of measure zero , can be readily seen using the overlap formalism @xcite . in the smooth background field limit",
    ", this index is the normal topological charge but , even for rough fields , it signals the presence of massless fermion mode(s ) when non - zero .",
    "these zero modes can easily be recognized in numerical studies with semiclassical gauge field backgrounds @xcite .",

    "a fundamental question , which is a major part of this paper , involves quantifying the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects of finite extent in the fifth dimension .    due to current limits on computer speed ,",
    "some lattice qcd studies are only practical when the fermionic determinant is left out of the measure of the path integral .",
    "the resulting quenched theory does not suppress gauge field configurations with light fermionic modes , in contrast with the original theory where , for small quark mass , the determinant strongly damps such configurations .",
    "the measurement of observables involving fermion propagation through configurations with unsuppressed light fermionic modes can in principle lead to markedly different infrared behavior than that found in full qcd , in the limit of small quark masses .",
    "domain wall fermions , which produce light chiral modes at finite lattice spacing and preserve the global symmetries of continuum qcd , should produce a well - defined chiral limit for full qcd .",
    "the central question addressed in this paper is whether a well - controlled chiral limit also exists within the quenched approximation .",
    "a thorough theoretical and numerical understanding of the quenched chiral limit is essential if the good chiral properties of domain wall fermions are to be exploited in quenched lattice simulations .",
    "here we present results from extensive simulations of quenched qcd with domain wall fermions , primarily at two lattice spacings , @xmath18 and 2 gev .",
    "many different values for the fifth dimensional extent , @xmath5 , and the bare quark mass , @xmath19 have been used .",

    "we study the pion mass in the chiral limit in section [ sec : chiral_m_pi ] , which requires understanding zero mode effects .",

    "a divergence for @xmath33 is clearly visible on the smaller volume , but not on the larger .",
    "this is expected since @xmath34 should go as @xmath35 and is clear evidence for unsuppressed zero modes in quenched qcd , first reported in ref .",
    "notice that there may be other problems with the chiral limit of @xmath20 that are masked by this @xmath36 divergence .    : with this clear evidence for zero mode effects in @xmath20 , one might expect to see zero mode contributions in any quark propagator @xmath37 if at both @xmath38 and @xmath39 a single zero eigenvector has reasonable magnitude .",
    "for sufficiently large volume , needed to see asymptotic behavior in the limit of large @xmath40 , there should be no zero mode effects .",
    "our results for the zero mode effects on the pion mass are presented in figure [ fig : mpi2_vs_mf_b5_7_8nt32_ls48 ] which shows @xmath41 versus @xmath19 for @xmath42 lattices with @xmath43 and figure [ fig : mpi2_vs_mf_b5_7_16nt32_ls48_mres ] , where all the parameters are the same except that the volume was increased to @xmath2 .",

    "in the previous section , our results for quark masses @xmath23 were given , where the smallest values of @xmath19 gave @xmath256 .",

    "<S> quenched qcd simulations on three volumes , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and three couplings , @xmath3 , 5.85 and 6.0 using domain wall fermions provide a consistent picture of quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the small induced effects of chiral symmetry breaking inherent in this formulation can be described by a residual mass ( @xmath4 ) whose size decreases as the separation between the domain walls ( @xmath5 ) is increased . </S>",
    "<S> however , at stronger couplings much larger values of @xmath5 are required to achieve a given physical value of @xmath4 . for @xmath6 and @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath8 , while for @xmath3 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> these values are significantly smaller than those obtained from a more naive determination in our earlier studies . </S>",
    "<S> important effects of topological near zero modes which should afflict an accurate quenched calculation are easily visible in both the chiral condensate and the pion propagator . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can be controlled by working at an appropriately large volume . </S>",
    "<S> a non - linear behavior of @xmath12 in the limit of small quark mass suggests the presence of additional infrared subtlety in the quenched approximation . </S>",
    "<S> good scaling is seen both in masses and in @xmath13 over our entire range , with inverse lattice spacing varying between 1 and 2 gev .    </S>"
