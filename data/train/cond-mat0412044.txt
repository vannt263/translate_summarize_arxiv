    "electromagnetic waves propagate in straight trajectories in homogeneous materials .",
    "this simple propagation changes when the wave encounters inhomogeneities and is scattered .",
    "interference of the scattered waves can modify significantly their propagation .",
    "the careful engineering of the inhomogeneities may lead to the inhibition of the propagation in certain directions and to the enhancement in others .",
    "it is also possible to speed - up  @xcite or slow - down  @xcite the propagation of the wave and even to localize it  @xcite . the full control of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is intensively pursued since this control will lead to new concepts in numerous fields such as information processing  @xcite , laser physics  @xcite , bio - sensing  @xcite and quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent candidates for the control of the propagation of electromagnetic waves are photonic crystals .",
    "photonic crystals are periodic structures of two or more materials with different refractive indices  @xcite .",
    "interference of waves scattered at different lattice planes of the crystal determine its optical properties .",
    "depending on the structure and if the scattering is strong enough a photonic band gap ( pbg ) might be created .",
    "a pbg is a frequency range in which no optical modes are allowed and , consequently , the propagation of waves in this range is forbidden .",
    "particulary attractive is the extraordinary optical dispersion that photonic crystals exhibit , which leads to a pronounced variation of the wave s group velocity .",
    "the resonant scattering at the band edges of the gap gives rises to a strong reduction of the group velocity and a significant group velocity dispersion  @xcite .",
    "this slow propagation , which increases the interaction time between the wave and the crystal , constitutes the basis for the development of sensors for gases and bio - molecules  @xcite and more sensitive non - linear components  @xcite . a wave with a frequency in the pbg incident on a photonic crystal is reflected .",
    "however , if the crystal has a finite thickness , a fraction of the wave s intensity is transmitted . while the transmitted intensity decreases exponentially with the crystal thickness , the transmission time is independent of this thickness , which may lead to superluminal transmission .",
    "tunneling processes through photonic structures are of great scientific and technological interest  @xcite . among the reasons driving this interest",
    "are the similarities with the tunneling of quantum particles and the ongoing intense discussions on the propagation in the superluminal regime  @xcite .    in spite of the fundamental and technological relevance of dynamic properties of electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals most of the investigations so far focus only on stationary measurements .",
    "this focus is mainly imposed by the complexity of phase sensitive techniques at high frequencies .",
    "reports on the group velocity of waves in optical photonic crystals are thus seldom and limited to narrow frequency ranges  @xcite , to weakly scattering photonic crystals  @xcite , or to low dimensional photonic structures  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present a broadband time domain investigation of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in strongly - scattering - three - dimensional photonic crystals of variable size . in our investigation",
    "we use terahertz time - domain spectroscopy , a technique capable to generate ultrashort broadband pulses of thz radiation and to detect the amplitude and the phase of these pulses . through the direct access of amplitude and",
    "phase an unprecedented precision in the analysis of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals is achieved .",
    "the extinction coefficient is obtained from the exponential decrease of the transmitted amplitude with the thickness of the crystal . from the phase analysis of the transmitted wave the wave number , the effective refractive index and the group velocity are derived .",
    "very strong dispersion at the edges of the gap and anomalous dispersion at frequencies in the gap are observed . even in a photonic crystal with a thickness of only four unit cells",
    "the group velocity is dramatically reduced at the band edges by almost a factor 15 with respect to the speed of light in vacuum , while anomalous dispersion in the gap gives rise to superluminal transmission .",
    "the photonic crystals investigated are formed by intrinsic silicon and air .",
    "intrinsic silicon has a very large refractive index @xmath0 , and virtually no absorption at terahertz frequencies .",
    "photonic crystals are fabricated by micromachining thin wafers of silicon , and piling them to form a layer - by - layer structure  @xcite .",
    "such a structure consists of a transverse stacking of arrays of dielectric rods with a face - centered - tetragonal lattice symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this type of crystal structure exhibits a very large photonic band gap  @xcite .",
    "the micromachining of our crystal was done with a programmable dicing saw , as described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite : parallel grooves spaced by @xmath1 were diced on one side of a wafer with a thickness of @xmath2 . the thickness of the grooves is @xmath3 and the depth one half of the thickness of the wafer , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "perpendicular grooves to these with the same thickness and depth were diced in the opposite side .",
    "this method produces a square grid of apertures . to form the photonic crystal structure several of these grids",
    "are piled .",
    "consecutive grids are shifted by one half of the period and two of them form a single unit cell in the stacking direction .",
    "the dimension of this unit cell is thus @xmath5 .",
    "the calculation of the band structure of this specific photonic crystal predicts a pbg centered at 0.5 thz .",
    "figures  [ sem](a ) and ( b ) are scanning electron microscope images of a layer - by - layer structure with a thickness of 4 unit cells .",
    "figure  [ sem](a ) is a side view of the structure along the stacking direction , while ( b ) is a top view of the same photonic crystal .",
    "for the experiments we use a thz time - domain spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "this setup is schematically depicted in  fig .",
    "[ setup ] . a train of femtosecond pulses from a ti : sapphire laser is split to generate and detect single - cycle terahertz pulses .",
    "one beam , the so - called pump beam , is incident on an ingaas surface field emitter , generating thz radiation .",
    "the thz pulses are collected and collimated by a parabolic mirror placed at the focal distance to the emitter .",
    "this thz beam is incident normal to the surface of the crystal , and the transmitted amplitude is focused with a parabolic mirror onto a photoconductive antenna .",
    "the antenna is gated with the pulses from the second beam of the ti : sapphire laser . by means of a computer controlled delay stage ,",
    "the length difference between the generation and detection optical paths is varied and the thz field amplitude is detected as a function of time with sub - picosecond time resolution .",
    "water vapor absorbs thz radiation , therefore , the thz setup is enclosed in a box which is continuously fluxed with nitrogen gas .",
    "even though the measurements were done at only one direction , it has been demonstrated by imhof _",
    "_ that 1d models are not able to explain the measurements of the group velocity near the band edges of 3d photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "we have measured the transmission of thz pulses through photonic crystals with different thickness ranging from 1 to 4 unit cells .",
    "the experimental transients of the transmitted field amplitude are plotted in fig .",
    "[ pulses](a ) . the reference pulse , i.e. , the setup response , is also plotted in the same figure .",

    "[ pulses](b ) , and were performed with a commercial software ( fullwave by rsoft ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the simulations is 3 @xmath6 and the temporal resolution is 5 fs .",
    "the incident field was approximated to a plane wave by using a gaussian field distribution with a width much larger than the size of the simulation region .",
    "the temporal shape of the input thz field was a single - cycle pulse , with a center wavelength of 500 @xmath7 .",
    "the transmitted field was calculated at a distance of 2.3 mm from the source .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pulses ] , the transmitted pulse experiences a significant dispersion growing with the thickness of the crystal",
    ". signatures of the pbg formation become directly visible in the time domain data .",
    "particulary in the thickest crystals , low frequencies , belonging to the lower photonic crystal band , and high frequencies , associated to higher bands , are separated in time domain .    to analyze the transmission we calculate the complex fourier transform of the time - domain transmission through the crystal and normalized it by the reference measured without the sample .",
    "this transformation leads to a transmission @xmath8 of the form @xmath9 the modulus @xmath10 is the spectrally resolved field transmission coefficient , and the argument @xmath11 is the phase difference between the transmission through the crystal and the reference .",
    "equation ( [ t ] ) can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an effective propagation constant for the transmission through the crystal and @xmath14 is the thickness of the crystal .",

    "therefore the propagation constant has a real component or wave number @xmath21 even at frequencies within the gap . in section  [ phaseanalysis ] the analysis of the phase and the dispersion of the photonic crystals are discussed in detail .",

    "the phase difference ( fig .",

    "the interference pattern that is apparent by the oscillations in the transmission at low and high frequencies are fabry - perot resonances due to multiple reflections at the crystal interfaces .",
    "the extinction coefficient @xmath17 describes the attenuation of the wave amplitude as it propagates through the medium . in photonic crystals made of non - absorbing constituents , such as those investigated here ,",
    "the extinction of the transmitted amplitude at frequencies within the gap is due to destructive interference of multiply scattered waves . at these frequencies",
    "the wave is bragg reflected and only a small fraction is transmitted through the crystal . according to eq.([transamp ] ) the amplitude decreases exponentially with the crystal thickness and with an attenuation length @xmath24 .",
    "this attenuation length is a direct measure of the photonic strength of the crystal . weakly scattering photonic crystals have attenuation lengths of the order of tens of unit cells , while @xmath25 in strongly scattering crystals is on the order of a few unit cells .",
