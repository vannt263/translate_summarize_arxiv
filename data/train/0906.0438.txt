    "sub - micron scale heat transfer is attracting a growing interest , motivated by both fundamental and technological points of view . in fluids",
    ", considerable attention has been devoted to the so called nanofluids @xcite , in which nanoparticles in dilute suspension appear to modify both bulk heat transfer and critical heat fluxes . while the former effect can presumably be understood in terms of particle aggregation @xcite , the latter is still poorly understood .    more generally , heat transfer from nanoparticles or nanostructures to a fluid environment is a subject of active research , stimulated by the development of experimental techniques such as time resolved optical absorption or reflectivity , or photothermal correlation spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "applications include e.g. the enhancement of cooling from structured surfaces , local heating of fluids by selective absorption from nanoparticles , with possible biomedical hyperthermia uses @xcite .",
    "recent experiments demonstrated the possibility of reaching very high local temperatures using laser heating of nanoparticles @xcite , even reaching the melting point of gold particles suspended in water . from a conceptual point of view , such experiments raise many interesting questions compared to usual , macroscopic heat transfer experiments .",
    "how are the phase diagram and heat transfer equations modified at small scales ? how relevant is the presence of interfacial resistances and how do they change with temperature ?",
    "the case of nanofluids@xcite is a good illustration of the role that can be played by molecular simulation in the interpretation of such complex situations . while many interpretations have been proposed to explain the reported experimental results , it is only simulation of simple models that has been able to disprove some of these interpretations and to demonstrate the validity of the alternative , aggregation scenario .",
    "interestingly , the use of complex models with accurate interaction force fields is not , in general , needed to answer the basic qualitative questions raised by such novel experimental approaches .",
    "in this manuscript , we use molecular simulation to study the heat transfer from solid nanoparticles to a surrounding fluid under extreme conditions ( high heat fluxes ) using both realistic and simplified molecular models .",
    "we show that , in agreement with experiments , the temperature of nanometer sized particles can be elevated considerably without inducing bubble nucleation in the fluid .",
    "this feature is contrasted with the situation for flat surfaces , at which an instability leading to the formation of an insulating vapor layer takes place at much smaller heat fluxes and temperatures @xcite . using a comparison between a `` realistic '' description of gold - octane and gold - water systems and of a simplified lennard - jones model ,",
    "we show , based on a `` corresponding state '' analysis , that the features observed are quite universal .",
    "a simple mapping using critical temperature , interfacial and heat conductivity properties of the particle / solvent pair allows one to reproduce accurately the behavior of different systems .",
    "to establish a connection with experimental reality , we began by using molecular dynamics to simulate heat transfer from a model gold nanoparticle into octane solvent .",
    "the selection of a relatively simple organic solvent in this first part , rather than water , is motivated by the fact that molecular models are quite accurate in predicting liquid - vapor phase diagrams for alkanes .",
    "our model consists of a nanoparticle , with an average radius of about 1.3 nm , containing 494 gold atoms arranged on a fcc lattice with density 19.5 g/@xmath0 .",
    "the nanoparticle is immersed in liquid octane containing 2721 octane molecules ( 21768 united carbon - hydrogen atoms ) and placed in a cubic simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the interactions between united atoms forming octane molecules are described by the amber force - field  @xcite with all non - bonded interaction energy calculated according to 6 - 12 lennard - jones ( lj ) .",
    "the interaction between gold atoms was also described by a 6 - 12 lj potential , fitted to reproduce bulk au density ( 19.5 g/@xmath0 ) and the melting point ( 1310 k ) .",
    "finally , the interaction potential between octane united atoms and gold atoms was adapted from ref .",
    "all simulations were carried out at constant pressure of 1 atmosphere and with the integration time step of 2 fs . in the equilibration stage of the simulation , a global thermostat",
    "is used to maintain the overall temperature at 300 k. the equilibration stage takes approximately 1 ns , and under 1 atm , the equilibrated system is contained in a cubic simulation box with the edge length of about 90 @xmath1 . the nanoparticle is initially placed in the center of the simulation cell , but is allowed to freely diffuse during the simulations . .",
    "the equilibrium density of the model octane fluid is equal to 0.71 g @xmath2 , which compares well with the experimental density of 0.7025 g @xmath2 . to study the heat flow from the nanoparticle to the solvent ,",
    "the nanoparticle was heated , with a constant heating power in the range of 100 - 1000 nw , by rescaling of the atomic velocities every time step . the liquid octane in the periphery of the system , at distances more than 40   from the nanoparticle center ( taking into account a possible diffusive motion ) , was maintained at 300 k , thus providing the heat sink .",
    "up to heating powers of 700 nw , after a transient of about 100 ps , a steady state is established . in the steady state , we collect time averages ( over 1ns ) of density and temperature profiles obtained for spherical shells concentric with the nanoparticle center and with a thickness of 2 . for heating powers",
    "larger than 700 nw , the system was unstable and its behavior will be described below .",

    "[ temp_gold ] .",
    "the temperature profiles have several noteworthy features .",
    "first , the temperature of the nanoparticle is more or less uniform ; this is an effect of the relatively high thermal conductivity of crystalline solid , as compared to liquid .",
    "we mention here , that the electronic contribution to the conductivity , which provides the dominant mechanism of heat conduction within metallic nanoparticles , is not accounted for in our description . the essential point , however , is that the conductivity of the solid is much higher than that of the liquid , independently of the precise mechanism involved .",
    "second , the temperature in the liquid follows the solution of the continuum heat flow problem with spherical symmetry ( see solid lines in fig .  [ temp_gold ] ) .",
    "in the steady state the temperature profile is described by the solution of the laplace equation in the form : @xmath4 near the particle - liquid interface , the temperature profile deviates from the formula given by the eq .",
    "( [ temp_spherical ] ) , particularly for larger heating powers involved .",
    "this deviation is likely due to the non - uniform thermal transport properties of the liquid , since eq .",
    "[ temp_spherical ] is valid under the assumption that the thermal conductivity is constant . very importantly",
    ", there is a large temperature drop , @xmath5 , at the nanoparticle - liquid interface which is a manifestation of the interfacial thermal resistance .",
    "such resistance is caused by the mismatch of thermal properties between the solid and liquid components , and is also affected by the strength of the interfacial bonding .",
    "the interfacial thermal conductance , @xmath6 , can be quantified via the relationship : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the heat flux across the interface and @xmath5 is the discontinuous temperature at the interface ( see temperature profiles in fig .",
    "[ temp_spherical ] ) .",
    "[ conductance_gold ] ( top panel ) shows the relationship between the heating power @xmath9 and the temperature drop at the octane - liquid interface . at lower heating powers",
    "the heat flux is proportional to the heating power , indicating constant value of the interfacial conductance .",
    "however , above the 300nw heating power , the increase in the temperature drop becomes steeper , indicating increasing interfacial thermal resistance ( see fig .",

    ", the value of the interfacial conductance is about 100 mw/@xmath10/k .",
    "this value is similar to those obtained in an experiment on gold nanoparticle - water dispersions  @xcite .",
    "with increasing heat power ( temperature drop ) , the interfacial thermal conductance decreases from 100 to about 50 mw / m@xmath11/k at @xmath12nw . to gain an insight into the structural origin of the behavior , we show in fig .",
    "[ density_gold ] the octane density profiles corresponding to temperature profiles from fig .",
    "[ temp_gold ] . as the temperature of the nanoparticle and the adjacent liquid increases",
    ", there is a visible decrease of liquid density adjacent to the solid surface ( see fig .",
    "[ density_gold ] ) .",
    "this increase of the molecular distance between liquid molecules and solid atoms is likely responsible for the decrease of the interfacial thermal conductance .",
    "( color online ) steady state octane density profiles for octane - gold model system at three heating power levels.,width=226 ]",
    "in order to explore a different type of bonding for the liquid , and also to allow a connection to recent experiments @xcite , we explore in this section a system made of a gold nanoparticle similar to the one described in the previous section , solvated in water modeled using the standard spc / e model @xcite . in order to allow comparisons with the lennard - jones calculations described below , we studied water pressurized at a pressure of 80 bars , and at a temperature of @xmath13 k. these parameters were chosen so that the distance to the critical point is large , but still within a range that allows comparisons between different models .",
    "the system was made of 10000 water molecules .",
    "the main issue here is the choice of the model for the gold - water interaction .",
    "experimentally , the results reported for the wetting of water on gold are quite scattered , with in general a large contact angle hysteresis .",
    "results obtained under uhv conditions @xcite report a low contact angle ( smaller than 30 degrees , or close to a wetting situation ) . on the other hand , the force fields that exist in the literature , and have been based on density functional theory dft calculations @xcite , yield higher contact angles    in this study we make the choice of strengthening the attractive terms in this effective potentials , in order to obtain a contact angle ( estimated from a simple calculation of the lennard - jones contributions to the surface tensions @xcite , and of a the actual value of the spc / e surface tension at 300k ) of the order of 25 degrees , consistent with experiments . as a result",
    ", the gold - water interaction is written in the form of a standard 6 - 12 potential like in @xcite , with the following parameters : @xmath14 kcal.mol@xmath15 and @xmath16 nm , while the hydrogen atoms do not interact with the gold atoms .",
    "the system np + water is first equilibrated during 100 000 time steps which represent a physical time of @xmath17 ps .",
    "then the nanoparticle is heated up at a constant power while the water molecules at a distance 20 from the nanoparticle are thermostated at 450k . in all the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to moderate heating powers ( smaller than 700 nw ) , since for larger heating intensities , we have observed non - stationary effects in the heat transfer process . while these effets are interesting in themselves , their study is out of the scope of this article , and we leave a complete study for future work .",
    "( color online ) temperature profiles across the water - gold nanoparticle interface at three heating strengths.,width=226 ]    temperature profiles of gold np immersed in water , heated at various powers , are shown in figure [ temp_gold_water ] .",
    "clearly , temperature profiles are flatter in water than in octane , if the comparison is made at the same value of the heating power .",
    "this is due to the about 5 times larger conductivity of water compared to octane . on the other hand ,",
    "interfacial temperature jumps @xmath5 are smaller in the water / gold case .",
    "note that it is essential to do the comparison at a given value of the heating power , not at a given value of the nanoparticle temperature .",
    "for instance , for the nanoparticle heated up at @xmath18 nw in octane , we have measured @xmath19 k , while it is a factor of 2 less if the nanoparticle is immersed in water .",
    "consequently , the water / gold interface has a larger interfacial conductance than the octane / gold system .",
    "the value we have measured varies from @xmath20 mw / m@xmath21/k to @xmath22 mw / m@xmath21/k over the range of heating power investigated , a variation that is smaller than in the case of octane .",
    "this trend is consistent with the recent finding that the interfacial conductance increases with work of adhesion , which is higher for the gold - water case than for the gold - octane case .",
    "@xcite the kapitsa length @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the thermal conductivity , is of the order of @xmath25 nm in this case and of @xmath26 nm in the gold / octane case .",
    "at high enough temperatures , experiments have illustrated the possibility of particle melting  @xcite within the fluid .",
    "we also explored briefly this issue in our simulations of gold particle in octane . by inspection",
    ", we observed that up to p = 500 nw , the nanoparticle structure remained crystalline .",
    "however , at p = 600 nw , the crystalline order of the nanoparticle is lost . at p = 700 nw",
    ", we observed that atoms from the nanoparticle surface are gradually `` evaporated '' into the solution . at a later stage",
    "they recombine into small au clusters ( fig .  [ snapshots ] ) .",
    "we note that all these processes occur without formation of a liquid vapor interface , which , as discussed below , is caused by very large laplace pressure .",
    "in fact , using the surface tension of octane at room temperature @xmath27 @xmath28 n / m and a bubble radius of @xmath29=2 nm , one obtains the laplace pressure of @xmath30=2@xmath31/@xmath29 @xmath32 200 atm .",
    "this value is much larger than the critical octane pressure of 25.5 atm .",
    "these results illustrate an exciting possibility of decomposition of metal nanoparticles into metal atoms or small clusters , without explosive evaporation or thermal damage on the embedding medium .",
    "interestingly , we have not observed such fragmentation for nanoparticles immersed in water .",
    "although the crystalline order is lost , the gold nanoparticle keeps its integrity .",
    "this is probably due to the higher interfacial energy of the gold / water interface compared to gold / octane .",
    "to emphasize the generality of the scenario described above , we briefly recall here the results obtained for a generic model of a simple , lennard jones monoatomic fluid in contact with a heated solid particle @xcite .",
    "the system is made of a fcc solid particle formed of 555 atoms , immersed in a fluid of 23000 atoms , all the atoms interacting through a lennard - jones potential @xmath33 where @xmath34 refers to solid or liquid atoms .",
    "the potential has a cut - off radius @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the diameter of the atoms .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath36 are taken to be the same for both phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 if @xmath39 ; @xmath40 otherwise controls the wetting interaction between the fluid and the solid nanoparticle .",
    "in addition to the lennard - jones interactions , atoms inside the particles are connected to their neighbors with fene springs  @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this nearest neighbor bonding allows one to heat up the nanoparticle to rather high temperatures without observing the melting or fragmentation phenomena mentioned above .. in the following , we will concentrate on results obtained for @xmath44 , which will be shown in section [ cs ] to be an appropriate value for a mapping between the lj and gold - octane systems .",
    "the dependence on @xmath45 is discussed in ref .",
    "all results in this section are given in standard lennard - jones units , @xmath46 , @xmath36 and @xmath47 for temperature , length and time , respectively . here",
    "@xmath48 is the mass of the fluid atoms .",
    "we integrate the equations of motion using a velocity verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath49 .",
    "all the systems considered have been first equilibrated at a constant temperature @xmath50 under the constant pressure @xmath51 ( using a nose / hoover temperature thermostat and pressure barostat ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath52 is below the boiling temperature , that we found to be @xmath53 , using independent simulations of a liquid / vapor interface , under the pressure @xmath54 we are working at .",
    "after @xmath55 time steps of equilibration , the nanoparticle is heated up at different temperatures @xmath56 by rescaling the velocities of the solid particles at each time step , while the whole system is kept at the constant pressure @xmath54 using a nph barostat .",
    "the fluid beyond a distance @xmath57 from the particle surface is thermostatted at @xmath50 , again using velocity rescaling .",
    "temperature , density and pressure fields have been obtained by averaging the corresponding quantities during @xmath58 time steps in nanoparticle centered spherical shells of width @xmath59 , after a steady state is reached .",
    "finally , we calculate the heat flux density flowing through the solid particle , by measuring the power supply needed to keep the nanoparticle at the target temperature @xmath60 .",

    "for low @xmath60 , the temperature field in the liquid is practically indistinguishable from the form @xmath66 ( eq .  [ temp_spherical ] ) .",
    "the general behavior is strikingly similar to the one obtained for the gold - octane system . inside the solid ,",
    "the temperature is not uniform but slightly curved downwards , due to the finite conductivity of the nanoparticle . as in the gold / octane simulation ,",
    "the temperature is discontinuous at the interface . for a given value of the nanoparticle temperature @xmath60 ,",
    "the relative temperature jump @xmath5 is quite comparable to the gold - octane results , thus suggesting that the corresponding interfacial conductance is depends on the details of the nanoparticle / fluid interaction mostly trough macroscopic parameters such as the wettability @xcite .. similar indications can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the interfacial conductance of surfactant - water interfaces is directly proportional to the work of adhesion .",
    "for instance , for the nanoparticle heated up at @xmath65 , we have measured a temperature jump @xmath67 which is quite comparable to the value reported in fig .",
    "[ conductance_gold ] for the gold nanoparticle for the @xmath18 nw heating power .",
    "similarly , the value of the conductance obtained @xmath68 is consistent with the gold / octane results displayed in fig .",
    "[ conductance_gold ] , if we assume that a value of @xmath69 in our lj units corresponds to an interfacial conductance on the order of @xmath70 mw / k / m@xmath11 .",
    "all these results suggest that the interfacial conductance is a quantity which does not strongly depend on the details of the nanoparticle / fluid interaction but only on generic properties of an interface as _",
    "e.g _ the wettability .",
    "this correspondance between the simplified lennard - jones system and the more realistic description of gold in octane will be explored further in the next section .",
    "we also mention briefly that very high flux situations can be explored here thanks to the `` covalent '' bonding introduced between the atoms of the solid particle . upon increasing the temperature of the nanoparticle ,",
    "deviations from the @xmath71 behavior are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ temperatureprofile ] , when the local temperature exceeds the critical temperature @xmath61 .",
    "interestingly , the temperature profile steepens close to the nanoparticle surface , corresponding to a decrease of the local effective conductivity .. the density profile @xcite differs somewhat from its octane or water counterparts , with density oscillations in the case of the monoatomic lj fluid .",
    "these oscillations are smeared out for a molecular liquid .",
    "the most important point is that , even far above the critical point , we do not observe a steep decrease of the liquid density in the vicinity of the particle , but rather the appearance of a dilute liquid layer , with a density decreasing when the nanoparticle gets hotter .",
    "note however that the density within this layer is still one order of magnitude larger than the vapor density at coexistence .",
    "thus , even at temperatures several times @xmath61 , boiling of the surrounding fluid is not observed .",
    "obviously , the qualitative similarities between the observations in the previous sections points to a rather generic scenario . in order to allow a more quantitative comparison , a mapping between the different systems is necessary .",
    "the mapping we investigate will be based on the physical properties that dominate the problem under consideration , namely interfacial effects , liquid vapor coexistence and heat transfer in the liquid phase .",
    "we start by a discussion of the gold - octane case , which in view of the rather similar interactions can be expected to be easily mapped onto a lennard - jones system .",
    "the first step is to tune the interaction coefficient between fluid and solid , @xmath45 , to a value that is best suited to reproduce the properties of the gold octane interface . generally speaking",
    ", the wetting properties of an interface can be related to the interaction potential @xmath72 through the interfacial work  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a minimal radius of approach between two molecules , @xmath75 and @xmath76 denoting the number densities of the interacting media .",
    "the wetting properties ( equilibrium contact angle or spreading parameter ) will be determined by the ratio @xmath77 . in the gold octane system , this ratio is : @xmath78 . in the latter expression , @xmath79 mol.@xmath2 and",
    "@xmath80 mol.@xmath2 are the gold and fluid number densities , @xmath81=0.429 kcal.mol@xmath15 ; @xmath82=0.143 kcal.mol@xmath15 are the octane united atoms / gold and octane / fluid interaction energies @xcite , while @xmath83=0.328 nm ; @xmath84=0.3923 nm are the radii of the corresponding interaction .",

    "in particular , the slopes of the temperature profile ( flux ) at the solid interfaces are quite comparable .",

    "this difference is probably due to the more complex structure of the gold - water interface , which implies that a simple matching based on identifying the @xmath62 parameters is not appropriate .",

    "that this is the case may seem obvious , as the main macroscopic parameters have been matched .",

    "we have explored the phenomenon of heat transfer in the vicinity of strongly heated nanoparticles , using molecular dynamics simulations of atomically realistic models or of more coarse grained lennard - jones monoatomic fluids .",
    "the comparison between the two approaches shows that , provided the mapping is carried out using the physically relevant properties , they are quantitatively equivalent .",
    "the simulations reveal that the fluid in the vicinity of the nanoparticles can sustain very high heat fluxes and large temperature differences without undergoing the type of drying instability that is observed on flat surfaces , and that temperatures much above the critical temperatures can be reached without observing phase coexistence . in the case of gold in octane , high heat fluxes and temperatures can result in a partial desintegration of the nanoparticle , while in the gold in water case they only result in melting of the particle for comparable heating powers ..    the phenomena that are involved in such experiments are quite complex , with a combination of phase transition , interfacial phenomena and transport phenomena , all taking place on the nanometer scale .",
    "it is therefore not trivial , that a simple coarse graining based on a matching of interface and thermal properties results in a correct description of the phenomenon .",
    "this implies that coarse grained methods should be appropriate for describing similar phenomena in nanostructures of larger dimensions ( e.g. aggregates of nanoparticles , or nanostructured surfaces ) .",

    "<S> in this contribution , we study situations in which nanoparticles in a fluid are strongly heated , generating high heat fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is relevant to experiments in which a fluid is locally heated using selective absorption of radiation by solid particles . </S>",
    "<S> we first study this situation for different types of molecular interactions , using models for gold particles suspended in octane and in water . as already reported in experiments , very high heat fluxes and temperature elevations ( leading eventually to particle destruction ) </S>",
    "<S> can be observed in such situations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a very simple modeling based on lennard - jones interactions captures the essential features of such experiments , and that the results for various liquids can be mapped onto the lennard - jones case , provided a physically justified ( corresponding state ) choice of parameters is made . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the possibility of sustaining very high heat fluxes is related to the strong curvature of the interface that inhibits the formation of an insulating vapor film . </S>"
