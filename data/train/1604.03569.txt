    "these fast molecular jets only appear in the very youngest , class 0 protostellar objects , suggesting that molecular jets are short - lived .",
    "however , atomic jets with velocities of several @xmath3 100 can be seen after the class 0 phase in optical and infrared tracers toward evolved t tauri stars such as hl tau and xz tau @xcite .",

    "the 1.35ghz of dust continuum bandwidth comprise both dedicated continuum windows as well as the portions of spectral line windows that were uncontaminated by line emission ; the windows range in frequency from @xmath0216232ghz .",
    "the dust continuum image , most clearly seen in figure [ fig : alma_vla ] ( right ) , was produced by using the casa task * clean * to combine the data from the two configurations using multi - scale * clean * with a weighting parameter of robust=0 .",

    "the window had a velocity resolution of 0.6 ; the center of the window was doppler - corrected to be the line s rest frequency of 230.538ghz .",

    "the most striking feature is the wide - angle cavity  to the se of smm1-a , shaped like a backwards `` c , '' and with a @xmath02@xmath8 diameter  detected both at 4 cm ( vla ) and at 1.3 mm ( alma ) . emanating from within the cavity is a one - sided , redshifted ehv co jet ( @xmath03080 relative to smm1 s = 9 ) driven by smm1-a . in figure",
    "[ fig : alma_vla ] , a separate ehv jet can be seen in emission extending to the nnw ; our data confirm definitively that this jet emanates from smm1-b .",
    "the jets from smm1-a and smm1-b are both monopolar ( and redshifted ) , presumably because of the geometry of the surrounding cloud .",
    "monopolar outflows have been seen before ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but their origin is still unclear .",

    "these two co features are not perfectly collinear ; furthermore , the four main radio knots are not all collinear .",
    "@xcite suggest that the precession of the jet could cause this non - collinearity ; they attribute the precession to an unresolved 3au binary within smm1-a and calculate a precession period of 2030yr and a precession angle of 10@xmath7 ( i.e. , the angle between the central jet axis and the line of maximal deviation from that axis ) .",
    "in addition to the ehv co jet , there is also wide - angle , _ low - velocity _ redshifted co emission to the se of the source ( see figure [ fig : co_low ] ) ; this emission is consistent with the low - velocity co reported in ( * ? ? ? * figure 27 ) .",
    "the low - velocity co along the walls of the cavity may have been accelerated outward by a low - velocity , wide - angle wind that is distinct from the ehv jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although no ehv co emission is apparent from the blueshifted lobe of the outflow , figure [ fig : co_low ] shows low - velocity co emission that is coincident with the ionized jet that extends in the nw direction .",
    "the asymmetry of both the ehv co and the ionized jets are puzzling , and will be investigated in more depth in a future paper .",
    "the coincidence of the centimeter emission with the millimeter dust emission in the cavity is unexpected , as previous observations have shown free - free emission to be confined to protostellar jets .",
    "this begs the question : could the centimeter emission be from dust as well ? to address this question we calculated the spectral index of the emission from the cavity by fitting the fluxes from the 1.3 mm data from alma , 7 mm data from the vla from @xcite , and the 4 cm vla data .. the fluxes were calculated by summing the fluxes in two circular 1@xmath8 areas placed on the northern and southern cavity lobes .",

    "both shocks and uv ionization could cause the free - free emission seen in the cavity around the ehv jet .",
    "uv ionization and shocks from winds of various speeds are expected to be common phenomena in ysos @xcite .",
    "we explore three scenarios involving these two mechanisms : the ionization could be caused by ( 1 ) uv radiation produced by accretion of material onto the central protostar ; ( 2 ) material from a precessing jet interacting with the cavity walls on a timescale shorter than the free - free cooling time ; or ( 3 ) shocks from wide - angle winds .",
    "the slow component of the outflow has clearly evacuated a cavity even wider than the one seen in free - free emission ( see figure [ fig : co_low ] ) , which could allow uv radiation produced near the protostar to escape and ionize the cavity walls @xcite .",
    "we explore the possibility that uv radiation produced from the accretion of material onto the protostar could produce the free - free emission we see toward both the central source and the ionized cavity that lies @xmath0800au from the central source .",
    "the rate of ionizing , lyman - continuum photons required to sustain a given amount of free - free emission is as follows @xcite :    @xmath13    the free - free emission from the central source and the cavity in smm1 has an integrated flux density of @xmath14@xmath152mjy at @xmath16ghz . assuming a distance to the source @xmath4pc , an electron temperature @xmath17k , and a flux of purely ly - continuum photons with energies of 13.6ev , the lyman continuum flux required to produce the free - free emission from smm1 is @xmath18 .",
    "based on results from @xcite , a classical t tauri star s typical far - uv ( fuv ) luminosity , which is dominated by accretion , is between roughly @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the results from @xcite show that only @xmath01% of the fuv emission is in the lyman continuum ( 13.6ev ) ; the rest is in the ly - alpha line ( 10.2ev ) .",

    ", the radiation field at @xmath0800au ( the distance from the central source to the cavity ) would be @xmath27 .",
    "this is approximately @xmath28 times the interstellar fuv radiation field @xmath29 @xcite . ]",
    "note that equation [ eqn : uv ] does not take optical depth into account . assuming a constant volume density of @xmath03000@xmath30 within the outflow cavity @xcite , the total column density out to 800au is @xmath31@xmath32 , or @xmath00.02 @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to an optical depth in the uv of @xmath34 , or an attenuation of only 6% percent of the uv radiation @xcite . for a cavity column density of @xmath35@xmath30",
    ", attenuation increases to @xmath020% .",
    "thus , if the cavity densities are @xmath36@xmath35@xmath30 , we can safely ignore uv attenuation .",
    "however , even if the density within the cavity is higher than @xmath35@xmath30 , smm1 has a much larger mass , accretion rate , and fuv luminosity than even df tau , the brightest source in the sample from @xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the free - free emission from both the central source and the cavity is a result of ionization by uv radiation created by the accretion shock .",
    "figure [ fig : co_multiple ] shows that the orientation and physical extent of the highest velocity co emission ( 6378 ) are substantially different from those of the lower velocity emission ( 3357 ) .",
    "the differing orientations are evidence of the jet s @xmath020yr precession through a @xmath010@xmath7 angle @xcite ; the slightly different emission extents and velocities are most likely the result of projection effects brought about by the precession .",

    "it is therefore plausible that shocks from the ehv jet interacting with the cavity wall could produce the free - free emission we observe .",
    "finally , the ionization in the cavity could be caused by shocking of material from a ( fast and undetected ) wide - angle wind with the cavity walls .",
    "fast ( @xmath0100 ) , wide - angle winds such as x - winds @xcite or disk winds @xcite are predicted to exist alongside collimated jets @xcite , and have been detected before in older , class i protostars in a variety of atomic and ionized tracers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "rather , they argue that ionization could arise from one of two scenarios : ( 1 ) from winds that are episodic in time and direction , and thus fail to disrupt the core , or ( 2 ) a combination of a slow wind and uv radiation from the protostar itself .",
    "we have reported the highest resolution and highest sensitivity millimeter - wave observations to date of the intermediate - mass protostar serpens smm1 .",
    "the alma data show a one - sided , extremely high - velocity ( @xmath080 ) jet powered flanked at the base by a wide - angle cavity seen in 4 cm free - free emission detected by the vla .",
    "this is the first time that ionization of an outflow cavity has been directly detected via free - free emission in a very young , embedded class 0 protostellar source that is still powering a molecular jet .",
    "the two most likely scenarios that could lead to the ionization of the outflow cavity are : ( 1 ) the cavity walls are ionized by uv photons escaping from the accreting protostellar source , or ( 2 ) material from the precessing molecular jet is impacting the walls and ionizing them via shocks .",
    "we find both of these scenarios to be plausible  and indeed , the ionization may be caused by a combination of the two , as predicted in various studies .",
    "if the main cause of the cavity s ionization is shocks from the precessing jet and the jet does indeed precess appreciably on a @xmath020yr timescale , future alma and vla observations could confirm whether the free - free emission , dust continuum , or the ehv co emission change with time .",
    "furthermore , with the exquisite sensitivity of the vla , it should be possible to detect ionized outflow cavities toward other bright , class 0 protostellar sources , enhancing our knowledge of the radiation , outflow , and jet environments in the youngest , most embedded forming stars .",
