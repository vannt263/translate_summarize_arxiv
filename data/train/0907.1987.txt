    "since the first experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of diluted atomic gases , the dynamics of matter waves in different trapping potentials has attracted the attention of many researchers and presently is a field of growing interest @xcite .",
    "the dispersive properties of bec induced by the quantum properties of a slow atomic motion , on one side , and the intrinsic nonlinearity of the system induced by the interatomic interactions , on the other side , make becs ideal systems for exploring competing effects of dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "this results in a variety of spectacular phenomena ranging from the existences of matter wave vortices @xcite and solitons @xcite to dispersive shocks @xcite .    in the standard mean field approximation @xcite the bec dynamics",
    "is governed by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath0 for the condensate `` wave function '' @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the potential of the external forces trapping the condensate . in the standard gp approximation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nonlinear interaction parameter expressed in terms of the @xmath5-wave scattering length @xmath6 of atoms with mass @xmath7 . in this approximation ,",
    "only two - body collisions are taken into account .",
    "the scattering length @xmath6 , however , can be varied and even made equal to zero by means of feshbach resonances",
    ". then contribution of multi - particle ( three - body ) collisions becomes comparable with the two - body contribution and a more complicated form of the nonlinear term , such as @xmath8 arises in the gp equation .",
    "although the three - dimensional gp equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) is too complicated for analytical studies , one can often consider experimental low dimensional settings , e.g. cigar - shaped traps with a strong radial confinement , for which the radial motion of the bec is `` frozen '' and eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 1 ] ) reduces to an effective 1d cubic - quintic generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite , @xmath9 ( here standard non - dimensional variables have been introduced , holding the previous notation for convenience ) . in this reduction ,",
    "the function @xmath10 , preserves its form ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) up to a renormalization of the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "also note that the conservation of the norm of the condensate wave function ( normalized number of atoms ) is guaranteed for arbitrary functions @xmath13 .",
    "more complicated form of the function @xmath13 can arise if we take into account the radial motion of bec ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we arrive at the problem of 1d dynamics of bec with generalized form of the nonlinearity @xmath13 and confined in the axial direction @xmath14 by the trap @xmath15 .    as is well known , in case of @xmath13 given by eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 2 ] ) with @xmath16 ( repulsive two body interaction ) and under the assumption of negligible changes of the potential @xmath15 in the region of @xmath14 under consideration , the nls equation ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) , has a dark soliton solution corresponding to the motion of a hole in the density distribution function , @xmath17 , along a uniform distribution @xmath18 with constant velocity @xmath19 which depends on the depth of the soliton @xcite .",
    "if the potential @xmath15 is a slowly varying function for distances of the order of the soliton s width , then the coordinate of the soliton is well defined and we can speak about value of the potential @xmath15 at the `` point '' @xmath14 of the soliton position . in this case",
    "we can formulate the problem of motion of a dark soliton `` in the potential '' @xmath15 in terms of its collective coordinate .",
    "this problem has been addressed in several papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where it was shown that the dynamics of dark solitons is quite nontrivial .",
    "in particular , if a bec described by the standard gp equation ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) is confined in a harmonic axial trap , @xmath20 then the dark soliton oscillates inside the condensate with the frequency @xcite @xmath21 this result is quite surprising because apparently it contradicts to a simple consequence of the ehrenfest theorem which says that the center of mass of the whole bec always oscillates with the trap frequency @xmath22 . the remarkable theoretical prediction ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) was confirmed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) then implies that the motion of the dark soliton must be accompanied by a deformation of the density distribution which re - tunes the oscillation of the whole condensate to the trap frequency . in this situation",
    "the motion of the dark soliton becomes `` decoupled '' from the motion of the center of mass and the ehrenfest theorem is not violated .",
    "however , the result ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) is not universal .",
    "if the nonlinearity function is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 , then the frequency @xmath25 of oscillations of a shallow dark soliton coincides with the trap frequency @xcite , @xmath26 and for deep solitons this frequency is given by a more complicated expression ( see @xcite ) @xmath27 this observation poses the problem of the dark soliton motion in the case of a more general form of the nonlinearity .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address this problem by considering a non - uniform cigar - shaped bec with nonlinear interactions modeled by an arbitrary function @xmath13 of the density .",
    "in particular we consider the physically relevant example of the cubic - quintic nonlinearity function in ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) , modeling the mean field effect of the two - body and three - body collisions in the gp equation . in this case",
    "we find that the relative contribution of the two nonlinear terms to the soliton oscillation depends on the background density @xmath28 : if a deep soliton oscillates in vicinity of the maximum @xmath28 of the density distribution , then for @xmath29 its frequency must be equal to ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) , and for @xmath30 to ( [ 3 - 5 ] ) .",
    "the transition from one limiting case to another is of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the oscillation frequency of a deep dark solitons which reveals the explicit dependence of the oscillations frequency both on the background density and on the strength of the nonlinearity parameters .",
    "our formulae reproduce the results considered in @xcite for the particular cases ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) of the nonlinearity for which the above dependence disappears .",
    "we also consider the case of a quintic attractive nonlinearity ( @xmath31 ) with an overall repulsive interaction . in this case for the density @xmath32 we get modulation instability of bec , i.e. the sound velocity @xmath33 becomes imaginary so that the notion of `` dark solitons '' looses its sense .",
    "we show that in this case the oscillation frequency @xmath25 as a function of @xmath28 becomes singular at @xmath34 .",
    "the form of this singularity may provide further advances in the understanding of the dynamics of dark solitons in bec .",
    "our theory will be based on the elegant approach of refs .",
    "@xcite where the dark soliton was considered as a `` landau quasi - particle '' whose motion in the stationary potential @xmath15 is governed by the quasi - particle s `` energy conservation '' law in close analogy with the newtonian particle motion .",
    "the generalization of this approach to arbitrary @xmath13 allows us to derive the equation of motion of the dark soliton for the general case and to show the dependence of the soliton effective mass on the system parameters .",
    "a comparison between analytical results and direct numerical simulations of the cubic - quintic gp equation shows a very good agrement which further confirms the validity of our analysis .",
    "we finally remark that the dependence of the dark soliton oscillation frequency on the system parameters can be very useful for experimental studies of relative contribution of multi - particle collisions into bec dynamics by varying the value of @xmath11 by means of feshbach resonance .",
    "moreover , it gives the possibility to measure background densities or scattering lengths directly from the dark soliton dynamics .",
    "the possibility to manage soliton oscillations via temporal changes of the scattering lengths is also an attractive feature emerging from our study which could be of interest for practical applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the general theory of the dynamics of a dark soliton of the nls equation with an arbitrary nonlinearity .",
    "the results will be used to study the cases of both deep and shallow soliton dynamics . in section iii",
    "we consider oscillations of dark solitons for the specific case of a cubic - quintic nonlinearity .",
    "we consider the cases of a repulsive cubic nonlinearity and either repulsive or attractive quintic nonlinearity , the last being done for parameters satisfying the condition of modulation stability of bec . in section",
    "iv analytical results will be compared with direct numerical simulations of the cubic - quintic gp equation for the case of repulsive and attractive cubic and quintic nonlinearity , respectively . in the last section",
    "we draw our conclusions and summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "first , we have to find the soliton solution of the generalized nls equation ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) with zero potential @xmath35 but under the boundary condition that the condensate density @xmath36 tends to the limiting background density @xmath28 as @xmath37 and the condensate s velocity vanishes at infinity . to this end",
    ", it is convenient to look for the solution in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the chemical potential of the condensate and its density @xmath40 and the local flow velocity @xmath41 depend only on the variable @xmath42 with @xmath19 being the soliton velocity .",
    "the formulated above boundary conditions take the form @xmath43 substitution of ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) into ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) with @xmath35 and separation of real and imaginary parts yields the system of two equations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "one of these equations can be integrated at once to give @xmath46 where the integration constant is chosen according to the conditions ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) .",
    "then the second equation can be transformed to @xmath47 and this equation can also be integrated once . as a result",
    "we obtain the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49d\\rho'-4v^2(\\rho_0-\\rho)^2\\ ] ] and again the integration constant is chosen according to the condition ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have reduced the problem of finding the density profile to the inversion of the integral @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the minimal density at the center @xmath52 of the soliton .",
    "the function @xmath53 has a double zero at @xmath18 and the condition @xmath54 reproduces the relation ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) . at @xmath55",
    "the function @xmath53 has a single zero , and this condition yields the relationship between @xmath51 and the soliton velocity @xmath19 , @xmath56 where @xmath57d\\rho'\\ ] ] is the function ( [ 5 - 3 ] ) with zero value of the velocity @xmath19 and we have used here eq .",

    "then in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation the density @xmath36 is a function of @xmath14 determined implicitly by the equation @xmath70 when this tf distribution of the density @xmath71 is substituted into ( [ 6 - 4 ] ) instead of @xmath28 , we obtain the energy of the soliton moving with velocity @xmath19 and located at this moment at the point @xmath14 . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the velocity @xmath19 changes during the motion of the dark soliton in such a way that the soliton energy ( [ 6 - 4 ] ) is conserved .",
    "if we denote the soliton coordinate as @xmath72 , then @xmath73 and eq .",
    "( [ 6 - 4 ] ) converts into @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the initial energy of the soliton . since the function @xmath76 is known , eq .",

    "we shall consider the most interesting limiting cases admitting complete analytical study .",
    "let us consider oscillations of a deep soliton , @xmath79 where @xmath28 is the maximal density of the condensate at its `` top '' when it is confined in a trap with the potential @xmath15 ( see ( [ 6 - 5 ] ) ) . in this case",
    "the amplitude of oscillations is much less than the tf radius of the condensate and the velocity of its motion is much less than the local sound velocity @xmath80 therefore , if we expand the energy into series with respect to small amplitude and velocity , then the first nontrivial terms in ( [ 6 - 6 ] ) will give the expression @xmath81 where @xmath82 changes little for the small amplitude vibrations .",
    "hence , we get the `` energy conservation law '' for a newtonian particle moving in the potential @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the effective mass of the dark soliton .    for small @xmath19",
