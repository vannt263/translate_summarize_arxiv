    "the hypothesis that herbig ae / be stars ( haebe ; herbig 1960 ) are intermediate mass pre - main - sequence stars is today generally accepted . has been given more credibility in recent years by interferometric observations at millimeter wavelengths ( mannings & sargent 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "all the observed hae stars have large near - infrared emission in excess of the photospheric one with very similar dependence on wavelength , that can be described as a near - infrared `` bump '' : the excess monochromatic luminosity @xmath0f@xmath1  is negligible around 1 @xmath2 m , peaks around 2 @xmath2 m  and decreases slowly with wavelength to about 8@xmath2 m , where the silicate emission feature starts ( meeus et al .",
    "2001 ; natta et al .",
    "these stars have very little extinction , so that reddening in the near - infrared is negligible .",
    "the negligible opacity of the inner disk region , required to explain the near - infrared bump is not consistent with the high accretion rates necessary to account for the large near - infrared excess , as discussed by hartmann , kenyon & calvet ( 1993 ) .",
    "these authors suggested that , given the difficulties of applying disk models to haebe stars , one should consider the hypothesis that the emission originates in a dusty very small grains transiently heated by ultraviolet photons .",
    "this possibility , however , has been ruled out by theoretical models ( natta & krgel 1995 ) and by iso observations ( meeus et al . 2001 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the near - infrared behaviour of hae stars has recently been proposed by natta et al .",
    "as expected , these models fail to explain the observations in the near - infrared .",
    "however , natta et al .  have noticed that , if one truncates the disk at a certain radius ( i.e.  introduce a hole ) , .",
    "this inner rim will have a covering fraction around the star , and it will acquire a temperature much hotter than what the disk interior at the same radius would be . this is because the disk receives the stellar radiation under a small grazing angle , and will therefore be relatively cool , while the inner rim is in full sight of the star and will therefore be hot .",
    "in fact , if one assumes that the inner edge of the disk is naturally located at the radius where dust grains acquire their evaporation temperature , then the emission from this inner rim is going to produce a near - infrared bump very reminiscent of the observed one in shape and intensity .    in this paper",
    "we wish to proceed further along this path , and investigate a number of issues that have not been addressed by natta et al .",
    "firstly , we will formalize the description of the structure of a disk with a large inner radius , using the cg97 as a starting point .",
    "in particular , we wish to investigate how the presence of the hot inner rim modifies structure and appearance of the rest of the disk .",
    "since the inner rim is much hotter than the cg97 disk at the same radius , its vertical scale height will be larger as well .",
    "in other words , the inner rim of the disk will puff - up .",
    "this will enhance the near - infrared emission , but also cast a shadow over the disk behind it .",
    "part of the disk which would normally be directly illuminated by the stellar radiation , will now be in the shadow , and therefore collapse and cease to emit ir radiation . at large enough radii , it is possible that the flaring shape of the cg97 disks will be conserved , and that the disk will grow the shadow , unchanged by the presence of the rim .",
    "we thus propose a scenario in which the emission from the reprocessing disk comes from a hot inner rim , caused by dust evaporation , plus the non - shadowed part of a truncated cg97 disk .    a second point we will discuss concerns the behaviour of the near - infrared emission as function of the spectral type of the star .",
    "the ir spectra of t tauri stars ( tts ) are well described by disk models with small or zero inner holes ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; kenyon , yi & hartmann 1996 ) and moderate accretion rates ( gullbring et al .",
    "the few known pre - main - sequence stars of spectral type f and g seem closer in properties to tts than to hae stars ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 ; hartmann et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we show that this behaviour can be explained by the same disk models and that it is caused by a combination of effects .",
    "first of all , the relative importance of the nir bump emission from the inner edge in comparison to the disk emission is smaller for stars of later spectral type . secondly , the stellar atmospheric spectrum shifts towards longer wavelengths as the effective temperature of the star decreases , swamping the rim emission .",
    "finally , it is possible that tts have on average higher accretion rates , and therefore more optically thick inner disks , than hae stars .",
    "in this section we will derive the equations governing the structure of a passively irradiated circumstellar disk with an inner hole .",
    "the main effect of the inner hole on the disk structure is a vertical boundary which is irradiated directly by the star , heating it to temperatures higher than what would be expected at the same location for a thin disk with grazing irradiation only . because of the higher temperature",
    ", the disk boundary will be puffed up , and the material immediately outside the inner rim will be shadowed , leading to a decreasing scale height . at large distances from the star it is possible that the disk becomes high enough to emerge from the shadow of the inner rim , in which case it may continue to flare like a disk without a puffed - up inner rim .",
    "however , it is not certain that the disk will be able to leave the shadow .",
    "this is a dynamical question and the answer may depend upon the history of the disk and many other parameters ( e.g.  was the disk flaring when the inner boundary started to emerge and to puff up ? ) .",
    "figure [ fig - disk - hole - geometry ] shows our scenario , where we assume that the flared part of the disk exists when it can .    we will divide the disk structure calculations in three parts ( inner rim , shadowed region , and flared component ) and derive the basic equations governing the structure in the three regions .",
    "we start with the well - known flared part .      for the the flaring part of the disk we follow the line of chiang & goldreich ( cg97 ) with some minor modifications . for completeness , and in order to introduce the nomenclature we repeat the basic equations without physical discussion .",
    "direct stellar radiation impinges onto the disk at an angle @xmath3 given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radius of the star , @xmath6 the distance from the star in the disk plane and @xmath7 the height of the disk photosphere above the midplane .",
    "anticipating a nearly powerlaw behavior , we replace @xmath8 .",
    "we can thus rewrite the expression for @xmath3 as : @xmath9 the stellar flux impinging with this angle into the disk is : @xmath10 this equation assumes that the entire star is visible from the considered point on the disk surface .",
    "if the disk would stretch all the way to the star , the bottom half of the star would not be visible and a correction would have to be made .",
    "however , since we consider disks with large inner holes , the transition from the star being invisible to the star being fully visible will be sharp , and we ignore this effect .",
    "@xmath11    the disk will be almost isothermal in the vertical direction , leading to a gaussian density distribution with a constant pressure scale height @xmath12 given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 is the virial temperature at the stellar surface .",
    "the ratio of the disk surface height @xmath7 to the pressure scale height @xmath12 is a dimensionless number @xmath15 of order unity : @xmath16 usually this @xmath15 will lie somewhere in between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "but it can be self - consistently determined from the grazing angle @xmath3 , the surface density @xmath19 and the planck mean opacity at the stellar temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the way to do this will be described in appendix [ app : subsec - cg - finetune - chi ] .",
    "[ [ subsec - surfacelayer ] ]    is defined as the layer of matter in direct sight of the central star up to grazing optical depth @xmath21 , the temperature in this layer can be estimated from the optically thin expression : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of the planck mean opacities at @xmath24 and @xmath25 . .",
    "the planck mean opacity is defined as @xmath26 the flux from the surface layer in both the upwards and the downwards direction is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the surface density of the layer .",
    "energy conservation implies @xmath29 , so the surface density of the layer is : @xmath30      we assume in the following that the disk is truncated on the inside by dust evaporation .",
    "the disk may continue towards the star in purely gaseous form , but , as long as the gas is optically thin to the stellar radiation , we can neglect its effects and describe the disk structure as if it has a true inner hole .",
    "the inner disk radius @xmath31 is determined by requiring that the disk temperature equals the dust evaporation temperature , which we take @xmath32 .",
    "the inner rim of the disk exposes a vertical surface to direct stellar radiation and will therefore be hotter than disk model at the same radius . for a given inner radius @xmath31 of the disk , the blackbody temperature of the rim",
    "is : @xmath33 which is derived by equating the emitted blackbody flux @xmath34 to the received flux from direct stellar radiation @xmath35 .",
    "the factor @xmath36 approximately accounts for the effect of self - irradiation , i.e.  irradiation of the rim by its own emission .",
    "the vertical height of the inner rim , @xmath37 , is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pressure scale height at the inner rim @xmath40    by equating @xmath41 one can solve for @xmath31 by writing eq.([eq - trim - given - rin ] ) as @xmath42 and iterate until convergence .",
    "if the self - irradiation can be ignored ( @xmath43 ) , then no iteration is needed . however , as it turns out , for most haebe stars the ratio @xmath44 ( which is the covering fraction of the inner rim ) is of the order of @xmath45 to @xmath46 , and therefore the effects of self - irradiation can not be ignored .",
    "the inner rim will always be significantly higher than the disk height , because it is hotter by a factor of at least @xmath47 .",
    "in general this will roughly yield a puffing - up ratio of @xmath48 .",
    "the disk material immediately behind this inner rim will therefore be deprived of direct stellar light , since the rim casts a shadow over the disk behind it .",
    "this region of the disk is cooler than predicted by cg97 models , and . only at much larger distance , where the disk comes out of the inner rim shadow and",
    "is illuminated again by the stellar light , flaring may occur .",
    "since the shadow covers every point @xmath49 for which @xmath50 , the radius @xmath51 at which the disk can again be described by the cg97 model is computed by solving the following equation : @xmath52 for @xmath53 , the most important sources of irradiation are the near - infrared emission of the rim itself and the fraction of stellar light that is scattered toward the disk by the edge of the rim , or by a halo of dust surrounding the star+disk system ( natta 1994 ) .",
    "in addition to this , radiative diffusion can exchange energy between neigboring annuli .",
    "however , rough estimates of these effects show that the radiation emitted by this shadowed region of the disk is negligible compared to the emission of the rim and of the outer disk , directly heated by the star .    however , the disk structure immediately behind the inner rim is of importance for our discussion , because we need it in order to estimate the quantity @xmath54 in eq.(12 ) , i.e.  the ratio of the photospheric to the pressure scale height at @xmath31 ( see appendix  [ app : sec : surface - height - at - inner - rim ] ) . at this location of the disk none of the irradiation sources",
    "play any significant role .",
    "instead , direct radiative diffusion from the inner rim will dominate the energy balance there ( see fig .  [ fig - diffusion - rim ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to determine exactly what the structure of the disk is in this diffusive region , but a simple model for this will be provided below .    the inner rim of the diffusive region receives direct starlight .",
    "this radiation is absorbed and re - emitted by the dust grains .",
    "some of this radiation will once again be absorbed and re - emitted . in the end , most radiation will , after one or more absorption / re - emission events escape from the hot inner rim surface .",
    "but a small fraction of the radiation remains trapped within the disk and diffuses towards larger radii .",
    "the diffusive flux is proportional to the gradient of the temperature of the disk s interior .",
    "since it is expected that the temperature has a net decrease outwards , there will be an outward pointing diffusive flux .",
    "as a package of energy has moved one towards larger radii , it has had an equal chance of having escaped from the disk s surface .",
    "this is true for each surface height it travels outwards .",
    "the differential equation for the disk s temperature would be : @xmath55 @xmath56 this equation can be solved numerically .",
    "this would be of course unphysical , and before this happens , other heating mechanisms will have taken over , such as the ring emission mentioned above , light scattering off a spherical halo surrounding the disk+star system , interstellar radiation or viscous dissipation .",
    "describes the diffusion of energy inwards from the still flaring part of the disk into the shadowed region .      for an accurate determination of the disk structure in the flared region one should include this secondary irradiation .",
    "we consider the inner rim as a cylinder .",
    "the irradiative flux is then ( see appendix [ app : projsurf ] ) : @xmath57 \\fullstop \\end{split}\\ ] ] equated to the disk s reemission flux @xmath58 ( eq.[eq - emit - flux - interior ] ) , thus yielding the corrected value of @xmath59 .",
    "once the disk structure is known , one can compute the emerging spectrum . in principle one",
    "requires a 2-d ( axially symmetric ) ray - tracing program to compute the sed at various inclination angles .",
    "this is because the disk structure , in particular for haebe stars , is far from being flat , and self - occultation is a real possiblity ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) . yet , in this section we shall use a simplified treatment of inclination , therefore limiting ourselves to inclinations that are not too edge - on .",
    "the determination of the spectral components from the flaring part of the disk is relatively straightforward , and has been described fully by cg97 .",
    "we confine ourselves here to a quick reference of the equations .",

    "this equation remains valid at wavelengths where the disk interior becomes optically thin .",

    "\\kappa_\\nu\\frac{r}{d^2}\\,dr \\comma \\end{split}\\ ] ]      the inner rim is assumed to be a cylinder emitting on its inner side as a blackbody with temperature @xmath65 . to compute the emission from this rim we have to include inclination effects .",
    "clearly , if @xmath63 ( face - on ) , then the emission from the rim is zero ( although in reality the rim may be more rounded - off , and therefore also visible at face - on inclination ) . for @xmath66",
    "( edge - on ) the emission is also zero , because the rim is self - occulting .",
    "the projected surface , as seen by an observer at inclination @xmath62 is given by eq.([eq - flux - from - rim - incl - dsmall ] ) .",
    "for not - too - large inclination angles we are in the regime @xmath67 and one can then write : @xmath68",
    "the total luminosity of the rim equals @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the covering factor of the rim ( i.e.  the fraction of the sky covered by the rim as seen from the perspective of the star ) . for large @xmath71",
    "this will therefore give a strong contribution to the sed .",
    "to illustrate the general features of our model we set up an example model consisting of a star , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( we take the stellar spectrum to be a blackbody for simplicity ) , and a disk with outer radius @xmath74 and inner radius at the dust condensation point ( @xmath75 ) , which for this setup is at @xmath76 . .",
    "the disk is seen at an inclination angle @xmath77 .",
    "we take a simple model for our dust opacity : a mixture of amorphous carbon and astronomical silicate in a ratio @xmath78 .",
    "the amorphous carbon opacity is computed according to the simple recipe given by ivezic et al ( 1997 ) , while the silicate opacity is that of draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "we ignore scattering .",
    "[ fig - computed - disk - structure ] shows the structure of the disk for these stellar parameters . the inner edge , beyond which the vertical height of the inner edge quickly declines ( although when plotted linearly in @xmath6 this decline is not so rapid as it seems in this figure ) .",
    "the disk has the usual flaring shape , but with self - irradiation effects added .",
    "the region is the shadowed region .",

    "is still not in sight of the star itself , but it receives flux from the inner rim , which is sufficiently strong to keep up the disk .",
    "inwards radiative diffusion prevents a sudden jump to the fully flared region , although the surface temperatures can not be prevented from jumping .",
    "the inward radiative diffusion is estimated using an equation similar to eq .  , but .",
    "the details of the structure are not very important , since this region hardly contributes to the sed . for this reason we are content with the rather crude description presented here .",
    "[ fig - stmodel - sed - all ] shows the resulting sed for the example model .",
    "we show for reference in panel ( a ) the sed predicted by a cg97 model , where the effects of the inner radius ( emission and shadow ) is ignored .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the effect of including the emission from the inner rim , assumed to have the height of disk at that radius . in this case , the sed in the mid to far infrared remains unmodified , but a new component appears in the near - infrared .",
    "finally , panel ( c ) shows the results of the self - consistent calculation described in the previous sections .",
    "one can see that the nir emission from the puffed - up rim increases , but the inner rim starts to cast a shadow over the disk , thereby suppressing some of the mid- and far infrared emission .",
    "panel ( d ) shows a blow - up of the 1100 @xmath2mregion , where the different effects of the inner rim can be clearly seen .      in fig .",
    "[ fig - stmodel - sed - incl ] we show how the sed of our example model changes with the inclination with respect to the line of sight ( panel a ) .",
    "we consider here only values of @xmath62 such that the line of sight does not intercept the outer disk .",
    "one sees that for nearly face - on inclinations the nir excess is less prominent and the far infrared is strong , while for nearly edge - on inclinations the opposite is true . by varying @xmath62 from @xmath79 to @xmath80 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath81  decreases from 0.18 to 0.08 , while the infrared excess at wavelengths longer than 7 @xmath2 m  increases from 0.32 to 0.35 .",
    "this is because the disk radiates predominantly towards the poles , while the inner rim radiates predominantly towards the equator .",
    "the emission features are optically thin features and are therefore less affected by the inclination . only when the inclination would exceed the opening angle of the flared disk , these features would go from emission into absorption because of the obscuration effect of the disk itself .",
    "however , in order to model this properly we would need a multidimensional ray - tracing computation , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "[ fig - stmodel - sed - incl ] [ fig - stmodel - rin ] [ fig - ten - mic - feature ] [ fig - stmodel - sigmaslope ]      the inner rim in our models is located at the dust evaporation radius , and is therefore fixed once the stellar parameters are defined . nevertheless , it is instructive to see the effects of varying inner radius on the sed , because it helps in clarifying the properties of our models , and we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - stmodel - rin ] the sed of our standard model for varying @xmath31 ( panel b ) .      if the height of the puffed - up inner rim is computed according to the equation for vertical pressure balance ( eq .   with @xmath59 replace by @xmath65 ) , then the shadow that the rim projects over the disk will usually extend up to a radius of roughly @xmath82 to @xmath83 times the inner radius .",
    "this ratio turns out to be fairly robust in our model , which can be attributed to the fact that the ratio of @xmath84 is fairly constant for all model parameters . at @xmath82 to @xmath83 times @xmath31 the surface layer temperature is about @xmath85 to @xmath86 times lower than @xmath65 ( which is @xmath87 by definition in our model ) .",
    "this means that the shadow starts to affect the regions of the disk s surface layer that emit the 10 micron feature , which lies at @xmath88 times longer wavelengths than the nir bump .",
    "this effect is already visible when comparing our standard model to the result of a cg97 model ( fig .  [ fig - stmodel - sed - all]c and d ) .",
    "if , for some reason , we have underestimated the height of the inner rim ( which is the most difficult quantity to determine in our models ) , this might have repercussions on the predicted 10 micron flux . to investigate this effect ,",
    "we have artificially enhanced the height of the puffed - up inner rim ( i.e.  we have relaxed the assumption that the disk is here in vertical pressure balance ) , and computed the sed .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ten - mic - feature]c , where we have increased @xmath89 to values as large as 8 . for increasing inner rim height ,",
    "the 2 micron bump is of course enhanced , but the major effect on the sed is the change at longer wavelengths , due to the fact that the shadow extends to larger radii , eventually to most of the disk .",
    "the 10 micron feature is the first part of the sed to be affected by the increase of @xmath89 , and has entirely disappeared for @xmath89=8 .",
    "the 20 micron silicate feature is less affected , because it is emitted at lower temperature , and hence at larger radius .",
    "the total ir flux is conserved : the increase in nir flux goes at the cost of the mid - ir and far - ir flux ( see table 1 , models h1 .. h4 ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath89 depends on a number of properties that are difficult to constrain , such as the shape of the disk behind the rim and the dust properties . however , its exact value is not crucial for the discussion of the basic idea behind our model , which revolves around two issues : the presence of a puffed - up inner rim at roughly the dust evaporation radius , naturally producing the nir bump , and a proper consideration of energy conservation , which implies that we must take into account the shadow the rim projects onto the disk .",
    "the exact shape of the rim is , in a way , a secondary aspect .",
    "the behaviour of the near - infrared excess as function of the stellar type of the central star is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - zams - seds ] , which plots the seds of four stars along the zero - age - main - sequence ranging from spectral type b2 to m2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the nir bump is clearly visible in stars of spectral type a and earlier , but tends to disappear in later stars .",
    "this is due to two effects .",
    "first of all , for cooler central stars the stellar flux peaks at longer wavelength , and therefore swamps the near - infrared emission of the disk .",
    "in addition to this , the ratio of the covering factor of the puffed - up inner rim ( in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ) to the covering fraction of the flaring part of the disk decreases for later spectral types .",
    "these factors determine the relative importance of the various components of the sed , as can be seen from table 1 . as we consider stars of later spectral types , the near - infrared excess luminosity decreases by a factor of two .",
    "the various component that contribute to the observed sed of a typical tts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tt - shadow ] .",
    "our disk models provide a natural explanation for the fact that the near - infrared `` bump '' is observed in herbig aebe stars , while it is not noticeable in stars of later spectral type , and in particular in tts .",
    "we will come back to this point in the following section .",
    "disk models where the irradiation from the star dominates the heating provide a good fit to most properties of pre - main - sequence stars over a large range of masses however , there are few points that have remained unclear , and we think that the better treatment of the inner disk with respect to previous models provides an answer to one of them , namely the long - standing puzzle of the near - ir bump in the seds of haebe stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab - aur ] we show a fit of our model to the sed of ab  aurigae , one of the best studied hae stars .",
    "the basic features of the sed are well reproduced by the model : the 3@xmath2 m  bump , the 10 micron feature , the far ir plateau and the sharp decline towards mm wavelengths .",
    "our model has only a few free parameters ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the dust opacity table ) , so the fact that the data can be fit in a reasonable way gives support to our model .",
    "the inclination angle of @xmath93 needed for this fit is larger than what most observations suggest ( e.g.  natta et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the assumption of a perfectly vertical rim which is responsible for this value may be too simple . a more rounded surface of the inner rim will allow more of the rim radiation to be emitted into polar directions .    nevertheless , the model - predicted values of @xmath81  for a stars ( hovering around 0.17 ) agree well with those observed in four hae stars by natta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which range between 0.12 and 0.25 , respectively , and by meeus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in a sample of 14 hae stars , where @xmath81  varies between 0.06 and 0.3 for the group i sources .",
    "observations show that the `` bump '' is a more or less constant feature from star to star ( hillenbrand et al . 1992 ) , in contrast to the long - wavelength emission , which is affected by a variety of disk and dust parameters ( meeus et al .",
    "this robustness is naturally reproduced in our model , since to first order the properties of the nir bump are determined only by the dust sublimation temperature and the covering fraction of the rim , the latter varying only weakly as a function of stellar type .    in spite of this ,",
    "the `` bump '' disappears in stars of spectral type f or lower ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - zams - seds ] ) .",
    "as discussed in  4.6 and shown in table 1 , this can be explained as being due to two concurring effects .",
    "the first is the lower covering angle of the rim in stars of later spectral type , where dust sublimation occurs closer to the star .",
    "the second is the fact that the stellar radiation peaks at longer wavelengths , swamping the rim emission .",
    "thus , even if the shape of the `` bump '' is the same , it becomes very difficult to see it and to separate the rim contribution from the stellar emission .",
    "it is , however , possible that one is seeing the rim emission in some tts with near - infrared colors that can only be understood if the disk has an inner radius of few stellar radii , coinciding with the dust sublimation radius for systems of typical tts luminosity ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; kenyon et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "another interesting aspect of these models is the effect of the shadow that the rim projects onto the disk .",
    "the 10 @xmath2 m  silicate emission in our example model has @xmath94=3.5 , in reasonable agreement with what observed in hae stars by natta et al .",
    "these numbers , however , are very dependent on the properties of the grains in the disk surface layer .",
    "a weak or absent 10 @xmath2mfeature , for example , can be attributed to a dominance of large silicate grains in the disk surface layer ( meeus et al .",
    "2001 ) , to a very high ratio of the visual opacity to the opacity in the feature ( natta et al .",
    "2001 ) , or to an almost perfect cancellation of absorption and emission in disks seen edge - on ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) .",
    "we propose here still another possibility , namely that the inner rim in some object is higher than normal , because , for example , the rim is not in hydrostatic equilibrium , is thicker in the radial direction , or has a higher @xmath89 , the ratio of the photospheric to the pressure scale height . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - stmodel - effect - all]c and table 1 , a factor 1.7 increase of @xmath89 would be sufficient to suppress the silicate feature entirely .",
    "one point we want to stress here is that a rim structure such as we have described can only exist if the gaseous disk is optically thin to the stellar radiation _ and _ the dusty disk is optically thick .",
    "if an optically thick gaseous disk extends toward the star closer than the dust evaporation radius , then there is no puffed - up rim and the standard models , which describe the emission of an optically thick disk surface , apply .",
    "the formation of a puffed - up rim seems possible only if the accretion rate through the disk is very low , as briefly discussed by natta et al .",
    "there are indications that this is indeed the case in the majority of hae stars .",
    "tambovtseva et al . (",
    "2001 ) find accretion rates below @xmath95 m@xmath96 yr@xmath97 from their study of balmer emission lines in ux ori ( see also ghandour et al .",

    "<S> a model for irradiated dust disks around herbig ae stars is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on the flaring disk model of chiang & goldreich ( 1997 , henceforth cg97 ) , but with the central regions of the disk removed . </S>",
    "<S> the inner rim of the disk is puffed up and is much hotter than the rest of the disk , because it is directly exposed to the stellar flux . </S>",
    "<S> if located at the dust evaporation radius , its reemitted flux produces a conspicuous bump in the sed which peaks at 23 micron . we propose that this emission is the explanation for the near - infrared bump observed in the seds of herbig ae stars . </S>",
    "<S> we study for which stellar parameters this bump would be observable , and find that it is the case for herbig ae stellar parameters but not for t - tauri stars , confirming what is found from the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effects of the shadow cast by the inner rim over the rest of the flaring disk . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowed region can be quite large , and under some circumstances the entire disk may lie in the shadow . </S>",
    "<S> this shadowed region will be much cooler than disk , since its only heating sources are radial radiative diffusion and possible indirect sources of irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> under certain special circumstances the shadowing effect can suppress , or even completely eliminate , the 10 micron emission feature from the spectrum , which might explain the anomalous seds of some isolated herbig ae stars in the sample of meeus et al .  </S>",

    "<S> the emission from the inner rim contributes significantly to the irradiation of this flaring disk . </S>",
