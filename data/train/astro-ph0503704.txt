    "the luminosity function ( lf ) , i.e. the number of galaxies per unit luminosity and volume is one of the fundamental quantities of observational cosmology : it is interesting in its own , and it is a necessary ingredient ( weight ) in most cosmological measures dealing with galaxies . the history of the lf determination dates back to zwicky ( 1957 ) at least .",
    "this debate with hubble ( zwicky 1951 , hubble 1936 ) around the shape of the lf is one of the pillar of the history of the lf determination .    with the advent of large surveys , such as 2df ( folkes et al .",
    "1999 ) , sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) and of the virtual observatory , samples grow by orders of magnitude , and it is nowadays common to deal with more than one thousand galaxies when computing the lf . however , at the extremes of absolute magnitude ranges or in special environments or for certain galaxy types , the number of galaxies is often low .",
    "methods used for the lf computation also improved along the years ( see citations in sec 3 ) .    in andreon ( 2004 )",
    "we showed how much the neglected observer prior influences the found result ( error and confidence interval , an example along the same line is presented in blanton et al .",
    "this paper has a twofold aim : improve the method in the lf determination and apply it to the best data ( useful for the lf determination ) ever taken in @xmath2-band .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the data and the data reduction are presented . in section  3 , new statistical method is presented . in section  4",

    "ac114 and ac118 are among the most observed clusters at intermediate redshift . discovered by couch & newell ( 1984 ) and later by abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 ) ,",

    "ac114 is a regular massive cluster , whereas ac118 is a massive merging system .",

    "the pixel size is 0.292 arcsec and the field of view @xmath8 arcmin .",
    "the field was observed in the near  infrared @xmath1 passband ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) during four photometric nights with good seeing ( @xmath11 arcsec ) . the total useful exposure time is 18840 s , resulting from the coaddition of many short jittered exposures .",
    "photometric calibration has been obtained by observing a few standard stars , interspersed with ac114 observations , taken from the list of infrared nicmos standard stars published in persson et al .",

    "this image has a seeing of 0.8 arcsec .",

    "all images have been reduced as in paper i. shortly , they are flat  fielded by flaton  flatoff . in order to test the accuracy of the flat  fielding , a standard star has been observed in 8 chip locations .",
    "the root mean square variation of his magnitude is 0.008 mag .",
    "since the rms deviation is small , our images do not require a supplementary illumination correction .",

    "in the first three lines , there are more decimals than precision allows , to avoid truncation errors . the last three lines quote values including all ( 0.5 mag wide ) bins or , in parenthesis , excluding bins with less than 10 galaxies .",

    "figure 3 ( for ac114 ) and 4 ( for ac118 ) show the galaxy counts in the control field direction ( lower points in the lower panel ) and in the cluster line of sight ( upper points in the lower panel ) , and a joint fit to cluster and control field counts . for display purposes only , we show points and error bars computed with usual recipes , although we make no use of them in our analysis ( parameter or errors determination ) .",
    "the fit is performed on the unbinned distributions , whereas we bin them for display purpose only . according to astronomical standard practice , error bars in lower panels have a width given by @xmath19 .",
    "the points in the upper panels of figures 3 and 4 mark the algebraic difference between the galaxy counts in the cluster direction and the best fitting background counts . when the difference is negative ( at @xmath20 mag , plus few points at fainter mag ) the result can not be plotted , because the scale requires a positive argument for the logarithm .",
    "error bars on upper panels of figures 3 and 4 mark the square root of the variances of the minuend and subtrahend .",
    "the schechter curve is instead the rigorous derivation of the cluster lf , drawn with the best fit parameters found on the ( cluster+field , field ) datasets .",
    "it is not a best fit to the @xmath21 difference , as detailed in section 3.2.2 and it is positively defined at every magnitude , at the variance of the above mentioned  data \" points .",

    "these lfs determinations function are among the deepest at the studied ( large ) area ever measured ( see fig 10 in paper i ) , to our best knowledge .",
    "we hope that our lf method makes them also the most rigorously determined .",
    "a question naturally arises .",
    "are our improvement formally correct but of null importance ?",
    "after all , the best fit model passes through the cluster contribution , even if approximatively computed .",
    "so why one should bother himself with all these apparently useless complications ?",
    "our method do nt produce puzzling results , and it is the appropriate choice when puzzling results are found , for example when are observed :    - negative star formation rates , that , according to the authors  lack physical sense \" ( rojas et al .",
    "2004 ) ;    - negative flux densities ( for some scuba sources , smith et al .",
    "2001 , their table 1 ) ;    - clusters with negative blue fraction ( butcher & oemer 1984 , their fig 3 ) ;    - clusters with negative masses ( at least in some magnitude / radial bin , see e.g. hansen et al .",
    "2005 , their figure 5 , top - left panel ) .",
    "most of these ( and other ) puzzling results originates from not fully accounting for the impact of a background and of its fluctuations in computing the quantity of interest .",
    "either the analysis is rigorous , and we are sure that the result makes sense , or the correctness of the results can not be guaranteed .",
    "figure 5 shows 68 % and 95 % confidence contours on @xmath24 and @xmath15 . with respect to confidence contours of ac118 computed in paper i , here",
    "confidence contours shrank by a factor two because of the better determination of the background counts , and moved by one ( old ) sigma , because the new background counts do not longer show a minor excess , with respect to a power law , at intermediate magnitudes .",
    "inspection of figure 5 shows that two lfs are approximatively compatible at the 95 % confidence level .",
    "ac114 is , if any , steeper and brighter than ac118 , as comparison of fig 2 and 3 also shows .",
    "such a difference is expected , given the dependence of the best fit lf parameters on the environment , put forward in paper i and andreon ( 2002 ) , and the observed difference in the density distribution of the two clusters ( compare fig 1 with fig 1 in paper i ) .",
    "although the inspection of the relative location of ( @xmath25 ) values and contours is the standard astronomical way of comparing ( @xmath25 ) values for different samples , a rigorous comparison of the two lfs , however , should follow another path : first of all , figure 5 shows that there are ( @xmath26 ) values within both 95 % confidence contours , but do nt tell if these values are achieved for the same values of the parameters not plotted in figure . for our lfs , the nuisance parameters are the background ( @xmath27 ) parameters . for field",
    "lfs the nuisance parameter @xmath17 is `` hidden '' and the 95 % confidence contours of the two compared lf may overlap , but for incompatible @xmath17 values .",
    "second , the simple comparison of figure 5 may incorrectly leave the impression of compatible lfs when instead the two lfs are actually different .",
    "consider , for example , the case of two lfs very different , but computed for a background known within a large uncertainty ( leading to large confidence contours ) : the derived contours overlap each other , while a correct comparison of the data ( see below ) will show the two lfs to be different .",
    "finally , and even in absence of a background ( or any nuisance parameter ) , what actually the figure shows is that there is a region of _ observed _ values of the @xmath25 plane ( the region where confidence contours cross ) that can be drawn from two different true values of @xmath28 at a given confidence , and _ not _ that a single pair of @xmath25 may generate two _ observed _ @xmath25 at that confidence : confidence contours give the probability of the data given the hypothesis and not vice versa . by the way ,",
    "the contours for the two clusters are computed for different hypothesis and both can not be true at the same time ( the two pairs of best fit parameters are numerically different ) .    in order to establish if the two lfs differ , we can ask ourself if a fit of both clusters with a single set of @xmath29 values is much worser that a fit with individual @xmath29 values for each cluster .",
    "the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) allow such a comparison , and without any need to bin the data .",
    "our models to be compared are hierarchically nested and regularity conditions needed to use the lrt hold in our case ( but see protassov et al .",
    "2002 for a case where regularity conditions do not ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio is computed by taking the ratio of the maximum value of the likelihood function under the constraint of the null hypothesis ( = one set of @xmath29 values ) to the maximum with that constraint relaxed ( = two sets of @xmath29 values ) . if the null hypothesis is true , then @xmath30 ( = twice the above ratio expressed in logarithm units ) will be asymptotically @xmath23-distributed with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of the two considered models .    therefore , we modify eq .",
    "3 adding one more schecther function , and we fit at once all data , once keeping one single set of @xmath31 values for both clusters , and once leaving free @xmath31 for each cluster independently . in each fit",
    ", both clusters share the same set of parameters describing the background , at variance of the fits discussed earlier in this section , when we didnt constraint the parameters of the background to be the same in the ac114 and ac118 fits .",
    "we measure @xmath32 for two ( more ) degrees of freedom . therefore , under the null hypothesis ( the two lf having the same @xmath31 parameters ) , there is about 5 % probability to observe a larger likelihood ratio , confirming the cursory inspection of ac114 and ac118 confidence contours previously mentioned .",
    "such a probability is not small enough to reject the null hypothesis that the two lf have the same @xmath31 parameters at high confidence , and we can therefore co  add the data of the two clusters and compute the composite lf , which is , actually , the likelihood under the null hypothesis just computed .",
    "the above path naturally solve to the difficult procedure of average the lfs of the two clusters ( or , more generally two data sets ) , rigorously accounting for the error on the relative normalization of the two lfs , often not even mentioned in astronomical papers .",
    "best fit values for the combined data set ( = ac114+ac118 ) are listed in table 2 and @xmath31 confidence contours are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the fit is good , in the sense that the probability of finding a worser @xmath23 is large ( table 2 ) .",
    "although the use of a rigorous ( and time consuming ) test leads to the same conclusion of a cursory inspection of ac114 and ac118 confidence contours , the former guarantees a correctness that the latter does not , and therefore should be preferred .",
    "we presented a rigorous method to measure the luminosity function in presence of background , extending previous methods to deal with a more complicate case , and including neglected terms .",
    "the approach does not suffer from logical inconsistences ( or limitations ) present in previous approaches and put on a sure foot claims of providing errors with the correct coverage ( i.e. that our errors are 68 % confidence intervals ) .",
    "we applied the method to measure the lf of two clusters of galaxies , using among the deepest and widest observations in @xmath1 band ever done , producing one of the best determinations of the lf in this band ( and we hope one of the more rigorous ones , too ) . in passing we show the bias of a flip  flopping definition of magnitude , and we remind that several type of magnitudes are flip  flopping .",
    "several of our comments are clearly not specific to cluster lfs and holds for the _ field _ lf too .",
    "distribution functions in presence of background ( such as the cluster lf in absence of a redshift survey , but also the h alpha equivalent width distribution in presence of a continuum ) should     be fitted without removing the background contribution , adding instead a background term to the model ,     be simultaneously fitted with the background distribution ,     use unbinned data ,     adopt the likelihood ( not the conditional likelihood ) ,     allow poisson fluctuations of the whole sample ( i.e. include the @xmath33 term , as prescribed by the extended likelihood approach ) ,     avoid the use of @xmath34 in place of the 68 % confidence interval     do not compute the 68 % confidence interval by summing in quadrature the 68 % confidence intervals of the addenda .",
    "two sources of errors are negligible in our work , and therefore neglected .",
    "first , the error on the value of the input quantities , that in our case are magnitudes , but in other papers are magnitudes and densities . with the operated choices , magnitudes",
    "have negligible errors , and for this reason we have neglected their impact on the lf parameters .",
    "if this condition does not arise , one need to convolve the fitting function by the error function , in the way described by jeffreys ( 1938 ) .",
    "densities , instead , usually have large errors , as large as 100 % ( for example in some 2df sub - samples , from quantities quoted in croton et al .",
    "2005 ) , simply because densities are computed by counting a small number of galaxies ( e.g. as few as 1 ) .",
    "@xmath35 , a measure of density derived from the distance of the 5@xmath36 neighbour , used in some recent density estimates , has a @xmath37 % error .",
    "the presence of large errors on the input quantity further complicates a rigorous determination of the lf and of his dependence on environment .",
    "such a rigorous determination has not yet been published , to our best knowledge .",
    "second , we studied the whole galaxy population , and not a minority population . in the latter case , errors in the galaxy classification , even if coming infrequently , pollute the minority population with objects coming from the main sample .",
    "let us consider an example : the lf of a population representing a tiny fraction , say 0.0003 , as the fraction of local e+a galaxies .",
    "if classification errors concern a fraction of 0.0003 of the whole galaxy population ( a very small fraction , indeed ) , any e+a sample studied is 50 % contaminated by objects unrelated to the class aimed to study , and one should not be surprised to  discover \" that the selected sample has a lf similar to the one of the whole sample , being 50 % contaminated . such contamination should be accounted for in the lf computation , but it is usually not .",
    "our approach of not subtracting the background from the data , but of to add a background term to the model , accounts for the uncertainty due to the mentioned contamination population .",
