    "the distribution of brightness over the solar photosphere is not uniform , due to the presence of dark sunspots and bright faculae in active regions and to the granular convection and bright network elements , associated with slender flux tubes located in the intergranular lanes .",
    "the baricentre of the brightness distribution over the solar disk , i.e. , the photocentre of the sun , is affected by the brightness inhomogeneities having the largest scales , that is by sunspots and faculae , because the averaged effect of the granulation and the network elements is negligible , thanks to their almost uniform distribution on spatial scales comparable with the solar radius .",
    "the rotation of the sun and the evolution of the active regions make the perturbation of the position of the photocentre a function of the time .",
    "sunspots and faculae are manifestations of the magnetic field , amplified and modulated by the solar dynamo , and are present also on the photospheres of late - type stars hosting hydromagnetic dynamos in their convective envelopes . therefore , the brightness inhomogeneities observed in the sun are also present on late - type stars during their main - sequence lifetime and are most prominent in young , rapidly rotating stars , given their more powerful dynamo action ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    the perturbation of the position of the photocentre of late - type stars due to their magnetic activity should be considered in some detail , in view of the forthcoming space missions gaia and sim .",

    "moreover , ground - based interferometric instruments , such as prima at vlti , will also reach an accuracy of @xmath4 @xmath3as in the determination of the photocentre position .",
    "the feasibility of such a ground - based high - precision differential astrometry has been recently demonstrated by the phases ( palomar high - precision astrometric search for planets ) program ( see * ? ? ?",
    ".    in the present paper , a simple model for computing the astrometric effects of cool spots and bright solar - like faculae in a late - type star is introduced , and applied to derive the maximum expected amplitude of variation of the photocentre position as a function of the active region filling factor .",
    "since the perturbation is cyclically modulated by the stellar rotation , it can be a source of spurious detections of close - by planetary companions by means of the astrometric technique .",
    "we present some cases leading to possible confusion and propose methods to discriminate the effects of a planet from those due to stellar activity .",
    "let us consider a cartesian reference frame with the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane in the plane of the sky , that is the origin o at the unperturbed photocentre of the star , the @xmath5-axis along the declination direction pointing to the north pole , the @xmath6-axis along the direction of the increasing right ascension and the @xmath7-axis pointing toward the observer .",
    "the position @xmath8 of the photocentre at a given time @xmath9 depends on the distribution of the brightness on the surface of the apparent disk of the star at the isophotal wavelength @xmath10 of the observations , and is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the specific intensity at wavelength @xmath10 at the given position @xmath13 on the stellar disk , and the integration is extended over the apparent stellar disk @xmath14 .",

    "we have applied the model described in sect .  [ model ] to compute the apparent motion of the photocentre of a star with a single active region on its surface , containing only cool spots and having a longitudinal extension of @xmath56 between latitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the northern hemisphere .",

    "[ flux_var ] .    when the inclination is lower than @xmath56 , the active region is always in view and produces a continuous modulation of the position of the photocentre and of the flux that depends on the variation of its position on the stellar disk and its projected area . for a pole - on view ,",
    "the projected area is constant and the variation of the photocentre abscissa is purely sinusoidal , whereas the flux stays constant . when the inclination increases , the modulation of the photocentre abscissa is no longer sinusoidal .",
    "when @xmath65 , there are intervals of phase during which the photocentre is unperturbed , i.e. , when the active region transits on the invisible hemisphere of the star .",
    "considering the case with @xmath66 , we note that , when the active region first appears on the rising part of the disk , it produces a negative shift of the photocentre abscissa because the baricentre of the flux distribution falls in the opposite half of the disk",
    ". then the shift reverses its sign , when the active region is carried by stellar rotation on the other half of the disk , and eventually it becomes zero when the active region comes out of view . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the duration of the active region transit across the disk depends on its average latitude and the inclination .",
    "moreover , the sign and the value of the photocentre excursion depend also on the position angle of the projection of the stellar rotation axis on the plane of the sky , as measured by the angle @xmath22 .",
    "the combination of these different factors explains the different shapes and amplitudes of the curves plotted in fig .",
    "[ phot_ex ] .",
    "the flux variation produced by the active region increases with increasing inclination and reaches its maximum value when the active region transits through the centre of the stellar disk , i.e. , for @xmath66 , because in that case its projected area reaches its maximum value .",

    "[ correl ] .    when only a single active region is present on the stellar disk , the excursion of the photocentre reaches its maximum value for a given value of the total active region area . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if the same total area is subdivided into two or more active regions , the excursion generally decreases because the simultaneous presence of more than one brightness inhomogeneity leads to a reduction of their combined effects .",
    "therefore , we have investigated the variation of the maximum photocentre excursion @xmath69 as a function of the filling factor @xmath70 for a single active region by means of our model ( see fig .  [ excur_l ] ) .",

    "we consider also the effect of a facular component that surrounds the dark spot .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the spot constrast is assumed to be @xmath72 , while the facular contrast is @xmath73 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the effect of the faculae is small , in spite of their relative area being ten times that of cool spots .",
    "this is due to the fact that their effect is significant only close to the limb , because their contrast is negligible close to the centre of the disk .",
    "moreover , the projection effect disfavours the facular contribution , because their projected area becomes small close to the limb .",
    "the situation changes if we consider hot spots instead of solar - like faculae , that is bright regions the constrast of which is significant also close to the disk centre , as is sometimes observed in the case of very active stars ( cf . ,",

    "the correlations shown in figs .  [ excur_l ] and [ flux_l ] can be well approximated by power laws up to a value of the filling factor @xmath74 , beyond which they deviate from such a simple dependence because the amplitude of the variation saturates when a large fraction of the stellar disk is covered with active regions . applying a linear best fit to the plots in figs .",

    "@xcite also estimated upper limits for the astrometric effect of dark spots assuming a simplified model with a fixed projected spot geometry and neglecting limb - darkening effects .",
    "their model confirms the almost linear correlation between the variation of the stellar flux and the photocentre excursion that can be deduced combining together eqs .",
    "( [ power_law ] ) and ( [ flux_law ] ) .",
    "however , they predict an astrometric effect about 60% larger than ours for a given photometric amplitude , essentially because of the neglection of the foreshortening and limb - darkening effects .",
    "note that the simultaneous presence of spots and faculae decreases the photocentre excursion in our model and makes the regression more steep , especially for @xmath79 .",
    "this is due to the opposite effects of bright and dark regions spatially associated on the stellar disk . for a filling factor larger than 0.03",
    ", the effect of the faculae becomes negligible because of their low contrast close to the centre of the disk that leads to a saturation of their contribution .",
    "equations ( [ power_law ] ) and ( [ flux_law ] ) can be used to estimate the maximum relative photocentre excursion and flux variation , respectively , expected for a given spot coverage in a solar - like star .",
    "this is useful to evaluate the possibility that stellar activity may account for an observed shift of the photocentre in a late - type star .",
    "the effects of stellar magnetic activity on the position of the photocentre can be principally observed in nearby solar - like stars , because the maximum excursion can not exceed the apparent stellar radius . considering the one hundred nearest stars listed in the catalogue of @xcite ,",

[ cols=\">,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results obtained in sect .  [ results ] show that for a filling factor of 0.2% , corresponding to the sun at the maximum of the eleven - year cycle , excursions as large as @xmath86 @xmath3as can be expected for @xmath87 cen a in the case of an active region consisting only of cool spots . in the case of an active region containing also solar - like faculae , those values are reduced by a factor of @xmath88 because the faculae tend to decrease the effect of the spots at such a low value of the filling factor .",
    "a solar value of the filling factor is likely to be appropriate for @xmath87 cen a because the star appears to have a level of activity comparable or slightly lower than the sun , with a rotation period of about 29 days ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the above estimates refer to the case of a single active region , thus the excursion can be reduced if a few active regions are simultaneously present on the stellar disk . in any case",
    ", those amplitudes will be easily detectable by astrometric space - borne experiments like gaia and sim , and could be within the reach of ground - based interferometers , such as prima .",
    "note that a periodic signal can be detected with high confidence in a sufficiently long time series , even if the errors on the single measurements are larger than its amplitude ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the sun ,",
    "the average lifetime of the sunspot groups dominating the flux modulation is @xmath89 days ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they have a remarkable tendency to form in sequence within activity complexes , the lifetime of which is @xmath90 months ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    therefore , if an activity complex on @xmath87 cen a is stable for a time interval longer than the rotation period , it can produce a cyclic modulation of the position of the photocentre with a semi - amplitude up to @xmath86 @xmath3as and a period of 29 days that can be erroneously attributed to the reflex motion induced by a planet of @xmath91 earth masses on an orbit of semi - major axis of @xmath92 au , assuming that the star has the same mass of the sun .",
    "such a spurious detection is difficult to disprove by correlating the photocentre motion with the variation of the stellar optical flux , as measured by ground - based photometry , because the expected amplitude of variation is only @xmath93 mag ( cf .",
    "[ flux_l ] and eq .",
    "[ flux_law ] ) .    on the average",
    ", the level of activity is expected to be higher than solar for the stars of spectral types later than the sun listed in table  [ table1 ] , because their convection zones are deeper and their rotation periods are comparable or shorter than the solar one ( cf . , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the expectation is confirmed in the case of @xmath94 eri , for which spot modelling of most photometry indicates a filling factor of at least 0.7% @xcite .",
    "this implies a maximum excursion of @xmath95 @xmath3as for the photocentre position with the rotation period of the star , i.e. , @xmath96 days .",
    "moreover , the observations indicate that the signal would maintain its coherence for several rotations because the timescale of spot evolution is longer than 35 days .",
    "the observed amplitude of the optical flux variation of @xmath94 eri is only @xmath97 mag , that is at the detection limit of ground - based photometry .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath94 eri has a planetary companion on a wide orbit with a period of 6.8 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the astrometric orbit has a semi - major axis of @xmath98 mas ( milli arcseconds ) , that is much larger than the astrometric noise expected to be produced by stellar activity .",
    "the inclination of the planetary orbit is @xmath99 . assuming that the stellar spin and the orbital angular momentum are aligned",
    ", we can adopt the same inclination for the stellar rotation axis .",
    "this implies that all the active regions located at latitudes higher than @xmath71 are circumpolar and produce a continuous modulation of the photocentre position with the stellar rotation period",
    ". they can give rise to a spurious detection of further planetary companions around @xmath94  eri .",
    "specifically , assuming a stellar mass of @xmath100 m@xmath101 , a photocentre oscillation with a period of @xmath102 days and an amplitude of @xmath103 @xmath3as can be attributed to a planet of @xmath104 jupiter masses on an orbit of semi - major axis @xmath105 au .",
    "late - type stars with rotation periods of a few days have spot filling factors of the order of @xmath106 ( cf . , e. g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the cyclic modulation of the signal with the rotation period is much shorter than the typical timescales of starspot evolution , that range typically between @xmath113 and @xmath114 months @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the astrometric modulation is quasi - stable , increasing the probability of spurious planetary detections .",
    "of course , the correlation of the astrometric signal with the photometric variation can be used to discriminate between activity - induced and planetary - induced photocentre motions .",
    "such stars would have relative flux variations of the order of 0.1 mag , that is about @xmath115 times larger than the photometric precision of gaia .",
    "however , the unknown value of the inclination of the stellar rotation axis leaves an ambiguity in those cases in which no flux variation can be detected .",
    "we have pointed out the importance of taking into account the astrometric effects of surface brightness inhomogeneities in future astrometric search for extrasolar planets , in particular of planets with an orbital period of a few days or a few tens of days around late - type stars .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of stellar wide - band fluxes offers a powerful tool to discriminate activity - induced effects from the reflex motion of the photocentre induced by an orbiting body .",
    "however , the cases of nearby stars , such as @xmath87 cen or @xmath94 eri , or of rotators observed almost pole - on require some additional methods to investigate the possible effects of magnetic activity . the fraction of stars having an inclination lower than , say , @xmath56 is 6.0% , which implies that at least a few tens of ambiguous cases should be expected in the gaia sample of stars within 60 pc .",
    "a further method of discrimination in those cases comes from the fact that the activity - induced motion has the same period of the rotation of the star .",
    "if the inclination is not too low , it can be measured from the modulation of the chromospheric ca ii h & k or ca infrared triplet fluxes , even for stars with an activity level as low as the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or can be roughly estimated from the spectroscopic @xmath116 and an assumed stellar radius .",
    "conversely , when the star is viewed almost pole - on , no rotational modulation is expected , but the level of activity can be estimated from those chromospheric indicators      these considerations indicate the importance of a characterization of the level of activity and the determination of the rotation period for those stars that have been selected as potentially planet - harbouring objects by means of the astrometric method .",
    "this is particularly important when the measurement samples consist of widely separated data , as will be the case for gaia that will observe a given star for about 80 times in five years , on the average .",
    "dedicated simulations , based on the observed positions of solar active regions along an entire activity cycle and the time - sampling law of gaia , are required to assess the impact of stellar activity on gaia long - term astrometry for solar - like stars .",
    "this will be the subject of a future work . here",
    "we limit ourselves to some general considerations based on solar analogy .",
    "individual spot groups will grow and decay on timescales of a few weeks , nevertheless the astrometric signal due to photospheric activity may show some phase coherence for timescales comparable with the lifetimes of complexes of activity . in the case of sunspot complexes , those timescales do not exceed @xmath117 solar rotations @xcite . however , @xcite reported the persistence of two chromospheric active regions separated by @xmath118 in longitude for time intervals longer than @xmath119 days during periods of moderate or high solar activity .",
    "if a similar behaviour characterizes magnetic activity in other solar - like stars , this can give rise to spurious planetary detections given that the astrometric signal produced by two active regions separated by @xmath118 in longitude shows a sinusoidal oscillation with a period half that of stellar rotation .",
    "stars with a level of activity significantly higher than our sun often show active longitudes of spot activity lasting for decades ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can give rise to spurious astrometric detections of bodies orbiting around them .",
    "modelling of the wide - band fluxes of highly active stars indicates that cool spots usually dominate their photometric variations .",
    "moreover , extrapolations based on solar observations at different levels of activity along the 11-yr cycle , support the conclusion that their active regions are dominated by cool spots with bright faculae playing a secondary role @xcite .",
    "this implies that their activity - induced astrometric signal can be estimated from the first of equations ( [ power_law ] ) ( or the corresponding plot in fig .",
