    "in this section , we briefly describe some examples that highlight the importance of mpss for high - power target protection .    in may 2013 , a gold target ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jparc_accident ] ) melted in the hadron experimental facility at j - parc and radioactive material was released from the building @xcite .",
    "the root cause was traced to a quadrupole magnet power supply in the main ring , which caused the beam to be spilled in 5  ms instead of the nominal 2  s. due to this accident all beam operations were terminated for about 8 months and beam operations to the hadron hall were stopped for more than one year .    in january 2010 , the neutron production target ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isis ] ) failed at the isis second target station @xcite .",
    "the root cause was traced to a combination of the high - density beam profile and a water leak .",
    "the water disassociated in the high - temperature environment and then the oxygen attacked the grain boundaries on the tantalum cladding .",
    "the cladding essentially fell apart , leaving a hole in the target . in 2004 the beam density on the psi neutron production target increased to 3.5 times the nominal value @xcite because the transport line ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vimos ] ) was accidentally set up for the case of the muon target being inserted , but actually the muon target was not inserted .",
    "the over - density condition was caught by a newly installed beam distribution monitor ( vimos ) before any serious damage could occur .",
    "we also need to be concerned with beam windows .",
    "they are often part of the target system , and can also be damaged by the beam .",
    "high - power beam windows must be cooled , usually with water .",
    "windows can fail due to over - focused or off - centre beams .",
    "radioactive water can be spilled into the beam line vacuum and/or the target environment . in 1996",
    "the beam window at the lampf linac beam dump failed @xcite , probably due to a combination of an unusually small beam size ( set up on purpose for an experiment ) and a weld joint where a thermocouple was attached to the air - side surface of the water - cooled window .",

    "* the energy per pulse = ( 2 mw)/(10 hz ) = 0.2 mj . *",
    "the energy density per pulse in target = ( 0.2 mj)/(2 cm)/(2 cm)/(0.75 m ) = 667 mj / m@xmath3 . * the peak power density = ( 667 mj / m@xmath3)/(1.5 @xmath2s ) = @xmath4 w / m@xmath3 .",
    "each beam pulse contains more than 100  j of energy , so even one off - centre pulse will exceed the 100  j limit in example  1 . with 1.5 @xmath2s beam pulses , it is not practical to shut off the beam mid - pulse .",
    "we can only prevent the next pulse from occurring , and there is a fair amount of time to do that  about 0.1  s.      consider a gaussian version of the pulsed beam in example 2 .",

    "we will consider only the beam - related protection . the targets themselves will have their own separate non - beam - related protection systems to monitor coolant flow , over temperature , etc .",
    "the main beam parameters of concern are density ( sometimes derived from a beam profile measurement ) , beam size , beam position , and beam current ( from which beam power can be calculated ) .",
    "beam - related target protection involves control over these parameters , monitoring these parameters , and turning off the beam if these parameters move outside allowable limits .",
    "types of beam - related target protection include :    * rapid and automatic beam turn off for off - normal beams ; * locking down equipment and operating control parameters to prevent accidental changes ; * alarms that alert operators when certain parameters move outside of pre - defined limits ; * collimators to partially intercept off - normal beams ; * beam transport designs that avoid high sensitivity  e.g . do not want to live on the edge , do not want to be very sensitive to small magnet changes ; * target designs that can tolerate off - normal beam for a short period of time ( e.g. most sns equipment is designed such that it can withstand two full - power off - normal beam pulses ) .",
    "some typical turn - off times for the sns case , scaledwidth=80.0% ]      the time it takes to automatically turn off the beam varies depending on the method used .",
    "figure  [ fig : time_to_trip ] shows some typical turn - off times for the sns case .",
    "the fastest method to turn off the beam is through the mps .",
    "after all , that is the purpose of the mps .",
    "a typical time to turn off the beam at sns is 20 to 30  @xmath2s for trips that originate in the linac , for example if a beam loss monitor exceeds a pre - determined threshold .",
    "trips that originate further downstream , in the ring or in the ring - to - target beam transport , can take a few @xmath2s longer .",
    "an interesting fine point is that if the trip occurs upstream of or within the accumulator ring , the mps can stop beam injection , but the beam that has already been injected into the ring will be sent to the target",
    ". the beam intensity can be anywhere from small to full intensity .",
    "if the trip occurs downstream of the ring , it can only prevent the next pulse from beginning the accumulation process .    for example , at sns , plcs monitor magnet current transformers on the power supplies for the last few magnets in the transport line to the target .",
    "if the magnet current strays outside pre - determined limits , the beam will be automatically turned off .",
    "the time for a plc trip to turn off the beam is about 50  ms . as an additional precaution",
    ", plc trips also turn off the high voltage to the ion source and turn off the high voltage to the first few klystrons .",
    "the third - fastest method is faults detected by the control computers .",
    "the computers interface to the mps to turn off the beam .",
    "for example , at sns , computers monitor all the magnet power supply currents in the beam transport to the target ( as read by the power supply controller  not by separate current transformers ) . the estimated time to turn off",
    "the beam is about 1  s. for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_curr_limits ] shows a partial list of these magnets and their high- and low - trip limits .     some of the power supplies in the sns beam transport from the ring to the target , and their trip limits that are monitored by the control computer . ]",
    "the fourth - fastest method is the alarm system , which alerts the operators to off - normal conditions .",
    "the alarms are generated by the control system , and require operator action to turn off the beam or to correct the off - normal condition .",
    "a strength of this method is that the control system can monitor a huge number of parameters , and also values derived from those parameters .",
    "for example , at sns , the control system alarms if the beam position on target strays outside of pre - determined limits .",
    "the estimated time to correct the alarm state is 10 to 30  s , or possibly longer , depending on the operator reaction time and the complexity of the alarm .",
    "beam loss monitors ( blms ) are a standard part of machine protection for any beam transport system , and their purpose is primarily to protect beam line components . but blms can also be used to protect a target .",
    "the idea is that a quadrupole magnet change that can cause the beam to be too small or too large at the target will sometimes also cause beam loss upstream of the target , because the mis - focused beam could be large enough somewhere along the beam line that the beam tails will strike the beam pipe walls .",
    "blms can also protect against deviations from the nominal beam trajectory that could result in a bad position on the target , if the deviation is large enough to cause beam loss . at sns",
    ", blms are located , and thresholds are set , such that some of the quadrupole magnet changes that can result in off - normal beams at the target will trip the blms .",
    "figure  [ fig : sns_quad_sensitivity ] shows , for each quadrupole magnet in the beam line from the ring to the target , how much the beam size on the target changes for a 5% change in the quadrupole magnet gradient . it also shows the greatest amount of change anywhere in the beam line .",

    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      another method to protect the target is to lock down certain control parameters .",
    "the idea is to administratively control critical hardware set points to prevent inadvertent changes .",
    "an example of this method is that at sns the operators set a gate generator at the ion source that limits the possible beam pulse lengths , which limits the beam power on the target .",
    "high beam power facilities often have collimators in the last part of the beam transport leading to the target , to protect against large beam position variations and overly large beam sizes , and to ensure that the beam hits the central region of the target .",
    "for example , sns has a collimator immediately upstream of the target .",
    "the @xmath9  @xmath10 aperture is smaller than the face of the target , but slightly larger than the nominal beam size ( 90% of beam must fit within a @xmath11  @xmath10 rectangle ) .",
    "sns also has collimators in the beam transport line that can intercept a portion of the beam that does not receive the nominal kick angle from the extraction kickers , thus protecting the target from some of the mis - kicked beam that would consequently arrive off centre at the target .",
    "figure  [ fig : tgt_coll ] shows the collimator that is embedded in the bulk shielding surrounding the sns target , fig .  [ fig : rtbt_tgt ] shows the positions of the beam line collimators , and fig .

    "the thin lines indicate trajectory deviations for individual missed kicks , and the thick lines indicate the maximum and minimum trajectory deviations for the case of two simultaneous missed kicks .",
    "figure reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      this protection category involves continuously monitoring critical beam parameters , and then automatically turning off the beam if the parameters exceed pre - determined thresholds .",

    "for example , small adjustments to dipole magnets should not cause large position changes on the target , and small adjustments to quadrupole magnets should not cause large beam size changes on the target . at sns , one way this design practice was implemented was to require the phase advance from the extraction kickers to the target to be approximately a multiple of @xmath13 . in this way",
    ", a missed kick from an extraction kicker will not cause a large position change on the target .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",

    ", there is a waveform monitor on each of the eight extraction kickers .",
    "a plc monitors some of the quadrupole and dipole magnet power supply currents .",
    "a plc also monitors the beam profile measurement device upstream of the target , and it is possible to connect this to the machine protection system , but presently this is not the case . a recent addition to the mps interlock system is a fast beam current monitor to shut off the beam if the beam current exceeds a pre - defined limit .",
    "the numi neutrino production target at fnal now operates with 120 gev , approximately 400 kw protons , < 1  hz , with an upgrade to 700  kw planned in 2015 . a later upgrade to >",
    "1  mw is planned .",
    "prior to beam extraction from the main injector ( mi ) , more than 250 different inputs to the beam permit system are checked @xcite .",
    "the beam is sent to the abort dump if inputs are not correct .",
    "the inputs checked include the following : beam position and angle for the mi extraction channel , possible excessive residual mi beam in the kicker beam gap , the extraction kicker status , proper numi power supply flat - top values , the beam readiness of the target station and absorbers , all beam loss monitor readings from the previous extraction , and the previous pulse position and trajectory at the target .",
    "the beam delivery system also has an automatic beam steering system to keep the beam centred on the target .",
    "if a beam pulse is > 1.5  mm off centre , the beam is automatically turned off .",
    "the isis facility at ral operates two targets , ts1 and ts2 .",
    "ts1 operates with 800 mev , 160 kw , 40  hz protons , and ts2 operates with 800  mev , 40  kw , 10  hz protons . a beam halo monitor ( comprising eight equally spaced thermocouples in the penumbra of the beam @xmath14100 mm upstream of the target ) indicates mis - focused and mis - steered beams .",
    "if the thermocouple signals exceed pre - determined trip thresholds , the protection system turns off the beam .",
    "the protection system @xcite is capable of turning off the machine within 2  ms and hence inhibits the next beam pulse from the ion source in the 50 hz synchrotron cycle .",
    "there is also a steering servo system to accommodate variations in the upstream beam .",
    "the servo and trip system is slow , running at @xmath142  s. on ts2 there is also a harp profile monitor which sits permanently in the beam , but this is not interlocked .",
    "a similar harp is planned for ts1 as part of an upgrade project .",
    "to provide a detailed example of target protection , we will now discuss the sns case .",
    "we will be referring to the beam instrumentation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtbt_bi ] . the initial beam tuning to the target",
    "is performed at low intensity , low power , 1  hz ( < 1  kw ) beam .",
    "once the beam position has been adjusted to centre the beam on the target , the beam power is slowly increased to full intensity , but still at 1  hz ( @xmath1423  kw ) .",
    "the beam intensity is now high enough that an image can be seen on the target imaging system ( tis ) , which is based on a light - emitting coating on the surface of the target , and hence gives a direct measurement of beam position and beam distribution at the target .",
    "the tis is used to check the beam centring , and then the beam size is measured not with the tis ( due to unresolved discrepancies with the measurement technique about to be discussed ) , but with the four wire scanners and one harp located at various positions in the ring to target beam transport ( rtbt ) beam line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtbt_bi ] .",
    "the beam size at the target is determined by fitting the measured rms beam sizes with an online model , and varying the simulated beam parameters until the best fit to the measured rms beam sizes is obtained .",
    "the model is then used to extrapolate the beam size at the target .",
    "an example fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtbt_fit ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : rtbt_fit_table ] shows the corresponding output table with the extrapolated beam size at the target .    the same online model is then used to extrapolate the peak beam density , measured with the harp , to the target .",
    "the critical beam parameters for the target have now been measured . to meet requirements :    * the beam must be centred on the target to within 6 mm horizontal and 4 mm vertical ; * the rms beam size must be < 49 mm horizontal and < 17 mm vertical ; * the peak density on target must be less than @xmath15 protons / m@xmath16 ; * the peak density on the proton beam window must be less than @xmath17 protons / m@xmath16 .",
    "once the measured beam parameters have been determined to meet requirements , the beam delivery system is locked down .",
    "this is required before increasing the beam power above 100  kw .",
    "the lock down is accomplished by engaging the following interlock thresholds .",

    "<S> target protection is an important part of machine protection . </S>",
    "<S> the beam power in high - intensity accelerators is high enough that a single wayward pulse can cause serious damage . </S>",
    "<S> today s high - power targets operate at the limit of available technology , and are designed for a very narrow range of beam parameters . if the beam pulse is too far off centre , or if the beam size is not correct , or if the beam density is too high , the target can be seriously damaged </S>",
    "<S> . we will start with a brief introduction to high - power targets and then move to a discussion of what can go wrong , and what are the risks . </S>",
    "<S> next we will discuss how to control the beam - related risk , followed by examples from a few different accelerator facilities . </S>",
