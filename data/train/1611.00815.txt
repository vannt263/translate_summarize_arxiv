    "what is the time ?",
    "when people want to measure the time , people use a clock . all clocks utilize a `` periodic '' motion , for example , many clocks often have a structure of harmonic oscillator which has the same period , _ i.e. _ frequency , for all initial points .",
    "hence almost all people interpret the time as the number of times of an initial point coming back to the initial point .",
    "in particular , the harmonic oscillator is an object in continuum dynamical systems . in this paper , we want to investigate about periodic motion in discrete dynamical systems .    for a map @xmath0 and",
    "a fixed number @xmath1 , the @xmath0 is called a periodic recurrence equation(pre ) of period @xmath2 , when for all initial points of the @xmath0 are @xmath2 periodic points@xcite@xcite .",
    "there is similar argument @xcite from different point of view .    for examples@xcite :    * pre of period 2(dim 1 ) : @xmath3 * pre of period 5(dim 2 ) : @xmath4    we can check the periodicity for these maps : all initial points , all orbits can be explicitly written in `` symbolic '' calculus as follows :    * pre of period 2 : @xmath5 * pre of period 5 : @xmath6    here , `` symbolic '' means `` do nt touch any information of initial points '' .",
    "this fact is the key point of the present paper .",
    "a pre can be interpreted as a `` clock '' in discrete dynamical systems . in particular ,",
    "a set of pre is a `` basis '' for an integrable system , like a set of harmonic oscillators is a basis for periodic function _",
    "i.e. _ fourier basis .",
    "the meaning of this will be discussed in conclusion .    until recently , well known examples of pre are mostly low dimensional cases@xcite@xcite@xcite . however , in @xcite , authors give a procedure for derivation of infinitely many higher dimensional cases using the structure of invariant variety of periodic points(ivpp)@xcite@xcite@xcite . here",
    ", ivpp is a variety of periodic points which cover some level sets . in this paper",
    ", we would give a new procedure for derivation of infinitely many higher dimensional pres from a low dimensional pre and/or a map which has ivpp using by symbolic structure of pre .    in this paper ,",
    "our discussion is based on @xmath7 dimensional complex rational maps @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the rational function field over @xmath10 .",
    "for studying a concrete map like ( [ rm ] ) , we often use some computer softwares , for examples , mathematica , maple etc ... , and when we are carrying out calculations and writing graphs for finding some structures of the map as complex map on these softwares , we must rewrite an explicit form which replaces each variable @xmath11 by @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "this replacement is the first step for our procedure .",
    "furthermore , the complex number often interpreted as a 2 dimensional vector over @xmath14 , and then the map ( [ rm ] ) also can be interpreted as a @xmath15 dimensional real map @xmath16:\\mathbb{r}^{2d}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^{2d}$ ] which the symbol `` @xmath17 $ ] '' means one step after our procedure for the map ( [ rm ] ) . here , once again",
    ", we replace the real variables in @xmath16 $ ] by complex variables , therefore we get a new @xmath15 dimensional complex map @xmath16:\\mathbb{c}^{2d}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{c}^{2d}$ ] .",
    "these replacements are the second step for our procedure .",
    "these steps can be iterated @xmath2 times for any @xmath1 .",
    "hence we can get a @xmath18 dimensional complex map @xmath19 $ ] for any @xmath1 .",
    "the sequence of higher dimensional maps @xmath20 \\}_{n\\in \\mathbb{n}}$ ] is our main implement .",
    "a pre provides periodic motion for symbolic calculus , then the pre conserves of this periodic structure by taking our procedure .",
    "it means that variables of a pre are not related in neither abstract notation nor explicit notation .",
    "for example , when variables are written @xmath21 or @xmath22 , the pre provides periodic motion of the same period .    before finishing this section ,",
    "we give the outline of this paper : in  2 , we introduce about ivpp for derivation of rpes , in  3 , we show our procedure , in  4 , we give some examples , and in  5 we give conclusion .",
    "in this section , we give a review about invariant variety of periodic points(ivpp)@xcite@xcite@xcite and derivation of ivpps from singularity confinement(sc)@xcite to obtain pres@xcite .",
    "an ivpp of period @xmath2 of a @xmath7 dimensional rational map @xmath23 with @xmath24 invariants @xmath25 is defined as a variety of periodic points of period @xmath2 @xmath26 which is given by only the invariants @xmath27    the ivpp has an important property which is called the ivpp theorem ,    _ let f be a @xmath7 dimensional rational map with @xmath24 invariants . if @xmath28 , an ivpp and discrete periodic points on a level set of any period do not exist in one map , simultaneously .",
    "_    a map ( [ rm1 ] ) can be restricted on a level set . because , any initial points on a level set are confined on this level set .",
    "moreover an ivpp of period @xmath2 is a level set and a set of @xmath2 periodic points .",
    "therefore a map on an ivpp of period @xmath2 becomes a pre of period @xmath2 .",
    "the ivpp also has an important phenomenon , that is the derivation of a sequence of ivpps from sc@xcite@xcite , and then it is equivalent to the phenomenon which gives a sequence of pres .",
    "first we give a simple example for the explanation of this phenomenon :    * 2 dimensional mbius map@xcite : @xmath29 with an invariant , @xmath30 * parametrize an initial point @xmath31 for sc by the invariant : @xmath32 * make an orbit of iterations of the map ( [ 2mob ] ) for the initial point ( [ ip ] ) : @xmath33 notice that @xmath31 goes back to a finite point keeping information of @xmath31 , this phenomenon is called sc@xcite@xcite . *",
    "take `` a condition for the point going back to infinity after @xmath2 iterations of the map , again '' .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the condition of ivpp of period @xmath2 : @xmath34 * restrict the map ( [ 2mob ] ) on the ivpp of period @xmath2 .",
    "this map is a pre of period @xmath2 : @xmath35 check : @xmath36    more generally , the algorithm of derivation of ivpps and pres from sc is as follows :    1 .",
    "solve the @xmath7 conditions for parametrizing the initial point @xmath37 by the invariants : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the denominators of @xmath40 iterated map of the component @xmath41 .",
    "2 .   compute @xmath42 iteratively to find @xmath43 , which is a polynomial function of the invariants , and where `` sc step '' @xmath44 is the number of iterations necessary to go back to a finite point .",
    "3 .   take @xmath45 irreducible polynomials , one from each of the set @xmath46 if the polynomials in this set are all independent , the intersection of the elements is a set of periodic points of period @xmath2 .",
    "4 .   restrict the map on the ivpp of period @xmath2 , then we get a @xmath45 dimensional pre of period @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we give our procedure for the derivation of a sequence of higher dimensional maps by some base maps .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath7 dimensional `` complex '' map ( [ rm1 ] ) @xmath47 with @xmath24 `` complex '' invariants ( [ inv1 ] ) @xmath48    the map @xmath0 is @xmath7 dimensional complex map and @xmath49 are @xmath24 complex invariants , however it is not clear in our representation ( [ rm1 ] ) , ( [ inv1 ] ) .",
    "now we define the complexified map @xmath50 to give an explicit form .",
    "therefore we can rewrite the map @xmath0 to an explicit form as follows @xmath51 : ( x_1 , \\dots , x_d , x_{d+1 } , \\dots , x_{2d } ) \\mapsto ( x_1 , \\dots , x_d , x_{d+1 } , \\dots , x_{2d}),\\ ] ] where @xmath52_i , \\quad i=1,\\dots , d , \\label{com - map}\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ @xmath53(x_1 , \\dots , x_{2d})]_i= \\re([f ( a^{(1)}_1 ( x_1 ) , \\dots , a^{(1)}_d(x_d))]_i ) , \\\\ x_{d+i } & = &   [ f[1](x_1 , \\dots , x_{2d})]_{d+i}= \\im ( [ f ( a^{(1)}_1 ( x_1 ) , \\dots , a^{(1)}_d(x_d))]_i ) , \\quad \\quad i=1,\\dots , d.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    usually , we think that ( [ com - map ] ) is @xmath15 dimensional real map with @xmath54 real invariants , _ i.e. _ @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . here",
    "we replace the real variables @xmath57 by complex variables .",
    "therefore , of course we get a @xmath15 dimensional complex map with @xmath15 complex invariants .",
    "furthermore we can iterate this procedure for any times !",
    "therefore we can get a @xmath58 dimensional complex map with @xmath59 complex invariants for any @xmath1 @xmath60 ( a^{(n)}_1 ( x_1 ) , \\dots , a^{(n)}_{nd } ( x_{nd}))]_i ) , \\\\",
    "x_{2nd+i } & = & \\im([f[n ] ( a^{(n)}_1 ( x_1 ) , \\dots , a^{(n)}_{nd } ( x_{nd}))]_i ) , \\quad i=1,\\dots , 2nd,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by @xmath2-th complexified map , @xmath61 where @xmath19 $ ] is given by taking our procedure for @xmath2 steps .",
    "now we give small remark that if a map satisfies the condition @xmath28 for ivpp theorem , then this condition is preserved at @xmath62 , because , @xmath63    however , a difference of dimension @xmath58 and the number of invariants @xmath59 is increased by @xmath45 at each step , hence , we must use the generalized algorithm of derivations of ivpps from sc when we calculate the ivpps for the map @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "in this section , we give some examples of our procedure .      the base map is the pre of period 2 ( [ 2pre ] ) @xmath64 then we get a `` doublet map '' as follows @xmath65 by the doublet variables @xmath66 .",
    "and then we get a `` quadruplet map '' as follows @xmath67 by the quadruplet variables @xmath68 .    of course ,",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) are pre of period 2 .",
    "the base map is the pre of period 5 ( [ 5pre ] ) @xmath69 then we get a `` doublet map '' as follows @xmath70 by the doublet variables @xmath68 .",
    "and the orbit of the map ( [ 54 ] ) is @xmath71 therefore we could check the map ( [ 54 ] ) is a pre of period 5 .",
    "the base map is the 2 dimensional mbius map ( [ 2mob ] ) @xmath72 with the invariant ( [ 2mob - inv ] ) @xmath73    we know general formula of the ivpps ( [ ivpp ] ) of the map ( [ 2mob ] ) as follows@xcite : @xmath74 and explicit forms , which will be discussed in this paper , as follows : @xmath75    ) ]    then we get `` doublet map '' as follows @xmath76 with doublet invariants @xmath77 by the doublet variables @xmath68 .    here",
    "we need the ivpp for the map ( [ dmap ] ) for to get res .",
    "we use a method of derivations of ivpps from sc :    1 .",
    "parametrize an initial point for sc : @xmath78 2 .",
    "make the flow of iterations of the map(for short , we write only component of @xmath21 ) : @xmath79 3 .",
    "the conditions @xmath80 give ivpp and so on .",
    "the ivpp ( [ ivpp12 ] ) has period 12 , because if we drop the imaginary part _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath81 , then the condition ( [ ivpp12 ] ) becomes common part of ivpp of period 3 and 4 .",
    "and then , we get the pre of period 12 which is restricted the map ( [ dmap ] ) on the ivpp ( [ ivpp12 ] ) as follows @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for easy to write .",
    "we give a flow of the ( [ mob12 ] ) in appendix .",
    "when the doubled map ( [ dmap ] ) is considered at @xmath86 , ( [ dmap ] ) returns to the base map ( [ 2mob ] ) .",
    "however , when the map ( [ mob12 ] ) is considered at @xmath87 , ( [ mob12 ] ) dose not return to a 1 dimensional pre , hence , ( [ mob12 ] ) is independent pre from the pre just given by the base map .",
    "in conclusion , our procedure could find new infinitely many pres from some base maps which are pres and/or maps have ivpps .",
    "in particular , last example , the 2 dimensional mbius map suggest some fact as follows : for a @xmath7 dimensional map @xmath0 with @xmath24 invariants , if @xmath0 has sc step @xmath88 by the conditions that @xmath89 denominators are zero for derivation of ivpps , then @xmath19 $ ] has sc step @xmath90 by conditions that @xmath91 denominators are zero for derivation of ivpps",
    ". therefore , we can get periodic points which have only greater than @xmath91 period , and concrete period is given a formula as follows , @xmath92    furthermore , @xcite suggested that a derivation of sequence of ivpps from sc is interpreted as projective resolution of singularity of a map in a triangulated category .",
    "we reinterpret the fact by our results that a map can be expanded by a sequence of pres like a fourier expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ , a map @xmath93 which has ivpp can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is pre of period @xmath2 which is to restrict on an ivpp of period @xmath2 .    in this paper , the complexified map([cm ] ) is performed of our procedure .",
    "however , it does not need to restrict on complexified . because our procedure uses only symbolical `` algebraic structure '' of the pre .",
    "hence , we need only algebraic structure which are included every operation for the pre . therefore , for example",
    ", if we do nt need the commutativity , then we can use `` quaternion '' .",
    "a most simplest example , which is given by transformation @xmath96 for the pre of period 2 ( [ 2pre ] ) as follows , @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
