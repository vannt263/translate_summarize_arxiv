    "the study , over the past twenty - five years , of black holes and solitons in classical non - abelian gauge theories coupled to gravity has revealed many surprises .",
    "the first surprise was the discovery @xcite of nontrivial regular soliton solutions of @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory in asymptotically flat space - time .",

    "soon after , corresponding nontrivial hairy black hole solutions of asymptotically flat @xmath0 eym theory were also discovered @xcite .",
    "although the asymptotically flat soliton and black hole solutions are unstable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations of the metric and non - abelian gauge field @xcite , their discovery sparked what is now an extensive literature on classical soliton and black hole solutions of the eym equations , see for example @xcite for reviews . for the @xmath0 gauge group and asymptotically flat space - times",
    ", it can be proven that the gauge field must be purely magnetic for nontrivial configurations @xcite and is described by a single function @xmath1 of the radial coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath1 must have at least one zero @xcite .",
    "the solutions can be parameterized by @xmath3 , the radius of the event horizon ( for the black hole case , setting @xmath4 gives the soliton case ) and @xmath5 , the number of zeros of the gauge field function @xmath1 .",
    "more complicated matter models involving yang - mills gauge fields have also been extensively studied .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite asymptotically flat soliton and hairy black hole solutions are found in two models where the yang - mills gauge symmetry is broken . the first model , einstein - non - abelian - proca ( enap ) theory , is an effective theory in which the yang - mills gauge field is given a nonzero mass term in the lagrangian . in the second model , einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory",
    ", the gauge field acquires a mass dynamically via its coupling to a higgs field in the fundamental representation .",
    "the black holes and solitons in the two models presented in @xcite are very similar and share many properties with the pure eym solutions , in particular the @xmath0 gauge field is purely magnetic and described by a single function @xmath1 which must have at least one zero . however , the phase space of solutions is more complicated , with two branches of solutions existing , so that there are two solutions for each value of @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 for solitons ) and @xmath5 .",
    "solutions on the first branch , denoted the @xmath6 branch ( for @xmath7 ) , are very similar to the corresponding @xmath6 eym solitons or black holes , as applicable , and do not vary much as either the proca field mass ( for enap ) or higgs coupling ( for eymh ) vary .",
    "in particular , as either the proca field mass or higgs coupling tends to zero , the solutions approach the relevant @xmath6 solution of pure eym theory in asymptotically flat space - time .",

    ", the value of @xmath2 at the outermost zero of @xmath1 tends to infinity as either the proca field mass or higgs coupling tends to zero and the solutions approach the corresponding @xmath8 solution of pure eym theory .",

    "considering purely magnetic configurations with an @xmath0 gauge group , solutions exist for which the gauge field function @xmath1 has no zeros , at least some of which are stable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite ( and also under general linear perturbations @xcite ) .",
    "the phase space of solutions also has a different structure compared to the asymptotically flat case . for the @xmath0 gauge group",
    ", the phase space can be taken to be @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 for solitons ) and a single additional parameter governing the behaviour of the gauge field either near the origin or near the event horizon , as applicable . in asymptotically flat space - time",
    ", nontrivial eym solutions occur at discrete values of the additional parameter for fixed @xmath3 , but in asymptotically ads space - time , there are solutions in continuous regions of the phase space .",
    "a natural question is whether these remarkable differences between soliton and black hole solutions of eym in asymptotically flat and asymptotically ads space - times persist if an extended model is considered .",
    "it is perhaps at first sight surprising that this is not the case for the eymh model @xcite .",
    "the asymptotically ads soliton and black hole solutions of this model behave similarly to those in asymptotically flat space - time . in particular , the gauge field function @xmath1 has at least one zero ; there are two branches of solutions for which @xmath1 has @xmath5 zeros ; and the solutions are unstable ( proven in @xcite for solitons and in @xcite for black holes ) .",

    "we anticipate that solutions for which @xmath1 has more than two zeros also exist .    as with the pure eym and eymh systems , the linearized enap perturbation equations decouple into two sectors , the gravitational and sphaleronic sectors .",
    "all the soliton solutions studied , and the black holes on the @xmath149 , quasi-@xmath150 , and @xmath150 branches have instabilities in the gravitational sector of perturbations .",
    "however , we were unable to find any unstable gravitational sector perturbations for black hole solutions lying on the quasi-@xmath175 branch .",
    "we therefore studied the sphaleronic sector of perturbations for quasi-@xmath175 black holes , and all solutions studied had unstable modes in this sector .",
    "the perturbation equations are sufficiently complicated that numerical analysis is necessary , and therefore our stability analysis only applies to equilibrium solutions for which the gauge potential function @xmath1 has either one or two zeros .",

    "since the gauge field is in the vacuum configuration at infinity , far from the event horizon the black hole solutions we find are indistinguishable from schwarzschild - ads black holes .",
    "these black holes are therefore counter - examples to the `` no - hair '' conjecture , in a similar way to the asymptotically flat pure eym coloured black holes @xcite . however , the pure eym coloured black holes are unstable @xcite and , as a result , bizon formulated a generalized no - hair conjecture , which states that @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ within a given matter model , a _ stable _ stationary black hole is uniquely determined by global charges . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the pure eym coloured black holes satisfy this generalized no - hair conjecture since they are unstable .",
    "the asymptotically flat enap and eymh solitons and black holes are also unstable @xcite , as are the asymptotically ads eymh solitons @xcite and black holes @xcite . as conjectured in @xcite ,",
    "it is therefore not surprising that all the asymptotically ads enap solitons and black holes studied in this paper are also unstable .",
    "in contrast with the enap and eymh systems , there exist stable soliton and black hole solutions of pure eym theory in asymptotically ads space - time @xcite .",
    "a natural question is what is special about eym theory which permits the existence of stable solutions , while its generalizations enap and eymh do not ? we argue that the boundary conditions satisfied by the gauge field at infinity are crucial . in the eym case , for asymptotically ads space - times",
    "the boundary conditions on the gauge field as @xmath55 are not very restrictive : the gauge function @xmath1 must tend to a constant , but that constant is arbitrary .",
    "this means that the gauge field near the ads boundary is not necessarily in its vacuum configuration . on the other hand , for eym in asymptotically flat space - time",
    ", it must be the case that @xmath291 as @xmath55 , which is much more restrictive and in particular means that the gauge field is in its vacuum configuration at infinity . in the enap and eymh models , in both asymptotically flat and asymptotically ads space - times , as @xmath55 it must be the case that @xmath1 approaches its vacuum value @xmath292 ( there is also a boundary condition on the higgs field in the eymh model , but that is less important for our discussion here ) .",
    "from the point of view of bizon s generalized no - hair conjecture , if the non - abelian gauge field is in the vacuum configuration at infinity , there can be no nonzero non - abelian charges to distinguish the black holes from the embedded schwarzschild or schwarzschild - ads solutions .",
    "on the other hand , if the gauge field has a nonvacuum configuration at infinity , then one would expect the existence of nonzero charges defined far from the black hole .",
    "indeed , in the pure eym case , it has been argued @xcite that such non - abelian charges uniquely characterize at least a subset of stable asymptotically ads hairy black holes .",
    "thus we have a consistent picture of black holes in the eym / enap / eymh models , in accordance with the generalized no - hair conjecture : black holes which are indistinguishable from schwarzschild(-ads ) at infinity are unstable ; and there appears to be a set of global charges uniquely characterizing stable hairy black holes .    from a physical point of view , the massless nature of the non - abelian gauge field in the eym model seems to be crucial in asymptotically ads space - times .",
    "although the ads boundary is at an infinite proper distance from the origin , it can be reached in a finite affine parameter by a null geodesic .",
    "therefore massless fields can extend all the way to the ads boundary , as is the case in the eym model .",
    "this can be seen in the boundary condition on the gauge field as @xmath55 @xcite , which in the pure eym case means that the gauge potential function @xmath1 approaches its asymptotic value slowly , so that @xmath293 as @xmath55 .",
    "massive fields are however confined to the interior of ads . in both the enap and eymh models ,",
    "the gauge field has a mass ( an effective term in the lagrangian in the enap case , and dynamically generated in the eymh case ) , localising the field either near the origin or in the vicinity of the event horizon .",
    "again this is reflected in the boundary conditions on the gauge field , which now decays more quickly to its asymptotic value , @xmath294 where @xmath295 ( [ bcinf3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "in asymptotically flat space - time , the instability of the pure eym solitons and black holes can be understood as resulting from an unstable balance between the attractive gravitational force and a repulsive force due to the non - abelian gauge field . in this picture",
    "the gauge field will tend to either collapse under gravity or radiate away to infinity if it is perturbed ( as borne out by nonlinear simulations of the evolution of the unstable asymptotically flat eym solitons and black holes @xcite ) .",
    "in asymptotically ads space - time , the gauge field is unable to radiate away to infinity , either because it will be reflected at the time - like ads boundary ( in the massless case ) , or because the diverging effective gravitational potential on the boundary means that the field is unable to escape to infinity ( in the massive case ) . for massive gauge fields in the enap and eymh models ,",
    "since the gauge field is localized either near the origin or event horizon , the balance between the gravitational attraction and gauge field repulsion is unstable , and we conjecture that the gauge field will collapse under gravity and the end - point of the instability of both solitons and black holes will be a schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "however , in the massless pure eym case , it is possible to have a stable balance between the gauge field repulsion and gravitational attraction , as the gauge field can extend all the way out to infinity . in this case",
    "the gauge field configuration could be thought of as being analogous to a fundamental standing wave for a bounded system . a fully nonlinear study of the evolution of both the stable eym solutions and the unstable enap / eymh solutions would be required to investigate this picture further , and we leave this to future work .    the work of ew is supported by the lancaster - manchester - sheffield consortium for fundamental physics under stfc grant st / l000520/1 , and by an erskine visiting fellowship at the university of canterbury , christchurch , new zealand .",
