    "the nonlinearity in the navier - stokes equations gives rise to an interaction between different length - scales in a turbulent flow .",
    "these interactions are the basic mechanism behind the celebrated kolmogorov - richardson energy cascade @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological picture of energy cascading from scale to scale towards the scales in which dissipation becomes appreciable is the cornerstone of a large number of turbulence models ( _ e.g. _ reference @xcite ) .",
    "if locality in scale - space is assumed , energy - conservation and local - isotropy will lead to a wavenumber dependence of the energy spectrum of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 the energy flux , which , using the assumption of statistical stationarity , equals the energy dissipation .",
    "a physical space equivalent of this scaling law is the scale dependence of the second - order longitudinal structure function , @xmath3 the definitions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 will be given below .",
    "the possibility of corrections to the inertial range scaling of structure functions , due to the intermittent character of the energy dissipation @xcite , was taken into account in a more general theory advanced by kolmogorov and oboukhov @xcite .",
    "experiments aiming at the measurement of the intermittency corrections ( _ e.g. _ reference @xcite ) indeed showed small corrections to the scaling which could be due to intermittency , in particular for higher - order structure functions .",
    "subsequently a large number of phenomenological models was proposed to describe the intermittent character of turbulence .",
    "reference @xcite gives an overview of work on intermittency upto 1995 .",
    "one of the more successful models , in the sense of reproducing the different features of isotropic turbulence , is the multifractal model @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological description compares well to measurements and gives non - zero intermittency corrections to the inertial range scaling of the energy spectrum and of higher order quantities .",
    "a valuable theoretical tool to study the statistical properties of homogeneous turbulence is two - point closure theory .",
    "the first theoretical approach of this kind , derived from the navier - stokes equations , is the direct interaction approximation ( dia ) @xcite .",
    "subsequent improvements @xcite of this theory allowed to show that the @xmath6 dependence of the energy spectrum can be related directly to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "simplifications led to different related closures such as the test - field model @xcite , the lagrangian renormalized approximation @xcite and the eddy - damped quasi - normal approximation ( edqnm ) @xcite .",
    "edqnm is of the closures named here the simplest .",
    "it is obtained by assuming in the dia formulation that the two - time correlations decay exponentially with a typical time - scale modeled phenomenologically .",
    "we note that this time - scale can also be determined self - consistently within the edqnm approach @xcite .",
    "these closures , although directly related to the navier - stokes equations , do not yield any intermittency corrections to the scaling ( [ k41 ] ) .",
    "however , the predicted results for scaling exponents of the energy spectrum compare rather well to experimentally observed values @xcite . indeed , at low reynolds numbers , corrections to the scaling exponents due to the finite reynolds number are usually larger than the expected intermittency corrections and these finite reynolds number effects vanish very slowly @xcite .",
    "the fact that two - point closure and the multifractal formalism can treat both low and very high reynolds numbers using limited computational effort , makes these approaches very attractive to study reynolds - number effects .",
    "the present work will compare the predictions of closure for second and third - order quantities with results of the multifractal description .",
    "this will allow to show to what extent intermittency corrections can be distinguished from reynolds number effects at low , moderate and high reynolds numbers .",
    "we choose to compare quantities in physical space , since most experimental and theoretical efforts aiming at the understanding and description of intermittency focus on these quantities ( we note however that in principle intermittency corrections , if any , should also be observed in wavenumber spectra ) .",
    "therefore we need to convert the fourier - space quantities into physical space quantities .",
    "it is described in the next section how this is done . the relations to convert physical space quantities into their fourier - space counterparts",
    "is also given . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we will present the edqnm model and we will give an outline of the multifractal description . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present the results of the edqnm model for these quantities and compare with the multifractal results in both fourier and physical space . section [ sec5 ]",
    "concludes this article .",
    "in this section we will give the relation between the energy spectrum and the second order structure function @xmath4 , and between the nonlinear transfer and the third - order longitudinal velocity structure function , @xmath7 . even though the relations given here are not new ( e.g. @xcite ) , the details of the derivation are dispersed or not well documented in literature and we think that it is therefore worth to write down in detail this derivation , which can be found in the appendix .",
    "the starting point is the navier - stokes equations for incompressible flow , @xmath8 with @xmath9 the density and @xmath10 the pressure .",
    "time arguments are omitted for brevity .",
    "the three - dimensional fourier transfer is defined as @xmath11 in fourier space the navier - stokes equations can be written @xmath12 with @xmath13 to derive ( [ nsf ] ) , the incompressibility condition was used to eliminate the pressure term . in isotropic non - helical turbulence ,",
    "the energy spectrum is related to @xmath14 by @xmath15 and since @xmath16 is real , this gives @xmath17 in order to derive the equation for @xmath5 , we multiply ( [ nsf ] ) by @xmath18 .",
    "then we write a similar equation for @xmath18 and multiply by @xmath14 summing both equations and averaging yields , @xmath19e(k)&=&i\\pi k^2 p_{ijm}(\\bm k)\\left[t_{ijm}(\\bm k)-t_{ijm}^*(\\bm k)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & t(k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 by isotropy it can be shown that @xmath21 .",
    "the rhs of the lin - equation ( [ lin2 ] ) is the nonlinear transfer @xmath22 , which we will relate to the third - order longitudinal structure function .",
    "but first we will give the relation between the energy spectrum and the second order longitudinal structure function .",
    "the second order longitudinal structure function is defined as @xmath23 with @xmath24 its relation to the energy spectrum is @xmath25 with @xmath26 given by @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivation of this expression is given in the appendix .",
    "a convenient expression to compute the energy spectrum from the second order structure function is @xmath28 { \\mathrm{d}}r\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we refer to mathieu and scott @xcite for the derivation .",
    "the third order longitudinal structure function in homogeneous turbulence can be expressed as @xmath29 which is related to the transfer spectrum by @xmath30 with @xmath31 with details given in the appendix .",
    "the equivalent expression to compute the transfer spectrum from @xmath7 is @xcite , @xmath32        { \\mathrm{d}}r.\\ ] ]      before continuing , let us have a look at the behavior of the functions ( [ fx ] ) and ( [ gx ] ) , @xmath33\\\\ g(x)=12 \\frac{3 \\left(\\sin x - x\\cos x\\right)-x^2\\sin x}{x^5}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taylor expansions of the sine and cosine terms show that for @xmath34 , @xmath35 using this in ( [ eqdllf ] ) and ( [ eqdlll5 ] ) , we find for very small @xmath36 , @xmath37 in which we used that @xmath38 with @xmath2 the energy dissipation .",
    "so we find that the structure functions of order @xmath39 and @xmath40 scale as @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively for very small @xmath36 , which is expected since at small enough scales the flow can be considered as smooth .",
    "the velocity - increment skewness is defined as @xmath43 since at very small scales @xmath44 one finds that @xmath45 using expressions ( [ dll00 ] ) and ( [ dlll0 ] ) , we find @xcite , @xmath46}{[(\\partial_xu)^2]^{3/2}}=-\\frac{15^{3/2}}{35(2)^{1/2}}\\frac{\\int_0^{\\infty}k^2 t(k)dk } { [ \\int_0^{\\infty}k^2 e(k)dk ] ^{3/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of high - reynolds number , if the non - stationarity can be neglected at high @xmath47 , or if the turbulence is kept stationary by a forcing term acting only at small @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 so that @xcite @xmath49^{3/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the velocity - derivative skewness is then completely determined by moments of the energy spectrum . using ( [ defeps ] ) , and assuming an inertial range spectrum extending upto @xmath50 of the form @xmath51 we obtain for @xmath52 @xmath53 substituting this in ( [ sbatch ] ) we obtain , @xmath54 in which we used that the taylor - scale reynolds number , to be defined later , is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "it follows from this expression that the velocity derivative skewness is independent of the reynolds number if @xmath56 .",
    "if corrections to the kolmogorov 1941 ( k41 ) scaling are present , as is the case in the multi - fractal formalism , the skewness becomes a function of the reynolds number .",
    "this dependence is by ( [ skewre ] ) directly related to the intermittency correction to the k41 scaling .",
    "at large @xmath36 we find @xmath57 which is expected from ( [ eqdll0 ] ) since at large separation distances the correlation between the velocity at two points is supposed to vanish .",
    "@xmath7 tends for the same reason to zero for large separation distances @xmath36 . at large @xmath36",
    "the velocity increment skewness should therefore go smoothly to zero , since the velocity correlation should decay smoothly at large @xmath36 .",
    "the exact way in which @xmath7 tends to zero depends on the behavior of the energy spectrum at the very low wavenumbers .",
    "we performed simulations of the edqnm model in the unforced case by integrating numerically eq .",

    "forced simulations are evaluated when a steady state is reached .",
    "the forcing in these cases corresponds to a region @xmath77 , in which the energy spectrum is kept constant .      in this section",
    "some key concepts of the multi - fractal description will be presented .",
    "a more detailed presentation and references can be found in appendix [ appmf ] .    in the multifractal description",
    "the velocity - increments @xmath78 at scales @xmath36 in the inertial range are modeled by the product of two independent random variables @xmath79 in this expression @xmath80 is a zero average gaussian random variable of variance @xmath81 , where @xmath81 is twice the mean - square of the velocity fluctuations .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 introduces the scale dependence in the statistics of the velocity increments .",
    "it is defined as @xmath83 with @xmath84 the integral lengthscale .",
    "the particularity of the approach lies in the fact that the exponent @xmath85 is a fluctuating quantity .",

    "was proposed by paladin and vulpiani @xcite and nelkin @xcite .",
    "further details on the multi - fractal description , including the expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath89 , are given in the appendix .    ]    ]",
    "in the following we will consider three different values of the reynolds number @xmath90 these values are @xmath91 .",
    "the lowest corresponds to a typical reynolds number for laboratory experiments in jets or wind - tunnels , the second one to the highest reynolds number obtained in wind - tunnel turbulence , _ i.e. _ in the modane windtunnel @xcite , and @xmath92 corresponds to the reynolds number of large scale atmospheric flows and no controlled experimental results of isotropic turbulence are available . in the following we will present results for these reynolds numbers .",
    "all quantities are normalized by kolmogorov scales , which means that they are non - dimensionalized by using the variables @xmath93 and @xmath2 .",
    "for example , all lengthscales are normalized by @xmath94 .",
    "this normalization allows to collapse the dissipation range of the different quantities if this range becomes independent of the viscosity .",
    "this is the case in the k41 phenomenology . in the presence of intermittency",
    "this is not the case anymore .",
    "it will however been shown in the following that also in that case the dissipation ranges of the different quantities nearly collapse in the present range of reynolds numbers .    in figure",

    "this plateau drops to zero , and at large @xmath47 a viscous bottleneck is observed .",
    "since we are interested in second and third order quantities in the present work , we also show the nonlinear transfer .",

    "this modeling also causes the relatively narrow negative peak in the transfer spectrum . in the following , when presenting the structure functions",

    "the functions are compensated according to k41 scaling .",
    "the asymptotic result @xmath98 is indicated by a dashed line .",
    "[ figsf3 ] ]      we used equations ( [ eqdllf ] ) and ( [ eqdlll5 ] ) to compute the structure functions from the energy spectra and transfer spectra shown in the previous section .",
    "the results for the second order structure function are shown in figure [ figsf2 ] .",
    "we show the multifractal prediction in the same graph . in the log - log representation",
    "we clearly observe the smooth @xmath41 small scale behavior and the plateau proportional to the kinetic energy at large scales . in between a power - law dependence close to @xmath96",

    "the multifractal prediction closely ressembles the edqnm result in the dissipation range .",

    "the largest difference is observed at large @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the multifractal description does not take into account the shape of the velocity correlation at large @xmath36 .",
    "this correlation should in a realistic flow smoothly tend to zero , but this effect is not taken into account in the formalism .",
    "note that we prefer to show here the results without the _ ad - hoc _ modification proposed in the last section .",
    "we further observe that the structure function computed from edqnm , as for the energy spectra , does not display a clear plateau in the compensated representation for @xmath99 .",
    "the results for the third - order structure functions are shown in figure [ figsf3 ] .",
    "again we clearly observe the smooth small - scale behavior proportional to @xmath42 . in this range",

    ", the multifractal result closely follows the high - reynolds edqnm result up to the cut - off of the multi - fractal result .    in the center and top graph of figure",
    "[ skew ] , we compare the results also with experimental results . at @xmath102 , we compare with hot - wire measurements in an air - jet experiment @xcite . at small scales",
    "the experimental value is significantly larger than the theoretical results . at these scales",
    "the accuracy of the hot - wire probe decreases however . in the inertial range",
    "the multi - fractal approach is very close to the experimental value .",
    "the edqnm curve drops much faster to zero .",
    "inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the experimental turbulent field could be behind this discrepancy .    at @xmath0",
    "a comparison is made with the velocity increment skewness measured in the return - channel of the onera wind - tunnel in modane .",
    "the reynolds number obtained there is one of the highest measured in wind - tunnel turbulence .",
    "unfortunately at large scales the third - order statistics are not fully converged so that no smooth curve is available there .",
    "however the general trend of the curves is quite similar at all scales .",
    "a surprising fact is here the power - law that is observed in the inertial range of both the multifractal result and the edqnm result . indeed , in the multifractal approach this power - law is a signature of inertial - range intermittency and the model is developed to take this into account . in the edqnm approach , however , this power - law is a transient effect , due to the finite - reynolds number . in edqnm",
    "this power - law vanishes thus at high reynolds number .    ]    in figure [ skewre ] we show the reynolds number dependency of the longitudinal velocity derivative skewness , as computed by equation ( [ skew0 ] ) .",
    "we see that this quantity saturates for @xmath103 at a value around @xmath104 . in the multifractal approach",
    "this quantity follows a power - law of the reynolds number ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pred1 ] ) and ( [ eq : predskewgradln ] ) ) with an exponent around @xmath105 . also shown",
    "are the results of direct numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite more numerical and experimental results are available including the experimental compilation by @xcite .",
    "we chose however those which give the general trend .",
    "the dns results show a slightly increasing trend from @xmath104 to @xmath106 for a reynolds number going from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .      ]    to conclude this results section we address the influence of a large scale forcing on the scaling of the velocity increment skewness .",
    "indeed , in experiments of nearly isotropic turbulence we often consider a turbulence generated by a grid , advected by a mean velocity .",
    "this corresponds in the frame moving with the mean flow , to freely decaying turbulence .",
    "direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence are often forced at the large scales in order to obtain a as high as possible reynolds number .",
    "the difference between the two types of turbulent flows is important .",
    "for example in @xcite it was shown that the normalized dissipation rate is nearly twice as high in decaying turbulence as it is in forced turbulence .",
    "also for the appearance of scaling ranges this difference can be important .",
    "the difference between decaying and forced turbulence in approaching the asymptotic form of the third - order structure function was reported in @xcite . in figure [ fig - fd ] we show how the inertial range scaling of the energy spectrum improves when considering statistically stationary forced turbulence at the same reynolds number .",
    "we observe the appearance of a large peak in the spectrum , corresponding to the forcing .",
    "we also observe that the compensated energy spectra display a clear scaling range , already at a reynolds number of @xmath102 .",
    "the velocity - increment skewness of these forced calculations shows however no clear plateau at this reynolds number , but its inertial range behavior follows closely the @xmath0 decaying turbulence result .",
    "in the present work we computed second and third order structure functions from edqnm results .",
    "we compared these structure functions with results from the multifractal formalism .",
    "it was shown that in the near dissipation range the different approaches give very similar results .",
    "it was shown that the appearance of clear scaling ranges is very slow for the structure functions as was also observed in previous work @xcite .",
    "the results for the velocity increment skewness were also compared to experimental results .",
    "it was shown that the intermittency correction to this quantity given by the multifractal model almost collapsed with the scaling - correction induced by the finiteness of the reynolds number in the edqnm simulations .",
    "in particular at a reynolds of @xmath0 the two corrections almost coincide .",
    "this shows that at reynolds numbers currently achievable in controlled experiments and simulations , intermittency corrections to the skewness can not be distinguished from low reynolds number effects .",
    "an interesting perspective is to investigate to what extent intermittency corrections to higher - order quantities such as the flatness can be distinguished from reynolds number effects ( see e.g. ref .",
    "this task is within the framework of closure - theory far from trivial and will be left for future work .",
    "we will give here a detailed derivation of the relation between second order structure functions and the kinetic energy spectrum .",
