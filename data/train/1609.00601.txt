    "in @xcite , hereafter paper i , we presented analyses of the light curves of 639 stars in the field of m67 using data from _ kepler / k2-campaign-5_. we derived a gyro - age of @xmath2 gyr from the rotation periods of 28 sun - like single cluster members .",
    "shortly thereafter , @xcite , hereafter b16 , published independent analyses of the rotation periods of 20 m67 cluster members also using _",
    "k2 _ data ; they derived a mean gyro - age of @xmath3 gyr .",
    "there are several reasons to conduct another analysis of the rotation periods of stars in m67 using _",
    "k2 _ data .",
    "first , while these two age estimates are consistent with each other , we would like to track down the source of the 0.5 gyr age difference and try to arrive at an improved estimate .",
    "second , both studies only examined a subset of the m67 member stars observed during _ kepler / k2-campaign-5_. b16 limited their full gyro - age analysis only to 20 cluster members , all within 25 arc minutes of the cluster center and outside the inner 10 arc minutes . in paper",
    "i we restricted the sample to the same region of m67 observed by @xcite in their extensive ground - based study .",
    "third , for nearly half the stars in common between paper i and b16 , the derived rotation periods are very different .    unlike studies conducted on photometry collected during the original _ kepler _ four year mission , analyses of stellar rotation based on",
    "_ k2 _ photometry are limited to a mere 80 days or so .",
    "this is enough to sample only two to three full rotations for a typical solar age main sequence star . as we showed in paper i with simulations of rotation period extraction from solar irradiance data ,",
    "such a short timespan limits the accuracy of the derived period for a sun - like star . depending on where a particular star is on its activity cycle , it might not even be possible to derive a period for it .",
    "therefore , it becomes necessary to employ as large a sample as possible to arrive at a reliable average period for stars of a given spectral type .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to revisit the photometric variability of m67 member stars using the _ kepler / k2 campaign-5 _ data .",
    "our primary goal is to derive a more accurate mean gyro - age for the cluster .",
    "we describe and prepare the data for analysis in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "one of our goals in the present study is to improve upon the analysis of paper i by increasing the number of m67 members in our sample . in order to do so , we dropped one of the criteria adopted in that study , namely , that a star in the _ k2 _ input catalog be included in the m67 field observed by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 1 of paper 1 , their field includes stars up to about half a degree from the cluster center in the e and w directions , but their coverage is only about half as far in the n and s directions . in the following subsections we analyze the k2 light curves from the same database we used in paper i over this larger region , as well as light curves from other k2 databases .      in this section",
    "restrict our analysis of photometric variability to the same light curves archive we employed in paper i , using the pdcsap_flux values .",
    "we include all stars from the _ k2 _ input catalog within a radius of one degree from the center of m67 and with a _ kepler _ magnitude * brighter than 21 . *",
    "this yielded 988 stars .",
    "as in paper i , we determined the `` optimal '' period using the python code gatspy for each light curve .",
    "we also placed each light curve in one of the subjective categories ( see paper i ) .",
    "this step yielded 441 stars within the `` rot '' category , which yields the most reliable periods according to our analysis of solar data in section 2.5 .    in order to be more successful at selecting the true rotation period for each star ,",
    "we also employed phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) .",
    "pdm arrives at the period which minimizes the variance in a phased time series @xcite .",
    "we describe how we arrived at the final period for each star from the gatspy optimal period and the pdm period in section 2.5 .",
    "applying these selection criteria to the 441 stars in the `` rot '' category , our sample is reduced to 271 stars ( 27 percent of the original 988 stars ) .",
    "we apply additional culling steps below only to this subset of our sample .    based on our membership assignments in table 2 of paper i for the stars in common with the working sample",
    ", we removed another 81 stars as likely nonmembers of m67 .",
    "this leaves us with 190 stars . to determine the membership status of each of the remaining stars , we downloaded proper motion data from the ppmxl catalog @xcite",
    ". a total of 32,637 stars in the ppmxl catalog are located within one degree of the center of m67 . in order to use these proper motion values to decide on cluster membership ,",
    "we cross - referenced the ppmxl stars with the stars from table 2 in paper i ; we found 258 matches with members and 186 matches with nonmembers .",
    "most ( 95 per cent ) of cluster members occupy a box in proper motion space bracketed by -18 to -2 mas / yr in ra and -12 to -1 mas / yr in dec . however , 27 per cent of the nonmembers are classified as members with these criteria .",
    "thus , stars classified as nonmembers by this method are very likely to be actual nonmembers , but those classified as members are less certain . using these proper motion data , we deleted an additional 60 stars , leaving 130 stars .",
    "next , we removed 7 stars listed as `` bm '' ( binary members ) in table 2 of paper i. as a final constraint on membership status , we also employed the photometric data provided in the ppmxl catalog .",
    "the catalog includes @xmath4 and @xmath5 magnitudes for all the stars in our working sample . from these",
    ", we plotted a @xmath4 versus @xmath6 color - magnitude diagram and removed giants and subgiants and a few other stars clearly offset from the nominal main sequence .",
    "these steps leave us with our final sample of 98 single main sequence m67 members .",
    "we calculated the uncertainties in the periods using the following procedure .",
    "first , in most cases we set the uncertainty equal to the standard deviation of the mean between the optimal and pdm - derived periods .",
    "we adopted a minimum value of 0.5 d. in those cases where the optimal period was multiplied by two ( see section 2.5 ) , the standard deviation is calculated from the adjusted optimal period and the pdm period .    since many of the stars in our sample fall outside the regions covered by recent photometric studies of m67 , they lack @xmath7 and @xmath8 determinations .",
    "cross - matching the stars in our final sample with the ninth data release of the extensive apass photometric catalog @xcite , we are able to obtain @xmath7 and @xmath8 values for only a subset of them . as a workaround ,",
    "we calibrated simple equations relating the @xmath4 and @xmath6 values to the available apass @xmath7 and @xmath8 values in order to calculate the later quantities from the former ; we used data from 61 stars in the m67 field to calibrate the equations .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 is calculated from an equation linear in @xmath4 and quadratic in @xmath6 ; @xmath8 is calculated from an equation quadratic in @xmath6 .",
    "the calibrations have a typical error of 0.11 magnitude , which is about double the typical uncertainty in the apass @xmath7 magnitude and the same as that of the @xmath8 magnitude .",
    "these calibrations give us @xmath7 magnitudes and @xmath8 colors for all the stars in our sample .",
    "although other sources of @xmath7 and @xmath8 photometry are available for many of these stars , we employ only the calculated photometry in this work to maintain homogeneity .",
    "the resulting extinction- and reddening - corrected color - magnitude diagram is shown in figure 1 .",
    "color excess is 0.041 magnitude @xcite .",
    "all the other stars from the original sample in the `` rot '' category are shown as plus signs.,width=336 ]    we list our period estimates for our final sample in table 1 and show their distribution on the sky in figure 2 .",
    "we show the period - color diagram in figure 3 .        .",
    "the error bars are also shown on the period values.,width=336 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , the results of the period analyses of both b16 and the present work imply a gyro - age greater than the solar age by about 1 gyr for the sun - like stars in m67 .",
    "this is more than 1 gyr older than the typical age implied by recent stellar evolution models for the cluster @xcite .",
    "it is not clear at this point how to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "there are probably sufficient uncertainties about the physics that goes into calculating stellar evolutionary models and the composition of the stars in m67 that an age near 5.4 gyr could be accommodated by them @xcite .",
    "in paper i we newly identified 32 solar analogs in m67 , which we listed in table 6 .",
    "we have identified a few more in the present work .",
    "the one most like the sun is epic 211378792 ; its magnitude and color are very similar to those of s770 , which has been identified as a solar twin .",
    "its period is 22.6 d , and its @xmath9 color is 0.69 .",
    "in addition , we can add epic 211390107 and epic 211398269 as solar analogs , with periods of 33.6 and 33.5 d , respectively .",
    "these two stars are located very close together on the color - magnitude diagram , which would explain why they have nearly identical periods .",
    "the fact that their periods are about 7 days longer than the solar rotation period could be accounted for by their slightly redder colors than the sun , with @xmath10 .",
    "using _ kepler / k2-campaign-5 _ light curves , we have performed an improved period analysis of m67 member stars compared to our earlier similar study ( paper i ) .",
    "we found that some of the period estimates in paper i were not true rotation periods .",
    "our new analysis includes stars observed by _",
    "kepler _ over a wider area than we explored in paper i , but , because of our more restrictive criteria in the present work , actually yields fewer rotation period determinations from the same data .",
    "in addition , we derived periods from a second _ k2 _ database containing detrended light curves .",
    "the new rotation periods are in excellent agreement with those of b16 , where our samples overlap .",
    "we determine the mean period for sun - like stars in m67 to be @xmath0 d , which implies a gyro - age of @xmath1 gyr .",
    "these results are similar to those b16 for their smaller sample of sun - like stars in the cluster .",
    "however , we obtain different gyro - ages for the cluster depending on which region of the main sequence we consider .",
    "progress in the study of rotation periods can be made by increasing the time baseline of _",
    "k2 _ observations of m67 , which would be possible if it is retargeted .",
    "ground - based observations can also be employed for those stars with larger amplitude variations .",
    "we thank the reviewer for very helpful suggestions . we acknowledge receipt of the updated dataset ( version : 6_004_1510 ) of the virgo experiment , on the cooperative esa / nasa mission soho from the virgo team through pmod / wrc , davos , switzerland .",
