    "the physical mechanisms considered when attempting to understand these environment trends all involve processes that effect the gas content of the galaxies , the fuel supply for star formation .",

    "these mechanisms effect the gas either by stimulating star formation ( which rapidly consumes the gas , locking it up in stars ) or by removing the gas from the galaxy ( and ionising it ) or by preventing further accretion . unlike the other mechanisms listed which quench star formation relatively quickly ( @xmath0@xmath4  years )",

    "one way to quantify the gas evolution in abell  370 is to compare the hi  density around the cluster with values from the literature .",
    "the hi  densities calculated for a variety of subsamples and volumes around abell  370 along with various literature values can be found in table  [ table_hi_density ] and can be seen plotted in fig .",
    "[ hi_density ] .",
    "the hi  density in a volume can be calculated using :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the hi  density , @xmath17 is the number of galaxies being considered , @xmath18 is the average hi  mass measured for these galaxies , and v is the volume in which these galaxies are contained .    the comoving volume containing all 324 abell  370 galaxies was calculated from the extent of the optical imaging ( see fig .",
    "[ exclusion_wfi_galaxies_all ] ) and the redshift range spanned by the galaxies .",
    "the total area on the sky of the optical imaging after accounting for the removal of the exclusion regions ( see fig .  [ exclusion_wfi_galaxies_all ] ) is 0.776  deg@xmath19 .",
    "not all this area has uniform optical sampling which may cause a slight underestimate of the hi  densities measured .",
    "taking into account the limits placed by the gmrt 10  per  cent beam level , the area on the sky containing the galaxies with hi  measurements is 0.668 deg@xmath19 .",
    "the hi  frequency range of the gmrt observations spans from z  =  0.345 to 0.387 . using these values ,",
    "the total comoving volume of the abell  370 hi  measurements is 62300  mpc@xmath20 .",
    "the volume is much longer in the redshift direction than in projected distance on the sky ( at most @xmath015  mpc across compared to 148  mpc deep ) .    using this volume ,",
    "a hi  density of @xmath21 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 is found using all 324 abell  370 galaxies . the hi  density in this volume due to just the 105 blue galaxies is @xmath23 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 .",
    "this almost equals the density calculated for all the galaxies , indicating that most of the hi  gas around the cluster is located in the blue galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the hi  density due to just the 219 red galaxies is @xmath24 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 .",
    "the blue and red galaxy values do not sum exactly to give the hi  density from all galaxies due to the weighting schemes used when measuring the hi  gas .",
    "the hi  density measured using only the 168 [ oii ] emission galaxies is @xmath25 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 .",
    "this is similar to that found for the blue galaxies , which shows that this sample also selects the majority of the hi  gas in galaxies within this volume .",
    "the hi  density measurements listed above only include the hi  gas contained in the known abell  370 galaxies ; they do not take into account the many ` missing ' , optically fainter galaxies in the volume that may contain hi  gas .",
    "as such these measurement are only lower limits on the total hi  density in the volume .",
    "these previous measured values have been scaled up to an estimate of the total hi  density in the volume .",
    "this is done by assuming that the optical luminosity density of the galaxies is proportional to their hi  density . the optical luminosity density in the @xmath26  band for the galaxies in each abell  370 galaxy sample",
    "was measured . for each of the galaxy samples a schechter function fit using @xmath27 minimisation was made to their magnitude distribution . in this function fitting ,",
    "the faint end slope of the luminosity function , @xmath28 , was set at @xmath29 because the abell  370 @xmath26  band magnitudes do not extend faint enough to allow an accurate determination of this parameter .",
    "this @xmath28 value is based on literature results for hi  galaxies in hipass @xcite and optical cluster galaxies in the 2dfgrs @xcite .",
    "the fitted schechter functions were integrated over all magnitudes to create an estimate of the total optical luminosity density of the galaxies . the hi  density for each galaxy sample",
    "was then scaled up by the ratio of this total optical luminosity density to the optical luminosity density measured from just the galaxies in the sample .",
    "these total hi  density estimates are the extrapolated values listed in table  [ table_hi_density ] and are shown in fig .",
    "[ hi_density ] .",
    "the value of this ratio is listed in brackets in the table , next to the sample name .",

    "the galaxies in this inner subsample span a projected distance on the sky of r@xmath9= 2.57  mpc from the cluster centre and a redshift range of z  =  0.357 to 0.387 , a cosmological distance of 106  mpc . however , these galaxies close to the cluster core have large peculiar motions .",
    "as such the majority of these galaxies are likely to span a much smaller distance in the redshift direction than that indicated by this direct cosmological distance conversion . a reasonable assumed distance that the majority of the inner galaxies would span in the redshift direction would be 2.57  mpc , i.e.  similiar to the galaxies projected distance on the sky .",
    "this is the physical volume spanned by the galaxies which should remain unchanged with time in this gravitationally bound region . using this value ,",
    "the volume probed is 71  mpc@xmath20 , which makes the hi  density in this region @xmath30 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 .",
    "the hi  density measured for the inner subsample is substantially greater ( more than 50 times higher ) than even the extrapolated hi  densities measured for the other galaxy samples in abell  370 .",
    "even though the galaxies in the cluster core may have lower hi  gas content than similar galaxies in the field , they are packed into a very small volume , dramatically raising the hi  density measured there . galaxies in field environments may have more hi  gas per galaxy but they are spread over larger volumes reducing the hi  density found there .        in order to make a comparison with the nearby galaxy cluster of coma , a sample of galaxies within 8  mpc of the cluster centre of abell  370 was selected .",
    "[ radius_vs_redshift ] shows the redshifts of the abell  370 galaxies plotted against their projected distance from the cluster centre .",
    "galaxies close to the cluster core have larger peculiar velocities than those further out . using this fact ,",

    "[ radius_vs_redshift ] .",
    "these galaxies are assumed to all lie within the 8  mpc radius sphere centred on the cluster core with physical volume 2140  mpc@xmath20 ( again the volume spanned by these galaxies should remain relatively unchanged with time in this gravitationally bound region ) .",
    "the average hi  mass measured for these galaxies is listed in table  [ hi_mass_measurments ] , as is the values for the subsample of 58 blue galaxies within this selection .",
    "using the large smoothing average hi  mass measurement of all 220 galaxies , a hi  density of @xmath31  m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 is found ( this is the value plotted in fig .  [ hi_density ] and",

    "a hi  density of @xmath32  m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 is found , which has substantially higher signal to noise .",
    "if one considers only the 58 blue galaxies in this region , using their average hi  mass large smoothing measurement , a hi  density of @xmath33  m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 is found .",
    "this is comparable to that measured for all 220 galaxies in the selection 8  mpc radius region which suggests that again it is the blue galaxies that contain the majority of the hi  gas within this volume .",
    "the first set of literature values listed in table  [ table_hi_density ] are hi  gas cosmic density values at a variety of redshifts .",
    "these values were all converted to the hi  densities ; some were published as neutral gas densities and included a correction for the neutral helium content .",
    "the first value listed is the z  =  0 cosmic hi  density as measured in the hipass survey @xcite using hi  21-cm emission from a large sample of galaxies across the entire southern sky .",
    "the second value is the hi  density measured in a sample of star - forming galaxies at z  =  0.24 using coadded hi  21-cm emission @xcite .",
    "the other two values are from damped ly@xmath28  measurements , looking at the hi  absorption in quasar spectra in the rest - frame ultraviolet .",

    "the z  @xmath0  3.7 ( redshift range z  =  3.5 to 4.0 ) value has been measured from optical spectra of quasars primarily from the sloan digital sky survey ( the ly@xmath28  absorption is redshifted into the optical at these redshifts ) @xcite .",
    "the listed cosmic hi  density values beyond redshift z  =  0 are similar .",
    "they are all around @xmath34 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 , which is twice the hi  density at z  =  0 .",
    "the z  =  0.24 and z  @xmath0  0.6 value are the cosmic density measurements which are closest in redshift to abell  370 at z  =  0.37 .",
    "they are plotted with the z  =  0 in the top part of fig .",
    "[ hi_density ] .",
    "the z  @xmath0  3.7 value is the highest hi  cosmic density value as currently measured . the hi  density measured in the larger volume samples of abell  370 galaxies are slightly less than the hi  cosmic density found at z  =  0 ( see the top part of fig .  [ hi_density ] ) .",
    "however the extrapolated hi  density values are comparable to the hi  cosmic density found at z  =  0.24 and z  @xmath0  0.6 .",
    "the errors in these measurements make it difficult to determine if there has been any substantial evolution in the hi  gas in galaxies from these values .",
    "indeed it is probably not fair to compare the hi  density found in this large volume around abell  370 to the cosmic density as we are dealing with an unusual volume of the universe with a considerably higher galaxy density than the average .",
    "additionally the extrapolation used to scale up the hi  gas density is highly uncertain particularly in the inner regions of the cluster where the high galaxy density would probably effect the smaller galaxies gas content more significantly than the larger galaxies . to do a fair test for evolution",
    "it is necessary to compare the measured hi  density around abell  370 to nearby volumes with similarly high galaxy densities .",
    "the second set of literature values listed in table  [ table_hi_density ] are derived from hi  density values for three nearby galaxy clusters .",

    "this measurement is a lower limit as it does not include a correction for any missing galaxies .",
    "however it is likely to be close to the total hi  density as it contains the majority of the galaxies with significant hi  gas content .",

    "was measured .",
    "galaxies were included in this volume if they lay with the 2.5  mpc projected distance of the sky of the cluster centre and had redshifts between 4000  kms@xmath37  and 9000  kms@xmath37 .",
    "there are 36 galaxies with hi  measurements not contaminated by rfi in this region which gives a hi  density of @xmath38  m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 .",

    "the hi  density was measured around the coma cluster centre out to a radius of 2.5  mpc and 8  mpc . a radius of 8  mpc is the maximum projected distance from the coma cluster with good observations ( there were insufficient hi  observations to make similar 8  mpc measurements for abell  1367 and the virgo cluster ) . the inner 2.5  mpc radius region of the coma cluster has a hi  density of @xmath41 m@xmath2mpc@xmath22 from 22 hi  galaxies .",

    "this trend is seen for the abell  370 galaxies when comparing the inner and outer subsamples ( see section  [ the_inner_and_outer_cluster_subsamples ] ) .",
    "rather this high hi  density value found in the inner regions of abell  370 compared to nearby clusters is an indication that there has been substantial evolution in the gas content of galaxies in clusters over the last @xmath04  billion years since z  =  0.37 .",
    "similarly , the region within 8  mpc of the centre of abell  370 has a hi  density that is @xmath08  times higher than the similar size region around coma .",

    "must ensure that there is no significant biases on the measurements that could be distorting the result .",
    "the coma hi  gas measurements come from targeted observations rather than a blind hi  search of the cluster . as such",
    "it is not impossible that an appreciable fraction of the hi  gas in galaxies within the cluster has been missed .",
    "this is unlikely though , as all the optically bright late - type galaxies have been observed and these are likely to be the dominate contributors to the hi  density . even if including the missing low hi  mass galaxies raises the hi  density in coma by a factor of two there is still considerably more gas found around abell  370 .",
    "the unaccounted for gas due to these smaller galaxies is unlikely to be anywhere near as substantially as this particular as these galaxies with lower total galaxy masses will have a harder time holding onto their gas against the high density environmental mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping .",
    "additionally it is likely that appreciable amounts of the hi  gas is missing in the abell  370 volumes due to the relatively bright optical magnitude limit of this galaxy sample .",
    "the optical imaging of abell  370 does not extend fully out to a projected radius of 8  mpc in all directions as seen in fig .",
    "[ a370_radius_mpc ] .",
    "this will result in missing some galaxies within this volume causing a small underestimation of the hi  density in this volume . to select the coma and virgo galaxies the distances in the goldmine database",
    "were used .",
    "these distances have had the effect of the peculiar velocities of the galaxies removed , allowing one to select the galaxies close to the cluster centres .",
    "if these distances are incorrect for a large number of galaxies , then this could result in an underestimation of the true hi  densities in these clusters .",
    "however , this is unlikely as the distances appear quite reasonable based on their redshift and spatial distribution on the sky .",
    "the literature values for the clusters included hi  flux upper limits for a number of galaxies .",
    "these galaxies were considered to have no gas when doing the density calculations .",
    "they are unlikely to contain sufficient gas to significantly effect the results .",
    "ideally one would want deep hi  blind observations of a number of large galaxy cluster at low redshift to compare with the abell  370 observations .",
    "such published data do not exist as yet .",
    "due to the uncertainties on the current galaxy samples of both abell  370 and the low redshift clusters it is difficult to say with precision the amount of difference in the hi  densities .",
    "however , from the measurements it is clear that abell  370 has considerably more gas than local clusters suggesting there has been substantial evolution in the gas content in clusters over the last 4  billion years .",
    "the hi  density of abell  370 is markedly larger than that found in the coma cluster in the regions considered .",
    "the hi  gas density in abell  370 is up to 8 times higher than in coma .",
    "the increase in the cosmic hi  density from z  =  0 to the largest known values at higher redshifts is at most a factor of two ( see table  [ table_hi_density ] ) .",
    "if abell  370 were to evolve into a gas poor system like coma in @xmath04  billion years , then the rate of decrease in the gas would be considerably faster than the rate of decrease seen in the field .",
    "this higher rate of decrease in gas content could be caused by the combination of the higher rate of galaxy - galaxy interactions in the cluster environment and the interactions between the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxies with the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) of the cluster which is denser than the igm of the field .",
    "comparing the hi  measurements of the galaxies in abell  370 directly with local samples is difficult , primarily due to the unusual way in which the abell  370 measurements were made , i.e.  by coadding the hi  21-cm emission signal from multiple galaxies .",
    "one way of doing this comparison is to make similar coadded average hi  mass measurements in nearby clusters using literature hi  21-cm emission values . to do",
    "this one needs a complete sample of the optical galaxies in a nearby cluster down to the magnitude limits of the abell  370 galaxy sample .",
    "additionally one needs to know the hi  mass for each of these optical galaxies .",

    "the weak radio continuum observed in normal galaxies is emitted by an ensemble of relativistic electrons that are produced in supernova remnants .",
    "lifetimes of these relativistic particles can exceed the timescale associated with star bursts .",

    "one question that has not been answered is why abell  370 has such a large hi  gas content compared to nearby galaxy clusters . in order to produce the mass in stars seen in galaxies it is necessary for there to be replenishment of the hi  gas to fuel sufficient star formation @xcite .",
    "this replenishment must come from ionised hydrogen ( hii  gas ) around the galaxy becoming sufficiently dense and cool to condense into hi  gas which can then fuel star formation in a galaxy . at some point this process stops in clusters so that they evolve into the hi  poor systems that are seen today",
    "there are two possible models to explain this decrease in hii  condensation : the ` reservoir ' model and the ` accretion ' model .    in the ` reservoir ' model",
    "there is an envelope of ionised gas surrounding a galaxy that can fall onto the galaxy over time and condense into hi  gas .",
    "a galaxy would slowly use up the ionised gas component of this envelope that could condense to hi  gas which would eventually halt star formation in that galaxy .",
    "interactions in higher galaxy density regions would cause galaxies to use up this envelop faster by either driving this gas into the galaxies to condense faster or remove it from the halo of the galaxies entirely ( i.e.  strangulation ) .    in the ` accretion '",
    "model ionised gas moves from the inter - galactic medium onto a galaxy where it reaches sufficient density to condense into hi  gas .",
    "this accreted ionised gas would not have initially been gravitationally bound to the galaxy unlike the ionised gas in the ` reservoir ' model .",
    "the expansion of the universe with time would slow the rate at which this inter - galactic ionised gas can fall onto galaxies , reducing the production of hi  gas and hence the rate of star formation in the galaxies .",
    "the rate of gas replenishment in this mechanism will be proportional to the density of the inter - galactic material which will be inversely proportional to the physical volume size of an element of comoving volume ( the change in the size of universe ) . at z  =  0.37",
    ", the redshift of abell  370 , a comoving volume element of the universe would have a physical volume that is @xmath040  per  cent its current size , a significant difference .",
    "once the expansion of the universe has caused this gas accretion to drop to a low level , the rate of interactions in high galaxy density environments would quickly use up hi  gas in the galaxies creating the hi  gas poor clusters we see today .",
    "galaxies in lower density regions with slow star formation rates would be able to retain their existing hi  gas for longer .    distinguishing between these two models is not easy as both involve ionised hii  gas which is notoriously hard to measure .",
