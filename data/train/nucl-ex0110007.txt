    ", the central force described by the harmonic oscillator had been unable to explain magic numbers except for 2 , 8 , and 20 .",
    "the @xmath22-force clearly explained not only the magic numbers but also many prominent nuclear properties .",
    "the @xmath22-splitting of single nucleon states is as large as that of the major shell spacing and plays an essential role in nuclear physics .    as for @xmath21-nucleus interactions in @xmath21-hypernuclei , the observation of @xmath21 single particle states , first by the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reaction @xcite and then later by the ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) reaction @xcite , clarified the gross structure of the interactions .",
    "the central force was found to be roughly 2/3 of that of a nucleon . in the naive quark model a @xmath21 particle",
    "is composed of u , d , and s quarks and the s ( strange ) quark is considered to contribute little to the nuclear force . in the one boson exchange ( obe )",
    "model it is understood that the absence of the long - range one pion exchange contribution makes the central force smaller . on the other hand ,",
    "spin - dependent forces are not well known .",
    "especially , the @xmath22-force in a @xmath21-nucleus is considered to be much smaller than that in a nucleon - nucleus , although no experiment has given a conclusive value .",
    "measurement of the @xmath21-nucleus @xmath22-splitting has been one of major objects in the study of hypernuclei for more than two decades .",
    "this paper is a follow - up to our recently - published paper @xcite which was confined to the derivation of the @xmath22-splitting . in this paper , details of the experiment and analysis",
    "are provided and spectroscopic results for the @xmath0c hypernucleus are discussed .",
    "the first indication of a small @xmath21-nucleus @xmath22-splitting was given by the study of the @xmath25o(@xmath3 , @xmath4)@xmath26o reaction at the cern proton synchrotron ( ps )  @xcite in 1978 .",
    "they observed peaks with major configurations of [ ( @xmath17)@xmath27(@xmath17)@xmath18]@xmath29 and [ ( @xmath30)@xmath27(@xmath30)@xmath18]@xmath29 . the splitting of the two peaks was about 6 mev which is quite close to 6.18 mev corresponding to a splitting between the ( @xmath17)@xmath27 and ( @xmath30)@xmath27 states in @xmath31o ( core nucleus of @xmath26o ) .",

    ". gave an upper limit of 0.3 mev for the @xmath22-splitting .",
    "however a detailed theoretical analysis gave 0.8@xmath130.7 mev for the splitting @xcite .",
    "consequently the constraint on the splitting was weakened .",
    "later may @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "measured an energy shift of a peak at e@xmath3510.4 mev between 0@xmath36 and 15@xmath36 by the @xmath2c(@xmath3 , @xmath4)@xmath0c reaction at the ags of bnl @xcite .",

    "they obtained 0.36@xmath130.3 mev for the splitting of the 1/2@xmath5 and 3/2@xmath5 states in @xmath0c .",
    "another study was the observation of @xmath1 rays from @xmath39be excited by the @xmath40be(@xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reaction by using nai detectors @xcite .",
    "a peak was observed at 3.079@xmath130.040 mev in the @xmath1 ray spectrum and the peak was considered to be due to @xmath1 rays from unresolved 3/2@xmath8 and 5/2@xmath8 states , which have a configuration of [ @xmath41be(2@xmath8 ) @xmath9 ( @xmath42)@xmath18 ] , to the ground state ( gs ) in @xmath39be .",
    "the width of the peak suggested that the splitting was less than 0.1 mev , although the possibility that @xmath1 rays from either state were missing was not completely excluded .",

    "interactions between baryons have been studied by the meson exchange theory combined with phenomenology .",
    "the obe model of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath52 ) interaction was extended to the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath19 ) interaction with the help of flavor su(3 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "effective one - body hyperon - nucleus interactions were constructed based on the obe models @xcite .",
    "they well reproduce the central part of the @xmath21-nucleus interaction and predict a weak @xmath21-nucleus @xmath22-force .",

    "a new experiment with a precision of better than 0.1 mev for the @xmath56-splitting was needed to distinguish the models .",

    "the two states are the partners of the @xmath22-doublet states .",
    "by virtue of the 0@xmath8 spin of the @xmath6c core , the energy difference between the states gives the @xmath22-splitting of a @xmath21 particle in the @xmath44-orbit .",

    "is necessary . in order to improve the energy resolution , we measured @xmath1 rays from the 1/2@xmath5 and 3/2@xmath5 states at e@xmath3511 mev to the gs in @xmath0c by using nai detectors .",
    "the energy resolution of the nai detectors was about 0.35 mev ( fwhm ) for the detection of 11 mev @xmath1 rays .",
    "it was good enough for the measurement of the @xmath22-splitting with a precision of better than 0.1 mev given enough statistics . if the splitting is larger than or close to the energy resolution of the nai detectors , one should observe two peaks , or a peak clearly broader than the energy resolution , from which one can derive the splitting easily .",
    "even if the splitting is much less than the energy resolution , the splitting can be derived as follows .",
    "the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reaction at forward angles is a unique way to selectively excite the 1/2@xmath5 state in @xmath0c via the @xmath60=0 transition . the so - called substitutional transition ( ( @xmath17)@xmath61 @xmath58 ( @xmath17)@xmath18 ) is dominant at momentum transfers much smaller than the fermi momentum . on the other hand the 3/2@xmath5 state",

    "based on these considerations we designed an experiment to measure @xmath1 rays from the 1/2@xmath5 and 3/2@xmath5 states which were excited by the @xmath2c(@xmath3 , @xmath4)@xmath0c reaction @xcite .",

    "the @xmath3 beam momentum was 0.93 gev / c , or close to 0.9 gev / c at the target center after energy loss , in order to maximize the production rate of the 1/2@xmath5 and 3/2@xmath5 states in @xmath0c .",

    "as explained in sec.[sec : level6 ] , the angular distributions of the @xmath2c(@xmath3 , @xmath4)@xmath0c reaction selectively excite either the 1/2@xmath5 or 3/2@xmath5 states even if the states are not separated in the energy spectrum of @xmath1 rays .",

    "but an inconsistency of about a factor of 2 remained .",
    "the theoretical differential cross section of the 1/2@xmath5 state at the forward angles is especially sensitive to the @xmath3 beam momentum of around 0.9 gev / c .",
    "for example , the differential cross section is expected to decrease by a factor of 3 at 1.0 gev / c @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility that a small ambiguity of the @xmath3 beam momentum in previous ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) experiments , on which differential cross sections were adjusted theoretically , might produce such a large inconsistency at the forward angles .",
    "if it is a cause of the inconsistency , the systematic error would be much smaller .",
    "several fittings with different functions , such as 2 gaussians and a linear background , and widths were applied to study how the choice of functions can influence the splitting , and a systematic error originating from choosing different fitting functions was estimated to be 19 kev at most .",
    "the influence of the doppler shift correction was also studied by using the geant simulator , and it was found to be negligible because the nai detectors installed symmetrically in the vertical direction almost canceled it .",
    "the energy calibration of the nai detectors affects the splitting very little because @xmath1 rays from both the states were measured simultaneously .",
    "the total systematic error of the splitting was estimated to be 36 kev .",
    "the final result of the splitting was determined to be @xmath11e(1/2@xmath123/2@xmath5 ) = + 152@xmath1354(stat)@xmath1336(syst ) kev .",
    "the @xmath22-splitting of a nucleon in the @xmath44-orbit around this mass region is 3@xmath145 mev , thus the @xmath22-splitting of a @xmath21 particle in the @xmath44-orbit is about 20@xmath1430 times smaller .",
    "after the final energy calibration explained in the end of sec.[sec : level8 ] , the excitation energies of the 1/2@xmath5 and 3/2@xmath5 states were obtained as 10.982@xmath130.031(stat)@xmath130.056(syst ) mev and 10.830@xmath130.031(stat)@xmath130.056(syst ) mev , respectively .",

    "the present measurement is consistent with a @xmath1 ray energy of 10.95@xmath130.1(stat)@xmath130.2(syst ) mev in ref.@xcite .",

    "the @xmath55 force of the obe models decreased the splitting of @xmath0c by only 20@xmath1430 % @xcite .",

    "these calculations systematically show that the @xmath19 interaction given by the obe models predicts larger @xmath22-splittings than the present measurement .",
    "the state - of - the - art calculation of the @xmath19 interaction based on the obe models is unable to reproduce the present result . on the other hand , in a calculation of the strength of the one - body @xmath22-force starting from a quark - based @xmath19 interaction , the strength of the @xmath55 force amounted to approximately 85 % of that of the @xmath22-force @xcite .",
    "a calculation using a large @xmath55 force based on the quark model gave about 0.2 mev for the splitting of @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "the difference between these results was mainly due to different strengths of the @xmath55 force .",
    "since the splitting for @xmath0c is very small , forces besides the @xmath22-force may also contribute to the splitting .",
    "it has been pointed out by millener that a tensor force makes a significant contribution to the splitting of @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "the nuclear @xmath22-force mixes a small s=1 component into the @xmath6c core wave function , and other forces arise from the s=1 component .",
    "his prediction for the splitting of @xmath0c was 107 kev , where the spin - spin force ( + 42 kev ) , the @xmath22-force ( + 280 kev ) , and the tensor force ( @xmath69215 kev ) were considered .",
    "the result almost reproduces the present measurement .",
    "a systematic study of light @xmath21-hypernuclei shows that the @xmath19 interactions based on the obe model need to be modified so that a smaller @xmath22-splitting , which has been indicated by the present experiment , can be accommodated @xcite .",
