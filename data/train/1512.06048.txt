    "all the efforts spent to develop a self - consistent theory of quantum gravity have been so far incomplete @xcite .",
    "even though many approaches have been carried forward during the last few decades , the problem of obtaining a covariant scheme for quantum gravity still remains open and , consequently , many phenomenological proposals have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "an appealing technique consists in assuming the violation of the lorentz invariance at some particular energy regimes @xcite .",
    "the idea is that lorentz invariance is somehow broken at ultraviolet scales , providing quantum effects which have consequences on the observable universe itself .",
    "recently , following this philosophy ho@xmath1ava proposed an alternative theory which reduces to einstein s gravity with a cosmological constant in the infrared regime , leading to complicated modifications at the ultraviolet regime @xcite .",
    "the underlying philosophy of hoava s model is to include lorentz breaking terms in the action which provides a different scaling between space and time at a ultraviolet fixed point . the transformation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scaling exponent , in the case @xmath4 , leads to a theory which is renormalizable by power counting",
    "this idea was first proposed by lifshitz @xcite and , in the case of the hoava approach , it leads to a model which is non - relativistic in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "however , in the infrared limit , the model manifests an emerging 4-dimensional general covariance . due to these considerations ,",
    "the ho@xmath1ava framework is frequently referred to as the ho@xmath1ava - lifshitz ( hl ) model .",
    "although the model is clearly appealing to describe quantum effects in gravity , its physical interpretation is still open .",
    "for instance , the model depends upon several parameters , each of them having a precise physical role .",
    "nevertheless , the interpretation of those parameters is not completely known . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the parameter @xmath0 which is usually fixed in the infrared limit in order to obtain einstein s gravity .    in this work",
    ", we will consider homogeneous spacetimes with a perfect fluid as the gravitational source under the condition that they satisfy the field equations of the hoava - lifshitz model .",
    "in particular , we will explicitly analyze the isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime and the anisotropic bianchi cosmologies of the type i , v and ix , following the procedure formulated in @xcite .",
    "we first derive the field equations and write them in a form which is suitable for our analysis . in particular , we express the hamiltonian constraint in terms of the hubble parameters which determine the expansion in different spatial directions .",
    "then , we assume the validity of the cardy entropy which was originally derived in 2-dimensional conformal field theory . assuming the validity of the cardy formula implies that we are assuming a holographic treatment of the entropy in the hl model .",
    "if this assumption turns out to be true in the corresponding cosmological scenarios , we can conclude that the holographic principle can be used in the corresponding models .",
    "in fact , we will show that for all homogeneous spacetimes under consideration in this work it is possible to define the central charge and the eigenvalue of the virasoro operator in such a way that the cardy formula is identically satisfied , generating an explicit expression for the cardy entropy . in doing so",
    ", it turns out that the hoava parameter @xmath0 enters explicitly the cardy entropy , allowing us to interpret is determining the entropy and the gravitational interaction of the theory .",
    "moreover , we will calculate the hubble , bekenstein and bekenstein - hawking for the anisotropic bianchi ix cosmological model , and will show that they can be arranged in such a way that the corresponding hamiltonian constraint can be cast into the pythagorean representation proposed recently by verlinde @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hor ] , we present a brief review of the hoava action and comment on the free parameters that enter the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosm ] , we study homogeneous spacetimes with a perfec - fluid source .",
    "we consider the flrw metric and the bianchi i , v and ix metrics for which we derive the field equations explicitly .",
    "special attention is given to the form of the hamiltonian constraint which is expressed in a compact form in terms of the scale factors , the hubble parameters and the parameters entering the hl model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cve ] , we analyze the hamiltonian constraints of all the homogeneous cosmological spacetimes and establish a unique relationship that allows us to define the cardy entropy for each spacetime .",
    "we also show that the pythagorean representation of the constraints in terms of entropies is valid in the hl model . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] , we discuss our results .",
    "consider an arbitrary 4-dimensional metric in the framework of the adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) formalism , i.e. , @xmath5 where we introduced the lapse function @xmath6 , the shift vector @xmath7 and the 3-dimensional metric @xmath8 .",
    "the einstein - hilbert covariant action in the adm - decomposition is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the extrinsic curvature tensor and @xmath11 its trace , where the dot represents the time derivative .",
    "the hl quantum gravity model is based upon a generalization of the einstein - hilbert action which breaks covariance in order to obtain in the ultraviolet limit a theory that is renormalizable by power counting .",
    "then , the hoava action can be expressed as @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature for the 3-dimensional metric @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath17 is known in literature as the cotton tensor .",
    "the free parameters entering the hoava action ( @xmath18 ) are : @xmath0 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "soon after the publication of the model , it was found that the schwarzschild - ads black hole solution is not recovered in the infrared limit , although einstein s theory with cosmological model was obtained at the level of the action @xcite .",
    "this difficulty was solved by introducing an additional parameter which modifies the ir behavior @xcite . in this work , however , we will use the original hoava action since our results do not depend on the value of the additional parameter .",
    "the five constants @xmath19 , @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 are parameters which determine the velocity of the light @xmath24 , the gravitational constant @xmath25 and the einstein cosmological constant @xmath26 by means of @xcite @xmath27 these three constraints imply that three constants of the hl model can be fixed by using experimental data . notice that for @xmath28 the gravitational constant becomes negative , indicating the presence of repulsive gravity .",
    "we therefore limit ourselves to the case @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , the hl model possesses only two free parameters which should be chosen in accordance with observations . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the investigation of the physical significance of the parameter @xmath0 in the context of cosmological models .",
    "the simplest cosmological models assume a high degree of symmetry in order to be able to handle the corresponding field equations . in this section",
    ", we will assume that the spacetime is homogeneous so that we are left with only two possible classes of models , namely , isotropic and anisotropic cosmological models .",
    "in the first case , the geometry of the spacetime is described by the flrw metric @xmath30\\ , \\label{flrw}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the scale factor and @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding field equations can be derived from the variation of the hoava action .",
    "we obtain @xmath33\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath34\\,,\\ ] ] where the total density and pressure are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the limiting case of the @xmath26cdm model",
    "is recovered when @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    for later use",
    ", it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian constraint ( @xmath41 ) as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a function of the scale factor and the ho@xmath1ava parameters .",
    "the explicit value of this function depends on the topology of the cosmological model and can be expressed as given in table [ table1 ] .",
