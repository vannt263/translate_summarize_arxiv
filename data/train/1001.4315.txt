    "recent observations reveal that outflows are important in the lifecycle of galaxies .",
    "first , @xcite find evidence for chemical enrichment trends throughout star - forming galaxies over three orders of magnitude in stellar mass .",
    "surprisingly , the enrichment trends are observed to continue all the way down to @xmath3 @xcite where @xmath4 is the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , there is evidence that galaxies that exceed the mass of the milky way manage to retain a large fraction of their metals , in contrast to lower mass galaxies where metal loss appears to be anticorrelated with baryonic mass .",
    "recent theoretical work has shown that a low - metal content in dwarf galaxies is attributable to efficient metal - enriched outflows @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is now strong evidence for large - scale outflows in the galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "finally , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at all redshifts shows signs of significant metal enrichment consistent with the action of winds @xcite . a high proportion of lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 show kinematic signatures of winds @xcite as do many nearby dwarf starbursts @xcite and ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations of galaxy formation within cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology fail to produce realistic galactic disks @xcite .",
    "over - cooling in cdm+hydrodynamic simulations , due primarily to a lack of resolution , results in too much gas arriving in the centre of the galaxies . but a useful aspect of these incomplete models has been to highlight the possible role of feedback in shaping galaxies . vigorous feedback in the early phase of galaxy formation is a partial solution to the angular momentum problem by preventing baryons from losing too much of their specific angular momentum through the interaction with dark matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , some authors have claimed more realistic disks retaining much more of their angular momentum when one includes the action of agn - driven jets @xcite or starburst driven winds @xcite .",
    "our new survey is preempted by a vast literature across a broad spectrum that can be traced back over two decades @xmath6 comprehensive reviews are given by heckman_etal .",

    "much of the early optical work on galactic outflows was limited to narrowband images and long - slit spectroscopy ( e.g.mccarthy_etal . _  ( 1987 ) ; @xcite ; phillips ( 1993 ) ; lehnert & heckman ( 1996 ) ) although fabry - perot observations have been carried out in a few emission lines ( e.g.  bland & tully ( 1988 ) ; cecil ( 1990 ) ) .",
    "the quality of uv , x - ray , infrared and radio continuum observations has greatly improved in recent years ( e.g.  hoopes_etal._2005 ; strickland_etal . _  2004 ; @xcite ) . even without the kinematic separation of compound emission structures that is possible via spectroscopy",
    ", there are clear associations between these bands and the optical maps ( e.g.  veilleux_etal . _  1994 ; cecil_etal . _  2002 ) .",
    "historically , most winds had been confirmed kinematically from evidence of line - splitting along the galaxy minor axis , but at least one wind has been discovered through its ionisation signature @xcite . in recent times measurement of blueshifted absorption lines",
    "have proved powerful in this regard .    in this new study",
    ", we perform wide field integral field spectroscopy of a sample of nearby galactic winds .",
    "the advantages offered by a wide wavelength base line and moderate spectral resolutions allow the determination of physical parameters for wind outflow mechanics based on ionisation and kinematic signatures e.g.  rotating disk , high - latitude warm ionizing medium , wind filaments , entrained gas .",
    "one well - studied object in particular convinced us of the potential for wide - field mapping with an integral field spectrograph .",
    "the projected distribution of optical line emission in m82 is exceedingly complex but with the aid of fabry - perot observations , shopbell & bland - hawthorn ( 1998 ) were able to kinematically separate the front side from the back side of the wind flow , and from the diffuse halo of broadened line emission ( see also the recent ifs studies of @xcite ) .",
    "when this is done , both the ionisation and kinematics exhibit well ordered behavior .",
    "the lesson is clear : with complete observations , it is possible to separate distinct dynamical components",
    ". only then does it become possible to determine physical parameters for the outflow mechanism .    in this first paper , we present the new observations and describe the reduction procedures specific to integral field spectroscopy (  [ obsred ] ) .",
    "we present emission - line flux and line ratio maps for a wide range of diagnostics ( e.g.  ionisation and density ) . for each galaxy",
    ", we use the ionisation diagnostic diagrams ( idds ) to delineate the different sources of ionisation as a function of location and ionisation source ( see  [ the galaxy sample ] ) and classify the sample targets according to their individual idds (  [ starbursts ] - starbursts &  [ agn ] - agn ) .",
    "these diagnostic diagrams reveal well - ordered behavior across each galaxy . in  [ agn sf discussion ]",
    "we consider the source of ionisation from a theoretical perspective and use these considerations to construct an evolutionary sequence for galactic winds in section  [ events ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented  [ discussion ] .    through this work , we assume a flat concordance cosmology such that h@xmath7=71kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9=0.27 and @xmath10=0.73 .",
    "the aaomega integral - field spectrograph at the aat 3.9 m is ideally suited to our study ( see appendix ) .",
    "the spiral integral field unit ( ifu ) is a 32@xmath1116 element rectangular microlens array coupled via an optical fibre feed to the dual beam aaomega spectrograph @xcite .",
    "mounted at the cassegrain auxilliary focus , the 0.7  ifu pixel scale is well matched to the typical seeing at the aat , and gives excellent sensitivity to extended low surface brightness features .",
    "the single pointing field - of - view is 22.4@xmath1111.2 . high accuracy ,",
    "guide - probe offset guiding allows simple and reliable mosaicing of large areas .",
    "the default position angle of the ifu places the long axis in an east - west direction .",
    "observations of a number of targets were undertaken at alternate pas to accommodate the demands of other observing programs undertaken alongside the observations reported here .",
    "observations were undertaken over a number of observing runs as detailed in table  [ obs runs ] .",
    "the dual beam aaomega spectrograph provides excellent coverage of the spectral features of interest , while maintaining a high spectral resolution .",
    "we observe with the 1500v and 1000r volume phase holographic ( vph ) gratings in the blue and red arms respectively .",
    "we use a 5700  dichroic beam splitter and center the wavelength coverage and vph blazes at 5000  and 6800 , resulting in 2.4 pixel mid - range resolution elements of r@xmath126300 and r@xmath125600 ( velocity resolutions of @xmath13 35 and @xmath1350 km s@xmath8 fwhm ) . on accounting for the sample redshift range , this targets the emission lines h@xmath0/[oiii ]  in the blue and [ oi]/h@xmath1/[nii]/[sii ]  in the red .",
    "unfortunately the important [ oii ]  doublet at 3727  falls outside of the observable spectral range with the chosen settings .",
    "we consider this to be a crucial line for future studies of this kind .",
    "quartz - halogen flatfield exposures and cuar@xmath14fear arc lamp exposures are taken at intervals throughout the observation to allow fibre tracing on the ccds ( both arms of aaomega use e2v 2k@xmath114k ccds ) , flat fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "stationed in the west coud room , aaomega is kept thermally and gravitationally stable throughout each night s observations in order to minimize the overhead on system calibrations .",
    "the strong night sky oxygen line at 5577  falls outside the observed range and so can not be used to calibrate relative fibre transmission as is the common practice in low resolution multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "therefore twilight flatfield frames are observed in order to account for relative fibre - to - fibre transmission variations .",
    "an assortment of spectrophotometric standard stars were observed throughout each observing block , in order to prepare a flux calibration solution .",
    "the scatter in the calibration function derived from the standards during the observations indicates a 10% uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration level . the relative calibration with wavelength , a quantity more relevant to line ratio determinations , is consistent at the @xmath122 - 3% level , as determined from the comparison of calibration observations over the course of the survey .",
    "each target was observed as part of a multi - pointing mosaic .",
    "an overlap of 1 or 2 ifu elements ( 0.7  or 1.4 ) was allowed to enable relative intensity scaling and accurate mosaicing of the final data sets .",
    "individual science exposures were typically 1200 sec .",
    "mosaic sizes vary between galaxies , but are typically of the order of six to twelve ifu positions , yielding mosaics of the order 20  to 60  on a side .",
    "since our targets completely fill each ifu pointing , it is not possible to generate a sky subtraction solution from fibres within each ifu pointing . to achieve accurate sky subtraction ,",
    "a small number of dedicated offset sky frames was taken each night .",
    "data was processed in real time at the telescope using the ` 2dfdr ` software package .",
    "this allowed monitoring of the observing conditions such that the mosaic pattern could be repeated or adapted if required .",
    "the final data analysis was carried out using a custom suite of idl routines .",
    "there are four isolated `` dead elements '' within the spiral ifu . during the reduction process",
    ", these are replaced with the average spectrum of the four adjacent ifu elements prior to mosaicing the data .",
    "individual frames were then aligned and mosaiced using telescope offset information and a suite of custom written software tools .",
    "frames are scaled , based on an iterative comparison of overlap regions in the mosaic , in order to account for minor variations in transparency , seeing and exposure time .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ bubble ]    [ default ]    in most simulations to date , the terminal velocity of gas entrained by a galactic wind is @xmath15 km s@xmath8 ( e.g.  suchkov_etal._1994 ; cooper_etal . _  2008 ) .",
    "proper comparisons are difficult because the models deal with clumpiness in the entrained gas , which the scaling relations above do not .",
    "chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) provide a useful formula for the terminal velocity of a cloud accelerated by a wind ( see also strickland & heckman 2008 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the initial distance and column density of the cloud .",
    "( this formula is specific to the  constant velocity \" phase of the wind before it breaks free of the confining medium . )",
    "the factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 account for the fractions of supernova energy and mass respectively that work to heat the diffuse gas .",
    "these authors explore fractions in the range 0.1 to 1 and ultimately favour the high end of this range . in any event",
    ", the dynamical time of the wind is roughly @xmath21 myr ( see also cooper_etal . _  2008 ) which is considerably longer than the cooling time of the entrained gas .",
    "the wind timescale is comparable to the dynamical time of the starburst region itself , but is up to an order of magnitude less than the ionisation timescale @xmath22 established by our analysis above .",
    "this is a striking result that suggests a substantial delay ( @xmath23 myr ) after the onset of star formation before the conditions for a large - scale wind are properly established .      in the starburst wind objects , the overall ionisation properties are consistent with shock processes ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "a simple calculation can validate this . from dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the total shock luminosity is @xmath24 these authors find that about 50% of the mechanical energy is converted into energy capable of ionizing gas .",
    "assuming there is sufficient gas to soak up the ionizing photons , one can derive a useful relation for the h@xmath1 luminosity , such that @xmath25    we now derive a canonical h@xmath1 surface brightness for shock - ionised filaments associated with the galactic wind . for a galaxy at a distance of @xmath26 mpc , the observed h@xmath1 flux from the shock",
    "is @xmath27 which assumes , consistent with dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) , that only a single shock surface is observed with no correction for possible limb brightening .",
    "the surface brightness of shocked emission at 1 kpc follows : @xmath28 the pre - shock density normalization assumes that the halo gas in starburst galaxies follows an isothermal distribution ( e.g.  cooper_etal .",
    "_  2008 ) normalised to a pre - shock density of @xmath29 @xmath30 at 1 kpc consistent with material swept up in a wind ( q.v .",
    "chevalier & clegg 1985 ; see below ) .",
    "post - shock densities inferred from the [ sii ] doublet ( e.g.  mccarthy_etal . _  1987 ) are typically in the low density limit ( @xmath31 @xmath30 ) beyond @xmath32 pc .",
    "while equation  [ surfbri2 ] has a strong dependence on @xmath33 , the shock speed is well constrained by observation .",
    "some authors have associated the terminal velocity of entrained gas with the shock velocity induced by the wind ( e.g.  maloney 1999 ) .",
    "but the levels of ionisation tell a different story .",
    "the strong [ nii]/[oiii ] signal favours shock velocities of order 100 km s@xmath8",
    "( e.g.shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ; veilleux & rupke 2002 ) .",
    "this is supported by the soft x - ray emission which appears to be powered by similar shock velocities .",
    "how are we to understand this ?    in our picture , the fast hot wind accelerates denser gas to a terminal velocity .",
    "these clouds are ram - pressure confined by the fast wind .",
    "we therefore write down a simple equation for shocks driven into the clouds such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the wind density and velocity .",
    "strickland & heckman ( 2009 ) have recently conducted an excellent re - evaluation of chevalier & clegg s original model for the m82 wind .",
    "the free - flowing or break - out wind speeds can be as high as @xmath37 km s@xmath8 .",
    "for our adopted values of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 above , we can balance equation  [ pram ] with @xmath41 @xmath30 , a factor of a few higher than the canonical solution at 1 kpc presented by strickland & heckman ( 2009 ) .",
    "we consider this to be broadly consistent given the uncertainties . in our simple analysis ,",
    "the shock velocity is always several times less than the terminal velocity of clouds caught in the flow .",
    "our simple model leads to an h@xmath1 surface brightness of @xmath42 cgs at 1 kpc .",
    "this approximate value is comparable to what is presented in table  [ gas extent ] for the starburst galaxies . in principle , the filling factor of the shocked material can be low ( @xmath43 ) , and there will be moderate levels of extinction internal to the entrained gas ( i.e.  @xmath44 mag ; cecil_etal._2001 ) .",
    "but in principle , a moderately fast shock could account for the observed , extended line emission .",
    "we note that the h@xmath1 surface brightness in equation  [ surfbri2 ] is comparable to the observed agn surface brightness in table  [ gas extent ] , but much fainter than the predicted agn surface brightness in equation  [ surfbri1 ] .",
    "this may indicate that the filling factor in the wind filaments is @xmath45 .",
    "fortunately , a discussion of the _ relative _ merits of different ionisation sources does not require knowledge of the gas filling factor @xmath46 .",
    "a lower filling factor affects the theoretical prediction identically in equations  [ surfbri1 ] and [ surfbri2 ] , and usefully brings our models into line with the observations , at least in principle .",
    "thus , if agn winds involve similar processes to starburst winds , we would not expect shocks to outshine direct photoionisation from the agn , consistent with our observations .",
    "we have already argued that shocks outshine direct stellar photoionisation from the starburst because the young starburst has dimmed tremendously by the time the wind breaks out .",
    "close to the disk , we may still expect stellar photoionisation to dominate over shocks owing to large - scale star formation in the disk ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 ) .",
    "but much beyond 300 pc or so , wind - driven shocks can dominate the ionisation , as observed in our sample .",
    "if we invoke a lower filling factor consistent with agn winds , we can readily explain ngc  3628 , but now ngc  253 and ngc  1482 appear overluminous .",
    "indeed , a careful study of table  [ gas extent ] reveals the need to change @xmath46 over the range ( 0.1,1 ) to match our model to all of the observations .",
    "this may indicate that our model is oversimplified and needs to include a gas filling factor , or even a correction for internal extinction ( although this is found to be typically less than 10% from the spiral observations in the brightest regions ) .",
    "we note two things :",
    "( i ) the inferred filling factors are not unreasonable and can be directly measured in principle ; ( ii ) alternatively , the inferred extinction corrections are plausible , and these can also be directly inferred from the balmer decrement with data of sufficient sensitivity .",
    "we conclude with a `` big picture '' model of the starburst wind phenomenon .",
    "our purpose is to provide a physical explanation for the delay before the galactic wind gets going .",
    "we believe that this simple model explains the broadest features of our new spiral observations .",
    "therefore the stages of evolution for a galactic wind are as follows :    \\(1 ) stars are born in dense molecular clouds whereupon the hot massive stars produce a strong uv radiation field ( lada & lada 2003 ) ;    \\(2 ) the mean free path of lyman continuum photons is greatly extended by stellar winds ( and radiation pressure ) that blow bubbles into the surrounding ism .",
    "( good discussions of this process are to be found in castor_etal . _  1975 ; weaver_etal . _  1977 ; maclow & mccray 1988 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 . )",
    "the intense uv radiation ionizes any pre - existing intracloud medium but this may have been cleared out by an earlier wind .",
    "\\(3 ) the over - pressured warm gas evaporated from the surfaces of dense clouds helps to fill the wind - blown `` voids '' and intracloud region .",
    "the connection between the evaporating cloud skins and the intracloud wind material may help the wind to entrain denser gas from these same clouds ( cooper_etal .",
    "_  2008 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the bulk of the supernova ejecta arises after 8 - 10 myr ( fig .",
    "[ starburst99a ] ; leitherer_etal .",
    "_  1992 ) .",
    "as noted by others ( e.g.  chevalier & clegg 1985 ) , the ejecta ultimately thermalizes the diffuse material which escapes as a wind ; any shock heating of the denser medium escapes as infrared radiation ( strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "the uv intensity declines dramatically since many of the high - mass stars have now exploded .",
    "thus we are led to an important conclusion . _",
    "the large - scale wind can not become established until vast quantities of warm diffuse gas are dislodged from the surfaces of dense clouds by uv evaporation . _",
    "the ionised material with a sufficiently long cooling time is then mechanically heated by the supernova mass / energy input .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that , by the time the wind gets going , most of the short - lived massive stars have faded or disappeared .",
    "we would therefore _ not _ expect to see a strong signature of stellar photoionisation in the extended wind filaments if the starburst phenomenon arises from a _ single _ burst of star formation .",
    "_ our new observations may provide the strongest evidence yet that starbursts truly are impulsive events_. the fact that the signature of agn photoionisation _ is _ clearly visible in the wind filaments argues that the accretion - disk uv timescale is considerably longer than the starburst timescale .",
    "furthermore , unlike the starburst , the mechanical energy input _ must _ have occurred early in the life of the agn , presumably at a time when jets can also be launched .",
    "we argue that our observations are a testament to this simple picture .",
    "conversely , if there are starburst sources where stellar photoionisation _",
    "does _ dominate at large radial distances ( cf .",
    "shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) , we anticipate that the circumnuclear regions in these sources are characterised by an extended episode of star formation ( i.e.  continuous star formation ) due to an extended period of fuelling and accretion ( e.g.  sustained merger activity ) .",
    "the role of mass / energy feedback and recycling in galactic winds over cosmic time is very poorly understood . in particular , we are far from a detailed understanding of how gas accretion to the circumnuclear regions fuels local star formation and nuclear activity .",
    "so what can we say ?    the galaxy wind phenomenon is well established and its influence can be detected in the highest redshift sources ( heckman_etal .",
    "_  1990 ; strickland_etal .",
    "_  2004b ; veilleux_etal .",
    "_  2005 ) .",
    "galactic winds are associated with both star formation ( e.g.  starbursts ) , nuclear activity ( e.g.  fr  i radio sources ) , and a combination of star formation and nuclear activity ( e.g.  seyfert galaxies ) .",
    "but this raises many questions .",
    "how do winds get going , how energetic are they , how long do they last , and what is their role in galaxy evolution ?",
    "do we arrive at similar answers for agn - driven winds and starburst - driven winds ?",
    "here we are able to shed light on the first question (  [ events ] ) .",
    "we have carried out the most detailed and extensive survey to date of extended plasma gas in active galaxies .",
    "we constructed ionisation diagnostic diagrams to study the nature of the emission in ten galaxies .",
    "we find that the wholly starburst - powered sources have extended emission that is largely consistent with shock ionisation .",
    "this sets an important lower limit on the time at which the starburst phenomenon began ( @xmath47 myr ) . at this time",
    ", the stellar uv ionisation sources have long since faded from view which essentially rules out a continuous star formation model for the nucleus , at least in our limited subset of starburst galaxies .",
    "an interesting question is whether we can identify those sources that are in an early starburst phase and before the onset of the large - scale wind .",
    "the second question presents difficulties for us , at least in the present analysis . in all of our agn sources",
    ", there is evidence of circumnuclear star formation : the present data are unable to establish which source of activity is responsible for the wind . in future studies",
    ", it may be possible to shed light on this question in one of two ways .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy can , in principle , establish the [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratio of the outflowing gas .",
    "enhanced @xmath1 abundances implicate the presence of sn ii , and therefore the central importance of the starburst in driving the outflow .",
    "such an effect may have already been seen in dwarf starburst galaxies ( @xcite , ott , walter & brinks ( 2005 ) ) , but we are unaware of similar studies in seyfert outflow sources .",
    "this is an important avenue for future research .",
    "an alternative approach is to carefully trace the pressure changes over the circumnuclear regions down to small galactic radii .",
    "oconnell & mangano ( 1978 ) noticed that the gas densities , as measured from the [ sii ] doublet , appear to decrease along the minor axis of m82 .",
    "chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) interpreted this observation as a change of wind pressure in a starburst - driven wind .",
    "this idea has been explored extensively by heckman_etal . _  ( 1990 ) who used the [ sii]doublet to measure the electron densities as a function of radius in a subset of starburst galaxies . in m82",
    ", high pressures have been inferred from the [ siii ]  doublet ( houck_etal . _  ( 1984 ) , @xcite ) , from fine structure lines in the far infrared ( lugten_etal . _  1986 ; duffy_etal . _  1987 ) , and from the non - thermal radio continuum ( schaaf_etal . _  1989 ) .",
    "after certain assumptions , pressures can be inferred by combining observations of radio recombination lines and the associated free - free emission ( rodriguez & chaisson 1980 ; seaquist , bell & bignell 1985 ) .",
    "the intrinsically higher resolution of linked radio receivers should allow the pressure profile to be traced to the smallest vlbi spatial scales .",
    "naively , the pressure profile can be relatively steep closer to the black hole compared to an anticipated flatter profile across the energy injection region of a starburst ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "thus , we may be able to distinguish between agn - powered vs. starburst - powered momentum by measuring the gas pressure as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "we leave this to future work .    in the case of the agn sources ,",
    "we find that the extended line emission is always powered by the accretion disk rather than by shock ionisation .",
    "some of these sources are clearly associated with central starbursts that may well contribute momentum to the outflow in which case age - dating the onset of the outflow is more problematic . in the case of the agn - driven outflow ,",
    "these could have commenced as recently as 10 myr or so , although if the starburst dominates , the longer timescale is preferred .",
    "the latter case is interesting because it would indicate that the agn source has a lifetime approaching 100 myr , and that the amount of gas converted to energy is of order 10@xmath48 .    in the next paper",
    ", we combine the ionisation diagnostics with the emission - line kinematics to learn more about the energetics of the outflowing gas .",
    "the integral field spectrograph approach is clearly very powerful for studying extended emission line sources .",
    "we stress that our methods for deriving and comparing ionisation and dynamic timescales can be extended to a wider class of active galaxies ( e.g.quasar hosts ) , mergers ( e.g.  ulirgs ) and star - forming galaxies ( e.g.dwarf irregulars )",
    ". it will be interesting to compare the inferred timescales with the star formation histories extracted from circumnuclear stellar populations . in high - redshift galaxies where stellar populations are harder to observe , the ionisation diagnostics may provide key information . in the appendix",
    ", we include a brief discussion about how future studies can be improved to advance this work further .",

    "it provides both detailed ionisation diagnostics and kinematics over the extent of the outflowing gas .",
    "we have demonstrated how these idds can be used to classify the nature of the wind outflow for each source , and to define spatial zones in which different ionisation sources dominate .",
    "furthermore , we have begun the process of spectral and spatial kinematic and ionisation deconvolution for each source , in an effort to disentangle the complexity of each system .",
    "we conclude that blue sensitivity ( below 500 nm ) is a key factor to many of the diagnostic requirements , in particular sensitivity to the h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  spectral region ( with spiral we can not comment on the utility of [ oii ]  emission feature for such work ) . as a clear shock diagnostic ,",
    "[ oi ]  is also of great value to classification of the nature of the ionisation source , although in all cases presented in this work , sensitivity to the [ oiii ]  emission still presents the primary limitation .",
    "this limitation is imposed in part by the reduced throughput of the blue arm of the aaomega system @xcite but will remain an important consideration for more balanced systems .",
    "spectral resolution is critical to disentangling the multiple emission components of many of the sources discussed , with line splitting in many of the outflows only marginally resolved in our r@xmath125000 spectroscopy ( @xmath1250  km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "one must of course also consider wavelength coverage . while many of the fainter lines common to ism studies may be beyond the reach of a survey such as ours ( for example the temperature sensitive [ nii ]  @xmath525756 line is typically rather faint ) we have demonstrated the added value of an extended spectral range in contrast to the limited coverage usually practical with fabry - prot tunable filter systems such as that employed for example by @xcite",
    ". a range of source redshifts , even for a nearby galaxy sample , further complicates the choice of wavelength range selection .",
    "the observations and interpretation presented here have been possible primarily due to the high surface brightness sensitivity of the aaomega - spiral system afforded by the large projected spatial pixel size on the sky .",
    "the 0.7arcsec on a side square elements provide an individual field of view of 0.49arcsec@xmath53 , which represents factors of @xmath122 , 5.4 & 12 increase in contrast to 0.5,0.3 or 0.2arcsec systems , more than accounting for the smaller size of the prime mirror of the aat 3.9 m when compared to systems available on the current generation of large optical telescopes .",
    "this allows spiral to move out of the detector readnoise limit , below which re - binning of adjacent apertures will not recover signal - to - noise quickly . as recently demonstrated by westmoquette _ etal .",
    "_  09a / b , in truth one must ultimately combine the wide field of view and low surface brightness observations practicable with large pixels , with dedicated narrow field observations at higher spatial resolution of critical regions of each object ."
