    "we must rely on indirect arguments based on primordial nucleosynthesis to constrain exactly when this photon entropy in our hubble patch came into being , and whether this injection of energy would have a direct impact on short - distance structure formation .",
    "energy injection prior to @xmath80 is redistributed into a planckian form : @xmath81 defines the redshift of the cosmic photosphere .",
    "there have been heroic efforts to explain the cmb as starlight processed through exotic forms of dust ( in particular long conducting needles ) that would have happened much later .",
    "the observables from these models have never been fully worked out ( see , @xcite ) , but they are severely challenged by the absence of spectral distortions and the high degree of anisotropy required .    between @xmath81 and @xmath82 injected energy is redistributed into a bose - einstein shape characterized by a chemical potential , which firas constrains to be @xcite @xmath83 ( 95%  cl ) , translating to a limit on energy of @xmath84 in this redshift range .",
    "below @xmath85 the compton @xmath86-distortion formula holds , giving a unique signature to distortions , negative for frequencies below @xmath87 ghz , positive above , and a stringent limit on the compton - cooling energy loss from hot gas , @xmath88 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "if there is no recombination , there is a constraint from the @xmath86-distortion on how early reheating of the universe can have occurred : @xmath89 @xcite , but it is not very restrictive for the low @xmath90 favoured by standard big bang nucleosynthesis and can be avoided if one can sustain a temperature of the cooling electrons to be nearly the cmb temperature .",
    "compton cooling has been observed in more than two dozen massive clusters of galaxies above the @xmath91-@xmath92 level , including one at redshift 0.545 , which tells us that the cmb existed by at least that redshift . with likely experimental sensitivity increases ,",
    "the sz effect may eventually offer a more powerful probe of the cluster distribution than @xmath93-ray observations do : instead of being a projection of the square of the baryon density , it is a projection of the electron pressure and the decrease in signal with redshift is only a consequence of cluster evolution , not dimming by distance .",
    "combining the sz and @xmath93-ray observations is one of the main paths to @xmath94 ( and in principle @xmath95 ) , but is so far more confusing than enlightening , with values ranging from small ( @xmath96 for abell 2218 ) to large ( @xmath97 for coma ) ; the hope is that a well - selected sample of clusters may help to reduce the biases .",
    "the integrated contribution of compton - cooling from clusters and groups is not expected to be large for models of structure formation that reproduce the cluster x - ray temperature distribution function .",
    "for example @xcite , for variants of adiabatic dark - matter dominated @xmath98 models with @xmath99 , @xmath100 and nearly scale - invariant initial conditions , the estimated value depends sensitively on @xmath0 , the linear amplitude of density fluctuations on the cluster - scale @xmath101 , and somewhat on the local curvature of the density fluctuation spectrum on cluster - scales : with @xmath102 , a hot / cold hybrid model with @xmath103 gives @xmath104 , a tilted cdm model with @xmath105 gives @xmath106 , with a similar value obtained for a @xmath107 model .",

    "the firas limit on general secondary backgrounds ( without a unique signature like be or @xmath86 distortions ) is @xmath113 ( @xmath54 cl ) .",
    "if pregalactic dust , or dust in primeval galaxies , exists , it will absorb higher frequency radiation ( uv and optical ) and down - shift it into the infrared ( @xcite ) ; combined with the redshift , a sub - mm background is expected but , with firas , is now quite strongly constrained",
    ". the radiation could be largely shortward of @xmath114 : the peak in the @xmath115 curve occurs at @xmath116 for @xmath117 dust , which could be around @xmath118 if the dust is hot ( which seems reasonable ) or the redshift of bulge / elliptical formation is low .",

    "a predominantly hydrodynamic explanation for cosmic structure development is a perfectly reasonable extrapolation of known behaviour in the interstellar medium to the pregalactic medium .",

    "( one may also argue that the specific tapestry that we see is too close to what straightforward gravitational instability predicts to warrant consideration of a purely hydrodynamical model ; that the explosive effects might be largely masked by subsequent gravitational instability .",
    "what does seem inevitable is that there will be a more limited local hydrodynamics role around collapsed objects . )",
    "the development of spectral distortions or angular anisotropies in the microwave background is described by radiative transfer equations for the photon distribution function , which are coupled to einstein s equations for the gravitational field and to the hydrodynamic and transport equations for the other types of matter present .",

    "much work has also gone into relating bulk flows of galaxies to cmb anisotropy observations on intermediate angular scales , since they probe the same bands in @xmath165-space , and this has led to significant constraints , but is also subject to much debate .",
    "the shape of the density power spectrum is almost as powerful a constraint as @xmath0 is . to fit the large scale galaxy clustering data , in particular the apm angular correlation function , requires @xmath366 @xcite , assuming the galaxy power spectrum on large scales is a linear amplification of the ( linear ) density power spectrum . in the lower panels of fig .",

    "the cobe - determined @xmath0 goes down with decreasing @xmath308 ( and increasing @xmath259 ) .",
    "these models are not so attractive because @xmath308 drops so precipitously with increasing @xmath259 for fixed age ( for 13 gyr and @xmath335 , @xmath403=0.055 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sig8cldmr ] ) has not been modified to treat open models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "texture and string models require a low @xmath0 , @xmath404 . at this stage , it is still unclear how much of a problem this is since non - gaussian effects can modify the cluster distribution , partly compensating for the low @xmath0 .    going to higher @xmath165-bands , cobe - normalized spectra imply values for the `` the redshift of galaxy formation '' , of quasar formation , and the amount of gas in damped lyman alpha systems and this also significantly restricts the parameter space .",
    "however , it is more dependent on the role gasdynamics may play in defining the objects .    if we are so bold as to assume that we now know the shape of the density power spectrum over the large scale structure band , and the amplitude of the power spectrum on cluster - scales , then , in conjunction with the cobe anisotropy level , the range of inflation and dark matter models is considerably restricted .",
    "whether the solution will be a simple variant on the cdm+inflation theme @xcite , involving slight tilt ( or more radical broken scale invariance ) , stable ev - mass neutrinos , decaying ( @xmath405kev)-neutrinos , vacuum energy , low @xmath94 , high baryon fraction , mean curvature , or some combination , is still open , but can be decided as the observations tighten , and , in particular , as the noise in the @xmath12 figure subsides , revealing the details of the doppler peaks , a very happy future for those of us who wish to peer into the mechanism by which structure was generated in the universe .",
