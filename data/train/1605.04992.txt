    "it is widely believed that the black hole accretion flows are the central engine of the luminous compact objects like active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries ( bhbs ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of such objects are mainly composed of the soft component and the power - low component .",
    "the soft component is dominant over the power - low component in the high - soft state as well as in the slim disk state , and , in contrast , the power - low component is quite prominent in the low - hard state and in the very high state .",
    "the soft component is accepted to be multi - color disk blackbody , which is emitted from the relatively cold , optically thick accretion disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the power - low component is thought to be produced due to the compton upscattering in the hot and less - dense regions ( so - called disk corona ) . from the observational point of view",
    ", @xcite suggested the several models for the disk corona , and @xcite reported the cold disk is truncated around the black hole and the flow within the truncation radius is consist of the hot gas .",
    "however , both the structure and the formation mechanism of the hot , rarefied plasma around the cold disk is not understood yet .",
    "the most important mechanism to heat up the matter around the black hole is the dissipation of the magnetic energy . since a part of the kinetic energy of the accretion flow",
    "is converted to the magnetic energy via the magnetorotational instability , the dissipation of the enhanced magnetic energy works to increase the gas temperature .",
    "indeed , this mechanism is thought to be origin of the viscous heating in the accretion disk .",
    "however , the radiative cooling prevents the gas from the rising in the gas temperature in the dense regions .",
    "thus , study by the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) is insufficient and we need the radiation - mhd ( rmhd ) .",
    "the formation of the hot , rarefied regions above the cold disk has been reported by the rmhd simulations of a local patch of the disk @xcite , the global rmhd simulations @xcite and the general relativistic ( gr ) rmhd simulations @xcite . however , the dependency of the mass accretion rate hasnt been investigated well enough yet .",
    "in addition , the rotation of the black hole might cooperate the heating of the gas around the black hole .",
    "the rotational energy of the black hole is extracted and transported outward by the poynting flux .",
    "if the transported electromagnetic energy is dissipated in the less dense regions , the gas temperature would drastically increase .",
    "this should be resolved by the grrmhd simulations .    in this paper , by performing the three - dimensional grrmhd simulations , we study the formation of the hot , rarefied regions around the black holes .",
    "we will show that the relatively cold disk is truncated around the black hole and the flow becomes very hot within the truncation radius .",
    "the hot , rarefied regions also appear above the cold disk . in addition , we study the change of the size and the gas temperature of the hot regions due to the difference of the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin . in  2 , basic equations and numerical method are described .",

    "the maximum gas temperature in the overheated region is about ten times higher for the rotating black hole than for the non - rotating black hole . in the case of the rotating black hole ,",
    "since the electromagnetic energy is enhanced at the very vicinity of the black hole and transported outward by the poynting flux , the matter would be effectively heated up .",
    "our low-@xmath81 models would explain the very high state of the bhbs .",
    "the very high state is thought to appear for the near- or sub - eddington case , and the power - low component is dominant over the soft component .",
    "@xcite reported that the inner part of the optically - thick disk does not reach to the isco radius in this state , and the effective compton upscattering produces the strong power - low spectra .",
    "such features nicely fit our results of models a0r4 , a0r4 - 2 , and a9r4 , whereby the truncated disk is sandwiched by the overheated regions . on the other hand , our model",
    "a0r2 would correspond to the slim disk state .",
    "@xcite succeeded in reproducing the observed x - ray spectra of the ultra luminous x - ray source , using the slim disk model which is not truncated . in our super - eddington model ( a0r2 ) ,",
    "the truncation radius is very close to the isco radius , so that our result is not inconsistent with the observations .      here",
    "we note that , the multi - frequency radiation transfer calculations are needed to accurately investigate the emergent spectra .",
    "such calculations are attempted by @xcite in which the hard x - ray spectra is obtained by performing the post - processing radiation transfer calculations including the compton upscattering and down - scattering ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is difficult to accurately treat the gas - radiation interaction via the compton process in the hydrodynamics simulations . in @xcite ,",
    "the compton heating / cooling is calculated by solving the kompaneets equation based on the assumption that the radiation has a blackbody spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite also performed hydrodynamics simulations taking into account the comptonization . in their method , the assumption of the blackbody spectrum is relaxed and the conservation of number of photons is carefully treated .",
    "however , as long as the kompaneets equation is employed , the simulations would induce some inaccuracies in the regions of anisotropic radiation fields like around the photosphere .",
    "multi - frequency rmhd simulations are necessary to resolve this problem , but such simulations are too time consuming to perform .",
    "the time for simulations is limited in the present work as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , especially for run c. the structure of the magnetic fields might change by graduation due to the magnetic dynamo . if it does , the structure of the overheated regions is influenced .",
    "thus , the long - term three - dimensional simulations should be explored in future work , since it is well known that no magnetic dynamo works in the axisymmetric calculations .",
    "two - dimensional simulations including the sub - grid dynamo model is another way @xcite .",
    "simulations of higher resolution are left as important future work . in order to revolve the magnetorotational instability ,",
    "it has been reported that @xmath210 is required @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath211 is evaluated as @xmath212 with @xmath213 being the grid size in theta direction @xcite . in model a0r4 ,",
    "in which the disk is the thinnest in the present work , @xmath214 is @xmath215 around @xmath216 .",
    "this value is comparable to the required value of @xmath217 , so that it is better to perform simulations with small @xmath213 .",
    "finally , m-1 closure method employed in the present work is known to be somewhat problematic in the optically very thin or moderately thin regions .",
    "the accurate radiation fields can be obtained by solving radiation transfer equations .",
    "such a method has been proposed by @xcite    numerical computations were carried out on cray xc30 at the center for computational astrophysics of national astronomical observatory of japan , on fx10 at information technology center of the university of tokyo , and on k computer at aics .",
