    "the quantitative investigation of the magnetism of structures in the solar atmosphere is done through the analysis of the observed stokes profiles . particularly difficult",
    "is to infer the properties of weakly magnetized regions of the solar surface such as the quiet internetwork .",
    "the reason is that the observed polarization signals often stay at the detection limit of modern spectro - polarimeters because the spatial resolution is still not high enough to resolve the smallest magnetic structures .",
    "therefore , the magnetic properties are inferred assuming unresolved structures , which is model dependent .    due to lack of information , it is customary to apply relatively simple models to explain the observations .",
    "the model parameters are estimated using a least - squares ( or , equivalently , maximum - likelihood ) approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and many others ) or using a fully bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "for the inversion of unresolved structures , the idea of using several components that contribute to the observed stokes profiles has been around since its introduction by @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "the method consists in using a filling factor @xmath0 of the pixel that accounts for a non - magnetized component ( either stray - light or a pure non - magnetic plasma ) and the remaining @xmath1 fraction of the pixel is filled by a magnetic component .",
    "this paper points out that , in case the stray - light contamination is obtained directly from the observations as an average over a given field - of - view , some modifications are necessary in the inversion procedure to take into account the eventual presence of correlation between the observed stokes profiles and the stray - light .",
    "this modification has the remarkable property of penalizing large stray - light contaminations .",
    "in order to obtain information on the magnetic and thermodynamical properties of the solar atmosphere , one proposes a model atmosphere that depends on a set of parameters ( e.g. , the temperature @xmath2 at one or several heights , hydrogen density , magnetic field strength and inclination , etc ) .",
    "this model is used to synthesize the stokes vector @xmath3 for an arbitrary number of spectral lines at given spatial position @xmath4 and wavelength @xmath5 . expressing the observed stokes profiles as @xmath6 , it is customary to obtain the `` best '' parameters @xmath7 as those minimizing the following merit function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath8 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_i(x , y,\\lambda_j ) } , \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where the sum over @xmath9 is extended to all @xmath10 observed wavelength points . in this equation , @xmath11 represents the variance of the numerator , for each wavelength @xmath12 , stokes parameter @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and at each location @xmath15 , due to possible uncertainties in the observations ( measurement errors and noise ) .",
    "this is different from `` real '' variations due to space - time fluctuations ( e.g. , intensity contrast due to granule - intergranule fluctuations ) .",
    "usually , the model is known with certainty as when we fit a gaussian profile to an observed spectral line , and @xmath11 is just the noise variance @xmath16 of the data .",
    "this noise variance can be estimated from the observations , ideally , by taking several observations of the same object under identical observational conditions .",
    "unfortunately , this is often just not possible .",
    "it is then customary in spectroscopic observations to select a continuum window and , assuming that it should be spectrally flat , all fluctuations are due to noise .",
    "the flatness assumption is usually not fulfilled due to systematic effects and the estimated variance might be larger than the one associated with random noise effects . with wavelength across strong spectral lines .",
    "this is a very interesting problem that will be considered elsewhere . ]",
    "however , it is also possible that the model contribute to the variance uncertainty by incorporating explicitly some observable for example , if we fit a gaussian profile to an observed spectral line , but keeping the equivalent width of the observed line profile .",
    "we study here an example of this type that arises naturally when considering stray light in spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "the proper interpretation and inversion of spectropolarimetric observations with spatial resolution requires some treatment of stray light .",
    "`` stray light '' refers to the unavoidable spread of light from different regions on the source .",
    "it is an effect produced by the extended tails of the telescope s point spread function , which causes that a significant fraction of the photons detected in one pixel results from regions outside the airy disk . as a consequence",
    ", there is always some amount of contamination from regions other than the region that was supposed to be imaged by the instrument .",
    "this problem has become especially pressing recently , with the advent of high - resolution space - borne spectropolarimeters like the sp @xcite aboard _ hinode _ @xcite . to deal with this problem when carrying out inversions of stokes profiles from quiet regions of the solar photosphere ,",
    "the following model has been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the stokes profiles emerging from a model atmosphere representative for a magnetized region occupying a fraction @xmath1 of the pixel ( from now on , we drop the dependence of the variables on @xmath5 ) .",
    "the term @xmath19 is a stray - light contamination profile that is obtained from a local average of the @xmath20 pixels around the pixel of interest ( of the order of 1 arcsec@xmath21 around the pixel of interest for hinode observations ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the set of @xmath20 pixels that is considered to be affecting the pixel of interest .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 quantifies the amount of stray - light contamination . in this case , the denominator of the @xmath24 function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) is : @xmath25.\\ ] ]    the presence of @xmath26 , which depends on the observations @xmath27 , produces that the variance is not just the noise variance because a certain degree of correlation might exist between @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "the reason is that both quantities are affected by noise and systematic effects and they are the result of a complex reduction process that might introduce some correlation .",
    "a straightforward calculation allows us to simplify the variance to : @xmath29 .",

    "( [ eq : variance_final ] ) results in : @xmath33         this expression for the variance has several interesting properties .",
    "it depends on the stray - light contamination coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "the term in @xmath34 accounts for the inclusion of additional noise variance coming from the stray - light profile .",
    "its influence is heavily reduced when averaging over many pixels , decreasing in proportion to the number of pixels added .",
    "the linear term depends on the covariance between the observed stokes profile at a given wavelength and the average profile that is considered as stray - light contamination .",
    "this term also goes to zero when many pixels are considered for the averaging , so we recommend to obtain the stray - light contamination profile as an average over the full field - of - view",
    ". a non - zero contribution can be produced by any spatially variable systematic effect present in the final focal plane produced by the camera ( flatfield systematics or fringes ) or by any optics before ( fringes ) .",
    "additionally , corrections carried out during data reduction can introduce correlations between surrounding pixels .",
    "finally , data compression like the jpeg compression used by hinode @xcite to optimize telemetry can also introduce correlation artifacts . as a consequence of this dependence on @xmath0 , the @xmath24 merit function",
    "to be optimized to get the maximum - likelihood parameters @xmath7 is different from the one commonly used in the literature .",
    "we shall see shortly that this can affect the results significantly .    although @xmath35 , strong anticorrelations ( @xmath36 ) can be effectively discarded in our case .",
    "figure  [ fig : variances ] shows how @xmath37 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma2_final ] ) ] varies with @xmath20 and @xmath32 , assuming that @xmath38 $ ] is constant on @xmath23 .",
    "taking @xmath39 is roughly equivalent to consider a neighborhood @xmath401.5@xmath41 around the pixel of interest at hinode s spatial sampling . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : variances ] , the dependence of the variance on @xmath20 is relatively weak and the parabolic shape of the curves tends to a straight line as @xmath20 increases .",
    "if @xmath42 , stray - light contaminations above the following limit are forbidden : @xmath43 which has been obtained as the solution of @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity rapidly tends to @xmath45 for increasing values of @xmath20 and is smaller than 1 , whenever @xmath46 and @xmath47 . if @xmath36 , the behavior is the opposite and large values of the stray - light contamination are favored .",
    "it is important to estimate the covariance between stray - light contamination and observed profiles . to this end",
    ", we use the quiet sun map observed by @xcite to compute the stray - light contamination in a typical hinode observation as an average over a window of @xmath401.5@xmath41 around every pixel of interest .",
    "the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_covariance ] shows the variance of the observed stokes @xmath48 continuum normalized to the average variance of the whole map .",
    "this is equivalent to the noise variance in case the continuum is assumed to be spectrally flat .",
    "our experience is that the average value of the standard deviation for stokes @xmath48 is a factor 3 - 4 larger than the noise estimation in stokes @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath14 made by @xcite .",
    "we assign this difference to the unavoidable presence of systematic effects in stokes @xmath48 due to flatfielding procedures .",
    "since they change from pixel to pixel , they can be absorbed as part of the noise , though probably not normally distributed .",
    "note the presence of conspicuous horizontal stripes that show the presence of pixels along the slit and at the points of the camera associated with continuum wavelengths which present a somewhat higher variance ( higher systematic effects ) .",
    "the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_covariance ] shows the value of @xmath32 for the whole map , which has been calculated using a small window in the continuum from 6302.915   to 6303.002  .",
    "strictly speaking , the covariance should have been calculated using many realizations of the measurement process with the underlying solar profile fixed . assuming some kind of _ ergodicity",
    "_ , we estimated the covariance using a wavelength window in the continuum . for consistency , we also estimated the covariance along the time using the time series of @xcite , with very similar results .",
    "again , the presence of horizontal stripes is clear , pointing to the systematic character of such defects . on average ,",
    "@xmath51 , although the distribution of covariances is clearly heavy - tailed , with the presence of large values of @xmath32 much more frequently than in the case of a gaussian distribution .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_covariance ] present histograms of the maps .",
    "a characteristic is that it is possible to find unphysical @xmath52 , a consequence of the small sample with which this quantity is computed .",
    "it is customary in standard inversion codes to introduce different weights for each stokes parameter so that stokes @xmath48 does not dominate the merit function .",
    "one may think that this alleviates the effect of covariance on the inferred parameters .",
    "however , the inclusion of weights does not mimic properly the form of @xmath24 because the variance term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma2_final ] ) depends explicitly on one of the model parameters , although the intuition is partially right .",
    "therefore , one would expect differences with respect to the parameters obtained with a standard @xmath24 .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : results_map ] .",
    "this table shows the results of a least - squares fit to the stokes profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stokes ] for different values of @xmath32 .",
    "the model proposed is that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model_stray ] ) where the magnetic component is a milne - eddington atmosphere and the stray - light contamination is obtained from a local average of @xmath39 pixels around the one of interest .",
    "the table presents the magnetic field strength @xmath53 and inclination @xmath54 , together with the stray - light contamination @xmath0 that minimizes the @xmath24 for different values of @xmath32 and the value of the reduced @xmath24 at the minimum .",
    "a striking effect of the inclusion of stray - light is that the value of @xmath0 decreases as soon as @xmath32 increases , a direct consequence of the presence of positive correlations between the observed profile and the stray - light .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field strength has to be adjusted accordingly in order to maintain the magnetic flux density , much in the direction of what has been explored by @xcite .",
    "note that the cases with @xmath55 are not so common in the observations . as a consequence , since such large values are not representative of the sample profile , the fits are not good and they should be taken as indicative of what would happen in such a limiting case .",
    "finally , it is important to point out that this behavior would be reduced if the field is strong enough to produce a substantial zeeman splitting because the magnetic field strength can be inferred directly from the splitting .     are shown in red , @xmath56 in blue , @xmath57 in green and @xmath58 in magenta .",
    "all of them give reasonably good results but the model parameters change dramatically as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : results_map ] .",
    "note that the cases of large @xmath32 are not realistic in this situation since we adopt a covariance that is too large with respect to the correct one.[fig : stokes ] ]",
    "we have demonstrated that the inversion of stokes profiles with models that include stray - light contaminations obtained from the same observations has to be carried out with care . in general , the @xmath24 merit function is modified and has to include the effect of the variance of the stray - light profile and the covariance between such profile and the one being inverted .",
    "the most important consequence is that the noise variance now depends on the stray - light contamination parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "a first contribution adds quadratically with the noise variance and is inversely proportional to the number of pixels that contribute to the stray - light profile .",
    "when the number of pixels is large enough , this term turns out to be almost negligible .",
    "the fundamental reason is that the signal - to - noise ratio of the stray - light profile increases and becomes much larger than that of the local profile , which dominates then the variance . if the stray - light contamination profile is obtained as an average over the full field - of - view , the effect of correlation diminishes considerably and the modified @xmath24 converges to the standard @xmath24 used in the past .",
    "a second contribution adds linearly and is much more delicate .",
    "it accounts for all the systematic effects ( fringes , flatfield systematics , data reduction effects , etc . )",
    "that plague the observations .",
    "the presence of systematics that are well above the noise level make both profiles vary similarly .",
    "the covariance term takes this into account by disfavoring models with large stray - light contaminations . in the absence of this term , any inversion method prefers to use a large stray - light contamination because the profiles become much more similar using the standard and incorrect @xmath24 . a simulated exercise",
    "have shown that neglecting the presence of this covariance might lead to artificially strong magnetic field strengths and large stray - light contaminations .",
