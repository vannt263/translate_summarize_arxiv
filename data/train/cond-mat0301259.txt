    "we find a crossover between the white noise behavior observed at short times , @xmath80 and the colored noise behavior recovered at large enough times , @xmath81 , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we observe that the exponents are halved when the noise is colored .",
    "further , we expect that the colored noise scaling will be observed for large enough time as soon as the correlation time @xmath58 is nonzero .",
    "this result may seem paradoxical at first sight because it is often wrongly thought that `` in the long time limit , colored noise appears white '' .",
    "in fact the period @xmath82 of the underlying deterministic oscillator must be compared with the correlation time @xmath58 of the noise .",
    "if @xmath83 the noise is uncorrelated over a period of the deterministic oscillator and acts as if it were white : the scalings found in eq .",

    "the crossover between the two regimes is observed when @xmath85 .",
    "the deterministic period @xmath82 decreases with the energy as @xmath86 @xcite . from eq.([scalmult ] ) , we have @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the crossover time scales as @xmath88 . as shown in figure 3 , numerical simulations confirm this scenario .",
    "such a crucial relevance of the correlation time of the noise was also found in the study of the bifurcation threshold of the duffing oscillator with multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "a particle trapped in a confining potential and subject to multiplicative noise undergoes anomalous diffusion before the dissipative time scale is reached .",
    "the critical exponents associated with this behaviour are calculated exactly in the case of gaussian white noise and an analytical expression for the intermediate time asymptotics of the p.d.f . in phase space is derived .",
    "our approach relies on the integrability of the underlying deterministic system : we derive exact stochastic equations in energy - angle variables and , after averaging out the phase variations , a projected dynamics for the energy variable is obtained .",
    "our analytical predictions agree perfectly with numerical simulations . for colored multiplicative noise",
    ", the anomalous diffusion exponents have been calculated in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we find that these exponents are halved in presence of time correlations , however small the correlation time @xmath89 may be .",
    "we observe a crossover from the white noise regime at _ short _ times to the colored noise scalings at _ long _ times .",
    "the associated crossover time scales like @xmath90 and corresponds to the regime when the period of the associated deterministic oscillator is of the order of @xmath89 . in the colored noise case , however , the averaging technique does not lead to conclusive results because the noise itself is averaged out to the leading order . a precise calculation in the case of colored gaussian noise",
