    "before the launch of _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , there was only one radio - quiet @xmath1-ray pulsar has been known , namely geminga ( i.e. psr  b0633 + 17 bertsch et al .",
    "the high sensitivity of large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ enables an efficient search of @xmath1-ray pulsars ( abdo et al .",

    "soon after the commence of the mission , ( abdo et al .",

    "2009 ; abdo et al .",
    "the population of radio - quiet @xmath1-ray pulsars has been expanded to 22 based on the extensive searches of saz parkinson et al .",
    "thanks to the improved search techniques provided by kerr ( 2011 ) & pletsch ( 2011 ) , in total , there are 31 radio - quiet @xmath1-ray pulsars are currently known ( pletsch et al . 2012a , b ) .    for this class of pulsars , the lack of knowledge in the phase relationship between the @xmath2ray light curve and that in radio leads to an ambiguity in investigating their emission region and physical processes ( see the discussion in trepl et al .",
    "2010 ) . therefore , pulsation searches in the other frequencies are fundamentally important for a better understanding to the physics of this class of pulsars .",
    "so far , there are only geminga ( halpern & holt 1992 ) and psr  j0007 + 7303 ( lin et al . 2010 ; caraveo et al .",
    "2010 ) have their x - ray pulsations been firmly detected . in this work",
    ", we reported our results of x - ray periodicity search of another member in this class  psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "psr  j2021 + 4026  is one of the brightest @xmath1-ray pulsars , which is associated with the supernova remnant ( snr ) g78.2 + 2.1 , detected by _",
    "lat shortly after its operation ( abdo et al .",
    "the possible association with snr suggests it is at a distance of @xmath3  kpc ( trepl et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "its proximity makes it as an ideal target for multi - wavelength investigations .",
    "several efforts have been devoted in searching its radio counterpart , no radio pulsar associated with psr  j2021 + 4026  has been detected so far ( becker et al . 2004 ; trepl et al .",
    "2010 ; ray et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the timing ephemeris of psr  j2021 + 4026  has been determined by _ fermi _ lat at different epochs ( abdo et al . 2009a,2010a ; ackermann et al .",
    "2011 ; ray et al . 2011 ; weisskopf 2011 ) and no obvious glitch was detected between the epoch of mjd 54680 to mjd 55600 .",
    "its observed period and period derivative ( @xmath4  ms and @xmath5  s  s@xmath6 ) imply a spin - down age of @xmath7  kyr , surface dipolar magnetic field strength of @xmath8  g and a spin - down power of @xmath9  erg  s@xmath6 . at a distance of 1.5  kpc ,",
    "its @xmath1-ray conversion efficiency is not dissimilar from that of geminga ( trepl et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in x - ray regime , a previously unidentified x - ray source ,",
    "2xmm  j202131.0 + 402645 , has been identified as the promising counterpart of psr  j2021 + 4026  ( trepl et al .",
    "2010 ; weisskopf et al .",
    "this source is found to be the only non - variable x - ray object without any optical / ir counterpart within its @xmath1-ray error circle .",
    "its association with the pulsar is reinforced by the fact that its x - ray position is consistent with the optimal @xmath1-ray timing solution .",
    "for firmly establishing the link between this x - ray source and psr  j2021 + 4026 , a x - ray periodicity search and a detailed spectroscopy is necessary .",
    "nevertheless , this is forbidden by the limited temporal resolution and the small photon statistics of the archival data . in view of this , we have investigated this geminga - like pulsar with a deep _ xmm - newton _ observation . in this letter , we report the discovery of the x - ray pulsation from psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "this is the third member of this class with the significant pulsation detected from both x - ray and @xmath2ray regimes .",

    "while the mos1/2 ccds were operated in full - window mode , pn ccd was operated in small - window mode with a temporal resolution of @xmath05.7 ms , which enables the pulsation search for the first time . with the most updated instrumental calibration",

    "we selected only those events for which the pattern was between @xmath12 for mos cameras and @xmath13 for the pn camera .",
    "we also noted that our data have been contaminated by the hard x - ray background flare .",
    "after removing all events which are potentially contaminated , the effective exposures are found to be 85  ks , 72  ks and 77  ks for mos1 , mos2 , pn respectively .      for timing analysis , we utilized solely the pn data for the pulsation search . to determine the source position of 2xmm  j202131.0 + 402645",
    ", we have run the source detection with the xmmsas task _ edetect@xmath14chain_.",
    "the source can be significantly detected with the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath15 at ( j2000 ) r.a.=@xmath16 , decl.=@xmath17 with the uncertainty @xmath18 .",
    "we extracted the events within a circular region of a 20@xmath19 radius centered at this position , which corresponds to an encircle energy function of @xmath20 . within an energy band of 0.1512 kev ,",
    "3174 counts were available for the timing analysis . with the aid of the task _ barycen _ ,",
    "the arrival times of all the selected events were barycentric corrected with the aforementioned x - ray position and the latest jpl de405 earth ephemeris .",
    "search around the rotational frequency of psr  j2021 + 4026  with the method of epoch - folding results in a very significant detection of x - ray pulsation from 2xmm  j202131.0 + 402645 . using either rayleigh - test ( mardia 1972 ; gibson et al . 1982 ) or @xmath21-test ( de jager et al . 1989",
    "; de jager & bsching 2010 ) , a significant peak is found at the frequency 3.7689937(9 )  hz ( = 0.26532281(6 )  s ) with @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the random probability of @xmath24 ( de jager & bsching 2010 ) .",
    "the quoted uncertainty of our detected frequency is determined by following the method in leahy et ( 1987 ) . although the ephemeris of psr  j2021 + 4026  has been determined several times by _ fermi _ lat observations at different epochs ( abdo et al . 2009a,2010a ; ackermann et al . 2011 ; ray et al .",
    "2011 ; weisskopf 2011 ) , none has covered the epoch of our _ xmm - newton _ observation ( i.e. @xmath0mjd  56028 ) . in order to avoid the uncertainties introduced by extrapolating these timing models to our observation epoch , we derived a @xmath2ray ephemeris which is contemporaneous with this x - ray observation for comparing the temporal properties in both regimes .",
    "we obtained the _ fermi _ lat data in the energy range of 0.1 - 300 gev within a circular region of interest ( roi ) with a @xmath25 radius from the x - ray position of psr  j2021 + 4026 . in order to achieve a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio and with the influence of the accumulated timing noise minimized , we adopted a data span of @xmath26  year , mjd  55900 - 56280 , which brackets the epoch the _ xmm - newton _ observation . for data reduction",
    ", the _ fermi _ science tools v9r23p1 package , available from the _ fermi _ science support center , was used .",
    "we used pass 7 data and selected events in the  source \" class ( i.e.  event class 2 ) only .",
    "in addition , we excluded the events with zenith angles larger than 100@xmath27 to greatly reduce the contamination by earth albedo @xmath1-rays . for determining pulse times of arrivals ( toas ) , we firstly constructed a template based on the timing model reported by ray et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with the method of gaussian kernal density estimation . by cross - correlating the template with unbinned geocentered data , which each photon assigned with a phase in accordance with the model reported by ray et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we measured the toas from 25 segments of adopted data span .    using tempo2 , we fitted the toas to a timing model including @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "all spin parameters are allowed to be free with the high order derivatives to account for most of the red noise .",
    "for the position , as the short data span does not allow a fit , we fixed it at the x - ray position determined by _ chandra _ throughout the analysis ( weisskopf et al .",
    "the results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "since the high order frequency derivatives are dominated by the timing noise , we stress that their values do not reflect the intrinsic rotational properties of the pulsar . using the parameters in tab .  1 , the extrapolated @xmath28 and @xmath29 are consistent with the ephemeris at the specified epochs reported by earlier literatures within the statistical uncertainties . according to this local ephemeris , the spin frequency of psr  j2021 + 4026  at the start of the good time interval ( mjd  56028.31153 ) of our _ xmm - newton _ observation is 3.768993208(2 )  hz , which is consistent with the detected x - ray pulsation ( i.e. @xmath32  hz ) .",

    "1 ) with the epoch zero at mjd  56028 . for further examining the properties of the x - ray pulsation , we performed the energy - resolved timing analysis by dividing the x - ray data into three consecutive bands : 0.150.7  kev ( soft ) , 0.72  kev ( medium ) and 212  kev ( hard ) .",
    "the phase - aligned pulse profiles at different energy ranges are shown in fig .",
    "apparently , the x - ray pulsation is most significant in the medium band ( @xmath41 ) . in the hard band",
    ", there is a very marginal pulse detection of @xmath42 .",
    "however , this corresponds to a much higher random probability of @xmath43 . in the soft band",
    ", there is no conclusive evidence for the pulsation .",
    "there is a recognizable phase offset between the @xmath1-ray and the x - ray profiles ( see the left panel in figure  [ correlation ] ) . to quantify the phase offset",
    ", we computed the cross - correlation between these two phase - aligned light curves .",
    "the result is shown in the right panel of figure  [ correlation ] .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient attains the maximum value at a phase - lag of @xmath44 . for estimating the uncertainty of cross - correlation",
    ", we used monte carlo simulation to obtain the distribution of phase - lag .",
    "the simulated x - ray light curves were generated by the original one plus a random series of variates sampled from a gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard derivation of @xmath45 corresponds to the errors of observed folded light curve . with 10000 trials ,",
    "the standard deviation is found to be 0.024 which suggests the aforementioned phase - lag is detected at a confidence level of @xmath46 .",
    "apart from detecting the x - ray pulsation , our deep _",
    "xmm - newton _ observation is also able to place a tight constraint on the spectral properties of psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "for spectral analysis , we utilized the data obtained from all three epic cameras . with the aid of the xmmsas task _ epatplot _ , all the epic data are found to be not affected by ccd pileup .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of psr  j2021 + 4026  from circles with a radius of @xmath47 centered at its nominal x - ray position ( see  2.1 ) in mos1 , mos2 and pn cameras respectively .",
    "the background spectra were extracted from the nearby regions in the corresponding ccds , which are source - free and with sufficient size to enable a less biased sampling .",
    "the response files were generated by the xmmsas task _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. after background subtraction , we have 1159  cts collected by epic in the energy range of 0.5 - 10 kev .",
    "the photon statistic is @xmath48 times higher than that used in the spectral analysis reported by ( weisskopf et al .",
    "we grouped each spectrum dynamically so as to achieve the same signal - to - noise ratio in each dataset . in order to tightly constrain the spectral parameters , we fitted the data obtained from three cameras simultaneously with xspec 12.6.0 .",
    "for a conservative estimation of uncertainties , the quoted errors of the spectral parameters are @xmath45 for 2 parameter of interest ( i.e. @xmath49 above the minimum ) for the single component models and @xmath45 for 4 parameter of interest ( i.e. @xmath50 above the minimum ) for the multi - component models .    with the tested single component models",
    ", we found that the pulsar spectrum can not be appropriately described by these simple scenarios .",
    "for the absorbed blackbody , it results in a relatively poor goodness - of - fit ( @xmath51 for 46 d.o.f . ) . on the other hand , although the absorbed power - law model results in an acceptable goodness - of - fit ( @xmath52 for 46 d.o.f . ) , it yields a very large photon index ( @xmath53 ) which is far steeper than that expected for a pulsar ( cf .",
    "cheng & zhang 1999 ) . in both of these single component fits , systematic deviations have been noted in the fitting residuals for the energies larger than @xmath54  kev .",
    "all these suggest the x - ray emission of psr  j2021 + 4026  might consist of more than one spectral component .    we proceeded to examine the spectrum with multi - component models .",
    "we found that the blackbody plus power - law model ( bb+pl ) can describe the data reasonably well ( @xmath55 for 44 d.o.f . ) .",
    "it yields a column density of @xmath56  cm@xmath35 , a temperature of @xmath58  kev , a blackbody emitting region with a radius of @xmath59  m , a photon index of @xmath60 and a normalization for the power - law component at 1 kev of @xmath61  photons",
    "kev@xmath6  cm@xmath35  s@xmath6 , where @xmath62 represents the distance to psr  j2021 + 4026  in unit of 1.5  kpc . the best - fit bb+pl model and the residuals for the x - ray spectrum of psr  j2021 + 4026  are shown in figure  [ psr_spec ] .",
    "on the other hand , a pure thermal scenario consists of two blackbody components ( bb+bb ) also results in a comparable goodness - of - fit ( @xmath63 for 44 d.o.f . ) .",
    "it yields a set of best - fit parameters of @xmath64  cm@xmath35 , @xmath65  kev , @xmath66  m , @xmath67  kev and @xmath68  m. both of these composite models imply an unabsorbed flux at the level of @xmath69  ergs  cm@xmath35  s@xmath6 .",
    "in this letter , we report our detection of x - ray pulsation from 2xmm  j202131.0 + 402645 .",
    "the detected spin frequency is consistent with the @xmath1-ray pulsation of psr  j2021 + 4026  at the same epoch .",
    "this provides a clear evidence that the observed x - rays are indeed from psr  j2021 + 4026 . the x - ray pulse profile in 0.7 - 2",
    "kev resembles the modulation resulted from a rotating neutron star with a hot spot on the stellar surface sweeps across our line - of - sight ( e.g. hui & cheng 2004 ; pechenick et al .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario inferred from the phase - averaged spectral analysis which favors a model of blackbody plus power - law or a composite blackbody model . in both of these best - fit models ,",
    "a blackbody component with a temperature of @xmath70  kev is required . at a distance of 1.5  kpc ,",
    "the best - fit blackbody radius is found to be @xmath71  km .",
    "this is comparable with the canonical size of a polar cap , @xmath72  m , where @xmath73  km represents the typical radius of a neutron star and @xmath74 is the angular frequency of psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "according to the outer gap model ( takata , cheng , & taam 2012 ; cheng & zhang 1999 ) , the temperature of the polar cap heated by the return current injected by the gap is @xmath75  kev which is also consistent with the observed value .",
    "furthermore , this spectral component contributes @xmath76 in the observed flux in both bb+pl and bb+bb fits in 0.7 - 2  kev .",
    "all these results point to the thermal nature of the observed x - ray pulsation .    in the bb+pl fit ,",
    "the non - thermal component with a photon index of @xmath77 is typical for a canonical pulsar .",
    "one possible origin of these non - thermal x - rays is the synchrotron radiation of the relativistic @xmath78 from the outer magnetospheric gap ( cheng & zhang 1999 ; takata et al .",
    "2006,2008 ) , which should give rise to a pulsed signal .",
    "despite the best - fit power - law component contributes @xmath79 in the observed flux at the energies @xmath80  kev , the evidence for the pulsation in the hard band is marginal .",
    "this suggested the pl component might be non - pulsed in nature , which can possibly be originated from a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "indeed , a putative bow - shock associated with psr  j2021 + 4026  has been marginally resolved by a _",
    "observation ( weisskopf et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it might contribute an steady unpulsed non - thermal x - ray emission as a dc level which can be found in all rotational phases .",
    "on the other hand , the bb+bb model is also able to fit the observed data with a comparable goodness - of - fit .",
    "while the low temperature component is consistent with that inferred in the bb+pl fit , it also requires a hotter component with a much smaller emitting area with a radius of few meters .",
    "this might be a phenomenological two - steps adaptation for a wider temperature distribution of the hot polar cap with the hotter component describing the peak of the distribution .",
    "the marginal detection of x - ray pulsation in the hard band might be originated from the modulation of this component .",
    "however , the inferred temperature , @xmath81  k , is higher than that expected from the heating by the back flow current from the outer gap ( cheng & zhang 1999 ) unless the surface multipolar magnetic field is strong enough to reduce the pure dipolar cap area .    comparing the phase - aligned x - ray and",
    "@xmath1-ray light curves ( fig .",
    "[ pfxg ] ) , their pulse morphologies are clearly different where the @xmath1-ray profile is narrower and contains at least two peaks . in cross - correlating these two profiles , the cross - correlation coefficient is found to attain the maximum value of @xmath82 at a phase lag of @xmath83 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ correlation ] .",
    "this clearly indicates that the observed x - rays and @xmath1-rays are originated from different sites . by comparing these observed results with the model predictions",
    ", the pulsar emission geometry ( e.g. magnetic inclination angle , viewing angle ) can be constrained . in the previous study ,",
    "trepl et al . (",
    "2010 ) has modelled the @xmath1-ray pulse profile of psr  j2021 + 4026  in the context of the outer gap model .",
    "nevertheless , due to the lack of pulses detected in radio and any other wavelength at that time , there was an uncertainty in determining which peak is leading ( see fig .",
    "13 & 14 in trepl et al . 2010 ) . with our detection of x - ray pulsation , such ambiguity can now be resolved and thus the theoretical investigation of this pulsar can be re - visited .",
