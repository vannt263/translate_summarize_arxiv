    "in recent years , several studies have revealed the existence of multiple stellar populations with different chemical compositions in all globular clusters ( gcs ) studied to date ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review and extensive references ) . in this context , the o - na anticorrelation is one of the most persistent features observed in gcs , and has been ( along with the mg - al anticorrelation ) associated to different star formation episodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "broadly speaking , it is believed that the first generation of stars of a gc is typically o - rich and na - poor , but after massive @xcite and/or intermediate - mass stars @xcite eject processed material that is mixed with pristine gas , a second generation of stars is formed with an o - poor and na - rich chemical composition @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the evidence that the o - na anticorrelation is present down to the turn - off point and main - sequence loci @xcite , thus ruling out the possibility that these chemical patterns may be ascribed to internal mixing in the individual stars themselves .    with the discovery of the multiple main sequences in @xmath2  centauri ( ngc  5139 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc  2808 @xcite , the inclusion of the initial helium abundance ( @xmath0 ) as a free parameter in low - mass stellar evolutionary calculations has again become popular , since variations in the helium abundance , due to its well - known impact upon main - sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can produce the observed split main sequence loci ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from a nuclear astrophysics perspective",
    ", such he abundance variations appear rather appealing , since the o - na and mg - al variations occur naturally in the process of proton - capture nucleosynthesis , even though   importantly   the actual level of accompanying he enhancement remains unclear at present ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review and references ) .",
    "apart from the main sequence , he abundance variations also lead to changes that can be observed along the whole color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most important effects induced by an increase in @xmath0 is observed at the horizontal branch ( hb ) , where   for a given increase in @xmath0   the luminosities of red and blue hb stars ( hereafter rhb and bhb stars , respectively ) increase , while the luminosities of the extreme blue hb ( ebhb ) stars decrease .",
    "however , the level of he enrichment is not expected to be uniform all along the hb .",
    "due to the fact that helium - rich stars evolve more rapidly than their low-@xmath0 counterparts , and thus have lower masses for a given gc age , it is expected that he - enriched stars will be located at a bluer hb location than he-``normal '' ones , on average . with this in mind , chemically anomalous stars ( e.g. , o - poor , na - rich , and possibly he - rich ) may be located at the bhb for metal - intermediate gcs , as is predicted by the multiple formation episodes scenario . if so , and as a consequence of the significant dependence of hb luminosity on @xmath0 , these bhb stars will also be significantly brighter than the ( presumably o - rich , na - poor , he-``normal '' ) rhb stars in the same cluster .    even though theoretical simulations have shown that these chemical variations in the light element ( e.g. , o - na and mg - al ) can exist in stars formed with material previously processed by the primordial generation of stars plus pristine gas , the amount of he in these new formed stars depends on several parameters as the initial mass of the donors , the amount of pristine gas , and , if this gas is accreted from outside the gc , the time when the accretion process starts , among other factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , and as noted by the referee , figure  8 in @xcite reveals that an appropriate and dynamically reasonable combination of star formation and dilution of pristine gas with material ejected by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and super - agb stars allows to build up a second generation in a gc such as m4 ( ngc  6121 ) with a small increase in helium with respect to the first generation .",
    "unfortunately , the initial helium abundances of most gc stars can not be measured spectroscopically , due to the absence of photospheric helium absorption lines at temperatures lower than 8000  k. for this reason , only the surface helium abundances of bhb and ebhb stars can be directly measured .",
    "stars hotter than the so - called `` grundahl jump '' @xcite , however , are dramatically affected by helium diffusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and so only hb stars in the relatively narrow temperature range @xmath3 \\lesssim 11\\,500 $ ] can have photospheric he abundances measured that can be more or less directly traced to the star s initial helium abundance . even in this case , however ,",
    "caution must also be exercised , since   as is well known   canonical stellar models predict an increase in the surface helium abundance ( @xmath4 ) of stars after the so - called first dredge - up episode on the red giant branch ( rgb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which however may be partly compensated for by the action of helium diffusion on the main sequence @xcite .",
    "non - canonical effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may also play a role in defining the actual difference between @xmath0 and @xmath4 on the upper rgb and hb phases .    in the particular case of m4 , a metal - intermediate gc ,",
    "the chemical peculiarities observed along the rgb ( @xcite [ hereafter m08 ] , @xcite ; and references therein ) and hb ( * ? ? ? * hereafter m11 ) support the hypothesis of several formation episodes inside this gc .",
    "in particular , these studies associate the rhb component to the cluster s first population and the bhb component to the second one , since rhb stars are found to be o - rich and na - poor while bhb stars are na - rich and o - poor .",
    "what about their corresponding he abundance levels ?    while it is impossible to directly measure the photospheric he abundances of rhb stars , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter v12 ) have carried out high - resolution spectroscopy of m4 stars using uves on eso s vlt2 , which allowed them to estimate photospheric helium abundances for 6 bhb stars with temperatures lower than 9500  k. based on those measurements , and on an analysis of the positions of the stars on a cmd , the authors have concluded that m4 s bhb component has a relatively large level of he enhancement , compared with rhb stars in the same cluster  ",
    "namely , @xmath5 .    while the presence of significant he enrichment among m4 s bhb stars may seem like a natural result , to some extent it may also be seen as somewhat surprising .",
    "in particular , as already stated , feasible scenarios do exist that provide but a minor level of he enhancement for m4 @xcite , and so a large @xmath6 for this cluster is not a foregone conclusion .",
    "comparison with the case of m3 ( ngc  5272 ) may also offer some hints in this regard @xcite .",
    "m3 , like m4 , also possesses well - developed rhb and bhb components .",
    "both clusters have nearly the same masses , to within the errors @xcite , and the difference in metallicity between them does not exceed 0.4  dex @xcite . yet , according to the high - resolution spectroscopic measurements carried out by @xcite for a large sample of rgb stars in m3 , this cluster   unlike m4   contains a substantial population of `` super - oxygen - poor '' stars , i.e. , stars which have undergone very extensive levels of oxygen processing , as revealed by their @xmath7 < 0 $ ] .",
    "one consequence of this fact is that the interquartile range ( iqr ) of the [ na / o ] distribution is significantly higher in m3 than it is in m4 ( i.e. , 0.599 vs. 0.373 ; @xcite ) .",
    "* their fig .",
    "28 ) have recently suggested a possible correlation between the level of he enhancement @xmath6 and the iqr parameter , in the sense that gcs with lower iqr values should have smaller @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the measured light - element abundance patterns would favor a lower @xmath6 for m4 than for m3 .",
    "what constraints does this set on the _ absolute _ @xmath6 values for m4 ?",
    "for m3 , according to ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter c09 ) , the level of he enhancement is at most very modest , namely @xmath1   except perhaps for the hottest @xmath8 among m3 s hb stars .",
    "value among m3 s bhb stars than found in c09 .",
    "their analysis is based on near - uv observations , but for the relevant temperatures the visual bandpasses of the strmgren and johnson filter systems ( as used in c09 and the present study , respectively ) have a much more straightforward interpretation , since they are largely immune from the ( age along the hb track , @xmath0 ) degeneracy that affects near - uv diagrams .",
    "we will expand on this in a forthcoming paper ( valcarce et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) . ] since the above arguments suggest that @xmath9 , we face the conclusion that @xmath6 for m4 stars should likely be @xmath10 as well .",
    "this is clearly in conflict with the v12 spectroscopic measurements .",
    "figure  [ figofey ] shows the chemical yields of single - mass agb stars ( from ventura & dantona 2009 ) , which have been suggested as potential contaminants .",
    "this figure suggests that agb stars that contribute to a super - oxygen - poor population at the metallicity of m3 may indeed supply more he to the medium than agb stars that contribute to an m4-like stellar population lacking super - oxygen - poor stars . while suggestive , this diagram is not conclusive by itself : obviously , it is very unlikely that single - mass agb stars are solely responsible for the formation of a second generation of stars . instead , in realistic chemical evolution calculations ,",
    "agb stars covering a mass range which depends on the time scale of formation of the second generation should be considered , in addition to proper dilution levels .",
    "in other words , in order to conclusively establish , in any theoretical framework , what the _ actual _ level of he enhancement in either m3 or m4 may have been , detailed models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of each cluster should be computed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this sense , as already stated , feasible scenarios do exist that provide but a minor level of he enhancement for m4 @xcite .",
    "thus , given the available evidence , it may seem difficult to accommodate the larger @xmath6 level among m4 s bhb stars suggested by v12 .",
    "therefore , independently verifying their spectroscopic results could be a worthwhile exercise .",

    "we use a method similar to the one used in c09 in the case of m3 , where evolutionary loci computed for different @xmath0 values were compared against high - precision photometric and spectroscopic observations to test for the presence of stellar populations with different helium abundances .",

    "the effects of different metallicities and initial helium abundances upon the zahb , 90ahb , and tahb loci in the color - magnitude and in the theoretical @xmath29@xmath30 diagrams were already discussed in c09 .",

    "as clearly shown by the figure , virtually all hb stars have luminosities between the theoretical zahb and 90ahb loci , in agreement with the theoretical predictions for a stellar population with a single metallicity @xmath31 and he abundance @xmath0 .",
    "the distance modulus for each filter is selected according to the normalized fraction of stars at different evolutionary phases .",

    "the corresponding normalized fractions should be around 50% , 50% , and 100% for each of these three ranges , respectively ( note that all these loci are for @xmath33 ) .",
    "finally , we visually inspect the results ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ figdistmodulus ] ) , in order to ensure that the procedure just described produced a reasonable description of the data . as a final result",
    ", the individual estimation of the distance modulus for each filter ( vertical dotted lines ) gives results that are fully consistent with @xmath38  mag , as used to set the position of the zahb loci ( red continuous lines ) in the bottom panels of figure  [ figdistmodulus ] . in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ figdistmodulus ] the same exercise was done using only the bhb stars , giving always a distance modulus that is smaller than the one obtained with rhb stars .",
    "this can be seen in the bottom panels of this figure , where the position of the zahb loci with @xmath33 using the distance modulus according to the normalized fraction of bhb stars ( red dashed lines ) is almost the same as the position of the zahb loci for @xmath39 but using the distance modulus according to the normalized fraction of rhb stars .",
    "this suggests that m4 bhb stars are on average more he - rich compared to rhb stars , but by no more than @xmath40 .",
    "if indeed there is a population of helium - enriched stars occupying m4 s bhb , it must however be mixed with a population of helium - normal stars , since not all bhb stars are brighter than the zahb locus for @xmath39 .    a further check for the presence of an internal variation in the he abundance",
    "is carried out in figure  [ figcmd ] ( _ left panels _ ) , where we compare zahb loci for different @xmath0 values with the observations . in the left panels of this figure ,",
    "we compare the photometric results with the theoretical zahb loci with @xmath32 and helium abundances from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , at intervals of @xmath23 ( continuous red lines ) .",
    "tahb , 90ahb , and mahb are not included in these plots for clarity , except for the mahb and 90ahb loci for @xmath26 ( dashed blue and dotted magenta lines ) .",
    "as can be seen , zahb loci with helium abundances greater than @xmath41 are brighter than the bulk of the blue hb stars in the cluster .",
    "accordingly , it is highly unlikely that all blue hb stars in m4 are helium - enriched at this level .",
    "this can also be observed in the bottom panels of figure [ figdistmodulus ] . of course ,",
    "since the 90ahb locus is similar in brightness to the zahb locus for @xmath42 , it is possible that a few percent of the bhb stars may have an enhancement of the initial helium abundance and be confused with evolved he-``normal '' bhb stars but the latter do appear to constitute the bulk of the sample .    in figure  8 of v12",
    "the same kind of comparison as in our figure  [ figcmd ] was carried out , using zahb loci for two initial helium abundances ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and @xmath43 .",
    "however , their adopted @xmath31 value is not consistent with the spectroscopically derived iron content of m4 , since such a @xmath31 value , for the same @xmath36 } = + 0.3 $ ] adopted previously and a @xmath26 , corresponds to an @xmath44 = -1.47 $ ] ( or @xmath45 , if @xmath19 = 0.0 $ ] is adopted instead ) , which is much lower than the @xmath11}$ ] value favored by the m08 , m11 , and v12 spectroscopic observations , namely @xmath46 .",

    "value is basically irrelevant for our purposes '' meant that adoption of a metallicity slightly _ higher _ than favored by the spectroscopic data for m3 did not alter the conclusion that there seemed to be little evidence for he enhancement among m3 s bhb stars . ]",
    "note , in addition , that adoption of too low a @xmath31 value does not allow one to simultaneously fit the rhb and rgb loci in the @xmath48 , @xmath49 plane ( _ bottom right _ panel in fig .",
    "[ figcmd ] ) , as opposed to what happens when a metallicity more closely corresponding to the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] value is used instead .    as a further check of these results , and again following c09 , in figure  [ fig_gravteff ] we compare the spectroscopic data and theoretical predictions for bhb stars in the @xmath50 plane . in this figure ,",
    "circles and squares represent the stars studied by m11 and v12 , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , 8 of the 12 bhb stars are in agreement with the theoretical predictions for a canonical helium abundance ( initial @xmath33 and surface helium abundance at the hb @xmath34 ) , 2 stars ( both from m11 ) have empirical @xmath13 values outside the canonical limits by more than their stated @xmath51 errors , and 2 stars ( both from v12 ) seem to be in an advanced evolutionary phase ( i.e. , over the 90ahb locus ) for a canonical helium value .",
    "alternatively , the latter two stars may correspond to a minority subpopulation with enhanced helium .",
    "however , only one of these stars ( i d 45025 ) has all the properties that are asociated to stars with high initial-@xmath0 : high photospheric he abundance ( @xmath52 ) , low surface gravity , high luminosities in the three filters studied here ( b , v , and i , see fig .",
    "[ figcmd ] ) , and high - na and low - o abundances .",
    "as suggested by the referee , rhb stars could in principle also be included in this figure , in order to compare their surface gravities with those obtained for bhb stars and theoretical models .",
    "unfortunately , however , these red hb stars are only studied in m11 , where the @xmath29 values have an estimated error around @xmath53  dex . for this reason ,",
    "it is impossible to obtain reliable information on the basis of these data alone .",
    "finally , it is important to note that , even though all stars in figure  [ fig_gravteff ] have na and o abundances ( @xmath54\\ge0.26 $ ] and @xmath7\\le0.29 $ ] , v12 and m11 ) related to stars presumably formed with material processed by an older generation of stars , almost all of them have surface gravities in agreement with canonical he abundances .",
    "this suggests that there is no direct relation between the o - na anticorrelation and different degrees of he abundances , or   perhaps more plausibly   that the degree of he enhancement among m4 s hb stars is too small to be reliably detected .",
    "this is not totally unexpected , since   as pointed out by @xcite   large levels of oxygen depletion ( i.e. , @xmath12 } < 0 $ ] ) may in some cases plausibly be associated with very small levels of he enhancement . in the specific case of m4 ,",
    "the levels of oxygen depletion detected spectroscopically are very small indeed ( i.e. , no stars are known with @xmath12 } \\lesssim 0.2 $ ] ) , thus making it even harder to explain the presence of significant levels of he enhancement in this cluster .",
    "in this paper , the same zahb loci test as previously carried out in c09 for m3 has been used to check if there are stars with high initial helium abundance in the gc m4 , as recently suggested .    using the cmd of this gc together with zahb loci computed for the spectroscopically derived cluster metallicity",
    ", we find that , as in the case of m3 , the level of he enhancement among most bhb stars in m4 is unlikely to be higher than @xmath23 .",
    "this is confirmed by the distribution of the stars in the @xmath50 plane , although the latter in particular can not rule out the presence of a minority subpopulation of stars with moderate levels of he enhancement being present in the cluster . together with the fact that feasible theoretical scenarios do exist that provide but a minor level of he enhancement for m4 @xcite , a reevaluation of the v12 spectroscopic he abundance measurements would probably be worthwhile .",
