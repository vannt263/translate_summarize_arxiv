    "statistical tests for the presence of changes in the structure of a time series are of great importance in a wide range of scientific discussions , e.g. regarding economic , technological and climate data .",
    "many procedures for detecting changes and for estimating change points have been proposed in the statistical literature , see e.g. csrg and horvath ( 1997 ) for a detailed exposition . in the case of independent observations with normal tails ,",
    "the theory is quite satisfactory . for a wide variety of change - point models ,",
    "many statistical procedures have been proposed and their properties have been investigated .",
    "in contrast , the situation is quite different for dependent data , such as encountered in time series models , and for heavy - tailed data . for dependent data ,",
    "most research has focused on linear procedures , such as cusum tests , and there are many open problems when it comes to other types of test procedures , e.g. those based on robust statistics .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study tests for detecting a level shift in a time series .",
    "specifically , we assume that the sequence of observations @xmath0 is generated by the model @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a sequence of unknown constants and @xmath3 is a stationary process with mean zero .",
    "we will focus on the case when @xmath3 is a weakly dependent process , in a sense that we will specify below . as examples",
    ", we will be able to treat most standard models of time series analysis , such as arma processes and garch processes , but our theory is not restricted to such concrete models .    given observations @xmath4 , we want to test the null hypothesis that the process is stationary , i.e. @xmath5 against the alternative that there is a level shift at some unknown point in time , i.e. @xmath6 note that in case the change - point @xmath7 is known in advance , the test problem becomes a standard two - sample problem , where the first sample is @xmath8 and the second sample is @xmath9 .",
    "this test problem is obviously much simpler than the change - point problem studied here . at the same time , tests for the two - sample problem often serve as guideline for finding tests for the problem of detecting a change at an unknown point in time .    the standard test statistic for the above change - point problem is the cusum statistic , which is defined as @xmath10 the asymptotic distribution of this test statistic under the null hypothesis can be derived from a functional central limit theorem for the partial sum process @xmath11 } y_i)_{0\\leq \\lambda \\leq 1}$ ] . in the case",
    "when the noise process @xmath12 is i.i.d . with finite variance ,",
    "this is donsker s invariance principle .",
    "similar results have been obtained for a wide range of short range dependent processes @xmath12 ; see e.g. ibragimov and linnik ( 1961 ) , bradley ( 2007 ) and dedecker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for various functional central limit theorems for a large class of weakly dependent processes . in this case",
    ", the partial sum process will converge in distribution to a brownian motion @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the long - run variance . as an application of the continuous mapping theorem",
    ", we thus find that @xmath15 hence we can calculate approximate critical values for the cusum test from tables of the kolmogorov - smirnov distribution , i.e. the distribution of the supremum of the brownian bridge process @xmath16 , provided we have a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance @xmath17 .",
    "such estimators have been proposed in the literature ; see e.g. dehling , fried , sharipov , vogel and wornowizki ( 2013 ) for a recent result under dependence conditions relevant for this paper .",
    "the cusum test is based on partial sums and is thus not robust to outliers in the data . in this paper",
    ", we will propose a robust alternative to the cusum test and investigate its properties .",
    "our test will be valid without any moment assumptions on the underlying data , and can thus be applied to arbitrarily heavy - tailed data . in order to motivate our test , we note that using some elementary algebra , we obtain the following alternative representation of the cusum test statistic , @xmath18 on the right hand side we have the term @xmath19 , which is the standard estimator for the difference of the expected values of the two samples @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in a gaussian two sample model of i.i.d . data .    in our paper , we propose a test that is based on the hodges - lehmann two sample estimator , in the same way that the cusum test is based on the difference of the arithmetic means of the two samples . in a classical two - sample problem with independent samples",

    "asymptotic normality of the hodges - lehmann estimator has been established under a wide range of assumptions .",
    "recently , fried and dehling ( 2011 ) explored the good robustness properties of two - sample tests based on this estimator , and dehling and fried ( 2012 ) proved its asymptotic normality in the case of short range dependent observations .",
    "we propose the hodges - lehmann change - point test statistic , which we define as @xmath23 the hodges - lehmann change - point test will reject the null hypothesis for large positive or large negative values of @xmath24 . in this paper",
    ", we will derive asymptotic distribution theory for a class of test statistics , of which the hodges - lehmann test statistic is a special example . as an application of our general results",

    "we will derive the asymptotic results in this paper under the assumption of short range dependence . in the literature",
    ", there is a wide range of notions that formally capture the idea of short range dependent processes .",
    "the classical approach is to impose mixing conditions , such as strong mixing , absolute regularity and uniform mixing , also known as @xmath61-mixing , @xmath62-mixing and @xmath63-mixing , respectively .",
    "this approach was initiated by the seminal paper of rosenblatt ( 1956 ) , where strongly mixing processes were introduced and where a central limit theorem for partial sums of strongly mixing processes was proved . for a survey of various mixing concepts and associated limit theorems for partial sums , see the monographs by doukhan ( 1994 ) and rio ( 2000 ) , as well as the encyclopedic three volume monograph by bradley ( 2007 ) .    mixing concepts provided a unifying structure that allowed establishing limit theorems for a wide range of stochastic processes , that previously could be treated only by ad hoc methods . among these processes",
    "are , e.g. arma - processes with a continuous innovation distribution , stationary ergodic markov chains , the process of digits in a continued fraction expansion . at the same time",
    "there are very important processes that are not mixing .",
    "one of the simplest examples are ar(1)-processes with discrete innovations , as was pointed out by andrews ( 1984 ) . the largest class of non - mixing processes are deterministic dynamical systems , i.e. processes defined as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a map on some state space @xmath66 and where @xmath67 is a random variable .",
    "such processes do not satisfy any of the classical mixing conditions , but yet under some assumptions on the map @xmath68 and the distribution of @xmath67 , they satisfy many of the classical limit theorems . in order to overcome these obvious shortcomings of mixing concepts , doukhan and louhichi ( 1999 ) suggested various new notions of weakly dependent processes , which are based on covariance inequalities for suitable functions of blocks of random variables that are separated in time . in their paper and in subsequent publications of various authors , a large variety of limit theorems",
    "was established for processes satisfying these notions .",
    "for a comprehensive survey , see the monograph by dedecker et al ( 2007 ) .    in the present paper ,",

    "the sizes of the different tests under the different error distributions are assessed by applying the tests with the critical value 1.36 , corresponding to an asymptotic 5% significance level , to 4000 time series without shift .",

    "the adaptive block length for the subsampling increases the power in case of small or moderate positive autocorrelations , particularly for a shift outside the center , and it stabilizes the size of the tests in case of large positive autocorrelations .",
    "note that the hle test with adaptive block length performs even better than the corresponding cusum test in case of strong positive autocorrelations .",
    "estimation of the asymptotic variance is less vulnerable to shifts in case of the hle test than for the cusum , since we deal with autocovariances of random variables which are transformed to the bounded interval @xmath157 $ ] .",

    "the asymptotic theory underlying the cusum still applies for this heavy - tailed distribution , since the variance exists .",
    "nevertheless , our implementations of the cusum test provide smaller power than the wmw and hle tests .",
    "again we find little difference between the wmw and the hle test if a shift occurs in the center of the series , and a substantial advantage of the hle test if the shift occurs outside the center .",
    "the increased power in case of small positive autocorrelations and the better size preservation in case of large positive autocorrelations resulting from the adaptive block length is also confirmed .",
    "we get similar results for the situation of @xmath159-distributed innovations , see figure [ fig : t2power ] .",
    "although the asymptotic theory underlying the cusum test does not apply , it still preserves the size if the autocorrelations are moderate , but the advantages of the wmw and even more the hle test in terms of power increase as the tails get heavier .",
    "+   +   +     +   +   +    table [ tab : sizes ] indicates that the better power of the hle test as compared to the wmw test is in part due to its size being closer to the nominal significance level .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the tests employing carlstein s adaptive choice of the block length could be improved further by using a more sophisticated estimate of @xmath161 than the sample autocorrelation coefficient applied here .",
    "the latter is positively biased in the presence of a shift , which leads to undesirably large choices of the block length .",
    "this negative effect becomes more severe for larger values of @xmath161 , since the plug - in - estimate of the asymptotically mse - optimal choice of @xmath162 increases more rapidly if @xmath163 is close to 1 , while it is rather stable for moderate and small values of @xmath163 . in our study , in case of @xmath152 the average value chosen for @xmath162 increases from about 2 to about 4 on average as the height of the shift increases , while it is from about 6 to about 10 if @xmath154 , and even from about 16 to about 24 if @xmath156 .",
    "a robust estimate of the autocorrelation coefficient resisting shifts could be used , but this is left for future research .",
    "we also considered direct estimation of the asymptotic variance after correcting the data for a possible shift as proposed by huskova and kirch ( 2010 ) , but our implementation provided substantially oversized tests .",
    "when correcting the sizes of the tests by using the empirical 95% percentile of the absolute values of the test statistics , derived from time series without a shift generated from the same model , the differences between the tests were less pronounced than those presented here .",
    "however , such a comparison is not realistic , since in practice we usually know neither the time series model nor the type of innovations and can thus not use such critical values derived from simulations . instead",
    ", bootstrap procedures might be an interesting alternative , but this will not be pursued here .",
    "for illustration of the gains in power arising from the hle test as compared to the cusum and the wmw test we analyze the monthly averages of the daily minimum temperatures in potsdam , germany , from 1893 to 2010 .",
    "the 1416 data points have been deseasonalized by subtracting the median value from each calendar month , see figure [ fig : potsdam ] .",
    "we are interested in whether the level of this data set is constant or whether there is a monotonic change .",
    "such a change is likely to show a trend - like behavior and not a jump , but nevertheless a change - point test should detect such a change if its null hypothesis is a constant level .    the empirical autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations suggest a first order autoregressive model with lag - one autocorrelation about 0.25 for the deseasonalized data .",
    "the cusum and the hle test statistics take their maximum value in 1987 after time point 1136 , while the wmw test takes it in 1943 after time point 595 , i.e. rather in the middle of the time series .",
    "the resulting p - values are 0.002 , 0.002 and below 0.001 for the cusum , the wmw and the hle test with the fixed block length .",
    "all p - values are even below 0.001 when using the adaptive block length .",
    "when dividing the data into the times periods before and after the detected change - point , the hle test with adaptive block length yields a further significant p - value of 0.042 after time point 380 in 1924 . for the hle with fixed block length and the wmw with adaptive block length the p - value is 0.062 , while the cusum test is far from being significant and does not reject the null hypothesis of constant levels within the subsequences .",
    "the multiple change - points detected by the hle test with adaptive block length might be due to a monotonic trend and can be explained by the superior power of this test in case of heavy tailed data like daily minima .",
    "the hle estimates an increase of the temperatures by @xmath164c from the first to the second and by another @xmath165c from the second to the third period .",
