    "<S> [ dc.eps ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of dielectric media , in the present plasmonic case the spp pressure and striction contributions to the emf have the same sign since @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> these two contributions are equal if a condition @xmath83 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the black solid line represents this condition ; to the left of this line the pressure dominates , and to the right the striction force gives the major contribution to the spider . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable because close to the sp resonance of the wire ( at @xmath84 ev ) , the gradient of the spp intensity increases due to the high loss : the striction force is of a gradient nature , dominating therefore . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , with the decrease of @xmath16 , the intensity gradient increases due to the increased confinement , which also leads to the relative increase of the striction with respect to the pressure force , as we clearly can see from this and other panels of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> general increase of the spider at the sp resonant frequency can be seen as a broad red peak .    </S>",

    "<S> [ dc.eps ] ( b ) as a function of the wire radius @xmath16 for a frequency of @xmath85 ev . the spider effect is gigantically enhanced for strong nanoplasmonic confinement : by four orders of magnitude when @xmath16 decreases from 100 to 5 nm at the same spp power . </S>",
    "<S> there is a pronounced scaling @xmath86 at @xmath87 , in accord with the discussion following eq . </S>",

    "<S> [ dc.eps](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the magnitude of the emf in this case is very large , from 0.01 to 10 v per 1 w of the spp pulse power , in the entire optical range , with a pronounced resonance at the sp frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this large magnitude shows that the spider effect can be used for the photodetection on the nanoscale , i.e. , in the role that previously was deemed only available for semiconductors . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , it belongs to the area of the active nanoplasmonics.@xcite    by classification of the nonlinear optics , the spider is an optical second - order nonlinear effect : the magnitude of the spider emf @xmath25 is proportional to the power @xmath22 of the spp field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the maximum achievable magnitude of the emf is determined by the maximum @xmath22 that the wire can tolerate . </S>",
    "<S> this we estimate setting the optical field @xmath89 at the surface of the wire equal to 1 v /  . for fields </S>",
    "<S> significantly higher than this , there will be massive ionization and damage of the metal surface . </S>",
    "<S> we plot in fig.[dc.eps ] ( d ) this maximum intensity as a function of the wire radius for three spp frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> note a very good scaling @xmath90 in the region @xmath87 of the strong nanoplasmonic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> these values of the @xmath33 in comparison to the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dc.eps ] ( a)-(c ) show that the gigantic values of of the spider emf @xmath91 v are realistically achievable , which are many orders of magnitude greater than observed previously in the metal films .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important for applications properties of the giant spider is high local electric field @xmath30 generated due to the spider optical rectification in the vicinity of the nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> such a field ( averaged over the spp decay length @xmath92 ) can be found as @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we display the maximum achievable rectified field @xmath32 ( at the propagating spp power of @xmath33 ) in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dc.eps ] ( e ) , ( f ) . as we see from panel ( e ) , the spectral dependence of the spider rectified thz field is very similar for all wire sizes , but the magnitude of this field is much greater for the 5 nm wire : @xmath94 v / cm . </S>",
    "<S> the nanolocalized thz fields of such a magnitude will excite a wealth of nonlinear thz responses at the nanoscale .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider dynamics of the emf response to spp pulses that differ in duration @xmath68 with respect to the the spp pulse dissipation time @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is displayed in fig.[pulses.eps ] ( a ) as a function of the frequency @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see time @xmath71 is in the range from 10 to 150 fs . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal dependencies of the emf in comparison with the power @xmath22 of the spp pulses for various pulse durations is illustrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pulses.eps ] ( b)-(d ) . for a relatively long pulse ( @xmath95 ) shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pulses.eps ] ( b ) , the shape of the emf @xmath96 repeats that of the power @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this relatively long , picosecond response , nevertheless , corresponds to a 1 thz bandwidth for this nanowire used as a nanoscale photodetector . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) the time dependence of the emf @xmath96 ( green line , left scale ) and input power @xmath74 ( red line , right scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse duration is @xmath101 and the emf closely follows the spp pulse dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the same for much shorter pulse with @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - induced emf leads to small broadening in emf dynamics ( green line ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ pulses.eps ] ( c ) , there is a small broadening and delay of the voltaic response ( emf ) @xmath96 with respect to the excitation spp pulse @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening is due to the pressure force that decays exponentially for long times , as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ func ] ) of the methods section suggests , and the broken blue line in the figure indicates . </S>",
    "<S> however , under the conditions considered , this delay and broadening are not large . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency - response bandwidth of this wire as an spp photodetector on the nanoscale is very large , @xmath107 thz , which is characteristic of the extreme nanoplasmonic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the spider emf is also very large , @xmath91 v.    for a much thicker nanowire of @xmath108 nm ( weak plasmonic confinement case ) and @xmath109 ev , illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pulses.eps ] ( d ) , the spp decay time becomes much longer ( @xmath110 fs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a very significant delay and temporal broadening of the emf response with a pronounced exponential part due to the pressure forces shown by the broken blue line . </S>",
    "<S> these behavior is due to the much longer spp lifetimes for the weak confinement where a significant fraction of the spp energy propagates in the dielectric ( vacuum ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the emf response bandwidth is still very large , on the order of 5 thz , and its amplitude is also very large , @xmath111 v.    in conclusion , the ultrafast giant spider in metal nanowires excited by ultrashort spp pulses is predicted in this letter to generate a gigantic emf up to @xmath4 v for the spp waves of realistic and tolerable amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the spider enhancement is mostly nonresonant , due to nanoplasmonic confinement of the spp fields , which leads to higher gradients of the fields and their higher magnitudes . because of its nonresonant nature </S>",
    "<S> , the spider is an extremely fast effect : frequency bandwidth of the generated thz fields is realistically 5 - 20 thz . due to high longitudinal localization of the spp waves in the case of the strong nanoplasmonic confinement , the spider generates very high local thz electric fields at the metal surface , @xmath112 v / cm . </S>",
    "<S> such fields are capable of inducing strongly nonlinear responses , including dissociation of molecules . among possible applications of the giant spider </S>",
    "<S> are rectification and detection of the nanoscale femtosecond optical fields , coupling of the nanoplasmonic elements to semiconductor devices , nonlinear thz spectroscopy on the nanoscale of chemical and biological nanoobjects for biomedicine , etc .    </S>",
