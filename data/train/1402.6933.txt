    "in recent years , we have seen an exponential growth of the interest in low dimensional forms of carbon , such as carbon nanotubes @xcite or graphene .",
    "@xcite both structures are closely related to graphite , whose upper surface has proved itself a good adsorbent for quantum gases .",
    "@xcite one of the ( sometimes unstated ) goals of the experimental studies of quantum gases ( particularly h@xmath0 ) on relatively weak substrates ( such as graphene versus graphite ) is to find novel quasi two dimensional stable phases , for instance , a liquid h@xmath0 ( or he ) superfluid film all the way to t=0 k. since this hope has not been fulfilled so far , new substrates have been searched to be tested .",
    "one of those new two dimensional substrates is called graphane , an hydrogenated version of graphene predicted to be stable  @xcite , and one of whose forms ( c - graphane ) has been experimentally obtained  @xcite . in c",
    "- graphane , every carbon atom is covalently bound to three other atoms of the same type , and to an hydrogen atom that sticks out perpendicularly from the two - dimensional carbon scaffolding .",
    "neighboring carbons have their bound hydrogens pointing to opposite sides of the carbon structure .",
    "hydrogen atoms on the same side of the carbon structure are exactly on the same plane , something that it is not true of all the atoms in the carbon skeleton .",
    "therefore , the upper solid substrate ( the sheet of atomic hydrogen ) is less dense than in the graphene case .",
    "it has also a different symmetry : h atoms form a triangular lattice instead of the hexagonal one characteristic of graphene and graphite .",
    "however , the underlying carbon structure , whose symmetry is still hexagonal , is close enough to the atomic hydrogen surface to exert a sizeable influence ( the c - h length is @xmath3 1  ) on any possible adsorbate . in any case , this novel substrate is different enough to graphite and graphene as to have been already considered as an adsorbent for helium @xcite and h@xmath0 @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "computer simulations predicted the ground state of @xmath4he to be a liquid , not a commensurate solid as in the case of graphene and graphite @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase diagram of h@xmath0 on c - graphane is similar to those calculated for graphene @xcite , and found experimentally on graphite @xcite . in all three cases ,",
    "the h@xmath0 ground state is a standard @xmath5 solid .    in this work ,",
    "we determine the phase diagram of d@xmath0 physisorbed on top of c - graphane .",
    "the phase diagram of d@xmath0 on graphene and graphite has already been calculated @xcite , and found to contain different phases that those of h@xmath0 on the same substrates .",
    "the accuracy of the results on graphite compares favorably against experimental results @xcite .",
    "then , we used similar theoretical tools with d@xmath0 on graphane , to see if we can found significant enough differences between the results obtained and those on h@xmath0 on graphane @xcite and d@xmath0 on graphene @xcite . in the next section , we will describe the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method used to obtain the @xmath6k equilibrium phases of d@xmath0 , giving all the necessary information to perform the quantum calculations .",
    "the results obtained will presented in section iii , and we will end up with the some conclusions in section iv .",
    "the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method allows us to obtain the exact ground - state properties of a many - body bose system , such as a set of _ ortho_-d@xmath0 molecules adsorbed on c - graphane .",
    "it allows us to solve stochastically the @xmath7-body schrdinger equation in imaginary time by implementing a random walk with gaussian and drift movements and a weighting scheme called branching .",
    "the drift term derives from the introduction of an importance sampling strategy through a guiding wave function @xmath8 ( the so - called _ trial function _ ) , which avoids the sampling of walkers in low - probability regions .",
    "proceeding in this way , the variance is reduced significantly without affecting the exactness of the results .",
    "@xcite in practice , the guiding function is also used to set the thermodynamic phase of the ensemble of particles .",
    "we will consider here a liquid phase and several solid arrangements ( commensurate or incommensurate with the substrate underneath ) .",
    "for the study of the liquid phase we used as a _ trial function _ :",
    "@xmath9 \\prod_i \\phi({\\bf r}_i ) \\ ,   \\label{trial1}\\ ] ] where the first term is a jastrow wave function that depends on the distances @xmath10 between each pair of d@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the one - body term @xmath11 is the result of solving numerically the three - dimensional schrdinger equation for a molecule interacting with all the individual atoms of the graphane surface . in figure",
    "[ cuts ] we plotted a xy - plane cut of both the c - d@xmath0 potential close to the potential minimum and the corresponding value for the one - body part of the _ trial function_. during the monte carlo simulations , instead of recalculating analytically both potential and wave function each time the position of particle * r*@xmath12 changes , we tabulated @xmath13 using a grid and then interpolated linearly for the desired values .",
    "since the graphane structure is a quasi two - dimensional solid , it was enough to consider only the minimum units that can be replicated in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions to produce the corresponding infinite sheet . in our case , these units contained eight atoms ( four carbons and four hydrogens ) each , and were chosen to be rectangular instead of the smaller oblique cells deduced directly from the symmetry of the compounds .",
    "@xcite the dimensions of this basic unit are 2.5337 @xmath16 4.3889 @xmath17 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the dimensions of a similar rectangular cell for graphene are 2.4595 @xmath16 4.26 @xmath17 .",
    "the transverse displacement between neighboring carbon atoms in the graphane structure was @xmath18  , in agreement with @xcite . if the position of any deuterium molecule in the simulation cell is located outside that minimum cell , the value of the function @xmath19 is obtained by projecting back that position within those cell limits .",
    "the grid to calculate @xmath19 extended up to 12    in the @xmath20 direction from the positions of the upper carbons .",
    "+    the @xmath21 parameters of the corresponding jastrow functions that appear in ( [ trial1 ] ) were obtained from variational monte carlo calculations that included ten deuterium molecules on a c - graphane simulation cell of dimensions 35.47 @xmath16 35.11 @xmath22 .",
    "this is a 14@xmath168 supercell of the basic unit defined above .",
    "the optimal value is @xmath21= 3.195  , exactly the same number as the one used for graphene in previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "some other tests made for different deuterium densities left the parameter unchanged .    to simulate solid deuterium phases , we multiplied @xmath23 ( [ trial1 ] ) by a product of gaussian functions whose role is to confine the adsorbate molecules around the crystallographic positions ( @xmath24 ) of the two dimensional solids we are interested in .",

    "the variationally optimized values for @xmath26 are given in table [ c ] .",
    "for the triangular incommensurate structures , the values listed are the ones for densities @xmath27 = 0.11 @xmath28 and @xmath29 0.08 @xmath28 .",

    "we calculated the phase diagram of d@xmath0 on c - graphane , a novel substance that has been experimentally realized .",
    "both the structure of the compound and all the interactions between the different parts of the system were taken to be as much realistic as possible .",
    "this means that the results of our work could be checked against experimental data in the future .",
    "the fact that both the stable phases and their density limits were unchanged by modifications of the surface - deuterium interaction potentials makes us confident in the reliability of the method and in our conclusions .",
    "since we have no experimental data to compare to , we can not reach any conclusion about the deuterium adsorption energies . in this , we are at disadvantage with the case of graphene , for which we do not have experimental data either , but whose energies could be compared to those of graphite , a close related compound .",
    "our results also indicate that the ground state of deuterium adsorbed on graphane is the registered phase @xmath1 , what makes d@xmath0 on graphane different from h@xmath0 on graphane @xcite , or from d@xmath0 or any other quantum gas on graphene @xcite , where the ground states were @xmath5 arrangements .",
    "this is also at odds with some recent results for @xmath4he on graphane .",
    "@xcite those indicate that the ground state of @xmath4he on graphane was a liquid , and that a registered phase analogous to the @xmath36 structure was also stable .",
    "we did not found that the energy per molecule of that phase were appreciably different than the corresponding to an incommensurate triangular phase of the same density for d@xmath0 . in any case",
