    "various angular functions , including scalar , vector , and tensor spherical harmonics , are used to perform separation of variables in the general relativity literature .",
    "these functions include the regge - wheeler harmonics , the symmetric , trace - free tensors of sachs and pirani , the newman - penrose spin - weighted spherical harmonics , and the mathews - zerilli clebsch - gordan - coupled harmonics .",
    "an excellent review article by thorne @xcite lists all of these functions and discusses their mutual relations .",
    "the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath0 @xcite are most commonly used to separate the angular dependence of the gravitational radiation emitted as a result of compact binary mergers and gravitational collapse in numerical relativity simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath8 s are not ideal to study the perturbations of the rotating kerr black holes of mass @xmath9 and dimensionless angular momentum @xmath10 that may be formed as a result of compact binary mergers or gravitational collapse ( here and below @xmath11 is the usual kerr parameter , and we use geometrical units : @xmath12 ) .",
    "teukolsky @xcite first realized that the radiation produced by perturbed kerr black holes is most conveniently studied using a different set of angular functions : the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics @xmath13 ( henceforth swshs ) .",
    "the differential equation defining these functions is a generalized spheroidal wave equation @xcite , and it results from separating variables in the partial differential equations describing the propagation of a spin-@xmath1 field in a rotating ( kerr ) black hole background .",
    "if we use the kinnersley tetrad and boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath14 , we assume a time dependence of the form @xmath15 and a @xmath16-dependence of the form @xmath17 , the swshs satisfy the equation @xcite [ angularwaveeq ] & & _ , x + & + & _",
    "ss_m=0,where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the boyer - lindquist polar angle .",
    "the angular separation constant @xmath21 is , in general , complex .",
    "the spin - weight parameter takes on the values @xmath22 for massless scalar , spinor , vector and tensor perturbations , respectively .",

    "this paper was mainly motivated by recent investigations of spherical - spheroidal mode mixing in black - hole binary mergers @xcite .",
    "for this reason our analysis was limited to four - dimensional swshs and low - order overtones . despite these limitations",
    ", we expect the `` dictionary '' developed in this paper to be useful in several applications of black hole perturbation theory , including the construction of phenomenological models of black - hole mergers , studies of green s functions in black - hole backgrounds , self - force investigations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and calculations of hawking radiation .    it would be interesting to extend our work to higher overtones , that may have some relation with black - hole area quantization ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or @xcite for reviews )",
    ". it would also be useful to investigate mixing coefficients for higher - dimensional spheroidal harmonics , that are of interest for the phenomenology of black - hole formation in high - energy particle collisions @xcite and to assess the stability of higher - dimensional rotating black holes @xcite .",
    "furthermore our analysis was limited to spin values that are not very close to @xmath23 , and it calls for a more careful investigation of the nearly extremal regime , where a bifurcation of the spectrum can occur @xcite and lead to turbulent behavior @xcite .",
    "the numerical data and fitting coefficients computed in this paper are publicly available for download @xcite .",
    "the webpage includes also spherical - spheroidal mixing coefficients for swshs with @xmath24 and @xmath3 , that were not reported in this paper because they are qualitatively similar to the data for spin weight @xmath25 .",
    "we are grateful to michalis agathos , riccardo sturani , scott hughes , alessandra buonanno , andrea taracchini , gaurav khanna and sebastiano bernuzzi for correspondence and conversations that stimulated our interest in this problem .",
    "this research was supported by nsf career grant no .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the swsh equation can be solved via an expansion in powers of @xmath26 using standard perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath27 the solutions are ordinary spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xcite .",
