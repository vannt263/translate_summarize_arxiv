    "the study on the transport property of copper has been attracting much attentions of researchers@xcite since it often serves as a good conductor in devices either on macro or micro scales , such as the interconnect material of integrated circuits ( ic ) .",
    "reducing resistivity is highly demanded in ic technology to cut down the power consumption of micro - devices .",
    "effort should be made to reach this goal theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it was found that the decreasing cross section of cu wire would lead to the increase of the resistivity@xcite , which is the so called  size effect \" .",
    "it may give rise to @xmath0 increase in the resistivity when the size of the sample is below 50  nm.@xcite this effect severely impacts the time delay of the interconnects of integrated circuits and thus represents a major challenge for the continuing evolution of the microelectronic devices .",
    "actually , the size effect is related to the increasing surface to bulk atomic number when the dimension of the cross section of thin films decreases to nanometer scale .",
    "furthermore , experimental observations revealed that there was about @xmath1 contraction of the top - layer for cu films when @xmath2 , and @xmath3 when @xmath4.@xcite generally , the total resistivity of cu interconnect origins from several scattering mechanisms , including lattice vibrations , impurities , defects , surface roughness and grain boundaries , _ etc_. surface scattering is considered to play a key role in the increase in the resistivity of copper thin films.@xcite therefore , investigating the influence of the surface structure and its vibration mode on the resistivity , i.e. the effect of the surface electron - phonon interaction , is a very important topic .",
    "many methods have been advanced to study the effect of the surface electron - phonon scattering on the resistivity .",
    "a widely used semiclassical model is the fuchs - sondheimer model,@xcite where a phenomenological parameter is used to characterize the electron scattering at the surface .",
    "other more advanced analytic models@xcite have also been proposed in the general area of the thin - film resistivity , which take into account the quantum effects that may become prominent at very small film thickness .",
    "recently , parameters free _ ab initio _ methods@xcite have been used to directly calculate the resistivity of cu films and nanowires , where a supercell approach was employed on periodic atomic structures . in an earlier work@xcite",
    ", we have developed an approach based upon a tight - binding muffin - tin - orbital implementation of the landauer - bttiker formulation of transport theory within the local - spin - density approximation of density - functional theory .",
    "it was used to calculate the resistivity due to diluted impurities in alloys@xcite and good agreement with experiment@xcite was obtained .",
    "unfortunately the code works only for occasions at zero temperature . in the current work , however , we are interested in the finite temperature effect of the surface electron - phonon scattering on the resistivity of thin films .",
    "therefore the approach should be revised to include the thermal effect .",
    "it is achieved in this paper by sampling the disordered atomic configurations due to thermal vibration in the scattering region according to gaussian distributions , where the temperature dependent mean - square amplitudes are estimated by the debye model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we describe the atomic structure of cu films , the determination of the atomic displacements due to thermal vibration , and the computational method .",
    "the temperature dependent resistivity of the bulk and the film structures of copper are presented and discussed in sec .  [ section3 ] .",
    "a short summary is made in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] .",
    "the geometry structure of the system studied in the current work is shown in fig .",
    "it consists of three parts , i.e. the two contacts regions denoted respectively by l and r , and a scattering region denoted by m. the l and r regions are cu metals with perfect fcc structure , and the lattice constant @xmath5 is set to @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 axes are along @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the thickness of the cu film .",
    "the atomic structure is assumed to be a perfect crystal in the scattering region when the temperature is @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ geo](a ) ) . for finite temperature ,",
    "the atoms deviate from their equilibrium positions due to thermal vibration ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ geo](b ) ) , which can be simulated by random displacements.@xcite actually , the temperature dependence of the mean - square displacement has been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite here we introduce it by a simple argument based upon the debye model .",
    "( color online ) the atomic structure of cu film consisting of two lead regions ( denoted by l and r ) and one scattering region ( denoted by m ) .",
    "( a ) for @xmath15 , no disorder in the scattering region , except for the quantum fluctuation of lattice ; ( b ) for @xmath16 , the atoms in scattering region violate the perfect crystal structure.,width=288 ]    in the language of phonon , the lattice vibrations is described by the linear combination of collective oscillations with different frequencies .",
    "the energy of each atom contributed by one collective mode with frequency @xmath17 can be represented as @xmath18 in average , which gives the square of atomic vibration amplitude @xmath19 with the single atom mass @xmath20 . on the other hand , the total energy @xmath21 in equation ( [ amplitude ] )",
    "can be estimated from the statistical average of phonon number @xmath22 @xmath23 from the planck distribution@xmath24 .",
    "we further assume that the frequency distribution of the collective oscillations obeys the debye model , and thus the mean - square amplitude can be expressed by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the debye frequency , and @xmath27 is the density of state for phonons . for our case",
    ", we have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the sound velocity in the system .",
    "finally , we get the analytic expression for the mean - square amplitude , i.e. @xmath30\\label{amplitude1},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the deybe temperature , and @xmath32 .",
    "now , the mean - square vibrational amplitudes @xmath33 of the system at finite temperature can be calculated through equation ( [ amplitude1 ] ) , and the atomic positions in the scattering region in fig .",
    "[ geo](b ) can thus be determined through the random displacements satisfying the gaussian distribution @xmath34 , with the mean - square displacement @xmath35 . here , our approach to describe the lattice vibration is more suitable for weakly correlated atoms , and is a rough approximation for the calculations blow .",
    "the transport property of the system is estimated by the first principle method developed in the previous works.@xcite in this approach , the electron structure is calculated through the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital method , where the atomic sphere potentials in scattering region are determined by the self - consistent calculations based upon the green s function technique .",
    "the conductance is calculated by the landauer - bttiker formulism , and the resistivity is expressed explicitly in terms of the transmission matrix @xmath36 as@xcite @xmath37.\\label{schepform}\\ ] ] here , @xmath38 is the interface area and @xmath39 is the length of the lateral supercell , which is used to model the temperature induced disorder .",
    "the element @xmath40 is the transition probability from state @xmath41 in the left - hand lead to state @xmath42 in the right - hand lead , and @xmath43 is the number of conduction channels in lead l(r ) , which gives the sharvin conductance@xcite .",
    "the transmission matrix can be obtained by the wave function matching at the interfaces between the leads and the scattering region defined in the previous subsection . in the numerical realization , to improve the accuracy , the resistivity at a given temperature is determined by the linear regression of the resistances obtained for different lengths .",
    "the computational method described above is in the ballistic transport region , where there is no energy loss for electrons .",
    "however , the electron - phonon scattering should be an inelastic scattering processes .",
    "thus one may question whether it is valid to describe the inelastic process by the current approach .",
    "this has in fact been discussed in the previous work in detail.@xcite the authors proved that the average conductivity over time - dependent configurations will give the same results as the static electron - phonon scattering method does . in the current work , we carry out the average of the conductivities obtained for different atomic configurations determined by the gaussian distributions with different random number sequences .",
    "to test the validity of the approach in the current work , we calculate the temperature dependent resistivity of bulk copper for test purpose firstly . the debye temperature in eq .",
    "( [ amplitude1 ] ) is set to @xmath44 in the calculations@xcite .",
    "the theoretically estimated and the experimentally measured@xcite mean - square displacements of atomic vibration for different temperatures are listed in table [ tableampl ] for comparison .",
    "it is shown that the formers are at most @xmath45 less than the latters due to the anharmonicity of the lattice potentials.@xcite therefore we can use the theoretically estimated mean - square displacements in the current work .",
    ".the theoretically estimated and experimentally measured values of the mean - square atomic vibration displacements for different temperatures @xmath36 with @xmath46 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to illustrate more clearly the effect of the surface electron - phonon scattering , we list the extra resistivity @xmath47 in table [ tableamp2 ] .",
    "the extra resistivity is defined by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the resistivities of cu film for mode ( ii ) and mode ( iii ) , respectively .",
    "it is the measure of the contribution due to the surface electron - phonon scattering . in the temperature range from @xmath51 to @xmath52 ,",
    "the extra resistivity varies from @xmath53 for the cu films of different thicknesses .",
    "it is quite obvious that the surface electron - phonon scattering will become more and more important in the resistivity of cu films when the temperature increases .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental observation of plombon _",
    "et al._.@xcite their result showed that , for the copper wires with transverse dimension of 75  nm , the contribution from electron - phonon scattering increases from 16% to 63% when the temperature changes from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , we would also like to compare our result with the surface roughness contribution of the thin cu films observed by ke _ _ et al.__@xcite they showed that the surface roughness dependent resistivity are about @xmath56 , which falls in the above mentioned range of the extra resistivity .",
    "thus one may conclude that the surface electron - phonon scattering plays a role at least as important as the surface roughness in the enhanced resistivity of cu films .",
    "it can also be found in table [ tableamp2 ] that the extra resistivity @xmath47 decreases with the increase of the film thickness , which obviously shows the  size effect \" . to make it clear , plotted in fig .",
    "4 is the thickness dependence of the resistivities for different models at @xmath57 .",
    "one may find that the value of @xmath50 keeps almost unchanged for different thicknesses and even shows a slightly decrease as the thickness decreases , while @xmath58 and @xmath49 increase with the decrease of the thickness .",
    "these results reveal that the surface atomic vibration dominates the contribution to the  size effect \" of the overall resistivity .",
    "actually , the electron momentum can be decomposed into two components , i.e. the ones that are perpendicular and parallel to the surface , respectively .",
    "but only the perpendicular component affects the resistivity , which is called  specular electron scattering \" .",
    "chawla and gall@xcite have showed that it is possible to reduce the surface scattering by realizing the specular electron scattering at single - crystal cu surface . as we have presented in the previous sections , model ( iii )",
    "shows the smallest resistivity and weak size effect due to its specular surface feature . here , we may suggest that freezing the surface vibration is also necessary for practical applications to reduce the resistivity induced by the surface electron - phonon scattering .",
    "in summary , we have estimated the mean - square amplitude of atomic vibration based upon the debye model .",
    "the mean - square amplitude was used to simulate the atomic displacements during lattice vibration in the bulk and film samples of cu .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity for bulk cu was calculated and the result agrees reasonably well with the experiment one .",
    "the resistivity for three different cu film models and various thicknesses were calculated and analyzed .",
    "the result shows that the surface electron - phonon scattering plays a key role in the enhancement of the resistivity at high temperature , especially for the thinner cu films due to the quantum size effect . comparing the conductivities for three surface vibration modes",
