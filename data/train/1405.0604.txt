    "our interest in this paper is inference about this problem . for",
    "the common lognormal mean , a few authors proposed approximate methods : ahmed et al ( 2001 ) proposed an estimator and approximate confidence interval for the common lognormal mean ; baklizi and ebrahem ( 2005 ) studied several types of large samples and bootstrap intervals ; gupta and li ( 2005 ) developed procedures for estimating the common mean and investigated the performance of the resulting confidence interval for two lognormal populations .    in this paper , we first propose estimation of @xmath16 when the variances , @xmath17 are known .",
    "then two methods are given that are applicable for both hypothesis testing and interval estimation for @xmath16 , based on the concepts of generalized @xmath18-value and generalized confidence interval .",
    "these methods are based on extending the method of krishnamoorthy and lu ( 2003 ) and the method of lin and lee ( 2005 ) , which are used for the problem of common mean of several normal populations .",
