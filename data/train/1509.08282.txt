    "neurons are electrically excitable cells that  communicate through  the emission of action potentials or _ spikes _ , that are stereotyped electrical impulses .",
    "the neuronal information is transmitted through the timing of spikes and specifically through the pattern of spike fired .",
    "early electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons in specific regions of the cortex could display complex rhythmic patterns closely related to regular fluctuations of the underlying membrane potential .",
    "rhythmic firing , both intrinsic or collective , is particularly important for specific function and information coding .",
    "an essential property of cells encoding precise timings is the presence of subthreshold oscillations .",
    "these are thought to subtend precision and robustness of spike generation patterns , and are present in different cell types and brain areas including inferior olive nucleus neurons  @xcite , stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex @xcite , and dorsal root ganglia @xcite . in response to constant input , these cells display small oscillations of the voltage interspersed by one or several spikes .",
    "such trajectories alternating small voltage oscillations and spikes are referred to as mixed - mode ( bursting ) oscillations , mm(b)os .    from the biological viewpoint ,",
    "these electrical patterns rely on complex ionic and biochemical mechanisms , that are accurately described by nonlinear dynamical systems of relatively high complexity , such as the celebrated hodgkin - huxley model  @xcite and its numerous variants  @xcite .",
    "these models reproduce a broad range of excitability patterns observed in neuronal cells , including regular spiking , bursting ( periodic alternation of relatively fast spiking regimes and quiescence ) , mmos  @xcite and chaos  @xcite .",
    "a number of simplified models were proposed , but the price to pay has been the versatility . for instance , planar dynamical systems , such as the popular fitzhugh - nagumo system  @xcite , can reproduce accurately the excitable nature of nerve cells but can not generate bursts of activity , mmos or chaos .",
    "first theoretical approaches accounting for the presence of mmos in dynamical systems exhibited a possible relationship with complex structures of the dynamical invariants such as homoclinic tangencies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , an important body of theoretical works characterized mmos in dynamical systems with multiple timescales , generally associated with canard explosions  @xcite .",
    "singular perturbation theory is central in this approach and allows characterizing the presence of funnels and manifolds trapping the trajectories associated with mmos in the limit of perfect separation of timescales @xcite . in particular , a complete classification of the folded singularities and the associated mmo patterns emerging from that limit",
    "was achieved for three dimensional systems with one fast and two slow variables @xcite .",
    "these studies characterize the properties of the mmo orbits generated by such systems , and showed in particular that the sequence of numbers of small oscillations separated by large oscillations ( signature ) along a given orbit satisfied a few constraints .",
    "it was also shown that systems with more than three dimensions and/or more than two timescales may display non chaotic changes in the signature of a mmo limit cycle when varying a parameter @xcite , as well as a wider range of possible signatures .",
    "but the investigation of such mmos using multiple timescale analysis remains open since , to describe the full dynamics , one is confronted to the major difficulty of understanding the global return mechanism @xcite which depends strongly on the interactions between the different timescales . in this article",
    ", we propose a complementary approach by ( i ) considering a class of planar hybrid model that is able to generate a vast panel of mm(b)os , ( ii ) describing the underlying geometric mechanism for this generation , and ( iii ) introducing a general framework for studying the dynamical structure and the associated orbits .    contrasting with detailed biophysical models , integrate - and - fire models  @xcite are abstractions of the voltage dynamics that decouple the slow evolution of the voltage and the rapid firing of action potentials . integrate - and - fire models are hybrid dynamical systems coupling a differential equation describing the dynamics of the cell depolarization , with a discrete dynamics corresponding to the emission of action potentials and the subsequent reset .",
    "it was shown that nonlinear bidimensional integrate - and - fire neuron models  @xcite have a very rich phenomenology : they reproduce regular spiking , bursting and chaos , as well as the different types of excitability observed in nerve cells and also subthreshold oscillations under specific technical assumptions ( see  @xcite ) . to date",
    ", mmos were never reported in this class of model .",
    "mathematically , the study of the neural excitability and the presence of subthreshold periodic attractors was performed in  @xcite and only involves the continuous - time dynamical system .",
    "the study of spike patterns dynamics is more complex .",
    "it was done through the study of a specific discrete dynamics  @xcite , and was only investigated in situations in which the subthreshold dynamics has no singular points .",
    "the stability of these patterns was investigated recently through the computation of transverse lyapunov exponents  @xcite , and an explicit characterization of the orbits was obtained in the linear bidimensional mihalas and niebur integrate - and - fire model  @xcite .    here",
    ", we undertake the rigorous study of the dynamics of the system in the presence of singular points .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the subthreshold system in that situation has generically two fixed points ( except precisely at the saddle - node transition where it has one ) , one of which being a saddle and the other one being either stable or unstable .",
    "we concentrate on the unstable case . for almost any initial condition",
    "( except precisely on the stable manifold of the saddle ) , the neuron fires a spike , and therefore the adaptation map is defined everywhere except on a finite set of values . in this regime , we are led to study in depth the properties of discontinuous maps , and we will show how the orbits are precisely related to mm(b)os",
    ".    we will show that there exists a profound relationship between the type of mmo pattern and the rotation number of the adaptation map .",
    "this motivates us to characterize rotation numbers of the adaptation map . by doing so",
    ", we provide an overarching framework for the analysis of the rotation number in a class of maps with discontinuities and infinite derivative naturally appearing in the present context , by combining and extending a number of theoretical results  @xcite or applied to neuroscience  @xcite .",
    "recently developments on rotation theory and orientation - preserving circle homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms include the detailed study of interspike intervals for periodically driven one - dimensional integrate - and - fire models  @xcite .",
    "the study of the nonlinear integrate - and - fire neuron in the mm(b)o situation naturally leads to a complex problem , since the corresponding circle maps are discontinuous with unbounded derivative , which prevents us from using the classical theories of poincar and denjoy .    beyond its biological and mathematical interest for the characterization of orbits of discontinuous maps , this study has important mathematical implications with regards to mmos .",
    "it indeed provides a novel mechanism for studying rigorously and in great detail mm(b)o patterns . alternatively to classical slow - fast or homoclinic mechanisms that generally require perturbative arguments or numerical continuation , the hybrid mm(b)os exhibited here can be completely , explicitly and exactly characterized , do not require to have dynamics evolving on vastly different timescales , their existence is ensured in a relatively wide region of parameters and is not very sensitive to perturbations , since they rely on a very resilient geometric mechanism that exists even in elementary two - dimensional hybrid systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : framework ] , we introduce the equations we are interested in and review a few results on their dynamics .",
    "we also describe formally the regime in which mmos and mmbos appear , and their profound geometric origin .",
    "the type of mmo and mmbo fired is fundamentally related to the adaptation map which is discontinuous with unbounded derivative , as we show in section  [ sec : adaptationmap ] .",
    "we provide a precise description of the dynamics in the case where the adaptation map admits one discontinuity in its invariant interval ( section  [ sec : onedisc ] ) . implications and perspectives in dynamical systems and neurosciences , as well as for future analyses of cases with more",
    "discontinuities are discussed in the conclusion ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we describe and review the main properties of the class of neuron models studied in this manuscript and describe its main properties .",
    "nonlinear bidimensional integrate - and - fire neuron models are very popular models of neuronal dynamics widely used in applications .",
    "they are indeed simple yet very versatile representations of neuronal dynamics that combine excitable nature of nerve cells membranes together with the discrete nature of spike emission .",
    "when the cell is not firing an action potential , these models describe the dynamics of the membrane potential @xmath0 together with an adaptation variable @xmath1 as a nonlinear differential equation ( subthreshold dynamics ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real parameters accounting respectively for the time constant ratio between the adaptation variable and the membrane potential and for the coupling strength between these two variables .",
    "the real parameter @xmath5 represents the input current received by the neuron , and @xmath6 is a real function accounting for the leak and spike initiation currents .",
    "following @xcite , we will assume that @xmath6 is regular ( at least three times continuously differentiable ) , strictly convex , and its derivative to have a negative limit at @xmath7 and an infinite limit at @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we assume throughout the paper that the map @xmath6 is superquadratic at infinity :    [ assump : converge ] there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath6 grows faster than @xmath10 when @xmath11 ( i.e. there exists @xmath12 such that @xmath13 when @xmath14 ) .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that , under this assumption , the membrane potential blows up in finite time and , at this explosion time , say @xmath15 , the adaptation variable converges to a finite value @xmath16 .",
    "a spike is emitted at the time @xmath15 when the membrane potential blows up is not satisfied ( e.g. when @xmath6 is a quadratic polynomial  @xcite ) , an additional cutoff parameter @xmath17 is introduced , and spikes are emitted at the time @xmath15 when the membrane potential @xmath0 reaches @xmath17 .",
    "this is the case of the classical izhikevich model  @xcite .",
    "we expect most results to hold in these cases .",
    "] , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "at such an explosion time @xmath15 , it is considered that the neuron has fired an action potential whereby the voltage is instantaneously reset and the adaptation variable is updated as follows : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to the effect on the adaptation variable of the emission of a spike .",
    "note that in all models in the literature it is assumed that @xmath22 .",

    "this property requires to show that spikes do not accumulate in time , which can be done similarly as in  @xcite .",
    "the excitability properties of the system governed by the subthreshold system   were investigated exhaustively in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that all models undergo a saddle - node bifurcation and a hopf bifurcation , organized around a bogdanov - takens bifurcation , along curves that can be expressed in closed form .    .",
    "the curve given by   separating regions of unstable focus and unstable node is added in dashed blue .",

    "the different curves are depicted in the parameter space @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fps ] .",
    "they split the parameter space into a region in which the system has no singular point ( yellow region ) , a region in which the neuron has two singular points , one of which being a stable steady state ( orange and blue regions ) and a region in which the system has two unstable singular points , one of which being a saddle ( magenta and pink regions ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the stable manifold of the saddle is made in part of a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle to the repulsive point .",
    "the heteroclinic orbit can either ( i ) wind around the unstable point when it is a focus ( pink region b ) , or ( ii ) monotonically connect to the repulsive point ( magenta region a ) , depending on whether the eigenvalues of the repulsive point are real or not .",
    "the transition between these two regimes ( dashed blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : fps ] ) occurs when the linearized flow at the unstable singular point denoted @xmath33 has nonreal eigenvalues , i.e. when : @xmath34 this condition that can be made explicit in all classical cases :    * in the adaptive exponential model @xmath35 , this curve reads : @xmath36 * in the quadratic model @xmath37 we find : @xmath38 * and in the quartic model , the formula is made less transparent because of the more complex expression of the fixed points .    for producing the subsequent numerical simulations displayed in this article , we have used the quartic model @xmath39 with the following parameter values",

    "let us also briefly describe the case where the system has one stable and one saddle singular points together with an unstable periodic orbit emerging from the hopf bifurcation ( orange region ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fps ] between the hopf and saddle - homoclinic curve ) . in that case",
    ", a simple application of poincar - bendixon s theorem ensures that the stable manifold of the saddle emerges from the unstable orbit and winds around it infinitely many times .",
    "while we mostly concentrate on the case where both fixed points are unstable ( pink region b ) , the properties of the adaptation map and the ( mmbo- ) shape of the orbits in this situation generally extend readily to the case of region ( c ) .",
    "the only difference is the existence of an attraction basin of the stable fixed point : if a trajectory resets within the area delineated by the unstable periodic orbit , it converges towards the stable fixed point and stops firing .",
    "in  @xcite , the spike patterns fired were investigated theoretically in the case where the system has no singular point ( yellow region of fig .",
    "[ fig : fps ] ) . in this parameter region , the spike dynamics appear relatively simple . here , we extend this analysis to the regions in which the system features two unstable fixed points . in region b ( pink in fig .",
    "[ fig : fps ] ) , we will find mixed mode oscillations because of the geometry of the vector field . indeed , in that region of parameters , the stable manifold of the saddle is made of a heteroclinic orbit spiraling around the unstable focus , constraining trajectories reset within the spiral to proceed to a prescribed number of rotations around the unstable fixed point before firing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) .",
    "the rotations around the unstable fixed point are called _ small oscillations_.    mixed - mode oscillations ( mmos ) for the system - are spiking orbits consisting of an alternation of small oscillations and spikes . those mmos featuring also bursts of two or more consecutive spikes",
    "are referred to mixed - mode bursting oscillations ( mmbos ) .",
    "mmo patterns are characterized by the mmo _ signature _ @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the number of consecutive spikes and @xmath46 the number of subsequent small oscillations .",

    "we mean consecutive spikes not separated by small oscillations and with relatively short interspike - intervals between them .",
    "we note that the periodicity of the mmo signature does not imply the periodicity of the corresponding voltage trajectory .",
    "in particular , there can be chaotic ( nonperiodic ) trajectories displaying mmos with periodic signature .    when the reset line @xmath49 intersects the spiral , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] , the adaptation map is undefined at each intersection with the stable manifold , since the orbit of starting from such a point converges to the saddle .",
    "but for any initial condition @xmath50 between the points belonging to the stable manifold , the orbit will perform a specific number of small oscillations before firing .",
    "we emphasize that the present framework allows performing a very fine classification .",
    "first , the fact that the stable manifold is bounded in the @xmath0 variable implies that the amplitude of small oscillations , similarly to biological mmos , have a bounded amplitude considerably smaller than spikes amplitude .",
    "moreover , small oscillations can be very finely characterized with the precision of half a rotation .",

    "the solution for one given initial condition in each case is provided in the corresponding panel below .",
    "note that the time interval varies in the different plot ( indicated on the @xmath53-axis ) .",

    "]    when trajectories recur within the spiral of the stable manifold , the neuron displays an alternation of spikes and small oscillations , hence mmos or mmbos .",
    "the signature of an mmbo is directly related to the sequence of values of the adaptation variable after each reset , which can be seen as the iterations of the adaptation map that we now characterize in detail .",
    "because of its direct relationship with firing patterns and mmos , we now provide a fine characterization of the _ adaptation map _ , introduced in  @xcite .",

    "the following sections characterize the properties of the adaptation map and their relationship with spiking patterns .      by studying the orbits of the adaptation map in the case where the system has no singular point ( yellow region in fig .",
    "[ fig : fps ] ) , it was shown in  @xcite that fixed points of the adaptation map correspond to regular spiking and periodic orbits to bursting trajectories . the assumption on no singular points therein was very convenient from the technical viewpoint , since in that case the definition domain @xmath55 is the whole real line , the map @xmath62 is continuous on @xmath63 and we can characterize exactly the convexity and monotonicity properties of the map . in the present case , we will see that @xmath62 is no more continuous , it is undefined at specific points , and has unbounded derivative .",

    "first , the dilatation always overcomes the contraction , since @xmath33 is an unstable focus , i.e. the linearized flow has two complex conjugate eigenvalues with positive real part and therefore the trace of the jacobian , given by @xmath162 , is strictly positive .",

    "the rotation numbers of @xmath419 and @xmath420 differ and the rotation interval of the adaptation map evolves according to @xmath576 in the tunnel bounded by the black and red lines .",
    "nonlinear bidimensional neuron models are easily defined and show an astonishingly rich mathematical phenomenology .",
    "a number of studies had already revealed their common subthreshold dynamical properties  @xcite , investigated their spike patterns in the absence of any equilibrium state  @xcite , and all showed their versatility  @xcite and capability to reproduce neuronal dynamics  @xcite . completing this body of works by the study of spiking patterns of bidimensional spiking neuron models in the presence of multiple unstable fixed points , we have been led to investigate in depth in the present manuscript the properties of iterates of a particular class of interval maps that present both discontinuities and divergence of the derivative .",
    "interestingly , in the presence of an unstable focus of the subthreshold dynamics , we have shown that the spike patterns fired may correspond to complex oscillations that combine action potentials ( or bursts of action potentials ) and subthreshold oscillations , trajectories known as mmos or mmbos in continuous dynamical system .    contrasting with classical mechanisms for the generation of mmos",
    ", the hybrid nature of the system allows for these complex oscillations to occur in system with only two variables .",
    "moreover , the mechanism of generation of these trajectories is novel : it is a purely geometric feature of the model that depends on the topology of the invariant manifolds of the continuous - time dynamics . as such , these trajectories occur in systems that do not necessarily display separation of timescales , and more elementary dynamical systems methods allows to rigorously exhibit their existence and characterize them , for the first time , up to half - small oscillation precision , without relying on complex numerical computations of funnels and manifolds in high - dimensional systems .",
    "one may however wonder whether if there exists a relationship between the two systems , and particularly it is tempting to interpret the hybrid system as the reduction of a differentiable multiple timescale system in a certain singular limit . yet , the wide panel of mmos associated with the versatile geometric structure presented in this article indicates that such system is at least four - dimensional and involves more than three timescales . the construction of a suitable return mechanism for such system remains a challenging problem from the dynamical viewpoint .",
    "this study thus constitutes a showcase for mmbos that is both rigorous and relatively straightforward .",
    "additionally , it can be directly used for the analyses of the reduced systems emerging from highly complex dynamics involving multiple timescales that may be encountered in future developments of canard - induced mmo analysis .    beyond the mathematical interest of this new mechanism for the generation of mm(b)os",
    ", this study came back to the biophysical origin of the model . by doing so",
    ", we have found important to take into account the consequence of the duration of a spike fired in the reset mechanism , which has resulted in introducing a slightly modified reset mechanism ( featuring an additional parameter , @xmath43 , accounting for an attenuation of the adaptation variable ) and showed that the introduction of this new parameter allows the quartic model ( or , presumably , all other models of the class , including the izhikevich model  @xcite or the adaptive exponential  @xcite ) to be in any of the cases identified .",
    "this property completes nicely the repertoire of possible behaviors of this class of models : these simple dynamical systems have the mathematical advantage to present a very rich phenomenology , and the computational advantage to reproduce all trajectories displayed by real neurons .",
    "it is important to note that the partition of the parameter space in fig .",
    "[ partition_d_gamma ] is obtained from explicit conditions involving the dynamical invariants of the continuous dynamics .",
    "therefore , it gives a useful tool for solving the problem of parameter estimation for the model in order to reproduce model outputs fulfilling a list of qualitative and quantitative specifications .",
    "in particular , the ability to reproduce fine trajectories of mmbos is very useful in situations in which synchronization is essential : in the presence of noise , the presence of small subthreshold oscillations supports the generation of precise and robust rhythmic spike generation patterns , as recorded in specific rhythmic pattern generators as the inferior olive nucleus @xcite , in the stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex @xcite , and in the dorsal root ganglia @xcite .    from the computational neuroscience viewpoint , it is important to understand the role of the different biophysical parameters on the qualitative responses of neurons",
    ". this raises at least two perspective works .",
    "first , in the flavor of  @xcite , we could go deeper into the analysis of the shape of the adaptation map in the particular case of the adaptive exponential integrate - and - fire system , and thus relate the presence and possible signature of mmbos to variations in biophysical parameters .",
    "second , understanding the structural stability of trajectories and their possible bifurcations , as a function of the parameters , in hybrid systems is still a complex issue that would be very informative from the application viewpoint .",
    "first works in that direction have been developed in  @xcite : taking into account the infinite contraction of the trajectories in the voltage variable associated with the reset , the authors proposed to compute expansion or contraction exponents along transverse directions , providing a notion of stability of hybrid orbits which is more explicit than criteria on the shape of the adaptation map .",
    "it would be interesting to develop these methods in the cases of non - monotonic spiraling trajectories associated with the presence of mmbos .",
    "alternatively , using models with simpler subthreshold dynamics , for instance linear or piecewise linear  @xcite , may allow for a derivation of an explicit expression of the reset maps , thus for fine characterization of the stability of the orbits .    in these studies",
    ", we have made a crucial use of the planar nature of the system .",
    "mmbos will of course exist in higher dimensional hybrid dynamical systems , and will require fine characterization of the invariant manifolds .",
    "the extension of the theory to higher dimensional systems would be particularly interesting from the computational neuroscience viewpoint for understanding the behavior of neuron networks in which several neurons driven by this dynamics are coupled and communicate at the times of the spikes .",
    "one difficulty of the study is related to the fact that the map under scrutiny , the adaptation map , is not known analytically .",
    "our mathematical analysis have covered in detail the cases of overlapping and non - overlapping maps with one discontinuity .",
    "these situations do not cover all possible shapes of adaptation maps which can induce lifts with more discontinuity points , thus presumably with positive and negative jumps , or lifts with only positive jumps but non - monotonous .",
    "a direct mathematical perspective of this work is thus to develop rotation theory for this kind discontinuous degree - one circle maps .",
    "while in these cases it is still possible to obtain an upper and lower over - bounds for the rotation set by computing the rotation numbers of the non - decreasing maps @xmath419 and @xmath420 , defined in the same way as in the overlapping case , it remains an open question to whether if any value within this interval corresponds to the rotation number of a given orbit , and it is not hard to find elementary examples in which this is false .",
    "thus the general , complete and precise characterization of the dynamics of the system is a complex and rich mathematical problem that raises several deep questions of iterates of interval maps with discontinuities .",
    "the other question , still open even in the more classical overlapping case , is to characterize the stability of the orbits in the case where the system has multiple possible rotation numbers of points .",
    "a possible approach would be to use and develop symbolic dynamics and kneading theory for such discontinuous interval maps .",
    "however , we emphasize that in our purpose to characterize the orbits and the pattern of complex oscillation fired , the rotation theory is the most efficient since we have a univocal bidirectional link between the rotation number and the signature of the mmbo ( theorem [ dynamics2 ] ) , which allowed us to characterize situations in which the neuron shows regular spiking , mmo , bursting , mmbo or chaotic behavior .",
    "the aim of this work was first of all to demonstrate the new geometric and intuitive mechanism for generating mm(b)os in one of the most popular hybrid neurone models . however , all the above deep mathematical questions open exciting perspectives for future work .",

    "this theory is valid under non - degeneracy conditions on the dependence of the maps on the parameters . in particular ,",
    "a general result on the monotone family of increasing lifts @xmath584 , @xmath585 $ ] , can be shown under the assumption that the map @xmath586 is increasing and continuous with respect to the hausdorff topology of h - convergence , which is equivalent to the uniform convergence at the continuity points ( see  @xcite ) , i.e. under the condition @xmath587 where @xmath588 , @xmath282 , denotes the discontinuity point of the lift @xmath589 .",
    "as the reset parameter @xmath42 is increased , the map @xmath62 is rigidly increased by the same amount .",
    "this particularly simple dependence of the map on @xmath42 allows to control precisely how the dynamical features of the map vary with @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , we note that the boundaries of the invariant interval @xmath590 and @xmath591 are also simply translated as @xmath42 varies , and in particular the amplitude @xmath592 of the invariant interval is constant .",
    "moreover , we also observe that for any @xmath391 $ ] , the maps @xmath392 have the same discontinuity point @xmath593 , the lifts @xmath594 are continuous at points @xmath595 , have positive jumps at @xmath596 and satisfy @xmath597 .",
    "so in fact all these lifts @xmath594 can be seen as lifts of non - continuous invertible circle maps under the same projection @xmath598    however , even if the map @xmath392 is increasing with @xmath42 , this is not necessarily the case of @xmath594 , because of the simultaneous fluctuation of the invariant interval . indeed , when each lift @xmath594 is obtained from @xmath599 the relation @xmath600 for @xmath601 might be violated in the intervals @xmath602 , when we glue the right part of the graph of @xmath603 to its left part ( in @xmath604 ) . but noticing that under the additional condition @xmath393 for any @xmath605 $ ] , the interval @xmath606 $ ] constitutes a particular invariant interval in which the adaptation map @xmath392 is piecewise increasing and non - overlapping , we can build well - behaved lifts @xmath607 based on the shape of the map @xmath392 on this bigger invariant interval @xmath606 $ ] . to the difference of @xmath594 , these new lifts are discontinuous at the points @xmath608 ( where they have positive jumps of amplitude @xmath609 ) , in addition to their discontinuity at @xmath610 , @xmath611 .",
    "the latter jump remains also positive under our assumption that @xmath612 is strictly greater than @xmath613 .",
    "while this construction did not substantially modified the dynamics , it has the advantage of ensuring that the mapping @xmath614 is increasing in both variables .",
    "moreover , we note that enlarging the invariant interval has no effect on the orbits , since any orbit of @xmath392 with an initial condition in @xmath606 $ ] enters after a few iterations in the interval @xmath615 $ ] . since the orbits @xmath616 project @xmath617 to the orbits @xmath618 , we therefore have @xmath619 .    concluding the proof therefore only amounts to showing that the map @xmath620 is continuous in the hausdorff topology ,",
    "which is very simple once noted , as mentioned above , that this property is equivalent to the uniform convergence at all points in the interior of @xmath606\\setminus \\{w_1\\}$ ] and that @xmath621 on this interval .",
    "thus the mapping @xmath622 has the properties listed in the theorem and consequently , the same holds for @xmath623 .",
    "we have noticed that while continuity of the lifts under the hausdorff topology was always satisfied in our case , an additional assumption is necessary to ensure that the mapping @xmath624 ( where @xmath625 denotes a parameter , here @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) is increasing in both variables , which otherwise is not always true .",
    "we emphasize that even in situations in which this mapping is not increasing in both variables , the rotation number remains continuous under the @xmath626-convergence provided that the limit function @xmath589 is strictly increasing , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.7).@xmath627    _ proof of theorem [ prop : overlap_devil ] _ the first part of the proof amounts to showing that the induced maps @xmath628 and @xmath629 are continuous ( as mappings from the subset @xmath630 of @xmath631 into the functional space @xmath632 ) .",
    "this regularity readily stems from the fact that @xmath441 and @xmath633 are simply shifted by the amount @xmath634 .",
    "but as in the proof of theorem  [ new_devil ] , one needs to be careful to the variation of the invariant intervals at points @xmath591 and @xmath590 .",
    "these also have an additive relationship in @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath635 and similarly for @xmath590 ) .",
    "thus close from the discontinuity , we do not have an additive relationship in @xmath461 in general , but for the maps @xmath636 and @xmath637 , we can prove even the uniform continuity in @xmath638 :      we now fix @xmath640 and @xmath641 ^ 2 $ ] with @xmath642 , and analyse the maps @xmath643 and @xmath644 in the interval @xmath645 without loss of generality , since it suffices to consider the maps on an arbitrary interval of length @xmath592 .    for @xmath646 , basing on the shape of @xmath441 , we immediately obtain @xmath647 for @xmath648 , we find @xmath649 we now distinguish between two cases depending on whether @xmath650 or not .",
