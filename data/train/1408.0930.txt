    "it has been shown recently that the fine structure splitting of the spin of a mn can be modified optically @xcite or decreased significantly in strain - free qds @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that a mn atom could develop a large anisotropy energy in the @xmath4 range when it is exchange - coupled with a single confined heavy - hole spin @xcite .",
    "the two low energy hole - mn states , with total spin @xmath5 , should behave like an ising spin system forming an atomic ferromagnet similar to what was observed for instance for single co atoms deposited on a cu surface @xcite .",

    "the transverse magnetic field dependence of the optical pumping signal reveals a magnetic anisotropy of the positively charged exciton - mn complex .",
    "we show that this anisotropy is controlled by the strain induced fine structure of the mn atom and a residual exchange coupling of the two holes with the mn spin .    using this optical pumping technique , we measure , at zero magnetic field and at t=7k , a spin relaxation time of the hole - mn complex of about 1 @xmath1 .",

    ", the hole - mn spin relaxation rate seems to be overestimated .",
    "however , a quantitative description is difficult with this model because of the simplified description of the coherent dynamics of the hole - mn system and the uncertainty in the parameter @xmath123 .",
    "in addition , we have to notice that even if we choose a gate voltage and excitation conditions for which we only observe the positively charged exciton in the pl spectra , we can not exclude to have fluctuation of the hole in the dark .",
    "an empty dot during a fraction of the dark time would artificially increase the observed relaxation time .",

    "the spin of the hole - mn system can be efficiently initialized by optical pumping under quasi - resonant excitation with circularly polarized light .",
    "we demonstrated that the optical pumping of the hole - mn system and its transverse magnetic field dependence are controlled by the electron - mn exchange coupling within the positively charged exciton - mn complex . despite the magnetic anisotropy of the hole - mn system ,",

    "this fast spin relaxation is a consequence of the valence band mixing always present in ii - vi self - assembled qds . in different qd systems with a larger hole confinement and weaker valence band mixing one",
    "could expect a spin memory controlled by the electrically tunable magnetic anisotropy of the hole - mn complex . nevertheless , a relaxation time in the micro - second range is sufficient to exploit these positively charged mn - doped qds for an optical ultrafast coherent control of the mn spin @xcite .",
