    "searching for @xmath8-ray  lines from supernovae ( sne ) remains one of the primary goals of @xmath8-ray  astrophysics , and also _ integral _",
    "@xcite , as @xmath8-ray line studies can probe the nucleosynthesis and explosion kinematics of these events .",
    "many of the nuclear decay chains ( @xmath0co , @xmath9ti ) that produce @xmath8-ray  lines in young sne also produce positrons , making them a prime candidate for the source of positrons for the diffuse galactic annihilation emission .",
    "however , there has not been a detection of positron annihilation  radiation from an individual sn or a sn remnant ( snr ) .",
    "the main uncertainties on the expected annihilation  fluxes from young sne are the mean lifetime and escape fraction of positrons . for sne type ia , the lifetime of a positron will be small in the initial sn , but may become as high as @xmath10 years as the sn expands .",
    "the mean positron lifetime will be even longer , @xmath11 years , in cases where the thermalization takes place in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , rather than in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "if the ejecta s magnetic field is weak , and/or radially combed , then 95% of the @xmath0co decay positrons annihilate promptly , and 5% escape to annihilate on a longer time - scale @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a tangled and strong magnetic field would confine @xmath6100% of the @xmath0co positrons resulting prompt annihilation , leaving a much smaller annihilation  radiation flux from the delayed @xmath9ti decays ( @xmath12 @xmath685 years ) .",
    "simulations of late optical b & v light curves of type ia sne indicate that the 5% escape of the @xmath0co positrons is the more probable scenario , assuming the optical light curves trace the bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "a later study also showed that 16 of 22 sne ia observed at late epochs exhibit the same shape bvri light curves as the initial sampling of 10 sne ia , strengthening the conclusion of 5% escape fraction @xcite .",
    "however , excess nir emission at late epochs was reported recently from sn  1998bu and sn 2000cx @xcite",
    ". this excess may be due to emission shifting into the nir wavelength range from the optical range .",
    "the optical - nir bolometric light curves for those sne favor full positron trapping . observations of positron annihilation radiation from individual snrs can improve our understanding of magnetic field configurations in these objects , as well as determine their role in producing the diffuse galactic annihilation  emission .",
    "the positrons are initially hot , and slow down by coulomb losses , ionization , and excitation .",
    "once they are cool enough ( less than a few hundred ev ) , the positrons can have charge exchange with neutrals , recombine radiatively with free electrons , and/or annihilate directly with free or bound electrons , producing a line at 511 kev , and a positronium continuum @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the photons that are emitted in the line and the continuum depends on the properties of the annihilating medium .",
    "the recent analysis of the spi data yields positronium fractions close to 0.95 for the diffuse galactic annihilationradiation @xcite . for the width of the line",
    ", spi finds 2.4@xmath130.3 fwhm , if the line is approximated as a simple gaussian @xcite .",
    "1.3 kev ) and broad ( fwhm @xmath6 5.1 kev ) component @xcite . ] note that the positronium fraction and the fwhm values for the galaxy are not necessarily appropriate for individual sne annihilations .",
    "the positronium fraction depends on the temperature and the ionization state of the medium @xcite , and the fwhm can be broadened by doppler effects if the annihilation takes place in the ejecta .    for weak and/or radially combed magnetic fields that permit 5% escape",
    ", positron transport simulations estimate that roughly 8 @xmath2 10@xmath14 positrons escape from a given sn ia @xcite .",
    "when combined with the rate of 0.5 type ia sne per century , a steady state flux of 9 @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5  would be expected if the positrons are assumed to be annihilated at a distance of 8 kpc ( distance to the galactic center ) .",
    "the latest measurements of spi yields a total galactic 511 kev flux of 1.52.9 @xmath2 10@xmath15 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5  depending on the galactic distribution model @xcite",
    ". the higher end of that flux range is in agreement with osse on _ cgro _ , _ smm _ , and _ tgrs _ observations of 511 kev line emission @xcite .",
    "the expected flux from the 5% escape case is therefore 30%  60% of the total flux , with the higher fluxes producing the lower sn fractions .",
    "therefore , if positrons escape the ejecta , but are confined to local regions of the sne , the maps of 511 should trace the recent sn ia history .",
    "the bulge - to - disk flux ratio is confined to be within the range of 13 ( and luminosity ratio of 39 ) .",
    "this ratio is consistent with no galactic scale diffusion , and makes type ia sne prime candidates for the source of galactic bulge positrons , along with low mass x - ray binaries ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion of potential candidates for diffuse annihilationradiation ) .",
    "the most promising individual source candidate to search for a positron annihilation  line is sn 1006 , a recent sn thought to be of type ia .",
    "our group observed sn 1006  with _ integral _  for @xmath61000 ks , with the main goals of characterizing the hard x - ray emission using isgri and jem - x instruments @xcite , and searching for 511 kev emission line with spi . in this letter",
    "we discuss the results of the analysis of the spi data , and place limits on the 511 kev line and positronium continuum emission from sn 1006 .",
    "spi is a coded - aperture telescope using an array of 19 cooled germanium detectors for high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "it works in 20 kev  8 mev band , and has an energy resolution of @xmath62 kev at 511 kev .",
    "the fully coded field of view is 16@xmath16 , and the angular resolution is 3@xmath16 .",
    "the _ integral _  observations of sn 1006  took place in two sets .",
    "the first 250 ks set was conducted early in the mission , between mjd  52650 and mjd  52659 corresponding to _ integral _",
    "revolutions 30 and 32 .",
    "these observations will be denoted as `` set i '' .",
    "the second 750 ks set was conducted between mjd  53024 and mjd  53034 during revolutions 155 - 158 , which will be denoted as `` set ii '' . for spi ,",
    "set i has all 19 detectors working , whereas for set ii , the active detectors were reduced to 18 after the loss of detector 2 .    before any analysis , we filtered out the pointings with high anti - coincidence shield rates , mostly occurring during the entry and exit of the radiation belts .",
    "we used osa 4.2 , spiros 6.1 , and single - detector events for the analysis .",
    "several background models were tried with `` gedsat '' as the main model , which assumes that the background level is proportional to the product of saturated detector trigger rate and live - time .",
    "we used the continuum energy band of 523 - 545 kev for normalization .",
    "we tried normalization with an off observation ( empty field observation in revolution 130 ) , and also using a template file ( provided by j. kndlseder ) .",
    "the details of the background methods and information about the template file can be found in @xcite . finally , we tried the mean count modulation method in spiros which does not require a prior background determination",
    ". maximum likelihood method in spiros was used for imaging .",
    "note that sn 1006  is @xmath630@xmath17 in diameter , and is effectively a point source for spi . set i and set ii were analyzed separately .",
    "we used 5 , 7 , and 10 kev energy intervals encompassing 511 kev to factor in possibilities for both narrow and broad emission .",
    "we also searched for the positronium continuum in 200500 kev band with spi .",
    "[ fig : spifig ] shows the spiros sigma image in the energy band of 508.5513.5 kev , using the mean count modulation method .",
    "we obtained similar images in larger energy bands , and different background methods .",
    "we have not detected significant 511 kev line emission in any of the energy band intervals around 511 kev .",
    "the positronium component was not detected either .",
    "table  [ table : res ] shows the details of the search and 3@xmath1 sensitivity limits of spi for the given energy band and observing time .",
    "the combined upper limit is for 18 detectors in set i and set ii .",
    ".[table : res ] spi upper limits [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "sn 1006  is an ideal candidate to search for 511 kev positron annihilation  line emission , as it is a well studied , historical type ia sn with relatively well determined characteristics .",
    "the distance is @xmath62.2 kpc , the age is 999 years , the angular size is @xmath630@xmath17 , and the ejecta s current electron density is 0.7 cm@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "predictions of the current 511 kev line and positronium continuum fluxes from sn 1006  depend upon understanding the complicated interaction of the sn shock with the ism , and the resulting degree of magnetic confinement of positrons @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that positrons that escape from the sn ejecta typically have @xmath6 500 kev of energy upon their escape @xcite .",
    "the range of 500 kev positrons in the ism is such that few positrons would be expected to thermalize within 1000 years @xcite .",
    "this situation is even worse at the location of sn 1006 , where the ism density appears even lower than four media treated by @xcite .",
    "thus , if the shock fails to confine escaping positrons , perhaps even accelerating the positrons , then sn 1006  would be only a faint source of annihilation radiation , even if positrons escaped the ejecta .",
    "the primary argument against positrons crossing the shock in this fashion are circumstantial , as the distribution of annihilation radiation from sne would then trace the distribution of matter in the galaxy .",
    "it has been shown that the diffuse 511 kev emission mapping results from osse and spi @xcite indicate a strong bulge component , with a bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio of 39 . by contrast , the matter content of the galaxy is concentrated in the disk ( bulge - to - disk mass ratio is only 0.31.0 , * ? ? ? * ) , which appears to eliminate large - scale positron transport from source to annihilation site ( not just from sne , but in general ) .",
    "if the magnetic field in the shock successfully confines the positrons , they will repeatedly traverse the inside of the bubble , being reflected numerous times .",
    "preliminary simulations of this scenario suggest that the positrons will encounter a sufficient amount of matter to be thermalized and annihilate on a 1000 year timescale .",
    "however , these simulations are too crude for us to confidently predict an annihilation rate at 1000 years after the sn event .",
    "the more detailed simulation will be conducted for the analysis of the entire dataset including this and the near - future observations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spipred ] , we show the predicted 511 kev fluxes from sn 1006  as a function of mean positron lifetime for the 5% escape fraction .",
    "the figure also shows the current 3@xmath1 spi upper limit , and the 3@xmath1 sensitivity level that will be achieved after the approved future observations ( 2.5 msec ) .",
    "if 5% of the positrons indeed escape the ejecta and are locally confined with a lifetime less than @xmath19 years , then spi is expected to detect 511 kev annihilation emission from sn 1006 once the additional observations are performed .",
    "[ fig : spipred ] also shows the predicted fluxes for sn 1006  if the positron yield is increased by a factor of 2.5 , so that sne ia could account for * all * galactic positrons .",
    "the spi non - detection suggests against this possibility if the mean positron lifetime is less than 10@xmath7 years .",
    "note that , in case of no escape from the remnant , the expected 511 kev flux from only @xmath9ti decays is no larger than 4 @xmath2 10@xmath20 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5  from sn 1006 , which is far too low to be detectable by spi .",
    "we stress that the conclusions above depend strongly on the assumption of no escape to the ism , and thermalization in the ejecta .",
    "the future observations of sn 1006 , and other sn ia remnants of different ages ( both younger and older ) , will provide essential information for understanding positron transport in snrs .",
    "a non - detection would still leave an ambiguity ; the reason can either be @xmath60% escape fraction from the ejecta , or very long thermalization timescale of positrons in the ism .",
    "on the other hand , detection of annihilation  radiation would be a strong indicator of thermalization in the ejecta , and confirm whether sne ia are important contributors of galactic positrons .",
