    "temperature is one of the fundamental and arguably one of the most frequently measured physical quantities .",
    "apart from the central role played by the concept of temperature in the fields of thermodynamics and statistical physics , precise temperature measurements are important for all branches of modern science and technology . indeed ,",
    "precise knowledge of the temperature of a sample proved indispensable for many advancements in physics , biology , chemistry , and atmospheric sciences , as well as in material science and the microelectronic industry . in this paper , we study the classical and quantum limitations that constrain the precision with which we can measure temperature .",
    "these limitations are imposed by the combination of the laws of statistics , statistical physics , and quantum mechanics .",
    "the theoretical limit on the precision of classical thermometers is known as the standard quantum limit or the shot - noise limit , @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is a constant depending on the properties of a classical thermometer and the sample , and @xmath2 is the number of resources , which for classical thermometers typically reduces to the ( mean ) number of _ uncorrelated _ particles that makes up the thermometer or the time it takes to make a measurement @xcite .",
    "the standard quantum limit predicts that in order to measure the temperature of a sample with high precision we need @xmath2 to be large , which translates to enlarging our classical thermometer .",
    "a typical measurement consists of bringing the thermometer into physical contact with the sample and then letting the two systems thermalize .",
    "however , if we wish to use a large and thus a highly precise thermometer , then this approach is not optimal , as it will , in most cases , significantly disturb the temperature of the sample we are probing . fortunately , there is a way to avoid this problem .",
    "namely , we could measure the temperature without putting our thermometer and the sample in direct physical contact and thus minimize the sample s temperature disturbance that can arise from the heat exchange .",
    "in such a case , the sample of interest is observed remotely .",
    "there are many different techniques of the so - called noninvasive or noncontact thermometry that are used across many branches of science and industry .",
    "most noninvasive techniques infer temperature from the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "one of the most common optical techniques that is used for temperature measurements is the measurement of the thermal infrared radiation naturally emitted by all heated samples @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the principle used in the commercially available pyrometers .    on the other hand , recent years",
    "have witnessed a growing interest in applying various ideas that take advantage of quantum mechanical features of nature to the problem of temperature measurements @xcite .",
    "specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that it is possible to map the problem of measuring the temperature onto the problem of estimating an unknown phase .",
    "moreover , it was further shown that by using the techniques of phase estimation theory , the classical standard - quantum - limited precision in temperature estimation may be improved to the so - called heisenberg limit , @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is a constant depending on the properties of a quantum thermometer and the sample , and @xmath2 is the number of resources , which for quantum thermometers usually denotes the ( mean ) number of _ correlated _ particles that makes up the thermometer @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this improvement occurs only for measurements in the absence of decoherence ; typically , the presence of noise reduces the heisenberg - limited precision back to the classical shot - noise - limited scaling , @xmath5 , with a possible advantage constrained to the scaling constant @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the prospect of using interferometric tools of quantum - enhanced phase estimation for temperature measurements is rather intriguing and , we believe , has not been fully explored .",
    "the main advantages of interferometric thermometry are a very fast response time of interferometric devices , which means that rapid variations in temperature can be measured , the ability to measure a wide range of temperatures , and the high spatial resolution allowing for temperature measurements of micrometer- and even nanometer - size spots @xcite .",
    "when combined in a single measurement setup , these advantages open up a possibility of preparing temperature maps with very high spatial and temporal resolutions that could find a wide range of important applications in the microelectronic industry , and in the material and life sciences .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of those most immediate benefits , interferometric thermometry met with limited attention in the past .",
    "interferometric thermometry was used mostly in the microelectronic industry for temperature measurements of the semiconductor electronic devices ; in industry , this approach to thermometry is used not only for local temperature measurements but also as a kind of scanning device for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient @xcite . in academia , apart from the theoretical proposal discussed above , the idea of interferometric thermometry realized with atomic quantum dots was most recently employed to study temperature measurements of the bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work that rigorously studies the interferometric approach to thermometry .",
    "we determine the fundamental precision of optical interferometric thermometers . to this end",
    ", we use the single - mode gaussian states of light to probe the temperature variations in a general medium modeled as a dissipative thermal reservoir .",
    "we then compare our precision limits against the theoretical limit on the precision offered by commonly used classical noninvasive temperature sensors , the so - called pyrometers .",
    "this comparison is provided for one of the most important classes of materials used in many quantum technologies , namely , the nonlinear crystals .",
    "a precise sensing of tiny temperature variations followed by an active temperature stabilization is required in many experimental setups based on the nonlinear crystals such as the ppktp crystal .",
    "the nonlinear crystals are used as a source of indistinguishable photons generated via the spontaneous parametric down - conversion process and the quality of those photons depends strongly on the temperature of the crystal @xcite . hence , new practical methods for ultraprecise temperature sensing and stabilization , which could be easily incorporated into the existing experimental setups , are of paramount importance for the development of various optical quantum technologies that rely heavily on the bright sources of truly indistinguishable photons . the interferometric approach to thermometry that we study appears ideal for such applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimation ] , we introduce the basic concepts of the classical and quantum estimation theory . in sec .  [",
    "sec : pyrometer ] , we derive the fundamental precision limits for the idealized classical noninvasive pyrometers that we use as a benchmark to judge the usefulness of the interferometric thermometry . section [ sec : interthermo ] introduces in detail the idea of interferometric thermometry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] , we find the precision of temperature estimation obtained via the interferometric phase measurement in the presence of a dissipative thermal reservoir focusing on temperature measurements in nonlinear crystals . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude with final remarks .",
    "the task of temperature measurement can be translated applying the language of estimation theory to the problem of parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "the generic scheme for such a problem is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] . in order to estimate the value of parameter @xmath8",
    ", we send a probe system prepared in an initial quantum state @xmath9 through a sample , which depends on @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction between our probe system and the sample can then be modeled as an evolution under a quantum channel @xmath10 .",
    "hence , following the interaction , the probe system is left in the output quantum state @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "next , we subject the probe system to a general quantum measurement , described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath12 , which produces the measurement results @xmath13 .",

    "following the evolution stage , the probe system is subjected to a general quantum measurement described by a povm @xmath16 , which produces the measurement results @xmath13 .",
    "these measurement results are then used to make an estimate of the parameter @xmath8 via the estimator function @xmath14.,width=294 ]    the procedure described above naturally never returns the true value of @xmath8 .",
    "we quantify the discrepancy between the estimated value and the true value of @xmath8 with the root - mean - square error @xmath17^{1/2}$ ] , where the average is taken with respect to the probability distribution @xmath18 of the measurement outcomes @xmath13 . in the most common case when we have a specific povm measurement @xmath12 , corresponding to an observable @xmath19 , and",
    "we wish to estimate the value of @xmath8 from the mean value of @xmath19 , the precision is given by the standard error propagation formula @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard deviation of the observable @xmath19 calculated for the output state @xmath15 .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath19 may as well be a classical observable .",
    "the above equation is valid for any observable , but it explicitly assumes an estimation from the mean value of @xmath19",
    ". it may happen that this is not the optimal approach and we could improve the precision by choosing another estimator .",
    "moreover , it may also happen that the measurement we choose is not optimal either . in order to avoid such problems ,",
    "we need to optimize eq .",
    "( [ eq : propagation ] ) over all possible measurements and estimators , which is not an easy task .",
    "fortunately , the solution to this optimization problem is provided by the classical and quantum cramr - rao inequalities @xcite , which state that for any _ unbiased _ estimator , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of independent experimental repetitions and @xmath24 is the classical fisher information defined as @xmath25 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the classical fisher information gives a lower bound on the precision optimized over all unbiased estimators for a specific povm measurement @xmath12 .",

    "in a situation where the parameter is encoded by a unitary transformation , i.e. , @xmath31=u_\\theta\\lambda[\\rho_0]u_\\theta^\\dagger$ ] , where @xmath32 is unitary and @xmath33 is a @xmath8-independent quantum channel describing possible decoherence processes , then @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the sld for the state @xmath36 $ ] . in such a case ,",
    "the qfi does not depend on @xmath8 , that is , @xmath37 .",
    "the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb ) and its classical counterpart are known to be saturable in the limit of a large number of repetitions , @xmath38 .",
    "the optimal measurement consists of a set of projectors on the eigenbasis of the sld and outputs the measurement results , which are then processed with the maximum - likelihood estimator @xcite .",
    "such projective measurements are typically very hard to implement reliably in the laboratory ; however , very often it is possible to saturate the quantum cramr - rao bound with a more natural set of measurements , for example , with the optical homodyne or the parity detection @xcite .",
    "since the qcrb is already optimized over all possible povms and unbiased estimators , we are usually only left with the optimization over all possible input quantum states @xmath39 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , one of the most widely used optical noninvasive temperature sensors relies on a measurement of thermal infrared radiation naturally emitted by all heated samples @xcite .",
    "this measurement principle is used in the commercially available pyrometers . before we explain the operation of these devices in detail ,",
    "let us explain what we understand by the term noninvasive .",
    "pyrometers measure the temperature of a sample by probing the thermal radiation that the sample emits , but not the sample itself .",
    "this thermal radiation and the sample are in thermal contact , resulting in a thermal equilibrium state . in the following , we assume that the presence of the pyrometer ( and a short probing time ) has a negligible influence on this equilibrium state , and hence ,",
    "in this sense , we can consider pyrometers as noninvasive .",
    "what is the fundamental precision of this type of temperature sensors ?",
    "pyrometers estimate temperature by measuring the flux of thermal radiation emitted by a sample modeled as a blackbody in thermal equilibrium , and using the well - known stefan - boltzmann law , infer the temperature @xcite .",
    "typically , those devices take into account the nonunit emissivity @xmath40 of most physical samples ; however , for the purpose of this derivation , we assume that we are dealing with a perfect blackbody . the flux of thermal radiation @xmath41 , that is , the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody across all wavelengths per unit time , is quantified by the stefan - boltzmann formula , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath44 is the temperature of the sample . in order to calculate the precision of temperature estimation based on the stefan - boltzmann law",
    ", we use the error propagation formula given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : propagation ] ) with @xmath45 . using the definition of the variance in the thermal photon number @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the mean number of thermal photons distributed according to the bose - einstein statistics @xcite , @xmath48^{-1},\\ ] ] and assuming for simplicity that pyrometers are sensitive to all frequencies of electromagnetic radiationm , because these devices are not sensitive enough beyond this band .",
    "however , for most common applications , this range is perfectly sufficient as most of the thermal radiation is emitted in the range of 0.1100 @xmath49 m @xcite . ] and excluding all sources of loss in the detection process , we can calculate @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the density of modes per unit interval in @xmath52 in a unit area .",
    "this allows us to find the fundamental precision in temperature estimation for the idealized pyrometer .",
    "however , the error that we obtain from the error propagation formula represents the square root of the inverse of the information collected per unit surface area , per unit measurement time . in order to include the total information collected by the pyrometer",
    ", we need to divide this error by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the surface area of the sample we are probing , which we assume is optimized to be equal to the size of the detector area used in our pyrometer , and @xmath55 is the response time of the device , that is , the time it takes to make a measurement .",
    "this leads to the following theoretical limit on the precision in temperature estimation for the idealized pyrometer : @xmath56 this result has a standard - quantum - limited scaling with respect to the response time @xmath55 , which here corresponds to the amount of resources @xmath2 we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ; originates from the stefan - boltzmann law , which represents one of the very first results of quantum theory .",
    "] therefore , the longer we probe the sample , the more photons the detector registers .",
    "modern pyrometers operate in the ms regime ; hence , we assume @xmath57 ms . now further assuming that we measure the temperature of a surface with @xmath58 @xmath59 , we find that the local precision of such a measurement near @xmath44 = 298 k is @xmath60 nk . therefore , at the fundamental level ,",
    "pyrometers are highly precise devices .",
    "naturally , a real commercially available pyrometer estimates temperature with a much lower precision ; a typical precision at the room - temperature range is , at best , 0.1 k.    is the measurement of the total thermal radiation the most optimal measurement we can perform ? surely , this is not the only way we could use thermal light to infer the temperature of a sample .",
    "we could , for example , imagine a more sophisticated device that estimates temperature based on the detailed knowledge of the spectral photon - number distribution of thermal radiation .",
    "such a device would measure the photon - number probability distribution for each frequency . this kind of measurement would provide more information about the character of the thermal light and , therefore , should allow for improved temperature estimation . in order to calculate this enhanced precision , we need to find the classical fisher information for a photon - number - resolving measurement .",
    "this is a measurement that allows us to estimate the photon - number probability distribution @xmath61 , which enters into the definition of the thermal state , @xmath62 where @xmath47 is the mean number of photons present in the thermal state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanthermalnumber ] ) .",
    "the classical fisher information for @xmath61 for a single frequency @xmath52 is @xmath63 surprisingly , when we calculate the total fisher information per unit area for all frequencies , @xmath64 where @xmath51 is the density of modes per unit interval in @xmath52 in a unit area , we obtain via the classical cramr - rao inequality the very same expression as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pyrometer ] ) , that is , @xmath65 this result means that inferring temperature from the total flux of thermal radiation is already optimal .",
    "any additional knowledge of the photon - number distribution does not contribute to the information about temperature .",
    "furthermore , as can be easily checked , the calculation of the qfi for @xmath66 returns the same result because the thermal state is diagonal in the fock basis and so is the corresponding sld @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is always optimal to measure the mean number of photons at the output for each frequency , as we have effectively done in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pyrometerfcl ] ) , or simply to measure the total flux of thermal radiation .",
    "having explained how the noninvasive classical thermometers work , we now describe in detail the operation of quantum interferometric thermometers .",
    "it may be somewhat confusing to consider the interferometric thermometry as noninvasive or noncontacting since , as will be apparent soon , the photons in the probe beam are clearly interacting with the sample and , therefore , the thermometer is in direct physical contact with the sample , implying an exchange of energy .",
    "however , as long as this interaction and the ensuing exchange of energy do not cause a significant change in the sample s temperature , we can consider this method as truly noninvasive @xcite .",
    "the scope of this work is to investigate a possible advantage offered by such interferometric devices that typically rely on the use of nonclassical states of light .",

    "the bright yellow beam depicts a classical reference , which allows us to define the phase shift in a meaningful way @xcite .",
    "the propagation of light through a heated sample with transmissivity @xmath67 can be decomposed into two distinct processes : first the single - mode gaussian beam undergoes the phase shift @xmath69 relative to the reference beam and then it undergoes a photon loss process , which is modeled with the help of a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath67 , where the second port is filled with light in the thermal state @xmath66.,width=294 ]      we choose to work with the single - mode gaussian states , which include the single - mode coherent and squeezed states , because this particular class of states is readily available with the current technology @xcite .",

    "hence , as long as @xmath153 , the sample s temperature is not disturbed significantly and our interferometric thermometer is noninvasive .",
    "the effect of disturbance can be included into our asymptotic error bounds by adding @xmath123 on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qfiboundsq ] ) and ( [ eq : qfiboundcoh ] ) .",
    "we note that by doing so we are combining in a single formula two different types of errors : the statistical error and the systematic error associated with the heating of the sample .",
    "however , this allows us to depict both of these errors neatly in the same figure .",
    "the resulting formulas for the asymptotic error of temperature estimation are given by @xmath154 for the squeezed - vacuum and coherent states , respectively . from the above formulas",
    ", we see that there is a maximum value @xmath155 of @xmath2 for which the error is minimal , and increasing @xmath2 from that point on would only decrease the precision because of the heating of the sample .",
    "this behavior is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] ( which was prepared for the ppktp crystal ; all necessary parameters for this material are given in the figure s caption ) , where for moderately small @xmath2 the error decreases , but eventually it starts to increase when growing @xmath2 disturbs the sample s temperature .",

    "the gray areas depict the precision regions lying below the asymptotic bound for the single - mode squeezed - vacuum state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpopr ] ) and lying above the asymptotic bound for the single - mode coherent state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcohpopr ] ) .",
    "the black dashed line represents the fundamental precision for the idealized pyrometer given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pyrometer ] ) with @xmath58 @xmath172 and @xmath57 ms.,width=294 ]      we compare the precision offered by our interferometric thermometer with the theoretical limit imposed on the idealized pyrometer that we found in sec .  [ sec : pyrometer ] .",
    "we perform this comparison for the ppktp crystal , which is commonly used in many quantum optics experiments , and its basic physical properties can be easily found @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations for the ppktp crystal near @xmath173 k are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] .",
    "as can be easily checked , the best precision achieved by our interferometric approach is @xmath174 nk for light with wavelength @xmath159 nm and @xmath175 photons prepared in the squeezed - vacuum state .",
    "this is much higher than the precision of the commercially available pyrometers and even higher than the theoretical limit for the idealized pyrometer of @xmath60 nk .",
    "naturally , a squeezed - vacuum state containing that many photons would be very hard to produce . ) , would be comparable to that of the commercially available pyrometers .",
    "] however , even for coherent input states , the precision of the interferometric thermometer is still excellent , with @xmath176 nk obtained with @xmath177 photons ( this number of photons at @xmath159 nm would correspond to a laser pulse energy of 0.1 mj and the average power of 100 mw at the repetition rate of 1 khz , which is easily accessible with current technology ) .",
    "therefore , we find that the interferometric thermometry does not need to use specially designed quantum states of light to surpass the classical optical thermometers .",
    "one could argue that our analysis is not comprehensive because we have not fully exploited all possible sources of information about the temperature in our setup .",
    "for example , we could have additionally tried to measure the mean number of thermal photons @xmath47 being radiated by the sample at frequency @xmath52 , which clearly is temperature dependent .",
    "furthermore , it very much depends on the type of the sample , but very often the transmissivity @xmath67 also depends on the temperature .",
    "therefore , we could have tried to estimate the temperature from @xmath67 as well .",
    "the qfis for estimation of @xmath47 and @xmath67 were already calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and , as we found , the estimation of these additional parameters provides negligible information about temperature when compared with the information obtained from the estimation of the optical phase .",
    "moreover , if , in spite of that , we still wished to estimate the mean number of thermal photons @xmath47 , then it would be optimal to send a vacuum state through the sample @xcite , which is equivalent to measuring the thermal radiation emitted by the sample at a _ single _ frequency @xmath52 , and interestingly provides information that we have already found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlefisher ] ) in the section devoted to the idealized pyrometers .",
    "in summary , we provided a detailed description of the quantum interferometric thermometer by analyzing the interaction between the single - mode gaussian states of light and a heated sample modeled as a dissipative thermal reservoir .",
    "we found that the single - mode squeezed - vacuum state is optimal for temperature measurement , offering precision in the nanokelvin range ; however , coherent input states provide an excellent performance as well .",
    "moreover , we also found a very elegant formula given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pyrometer ] ) that lower bounds the fundamental precision of the idealized pyrometer , which infers the temperature from a measurement of the total thermal radiation emitted by a heated sample .",
    "the interferometric thermometer provides a superior performance in temperature sensing even when compared with this idealized pyrometer .",
    "one of the main advantages of interferometric thermometry is its noninvasiveness , as highly precise temperature measurements can be obtained without disturbing the sample s temperature .",
    "we believe this feature to be crucial and hope that interferometric thermometers could be used , for example , for active temperature stabilization of nonlinear crystals such as the ppktp crystal .",
    "we note , however , that further studies are required to access the true performance of this method for temperature measurements in nonlinear crystals .",
    "those studies would need to take into account intrinsic noise sources such as the brownian and the thermodynamical noise sources that may be important for specific materials and setup geometries @xcite .",
    "apart from nonlinear crystals , we predict that interferometric thermometers should prove very useful for temperature measurements of atomic vapors . at the moment ,",
    "the most popular optical technique for temperature measurements in gaseous mediums such as atomic vapors is the absorption spectroscopy in which a laser light is shone on an atomic - vapor cell producing the absorption spectrum . in order to estimate the temperature of atomic vapor , it is then necessary to fit the observed spectrum to a theoretical model described by the so - called voigt profile , which accurately models the intensity profile of absorption spectral lines by including the contributions of natural linewidth and doppler broadening @xcite .",
    "this fitting procedure normally involves a prior knowledge of atomic - vapor parameters , such as the density of the vapor , which has a complicated dependence on the temperature . because of this , in practice ,",
    "the precision of this method is limited to , at most , @xmath1780.1 k @xcite , which is rather poor .",
    "furthermore , if we try to estimate the temperature of an atomic vapor by scanning the whole absorption spectrum , then we will very likely disturb its state when we probe it around resonant transitions @xcite .",
    "this is very problematic if we wish to use our atomic - vapor cell as a quantum memory .",
    "therefore , it is clear that an alternative , simpler method of temperature measurements for atomic vapors could be useful .",
    "we believe that our noninvasive interferometric approach is ideally suited for this kind of application and it would be of great interest to determine the fundamental precision offered by the interferometric thermometer for temperature measurements in realistic atomic vapors .",
    "finally , we note that interferometric thermometers operating at the telecom wavelengths of 1550 nm can also be readily used for temperature measurements of silicon semiconductor electronic devices , as silicon is almost transparent at these longer wavelengths .",
