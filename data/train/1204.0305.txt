    "ever since the seminal work of merton ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the problem of dynamic optimal investment and consumption occupied a central role in mathematical finance and financial economics .",
    "merton himself , together with many of the researchers that followed him , made the simplifying assumption of _ no market frictions _",
    ": there are no transaction costs , borrowing and lending occur at the same interest rate , the assets can be bought and sold immediately in any quantity and at the same price ( perfect liquidity ) , etc . among those , transaction costs are ( arguably ) among the most important and ( demonstrably ) the most studied .",
    "the problem of optimal investment where transactions cost are present has received ( and continues to receive ) considerable attention . following the early work of constantinides and magill @xcite , davis and norman @xcite considered a risky asset driven by the geometric brownian motion for which proportional transactions costs are levied on each transaction .",
    "these authors formulated the optimal investment / consumption problem as a singular stochastic control problem , and approached it using the method of dynamic programming . very early in the game",
    "it has been intuited , and later proved to varying degrees of rigor , that the optimal strategy has the following general form :    1 .",
    "the investor should not trade at all as long as his / her holdings stay within the so - called `` no - trade region '' - a wedge around the merton - proportion line",
    ". 2 .   outside the  no - trade region",
    ", the investor should trade so as to reach the no - trading region as soon as possible , and , then , adjust the portfolio in a minimal way in order not to leave it ever after",
    ".    such a strategy first appeared in @xcite and was later made more precise in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was subsequently complemented by that of shreve and soner @xcite who removed various technical conditions , and clarified the key arguments using the technique of viscosity solutions .",
    "still , even in @xcite , technical conditions needed to be imposed .",
    "most notably , the analysis there assumes that _ the problem is well posed _ , i.e. , that the value function is finite ; no necessary and sufficient condition for this assumption , in terms of the parameters of the model , is given in @xcite .",
    "in fact , to the best of our knowledge , the present paper provides the first such characterization .",
    "more recently , kallsen and muhle karbe @xcite approached the problem using the concept of a _ shadow price _ , first introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the shadow - price approach amounts to comparing the problem _ with _ transaction costs to a family of similar problems , but _ without _ transaction costs , whose risky - asset prices lie between the bid and ask prices of the original model .",
    "the most unfavorable of these prices is expected to yield the same utility as the original problem where transaction costs are paid . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this approach works quite well for the case of the logarithmic utility , which admits an explicit solution of the problem without transaction costs in a very general class of not - necessarily markovian models .",
    "the fact that the logarithmic utility is the only member of the crra ( power ) family of utility functions with that property makes a direct extension of their techniques seem difficult to implement . very recently , and in parallel with our work , partial results in this direction have been obtained by herczegh and prokaj @xcite whose approach ( and the intuition behind it ) is based on the second - order nonlinear free - boundary hjb equation of @xcite , and applies only to a rather restrictive range of parameters .",
    "our results apply to the model introduced @xcite or @xcite , and deal with _ general power - utility functions _ and _ general values of the parameters_. it is based on the shadow - price approach , but quite different in philosophy and execution from that of either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "our contributions can be divided into two groups :    _ novel treatment and proofs of , as well as insights into the existing results .",
    "_ we provide a new and complete path to the solution to the optimal investment / consumption problem with transaction costs and power - type utilities .",
    "our approach , based on the notion of the shadow price , is fully self - contained , does not rely on the dynamic programming principle and expresses all the features of the solution in terms of a solution to a single , constrained free - boundary problem for a one - dimensional first - order ode .",
    "this way , it is able to distinguish between various parameter regimes which remained hidden under the more abstract approach of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "interestingly , most of those regimes turn out to be `` singular '' , in the sense that our first - order ode develops a singularity in the right - hand side .",
    "while we are able to treat them fully , those cases require a much more delicate and insightful analysis .",
    "the results of both @xcite and @xcite apply only to the parameter regimes where no singularity is present .",
    "_ new results .",
    "_ one of the advantages of our approach is that it allows us to give an explicit characterization of the set of model parameters for which the optimal investment and consumption problem with transaction costs is well posed .",
    "as already mentioned above , to the best of our knowledge , such a characterization is new , and not present in the literature .    not only as another application , but also as an integral part of our proof , we furthermore prove that a shadow price exists whenever the problem is well - posed .",
    "finally , our techniques can be used to provide precise regularity information about all of the analytic ingredients , the value function being one of them .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we observe that in the singular case these are not always real - analytic , even when considered away from the free boundary .",
    "the set - up and the main results are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we describe the intuition and some technical considerations leading to our non - standard free - boundary problem . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove a verification - type result , i.e. , show how to solve the singular control problem , assuming that a smooth - enough solution for the free - boundary equation is available .",
    "the proof of existence of such a smooth solution is the most involved part of the paper . in order to make our presentation easier to parse",
    ", we split this proof into two parts .",
    "section 5 presents the main ideas of the proof , accompanied by graphical illustrations .",
    "the rigorous proofs follow in section 6 .",
    "we consider a model of a financial market in which the price process @xmath0 of the risky asset ( form simplicity called the `` stock '' ) is given by @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants - parameters of the model .",
    "the information structure is given by the natural saturated filtration generated by @xmath2 .",
    "an economic agent starts with @xmath5 shares of the stock and @xmath6 units of an interestless bond and invests in the two securities dynamically .",
    "transaction costs are not assumed away , and we model them as proportional to the size of the transaction .",
    "more precisely , they are determined by two constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 : one gets only @xmath9 for one share of the stock , but pays @xmath10 for it .",
    "we assume that the agent s initial position @xmath11 is * strictly solvent * , which means that it can be liquidated to a positive cash position .",
    "more precisely , we assume that @xmath12 where @xmath13    the agent s * ( consumption / trading ) strategy * is described by a triple @xmath14 of * optional * processes such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are right - continuous and of finite variation and @xmath17 is nonnegative and locally integrable , a.s . the processes",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath15 have the meaning of the amount of cash held in the money market and the number of shares in the risky asset , respectively , while @xmath17 is the consumption rate .    in order to incorporate the potential initial jump we distinguish between the initial values @xmath18 and the values @xmath19 ( after which the processes are right - continuous ) .",
    "this is quite typical for optimal investment / consumption strategies , both in frictional and frictionless markets , when the agent initially holds stocks , in addition to bonds . in this spirit",
    ", we always assume that @xmath20    a strategy @xmath14 is said to be * self - financing * if @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pathwise minimal ( hahn - jordan ) decomposition of @xmath15 into a difference of two non - decreasing adapted , right - continuous processes , _ with possible jumps at time zero _ , as we assume that @xmath23    the integrals used in ( [ equ : self - fin ] ) above , with respect to the ( pathwise stieltjes ) measures @xmath24 and @xmath25 characterized by @xmath26)= { { \\varphi}^{\\uparrow}}(b)-{{\\varphi}^{\\uparrow}}(a)$ ] , and @xmath27)= { { \\varphi}^{\\downarrow}}(b)-{{\\varphi}^{\\downarrow}}(a)$ ] , for @xmath28 together with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",

    "more precisely , for @xmath14 to belong to @xmath54 it is necessary and sufficient that the following three conditions hold    1 .",

    "\\(5 ) a straightforward ( but somewhat tedious ) calculation yields that @xmath853 , as @xmath854 , uniformly in @xmath832 $ ] .",
    "so , by ( 3 ) , we can choose @xmath855 such that @xmath856 for some @xmath658 and all @xmath826 , @xmath832 $ ] .",
    "also , we can check that there exists a constant @xmath855 such that for @xmath857 and @xmath858 we have @xmath859 whence the first inequality in the statement of ( 5 ) follows .",
    "the second one is obtained in a similar manner .",
    "\\(6 ) we first observe that @xmath860 and @xmath861 for @xmath827 .",
    "then , the statement follows from the integrability of @xmath862 on @xmath850 $ ] and the fact that @xmath863 , which is , in turn , implied by ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) above .",
    "[ rem : k ] in our current parameter range ( @xmath101 , @xmath428 ) , the level curve @xmath864 is a hyperbola and the curve @xmath450 is an ellipse for large - enough values of @xmath662 .",
    "in fact , @xmath815 is the smallest value of @xmath865 such that @xmath450 is a hyperbola ( and , therefore , unbounded ) .",
    "the parts of statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) involving singularities are proved similarly to parallel statements in proposition [ pro : second ] .",
    "we show that @xmath580 for @xmath400 , with the case @xmath407 being quite similar .",
    "proceeding by contradiction , we suppose that @xmath876 , for some @xmath871 .",
    "then , just like in the proof of proposition [ pro : second ] , we can show that @xmath759 does not admit a local minimum on @xmath877 .",
    "thus , there exists @xmath878 such that @xmath879 . from proposition",
    "[ k and lim ] , part ( 2 ) , we learn that @xmath880 $ ] , whereas from part ( 3 ) we conclude that there exists @xmath658 such that @xmath881 .",
    "since @xmath882 for large enough @xmath340 , we can use part ( 4 ) of proposition [ k and lim ] , to obtain a contradiction @xmath883 with the fact that the inequality @xmath884 implies that @xmath885 , for large @xmath340 .",
    "it remains to prove .",
    "the main idea is to intersect the solution @xmath386 with the ( unbounded ) level curve @xmath886 .",
    "if the two points of intersection are denoted by @xmath887 ( the intersection is on @xmath888 ) and @xmath889 ( intersection on @xmath890 ) , with @xmath891 ( see figure 8) , then the integral in is split into three integrals on the intervals @xmath892 $ ] , @xmath893 $ ] and @xmath894 $ ] .",
    "the first and the last integrals are then computed using the change of variable @xmath895 , while the limit of the middle integral is shown to be zero .",
    "we start this program by observing that the region @xmath896 is unbounded ( see proposition [ k and lim ] ( 2 ) ) , and , hence , so is the region @xmath897 . also , we observe that @xmath898 for @xmath899 .",
    "we conclude from there that @xmath397 intersects the region @xmath900 therefore , @xmath901 } { { g_{\\alpha}}}'(x)$ ] .",
    "since @xmath759 does nt admit a local minimum on @xmath902 , @xmath903 is uniquely defined and @xmath759 strictly increases on @xmath904 and strictly decreases on @xmath905 .",
    "consequently , there exists a pair @xmath906 with @xmath907 and @xmath908 such that @xmath909 let @xmath910\\mapsto [ \\alpha , x_u(\\alpha)]$ ] be the inverse function of @xmath759 on @xmath911 $ ] , so that @xmath912 where the last equality can be obtained by differentiating the middle one . a change of variables @xmath913 yields @xmath914 where the existence of the limit and its value are obtained using parts ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of proposition [ k and lim ] , together with the fact that @xmath915 .",
    "in particular , part ( 5 ) of proposition [ k and lim ] allows us to apply the dominated convergence theorem .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath916    it remains to show that @xmath917 as @xmath918 . by proposition [ k and lim ] ( parts ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) ,",
    "there exist @xmath658 and @xmath919 such that @xmath920 , for @xmath921 .",
    "moreover , part ( 2 ) of the same proposition guarantees the existence of a constant @xmath922 such that @xmath923 then , @xmath924 for @xmath925 and @xmath926 $ ] , and , so , for @xmath927 , we have @xmath928 where the first equality follows by direct computation , the second one by the fact that @xmath929 and @xmath930 , and the final inequality from the choice of @xmath345 .",
    "hence , @xmath931          for @xmath871 , the function @xmath386 in proposition [ pro : third ] corresponds to the value function @xmath90 under the transaction costs @xmath416 and @xmath934 such that @xmath936 , where @xmath937 .",
    "more precisely , lemma [ lem : complete - optimal ] in section 4  above yields that @xmath938 where @xmath939 is the optimal utility for the initial position @xmath940 , under the transaction costs @xmath416 and @xmath415 .",
    "the strict increase of @xmath462 and the decrease of @xmath941 , imply that @xmath942 is strictly decreasing , wherever it is defined .",
    "it now easily follows that @xmath943 which , together with and the representation , yields that @xmath944 .",
    "since , clearly , @xmath945 is decreasing in @xmath416 , this amounts to saying that @xmath946    the map @xmath947 is strictly decreasing in general , not just under the parameters restricted by the hypothesis of proposition [ prop : wellposed ] . the same argument , as the one given in the proof of proposition [ prop : wellposed ] , applies .",
    "in particular , this fact can be used to show that the free - boundary problem , has a _ unique _",
    "solution for all values of the transaction costs , as long as @xmath357 .",
    "it is , perhaps , interesting to note that the authors are unable to come up with a purely analytic argument for the monotonicity of @xmath942 .",
    "the crucial step in the proof of proposition [ prop : wellposed ] above is to relate the value of @xmath942 to the original control problem , and then argue by using the natural monotonicity properties of the control problem itself , rather than the analytic description only .",
