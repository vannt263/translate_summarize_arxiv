    "the existence of a @xmath9 unstable bound state , the @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 resonance , about 27 mev below the @xmath13 threshold was first discussed by dalitz et al .",
    "@xcite and shown to be compatible with strong coupled - channel vector - meson exchange @xmath14-wave interactions in the @xmath10 @xmath15 system .",
    "this strongly attractive @xmath10 @xmath9 interaction , plus the moderately attractive @xmath16 @xmath9 interaction @xcite , suggest that the @xmath1-_nuclear _ interaction is also strongly attractive . indeed , the born approximation for the @xmath1-nucleus optical potential constructed from the leading - order tomozawa - weinberg ( tw ) vector coupling term of the chiral effective lagrangian @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 mev is the pseudoscalar meson decay constant , yields sizable attraction @xmath19 mev for a central nuclear density @xmath20 @xmath21 . iterating the tw term plus next - to - leading - order terms , within an _ in - medium _ coupled - channel approach constrained by the @xmath22 data near the @xmath9 threshold , roughly doubles this @xmath1-nucleus attraction to about @xmath23 mev at @xmath24 .",
    "it is found in these calculations ( e.g. @xcite ) that the @xmath11 quickly dissolves in the nuclear medium at finite densities , well below @xmath24 , so that the repulsive free - space scattering length @xmath25 becomes _ attractive _ , and together with the weakly density dependent attractive @xmath26 it yields a strongly attractive density - dependent @xmath27 @xmath1-nucleus optical potential : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath9 reduced mass and the in - medium isoscalar @xmath9 scattering length @xmath30 ( positive for attraction in the sign convention common in this field ) is defined by @xmath31 however , when @xmath32 is calculated _ self consistently _ , namely by including @xmath32 in the in - medium propagator used in the lippmann - schwinger equation determining @xmath32 as a @xmath1-nucleus t matrix , the resultant @xmath1-nucleus potential is only moderately attractive , with depth between 40 and 60  mev @xcite .",
    "we call such @xmath1-nucleus potentials ` shallow ' .",
    "in contrast , strongly attractive @xmath1-nucleus potentials , of depth between 150 and 200 mev , appear to provide the best fit to the comprehensive @xmath0 atomic data which consist of level shifts and widths across the periodic table @xcite .",
    "we call such @xmath1-nucleus potentials ` deep ' , noting that the fits provided by such ` deep ' potentials to the @xmath0 atomic data are by far superior to those provided by the ` shallow ' potentials @xcite .",
    "another approach to the construction of @xmath32 in dense nuclear matter has been the relativistic - mean - field ( rmf ) approach where in addition to an attractive lorentz - vector mean potential , similar in its origin to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiral ] ) , an attractive lorentz - scalar mean potential associated with the poorly known sigma term is included @xcite .",
    "this approach too yields a strongly attractive @xmath32 , the precise extent of attraction depending on the phenomenological constraints imposed on the rmf calculation . assuming dominance of the lorentz - vector mean potential proportional to @xmath33",
    ", one could test the implications of partial restoration of chiral symmetry , in the sense originally proposed for pionic atoms @xcite , by replacing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiral ] ) @xmath34 by a density dependent decay constant @xmath35 according to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the pion - nucleon sigma term @xcite .",
    "this implies a specific density dependence of the optical potential ( [ eq : trho ] ) : @xmath38 where the @xmath39 @xmath37 term is given in mev and @xmath40 is the nuclear density in @xmath21 .",
    "this chirally motivated density dependence has proved successful in pionic atoms @xcite and in low energy pion scattering @xcite where its effect can be separated from similar effects due to the threshold energy dependence of the underlying @xmath39 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-nuclear interaction is also strongly absorptive , which arises from the available one - nucleon absorption reactions @xmath41 with approximately 100 and 180 mev energy release for the final hyperons ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . among the known hadron - nucleus interactions at low energies , only the @xmath45-nucleus interaction is as strongly attractive and absorptive as the @xmath1-nucleus interaction @xcite .",
    "recent experimental reports on candidates for @xmath1-nuclear deeply bound states in the range of binding energy @xmath6  mev @xcite again highlighted the question of how attractive the @xmath1-nucleus interaction is below the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "obviously , the ` shallow'-type potentials can not generate deeply bound nuclear states in the energy range @xmath6 mev , whereas the ` deep ' potentials might do .",
    "the distinction between ` deep ' and ` shallow ' @xmath1-nucleus potentials becomes somewhat fuzzy within a _ dynamical _ approach which allows for polarization of the nucleus by the strong @xmath1-nucleus interaction .",
    "the depth of the @xmath1-nucleus potential becomes then state dependent , thus depending on the binding energy @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , strong polarization of the nucleus by the @xmath1 interaction was established in our recent rmf calculations for the light nuclei @xmath47c and @xmath48o @xcite .",
    "consequences of such polarization are a central topic of the present work .",
    "in section 2 we re - analyze the existing @xmath0 atomic data in order to gain information on the density dependence of the @xmath1-nuclear optical potential in the nuclear surface and to extrapolate smoothly to nuclear matter density .",
    "this procedure yields a ` deep ' attractive potential of about 170 mev at @xmath4 .",
    "we also test whether starting from a ` shallow'-type potential @xcite , and superimposing on it a density dependence of the form eq .",
    "( [ equ : wdd ] ) , could improve the fit to the @xmath0-atom data as it appears to do in pionic atoms and in low - energy pion - nuclear scattering @xcite . for @xmath0 atoms",
    "the answer is in the negative , perhaps because the nonperturbative aspect of the @xmath11 dominance at the low density regime encountered in kaonic atoms invalidates the chiral perturbation counting rules @xcite .",
    "this does not rule out a greater role for partial chiral restoration of a similar sort at higher densities , and for deeply bound @xmath1-_nuclear _ states , or for kaon condensation as discussed first by brown et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the case for @xmath1-nucleus bound states with @xmath49 mev , generated by a ` deep ' potential , was made by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite who fitted the underlying @xmath50 matrix to a _ partial _ set of the available low - energy @xmath9 data . for the most recent publication that elaborates on their calculations for very light nuclear cores , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in these few - body calculations ,",
    "the strongly attractive @xmath1-nucleus interaction caused a substantial polarization , or rearrangement of the nuclear core .",
    "in our _ dynamical _ rmf calculations @xcite , the @xmath1 and the nucleons interact through the exchange of scalar ( @xmath37 ) and vector ( @xmath51 ) meson fields which are treated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the presence of @xmath1 induces additional source terms in the equations of motion for the meson fields to which the @xmath1 couples .",
    "this affects the scalar and vector potentials which enter the dirac equation for nucleons and leads to rearrangement of the nuclear core .",
    "it also leads to a deeper @xmath1-nuclear potential with respect to _",
    "static _ calculations which assume a rigid nuclear core ( an assumption that is justified for @xmath0 and @xmath52 atoms @xcite ) . by successively allowing the @xmath1 to polarize the nucleons , and the polarized nucleus to enhance the @xmath1-nuclear interaction , this dynamical calculation",
    "is made self consistent .",
    "similar @xmath45-nucleus rmf calculations have been reported by the frankfurt group @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to study the dynamical aspects of the @xmath1-nucleus coupling across the periodic table , and in particular to study the widths expected for deeply bound states over a wide range of binding energies .",
    "this is done by scanning on the coupling constants of the @xmath1 - meson fields . in section 3",
    "we outline the @xmath1-nucleus rmf methodology used in this work and discuss its extension to describe absorptive interactions by which the @xmath1-nuclear bound states acquire a width .",
    "the calculation of the width is also done dynamically , since its evaluation requires the nonstatic nuclear density and the binding energy which determines the reduced phase space available to the absorption reactions , and both of these quantities keep changing from one step of the iterative solution of the equations of motion to the next .",
    "the imaginary part of the potential affects also nonnegligibly the calculated binding energy .",
    "this important aspect of the @xmath1-nucleus dynamics is missing in the very recent rmf calculation by zhong et al . @xcite . in section 4",
    "we show and discuss the results of calculations across the periodic table .",
    "special attention is paid to @xmath47c and other light nuclear targets for which a recent finuda experiment at da@xmath7ne , frascati , claimed evidence for deeply bound @xmath8 states @xcite .",
    "we find large dynamical effects for light nuclei such as @xmath47c and we discuss these in detail .",
    "section 5 summarizes the present work with conclusions and outlook .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the motivation for re - analysis of a comprehensive set of kaonic atoms data is two fold .",
    "first is the question of ` deep ' _ vs. _ ` shallow ' real @xmath1-nucleus potential , in light of recent possible experimental evidence for the existence of deeply bound kaonic states whose binding energies exceed the depth of the shallow type of potential obtained from fits to kaonic atoms data .",
    "such shallow potentials are obtained when fits to the data are made with a simple ` @xmath53 ' approach , as described below , and also when self - consistent approaches are used @xcite . however",
    ", if the deep variety of potential is confirmed , then the dependence of the @xmath9 interaction on the nuclear density becomes of prime concern .",
    "this density dependence is the second point which motivated the re - analysis of kaonic atoms data although there have not been any new experimental results on strong interaction effects in kaonic atoms since the early 1990 s .",
    "the method adopted here is rather similar to our earlier work @xcite , namely , performing global fits to a large set of data which covers the whole of the periodic table , using an optical potential within the klein - gordon equation , @xmath54{\\psi } = 0~~ ~~ ( \\hbar = c = 1),\\ ] ] where @xmath55 denotes the static coulomb potential for the @xmath1 due to the finite charge distribution of the nucleus , including the first - order @xmath56 vacuum - polarization potential , @xmath57 is the @xmath1-nucleus reduced mass and @xmath58 , with @xmath46 and @xmath59 standing for the binding energy and width , respectively .",
    "the interaction of @xmath1 with the nucleus is described here in terms of an optical potential @xmath60 which in the simplest ` @xmath53 ' form is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the neutron and proton density distributions normalized to the number of neutrons @xmath64 and number of protons @xmath65 , respectively , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the mass of the nucleon . in the impulse approximation",
    "` @xmath53 ' approach the parameter @xmath68 is equal to the @xmath1-nucleon isoscalar scattering length under the sign convention common in this field , otherwise this parameter may be regarded as ` effective ' and its value is obtained from fits to the data . for @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ equ : potl ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : trho ] ) discussed above in the context of nuclear matter . an isovector term is not included in eq .",
    "( [ equ : potl ] ) as earlier analyses showed @xcite that such a term is not required by fits to kaonic atoms data .",
    "compared to the previous analyses we have now used a modified set of parameters for the nuclear densities .",
    "the density distribution of the protons is usually considered known as it is obtained from the nuclear charge distribution by unfolding the finite size of the charge of the proton .",
    "the neutron distributions are , however , generally not known to sufficient accuracy .",
    "experience with pionic atoms @xcite and with antiprotonic atoms @xcite showed that the feature of neutron density distributions which is most relevant in determining strong interaction effects in exotic atoms is the radial extent , as represented for example by @xmath70 , the neutron density rms radius .",
    "other features such as the detailed shape of the distribution have only minor effect .",
    "this is observed also for kaonic atoms where the dependence of the quality of fits on the densities of the neutrons is less than what is observed for pionic and antiprotonic atoms .",
    "the neutron densities used in the present work were of the two - parameter fermi shape and of the ` skin ' variety , as detailed in ref .",
    "the values of @xmath70 were those that yielded the best fit to pionic and antiprotonic atoms data .    with the potential eq .",
    "( [ equ : potl ] ) and varying the complex parameter @xmath68 we obtain the same results as before @xcite when the data span a range of nuclei from @xmath71li to @xmath72u .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is marginally larger than the corresponding value found in @xcite because of the slightly different nuclear densities used in the two calculations .",
    "the depth of the real potential for a typical medium - weight to heavy nucleus is about 80 mev .",
    "recall that the corresponding value for the shallow - type potentials is close to 55 mev @xcite .",
    "the possibility of departure of the antikaon - nucleus potential from the simple ` @xmath53 ' form had been studied over a decade ago @xcite and significant improvement in the fit to the data had been achieved .",
    "the empirical parameter @xmath68 was made density dependent ( dd ) by replacing @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : potl ] ) by @xmath74^\\alpha~\\ ] ] where @xmath75 . in this way it was possible to respect the ` low density limit ' ( when @xmath76 ) by keeping @xmath68 fixed at its free @xmath9 value and varying the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "in view of the importance of the modification of the @xmath9 interaction in nuclear matter we have addressed this question again in the present work in a different way .",
    "we _ loosely _ define in coordinate space an ` internal ' region and an ` external ' region by using the multiplicative functions @xmath79 in the former and @xmath80 $ ] in the latter , where @xmath79 is defined as @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "then clearly @xmath83 when @xmath84 , which is the internal region . likewise @xmath85~\\rightarrow~1",

    "thus @xmath86 forms an approximate border between the internal and the external regions , and _ if _",
    "@xmath86 is close to the nuclear surface then the two regions will correspond to the high density and low density regions of nuclear matter , respectively .",

    "this requirement is motivated by the recent calculations of yamagata et al .",
    "@xcite according to which the @xmath100 production cross section in @xmath102 reactions is higher than for the @xmath101 state .",
    "the requirement @xmath99 mev for the @xmath100 state in @xmath98c is satisfied using kaon coupling constants only slightly different than those found optimal for the @xmath0 atomic fit of ref .",
    "the width of this @xmath100 state , 89 mev , is close to the value 95 mev listed in table [ tab:1s ] for the @xmath101 state constrained to the same binding energy .",
    "the @xmath101 states calculated in this case for the two nuclei are narrower than the respective @xmath100 states , simply because their widths are suppressed stronger by the phase - space suppression factor @xmath103 .",
    "the increase in @xmath104 for these deeply bound @xmath101 states provided by going from the static calculation to the dynamical one is very substantial , with exceptionally large value of 71 mev due to the strong polarization that the @xmath105li nucleus undergoes due to a deeply bound @xmath0 .",
    "we note that for very shallow bound states , as demonstrated here for the @xmath97li @xmath100 state and as will be shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynam ] below for the @xmath98c @xmath101 state , there is little difference between the static and the dynamical calculations for @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast , the width @xmath106 is very strongly enhanced in @xmath97li owing to the increase of the nuclear density provided by the dynamical calculation , from 71 mev in the static calculation to 184 mev in the dynamical calculation for the @xmath100 state .",
    "although the width of the @xmath101 state hardly changes , it would have decreased by roughly factor of two due to the phase - space suppression factor @xmath103 if the increase of the nuclear density did not offset this decrease .",

    "[ fig : dynam ] as a function of the coupling - constant strenghts .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath113 mev the dynamical calculation gives higher binding than the static calculation does , with the binding - energy gain increasing monotonically with @xmath104 , and this effect becomes important for @xmath114 mev .",
    "the effect on @xmath106 is more intricate : the dynamically calculated width is larger than the width calculated statically , except in the region around @xmath115 mev where the kinematical phase - space suppression factor @xmath103 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spf ] ) decreases rapidly . in this region",
    ", the dynamically calculated @xmath106 corresponds to binding energy @xmath104 which is associated with a considerably more suppressed value of @xmath103 than in the static calculation , and this effect wins over the width gained by the increased nuclear density .",
    "we note that the width calculated dynamically for the @xmath101 nuclear state in @xmath98c does not fall below 50 mev for the range of variation shown , whereas the corresponding limiting value of the statically calculated width is about 35 mev .",
    "another feature shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynam ] concerns the effect of the imaginary potential on the binding energy : the dynamically calculated binding energy @xmath104 when im@xmath60 is switched off is shown by the dotted line .",

    "however , the width of these states is large , close to 100 mev .",
    "we conclude that although this ansatz for density dependence did not improve the fit to kaonic atoms data where the need to introduce phenomenological density dependence appears at low densities , its role in the higher nuclear density regime @xcite and for generating nuclear @xmath1 bound states can not be ruled out at present .",
    "in this work we re - analyzed the data on strong - interaction effects in @xmath0 atoms across the periodic table in order to study the density dependence of @xmath32 and its extrapolation into nuclear - matter densities . a departure from the @xmath2 dependence",

    "partial restoration of chiral symmetry , such as discussed in low energy pion - nuclear physics , was found to be ineffective at this low - density regime , but its role at higher densities can not be ruled out . a smooth extrapolation into the nuclear interior gave a _ deep _ @xmath1 nuclear potential @xmath32 which would allow the existence of @xmath1 nuclear bound states even for a static calculation .",
    "we then extended the purely nuclear rmf model by coupling the @xmath1 _ dynamically _ to the nucleus .",
    "negligible polarization effects were found for _ atomic _ states , which confirms the optical - potential phenomenology of kaonic atoms in general , and as a valid starting point for the present study in particular .",
    "binding energies and widths of @xmath1 _ nuclear _ bound states were then calculated across the periodic table with the aim of placing lower limits on the widths expected for binding energies in the range of @xmath123 mev .",
    "substantial polarization of the nucleus was found in light nuclei such as @xmath47c and @xmath48o for deeply bound @xmath1 nuclear states , resulting in locally increased nuclear densities up to about @xmath124 .",
    "an almost universal shape was found for the dependence of the @xmath1 width on its binding energy .",
    "the widths are primarily suppressed by the reduced phase - space for absorption of @xmath1 , and are enhanced by the increased density of the polarized nucleus .",

    "our calculated widths for a @xmath0 @xmath101 or @xmath100 bound state in @xmath47c , in the kinematical region of the finuda signal , are about 90 mev which is somewhat larger than the reported width .",
    "we noted that a @xmath100 bound state in @xmath47c , rather than @xmath101 bound state , is compatible with the ` deep ' type of @xmath0-nucleus potential fitted to the atomic data and perhaps also with deeply bound @xmath0 @xmath101 states in the range @xmath127 mev for lighter nuclear targets such as @xmath128he @xcite .",
    "we have argued that if the finuda observed signal corresponds to a @xmath1 bound state in @xmath47c , then it is unlikely to arise in li targets , thus emphasizing the need to get statistically significant data from separate nuclear targets . for lighter nuclear targets , where the rmf approach becomes unreliable but where nuclear polarization effects are found much larger using few - body calculational methods @xcite , we anticipate larger widths than 50 mev for @xmath1 deeply bound states in the range @xmath129 mev .",

    "<S> a comprehensive data base of @xmath0-atom level shifts and widths is re - analyzed in order to study the density dependence of the @xmath1-nuclear optical potential . </S>",
    "<S> significant departure from a @xmath2 form is found only for @xmath3 and extrapolation to nuclear - matter density @xmath4 yields an attractive potential , about 170  mev deep . </S>",
    "<S> partial restoration of chiral symmetry compatible with pionic atoms and low - energy pion - nuclear data plays no role at the relevant low - density regime , but this effect is not ruled out at densities of order @xmath4 and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1-nuclear bound states are generated across the periodic table self consistently , using a relativistic mean - field model lagrangian which couples the @xmath1 to the scalar and vector meson fields mediating the nuclear interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced phase space available for @xmath1 absorption from these bound states is taken into account by adding an energy - dependent imaginary term which underlies the corresponding @xmath1-nuclear level widths , with a strength required by fits to the atomic data . </S>",
    "<S> substantial polarization of the core nucleus is found for light nuclei , and the binding energies and widths calculated in this dynamical model differ appreciably from those calculated for a static nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of binding energies is spanned by varying the @xmath1 couplings to the meson fields . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations provide a lower limit of @xmath5 mev on the width of nuclear bound states for @xmath1 binding energy in the range @xmath6 mev . </S>",
    "<S> comments are made on the interpretation of the finuda experiment at da@xmath7ne which claimed evidence for deeply bound @xmath8 states in light nuclei . </S>"
