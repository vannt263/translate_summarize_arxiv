    "the polarization properties of light are described by the four stokes parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath3 is the intensity .",
    "linear polarization is described by @xmath4 and @xmath6 , and circular polarization by @xmath5 . in general , the absorption coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 for left- and right - handed circularly polarized light , and @xmath9 for linearly polarized radiation traveling perpendicular to the magnetic field , are not equal at a given wavelength .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 correspond to transitions where the magnetic quantum number changes by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the absorption coefficients , normalized to the rosseland mean opacity ( ) , are defined by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "these absorption coefficients are combined into @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 denotes the angle between the magnetic field direction and the line of sight . when the magneto - optical parameters ( faraday rotation ) and ( voigt effect ) originating from spectral lines and free electrons in a magnetic field ( see jordan et al .",
    "1992 ) are taken into account , the three radiative transport equations of unno ( 1956 ) expand into four equations ( beckers 1969 ) : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    the optical depth scale is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the angle between the normal to the surface and the line of sight ( along which the @xmath26 axis of the local coordinate system on each surface element points ) .",
    "the @xmath27 axis is defined by the direction of the projection of the magnetic field vector onto the plane of the sky .",
    "@xmath28 completes the right - handed coordinate system .",
    "@xmath29 is the source function ( the planck formula in the case of lte ) .    in the case of large faraday rotation , radiative",
    "transfer can be described in the framework of generalized stokes parameters , with @xmath30 being the ordinary mode and @xmath31 being the extraordinary mode . for the ordinary mode",
    "the electric field vector , the magnetic field , and the direction of propagation are in one plane ; for the extraordinary mode the plane of propagation and the electric field vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the phase relation between the two modes is given by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , which correspond to two polarization ellipses , the so - called normal modes .",
    "we have used three different methods to solve the radiative transfer equations formally : ( a ) the slightly modified martin und wickramasinghe ( m&w , 1979 ) , ( b ) an accelerated lambda iteration scheme ( ali ) , ( c ) an approximation for large faraday rotation ( approx ) , or ( d ) an analytical procedure using matrix exponential function ( matexp ) .",
    "the solution is based on the assumption that the source function is linear in the optical depth and that between two successive depth points the stokes parameters can be described by @xmath34 this assumption is inserted into the four radiative transfer equations , using an unno ( 1956 ) condition at the inner boundary .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath35 , as well as @xmath36 , are evaluated by comparing the constant , linear , and exponential terms on both sides of the equations .",
    "one obtains finally a relatively simple scheme , by which the transport equations can be solved from the inner depth points to the outside .",
    "this powerful and very flexible method is described in more detail by deetjen et al . in these proceedings .",
    "this method uses generalized stokes parameters ( ramaty 1969 ) .",
    "of particular interest is the limiting case of large faraday rotation , which is always valid in the case of magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "this means that the rotation between two depth points is larger than @xmath37 , and the phase relation between the polarization ellipses @xmath38 and @xmath39 can assume arbitrary values ; @xmath40 on the average .",
    "then the transfer equations decouple ( ramaty 1969 ) : @xmath41 according to vth &  chanmugam ( 1995 ) the formal solution ( using a linear approximation of the source function ) of this equation can be written as @xmath42\\\\             & & + i_+(\\tau_{i\\pm1})e^{-{\\alpha_+}\\delta\\tau/\\mu}\\\\ i_-(\\tau_i)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_b(1-e^{-{\\alpha_-}\\delta\\tau/\\mu } )                \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\beta_b}{\\alpha_- }                \\left[\\alpha_+(\\tau_i-\\tau_{i+1}e^{-{\\alpha_-}\\delta\\tau/\\mu } )                                       -(1-e^{-{\\alpha_-}\\delta\\tau/\\mu})\\right]\\\\             & & + i_-(\\tau_{i\\pm1})e^{-{\\alpha_-}\\delta\\tau/\\mu}\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      a direct analytical way to solve the radiative transfer equations uses matrix exponential functions .",

    "the matrix @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "we assume a linear source function between successive depth points : @xmath50 .",
    "if we define @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and take into account that @xmath56 can be become imaginary if magneto - optical parameters are present ( a case that has been neglected by dittmann 1995 ) , then the coefficients are given by : @xmath57 \\\\",

    "large magneto - optical parameters @xmath58 , and the expressions can be somewhat simplified .",
    "in all tests , the resulting spectra and polarization turned out to be very similar for the four different approaches .",
    "small numerical instabilities in the case of the m&w and the matexp algorithms lead to small oscillations of the stokes parameters ( particularly @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) in the vicinity of spectral lines ; thsese are caused by the terms containing @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , or @xmath62 .",
    "the ali method , having the potential to account for nlte and scattering is numerically very stable .",
    "however , the approx method is about a factor of 11 faster and very stable and should therefore be preferred for practical purposes . for final fits to observations",
    "it is always possible to use the ali method for comparison .",
