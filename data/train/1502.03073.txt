    "for quantum fields on black hole space - times , the hartle - hawking state represents a black hole in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at the hawking temperature @xcite . on a non - rotating black hole space - time",

    ", the hartle - hawking state would represent a rotating heat bath in thermal equilibrium at the hawking temperature . for a quantum scalar field ,",
    "such a state is ill - defined everywhere outside the event horizon @xcite , unless the black hole is enclosed inside a reflecting boundary sufficiently close to the event horizon @xcite . on the other hand , for a fermion field",
    ", it is possible to define a rotating thermal equilibrium state on a rotating black hole space - time , but this state is divergent far from the black hole event horizon @xcite .    in order to understand this fundamental difference between the behaviour of bosonic and fermionic quantum fields on a rotating black hole space - time , it is instructive to study the toy model of a rigidly - rotating thermal state for a quantum field on minkowski space - time .",
    "considering unbounded minkowski space - time , rigidly - rotating thermal states are ill - defined everywhere for bosonic fields @xcite but can be defined for fermionic fields @xcite . however , rotating thermal states for fermions become singular far from the axis of rotation @xcite , mimicking the behaviour of rotating thermal states on black hole space - times @xcite .",
    "if instead we consider a quantum scalar field on minkowski space - time bounded by a cylinder enclosing the axis of rotation , then , if the radius of the cylinder is sufficiently small , regular rigidly - rotating thermal states can be defined @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a quantum fermion field inside a cylinder in minkowski space - time , and construct rigidly - rotating thermal states .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the modes of a quantum fermion field on unbounded rotating minkowski space - time , and the definition and properties of rotating vacuum and thermal states @xcite . with the cylinder present , we consider two possible boundary conditions on the fermion field , namely the spectral @xcite and mit bag @xcite boundary conditions .",
    "we discuss some of the properties of rotating thermal expectation values when the boundary is not too far from the axis of rotation .",
    "we also outline the behaviour of casimir expectation values near the boundary . throughout",
    "we restrict attention to massless fermions .",
    "further details and the massive case will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results have previously appeared in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be cylindrical polar coordinates for minkowski space . setting @xmath1 , and @xmath2",
    ", we obtain the metric for rotating minkowski space - time : @xmath3 where @xmath4 an observer at fixed @xmath5 rotates around the @xmath6-axis with angular speed @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 , such an observer must have speed greater than the speed of light .",
    "the surface on which @xmath9 and @xmath10 is therefore called the _ speed of light surface _ ( sol ) .",
    "the dirac equation for massless fermions on the space - time ( [ eq : metric ] ) takes the form @xmath11 \\psi(x ) = 0 ,    \\label{eq : dirac}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the rotating hamiltonian , @xmath13 is the @xmath6-component of the angular momentum and @xmath14 is the momentum operator .",
    "hatted indices represent tensor components with respect to a tetrad @xmath15 .",
    "the gamma matrices @xmath16 are in the dirac representation and satisfy @xmath17 , while their covariant counterparts @xmath18 satisfy @xmath19 .",
    "mode solutions of ( [ eq : dirac ] ) with minkowski energy @xmath20 , @xmath6-axis momentum @xmath21 , @xmath6-axis angular momentum @xmath22 and helicity @xmath23 take the form : @xmath24 the two - spinor @xmath25 introduced above is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a bessel function of the first kind . in ( [ eq : modes ] , [ eq : phi ] ) , we have introduced @xmath28 , which is the eigenvalue of the rotating hamiltonian @xmath29 , and the momentum @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the transverse momentum .    the definition of vacuum and thermal states for fermions on the unbounded space - time ( [ eq : metric ] ) is discussed in detail in @xcite . constructing a vacuum state",
    "depends crucially on the choice of positive frequency for the modes ( [ eq : modes ] ) .",
    "a rotating thermal state at inverse temperature @xmath32 is built up from the chosen vacuum state by thermally populating the modes ( [ eq : modes ] ) using the rotating hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the appropriate energy in the planck factor in thermal expectation values ( t.e.v.s ) is @xmath34 .",
    "there are two particular choices of positive frequency ( and hence vacuum state ) which are of interest :    * choosing @xmath35 @xcite leads to the nonrotating minkowski vacuum .",
    "defining rotating thermal states relative to this vacuum leads to t.e.v.s which have spurious temperature - independent terms @xcite . *",
    "on the other hand , choosing @xmath36 @xcite gives a rotating vacuum which is distinct from the nonrotating minkowski vacuum .",
    "relative to this vacuum , t.e.v.s for rotating thermal states do not contain the above spurious temperature - independent terms .    for both choices of the vacuum state ,",
    "the t.e.v.s are regular within the sol but diverge as the sol is approached and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we now consider rotating minkowski space - time ( [ eq : metric ] ) with a cylindrical boundary at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 so that the cylinder is inside or on the sol .",
    "boundary conditions must be imposed on the fermion modes ( [ eq : modes ] ) in order that the rotating hamiltonian @xmath33 is self - adjoint .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath33 will be self - adjoint if , for any two solutions @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac ] ) , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dirac inner product and @xmath44 is the boundary of the volume @xmath45 . for a cylindrical boundary at @xmath46 , the surface integral in ( [ eq : sa ] ) takes the form @xmath47 we consider two implementations of the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc ] ) , namely the spectral @xcite and mit bag @xcite boundary conditions .",
    "spectral boundary conditions @xcite are constructed by considering the fourier transform of a fermion spinor @xmath40 with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath48 : @xmath49 using this notation , in order for the rotating hamiltonian @xmath33 to be self - adjoint , it must be the case that @xmath50 for any @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfying the dirac equation . by considering the charge conjugate @xmath53 of the spinor @xmath40",
    ", a second condition for self - adjointness of the hamiltonian is found : @xmath54 to satisfy the two equations ( [ eq : spectral1 ] , [ eq : spectral2 ] ) , we set @xmath55 if @xmath56 and @xmath57 if @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "this means that the transverse momentum @xmath31 is quantized so that @xmath59 due to the application of the fourier transform in the above derivation , the spectral boundary conditions are nonlocal in the sense that the integrand in ( [ eq : bc ] ) does not vanish at each point on the boundary , but the integral in ( [ eq : bc ] ) is zero .",
    "the spectral boundary conditions can be applied separately to modes of positive and negative helicity .    using known properties of the zeros of the bessel functions @xmath27 @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that , for transverse momenta @xmath60 satisfying ( [ eq : bcspectral ] ) , we have @xmath61 . hence , for @xmath35 , @xmath62 therefore @xmath63 for all values of the quantum numbers @xmath21 and @xmath64 as long as the boundary is inside or on the sol ( @xmath65 ) .      in the mit bag model @xcite , the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc ] ) is satisfied by ensuring that the integrand vanishes at any point @xmath66 on the boundary .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the normal to the boundary . unlike the spectral boundary condition ,",
    "the mit bag boundary condition ( [ eq : mit ] ) does not commute with the helicity operator and so the spinor @xmath40 must be a linear combination of positive and negative helicity modes : @xmath69 where the @xmath70 are constants and the spinors @xmath71 are given in ( [ eq : modes ] ) .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq : mit ] ) then reduces to a pair of linear equations for the constants @xmath70 which have a nontrivial solution only if @xmath72    properties of the solutions @xmath73 of ( [ eq : bcmit ] ) are studied in @xcite . using theorems 3.1 and 3.2 from @xcite , together with known properties of the zeros of the bessel functions @xmath27 and their derivatives @xmath74 @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath61 for transverse momenta @xmath60 satisfying ( [ eq : bcmit ] ) @xcite . hence , as in the spectral case , we have @xmath63 for all values of the quantum numbers @xmath21 and @xmath64 as long as the boundary is inside or on the sol ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "for both spectral and mit bag boundary conditions , the fact that @xmath63 for all field modes means that the possible choices of positive frequency ( namely @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) are the same when the boundary is inside or on the sol . therefore , in this case the vilenkin @xcite and iyer @xcite quantizations are equivalent , or , in other words , the rotating and nonrotating vacua coincide .    rotating thermal states at inverse temperature @xmath32 are defined relative to this vacuum state by thermally populating the field modes satifying either the spectral or mit bag boundary conditions , using the rotating hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "we are interested in t.e.v.s of the component of the neutrino charge current @xmath75 ( all other components of the neutrino charge current vanish ) and the components of the stress - energy tensor @xmath76 .",
    "expressions for these expectation values written as mode sums are rather lengthy ( particularly for the stress - energy tensor ) and will be presented elsewhere , together with detailed derivations @xcite . here",
    "we present a selection of results for the spectral and mit bag boundary conditions .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ fig:2 ] we show rotating t.e.v.s when the boundary is inside the sol and the temperature is high , comparing the t.e.v.s for the spectral and mit bag boundary conditions with those for the unbounded rotating space - time @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that , away from the boundary , the rotating t.e.v.s with both the spectral and mit bag boundary conditions follow closely the profiles for unbounded rotating minkowski space - time . however , there are significant differences in behaviour near the boundary .",
    "the neutrino charge current vanishes on the boundary in the mit bag case , and is positive on the boundary for spectral boundary conditions . the energy density @xmath77 near the boundary is lower in the bounded case compared with the unbounded space - time .",
    "this drop in energy density is particularly marked in the case of spectral boundary conditions .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig:2 ] show significant differences in rotating t.e.v.s near the boundary depending on the boundary conditions applied ( or no boundary conditions in the case of the unbounded space - time ) . to explore these boundary effects further",
    ", we close this paper by considering casimir expectation values @xmath78 , defined as the difference between _ vacuum _ expectation values for the nonrotating vacuum states on the bounded and unbounded minkowski space - times .",
    "this difference in vacuum expectation values diverges as the boundary is approached .",
    "the leading - order behaviour of this divergence can be found analytically using asymptotic analysis @xcite .",
    "we find the following expressions , for spectral and mit bag boundary conditions respectively ( see @xcite for the mit bag result ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 . both expectation values in ( [ eq : casimir ] ) diverge as @xmath81 and the boundary is approached .",
    "the @xmath82 divergence for the mit bag boundary conditions agrees with that predicted by deutsch and candelas @xcite for local boundary conditions , in accordance with the local nature of the mit bag boundary conditions .",
    "however , for spectral boundary conditions , the divergence is one order of magnitude more severe .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the analysis of @xcite , since the latter is not valid for the nonlocal spectral boundary conditions .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a massless quantum fermion field on minkowski space - time bounded by a cylinder of radius @xmath83 . in particular , we have defined vacuum and thermal states which are rigidly rotating with angular speed @xmath7 about the @xmath6-axis .",
    "we focused on the case @xmath84 , for which the boundary is inside or on the speed of light surface .",
    "the rotating vacuum is then identical to the nonrotating vacuum and thermal expectation values are finite everywhere inside and on the boundary .",
    "we considered two boundary conditions for the fermion field on the cylinder , namely the spectral and mit bag boundary conditions .",
    "the mit bag boundary conditions are local in nature , but the spectral boundary conditions are nonlocal as they are derived from a fourier transform of the fermion field .",
    "this difference between the boundary conditions is manifest both in different behaviour of the thermal expectation values as the boundary is approached , and in the rate of divergence of casimir expectation values .",
