    "atomic force spectroscopy based single molecule force spectroscopy technique ( afm - smfs ) ( described in detail elsewhere@xcite ) allows calibrated mechanical stretching and monitoring of individual polymer molecules such as sugars , dna or proteins . for a decade this tool has been used for the study of the folding and unfolding mechanism of proteins at the single molecule level and lately it has emerged as the means to test chemical catalysis at the level of a localized single disulfide bond  @xcite . in order to obtain a suitable ` fingerprint ' _ i.e. _ unambiguous independent evidence of the controlled condition of the intended sample ,",
    "protein samples are often engineered to contain multiple well separated identical repeats of the structure of interest  @xcite .",
    "the mechanics of these poly - proteins is expected to be identical to monomers but data from poly - proteins is considered to be less likely to be perturbed by spurious surface interactions  @xcite .",
    "its has been observed experimentally that for a poly - protein designed to contain @xmath0 identical modules , the number of observed modules is prevailingly smaller than @xmath0 , but to our knowledge there hasnt been a thorough analytical explanation for this phenomena .",
    "the following analysis explain the experimentally observed distribution of events by considering the stochastic nature of three relevant processes that define the experiment : the bonding of the sample , the unfolding event and the spontaneous ( or programmed ) termination of the experiment .",
    "the analysis is valid in a broad scope and the experimental data is provided as an representative example .",
    ", each one corresponding to the unfolding of a protein module .",
    "the experiment is interrupted shortly after 1 second , so any further events are ` censored'.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we study single poly - protein chains engineered to contain exactly @xmath1 identical domains of the protein ubiquitin ( ubi12 ) , stretched by afm at a constant force of @xmath2  pn  @xcite .",
    "the stretching force weakens the tertiary structure of all  protein modules \" exposed to force allowing them to unfold , yet the number of such observed unfolding events varies from case to case and rarely reached the total of 12 engineered modules .",
    "figure  1 shows an example of the raw data obtained by afm - smfs in constant - force mode , featuring only @xmath3 unfolding events at times @xmath4 , in an experiment that lasted around @xmath5 second . shows the population distribution of the number of observed unfolding events in each single poly - protein chain for an unfiltered data set consisting of @xmath6 unfolding poly - protein chains and a total of @xmath7 unfolding events .",
    "the number of traces observed to unfold @xmath8 events seems to decrease approximately by @xmath9 for each increment in @xmath8 .    , implying that the population of observed events decreases by @xmath9 for each extra observed unfolding module.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    here we explain this observed distribution with a simple approach that does not require assuming a particular model for the unfolding kinetics and relies only on the assumptions that the unfolding events are independent and identically distributed .",
    "we assume a chain of @xmath0 identical modules and define @xmath11 when the stretching force is first applied .",
    "the unfolding events occur between time @xmath12 and @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 .",
    "the experiment is interrupted stochastically by spontaneous detachment of the sample with probability density @xmath15 or by design at a known time .",
    "the experimental measurables are the observed unfolding times @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and the censoring time @xmath18 that is the event of the experiment been interrupted at time @xmath19 .",
    "any possible subsequent event after @xmath18 is not measurable , constituting a _ type 2 right censored _",
    "system@xcite .",
    "now we obtain the analytical expression of the probability for a @xmath10 order statistics@xcite to be the last one observed before time @xmath13 . the probability of a series of @xmath20 modules to unfold before the time @xmath13 is @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath20 modules can be chosen in @xmath22 different ways .",
    "for the @xmath10 to be the last event , no other events should happen after the interruption of the experiment .",
    "then the probability that _ any _ @xmath20 modules unfolded before @xmath13 and the remaining @xmath23 did not , is given by :    @xmath24    now we consider that the experiment is interrupted between time @xmath13 and @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 , now the probability that the @xmath10 is the last observed event at any time is    @xmath27    if algebraic expressions for @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath14 are available , equation  1 could be integrated analytically .",
    "for example , a trivial case of practical interest is the idealized arrhenius kinetics when the unfolding rate is a single exponential @xmath28 and experiment is only interrupted by design at time @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . by making @xmath31",
    "we see that the probability of observing the last event out of @xmath0 is :    @xmath32    solving for @xmath29 allows the design of an experimental protocol that extends in time enough to observe a desired proportion of the last event  @xcite .",
    "another example of interest is the case where the experiment is interrupted by the spontaneous detachment of the sample from the substrate or the cantilever tip .",
    "if we assume @xmath33 in equation  1 we obtain    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is euler s gamma function .",
    "we choose to avoid any model assumptions and integrate equation  [ eq : pkmaxgn ] numerically by estimating @xmath15 and @xmath14 directly from the raw experimental data .",
    "we assume the experimental data has been analyzed and compiled in @xmath36 sets containing the unfolding event times @xmath37 and the censoring times @xmath38 .",
    "all the events times and censoring times are respectively aggregated to estimate the their probability functions .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is calculated directly by an interpolating formula .    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the rank of the sample @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 $ ] , and @xmath43 is such that @xmath44 .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) is calculated by a gaussian kernel density estimation  @xcite .",
    "both cdf and pdf calculations are already implemented in a simple to use function _ smoothkerneldistribution _ in wolfram s mathematica  @xcite .",
    "+    the probability @xmath45 is calculated numerically by integrating equation  [ eq : pkmaxgn ] using the estimated @xmath14 from equation  [ eq : cpfinterp ] .",
    "the calculated values are given in table  1 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 in table 1 are arranged in a matrix @xmath47 for algebraic convenience .",
    "a consequence of censoring is that observing @xmath8 events is possible from from traces with any value of @xmath0 in the range @xmath48 .",
    "consequently the overall probability of observing @xmath8 events @xmath49 is given by    @xmath50    we new define the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 such that their components are the probabilities @xmath49 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "@xmath54    using this definition equation  [ eq : pkmax ] can be written more conveniently in matrix form    @xmath55    matrix @xmath47 allows us to transform the probability ( or population ) distributions from the available modules @xmath0 to the observed modules @xmath8 , and _",
    "vice versa_. now we investigate the expected population of observed number of events per chain for three different significant scenarios represented in figures  3a , 3c and 3e .    1 .   all poly - protein chain are deterministically picked from the end linkers , exposing all 12 modules to force .",
    "@xmath56 ( figure  3a ) 2 .",
    "one of the end linkers is fixed to the substrate and the cantilever picks randomly the chain at any linker , exposing between one and @xmath57 modules with equal probability .",
    "@xmath58 ( figure  3c ) 3 .",
    "both ends are picked randomly .",
    "there are @xmath59 ways to pick @xmath0 modules , making a total of @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 ( figure  3e )     ( left ) or observing @xmath20 ( right ) protein modules under three different scenarios .",
    "protein grabbed from a , b ) the ends ( always ) , c , d ) one end fixed and one random position , e , f ) two random places in the chain , title=\"fig : \" ] +    the calculated probability of observing @xmath8 modules is shown in figures  3b , 3d and 3e .",
    "we can notice that figure  3e looks remarkably similar to the histogram of experimentally observed @xmath8 in figure  2 , except for the first two bins corresponding to @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the small number of counts in the first two bins of figure  2 is explained by the fact that traces with less than two events are rarely saved because of the lack of a characteristic fingerprint to differentiate them from non specific sample .",
    "+    now we calculate @xmath64 , the inverse of @xmath47 to solve the inverse problem and estimate the population distribution of @xmath0 based on the population of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath65    in order to compensate for the censored data in the first two bins of figure  2 , we extrapolate the count values for @xmath62 and @xmath63 to match the observed trend using an exponential fit would contain negative values . ] .",
    "the corrected histogram is plotted with red bars in figure  4a . for comparison in the same figure",
    "the blue bars indicate the distribution expected when both ends of the poly - protein are picked randomly ( scenario 3 ) .",
    "the calculated population of @xmath0 is shown in figure  4b in red bars , together with the distribution expected when both ends of the poly - protein are picked randomly in blue bars .",
    "figures  4a and  4b confirms the similarity of the experimental data and the expected distribution for random binding of the poly - protein .    from this result",
    ", we can conclude that proteins are anchored in a completely random process , both to the substrate and to the cantilever . even if any anchor position is equally probable",
    ", the fact that there is only one way to pick all @xmath57 modules but several more more ways to pick a smaller number of modules explains the experiential distribution @xmath52 of the number @xmath0 of stretched modules .",
    "the population of observed events @xmath51 is further reduced by censoring .",
    "the procedure shown is a quantification of the probability of censoring data and allows to transform the observed population of events into the existing population based on a matrix constructed numerically based on experimental data and free of any assumptions on the kinetics of the events .",
    "the calculated existing population is consistent with the scenario where both anchoring points are chosen among all the protein modules with equal probability and the probability of picking @xmath0 modules is @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the less likely configuration is to have a protein grabbed from the ends , and the most likely is to grab a single module . in presence of spontaneous detachment of the sample or any other limitation on the experiment duration ,",
    "the observed distribution is further skewed by censoring last events making the observation of the unfolding of all engineered modules relatively unlikely .    in the presented experimental",
    "the protein sample was attached non - specifically to the substrate and afm cantilever tip and we concluded that the stretching ends were picked randomly .",
    "that scenario may not be the one present on experiments performed with specific functionalization at the protein ends .",
    "specific treatment of substrate and cantilever surfaces may be desirable to allow grabbing polymer samples form the ends or at least reduce spontaneous detachment of the sample and consequently minimize censoring .    the importance of addressing censoring in order to obtain unbiased estimators has been previously addressed for different single - molecules experiments  @xcite . the use of non - parametric estimators such as maximum likelihood  @xcite that addresses all the de details of the detection process is of paramount importance .",
    "ignoring that a finite experiment duration inevitably leads to censoring has lead cao _",
    "_ to mistakenly conclude that , under experimental conditions , the observed unfolding dwell times does not depend on the number @xmath0 of available modules  @xcite .",
    "we have identified the study of poly - proteins by afm - smfs as a type-2 right censored system and provided a model - independent method to understand and predict the population of observed unfolding events .",
    "the population of modules exposed to force is accurately estimated based in the number of observed events accounting for the unavoidable censoring of the data . using this method we concluded that the experimental data on afm - smfs unfolding of ubi12 stretched at constant @xmath2 pn clearly suggest that the attachment of the protein sample to the substrate and pulling probe is random and therefor observing the unfolding of all possible modules",
    "is highly unlikely .",
    "we are confident that the tools here developed will also be of use to the experimentalist in the process of designing protocols that account for the often ignored stochastic nature of the attachment and detachment of the sample to substrate and probe .",
