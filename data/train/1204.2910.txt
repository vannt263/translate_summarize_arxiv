    "vertex tracking is one of the capabilities most crucial to a detector at future lepton colliders and flavour factories .",
    "much of the anticipated physics program at a high energy lepton collider , such as the ilc , clic or a muon collider relies on the ability of efficiently discriminating heavy ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 ) from light fermions  @xcite .",
    "if the higgs boson exists at a mass of @xmath5 125  gev , as possibly indicated by the recent preliminary lhc  @xcite and tevatron  @xcite results , the precise determination of its couplings to fermions will be essential to test whether the brout - englert - higgs mechanism of electro - weak symmetry breaking is also responsible for fermion mass generation .",
    "experiments at lower energy facilities , such as the super kekb  @xcite and superb  @xcite @xmath3-factories , require high resolution vertex tracking for time - dependent measurements , which are crucial to the physics program in heavy flavour physics  @xcite . because the momentum of particles from @xmath6 meson decays at the @xmath7(4s )",
    "is low and the sensitivity to short - lived hadrons produced at high energy colliders must extend to most , if not all , of their charged decay products , excellent track extrapolation accuracy at low momentum is of paramount importance .",
    "this motivates the development of thin si sensors .",
    "monolithic pixel sensors , such as cmos active pixel sensors and depfet sensors , have emerged from the r&d effort for future @xmath8 colliders as the best suited solution for high - resolution vertex tracking with a minimal material budget in a low to moderate radiation environment  @xcite .",
    "more recently , monolithic pixel sensors on high resistivity substrate have demonstrated superior performance owing to the larger amount of charge collected , ensuring high detection efficiency , and the faster collection time , reducing also the effect of radiation damage  @xcite .    among the technologies offering a cmos process over a high resistivity sensitive volume , silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) , pioneered a decade ago  @xcite ,",
    "has been extensively tested in the last six years , within a collaborative r&d effort developed in partnership with kek and lapis semiconductor co. ltd .",
    "( formerly oki semiconductor ) . with the mitigation of the back - gating effect using a buried @xmath9-well ( bpw ) to protect the in - pixel cmos circuitry  @xcite ,",
    "soi pixel sensor prototypes have demonstrated high detection efficiency and single point resolution at the micron level  @xcite , also after thinning of the handle wafer  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate the vertex tracking performance of a hodoscope composed of soi pixel sensors based on the study of inelastic interaction of high energy pions in a beam test ( soipix ) at the cern sps in fall 2011 .",
    "we present the results obtained for tracking resolution , two - track separation and vertex resolution , compare our data to simulation and discuss the relation to requirements for future colliders .",
    "the soipix beam test experiment has been carried out on the sps beam - line h4 in the cern north area with a beam hodoscope made of three layers of `` soimager-2 '' prototype chips , designed at lbnl and produced in 0.2  @xmath10 m lapis technology ( formerly oki ) on @xmath11-type soi wafers with a resistivity of the handle wafer of @xmath5  700  @xmath12 cm .",
    "the sensor sensitive area is a 3.5@xmath133.5  mm@xmath14 matrix of 256@xmath13256 pixels arrayed on a 13.75  @xmath10 m pitch , read out through four parallel arrays of 64 columns each  @xcite .",
    "the sensor detection performances for high energy particles and soft x - rays have already been presented in details in  @xcite . in this setup , a single sensor ,",
    "thinned to 75  @xmath10 m ( singlet ) , is located upstream from a cu target to define the position of impact of the incoming pion .",
    "a pair of 260  @xmath10m - thick sensors spaced by 9.4  mm ( doublet ) reconstructs the trajectories of the charged particles emerging from the target .",
    "this spacing is comparable to that of the two layers of the pxd pixel detector in belle - ii and to the distance between the first and second layers of a lc vertex tracker .",
    "the 3  mm - thick cu target is inserted between the detector singlet and the doublet , 15  mm upstream from the first layer of the soi pixel doublet .",
    "the extrapolation distance from the first doublet layer and the target corresponds to the design distance between the interaction point and layer0 at superb and the first layer of the vertex tracker of an @xmath8 linear collider at @xmath15 = 250 - 500  gev , while for a multi - tev @xmath8 collider , such as clic , the beam induced background requires a stay - clear radius of @xmath1625 - 30  mm .",
    "the use of a thin sensor for the singlet minimises the interaction effects upstream from the target .",
    "data have been collected with @xmath0s of 150 and 300  gev/@xmath1 momentum",
    ". runs with 300  gev/@xmath1 pions have also been taken without the target , for alignment and calibration purposes .",
    "we operate the sensors at a depletion voltage , @xmath17 , of 50  v , corresponding to a depleted thickness of @xmath16100  @xmath10 m in the doublet sensors and @xmath1660  @xmath10 m in the thin singlet sensor .",
    "the data acquisition system consists of a custom analog board pigtailed to a commercial fpga development board , equipped with a xilinx virtex-5 fpga used as control board  @xcite .",
    "the sensor analog outputs are fed to 100  ms / s 14-bit adcs through independent analog differential inputs .",
    "digitised data are formatted and transferred to the daq computer via a usb-2.0 link at a rate of 25  mbytes / s .",
    "measurements are performed with the chip clocked at 12.5  mhz , corresponding to an 80  ns read - out time per pixel .",
    "the readout is synchronised with the sps extraction pulse , such that a sequence of 960 frames from each of the three sensors are read - out during the 9.6  s - long sps spill .",
    "detectors are cooled using forced airflow and the temperature near the sensor surface is in the range ( 28@xmath181)@xmath19c during data taking .",
    "data sparsification and zero suppression is performed on - line using a custom root - based  @xcite program .",
    "sensors are scanned for seed pixels with signal exceeding a preset threshold in noise units .",
    "for each seed , the 7@xmath137 pixel matrix centred around the seed position is selected and stored on file .",
    "the pixel pedestal and noise values are updated at the end of each sps spill , in order to follow possible drifts of their baselines throughout the data taking .",
    "data are stored in root format and subsequently converted into lcio format  @xcite for offline analysis .",
    "the data analysis is based on a set of custom processors in the marlin reconstruction framework  @xcite to perform cluster centre - of - gravity reconstruction , pattern recognition , track and vertex fitting  @xcite .",
    "clusters are reconstructed applying a double threshold method on the matrix of pixels around a selected candidate cluster seed .",
    "clusters are requested to have a seed pixel with a signal - to - noise ratio , s / n , of at least 7.0 and the neighbouring pixels with a s / n in excess of 5.0 .",
    "clusters consisting of a single pixel are discarded .",
    "the cluster position is computed using the centre of gravity of the measured pulse height .",
    "the observed average and most probable signal - to - noise ratio for clusters associated to reconstructed particle tracks in the pixel doublet is 47.4 and 43.0 .",
    "the most probable value of the signal - to - noise ratio for the seed pixel is 45.1 .",
    "this can be compared to 45.2@xmath180.4 predicted by sensor simulation  @xcite .",
    "the detector planes have been optically surveyed after installation on the beam - line .",
    "their measured positions are used as starting point for the offline alignment procedure with particle tracks , performed using the millipede-2 program  @xcite .",
    "a total of 201000 and 220000 events , having at least one hit per layer in the doublet and only one hit in the singlet , have been recorded in the september 2011 data taking with the target installed and 150 and 300  gev/@xmath1 beam , respectively .",
    "an additional @xmath1620000 calibration events have been collected without the target for alignment .",
    "simulation of interactions and energy release by charge particles in the detectors is performed using the geant-4 simulation toolkit  @xcite with the ftfp_bert physics list  @xcite , which implements high energy inelastic scattering of hadrons by nuclei using the fritiof model  @xcite .",
    "the yield of short- and long - lived particles has been studied using pythia 6.125  @xcite .",
    "charge collection and signal generation in the pixels is simulated using a custom marlin processor , pixelsim  @xcite , where the pixel s / n is tuned to the values obtained in data for each chip .",
    "simulated events are then analysed through the same reconstruction chain as real data .",
    "the efficiency of the soi sensors is determined by using particle tracks reconstructed on the other two layers and extrapolated to the layer under study , in the events taken without the target .",
    "the geant-4 + pixelsim simulation predicts a sensor efficiency of 0.998@xmath20 for the doublet .",
    "we estimated the efficiency of the sensors in the doublet in an earlier beam test performed in 2010 , when the same soi sensors were used both in for doublet and the singlet .",
    "we use the number of tracks reconstructed from hits on the second layer of the doublet and on the singlet which had an associated hit on the first layer of the doublet and found a value of 0.98@xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the single point resolution of the sensors is measured to be ( 1.12@xmath180.03 )  @xmath10 m for the doublet  @xcite and ( 1.7  @xmath180.50 )  @xmath10 m for the singlet  @xcite , where simulation predicts ( 1.07@xmath180.04 )  @xmath10 m and ( 1.63@xmath180.05 )  @xmath10 m , respectively .",
    "the difference is due to the lower amount of charge collected , and thus of signal - to - noise ratio , in the thin sensor .",
    "inelastic interaction events are reconstructed from tracks formed with the space points in the two doublet layers .",
    "we select events with only one reconstructed hit in the singlet layer and at least one accepted hit in each of the doublet layers to perform the track reconstruction .",
    "this pre - selection removes empty events and most of those with more than one primary pion recorded in the same frame .",
    "we reconstruct the trajectory of the incoming pion by projecting the position of the hit reconstructed in the thin singlet . since the r.m.s .",
    "divergence of the beam is 1.5@xmath1310@xmath22 rad in the vertical and 7.5@xmath1310@xmath22 rad in the horizontal coordinate , as measured in events taken without the target , the uncertainty on the vertical extrapolation of the pion position of impact on the target is @xmath53  @xmath10 m r.m.s .",
    "secondary candidate tracks are reconstructed in the doublet by pairing the hits .",
    "these are extrapolated to the singlet and their impact parameter w.r.t .",
    "the hit recorded on the singlet sensor computed .",
    "its distribution is peaked at the value of the extrapolation resolution for primary hadrons , which have not interacted in the target , while it has larger values for secondary particles produced in interactions in the target , as well as for primary pions experiencing large scattering , as shown in figure  [ fig : imp0 ] .",
    "we resolve the combinatorial in the pairing of the doublet hits by choosing the hit pair minimising the impact parameter , provided that the longitudinal position of the intercept of the corresponding track with the estimated primary hadron track is contained in the fiducial region between the singlet layer and the first doublet layer . in simulation , this strategy correctly assigns the hit pairing for 0.96 of the particle tracks emerging from an interaction and contained within the geometrical acceptance of the detector .",
    "after this first pass , a vertex is reconstructed for events with two or more tracks .",
    "then , candidate tracks are formed by pairing the unassociated hits in the doublet and tested for compatibility with the interaction vertex by computing their impact parameter w.r.t .",
    "its position .",
    "candidate tracks with impact parameter smaller than 40  @xmath10 m are kept .",
    "again , the combinatorial is solved by using the hit pair minimising this impact parameter .",
    "the interaction vertex for inelastic interaction events is reconstructed with the candidate tracks fitted in the doublet .",
    "several algorithms have been designed to reconstruct the interaction vertex from the trajectories of charged particles .",
    "they are typically implemented in the context of collider experiments with a homogeneous magnetic field using a helix track model . due to the geometry of the beam test setup and the lack of magnetic field , these implementations have numerical problems in reconstructing the interaction vertex for our experimental setup . in absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the track model is a simple straight line with four parameters .",
    "while the track model is simple , a specific implementation of the vertex fit procedure is required .",
    "due to the low multiplicity in the interaction events , the vertex position @xmath23 and the track parameters @xmath24 for particle @xmath25 can be simply derived from the minimisation of the sum of @xmath26 contributions of the trajectory to a global fit .",
    "the measurement of the trajectory for particle @xmath25 on detector @xmath27 at position @xmath28 is given by its cartesian coordinates @xmath29 and the corresponding reconstruction errors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath26 contribution of particle @xmath25 is then defined as    @xmath32    monte carlo simulation studies show that this approach avoids the numerical shortcomings of other implementations of vertex fits .",
    "the choice of an adequate track model is essential to reach high efficiency and accuracy in the fitting procedure . in this implementation",
    "a global fit has been used for simplicity , but the straight line track model could also be implemented in more complex vertex reconstruction programs .",
    "the vertex fit is performed iteratively .",
    "if the vertex @xmath33 probability is smaller than 10@xmath22 , the track giving the largest @xmath33 contribution is removed and the vertex recomputed .",
    "the hits used for reconstructing these tracks are not further used .",
    "a reconstructed event is shown in figure  [ fig : evt ] .",
    "using fully simulated and reconstructed events , we estimate the vertex reconstruction efficiency for inelastic interaction events with at least two charged particles within the detector acceptance to be 0.94@xmath180.05 .",
    "further , the reconstructed multiplicity of tracks associated to the vertex agrees with the generated charged multiplicity in the detector acceptance within @xmath180.04 .",
    "the number of candidate inelastic interaction events , reconstructed in data by the procedure discussed above , is 1105 and 2118 for 150 and 300  gev/@xmath1 pions , respectively , corresponding to 0.0055@xmath180.0002 and 0.0096@xmath180.0006 of the events preselected .",
    "the observed fractions agree quite well with simulation , which predicts 0.0065@xmath180.0003 and 0.0101@xmath180.0003 , confirming the efficiency indicated by simulation .",
    "for the subsequent analysis we apply additional quality cuts on the reconstructed events requiring the vertex fit @xmath33 probability to exceed 10@xmath22 and the uncertainty on the vertex longitudinal position to be smaller than 1.5  mm .",
    "this yields a total of 1048 selected interaction events at 150  gev/@xmath1 and 1862 at 300  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the track extrapolation accuracy at the position of the cu target , located 15  mm upstream from the first layer of the soi pixel doublet is 3.7  @xmath10 m for 300  gev/@xmath1 and 8.9  @xmath10 m for 1  gev/@xmath1 particles according to simulation , as shown in figure  [ fig : imp ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the measured multiplicity scales logarithmically with the beam energy , as expected  @xcite .",
    "we compare the multiplicity measured in our data as a function of @xmath34 to a fit to published data scaled to the rapidity range covered by our detector .",
    "following  @xcite , we use a function of the form @xmath35 = @xmath36 + @xmath3 ln(@xmath34/@xmath37 ) , where the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath3 are fitted on results reported for @xmath38  cu collisions at beam energies from 50 to 200  gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we get @xmath36=2.32 , @xmath3=0.84 for @xmath37=392  gev@xmath14 .",
    "our results agree with this curve , as shown in figure  [ fig : mults ] .",
    "the resolution on the vertex position reconstruction in the plane transverse to the beam is obtained by comparing the reconstructed vertex position to that of the incoming pion detected in the thin sensor upstream from the target .",
    "we measure a gaussian width of ( 8.9@xmath180.2 )  @xmath10 m . by subtracting in quadrature the incident pion extrapolation resolution of 3  @xmath10 m ( see section 2.1 ) , we obtain ( 8.4@xmath180.2 )  @xmath10 m , which accounts for the vertex resolution , the multiple scattering of the incident pion in the target before the interaction and that of the emerging interaction products .",
    "the estimated average uncertainty from the vertex fit error is 6.2  @xmath10 m and the difference between the generated and reconstructed position on simulated events has a gaussian width of 6.5  @xmath10 m .",
    "the resolution on the longitudinal vertex position is extracted first from the distribution of the longitudinal position of the vertex reconstructed in data and simulation , shown in figure  [ fig : vtxz ] .",
    "since the target has sharp edges , in absence of resolution effects this distribution is a box function .",
    "resolution effects introduce a smearing of the box edges , which can be observed in both data and the simulated and reconstructed interaction events .",
    "these vary depending on the momentum and multiplicity of the detected particles emerging from the interaction and on the longitudinal position of the interaction in the target .",
    "we perform a multi - parameter @xmath33 fit to the distribution of the reconstructed vertex longitudinal position . as a consistency test",
    ", we obtain a measurement of the target thickness of ( 3.15@xmath180.10 )  mm in data and ( 3.07@xmath180.05 )  mm in simulation , where a 3.00  mm thickness was generated .",
    "the average longitudinal vertex position resolution from the fit at 300  gev/@xmath1 is ( 503@xmath1860 )  @xmath10 m and ( 532@xmath1839 )  @xmath10 m , again in data and simulation respectively .",
    "it becomes ( 615@xmath1883 )  @xmath10 m and ( 590@xmath1835 )  @xmath10 m for data and simulation , respectively , at 150  gev/@xmath1 where the multiplicity is lower and the multiple scattering is more important .",
    "we observe that the distribution of the vertex position away from the target is asymmetric , as we reconstruct more vertices downstream from the target than upstream .",
    "since resolution and pattern recognition failures should give spurious vertices on either sides of the target position with equal probability , we interpret this as due to secondary vertices of long - lived particles produced in the primary interaction and decaying away from the target .",
    "simulation shows a similar effect , mostly due to @xmath39 decays , at a comparable rate as in our data .    in data ,",
    "the vertex fit error gives a most probable value of ( 335@xmath187 )  @xmath10 m and an average value of ( 490@xmath186 )  @xmath10 m , for the longitudinal vertex position resolution at 300  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the difference in the position of the generated and reconstructed vertices in simulated events has a gaussian width of ( 290@xmath1810 )  @xmath10 m and non - gaussian tails extending further , with the contribution of multiple scattering in the target to the gaussian resolution estimated to be 60  @xmath10 m , at 300  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "given the small angular coverage of our hodoscope and the large boost of the interaction products , the resolution on the longitudinal vertex position is driven by the small opening angle of the detected interaction products . in 500  gev @xmath8 collisions , simulated vertices from @xmath6 mesons with energies in the range 100 - 150  gev ,",
    "re - weighted by the associated track multiplicity to match that of the reconstructed vertices in our data , give a resolution of ( 170@xmath1820 )  @xmath10 m along the heavy meson line of flight  @xcite . on the other hand , at a multi - tev collider the typical resolution for high energy jets is larger by a factor of two .",
    "decay vertices in @xmath40 events at @xmath15 = 3 tev , where the @xmath6 mesons have energies in the range 200 - 700  gev , have been reconstructed using the zvtop topological vertex algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed secondary decay vertex has an average charged multiplicity of 2.36 and the most probable and average values of the vertex position resolution along the jet axis are ( 330@xmath185 )  @xmath10 m and ( 530@xmath183 )  @xmath10 m , respectively .",
    "these values are very close to those obtained in the present study .",
    "tracking and vertexing performance of a small beam hodoscope made of soi pixel sensors have been determined in a beam test with 150 and 300  gev/@xmath1 @xmath0s at the cern sps .",
    "the charged multiplicity of inelastic @xmath38-cu interactions has been determined to be 2.16@xmath180.18 at 150  gev/@xmath1 and 2.57@xmath180.22 at 300  gev/@xmath1 , which agrees with earlier data and logarithmic scaling with the beam energy .",
    "the two - track separation of the sensor is @xmath550  @xmath10 m , i.e.  four pixels , which agrees with the observed pixel multiplicity along columns and rows in reconstructed clusters .",
    "merged hits can be identified by the large collected charge in the cluster .",
    "the vertex resolution is estimated to be 8.4  @xmath10 m transverse and @xmath5350 - 500  @xmath10 m longitudinal .",
    "the results obtained are representative of the experimental conditions and reconstruction performance expected in highly boosted hadronic jets at tev - class lepton colliders and demonstrate that pixels sensors with @xmath1615  @xmath10 m pitch on high - resistivity si are extremely well suited for these applications .",
