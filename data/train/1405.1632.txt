    "the topological protection of these surface states is lost , but they evolve _ continuously _ as a function of the deformation . thus the surface bands become dispersive and generally move away from the fermi energy but are not destroyed until they merge with the continuum of bulk bands.@xcite the same type of argument can explain the edge states at graphene zigzag edges , which form nearly but not quite flat bands.@xcite since we are using two - dimensional models , the surface states of slabs emerge as edge states of strips . using two - dimensional models",

    "our results for strips with ( 10 ) edges in the paramagnetic and in the antiferromagnetic phase , obtained in ref .  , are briefly summarized in the following . in the two - orbital model , four bands of edge states",

    "the asymptotically degenerate bundles of bands split due to the coupling of the spin of the electrons localized at the surface to the sdw order parameter , which is uniform along the ( 10 ) edges .",
    "however , they remain exactly degenerate in pairs since the corresponding mean - field hamiltonian is still invariant under combined spin rotation by @xmath69 about the @xmath9 axis and spatial reflection @xmath70 .    for the antiferromagnetic phase with ordering vector @xmath71 , the ( 01 ) edge",
    "is not equivalent to the ( 10 ) edge .",
    "for the ( 01 ) edge , the magnetic unit cell is doubled in the @xmath9 direction and thus the one - dimensional ( 1d ) edge bz is halved . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of surface bands doubles , due to the folding of the spectrum , and the resulting degeneracy at the boundaries of the magnetic bz is lifted by the sdw . unlike for the ( 10 ) edge",
    ", the original four - fold degeneracy of the surface bands for @xmath72 remains intact ( not shown ) .",
    "this is because the magnetization at the ( 01 ) edges is staggered so that states of opposite spin localized at the same edge are not split .",
    "these observations hold for both models .",

    "large values of the gap @xmath55 have been considered to more clearly exhibit the effects of interest .",
    "the spectra show the typical doubling and particle - hole symmetry induced by the bdg description .    in the case of @xmath40-wave pairing ,",
    "a full gap opens without any edge states inside the gap .",
    "the bulk states are pushed out of the gap according to @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , the surface bands are modified in the same way , as emphasized by the dashed green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2_orb_bands_sc_10](a ) .",
    "we can understand this by noting that the @xmath40-wave pairing interaction is purely local and is therefore not affected by the introduction of edges .",
    "hence , one would indeed expect @xmath40-wave pairing to induce similar gaps for bulk and surface states . in this process ,",
    "the edge bands from the normal state ( dashed green lines ) become resonant with bulk states , which destroys their localization at the edges",
    ". moreover , there are no andreev bound states .",
    "this is expected since for andreev bound states to appear andreev reflection involving gaps of opposite sign has to be possible.@xcite    let us now discuss the realistic case of @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",

    "[ fig:2_orb_bands_sc_10](b)(d ) show that the bulk gap is no longer constant in the bz . moreover , there are states inside the bulk gap .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath40-wave case , the topological surface bands from the normal state are not pushed away .",
    "in fact , they coincide closely with the normal - state bands and their charge conjugates , as indicated by the dashed dark blue lines .",
    "although they are still mostly hidden in the bulk continuum in fig.[fig:2_orb_bands_sc_10](b ) , parts of them become visible within the gap . near zero energy , we observe a gap for the surface bands , which is much smaller than the bulk gap .",
    "furthermore , we find additional edge bands in ranges of @xmath56 without edge states in the normal phase , but connected to them .",
    "they merge with the bulk continuum at @xmath74 and @xmath75 . on the whole , there is a pair of surface bands for @xmath76 , doubled at @xmath77 . within the pairs ,",
    "we find bonding and anti - bonding states whose energy difference is exponentially small for large width .",
    "it is reasonable that @xmath0-wave and @xmath40-wave pairing differently affect the surface states resulting from the normal phase .",
    "the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction is not local but connects next - nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "thus , the interaction is cut off at the edges so that it affects edge states less strongly than bulk states .",
    "the additional surface bands can be explained as andreev bound states:@xcite the fermi surface of the normal state along with the sign structure of the gap function are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_scattering_10 ] .",
    "the edge is parallel to the @xmath10 axis and , hence , @xmath56 is a constant of motion during the scattering processes .",
    "therefore , we have to consider lines through the bz with constant @xmath56 in order to find the available states .",
    "furthermore , for small gap amplitudes @xmath55 , only states at the fermi surfaces are relevant . from fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_scattering_10](a ) , we see that sign - changing scattering processes are possible for all @xmath56 except where the line @xmath78 does not cross a fermi surface . but",
    "the latter is exactly the region where we have found topological surface states . in other words ,",
    "topological states are only possible if the @xmath78 line corresponds to a gapped system with _ no _ states available at the fermi energy , whereas andreev states require a gapless system where states at the fermi level _ do _ exist .",
    "hence , topological surface states inherited from the normal phase and andreev bound states coexist , but their @xmath56 ranges do not overlap in the limit of small @xmath55 .",
    "note that the bands of topological states and of andreev bound states are connected .",
    "this is easy to understand : as discussed above , the bands of topological surface states are less strongly affected by the nonlocal @xmath0-wave pairing . on the other hand",
    ", the bands must be continuous in @xmath56 and thus can not suddenly terminate .",
    "consequently , in the superconducting state additional states must appear in the gap that complete the bands of topological states .    for larger @xmath55 ,",
    "states from a broader range of @xmath79 values in the vicinity of the normal - state fermi surface are relevant for andreev scattering , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_scattering_10](b ) .",

    "moreover , in the @xmath56 range for topological surface states , the edge bands lose their resemblance to the normal state ( dashed dark blue lines ) .",

    "thus , scattering processes with a sign change of the gap function can occur , leading to the emergence of andreev bound states . in this case , the andreev states are of course not connected to topological states .     +    finally , we turn to the superconducting ( 11 ) strip in the five - orbital model . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5_orb_bands_paramagnetic_11 ] , we found two bundles of surface states in the normal phase . in the superconducting state , the upper bundle vanishes completely into the bulk continuum , whereas the lower bundle remains partly in a bulk gap .",
    "this is similar to the ( 10 ) system in the five - orbital model .",
    "however , the present case is particularly interesting since the normal - state edge bands cross the fermi energy .    for @xmath40-wave superconductivity , bulk and edge states",
    "are again gapped in the same way , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5_orb_bands_sc_11](a ) . for @xmath0-wave pairing",
    ", we observe that a larger part of the lower bundle of topological surface bands remains inside the gap , hardly affected by the superconducting pairing , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5_orb_bands_sc_11](b ) .",
    "however , a very small gap opens , which is much smaller than the bulk gap .",
    "this can again be attributed to the weakening of the nonlocal @xmath0-wave pairing interaction at the edge , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub:1001 ] .",
    "furthermore , we find additional surface bands near @xmath105 very close to the bulk continuum .",
    "these can be understood as andreev bound states as discussed for the two - orbital model .",
    "we note that the behavior of the surface bands for larger @xmath55 , is similar to the ( 10 ) strip .",
    "the surface band gap grows and the resemblance of the topological bands to the normal phase gets weaker ( not shown ) .",
    "in addition , the andreev bands separate more strongly from the bulk continuum .",
    "we have studied various strip geometries of iron pnictides with small - index edges in the paramagnetic , antiferromagnetic , and superconducting phases with regard to the possible existence of surface states . for this",
    ", we have used both a simple two - orbital model@xcite and a more realistic five - orbital model.@xcite    for the paramagnetic phase , we have found that the number of surface bands depends both on the strip geometry and the specific model considered .",
    "the ( 10 ) strip shows edge states in both models.@xcite the two - orbital model predicts one spin - degenerate band of edge states at each edge ( in the limit of large width ) , resulting from nontrivial winding in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 orbital space .",
    "the five - orbital model has additional nontrivial winding with regard to the @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals , which doubles the number of edge bands.@xcite the results for the ( 11 ) strip show that also the winding in the sector of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is different between the two models : the two - orbital model is topologically trivial and thus has no edge states , whereas the five - orbital model has two spin - degenerate edge bands at each ( 11 ) edge .",
    "this indicates that the two - orbital model is too simple to account for the full topological structure of the pnictide bands .",
    "the presence or absence of surface states can be explained by considering a continuous deformation of effective 1d hamiltonians into hamiltonians in symmetry class bdi.@xcite however , these states are no longer topologically protected and thus move away from the fermi energy when the deformation is reversed .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this type of argument is rather robust since it only relies on the existence of a continuous deformation that does not close a gap .",
    "therefore , the qualitative results , in particular the existence of surface states , would not change if we included ( i ) changes in the model parameters close to the surface , describing possible reconstruction and relaxation , ( ii ) order parameters @xmath36 and @xmath55 calculated self - consistently for the strip geometry , or ( iii ) weak coupling in the third dimension .    in the antiferromagnetic phase",
    ", the degeneracy of the surface bands in the limit of large width is strongly lifted if the presence of the sdw leads to a net spin polarization of the edges , which for @xmath71 order is the case for @xmath106 edges but not for @xmath107 or @xmath108 edges .",
    "nevertheless , the remaining two - fold degeneracy is protected by a combination of spin rotation and spatial reflection .    in the superconducting phase with @xmath0-wave gap structure ,",
    "the topological surface states are less strongly affected by the superconducting pairing than the bulk states .",
    "only a small gap opens in the surface bands so that they are almost identical to the normal state and partially remain inside the gap .",
    "in addition , andreev bound states appear for certain edges , which can be understood from the changing gap sign for andreev reflection.@xcite for small gaps , the andreev bound states coexist with the topological states in different ranges of the momentum component parallel to the edge . for larger  and for pnictides unphysical  gap values , the andreev bound states and topological surface bands merge and lose their individual character .",
    "the edges studied here correspond to ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 010 ) surfaces in the real three - dimensional system . however , these surfaces are challenging to prepare since the natural cleavage plane is ( 001 ) .",
    "more promising is the examination of single - unit - cell steps on pnictide ( 001 ) surfaces , which are indeed occasionally seen in scanning - tunneling - microscopy experiments.@xcite since the coupling between layers in 1111 pnictides is weak , it would only weakly perturb the bound states at the edge of the incomplete layer . hence",
    ", it should be possible to detect bound states at step edges with scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "for the detection of bound states in the superconducting phase , it might be possible to perform tunneling experiments on normal - superconducting interfaces at the edges of a ( 001 ) pnictide sample .    on a more general level",
    ", our results emphasize that topological signatures , such as surface states , can occur in materials that are not topological in the sense of the topological classification of gapped systems.@xcite iron pnictides and graphene are examples of gapless materials that have topological properties . in the pnictides ,",
    "the topologically nontrivial properties come from the multi - orbital character of the band structure close to the fermi energy .",
    "it is promising to search for other materials with topological features related to their multi - orbital structure .",
