    "the galaxy merger rate over cosmic time is one of the fundamental measures of the evolution of galaxies .",
    "galaxies and the dark matter halos they live in must grow with time through mergers with other galaxies and through the accretion of gas and dark matter from the cosmic web . over the past 10 billion years",
    ", the global star - formation rate density has declined by a factor of 10 ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; hopkins & beacom 2006 ) while the global stellar - mass density has increased by a factor of two ( e.g. rudnick et al . 2003 ; dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ) . at the same time , massive galaxies have been transformed from rapidly star - forming disk galaxies into quiescent bulge - dominated galaxies hosting super - massive black holes ( e.g. bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "2007 ; brown et al . 2007 ) .",
    "galaxy mergers may be an important process that drives galaxy assembly , rapid star - formation at early times , the accretion of gas onto central super - massive black holes , and the formation of dispersion - dominated spheroids ( e.g. toomre 1977 ; white & rees 1978 ; kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ; somerville et al .",
    "2001 , 2008 ; di matteo et al . 2008 ; hopkins et al . 2006 , 2008 ) . because other physical processes are also at work , direct observations of the galaxy mergers are needed to understand their global importance to galaxy evolution and assembly .    in a cold - dark matter dominated universe ,",
    "massive structures are expected to grow hierarchically .",
    "numerical simulations consistently predict that the dark matter halo - halo merger rate per progenitor ( or descendant ) halo at fixed halo mass changes rapidly with redshift @xmath9 ( e.g. gottlber , klypin , & kratsvov 2001 ; fakhouri & ma 2008 ; genel et al .",
    "2009 ; fakhouri , ma , & boylan - kolchin 2010 ) . the dark matter merger rate scales with mass and mass ratio ( fakhouri & ma 2008 ; fakhouri et al .",
    "more massive halos are rarer , but have more frequent merger rates per halo .",
    "minor mergers with mass ratios greater than 1:4 should be much more common per halo than major mergers with comparable mass halos .",
    "however , the theoretical predictions for the _ galaxy _ merger rate remain highly uncertain ( e.g. jogee et al . 2009 ; see hopkins et al .",
    "2010a for a review )",
    ". the predicted @xmath10 evolution in the dark - matter halo merger rate ( per halo above a fixed total mass ) does not automatically translate into a @xmath10 evolution in the galaxy merger rate ( per galaxy above a fixed stellar mass ) because there is not a simple connection between observed galaxies and dark matter halos ( e.g. berrier et al .",
    "2006 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2010a , moster et al . 2010 ) .",
    "for example , the differences in the dark matter halo mass function and the galaxy stellar mass function at the high mass and low mass ends naturally produces a discrepancy between the merger rates as a function of stellar and dark - matter mass and mass ratio .",
    "many galaxy evolution models predict that the evolution of major mergers of galaxies selected above a fixed stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) changes more modestly with redshift ( @xmath12 ) , but these can have an order of magnitude variation in their normalizations ( e.g. jogee et al .",
    "2009 ; hopkins et al .",
    "the largest source of theoretical uncertainty for semi - analytic galaxy evolution models is the baryonic physics required to map galaxies onto dark matter halos and sub - halos , and in turn , required to match the observational selection of luminous merging galaxies ( hopkins et al .",
    "2010a and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , semi - empirical models which map galaxies onto dark matter sub - halos by matching the observed abundances of galaxies ( per unit luminosity ) to the abundances of sub - halos ( per unit mass ) give reasonably good predictions for clustering statistics by adopting fairly small dispersions in the mapping function ( e.g. zheng et al .",
    "2007 , conroy & wechsler 2009 ) and give a only factor of two discrepancy in the predicted major merger rates ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2010b , stewart et al .",
    "2009a ) .",
    "despite more than a decade of work , measurements of the observed galaxy merger rate and its evolution with redshift has not converged .",
    "current observations of the fraction of bright / massive galaxies undergoing a merger differ by an order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and estimates of the evolution in this merger fraction of at @xmath13 vary from weak or no evolution ( e.g. bundy et al . 2004",
    "; lin et al 2004 ; lotz et al .",
    "2008a ; jogee et al .",
    "2009 ; bundy et al . 2009",

    "it has been difficult to understand the source of these discrepancies , as the various studies often employ different criteria for counting galaxy mergers and different selections for the parent galaxy samples .",
    "these observational studies identify galaxy merger candidates either as galaxies in close pairs ( in projected or real 3-d space ) or galaxies with distorted morphologies ( measured quantitatively or by visual inspection ) . a key obstacle to the consistent measurement of the galaxy merger rate",
    "has been the poorly constrained timescales for detecting galaxy mergers selected by different methods .",
    "close pairs find galaxies before they merge , while merger - induced morphological disturbances can appear before , during , and after a galaxy merger .",
    "moreover , morphological studies use a variety of tracers to classify galaxies as mergers ( such as @xmath1 , asymmetry , tidal tails ) , which have differing sensitivities to different merger properties such as mass ratio and gas fraction .",
    "thanks to new high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers which model realistic light profiles including the effects of star - formation and dust ( e.g. jonsson et al 2006 ) , it is now possible to estimate the timescales for detecting galaxy mergers with a variety of close pair and morphological criteria ( lotz et al . 2008b ; lotz et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",
    "these simulations also span a range of merger properties , including progenitor mass , mass ratio , gas fraction , and orbital parameters ( cox et al . 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "mass ratio and gas fraction are especially important for interpreting the merger fractions derived from morphological studies ( lotz et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to self - consistently determine the observational galaxy merger rate at @xmath3 from recent close pair and morphological studies .",
    "we weight the merger timescales from individual high - resolution simulations by the expected distribution of merger properties ( including gas fraction and mass ratio ) to determine the average observability timescale as a function of redshift for each method for finding galaxy mergers ( close pairs , @xmath1 , asymmetry ) .",
    "these new calculations of the average observability timescales are crucial for interpreting the observed galaxy merger fractions .",
    "we re - analyze the observations of galaxy mergers at @xmath3 from the recent literature and derive new estimates of the galaxy merger rate .",
    "we also carefully consider the effects of parent sample selection on the inferred evolution of the galaxy merger rate .",
    "we conclude that the differences in the observed galaxy merger fractions may be accounted for by the different observability timescales , different mass - ratio sensitivities , and different parent galaxy selections .",
    "when these differences in the methodology are properly accounted for by adopting our derived timescales , we are able to derive self - consistent estimates of the major and minor galaxy merger rate and its evolution .    in  2",
    ", we define the volume - averaged galaxy merger rate , @xmath15 , as the co - moving number density of on - going galaxy merger events per unit time , and the fractional galaxy merger rate , @xmath16 , as the number of galaxy merger events per unit time per selected galaxy .",
    "we discuss how to calculate @xmath15 and @xmath16 using close pairs and disturbed morphologies . in  3 , we review the recent literature estimates of the galaxy merger fraction using quantitative morphology ( @xmath1 , asymmetry ) and close pairs of galaxies and discuss the importance of the parent sample selection . in ",
    "4 , we review the results from the individual high - resolution galaxy merger simulations .",
    "we present new calculations of the cosmologically - averaged merger observability timescale @xmath0 for close pairs , @xmath1 , and asymmetry , using the distribution of galaxy merger properties predicted by three different galaxy evolution models ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ; somerville et al . 2008",
    "; stewart et al .",
    "2009b ) . in  5",
    ", we derive the fractional and volume - averaged major and minor galaxy merger rates for galaxy samples selected by stellar - mass , evolving luminosity , and constant co - moving number density at @xmath3 .",
    "we compare these results to the predicted major and minor galaxy merger rates . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , except for close pair projected separations where @xmath21 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 .",
    "the volume - averaged galaxy merger rate @xmath15 is defined as the number of on - going merger events per unit co - moving volume , @xmath22 , divided by the time @xmath23 for the merger to occur from the initial encounter to the final coalescence : @xmath24 note that @xmath23 , the time period between the time of the initial gravitational encounter and coalescence ( from `` not merging '' to `` merged '' ) is not well defined .",
    "more accurately , the number density of galaxies identified as galaxy mergers @xmath22 will depend on the average timescale @xmath25 during which the merger can be observed given the method used to identify it , such that @xmath26 a galaxy merger may be identified at discontinuous stages ( as in the case of close pairs ) , therefore @xmath27 is the sum of the observability windows .",
    "thus , the galaxy merger rate @xmath28 can be calculated from the observed number density of galaxy merger candidates @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30    the majority of past merger calculations have assumed @xmath25 to be a constant value ranging from @xmath31 0.2 gyr to 1 gyr , without considering the differences in methodology , the effect of merger parameters , or redshift - dependent changes in the ability to detect mergers . in  4 , we present detailed calculations of @xmath25 as a function of redshift for different methods using theoretical models of galaxy interactions and the evolving distribution of galaxy merger properties .",
    "galaxy mergers can be directly identified as close galaxy pairs that have a high probability of merging within a short time .",
    "galaxies with similar masses that lie within a hundred kpc of each other and have relative velocities less than a few hundred km s@xmath20 are likely to merge within a few billion years .",
    "individual close galaxy pairs may be found by counting up the numbers of galaxies with companions within a given projected separation @xmath32 and within a relative velocity or redshift range . however , spectroscopic determination of the relative velocities of close pairs is observationally expensive , and prone to incompleteness due to slit / fiber collisions and biased detection of emission - line galaxies ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 ; de ravel et al .",
    "photometric redshifts are often used as a proxy for spectroscopic velocity separations ( e.g. kartaltepe et al .",
    "2007 , bundy et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , even high precision photometric redshifts ( @xmath33 ) are only accurate to 100 - 200 mpc along the line of sight .",
    "therefore significant statistical corrections for false pairs are required for photometrically selected pair studies ( e.g. kartaltepe et al .",
    "finally , two - point angular correlation studies of large samples of galaxies have also been used to determine the statistical excess of galaxies within a given dark matter halo ( e.g. masjedi et al .",
    "2006 , robaina et al .",
    "these studies are less prone to line - of - sight projection issues , but can not identify individual merging systems .",
    "morphological disturbances also indicate a recent or on - going merger .",
    "galaxy mergers experience strong gravitational tides , triggered star - formation , and the redistribution of their stars and gas into a single relaxed galaxy .",
    "this gravitational rearrangement results in morphological distortions ",
    "e.g. asymmetries , double nuclei , tidal tails  which are detectable in high - resolution images .",
    "such disturbances can be found through visual inspection by human classifiers , or by quantitative measurements of galaxy structures .",
    "several different quantitative methods are commonly used to measure galaxy morphology and classify galaxy mergers .",
    "rotational asymmetry ( @xmath2 ) picks out large - scale high surface brightness asymmetric structures",
    "( e.g. abraham et al . 1994 ; conselice , bershady , & jangren 2000 ; conselice 2003 ) ; the combination of the gini coefficient ( @xmath34 ; abraham et al .",
    "2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 ) and second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the light ( @xmath35 ) selects galaxies with multiple bright nuclei ( lotz et al .",
    "2004 ) . both of these methods require high signal - to - noise and high spatial resolution images generally only achievable with the hubble space telescope ( @xmath36 ) at @xmath37 , as well as a training set to distinguish ` normal ' galaxies from merger candidates .",
    "the merger fraction , @xmath38 , is the fraction of galaxies identified as mergers for a given galaxy sample , and is often presented instead of the number density of observed merger events .",
    "thus @xmath29 depends on both the merger fraction and the co - moving number density of galaxies in the selected sample , @xmath39 : @xmath40    for both morphologically - selected and close pair merger candidates , a correction factor is applied to the merger fraction to account for contamination from objects that are not mergers . for morphological merger selection",
    ", this correction is applied prior to calculating @xmath38 based on visual inspection or a statistical correction . for close pairs ,",
    "the fraction of pairs ( @xmath41 ) or the fraction of galaxies in a pair ( @xmath42 ) is multiplied by this correction factor @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 we will adopt @xmath45 throughout this paper .",
    "numerical simulations and empirical measurements suggest that @xmath43 is @xmath31 0.4@xmath461.0 for close pairs selected with projected separations",
    "@xmath47 20@xmath4630 kpc @xmath48 ( kitzbichler & white 2008 , patton & atfield 2008 ; see bundy et al .",
    "2009 for discussion ) .",
    "it is worth noting that close pair samples are likely to be biased towards objects in groups or clusters ( barton et al .",
    "2007 ) , although simulations suggest that the majority of these objects will merge ( kitzbichler & white 2008 ) .",
    "multiple authors have estimated the fractional merger rate @xmath16 instead of @xmath15 where @xmath49 ( e.g. lpez - sanjuan et al .",

    "2009 ) . in principle",
    ", the fractional merger rate @xmath16 circumvents variation in @xmath39 , which may change from field to field with cosmic variance and is a factor of two or more lower at @xmath50 than @xmath51 for fixed stellar mass or passive luminosity evolution selection ( figure 2 ) .",
    "semi - analytic cosmological simulations also have difficulty simultaneously reproducing the correct galaxy number densities at all mass scales , but may be more robustly compared to observations for relative trends such as @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath15 traces the number of merger events per co - moving volume above some mass / luminosity limit , while @xmath16 traces the number of merger events per ( bright / massive ) galaxy .",
    "it is often implicitly assumed that any evolution with redshift is not dependent on @xmath52 or the galaxy selection either because the parent galaxy samples are selected in a uniform way or because the merger rate is not a strong function of galaxy luminosity , mass , or number - density .",
    "however , several studies have found that the fraction of mergers increases significantly at fainter absolute magnitudes / lower stellar masses ( bridge et al .",
    "2010 ; de ravel et al . 2009",
    "; lin et al . 2004",
    "; bundy et al 2005 ) , while other studies have found increased merger fractions for more massive galaxies ( bundy et al .",
    "2009 ; conselice et al .",
    "if the observed merger fraction depends upon luminosity or stellar mass , comparison of different observational estimates of @xmath15 or @xmath16 will require careful consideration of the parent galaxy sample selection criteria .",
    "we will return to this issue in  3.5 .",
    "despite the large number of galaxy merger studies , there is little consensus on the galaxy merger rate or its evolution with redshift at @xmath3 . in part , this is because many studies have compared the galaxy merger fraction @xmath53 ( figure 1 ) or the galaxy merger rate for galaxy merger samples selected with different approaches and/or with different parent sample criteria . in this section ,",
    "we review the selection of galaxy mergers and their parent samples for a variety of recent merger studies at @xmath3 .",
    "we will focus on works that identify merger via quantitative morphology ( @xmath54 , @xmath2 ) or close pairs , but briefly discuss results from other approaches .",
    "almost all of these studies have calculated either the evolution in the merger fraction ( @xmath38 or @xmath41 ) , thereby ignoring @xmath0 , or the merger rate @xmath15 or @xmath16 by assuming a constant @xmath55 with redshift .",
    "one quantitative morphological approach to identifying galaxy mergers in high - resolution images has been the @xmath54 method .",

    "simulations of galaxy mergers revealed that the @xmath54 technique primarily identifies mergers during the first pass and final merger ( lotz et al .",

    ", we find little difference between the merger rates for luminosity and stellar - mass selected samples , implying that luminosity brightening does not introduce signification biases to the merger rate .    finally , it is also important to note that the standard selection of galaxy sample for galaxy merger studies ( e.g. above a fixed stellar mass ) is not well matched to the way that dark matter halos are selected from simulations for dark matter halo merger studies ( e.g. above a fixed halo mass ) .",

    "both observational and theoretical uncertainties make it difficult to calculate the merger rate reliably with asymmetric galaxies .",

    "( @xmath325 ) also selects a roughly constant and similar number density of galaxies ( black points ) . in order to compare the @xmath1 results to these studies , we adopt a fixed rest - frame @xmath63 luminosity cut of @xmath87(ab )",

    "the evolution in fractional merger rate @xmath332 is similar to the evolution in volume - averaged merger rate .",

    "we do incorporate the relative numbers of minor and major mergers into our timescale calculations , but in practice only the asymmetry timescales are strongly dependent on the assumed mass ratio distributions .",

    "( for completeness , we have also plotted the luminosity - selected close pairs as these give the same merger rate as the stellar - mass selected pairs ) .",
    "the evolution in the volume - averaged major merger rate @xmath15 is somewhat weaker and in better agreement with the data for the semi - empirical models ( st09 , h10 ) .",
    "this is likely because those models use @xmath52 as an input parameter rather than give independent predictions for @xmath52 as the s08 and c06 models do .",
    "the evolution in the fractional major merger rate @xmath16 is similar for all the models , and in excellent agreement with the data .    on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted total merger rates ( major+minor ) are significantly lower than what is observed for @xmath1 mergers . given the uncertainty in the lower mass ratio limit for @xmath1-selected mergers , we show both the 1:1 - 1:10 and 1:1 - 1:30 total merger rates .",
    "the 1:1 - 1:10 merger rates are a factor of  5 less than the @xmath1-derived merger rates , while the 1:1 - 1:30 merger rates are a factor @xmath31 2 - 3 lower .",
    "the evolutionary trends with redshift are similar to the major merger predictions , with weaker evolution in @xmath15 for the semi - empirical models that follows the same evolutionary trend as the data .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalization of the minor merger rates .",
    "the @xmath1 merger rates could be over - estimated , either because it suffers from large contamination of non - merging systems or because we have under - estimated @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , the models could under - estimate the frequency of minor mergers . a primary galaxy of stellar mass @xmath11 undergoing",
    "a 1:10 merger will have a merging satellite galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath338 ; a 1:30 merger will have a merging satellite will have a stellar mass of @xmath339 .",
    "the total halo masses are roughly 10 times higher , but are still approaching the numerical resolution of merger trees based on numerical simulations with typical particle masses @xmath340 ( e.g. st09 , c06 , h10 ) . also , low mass satellite galaxies are strongly effected by difficult - to - model physics , including supernova feedback and satellite disruption .",
    "therefore it is possible that the simulations have incompletely sampled the minor merger populations ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "both higher resolution models and improved estimates of the minor merger rates are needed to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "we attempt to reconcile the disparate observational estimates of the galaxy merger rate at @xmath3 , and calculate the fractional ( per galaxy ) and volume - averaged ( per co - moving volume ) galaxy merger rates for major ( 1:1 - 1:4 ) and minor ( 1:4 - 1:10 ) mergers .",
    "when physically - motivated cosmologically - averaged timescales , similar parent sample selections , and consistent definitions of the merger rate are adopted , we are able to derive self - consistent estimates of the major and minor galaxy merger rate and its evolution .",
    "we conclude that the differences in the observed galaxy merger fractions may accounted for by the different observability timescales , different mass - ratio sensitivities , and different parent galaxy selections .",
    "we compute the first cosmologically - averaged observability timescales for three different approaches to identifying mergers  close pairs , @xmath1 and asymmetry  using the results of a large suite of high - resolution n - body / hydrodynamical merger simulations and three different cosmological galaxy evolution models to predict the distribution of galaxy merger mass ratios and baryonic gas fractions .",
    "the timescales for close pairs and @xmath1 are relatively insensitive to the assumptions about the distribution of galaxy merger properties .",
    "however , the cosmologically - averaged asymmetry timescales vary by a factor of @xmath81 with different assumptions for the distribution and evolution of baryonic gas fractions .",
    "in particular , if the mean gas fraction of merging galaxies evolves as strongly as recent observations suggest , then the typical timescale for identifying a galaxy merger via asymmetry may increase by a factor of 2 from @xmath136 to @xmath135 .",
    "we apply these timescales to the close pair fraction and morphologically - determined merger fractions at @xmath3 published in the recent literature to compute merger rates .",
    "we estimate the minor merger rate by computing the difference between the close pair - derived and @xmath1-derived merger rates .",
    "\\(1 ) the evolution of the major and minor merger rates of galaxies depends upon the definition of merger rate ( fractional or volume - averaged ) and the selection of the parent sample of galaxies for which the merger rate is measured . for parent samples of fixed stellar mass or with an assumption of passive luminosity evolution ( ple ) , the evolution in the volume - averaged merger rate @xmath15 [ gyr@xmath20 mpc@xmath328 ] is significant weaker than the evolution in the fractional merger rate @xmath16 [ gyr@xmath20 ] .",
    "this is because the co - moving number density of galaxies with these selections declines by a factor of @xmath81 from @xmath136 to @xmath135 .",
    "\\(2 ) the fractional and volume - averaged major merger rates at @xmath13 for galaxies selected above a fixed stellar mass or assuming passive luminosity evolution are calculated for close pairs with stellar mass ratios or optical luminosity ratios between 1:1 and 1:4 ( tables 1 and 4 ) .",
    "the number of major mergers per bright / massive galaxies increases as @xmath343 with redshift , but the number of major mergers per co - moving volume ( selected above a constant stellar mass ) does not evolve significantly with redshift . the major merger rates for galaxies selected with @xmath336 and with @xmath344 agree within the uncertainties , implying that luminosity brightening does not strongly bias the ( evolving ) luminosity - selected sample .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath1 derived merger rates for similarly- selected parent samples are significantly larger than the close - pair derived major merger rates ( tables 2 and 4 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the simulation predictions that @xmath1 selected mergers span a wider range of mass ratio ( 1:1- 1:10 ) than the close pair major - merger studies ( 1:1 -1:4 ) .",
    "we estimate the minor merger ( 1:4 @xmath345 1:10 ) rate by subtracting the best - fit close pair merger rate from the @xmath1 merger rate ( table 4 ) .",
    "the fractional and volume - averaged minor merger rates are @xmath7 times the major merger rates at @xmath8 , and suggest weaker evolution in the minor merger rate than the major merger rate at @xmath75 .",
    "\\(4 ) the merger rates derived from observations of the fraction of asymmetric galaxies are highly uncertain ( table 3 ) .",
    "different methodologies for correcting asymmetry for surface - brightness dimming , sky noise , and false merger contamination result in a factor of 10 discrepancy in the literature values of the fraction of asymmetric galaxies .",
    "the theoretical average observability timescales add a factor of a few uncertainty to the asymmetry merger rate , because of their dependence on the unknown distribution of @xmath146 .",
    "the asymmetry - derived merger rates generally fall between the close - pair major merger rates and the @xmath1 major+minor rates , as expected for the range of predicted merger mass ratios for asymmetric galaxies ( @xmath346 ) .",
    "\\(5 ) we have also measured the galaxy merger rates for samples selected with roughly constant co - moving number density ( @xmath347 mpc@xmath328 ) .",
    "this selection results in stronger evolution in the merger rate , because it probes fainter / less massive galaxies at higher @xmath134 and brighter / more massive galaxies at low @xmath134 than fixed stellar mass selection .",
    "this selection also is expected to better track progenitor - descendant populations , and better match dark matter halo merger rate calculations .",
    "strong evolution in the major merger rates at roughly constant co - moving number density are observed ( table 4 ) , with @xmath329 and @xmath348 .",
    "however , the inferred minor merger rates at constant number density evolve weakly with redshift .",
    "\\(6 ) the major - merger rates and their evolution with redshift for stellar - mass selected close pairs are in excellent agreement with a number of recent galaxy evolution models ( hopkins et al .",
    "2010b , s08 , c06 , st09 ) .",
    "the ` total ' merger rates for stellar - mass selected @xmath1 mergers is significantly higher than the 1:1 -1:10 and 1:-1:30 stellar - mass ratio merger rates for the same models .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath1 merger rate is over - estimated , or that the models incompletely sample low - mass satellite galaxies and minor mergers",

    "<S> calculating the galaxy merger rate requires both a census of galaxies identified as merger candidates , and a cosmologically - averaged ` observability ' timescale @xmath0 for identifying galaxy mergers . while many have counted galaxy mergers using a variety of techniques , @xmath0 for these techniques have been poorly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we address this problem by calibrating three merger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and three galaxy formation models . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath0 for ( 1 ) close galaxy pairs with a range of projected separations , ( 2 ) the morphology indicator @xmath1 , and ( 3 ) the morphology indicator asymmetry @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . then we apply these timescales to the observed merger fractions at @xmath3 from the recent literature . </S>",
    "<S> when our physically - motivated timescales are adopted , the observed galaxy merger rates become largely consistent . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining differences between the galaxy merger rates are explained by the differences in the range of mass - ratio measured by different techniques and differing parent galaxy selection . the major merger rate per unit co - moving volume for samples selected with constant number density evolves much more strongly with redshift ( @xmath4 ) than samples selected with constant stellar mass or passively evolving luminosity ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the minor merger rate ( 1:4 @xmath6 1:10 ) by subtracting the major merger rate from close pairs from the ` total ' merger rate determined by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the implied minor merger rate is @xmath7 times the major merger rate at @xmath8 , and shows little evolution with redshift . </S>"
