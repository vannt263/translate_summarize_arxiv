    "the dynamical state of the stellar cluster around the massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic center ( gc ) , and the mechanisms that determine it , are of interest because such systems are ubiquitous in the universe , and because the gc is by far the most observationally accessible of them .",
    "the key question is whether the gc is dynamically relaxed @xcite .",
    "an unrelaxed system reflects its particular formation history .",
    "in contrast , the properties of a relaxed system can be understood and modeled from first principles , independently of initial conditions , and extrapolated to other relaxed galaxies .",
    "the gc , like other galactic nuclei with low - mass mbhs , is expected to be dynamically relaxed if it evolved passively in isolation @xcite , and consequently to have a centrally concentrated power - law stellar cusp , with a density profile @xmath10 , where @xmath11 @xcite ( figure [ f : imfs ] ) .",
    "however , recent photometric and spectroscopic studies of the stellar distribution in the gc @xcite indicate that the radial density profile of the spectroscopically identified low - mass red giants on the @xmath12 pc scale , thought to trace the long - lived population there , rises inward much less steeply than expected in steady state , or even decreases toward the center",
    ".    the core in the spatial distribution of the old red giants could still be consistent with a relaxed gc , if some mechanism selectively destroys giants , or rejuvenates them to appear as hot stars ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , all such processes proposed to date ( e.g. envelope stripping by star - giant collisions , @xcite ; tidal heating , @xcite ) are ineffective outside the central @xmath13 pc .",
    "the simplest interpretation for the missing old cusp is that , contrary to expectations , the gc is not dynamically relaxed by two - body interactions .",
    "one possibility is that the cusp is continuously and rapidly drained into the mbh by faster competing dynamical processes @xcite , in particular resonant relaxation @xcite .",
    "however , a recent exact derivation of the 2-body relaxation rate @xcite suggest that it is fast enough to maintain a high density steady state cusp on the relevant spatial scales , even in the presence of resonant relaxation . another possibility , which may well explain the observed cores in the light distributions of galaxies with more massive mbhs @xcite , is that a cosmologically recent major merger event with another mbh carved out a central cavity in the stellar distribution @xcite . this would then mean that the gc has not evolved in isolation , and is not in steady state but still slowly evolving back to it .",
    "there are however strong reasons to suspect that the gc is evolving at a rate faster than that of slow 2-body relaxation .",
    "the latest star formation episode in the gc formed @xmath14 very massive stars @xcite , which will likely leave behind stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "there are indications that a similar star formation episode occurred @xmath15 ago @xcite , as well as further indications of continuous star formation in the gc over a substantial fraction of the hubble time on various spatial scales @xcite .",
    "the estimated number of bhs produced in the inner parsec in the course of such a star formation history , @xmath16 , is in itself large enough to lower the local relaxation time below the hubble time @xcite .",
    "in addition , the massive gas structures presently observed just outside the mbh s radius of influence at @xmath17 ( gas clumps and giant molecular clouds ) , act as massive perturbers @xcite and can likewise lower the relaxation time below the hubble time even well inside the radius of influence @xcite . even if the gc has undergone a cusp - scouring merger event , the re - formation rate of the mass - segregated cusp of stellar bhs",
    "is expected to be faster than that of the luminous , lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , numerical experiments indicate that the presence of a mass spectrum ( not included in the analysis of @xcite ) accelerates the dynamics to the extent that the cusp can reform in substantially less than a hubble time @xcite , for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "the existence or absence of a dark cusp has important implications for processes that involve strong interactions with the mbh , such as the emission of gravitational waves from compact objects that inspiral into it ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disruption of stars by the tidal field of the mbh and the resulting tidal flares ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for the modeling of dynamics very close to mbhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a dark cusp around the galactic mbh has crucial implications for the detection of relativistic effects in orbits of stars close to the galactic mbh ( the so called `` s - cluster '' ) @xcite , in particular by future high precision interferometric experiments such as gravity @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the simplest interpretation of the observations and the theoretical expectations , and the absence of other lines of evidence for a major merger in the milky way s past , suggests that the possibility that the observed red giants _ do not _ trace the total mass distribution , and that there _ does _ _ exist _ a dark cusp around the galactic mbh , should be considered and tested empirically .",
    "the dynamical upper limits on the dark distributed mass within the s - cluster in the inner arcsec are still at least two orders of magnitude higher than expected from theoretical constraints @xcite .",
    "direct detection of the dark cusp in the gc , for example by gravitational lensing @xcite or by x - ray emission from accretion @xcite , is very difficult .",
    "the most promising approach to detect the faint stars and compact remnants appears to be through their dynamical interactions with other stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are hints that the resonant torques by such a cusp can explain some properties of the different sub - populations in the gc @xcite , however the direct detection of these torques requires test stars on much shorter period orbits than are available at this time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we explore here a newly relevant * * dynamical method to probe the dark cusp in the gc : binary evaporation constraints .",
    "relatively loosely - bound binaries are gradually detached by interactions with the field stars around them ; for an assumed cusp model this then imposes limits on the properties of the surviving binary population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we invert the constraints , and use the existence of binaries in the gc to place upper limits on the product of the total number density and the second moment of the mass distribution , @xmath18 , or equivalently , a lower limit on the relaxation time @xmath19 , and thus constrain dynamical models of the gc .",
    "the challenge is to formulate the constraints in a way that provides robust estimates in spite of statistical nature of evaporation and the uncertainty in the binary s formation mechanism and dynamical age .",
    "it should be emphasized that although binaries can be destroyed by processes other than evaporation , this will not affect our estimates , which draw conclusions only from those binaries that do survive .",
    "these provide an upper limit on the effectiveness of each of the competing destruction mechanisms separately , evaporation included , and thereby allow constraining the physical parameters on which these processes depend .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the binary evaporation timescale and its relation to the 2-body energy relaxation timescale around a mbh are summarized in sec .",

    "in an isotropic , keplerian power - law cusp near an mbh , where the stellar space density falls as @xmath20 , the jeans equation implies that the 1d velocity dispersion is ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 . in a single mass population",

    "the relaxational parameter @xmath28 determined whether the relaxed steady state is in the strong segregation limit ( @xmath291 and @xmath30 ) or the weak segregation limit ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) @xcite . ] @xcite . unless stated otherwise , we adopt this value below .",
    "this velocity dispersion is in good agreement ( to within 10% ) with the one derived empirically by @xcite for the old stellar population on the @xmath33 pc scale .",
    "note that well within the radius of influence of the mbh ( @xmath34 pc in the gc ) , where the mbh dominates the potential , the stars are _ not _ in equipartition , as the velocity dispersion depends on the stellar mass only through the mass - dependence of the logarithmic slope , @xmath35 , which reflects mass segregation , and in steady state can vary between @xmath11 .",
    "this limits the relative variations of @xmath36 to less than @xmath37 in @xmath38 across the entire stellar mass range ( typically 3 orders of magnitudes in mass ) @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume here that all stars , as well as the centers of mass ( com ) of binaries , have the velocity dispersion given by eq .",

    "a binary of mass @xmath39 , mass ratio @xmath40 and binary semi - major axis ( sma ) @xmath41 is considered `` soft '' when its binding energy @xmath42 is less than the typical kinetic energy of the background stars of mean mass @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , @xmath72 where @xmath58 is assumed , and the last approximate equality also assumes @xmath47 .    note that since binary evaporation requires that the perturber s distance of closest approach be closer to one star than to the binary s center of mass , the contribution of extended massive perturbers , such as giant molecular clouds , to binary evaporation is substantially reduced ( see discussion in sec .",

    "another source of contamination , one that can not be decisively ruled out , is tidal capture of hierarchical triples in 4-body interactions with the mbh .",

    "mass segregation models of the gc , which assume a passive evolution of the nuclear cluster , predict the accumulation of a steady state high density cusp of stellar remnants @xcite . in steady state ,",
    "the rate at which stars are scattered into the mbh from some volume @xmath137 is balanced by the rate at which stars are replenished by 2-body relaxation from outside @xmath45 .",
    "the detailed calculation of the steady state density can be robustly bracketed by the conservative `` drain limit '' @xcite , which estimates the maximal number of objects that can survive against mutual 2-body scattering into the mbh over the age of the system .",

    "it then follows that the shortest possible relaxation time in steady state , which is attained at the maximal density of the drain limit ( substituting @xmath146 into eq .",

    "the evolution of a galactic nucleus to a relaxed steady state configuration can be approximated in terms of the evolution of the stellar distribution function ( df ) due to diffusion in phase space , and integrated in time from an arbitrary initial configuration to steady state by the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation .",
    "this scheme was first applied to a multi - mass system with a central mbh by @xcite , with the approximations that the potential is keplerian , the angular momentum diffusion is averaged , so that only diffusion in energy is integrated in time , and only non - coherent 2-body relaxation is considered .",
    "two boundary conditions are imposed , one at very high energy ( close to the mbh ) , where the df falls to zero , and one at the energy corresponding to the mbh s radius of influence ( @xmath165 in the gc ) , where the stellar number density of each mass is fixed to some value , which reflects its population ratio far from the dynamical influences of the mbh , and therefore depends only on the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) and the star - formation history .",

    "breakup driven by resonant relaxation could be more efficient , especially very near the mbh @xcite , where it could destroy binaries at a rate faster than 2-body relaxation replenishes them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , accelerated binary mergers can be induced by kozai perturbations by the mbh .",
    "this effect is expected to be relevant for the subset of high - inclination orbits close to the mbh @xcite . `   `    we have shown how the properties of a detected binary : location , mass , period , main - sequence lifespan , and the observed and deduced properties of the gc , the mbh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion , are translated to a lower bound on the 2-body relaxation time @xmath78 ( [ e : mintr ] ) and an upper bound on the second moment of the mass distribution , @xmath18 ( [ e : maxnm2 ] ) , _ independently of the uncertainties in the binary fraction in the gc_. in concise form , these bounds can be expressed in terms of the observed or derived binary properties : the main - sequence lifetime @xmath106 , the orbital velocity scale @xmath208 , the coulomb logarithm @xmath104 ( eq . [ e : l12 ] ) , and the maximal evolution ratio @xmath103 ( eq . [ e : sh ] ) , through the combination @xmath209 together with assumed model values for @xmath50 , the logarithmic slope of the stellar cusp , @xmath51 , the mean stellar mass , and the observed or modeled velocity dispersion @xmath105 ( eq . [ e : sig2 ] ) , the bounds on the relaxation time and stellar density are @xmath210 we have shown that the detection of such binaries could rule out the possibility of a maximally dense relaxed stellar cusp at the drain limit , and constrain more realistic relaxed dynamical models of the gc .    the key issue , and the main source of uncertainty , is to determine how long the binary spent in or near its observed location .",
    "the actual age ( as opposed to the lifespan ) of red giants can be estimated from the main - sequence lifespan of their progenitors , @xmath211 which in principle could provide @xmath212 to within 10% ( the typical relative duration of the post - main sequence phase ) .",
    "this is different from the case of young massive stars , whose age can only be bound by their main - sequence lifespan , @xmath213 , unless they can be associated with the stellar disk , whose age is known , @xmath214 .",
    "we have argued that local tidal or 3-body formation in the gc is negligible ( sec .",
    "[ ss:3body ] ) , and therefore the binaries orbiting the galactic mbh are either primordial and local , or primordial and captured by a @xmath215-body tidal interaction between a hierarchical triple and the mbh @xcite , in a variation of the @xcite mechanism . `   ` the fraction of such captured binaries among the local binaries is uncertain . they will spend a substantial fraction of the post - capture time on very eccentric orbits , until these are randomized @xcite , which may provide a way to identify them if they are relatively recently captured . in any case , under the plausible assumption that both their time of formation and their time of capture are random and distributed uniformly in time over their main - sequence lifespan @xmath216 , then their mean time in the gc is @xmath217 , which is within the expected uncertainty in the determination of the main - sequence lifetimes of the low - mass red giant binaries ( table [ t : rgs ] ) .",
    "the analysis presented here makes several simplifying assumptions , which should be relaxed and calculated in more detail .",
    "( 1 ) the estimates here are based on the present - day location of the binary in the gc , without orbital averaging . for long - lived binaries ,",
    "the evolution of the binary s orbit around the mbh is not negligible and should be also taken into account , as should the evolution of the nuclear cluster itself .",
    "( 2 ) the statistical fluctuations in the stochastic process of evaporation are not taken into account .",
    "evaporation should be expressed by survival probabilities , rather than by a single timescale .",
    "( 3 ) the estimates are based on the present - day binary parameters @xmath53 and @xmath52 and take into account only the dynamical evolution of soft binaries due to external interactions with stars .",
    "however , these parameters also evolve internally because of post - main sequence mass - loss , which is neglected here .",
    "issues ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in particular should be addressed by @xmath218-body modeling of the evaporation process .    finally , it should be stressed that binary evaporation is insensitive to relaxation by spatially extended massive perturbers ( e.g. giant molecular clouds , or dense clusters ) , which can shorten the relaxation time by many orders of magnitude @xcite , since these will not widen the binary , but rather scatter its center of mass .",
    "thus , @xmath219 is a limit on the point - like masses in the system ( stars , compact remnants and possibly also intermediate - mass bhs ) , and @xmath220 is a lower limit on the _ stellar _ 2-body relaxation timescale alone . the actual relaxation time due to both stars and extended massive perturbers",
    "may be shorter still .                                                                              , f. , et  al .",
