    "the electrochemical adsorption of a two - dimensional film on a metal electrode can involve a phase transition at the surface  @xcite .",
    "when the adsorbate  adsorbate interactions are attractive , this phase transition is of first order ; hence , below a critical temperature , there is a discontinuity in the coverage at a certain electrochemical potential .",
    "stepping across the electrostatic potential difference between electrode and solution that corresponds to this coexistence point induces adsorption ( or desorption ) . whereas , thermodynamically , this phase transformation is abrupt rather than gradual , its kinetics are governed by the microscopic mechanism by which it proceeds . on a flat , defect - free single - crystal surface ,",
    "the decay of the metastable phase takes place through nucleation and growth of two - dimensional clusters . the classical theory for this kind of phase change",
    "was developed in the 1930s and 40s by kolmogorov , johnson and mehl , and avrami ( kjma theory )  @xcite .",
    "finding successful application in many fields of science , it is also the basis for the interpretation of kinetic data of electrodeposition processes that proceed by nucleation and growth  @xcite .",
    "however , the assumptions of the theory may not always be met in real experimental systems . in particular ,",
    "an earlier study from our group indicates that homogeneous nucleation can also be instantaneous , and that there might be a gradual crossover from continuous to instantaneous nucleation  @xcite .",
    "this casts some doubt on whether the nucleation is spatially uncorrelated  @xcite .",
    "lattice - gas models are now a widely applied tool in the study of electrochemical adsorption  @xcite .",
    "they are appropriate when the adsorbate layer is commensurate with the substrate  @xcite .",
    "when the adsorbate is in quasi - equilibrium with the bulk under control of the electrode potential , a grand - canonical hamiltonian should be used .",
    "kinetic monte carlo simulations  @xcite of lattice - gas models can be used to study the dynamics of such systems when they can be well approximated as a superposition of independent , stochastic processes  @xcite .",
    "this is generally true when the elementary processes evolve through thermally activated crossings of well - defined transition states .",
    "then , one should choose an arrhenius - type monte carlo dynamic  @xcite .",
    "for the investigation of the model dynamics at macroscopic time scales this is the method of choice , since it does not rely on mathematical approximations and since it coarse - grains over the fluctuations ( vibrations ) whose time scales are orders of magnitude faster than adsorption , diffusion , etc . with this method real problems",
    "have been tackled and successfully described  @xcite , for example for underpotential deposition of metals  @xcite . however",
    ", the problem may require substantial effort in providing a sufficiently realistic description .",
    "for example , one may need to include coadsorption of anions , long - range or many - body potentials  @xcite , etc .    here",
    "we follow a somewhat different approach . rather than in a specific system",
    ", we are interested in the general behavior of two - dimensional first - order phase transitions . hence we choose as a model system a two - dimensional square lattice gas with nearest - neighbor attractive interactions .",
    "no solvent or counter ions are included .",
    "this model can be interpreted as a simplified description of electrochemical metal underpotential deposition or of the early stages of epitaxial growth when no nucleation takes place in the second layer . however , since it is isomorphic to the square - lattice ising model  @xcite , it is far more general and may , among other phenomena , also describe ferromagnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the influence of nearest - neighbor adsorbate diffusion on the dynamics of the phase transformation . unlike in vacuum surface science ,",
    "adsorbate diffusion is not a condition for nucleation since fluctuations in cluster sizes can also be mediated by the quasi - equilibrium with the solution ( instead of the two - dimensional gas of adsorbed particles ) .",
    "likewise , an earlier study  @xcite has shown that the phase - transformation dynamics of this lattice gas can be well described by the kjma theory for continuous nucleation over a wide range of potentials in the _ absence _ of adsorbate diffusion ( in magnetic terms , spin flip only ) .",
    "another preliminary study  @xcite suggests that in the _ presence _ of diffusion ( spin exchange in magnetic language ) the dynamics may change .",
    "for fast diffusion , the phase transformation appeared to proceed by instantaneous nucleation , and for intermediate diffusion rates there was a gradual crossover .",
    "this was interpreted as a result of exclusion zones around the clusters , in which nucleation was suppressed .",
    "it was speculated that these exclusion zones may become space - filling in the early stages of the phase transformation .",
    "the crossover also changed the morphology of the adsorbate phase .",
    "however , the study used glauber instead of arrhenius dynamics and was limited to one value of the electrochemical potential . here",
    "we extend the study to a wide range of potentials .",
    "furthermore , we present a more stringent analysis of the kinetic data and use microscopic details of the simulation for comparison with the theory .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ par : results : continuum ] we discuss the accuracy of the continuum description of the kjma theory , and in sec .  [ par : results : onsetcrover ] we discuss under which conditions the crossover to instantaneous nucleation occurs .",

    "[ par : summary ] .",
    "a description of the @xmath3-fold way algorithm for adsorption / desorption _ and _ diffusion can be found in the appendix .",
    "we here briefly review the kjma theory and describe how we adapt it for a gradual crossover between continuous and instantaneous nucleation .",
    "the basic assumption of the kjma theory is that nucleation events are _ random _ and _ uncorrelated_. then , it is mathematically quite simple to correct for the overlap of growing circular droplets , provided that they do not change shape upon coalescence  @xcite .",
    "one defines an _ extended coverage _  @xmath4 by summing up the areas of all growing droplets regardless of overlap with other clusters , and normalizes this by the total surface area .",
    "when the radius  @xmath5 of a cluster is a function of its birth time  @xmath6 , this reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of clusters of radius  @xmath5 per surface area , and @xmath9 is the nucleation rate at time  @xmath10 .",
    "the last equality is for circular clusters with a radius growing linearly with an interface velocity  @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to realize that this nucleation rate includes nucleation events in the transformed area , since otherwise the condition of random , uncorrelated nucleation would be violated  @xcite .",
    "there has been some confusion concerning this point  @xcite .",
    "we therefore call the nucleation rate  @xmath9 the _ extended nucleation rate _ wherever the distinction is important . in the system we consider in our investigation ,",
    "nucleation is homogeneous and proceeds by thermal fluctuations .",
    "it can be described by classical nucleation theory  @xcite , but we do not address this question further here .",
    "when @xmath0 is constant throughout the phase transformation , we speak of _ continuous nucleation _ , and performing the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ext_cov ] ) yields @xmath11 here , @xmath0 has the dimension @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that the `` real '' nucleation rate  @xmath13 is reduced by the fraction of the covered surface @xmath14 and eventually decreases to zero ; this is not to be confused with a decaying extended nucleation rate ( see below ) . at early times , though , the real nucleation rate can be used as an estimate for the extended nucleation rate , since @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , when all nuclei are already present at the very beginning of the phase transformation and no further nucleation takes place , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a dirac delta function , and the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ext_cov ] ) yields @xmath18 this _ instantaneous nucleation _ is often associated with heterogeneous nucleation at defects . here",
    ", @xmath0 has the dimension @xmath19 since it is virtually a surface density of nucleation centers .",
    "the real coverage can be calculated from the extended coverage  @xmath14 by  @xcite @xmath20 the quantity @xmath21 is called the relaxation function ( in the kjma theory ) .",
    "we will later define a relaxation function for our model system and use @xmath21 as a coarse - grained approximation for it  @xcite .",
    "the gradual crossover from continuous to instantaneous nucleation with increasing diffusion rate implies that , for some intermediate diffusion rates , the extended nucleation rate  @xmath0 is neither a constant nor a delta function , but decays with time . in the following ,",
    "we deduce how an exponentially decaying extended nucleation rate @xmath22 with @xmath23 the initial nucleation rate and @xmath24 an inverse decay time translates into a @xmath25 relation for the coverage .",
    "the dimension of @xmath23 is @xmath12 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay_nucl ] ) , @xmath9 is independent of the position .",
    "this is a mean - field approximation , in which any local reduction of the nucleation rate is smeared out over the whole surface . within this approximation",
    ", nucleation remains spatially uncorrelated , and avrami s law  [ eq .  ( [ eq : avrami ] ) ] holds .",
    "hence we need to calculate the extended coverage that follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay_nucl ] ) . inserting @xmath9 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ext_cov ] ) and performing the integration yields @xmath26 in the limit of @xmath27 , the second and the third term are of the order of @xmath28 and @xmath29 smaller than the first term , and we recover the well - known result for instantaneous nucleation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ext_cov_inst ] ) , with @xmath30 . in the limit @xmath31 , the exponential can be expanded up to third order , which is the lowest non - vanishing order , and we recover the well - known result for continuous nucleation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ext_cov_cont ] ) , with @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the exponential decay of the extended nucleation rate is not derived from a physical model , but rather simply a mathematically convenient assumption .",
    "moreover , in real systems as well as in our microscopic model system , the reduction of the nucleation rate is thought to be _ local _ in exclusion zones around existing clusters .",
    "this would violate the assumption that nucleation events are uncorrelated .",
    "such correlations are ignored by the theory presented .",
    "a theory that includes these effects could not make use of avrami s law .",
    "a fit of experimental or simulation results for the relaxation function to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : avrami ] ) and ( [ eq : ext_cov_decay ] ) can yield estimates for @xmath24 and for @xmath33 , but no separate estimates for @xmath23 and @xmath1 .",
    "we model the electrodeposition process using a square lattice - gas model with attractive nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "since the subcritical fluctuations of the adsorbate are at quasi - equilibrium , a grand - canonical hamiltonian is used : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lateral interaction constant and @xmath36 the electrochemical potential of the adsorbing ion in the solution   ising model with @xmath37 nearest neighbors ( here , @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 sites , coupling constant @xmath40 and external magnetic field @xmath41 , the mapping between the models is @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  @xcite . ] .",

    "the occupation variables @xmath47 take the value 0 when site  @xmath48 is empty , and 1 when it is occupied .",
    "we perform simulations for an @xmath49 lattice with periodic boundary conditions , using for all simulations the interaction constant @xmath50 and the temperature @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the critical temperature of the ising model for the given parameters  @xcite .",
    "energy and temperature units are chosen such that boltzmann s constant @xmath53 .",
    "the dynamics of the phase transformation are investigated using kinetic monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the model dynamics can be reasonably approximated by a few stochastic elementary processes ; hence , we choose one - step arrhenius - type dynamics  @xcite for the transition probabilities , introducing a local transition barrier @xmath54 .",
    "the transition rate  @xmath55 for a transition from configuration  @xmath56 to configuration  @xmath57 is approximated by the corresponding rate for a transition from @xmath56 to a fictitious transition state : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy at the transition state . using a symmetric ( @xmath60 ) butler - volmer- ( brnsted-)type expression for @xmath59  @xcite : @xmath61 one obtains @xmath62 where @xmath63 sets the monte carlo time scale and",
    "will be chosen as unity in the following .",
    "another choice for an arrhenius - type dynamic is the transition - dynamic algorithm  @xcite .    for each kind of elementary step that is included in our model simulations ,",
    "we specify a value for the transition barrier  @xmath54 . in particular , these are @xmath64 for adsorption / desorption steps and @xmath65 for diffusion steps to a nearest - neighbor site .",
    "the former is equivalent to a spin - flip step , the latter to a spin - exchange step in the terminology of magnetic spin models . by varying the difference @xmath66 we can set the ratio between adsorption / desorption and diffusion steps .",
    "the absolute values have no particular meaning unless we attempt to specify the relation between physical and monte carlo time scales  @xcite .",
    "we treat @xmath54 as merely formal and note that , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : butler_volmer ] ) , @xmath59 might not be larger than both @xmath67 and @xmath68 for a strongly exothermic or endothermic step , viz not represent a true barrier , even for positive @xmath54 . in the monte carlo algorithm chosen , transition rates @xmath69 pose no problem ( see below ) .    at high diffusion rates , standard monte carlo algorithms are",
    "prohibitively slow since much simulation time is spent on the coverage - conserving diffusion steps .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use more advanced methods : we choose the @xmath3-fold way algorithm of bortz , kalos and lebowitz  @xcite and gilmer  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is rejection - free : of all possible new configurations , one is chosen with probability @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , and then accepted with probability 1 .",
    "no time is spent on choosing sites and calculating energy differences for rejected moves . after each step the simulation time",
    "is updated by @xmath72mcss ( monte carlo steps per site ) , where @xmath5 is drawn from a uniform pseudo - random distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "we need to keep a list of the transition rates for all possible moves from the actual configuration .",
    "this is done for a single - site @xmath3-fold way as follows .",
    "for each site  @xmath73 in the lattice we compute the transition rate  @xmath74 for every possible elementary step  @xmath75 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans_prob ] ) : adsorption / desorption ( @xmath76 ; adsorption when site is empty , desorption otherwise ) ; exchange with nearest neighbor to the right ( @xmath77 ; equal to zero when both are occupied or both are empty ) , exchange with nearest neighbor below ( @xmath78 ; equal to zero when both are occupied or both are empty ) .",
    "this minimizes the possible steps per site and makes sure that every possible diffusion step on the lattice is counted once .",
    "we then calculate the total rate at which site  @xmath73 performs a move as @xmath79 . in a monte carlo step ,",
    "a random number is drawn from a uniform distribution to choose with probability @xmath80 the site @xmath73 that performs the next move .",
    "then , another random number is drawn to choose with probability @xmath81 which elementary step @xmath75 is performed .",
    "finally , a third random number is drawn to choose the time step by which the simulation clock is updated .",
    "after that , the respective @xmath55 and @xmath82 of all sites that are affected by the move are updated . in order to accelerate this process ,",
    "the latter are stored in a binary tree .",
    "recognizing that there is a finite number of configurations of a site plus environment , each characterized by an energy that is constant throughout the simulation , it is in principle possible to tabulate the energy differences that are connected with each change of local configuration ( called classes ) .",
    "this has previously been worked out for the square ising lattice without spin - exchange ( diffusion )  @xcite , where 10 classes are to be considered for adsorption / desorption . here , we additionally have to define 32 classes for the diffusion step ; our @xmath3-fold way is hence a 42-fold way algorithm .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the diffusion step calls for including a larger portion of the lattice into the affected environment of a site .",
    "we have to consider a total of 21 classes up to third - nearest neighbor positions after an adsorption / desorption step and of 31 classes up to fourth - nearest neighbor positions after a diffusion step .",
    "details are shown in the appendix .",
    "our goal is the investigation of the influence of diffusion on the dynamics of the first - order phase transition .",
    "to that end , we vary the diffusion barrier @xmath65 between 5 and 15 , keeping @xmath83 constant .",
    "moreover , we perform simulations without diffusion , corresponding to @xmath84 .",
    "we start our simulations with an empty lattice , and at @xmath85 we set the electrochemical potential to a value between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the electrochemical potential at coexistence .",
    "for all these values of the electrochemical potential , the phase transformation is in the multi - droplet regime  @xcite , where the number of supercritical adsorbate clusters is large . for each set of parameters ,",
    "we perform 500 to 1000 independent simulation runs .",
    "this high number is necessary to accurately obtain the variance of the coverage . for quantities that do not depend on higher moments ,",
    "we typically take statistics from only about 100 runs .",
    "we sample the coverage  @xmath14 as a function of the simulation time .",
    "moreover , we follow the size of every cluster in the lattice throughout the simulation until the coverage reaches @xmath89 ; this enables us to get microscopic interface velocities and nucleation rates .",
    "later , cluster sizes are obtained using the hoshen - kopelman algorithm  @xcite at certain coverages .",
    "we compute the time - dependent two - point correlation function  ( see ref .",

    "transform algorithm  @xcite , this approach is significantly faster than the direct calculation of @xmath98 .",
    "we only report the circularly averaged @xmath99 .",
    "our interest is in the influence of diffusion on the kinetics and dynamics of the phase transformation .",
    "it is therefore necessary to first characterize how the fraction of steps that are diffusion steps depends on the model parameters .",
    "we count the diffusion steps and divide their number by the number of total steps . since the time step by which the clock is updated after a successful move does not depend systematically on the type of move performed , this simpler approach is approximately equivalent to computing true rates of the elementary processes . figure  [ fig : diffrate ] shows that the fraction of diffusion steps changes only weakly during the phase transformation . hence , it is sufficient to discuss the average fraction of diffusion steps throughout the whole simulation . in table  [",
    "tab : diffrate ] , we show that the diffusion fraction increases strongly with decreasing diffusion barrier @xmath65 , reflecting the exponential law , eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans_prob ] ) , and increases weakly with the electrochemical potential , reflecting that diffusing particles spend on average longer time on the surface before they desorb . with @xmath100 ,",
    "diffusion is the predominant process .",
    "the critical cluster size  @xmath101 is governed by the balance of volume and surface free - energy terms of the clusters  @xcite ; it hence depends on the interaction constant @xmath35 ( which we keep constant ) , and on the electrochemical potential @xmath36 ( which we vary ) .",
    "the critical cluster size is the number of particles @xmath3 in the cluster for which the free energy @xmath102 has a maximum .",
    "we calculate @xmath103 from the restricted partition function @xmath104 , which we obtain from enumerating lattice animals , hence counting all possible configurations of a given cluster size  @xcite .",
    "the resulting critical cluster size is shown as a function of @xmath36 in table  [ tab : critcl ] .",
    "as expected , it decreases with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "we characterize the phase transformation using the relaxation function  @xmath105  @xcite , which is closely related to @xmath106 and decays from 1 to 0 during the adsorption .",
    "it is defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the stable coverage , which depends on the electrochemical potential and is easily obtained from equilibrium monte carlo simulations .",
    "we define the metastable lifetime  @xmath109 as the time when @xmath110 .",

    "we normalize the time scale with the metastable lifetime ; then , when only the time scale of the phase transformation changes and not the dynamics , the plots should collapse .",

    "the difference between the net nucleation and coalescence rates is the net rate at which supercritical clusters are formed .",
    "its integral over time perfectly reproduces the time - dependent densities of supercritical clusters , corroborating the accuracy of our cluster - counting method and analysis .    in the absence of diffusion ,",
    "the decrease of the real nucleation rate comes from the reduction of the free surface area .",

    "when the microscopic net nucleation rate reaches its maximum , the net coalescence rates are still close to zero .",
    "this implies that the real nucleation rates at early times so obtained should be a good estimate for the extended nucleation rate , since the microscopic nucleation rate is reasonably well separated from coalescence processes .",

    "this corresponds to a transmission factor of about @xmath132 for the diffusional motion across the nucleation barrier in @xmath3-space .",
    "for fast diffusion rates the discrepancy is a little larger , which might be an effect of the absence of exclusion zones in which no nucleation can take place in these `` simulations of the metastable phase '' .",
    "we emphasize that no real metastable phase is produced by this method since the complete desorption of supercritical clusters disturbs the quasi - equilibrium .",
    "the time - dependent law for the extended nucleation rate that we used for the analysis of the phase - transformation dynamics is a mean - field approximation whose accuracy is difficult to predict ( see section  [ par : theo : decaynucl ] ) .",
    "our simulations have shown a strong decrease of the real nucleation rates in the presence of fast diffusion .",

    "in particular , the incomplete separation of the time scales for the formation and the decay of the metastable phase is a potential source for deviations and limits the quality of the curve fitting .",
    "introducing an additional fitting parameter that shifts the time scale might improve the ability of the model to fit the shape of the phase - transformation curves , but its physical meaning would be questionable .    in the limit of instantaneous nucleation , @xmath180 should equal the density of nuclei .",

    "we point out that the presented theory does not account for spatial correlations between the nuclei that are a consequence of the diffusion - induced exclusion zones .",
    "it is difficult to anticipate the consequences of an appropriate extension of the theory .",
    "however , since these correlations shift the overlap between growing extended clusters to later times , accelerating the phase transformation at early times , one might speculate that the discrepancies in @xmath2 would rather increase .",
    "we conclude that even though some of the assumptions behind the kjma theory are not strictly fulfilled , it still provides a reasonable description of the phase - transformation kinetics of the ising lattice gas .",
    "the effects of adsorbate diffusion can in part be accounted for by assuming a decaying nucleation rate .",
    "this effectively yields a crossover from continuous to instantaneous nucleation when diffusion is the predominant process .",
    "our previous results have shown that a crossover of the nucleation from continuous to instantaneous sets in when the fit of the relaxation function to eqs .",

    "this makes it suitable for submonolayer electrochemical deposition under control of the potential difference between solution and electrode and when mass - transport limitations to the surface are insignificant .",
    "the elementary steps included in the model are adsorption , desorption , and diffusion ; our main interest is in the influence of the latter on the phase - transformation dynamics .",
    "the diffusion rates can be controlled by the barrier height for the diffusion steps .",
    "we have obtained results for the phase - transformation kinetics , the adsorbate morphology , and the microscopic rates of nucleation , cluster growth ( interface velocity ) , and coalescence . for our model calculations",
    "we have used an extension of bortz et al.s @xmath3-fold way algorithm that contains both adsorption ( spin - flip ) and diffusion ( spin - exchange ) , and whose details we present in this paper .",
    "the nucleation rate and the interface velocity and consequently the phase - transformation kinetics are accelerated by both an increase of the supersaturation ( the driving force ) and the diffusion rate .",
    "the higher the diffusion rate , the more likely it is that a walker aggregates with sub- or supercritical clusters to participate in nucleation or growth , respectively .    around supercritical clusters , diffusion causes a local reduction of the nucleation rate in a zone with the extension of the monomer diffusion length , since it is more likely that monomers reach the existing cluster than that they create a new one .",
    "this causes a reduction of the cluster density and an increase of the correlation length",

    "though , the exclusion zones around supercritical clusters grow with the cluster radius , such that the real nucleation rate diminishes more strongly with time than expected from the decrease of the free surface fraction ( and than in the case without diffusion ) . assuming an extended nucleation rate that decreases exponentially with time from an initial value @xmath23 , we can extend the analysis to this case and still extract an estimate for @xmath33 .",
    "this estimate is less accurate , but still correct by order of magnitude .",
    "we emphasize that correlation effects , which are also important in these cases , are neglected , since we use avrami s law . when diffusion is predominant , the exclusion zones become space - filling at early times of the phase transformation , and the dynamics resemble instantaneous nucleation .",

    "we emphasize that nucleation is still homogeneous .",
    "hence , in the electrodeposition of a two - dimensional film that proceeds by a first - order phase transition , instantaneous nucleation need not imply heterogeneous nucleation at defects .",
    "also , intermediate cases are possible that would lead to non - linear avrami plots and non - integer avrami exponents . a strong indication for our model to be a good description of a given experimental system could be found in the two - point correlation functions , which develop minima for an avrami exponent less then 3",

    "this theory is based on spatially random nucleation as well , and the analysis breaks down when diffusion rates become noticeable and a minimum in the correlation function appears .",
    "the time a walker spends on the surface before it desorbs increases with higher supersaturation , such that in this case the influence of diffusion on the dynamics of the phase transformation at the same rate is stronger .",
    "hence , the crossover to instantaneous nucleation is more complete for the same diffusion barrier when the supersaturation is greater .    in a previous work",

    "<S> the influence of lateral adsorbate diffusion on the dynamics of the first - order phase transition in a two - dimensional ising lattice gas with attractive nearest - neighbor interactions is investigated by means of kinetic monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , electrochemical underpotential deposition proceeds by this mechanism . one major difference from adsorption in vacuum surface science </S>",
    "<S> is that under control of the electrode potential and in the absence of mass - transport limitations , local adsorption equilibrium is approximately established . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze our results using the theory of kolmogorov , johnson and mehl , and avrami ( kjma ) , which we extend to an exponentially decaying nucleation rate . </S>",
    "<S> such a decay may occur due to a suppression of nucleation around existing clusters in the presence of lateral adsorbate diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> correlation functions prove the existence of such exclusion zones . by comparison with microscopic results for the nucleation rate  @xmath0 and the interface velocity of the growing clusters  @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we can show that the kjma theory yields the correct order of magnitude for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is true even though the spatial correlations mediated by diffusion are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the decaying nucleation rate causes a gradual crossover from continuous to instantaneous nucleation , which is complete when the decay of the nucleation rate is very fast on the time scale of the phase transformation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , instantaneous nucleation can be homogeneous , producing negative minima in the two - point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we also present in this paper an @xmath3-fold way monte carlo algorithm for a square lattice gas with adsorption / desorption _ and _ lateral diffusion .    </S>",
