    "high amplification gains are required in micro - pattern gaseous detectors ( mpgd ) in order to achieve a comfortable signal to noise ratio , therefore improving the performance of detectors in terms of spatial resolution and efficiency .",
    "the dense electron avalanches achieved at high gains with few primary electrons entail the risk of producing a discharge at the cathode of the detector when the critical electron density of @xmath1 electrons per avalanche is reached ( related to the raether limit  @xcite ) .",
    "discharges might affect the detector response in different ways ;    * _ reducing its operating lifetime _ due to intense currents produced in short periods of time , heating and melting the materials at the affected regions , * _ damaging the readout electronics _ which have to support huge current loads , * _ increasing the detector dead - time _ resulting from a _ _ discharge of the cathode__.",
    "it was first observed in rpc - type detectors that the introduction of a high impedance resistive coating at the anode limits the detector current , constraining the spark process to the streamer phase during a time interval of at least some microseconds . thus reducing the total amount of charge released  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the limited discharge current affects the field locally , thus reducing the dead - time of the detector which remains operative in non - affected regions .",
    "micromegas detectors were introduced in 1996  @xcite as a good candidate for high particle flux environments , and spark studies with detectors based on micromegas technology were also carried out  @xcite . recently , additional efforts have pushed the development of resistive strip micromegas detectors in order to further increase its robustness in high particle flux environments by limiting spark discharges in the same way as it was done for rpcs . in particular , the mamma collaboration  @xcite is developing large area micromegas detectors and introduced the resistive coating technique  @xcite for the upgrade of the hl - lhc@xmath2s@xmath3 ) ] .",
    "the existing micromegas technology  @xcite allowed the mamma collaboration to investigate detector prototypes with different resistive coating topologies  @xcite .",
    "this new type of detectors will be installed in atlas at the new small wheel project .",
    "thus , it should be proved to be long term radiation resistant .",
    "the introduction of a new technology made of new materials adds some uncertainties of operation during long periods of time in intense particle flux environments .",
    "the results that we report here represent the first ageing tests with this type of detectors using different types of highly ionizing radiations .",
    "an ageing study of resistive - anode detectors is required to operate these type of detectors at the hl - lhc . for this study , two new identical micromegas prototypes ( named r17 )",
    "were used , lent by the mamma collaboration and built at the cern workshop .",
    "these detectors are based on a resistive strips technology @xcite with a 2-dimensional readout .",
    "the x and y readout strips are in copper .",
    "the top y strips have been covered by a 60@xmath4 m thick insulating coverlay .",
    "the 35@xmath4 m thick resistive strips are placed on top of this layer parallel to the x strips .    both resistive and copper strips have a pitch of 250@xmath4 m and a width of 150@xmath4 m .",
    "the resistivity along the strips and boundary resistance value was measured during the fabrication process . the first detector , r17a , showed a linear resistivity of 45 - 50 m@xmath5cm@xmath3 , and a boundary resistance of 80 - 140 m@xmath5 .",
    "the resistivity obtained for the second detector , r17b , was comparable with a linear resistivity of 35 - 40 m@xmath5cm@xmath3 and a boundary resistance of 60 - 100 m@xmath5 .    a first characterization in ar+co@xmath7 mixtures , and ar + 7% co@xmath7 for the test beam performance .",
    "] showed that the gain behaved as expected , and the results obtained with both detectors , r17a and r17b , were comparable .",
    "figure  [ resist_princ ] shows the gain curves in these mixtures .",
    "ageing tests took place at different cea - saclay facilities , one prototype ( r17b ) was kept unexposed as a reference and the other ( r17a ) was exposed to different types of radiations including x - rays , cold neutrons , high energetic gammas , and alphas .",
    "these tests will be described in the following sections .",
    "the prototype under test was placed inside a cage with a high intensity x - ray generator , which emits in all the x - range up to few kev , with a copper fluorescence at 8kev .",
    "a mask was prepared by using an aluminum plate with a 4 @xmath8 hole aperture .",
    "the plate was placed on top , and it was always fixed in the same position .",
    "the radiation exposure tests aim to accumulate an amount of charge comparable to the values that will be integrated during the lifetime of the hl - lhc .",
    "the estimation of the total charge produced at the hl - lhc in the muon chambers of atlas is based on the energy deposit @xmath9 of a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) in a 0.5 cm micromegas conversion gap . in our gas mixture @xmath10 kev .",
    "considering the detector gain @xmath11 , the charge produced by each incident particle at the hl - lhc    @xmath12    where @xmath13 ev is the mean ionization energy of the gas . taking into account a nominal gain of g=5,000 ,",
    "the charge produced per mip yields @xmath14 fc .    assuming the expected rate at the hl - lhc future muon chambers will be 10 khz/@xmath8 , the total charge generated in 5 years of operation ( 200 days / year )",
    "will be 32.3 mc/@xmath8 .",
    "the flux produced at the x - ray generator will accumulate an amount of charge well above this value for an exposure of a few days .    the detector has been exposed for more than 20 days with a gain of 5,000 and a gas flow of one renewal per hour .",
    "the current remained stable ( see figure  [ xray_current ] ) , proving the detector gain was not affected on the whole irradiation period , which corresponds to 21.3 days of exposure and an integrated charge of 918 mc , that is 5 years of hl - lhc with a security factor above 7 .",
    "the gain of both detectors was measured using an @xmath15fe source at different positions , before and after exposure .",
    "we used a dedicated 9-hole mask which covers the full active area of the detector in one of its axis .",
    "these measurements took place before the ageing period ( 26-sep-2011 ) , when the grounding connectors were removed ( 8-oct-2011 ) and after the exposure ( 19-oct-2011 ) ( further details can be found at references @xcite ) .",
    "the relative gain at each position for these three sets of measurements is plotted in figure  [ gain_profile ] and shows that the gain profile is compatible with previous measurements .",
    "moreover , the exposed detector region does not show any significant difference in relative gain compared to the other , non - exposed regions .",
    "the x - rays irradiation had therefore no effect on the detector response .",
    "neutron irradiation took place at the orphe reactor in cea - saclay .",
    "the reactor , which operates only for research purposes , is connected to different lines which guide different fluxes of cold neutrons produced in the reactor .",
    "the line where the detector was installed provides a neutron beam of about 8@xmath1610@xmath17@xmath2s@xmath3 , with energies in the range of 5 - 10mev within an area of a few @xmath8 .",
    "different irradiation periods were scheduled with an increased time exposure .",
    "the mesh current remained stable and at the same level in each of these periods ( see figure  [ neutron_current ] ) .",
    "the expected neutron flux at the csc ( cathode strip chamber ) in atlas is about 3@xmath1610@xmath18 @xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "the total exposure time of the prototype r17a was more than 40 hours , accumulating a total amount of neutron flux which is equivalent to 5 years of operation of the hl - lhc with a safety factor well above  10 .",
    "before and after the neutron tests the gain was measured using the same 9-hole mask used for the tests described in the previous section .",
    "the gain profile is compatible and the performance of the detector shows no degradation with respect to the measurements before neutron irradiation ( see figure  [ neutron_profile ] ) .          after proving that the detector r17a was operating properly it was installed at the cocase  @xcite gamma facility , which provides a high activity @xmath0co source , of about 500 mgy / h , emitting gammas at 1.17 mev and 1.33 mev .",
    "the highest activity for gammas at the muon spectrometer is recorded in the forward csc region  @xcite , with a flux which is below 1.8@xmath1610@xmath18@xmath2s@xmath3 . for 5 years of running hl - lhc ,",
    "we consider a factor 5 in luminosity increase , with a safety factor 3 the integrated gamma flux results to be 2.3@xmath1610@xmath19@xmath2 .",
    "the detector was placed at 50 cm from the source receiving an equivalent flux of 1.7@xmath1610@xmath20@xmath2s@xmath3 which should be uniformly distributed in the active area of the detector .",
    "thus , time required to reach the expected gamma flux integrated for 5 years of hl - lhc would be of 16 days in cocase .",
    "the detector was irradiated during 480 hours between march,22@xmath21 and april,11@xmath22 2011 .",
    "the integrated charge during this period was 1.48c at a mean mesh current of 858 na .",
    "figure [ gamma_current ] shows the evolution of the mesh current which fluctuates around the mean value within a 5% , variation which can be perfectly attributed to environmental effects .        the gain profile before and after exposure shows a reasonable reproducibility ( see figure  [ gamma_profile ] ) .",
    "fe peak energy resolution ) . ]",
    "after the completion of the above described exposures , the r17a and r17b prototypes were installed in the h6 cern - sps beam line .",
    "the beam consists of positively charged pions at 120gev / c in spills of about 10s every 48s .",
    "the beam intensity was typically 5@xmath2310@xmath18/spill over an area of 20mm@xmath1610 mm .",
    "the daq recorded around 800 events per spill .",
    "the intention of this last test was to determine any hint of ageing of the r17a by comparing the spatial resolution ( sr ) and efficiency obtained with respect to the reference detectors .",
    "the r17a and r17b were installed in the existing micromegas telescope line , as shown in figure  [ beam_setup ] . the micromegas telescope ( tmm2 , tmm3 , tmm5 , tmm6 ) is used as reference for the track reconstruction of the beam .",
    "the detectors under test were placed 2 m downstream of tmm6 .    .",
    "the line is shared with other detectors which were under test at the same time and have been excluded in this drawing for simplicity .",
    "our resistive prototypes were placed behind the telescope . ]",
    "the data were taken within two weeks at the end of october 2012 .",
    "three different regions were exposed to the beam in order to compare zones which received different types of radiations .",
    "we took data at each of these regions for several values of the amplification field by varying the mesh voltage , observing no significant difference between zones .",
    "figure  [ efficiency ] ( left ) shows the averaged sr as a function of the mesh voltage pointing to an optimum sr at about 550v , which corresponds to gains slightly above 10,000 .",
    "figure  [ efficiency ] ( right ) shows the detection efficiency of both detectors as a function of the absolute gain .",
    "the efficiencies were determined as the probability to detect one charge cluster when a track is found in each of the _ four _ telescope detectors .",
    "both detectors reach efficiencies of about 99.5% for the highest values of the gain , proving that there is no visible degradation effect in these measurements ( further details can be found at  @xcite ) .",
    "a 2d - readout resistive strip detector was tested to different intense irradiation sources : x - rays , high energy gammas , neutrons and alphas  @xcite . for each radiation type ,",
    "the total charge or interactions produced during the ageing process was well above the expected levels at the hl - lhc for 5 years of operation with an additional safety factor .",
    "in addition we investigate the performance of these detectors to the cern pion beam test facility .",
    "the results obtained are comparable to those obtained with a non - irradiated detector of same construction .",
    "we did not observe any degradation .",
    "the intense irradiation of r17a detector did not harm seriously the performance of the detector in terms of efficiency and sr , similar to the reference telescope .",
    "we present it as a definitive proof that irradiations of different nature , which will be present at the hl - lhc , do not affect this new technology .",
    "the values obtained for the spatial resolution and detection efficiency are reasonably good considering that the setup was not optimized to minimize the error on the track definition .",
