    "quantum systems under a periodically driving force are of great interest in varied fields of physics for its versatile applications in microscopic manipulations and control @xcite .",
    "its dynamics demonstrate many interesting behaviors , like dynamical localization and chaos - assisted tunneling , to name a few @xcite . among them , quantum resonance ( qr ) and anti - resonance ( ar ) are two interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "qr says that under a certain resonance condition , a particle acquires energy from an external force most efficiently leading to its energy increase with time in a square law . in the other limiting case , the ar case , the particle will bounce between two states and its energy shows a periodic oscillation .",
    "qr and ar are pure quantum behaviors without classical counterparts . in the well - known kicked rotor system , given a value of the kick strength @xmath2 , special resonant regimes of motion appear for periods with values @xmath3 , where the integers @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mutually prime . under these conditions",
    "the system regularly accumulates energy which grows quadratically in the time asymptotic @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath6 presents a completely periodic behavior with period @xmath7 .",
    "this is the ar case .",
    "qr and ar has been observed in the atom optics imitation of the quantum kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "recent realizations of the bec @xcite make us curious about whether or not qr and ar also exist in bec systems and how the non - linearity , stemming from mean field treatment of the atomic interaction @xcite , affects quantum resonances . recently in @xcite it has been shown that a bec in a quasi 1d box can be achieved .",
    "this experiment provides a good condition to investigate the quantum resonances of bec .",
    "the @xmath8 kick can be realized using counter propagating laser beams and its spatial shape can be adjusted by phase mismatch of laser beams .",
    "the interaction strength between atoms @xmath9 can be changed using a feshbach resonance .",
    "these motivate us to study the quantum resonances of bec under this experimental condition .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a bec trapped in a 1d box and kicked periodically , and study how the atomic interaction affects the quantum resonant behaviors .",
    "we find that the qr and ar conditions for this system are different from the quantum kicked rotor system . for this system",
    "the ar can be only found for a special spatial shape of the @xmath8 kick when @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath6 ) , for other shapes of kick and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the qr will be observed .",
    "because of the coherence of bec ,  for the ar case , the nonlinearity ( atom interaction ) causes the transition between oscillation and quantum beating ; for the qr case the energy increase is oscillating and the rate is dramatically affected by the many - body interaction .",
    "we also find that for the qr case the nonlinearity ( atom interaction ) suppress the sensitivity to the spatial shape of the kick .",
    "finally , we discuss the relation between the quantum resonant behavior and the kam or non - kam property of the corresponding classical system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model . in section iii , we show how the interaction between atoms in a bec changes the evolution of the energy in quantum resonant cases . in section",
    "iv we present our analytical results which show how the many - body interaction affects the evolution of the energy . in this section , we also show why for certain values of the parameter @xmath13 there is no ar and we show that this is not related to whether the corresponding classical system is kam or non - kam .",
    "finally , in section v , we present our conclusions .",
    "we focus our attention on the dynamics of a quasi-1d bec confined in a cigar shaped trap with a pulsating potential . in the limit of validity of the mean - field treatment , this system can be described by the dimensionless non - linear gpe :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 elsewhere , @xmath18 is the scaled strength of non - linear interaction , @xmath19 is the number of atoms , @xmath20 is the @xmath21-wave scattering length , @xmath22 is a coefficient which compensates for the loss of two dimensions @xcite , @xmath2 is the kick strength , @xmath23 represents @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the kick period , and @xmath26 denotes the position on the @xmath26 axis . the variable @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 is a parameter between @xmath29 and @xmath30 which can be controlled by the phase mismatch of laser beams . due to symmetries ,",
    "the only important interval for the parameter @xmath28 is @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "because the bec is unstable under kicks if the nonlinear interaction is large @xcite , we only study @xmath9 with a maximum value of @xmath32 .",
    "this value is very likely in the stable region where the number of condensed particles is much bigger than the number of non - condensed ones for a long enough time that we can use the gpe to study the evolution of the wave - function .    in the resonant case the energy grows in average quadratically and at the same time the number of non - condensed particle is also growing .",
    "this means that our results are valid for a limited number of kicks because after that we lose the coherence of the condensate .",
    "it could be interesting to see experimentally where this limit is.the energy of a particle is given by @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the evolution of the wave - function is given by numerical integration of eq.([eq : gp ] ) , over a certain number of kicks using the split - operator method .    in our study",
