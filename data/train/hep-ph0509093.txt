    "[ sec : intro ]    the flavor changing neutral current process is one of the most important field for testing the standard model ( sm ) at loop level and for establishing new physics beyond that .",
    "the rare @xmath3 decays provide a direct and reliable tool for extracting information about the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , such as , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 , if we know the value of the decay constant @xmath1 from other methods .",
    "conversely , we can determine the decay constant @xmath1 if the ckm matrix elements are known .",
    "pure leptonic decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are difficult to be measured in experiments , since helicity suppression give a very small branching ratio at order @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively @xcite . for @xmath8 meson case",
    "the situation gets even worse due to the smaller ckm matrix elements @xmath9 . for decay @xmath15 , although its branching ratio is about @xmath16 @xcite , it is still hard for experiments due to the low efficiency of @xmath17 lepton measurements .",
    "the @xmath18 decay is forbidden due to massless neutrino .",
    "fortunately , having an extra real photon emitted , the radiative leptonic decays can escape from the helicity suppression , so that larger branching ratio of @xmath0 is expected .",
    "a preliminary work of this type decay was carried out with many different approaches both in sm @xcite and beyond sm @xcite . in above work",
    ", it was shown that the diagrams with photon radiation from light quarks give the dominant contribution to the decay amplitude , that is inversely proportional to the constituent light quark mass .",
    "however the `` constituent quark mass '' is poorly understood . in this work ,",
    "we calculate the branching ratio using @xmath3 meson wave function which describes the constituent quark momentum distribution .",
    "the wave function has been studied for many years @xcite and used in calculating non - leptonic of @xmath3 decay @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach is also used to calculate radiative leptonic decay of charged @xmath3 meson @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we analyze the relevant effective hamiltonian for the @xmath0 decay . in section.[xxx ] , we give our analytical and numerical results , and then compare with other results . at last ,",
    "we summarize this work in section [ aaa ] .",
    "let us first look at the quark level process @xmath19 , with @xmath20 or @xmath21 , which is shown in fig .",
    "this is a flavor changing neutral current process , and both box and @xmath22 penguin contribute to this process .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in sm is given @xcite :    , with @xmath20 or @xmath21 . ]",
    "@xmath23    with @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath25 is @xmath26,\\ ] ] and @xmath27 . from this expression",
    ", we can see that the coefficient @xmath25 is sensitive to the mass of the particle in loop .",
    "if new particle exist , it should affect the wilson coefficient and change the branching ratio .",
    "that is why this kind of flavor changing neutral current processes is sensitive to new physics @xcite .",
    "we have already mentioned that the pure leptonic ( @xmath28 ) decay is forbidden due to helicity conservation . however ,",
    "when a photon is emitted from any charged line of @xmath29 or @xmath30 quark , this pure leptonic processes turn into radiative ones and helicity suppression does not exist anymore . at quark level the process @xmath31 is described by the same diagrams as @xmath32 shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "incidentally , we should note the following peculiarities of this process :     using effective four fermi operators . ]    * when photon emitted from internal charged particles ( w or top quark ) , the above mentioned process will be suppressed by a factor @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) , in comparison to the process @xmath34 , one can neglect the contribution of such diagrams . *",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath25 is the same for the processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 as a consequence of the extension of the low s low energy theorem ( for more detail see @xcite ) .",
    "so , when photon emitted from initial @xmath29 or light quark line , there are only two diagrams , contributing to the process @xmath37 . from fig.[fig2",
    "] , the corresponding decay amplitude turns out to be @xmath38 b ~(\\bar \\nu \\gamma ^\\mu p_l \\nu ) \\label{h4}.\\ ] ]",
    "in order to calculate analytic formulas of the decay amplitude , we use the wave functions @xmath39 decomposed in terms of spin structure . in the summation procedures ,",
    "the @xmath3 meson is treated as a heavy - light system .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 meson light - cone matrix element can be decomposed as @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is color degree of freedom , @xmath42 is the corresponding meson s momentum , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are lorentz scalar distribution amplitudes . as heavy quark effective",
    "theory leads to @xmath45 , then @xmath3 meson s wave function can be expressed by @xmath46\\gamma_{5\\alpha\\beta } \\phi_b(x).\\ ] ] in above function , the function @xmath47 describes the momentum distribution amplitude .",
    "since @xmath29 quark is much heavier than the light quark in @xmath3 meson , there is a sharp peak at the small @xmath48 region for the light quark momentum fraction , @xmath49 . \\label{phib}\\ ] ] it satisfies the normalization relation : @xmath50 with @xmath1 the @xmath3 meson decay constant .",
    "this choice of @xmath3 meson s wave function is almost a best fit from the @xmath3 meson non - leptonic two body decays @xcite .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider the b meson at rest and use the light - cone coordinate @xmath51 to describe the meson and quark s momenta , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "using these coordinate we can take the @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( momentum sum ) and photon s momenta as @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the momenta of @xmath29 and @xmath30 quark in b meson are @xmath58 , @xmath59 . using above convention",
    ", the amplitude for @xmath60 decay is written by : @xmath61 ( \\bar{\\nu_1 } \\gamma^\\mu p_l \\nu_2)\\ ] ] with @xmath62    after squaring the amplitude and performing the phase space integration over one of the two dalitz variables , and summing over three generation of neutrinos , we get the differential decay width versus the photon energy @xmath63 : @xmath64 with @xmath65 by integrating the variable @xmath63 , we get the decay width : @xmath66    in this work , we use following parameters @xcite : @xmath67 using these parameters , we get the branching ratios : @xmath68    just as we mentioned above , many approaches have been used to analyze these processes such as constituent quark model @xcite , pole model @xcite , qcd sum rule @xcite , and light front approach @xcite . here",
    "we compare our results with them which is shown in table .",
    "[ table ] .",
    ".comparison of results from different approaches [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    in constituent quark model , the non - relativity character is considered . if we replace our @xmath3 meson distribution amplitude in eq.([phib ] ) by a @xmath69 function @xmath70 , our formula will return back to the constituent quark model in ref.@xcite .",
    "since we have poor knowledge about quark mass up to now , our new calculation is surely an improvement . in paper @xcite",
    ", the authors also calculate these processes in the pole model , and the results are similar to the quark model case . from the table , one can also see that most of the methods get similar results except the qcd sum rule approach , whose result is larger than others .",
    "we hope the experiments in future can test these different methods .     versus the photon energy @xmath71 . ]    in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) , we figure out the differential decay rate of @xmath72 versus photon energy @xmath63 .",
    "we also display the photon energy spectrum from constituent quark model . from these figures ,",
    "we find our results are smaller than the constituent quark one , but the shape of the spectrum is the same . if normalized decay rate is used , the two lines will become only one , since the function is very simple @xmath73 which can be extracted from eq.([distribution ] ) .     versus the photon energy @xmath71 . ]",
    "of course , there are also uncertainties in our calculation .",
    "the most large uncertainty comes from the heavy meson wave function .",
    "the high order twists contribution , the high fock states are also not included , because they are not clear completely now .",
    "we hope that the non - leptonic @xmath3 meson decay can offer more information in the near future .",
    "in this work , we calculate the branching ratios in sm for @xmath74 to be @xmath7 and for @xmath75 to be @xmath6 using @xmath3 meson wave function constrained from non - leptonic b decays",
    ". these decay channels are useful to determine the decay constants @xmath1 and wave function . after calculation",
