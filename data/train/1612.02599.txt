    "this tell us that the stars do produce and release its @xmath0he into the interstellar medium .",
    "secondly , the @xmath0he@xmath1 line profile for all the three objects shows a double peaked shape .",
    "although the full width of the @xmath0he@xmath1 line is consistent with the optical expansion velocity , the profile differs from that of the recombination lines , peaking at the outermost velocities .",

    "both have double peaked profiles , similar to ic418 ( fig .",

    "whether helium in such a halo could be photo - ionized by the star is not clear .",
    "a double - peaked profile could arise from an expanding detached shell , which is larger than the beam of the telescope . in this case ,",
    "the outer components of the profile , which differ from the recombination lines , come from this large region , whilst the central part of the profile arises from the inner , ionized nebula .",
    "@xcite also proposed a contribution from a large , low density halo .",
    "the emission in the @xmath0he@xmath1 hyperfine line scales with @xmath19 ( column density ) , and that of recombination line with @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , a low density but high mass halo could explain the difference in profiles .",
    "the contribution of pne to the @xmath0he abundance is crucial for understanding the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the number density of @xmath0he@xmath1 atoms , @xmath21(@xmath0he@xmath1 ) , can be obtained by dividing the column density @xmath22(@xmath0he@xmath1 ) by the averaged optical path , @xmath23 , through the source . representing a pn as a homogeneous sphere of radius @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance , the optical path at angle from the centre @xmath26 is @xmath27 , and the optical path averaged over the source becomes @xmath28 . to calculate the fractional @xmath0he abundance we divide by the h@xmath1 density .",
    "figure [ abundances ] shows the @xmath0he abundances of the pn ic418 ( both purple crosses , taken from @xcite ) . for comparison the upper limits calculated from @xcite observations",
    "are presented using the red arrows .",

    "the curves for pop i ( light - blue line ) and ii ( red dashed - line ) show the standard abundance of @xmath0he taken from @xcite .",

    "the values observed in these objects proves that @xmath0he is produced at the centre of low - mass stars , and is ejected into the interstellar medium at the end of its life .",
    "however , the large amounts of @xmath0he produced in these models is at odds with the abundance of @xmath0he observed in the interstellar medium and the solar system",
    ". further research on other planetary nebulae will be needed to solve the @xmath0he problem , but as the emission is extremely weak and hard to detect , many observing hours are needed , or telescopes with higher sensitivity like the square kilometre array will be needed to do follow this research ."
