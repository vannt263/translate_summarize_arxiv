    "measurement is a process of transferring information from an object under investigation to the detector , be it a ruler , a radio telescope , or a human eye . for the measurement to be precise , the detector must be susceptible to small perturbations induced by the object .",

    "when the detector is large , i.e. , @xmath4 , this fundamental limitation plays a minor role compared to other aspects deteriorating the precision of the measurement .",
    "however , for systems involving only few particles or counting events , the snl becomes the major obstacle in the detection of small perturbations such as minuscule variations in the gravitational acceleration experienced by an ultra - cold coherent bose gas @xcite .    to improve beyond the snl",

    "quantum states can be more susceptible to perturbations than the classical ones and , in principle , the resolution @xmath5 can be achieved .",

    "we discuss a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) protocol @xcite involving an optical cavity mode interacting with a single atom .",
    "we demonstrate that this protocol yields a non - classical state of light @xcite that combined with a coherent pulse at the input of an optical interferometer can provide ssn sensitivity of the phase estimation .",
    "this result persists in the presence of realistic cavity losses and moderate imperfections of the photon counting at the output of the interferometer .",
