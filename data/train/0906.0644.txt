    "on the basis of the observational data [ 1 ] , cosmologists are in the firm ground to look beyond standard cosmology . instead of predicted deceleration in the present universe by standard cosmology , they have to consider the late cosmic acceleration .",
    "the main actor in this scenario is some exotic fluid , and its dominating influence in the very late universe . in newtonian mechanics ,",
    "such type of exotic fluids can not be formulated .",
    "its characteristic negative pressure @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the energy density , can be obtained from freidmann equations . in a very naive way",
    ", one can realise that since in the general relativistic picture , gravitation is thought to be the consequence of space - time curvature , differently curved space - time can generate also negative pressure .",
    "+ negative pressure requires the violation of the strong energy condition ( sec ) , @xmath2 .",
    "the very exotic fluid takes its popular name dark energy ( de ) due to its unknown character , and having gravitational effect [ 2 ] . on the contrary to that condition",
    ", @xmath3 implying @xmath4 with equation of state parmeter @xmath5 , caldwell showed the case @xmath6 better fit for the observed astrophysical data and preferred this case , which violates the dominant energy condition , @xmath7 as well [ 3 ] .",
    "in general , fluid of such characteristics is known as phantom . in spite of its better data - fitting ,",
    "phantom shows our incomplete understanding of the physics below @xmath8 [ 4 ] .",
    "one major issue , in this field that warrants further explanation is the thermodynamical behaviour of the fluid . +",
    "negative pressure leading to an accelerated universe can also be the characteristic of chaplygin gas .",
    "in addition to its exotic equation of state , it has some interesting features [ 5 ] .",
    "chaplygin gas equation of state is connected to string theory via a brane interpretation .",
    "moreover , it is reported that the chaplygin gas is the only gas known to admit a supersymmetric generalisation [ 6 ] . in course of the different evolving scenario ,",
    "chaplygin gas is also accordingly evolved .",
    "modified chaplygin gas is observed to interpolate between standard fluids at high energy densities and chaplygin gas fluids at low energy densities .",
    "its unifying character that unifies dark matter and dark enrgy is really interesting .",
    "modified chaplygin gas is represented by an exotic equation [ 7 ] + @xmath9 + in this paper , we consider the issue of generalised second law of gravitational thermodynamics in the context of modified chaplygin gas .",
    "if the expansion of the universe is dominated by phantom fluid , black holes are to loss their mass , and thus , are bound to disappear . as black holes are most entropic bodies in the universe , its disappearance causes the decrease of entropy of the universe . in a very elementary way",
    ", the answer becomes that it can not be according to the second law of thermodynamics [ 4 ] .",
    "but this negative approach has to be abandoned due to firm theoretical ground . assigning an entropy to the horizon size",
    ", the second law has to be generalised .",
    "according to gsl , the entropy of matter and fields inside the horizon plus the entropy of the event horizon can not decrease with time .",
    "thus + @xmath10    pollock and singh [ 8 ] , for the first time , considered this issue assuming the energy sources that violate the dominant energy condition . extending their work from various points , izquierdo and pav@xmath11n",
    "give some hints for further works , specially in a less idealised cosmology [ 9 ] .",
    "we shall follow these points in our work in the context of modified chaplygin gas .",

    "the relation of the entropy with energy and pressure of the fluid can be expressed in terms of gibb s equation    @xmath31    after some simplification , the expression becomes    @xmath32     + if the temperature of the event horizon is assumed as the temperature of the fluid i.e , @xmath33 , we have    @xmath34     +",
    "izquierdo and pav@xmath11n observed that in a less idealised cosmology , the presence of other forms of energy is to be considered . the validity of gsl is also not clear . among other things , the expression for the scale factor also should not be a simple one like @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "here , we have obtained the scale factor ( 3 ) following the whole dynamics and the equation of state of modified chaplygin gas , and really it is an involved expression . and",
    "for our concerned temperature , we have found from the expression ( 7 ) that phantom fluids , at least for @xmath37 , possess negative entropy if @xmath38 , and the entropy is positive if @xmath39 .",
