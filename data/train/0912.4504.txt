    "the existence of dark matter in our universe is nowadays a widely accepted fact .",
    "dark matter constitutes the dominant fraction of matter present in the universe . however , all the astrophysical evidences for dark matter , such as those coming from gravitational lensing , galaxy rotation curves and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , are purely gravitational  @xcite , and its particle nature remains unknown .",
    "the most popular type of dark matter ( dm ) candidate , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , can naturally reproduce the observed dm abundance due to effective self - annihilation in the early universe . today , this same annihilation process could produce an observable contribution to the measured cosmic - ray fluxes on earth  @xcite and have impact on cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "however , such an indirect detection of dm is also possible if dm _ decays _ at a sufficiently large rate .",
    "indeed , there exists a number of interesting and theoretically well motivated dm models that _ predict _ the decay of dm on cosmological time scales , namely with lifetimes around and above @xmath0 , which are typically required to be not in conflict with current observational limits  @xcite . among these candidates",
    "is the gravitino in small @xmath1-parity breaking scenarios ( motivated by requiring a consistent thermal history of the universe  @xcite ) and models of sterile neutrinos , whose long lifetime is due to tiny yukawa couplings ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other interesting models include kinetically mixed hidden gauge bosons and gauginos  @xcite . even in models where the dm candidate is stable in the first place",
    ", the consideration of higher - dimensional operators often renders the dm candidate particle unstable with cosmological lifetimes  @xcite .",
    "since the indirect detection signals from decay differ in general from the ones of annihilation , a dedicated study of decaying dm signals is warranted .    on the observational side ,",
    "recent results by several cosmic ray ( cr ) and @xmath2-ray experiments have seriously challenged the standard description and interpretation of the generation of high - energy cr electrons , positrons and @xmath2-rays , thus giving room also to dm interpretations . in particular , the pamela satellite reported the presence of an increase in the positron fraction @xmath3 above 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "if there is no primary source of cr positrons in the galaxy , and since secondary positrons originate from the interactions between cr nuclei ( mainly protons and helium ) and the interstellar gas , their spectrum on earth should be softer than the primary electron spectrum .",
    "therefore , the positron fraction is expected to decrease with increasing energy .",
    "the observed rise at high energy ( the so called positron fraction _ excess _ ) leads then to postulate the existence of an additional primary source of positrons with energies ranging from 10 to at least 100 gev .",
    "although considering more carefully standard astrophysical sources , such as pulsars , provides a possible explanation for this excess  @xcite , also dark matter interpretations are possible .",
    "in particular , dm decays might provide the required amount of primary positrons  @xcite .",
    "however , we should stress that the requirement of an additional primary positron source is not strictly necessary to interpret the data .",
    "the positron excess can be interpreted also as due to propagation effects , either in the standard sources or in the ism .",
    "for example , the excess could be due to inhomogeneities of cr sources  @xcite , or it could be a consequence of reacceleration of secondary cosmic rays in supernova remnants  @xcite . also an increase of starlight and interstellar gas densities could reproduce the positron excess  @xcite .",
    "lastly , also nested leaky box models can in principle provide a good fit to the positron fraction  @xcite .",
    "apart from the positron fraction , also    the @xmath4 spectra from the fermi lat measurement  @xcite and hess  @xcite are intriguing .",
    "the fermi lat instrument measured a total @xmath5 spectrum at high energies from 20 gev to 1 tev on earth significantly harder than expected according to propagation models , and with a hint of the presence of a broad bump at a few hundred gev , which is smoothly connected with hess observations around the tev ( see , e.g.  @xcite for a review of possible interpretations of these observations ) .",
    "this also provides a motivation to explain the excess using decaying dark matter which can easily produce large numbers of energetic positrons and electrons .",
    "both these striking observations have motivated a plethora of works on both building and constraining new dark matter models .",
    "high energy cr electrons and positrons produce @xmath2-rays through the processes of inverse compton scattering ( ics ) off low energy photons in the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and through bremsstrahlung emission due to the interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope is currently observing the @xmath2-ray sky in the energy range between 30 mev and 300 gev with unprecedented angular resolution and precise energy sensitivity .",
    "data obtained during the first year of operation of fermi are about to be released officially , and preliminary data on the @xmath2-ray spectrum in some regions of the sky were already made public in several conferences .",
    "it is then timely to provide tools to exploit this detailed information in an efficient way .    at present ,",
    "most attempts to construct dark matter candidates as the interpretation of the pamela and @xmath2-ray data are inevitably model dependent .",
    "thus , it is useful to develop model independent analysis tools such as response functions .",
    "these are functions of injected electron or positron energy which are obtained from comparing the @xmath2-ray spectrum resulting on earth after propagation ( which we call signal ) with the observed @xmath2-ray spectrum ( which henceforth will be called background ) .",
    "indeed , this method has already been used to constrain decaying dm scenarios with the observed galactic synchrotron radiation maps  @xcite .",
    "since the propagation equation is linear in the source term , each injected electron energy evolves independently .",
    "therefore , with a finite number of numerical simulations at different injection energies we can construct a numerical @xmath6-response function of signal - to - background .",
    "the @xmath6-response function encodes our knowledge about the propagation of cr electrons in the galaxy , as well as about the distribution of dm , but is independent of the particle physics model leading to the actual spectra of electrons and positrons after dm decay . moreover , the @xmath6-response functions we compute in this work are normalized to the present @xmath2-ray data .",
    "hence , constraints can be obtained by the convolution of the @xmath6-response functions with a given dm decay spectrum and requiring that the result be smaller than the product of dm mass and lifetime in suitable units . if this condition is violated , the dm model predicts @xmath2-ray fluxes ( from ics and bremsstrahlung ) that are higher than the data by at least @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to @xmath2-rays produced by ics and bremsstrahlung of pairs resulting from dm decay , the prompt radiation of @xmath2-rays during the dm decay can be a very relevant signature of dm decays .",
    "however , since prompt radiation depends on the particle physics , we can not include it in our @xmath6-response functions and has to be included by hand when pursuing constraints on a specific model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we describe our method of @xmath6-response functions to provide constrains on any dark matter model involving electrons and positrons in its decay products . in sect .",
    "3 we present the @xmath6-response functions based on the fermi data and discuss how they are improved by the removal of astrophysical contributions of known origin to the @xmath8ray signal . in sect .",
    "4 we apply our @xmath6-response functions to some specific dark matter decay scenarios and compare it to the contribution of prompt radiation to the @xmath8ray constraints . finally , in set .",
    "5 we present our final discussions and summarize .",
    "in this section we will discuss the different sources of gamma radiation resulting from dark matter decay .",
    "generically , @xmath2-rays are expected as a secondary product of the interactions of crs with the galactic gas and radiation field .",
    "it is well known that crs in the energy range we are interested in obey the following propagation equation ( ginzburg & syrovatskii  @xcite ) @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the number density of the electrons / positrons ; @xmath11 is their momentum ; @xmath12 their velocity in units of the speed of light @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the production cross section of electrons / positrons from spallation of cr protons and heavier nuclei with density @xmath15 onto the ism gas , whose density is @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the spatial diffusion coefficient which is a function of the particle rigidity @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the convection velocity ; @xmath20 are continuous energy losses , whose relevant timescales @xmath21 are shown in fig .",

    "finally , @xmath25 represents the primary injection term .",
    "the electron distribution can be computed numerically in the stationary limit @xmath26 by using the methods of  @xcite . however , for this paper we have used our own propagation codes , which have strongly improved convergence behavior for mono - energetic injection spectra . from this distribution",
    "we will then compute the @xmath2-ray spectra and maps produced by ics and bremsstrahlung .",
    "we will firstly discuss inverse compton scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation , and secondly prompt radiation , both with their galactic and extragalactic contributions , with particular emphasis on the related uncertainties .",
    "electrons and positrons produced in the decay of dark matter give rise to a @xmath2-ray signal , coming from the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of low energy photons of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "a further , mostly subdominant , contribution to the @xmath2-ray flux comes from bremsstrahlung of the electrons and positrons when scattering with the galactic gas . in the context of the pamela positron excess ,",

    "the second term , @xmath45 , stems from the bremsstrahlung emission due to deflection of relativistic electrons and positrons in the electrostatic potential of interstellar gas atoms and molecules .",

    "although the main aim of @xcite was not to find a best fit model able to reproduce all the observed spectra , it is remarkable that the diffusion parameters determined via an high energy analysis are able to describe data down to energies of the order of 1 gev/ nucleon , and also to reproduce with reasonable accuracy the pamela measurements of the antiproton flux .",
    "it must be noticed , however , that this is only one out of many different possible models in agreement with nuclei cr observations ( also simple leaky - box models can in fact succeed in reproducing high energy data @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ( adopting the `` fast evolution '' model ) .    another contribution to the ics radiation comes from electrons and positrons produced in the dark matter decay inside of our dark matter halo , but outside of the diffusion zone .",
    "if these particles are far enough from the galactic disk region , beyond a few kpc , their main energy loss channel is scattering with the cmb .",

    "the corresponding uncertainties can reach one order of magnitude .",
    "as we already noticed , the height @xmath63 is only poorly known since its determination is degenerate with the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the most widely adopted range of variation of @xmath63 is between 1 and 15 kpc , based on the poor quality data on @xmath64be/@xmath50be . due to this uncertainty",
    "it is hard to obtain any definitive constraint on , _",
    "e.g. _ , the supersymmetric parameter space of dm based on current anti - proton data  @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming ams-02 experiment @xcite will however provide very accurate data on unstable / stable ratios ( as well as for b / c and other stable secondary / primary ratios ) , which might allow a more precise determination of the diffusion height scale @xmath63 .    in our case",
    "it is clear that a larger height of the diffusion zone leads to more dm decays contributing to the @xmath2-ray flux , because more electrons of dm origin are confined in the diffusive region .",
    "uncertainties on other cr propagation parameters , such as the alfvn velocity @xmath65 and the convection velocity @xmath66 , are less relevant in affecting the electron distribution of dm , and especially affect only the electrons below around 10 gev since higher energy electrons lose energy too rapidly via ics and can not propagate over long distances .",
    "we found that the full - sky ics @xmath8ray emission induced by very high energy electrons from dm decay obtained in the l1 model is comparable with the one obtained using other widely known models , namely dc and dr  @xcite which adopt the same height of the diffusion zone as our l1 model .",
    "another source of uncertainty comes from the dependence of the @xmath2-ray emission on the halo profiles .",
    "we compared the fluxes predicted for different halo models ( with parameters as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and found that for shallower halo profiles such as the kra  @xcite and the isothermal  @xcite profile the @xmath2-ray emission is reduced by around 10% . on the other hand , in case of the einasto profile ( see @xcite and references therein ) the flux is enhanced by 30% .",
    "since this variation is subdominant when compared with the uncertainties of the propagation models , we will simply adopt the nfw halo profile in the rest of the present work .",
    "the @xmath2-ray emission also depends on the galactic magnetic field , since synchrotron losses can be of the order of ics radiation losses at high electron energies .",
    "the magnetic field profile close to the galactic center is quite uncertain and could be considerably higher than a few @xmath67  @xcite . in this paper , we adopt the field from ref .",
    "@xcite which matches the 408 mhz synchrotron distribution .",

    "@xcite which is based on a large - scale data set on starlight polarization .",
    "although this work focuses on ics radiation produced by electrons and positrons from decaying dark matter , we can not overlook the fact that the prompt radiation of gamma rays can be a very competitive signature of dark matter decays . indeed , in many realistic cases it turns out that this component can be larger than the ics and therefore it can actually give the strongest constraints .    prompt radiation from dark matter decay is produced more frequently inside our overdense galactic dark matter halo - ray background , see ref .",
    "] but it is also produced at cosmological distances . at energies around @xmath68 or below ,",
    "the magnitude of the halo and extragalactic fluxes are of the same order when looking in direction of the anti - galactic center , whereas at higher energies around and above @xmath69 the inelastic scattering between @xmath2 rays and the ibl reduces the extragalactic component significantly and can _ not _ be neglected .",

    "<S> this possibility is inevitably related with the dark matter interpretation of the observed pamela and fermi excesses . the aim of this paper is providing a simple and universal method to constraint dark matter models which produce electrons and positrons in their decay by using the fermi lat gamma - ray observations in the energy range between 0.5 gev and 300 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a set of universal response functions that , once convolved with a specific dark matter model produce the desired constraint . </S>",

    "<S> we study the uncertainties in the determination of the response functions and apply them to place constraints on some specific dark matter decay models that can well fit the positron and electron fluxes observed by pamela and fermi lat . to this end </S>",
