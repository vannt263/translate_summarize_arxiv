    "dileptons , i.e. correlated electron and positron or @xmath4 pairs , are one of the key observables in experiments for ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions since they are emitted during the whole evolution of a collision and interact only electromagnetically and thus very weakly with the strongly interacting partonic or hadronic medium created in the collisions . also , dileptons of different invariant masses are dominantly produced from different stages of a relativistic nuclear collision , and this provides the possibility to probe the properties of the produced hot and dense matter at various conditions by measuring the differential dilepton spectra .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons can be roughly divided into 3 different regions which are dominated by different physics . in the low mass region ( @xmath5 1 gev ) , the radiation is dominated by the decays of light mesons ( consisting of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( anti)quarks ) , while in the intermediate mass region ( 1 gev @xmath9 3 gev ) , the dominant hadronic contribution to the invariant mass spectrum stems from the decays of open charm mesons . above the @xmath10 peak ,",
    "the dilepton spectrum is first dominated by open beauty decays and then by the initial state drell - yan radiation . besides these sources of dileptons , the radiation from the strongly interacting quark - gluon - plasma ( sqgp )  @xcite as well as some other more exotic sources like simultaneous interactions of four pions  @xcite can also give significant contributions , particularly in the intermediate mass region .",
    "these partonic and hadronic channels have been studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite at top super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) and relativistic - heavy - ion - collider ( rhic ) energies , and it has been found that the partonic channels clearly dominate over multi - pion sources in the intermediate dilepton mass regime .    in the present study , we include all known ( leading ) dilepton sources to study and compare the magnitude of the radiation from the qgp with that from other ( conventional ) sources in heavy ion collisions at the large - hadron - collider ( lhc ) energies . since at present there is no single model that could address reliably all of the above - mentioned sources for dilpeton production , we thus employ in this analysis different approaches to evaluate the invariant mass spectrum from the different sources . specifically , we concentrate on two models ( and their extensions ) : the parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd ) approach  @xcite and the extended statistical hadronization model ( shm )  @xcite .",
    "the phsd model is a relativistic transport approach developed , tested and well suited for studying dynamical partonic and hadronic systems in heavy ion collisions from low to ultra - relativistic energies of @xmath11=200 gev , while the shm is a statistical hadronic model suitable for describing in detail the relative yields of final state hadrons .    in the case of proton - proton ( @xmath12 ) collisions , they are dominated by the creation and decays of various hadrons , and the shm should be a suitable model for estimating the hadronic freeze - out cocktail contribution to dileptons .",
    "indeed , this was confirmed by our simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite for p+p collisions at @xmath11= 200 gev . on the contrary , in heavy - ion collisions a rather long - living strongly interacting dynamical fireball is formed and dileptons are emitted from the created charges over an extended period of time . for such systems",
    "the shm might not provide a good description because the properties , i.e. the masses and widths , of hadrons might change in the hot and dense nuclear environment as a function of time , which can not be taken into account in the shm .",
    "additionally , the dilepton signal from the qgp during the early reaction phase is expected to outshine the background radiation due to the cocktail of hadron decays . for this purpose",
    ", we will employ the phsd transport approach which can account for the medium - dependent properties of partons and hadrons and their multiple interactions as well as for the dynamical evolution of the system in general , including the transition to the partonic phase and the radiation from the sqgp .",
    "we note that a direct comparison between results from the phsd and the shm has shown that the low mass ( @xmath13  gev ) spectra of @xmath14 -pairs in @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions at = 200 gev deviate from each other by only up to 20%  @xcite , i.e. either the time - evolution of the system plays only a minor role in the dilepton emission or the subsequent hadronic evolution to a large extent washes out the details of the dynamics in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
    "we will study this issue again in detail in the first part of present study and compare explicitly our results from both the static and dynamical model in order to constrain the dilepton yield from known hadronic sources .",
    "we will then proceed to our main goal , i.e. the identification of the qgp signal from the spectrum of dileptons produced in @xmath16 collisions in the lhc energy regime .    in the following section ( sect .  [ section_phsd ] )",
    ", we will briefly recall the main concepts of the phsd transport approach and list the partonic and hadronic sources of dileptons in phsd .",

    "we then continue with results from the shm as well as from the dynamical calculations of pb+pb collisions within the phsd .",
    "furthermore , the effect of in - medium modifications of vector mesons on the low - mass dilepton spectrum at @xmath11=2.76 tev is investigated .",
    "finally , the influence of a transverse momentum cut on the dilepton spectrum as a possible way to enhance the qgp signal is explored .",

    "[ sectionsummary ] with a summary of our findings and a discussion of open problems .",
    "the phsd model  @xcite is an off - shell transport model that consistently describes the full evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision from the initial hard scatterings and string formation through the dynamical deconfinement phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma as well as hadronization and to the subsequent interactions in the hadronic phase . in the hadronic sector ,",
    "the phsd is equivalent to the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach  @xcite that has been used for the description of @xmath19 and @xmath20 collisions from sis to rhic energies and has led to a fair reproduction of measured hadron abundances , rapidity distributions and transverse momentum spectra . in particular , as in the hsd , the phsd incorporates off - shell dynamics for vector mesons  @xcite and a set of vector - meson spectral functions  @xcite that covers possible scenarios for their in - medium modifications . in phsd the transition from the partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark - antiquark pairs to mesonic resonances or three quarks ( antiquarks ) to baryonic states , i.e. , by the dynamical hadronization @xcite . note that due to the off - shell nature of both partons and hadrons",
    ", the hadronization process obeys all conservation laws ( i.e. , the 4-momentum conservation and the flavor current conservation ) in each event , the detailed balance relations , and the increase in the total entropy @xmath21 .",
    "the transport theoretical description of quarks and gluons in the phsd is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) for partons that is constructed to reproduce the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) results for a quark - gluon plasma in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the dqpm provides the mean - fields for gluons / quarks and their effective 2-body interactions that are implemented in the phsd . for details about the dqpm model and the off - shell transport ,",
    "we refer the reader to the review in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we stress that a non - vanishing width in the partonic spectral functions is the main difference between the dqpm and conventional quasiparticle models  @xcite .",
    "its influence on the collision dynamics can be seen in the correlation functions , which , in the stationary limit involve the off - diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath22 and thus give rise to the shear viscosity @xmath23 of the medium  @xcite .",
    "a sizable width is then essential for obtaining a small ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath24 , which results in a roughly hydrodynamical evolution of the partonic system in phsd @xcite .",
    "the two - particle correlations resulting from the finite width of the parton spectral functions are taken into account dynamically in the phsd by means of the _ generalized _ off - shell transport equations  @xcite that go beyond the mean field or boltzmann approximation  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the phsd approach has been tested from low sps to top rhic energies against the measured rapidity spectra of various particle species , transverse mass distributions , differential elliptic flow of charged hadrons as well as their quark - number scaling  @xcite .",
    "more recently , higher harmonics in the azimuthal distribution of charged hadrons in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction has also been examined  @xcite .",

    "a similar observation has also been made in ref .",

    "in addition to the virtualities of the partons involved , the latter also depends on the energy density in the local cell , where the collision takes place , as according to the dqpm it governs the widths of the quark and gluon spectral functions as well as the strong coupling .      in the hadronic sector ,",

    "in contrast to the hsd approach  without explicit partonic degrees of freedom  the mesons in the phsd are produced through the dynamical hadronization from the partonic state . on the other hand ,",

    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the phsd has been extended to include hadronic sources for dilepton production from secondary multi - meson interactions through the channels @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "these so - called ` 4@xmath31 channels ' for dilepton production are incorporated in the phsd on a microscopic level rather than assuming thermal dilepton production rates and a parametrization for the inverse reaction @xmath43 is incorporated by employing the detailed balance as in refs .",
    "@xcite . by studying the electromagnetic emissivity ( in the dilepton channel ) of the hot hadron gas",

    "@xcite that the dominating hadronic reactions contributing to the dilepton yield at the invariant masses above the @xmath39 peak are the two - body reactions of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "this conclusion was supported by the subsequent study in a hadronic relativistic transport model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we implemented the above listed two - meson dilepton production channels in the phsd approach in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some higher vector mesons ( @xmath48 _ etc .",
    "_ ) were tacitly included by using phenomenological form factors that are adjusted to the experimental data . specifically , we determined the cross sections for the mesonic interactions with dileptons in the final state using an effective lagrangian approach following the works of refs .",

    "contributions of these channels to the dilepton invariant mass spectrum in nucleus - nucleus collisions at top sps and rhic energies and comparisons to available data have been reported in refs .",
    "dilepton production has also been studied in the framework of the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) at sps  @xcite and rhic energies  @xcite . even in the absence of a dynamical evolution of the fireball",

    "we extend the previous studies to lhc energies in order to model in detail the contribution of dileptons stemming from the so - called `` freeze - out cocktail '' .",
    "these results can then be compared with our transport simulations in order to quantify the effects from partonic degrees of freedom and the dynamical evolution of the produced hot and dense matter .",
    "the shm is a suitable reference model for obtaining additional dynamical information about the collisions besides the particle spectra at chemical freeze - out .",
    "a corresponding comparison for dilepton spectra from @xmath55 collisions at the top rhic energy was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we aim at a similar comparison for @xmath16 collisions at lhc energies which requires to specify the intrinsic parameters of the statistical hadronization model . since the central rapidity region is , to a good approximation , net charge free in heavy ion collisions at the lhc energies , we set all chemical potentials to zero in this analysis .",
    "based on findings at sps and rhic , we expect the @xmath56 ( strangeness suppression ) factor to be close to unity in central @xmath16 collisions at lhc energies .",
    "this was recently confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite where measurements of ratios of hadronic rapidity densities were compared with statistical model predictions  @xcite evaluated with the thermal parameter @xmath57mev and @xmath56=1 .",
    "all ratios of kaons and multi - strange hyperons to pions were correctly predicted , indicating that strangeness is indeed chemically equilibrated ( i.e. @xmath58 ) in central @xmath16 collisions at the lhc energies .",
    "therefore , the thermal state of the produced fireball can be specified with two free parameters : the temperature @xmath59 and volume @xmath60 .",
    "we do not attempt to extract the chemical freeze - out temperature from the data but use the predicted asymptotic value of @xmath59=170 mev  @xcite instead .",
    "the overall normalization is determined from the measured transverse momentum spectra of various hadrons ( see below ) .",
    "the shm - describing a static single fireball - is rather reliable in predicting the phase - space integrated relative yields of different hadrons .",
    "however , since experiments measure electrons and positrons at mid - rapidity only and above some minimum transverse momentum , we need to emulate the initial state dynamics such that the detector acceptance is correctly accounted for .    the alice collaboration has measured the transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the 0 - 5% most central pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev  @xcite while @xmath64 and @xmath65 spectra are measured in the 0 - 20% most central collisions .",
    "we can estimate the multi - strange hyperon rapidity densities in the 0 - 5% most central collisions with help of the combined alice and cms measurement of charged hadron rapidity density as a function of centrality ( see figure 5 of  @xcite ) .",
    "fitting the above - mentioned charged hadron data by a second - order polynomial , we obtain the following scaling factor : @xmath66 by which we multiply the hyperon transverse momentum spectra in the 0 - 20% most central collisions in order to estimate the corresponding spectra in the 0 - 5% most central collisions .",
    "we then assume that the hadron yield in @xmath16 collisions arises as a superposition of @xmath67  independent nucleon - nucleon collisions and determine the average elementary volume @xmath68 @xmath69 such that our pion yield , which scale like @xmath70@xmath71 , agree with the measured pion yield in central @xmath16 collisions .",
    "we further take = 383  independent nucleon - nucleon collisions for each 0 - 5% most central @xmath16 collision .",
    "the total mass @xmath72 of the hadron cluster in the fireball can be calculated by adding the energies of individual hadrons . from the equipartition theorem for a system in thermal equilibrium that energy is shared equally among its degrees of freedom , we can assume that the `` thermal '' momentum of the cluster @xmath73 equals on average to the mass of the cluster .",
    "since the longitudinal direction is dominantly governed by the initial state parton dynamics , we only apply this to the cluster s transverse momentum , i.e. , its average transverse momentum is @xmath74 . in each event , we thus first calculate @xmath72 and sample a gaussian distribution for the cluster s transverse momentum such that the mean value of the gaussian equals to @xmath75 while the width of the distribution is taken as @xmath76 .    for the distribution of the longitudinal momentum of the cluster , we rely here on the simple landau scaling , which is in fair agreement with the measurements at least up to the rhic energies , for a discussion , see e.g. ref .  @xcite . according to the landau scaling , the width of the rapidity distribution of pions can be estimated from the simple formula @xmath77 leading to @xmath78(2.76tev)=7.26 which we take as the width of the clusters rapidity distribution in our calculations .",
    "we note that in our previous work at the rhic energies , we have fitted the width of the clusters rapidity distribution with the value @xmath78(200gev)=4.2 which is in fair agreement with the value @xmath78(200gev)=4.7 obtained from the landau scaling .",

    "we have omitted here the transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath63 as it is not in agreement with that measured in experiments .",

    "the form factors for dilepton decays of the light hadrons employed here are the same as in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "since the low - mass dilepton spectrum is strongly dominated by hadronic decay channels , the shm already allows us to evaluate the @xmath81 pair spectrum from the different hadronic decays , i.e. the usual hadronic cocktail. on the other hand , above invariant masses of about 1 gev the dominant hadronic channels for dileptons are the correlated and un - correlated semi - leptonic decays of open charm and open beauty mesons , whose _ relative populations _ are modeled within the extended shm while the total open charm and beauty cross sections are taken from elementary p+p collisions at the same bombarding energy and scaled with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( see below ) .",
