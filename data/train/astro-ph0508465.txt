    "one of the keys to understanding the origin of cosmic - rays is the spectral shape of the transition from galactic cosmic - rays to extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "the galactic origin of low - energy crs is generally accepted , while the highest energy crs ( above @xmath5  ev ) are no longer confined by galactic magnetic fields and most probably originate from other galaxies .",
    "thus , a transition between the two components has to occur in some energy range .",
    "the most natural location for this transition is around @xmath6  ev at a feature in the cr spectrum known as the _ ankle_. this is the only energy range where the spectrum gets harder ( i.e. , its logarithmic slope gets smaller ) , offering a simple transition scheme to a harder cr component which is subdominant at lower energies .",
    "a different conclusion has recently been proposed on the basis of composition results from the hires collaboration , tentatively showing a transition from heavy to light primary nuclei at an energy around @xmath7  ev @xcite , which can be identified with a _",
    "second knee _ feature in the spectrum .",
    "such composition measurements rely on statistical determinations of the elongation rate of extensive air - showers and depend on shower development simulations which are still quite uncertain . in this case",
    "the ankle is interpreted as an e@xmath8-e@xmath9 pair - production dip @xcite resulting from proton propagation over large distances in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the transition from gcr to ecgr _ does not have _ to be at the ankle . for these second - knee - transition models",
    "the egcr component is best fitted by assuming a power - law source spectrum in @xmath10 with @xmath11 @xcite or @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , assume that egcrs are only protons .    in this study",
    ", we investigate how these conclusions are modified when nuclei heavier than protons are also present in the source .",
    "we apply the revised scheme of photo - nuclear interactions described in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that the two main aspects of egcr phenomenology are jointly affected , namely the best fit slope of the source spectrum and the interpretation of the ankle .",
    "the interpretation of the ankle as a pair production dip is not viable in the mixed composition case , unless the fraction of protons is above 85% . when reasonable assumptions for the fraction of nuclei in the egcr are introduced , the traditional interpretation of a gcr / egcr transition at the ankle is recovered and the best fit spectral index for egcr is @xmath13 2.2  2.3 , as expected from relativistic shock acceleration .",
    "finally , the best fit egcr spectrum occurs when both the gcr and egcr component have the same spectral index , allowing for holistic approaches to the cr spectrum .",
    "although extragalactic magnetic fields could modify the uhecr spectrum , we assume here that their intensity is low enough to be negligible and focus on a comparison between pure proton and mixed - composition models .",
    "the choice of a source composition is arbitrary in the absence of a source model , but we consider a `` generic composition '' assuming that egcrs have the same relative source abundances as the best known , low - energy gcrs , derived from _",
    "ulysses _ and _ heao 3 _ data @xcite .",
    "we convert the differential abundance ratios , @xmath14 , at a given energy per nucleon ( @xmath15 ) into ratios at a given energy , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the spectral index , so that the gcr source spectrum is : @xmath18 .",
    "since our goal is also to investigate the viability of the proton pair production dip as an explaination for the ankle when heavier nuclei are emited at the sources we will as well consider proton dominated compositions with small fraction of heavier nuclei .",
    "we will study in particular the impact of small fractions of helium and iron nuclei .    finally , we choose a rigidity dependent maximum energy at the source for the various nuclear species @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that energy losses and photo - fragmentation inside the source can be neglected , so that all nuclei with the same gyroradius behave the same way .",
    "this implies @xmath20 .",
    "+     we compute the propagated spectrum of egcrs for a uniform source distribution with negligible magnetic fields , using a monte - carlo technique . for this purpose",
    "we take into account all the relevant energy loss processes for protons and nuclei . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]a , we show the resulting propagated spectra obtained with the prescription described above where @xmath21  ev . the error bars represent the 1-@xmath22 fluctuations of the flux in each energy bin , as expected for a data set with the statistics of the agasa experiment , i.e. , 866 events above @xmath23  ev @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with the data from hires and agasa experiments . in the pure proton case ,",
    "we find again that the best fit spectrum has @xmath24 and a pair production dip , as in previous work .",
    "figures  [ fig : spectra]b and  [ fig : spectra]c show how the spectrum around the ankle and the gzk bump evolves with the fraction of protons in the source composition ( above @xmath25  ev ) for two composition hypothesis .",
    "when the remaining composition is dominated by helium , for fractions lower than 75% , the pair production dip is strongly attenuated and the ankle is actually reversed for fractions lower than @xmath26% .",
    "when small fraction of iron nuclei are present , the proton pair production dip is also modified but in a different way ( due to the difference in the energy losses between he and fe @xcite ) the extragalactic spectrum appears flatter below @xmath27  ev and a galactic component is then needed to reproduce the low energy part of the ankle .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of the ankle as an e@xmath8-e@xmath9 pair production dip requires a very large fraction of protons at the source .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra]a shows two good fits to the highest energy data using mixed composition models with @xmath28 or 2.3 , corresponding to 50% or 40% protons at the source , respectively .    the pure proton model with @xmath24 provides a good fit to the data down to @xmath29  ev ( assuming a uniform source distribution and no magnetic field ) , the transition from gcr to egcr should occur before the ankle . however , shock acceleration processes are known to yield a spectrum with @xmath302.3 . as",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]a , such spectral indexes can provide equally good fits to the high energy data , assuming a realistic source model with a mixed composition . in such a scenario ,",
    "the transition from gcrs to egcrs occurs at the ankle , which thus keeps its `` standard '' interpretation .",
    "in addition , injection spectrum @xmath31 has also been considered as the best fit to the low - energy data for the gcr component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus particularly interesting to note that assuming a similar composition for both the gcr and egcr components is precisely what also makes a similar source spectrum possible .",
    "in addition , it has been shown in @xcite that a source power - law index of @xmath32 is a necessary condition for holistic models , in which the same sources produce the crs at all energies .",
    "the results presented here show that a self - consistent model can be built for crs with a similar composition and spectrum at all energies provided the gcr / egcr transition is at the ankle .",
    "furthermore , we also calculated the expected cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for the pure proton and mixed model @xcite . for both cases we found very similar high energy neutrino peaks .",
    "this can be understood easily since protons dominate the high energy spectrum in the mixed case .",
    "we can then conclude for both composition hypothesis high energy neutrino fluxes should be detectable with experiments like auger or anita , but these fluxes could certainly not be used to distinguish between the two models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]d , we show the predicted elongation rates for the composition hypothesis of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]a , according to 10000 aires @xcite simulated showers of the most abundant species @xcite ( i.e , h , he , cno , mg , si , fe ) between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ev . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the galactic iron component above @xmath3 ev is the difference between the predicted extragalactic component and the experimental data . in the case of the pure proton extragalactic component",
    ", a very steep elongation rate is expected between @xmath3 and @xmath25 ev in very good agreement with hires data @xcite . as it is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]b and [ fig : spectra]c , since the proton fraction as to be very high in the case of a second knee transition model ( i.e a dip due to pair production ) , the elongation rate is expected to a have the characteristic shape of a rapid transition from a heavy galactic composition ( shown by kascade results @xcite ) to a very light extragalactic component unavoidably close to a pure proton expectation . above @xmath25",
    "ev the expected elongation depend strongly on the hadronic models , the consistency of hires data with this scenario is thus diffucult to establish , one can at least notice that the pure proton case is within the @xmath33  g.@xmath34 hires systematic error and the transition is in the expected energy range .",
    "for the mixed composition a continuous transition , from galactic iron to mixed composition ( with a flattening between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ev ) and finally above @xmath37 ev almost pure proton , is expected .",
    "this predicted shape is in good agreement ( especially for the sibyll model ) with fly s eye and also yakutsk results @xcite except below @xmath25 ev where the exact composition of the galactic component becomes relevant .",
    "although the predictions are hadronic model dependant , the expected elongation rates appear extremely different whatever the detail of the astrophysical hypothesis @xcite for the two transition models ( i.e second knee or ankle ) .",
    "the current disagreements between different experimental results do not allow a conclusion at this point since each model can be favored or as well almost ruled out , whether one trusts hires or fly s eye elongation rate .",
    "however , the pierre auger observatory should distinguish between the two hypothesis with high statistics and high accuracy hybrid elongation rate and finally explain the origin of the ankle ."
