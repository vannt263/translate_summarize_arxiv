    "crucial to any interpretation of the nature and origin of kjpn  8 is sound knowledge of its distance , d. this has been given as d @xmath9 1600 @xmath1  230 pc by meaburn ( 1997  paper i ) from measurements of the expansion proper motion ( epm ) of the a1 & a2 outflow .",

    "this new h@xmath0[n  ii ]  image has not only permitted more detailed and accurate measurents of the epms of the a1 & a2 outflow , but has also led to the determination of their hitherto unknown values for the b2 and c1 features .",

    "any confusing star images have now been positively identified by taking a complimentary image in the adjacent red continumm light devoid of emission lines .",
    "furthermore , the tilt of the a1 & a2 outflow to the plane of the sky has now been estimated more certainly than in paper i. when combined with this outflow s measured radial velocity a more rigorous outflow tangential velocity , crucial to the determination of d from the measured epms , has now been obtained . in the present paper , because the measured @xcite expansion velocity of the principal lobes is @xmath4 300 , it is assumed that collisional ionization by hypersonic shocks must generate the optical emission lines .",
    "the high  speed knots and filaments that constitute these lobes have therefore been ejected from the central source .",
    "any complication to the present measurements of the epms caused by any radiative ionization by lyman photons from the central stellar system must be neglible , for bright rims associated with such ionization fronts would only propagate into the ejected material at the sound speed of @xmath4 10 .",

    "an example of this comparison for knot a1b is shown in figs [ fig5]a &  b. only one position for knot b2 was measured in a similar way ( figs .",

    ",  6584  nebular emission lines dominate all others in both observations with intensities relative to each other in the a1 lobe of 855 , 1598 and 528 respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the broader wavelength range ( @xmath4 800  ) of the possi - r observation also transmits the [ sii ]  6716 , 6731   nebular lines whose relative intensities are 548 and 410 respectively .",
    "this causes neglible problems in this comparison for the sensitivity of the kodak 103a - e falls off rapidly towards the red : it is around 40 times less sensitive at 6730   than at 6563 @xcite . in any case ,",
    "any residual detection of the [ sii ]  lines , because they originate in ions of similar ionization potential to those that emit the [ nii ]  6548 ,  6584  lines , would make no significant difference to a determination of the position of a feature in a lobe of kjpn  8 .",
    "the ratio of continuum starlight to the nebular emission line light is of course much higher in the broad band possi - r image than in the narrower bandwidth 2011 h@xmath0[n  ii ]  image .",
    "this leads to the detection of more faint stars and the spread in the photographic emulsion of the images of brighter stars in the possi - r data .",
    "however , the angular resolution is unaffected and very similar in both observations ( see the faint stellar images in fig .",
    "2a - d ) . with these differences in mind",
    "only the changes in positions of the peak brightnesses of compact knots and fine filaments are measured in the present work .",
    "proof of the validity of this comparison and the simple method of analysis is found in @xcite and @xcite both dealing with epms of similar high  speed lobes of ngc 6302 . in @xcite ,",
    "nebular positions from a recent ccd narrow  band image are compared with those from a historic broadband image obtained with 103ae photographic emulsion and different telescope .",
    "the epms in @xcite match closely their values in the complementary measurements made by @xcite employing only hubble space telescope images .",
    "furthermore , the epm rate of one bright knot in the a1 lobe in paper 1 , where its change in position between the possi and possii surveys was compared , is reproduced , within the quoted uncertainties , in the present work . an identical method of analysis to that described here was employed .",
    "the dynamical age of a feature given in table 1 is its angular distance from the nebular core , measured using the image in fig .",
    "1 , divided by its epm rate .",
    "the dynamical age of a knot assumes that its measured epm , over a limited time interval , has been maintained during its whole passage from its point of origin to its present position .",
    "obviously decelerations are likely to have occurred if it encounters a significant ambient medium since leaving the ejecting source .",
    "however , its value can give an indication of the sequence of events and it remains possible ( sect .",
    "6 ) that the a1 & a2 as well as the b1 & b2 outflows have travelled through tenuous material in pre  formed large cavities .    here , the ejecting source is assumed to be the central star at ra(2000 ) 23h24m10.408s dec(2000 ) 605730.61discovered in the hubble space telescope image .",
    "the angular separations listed in column 5 of table 1 are the apparent distances from this star .",
    "the dynamical ages of the knots listed in column 6 of table 1 are then simply the division of these separations by the respective epm rates in column 4 .",
    "it is clear from these dynamical ages that the a1 & a2 outflows are the bi ",
    "polar consequence of the same event i.e. they have been ejected in opposite directions with the same speeds but along the same axis . only the knots a2h and",
    "a2i fail to fit this pattern .",
    "a2h appears to be moving at a substantial angle to the general outflow and a2i has a significantly smaller dynamical age .",
    "excluding these two knots the mean dynamical age of the a1 & a2 outflows is 3200 yr .    with a dynamical age of 7218 yr knot b2 is a significantly older feature than the a1 & a2 outflows and with an age of @xmath2 5 @xmath610@xmath16 yr c1 must be the earliest event in the creation of the lobes surrounding kjpn  8 .",
    "there are several serious weaknesses in the determination of the distance , d , to kjpn  8 in paper i. firstly , the epm of only one knot in the a1 & a2 outflow was derived from comparison of possi ",
    "r ( 1954 ) and possii  r ( 1991 ) images .",
    "it is sounder to include more knots in this measurement , as in the present paper , to avoid the possibility that a single knot could be unrepresentitive .",
    "furthermore , the crucial value of the angle to the plane of the sky , @xmath17 , of the outflow was determined using the predictions of the theoretical model of bow ",
    "shocks @xcite .",
    "firstly , this assumes that the emission is from bow shocks around multiple ejecta , which is most likely though not certain . within this model",
    "it is assumed that the full width of the line profiles equals the difference in outflow velocity and the medium it is colliding with .",
    "the error on d quoted in paper i includes only that from the epm measurement and does not include any uncertainty due to these obvious weaknesses in its derivation .    here",
    ", these basic weaknesses have now been addressed : the epms of many knots within the a1 &  a2 outflow and a direct value of @xmath17 , from a subsequent hst image of the nebular core , have both been determined .    from the values in table  [ table1 ]",
    "the weighted mean of the a1 & a2 outflow epm ( for knots a1a , b &  c and a2a , b , c , f & g ) is 1.93 @xmath1 0.1 arcsec which in 57 yr gives an epm rate of 33.9 @xmath1 0.18 mas yr@xmath18 .",
    "it seems most probable that the a1 & a2 outflow is along the axis of the central toroidal disk of kjpn  8 which appears as a 2.4@xmath6 1.3  elliptical ring . as this",
    "is assumed to be a circular toroid viewed at an angle then its axis must be tilted by @xmath17 = 32.6 . as the magnitude of the difference in radial velocity @xmath19= 180 of both the a1 & a2 outflows , with respect to the systemic radial velocity , then the outflow velocity v @xmath9 334  and tangential velocity v@xmath20  @xmath9  281  .",
    "the relationship of d , epm rate and outflow velocity v along a line at an angle @xmath17 to the plane of the sky is :    @xmath21    insertion of the measured values in eq .",
    "1 therefore gives d @xmath9 1.8 @xmath1 0.3 kpc .",
    "the uncertainty in d is larger than that given by the standard deviation of the epms in table  [ table1 ] alone for it must also include the range of  values observed within the outflow and the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath17 .",
    "incidentally , the large projected extents of the a1 & a2 , b1 & b2 and c1 & c2 ( ? ) lobes of 2.1 pc , 2.4 pc and 7.4 pc respectively are confirmed by this new distance measurement .",
    "the dynamical ages in sect .",
    "4 are the first direct evidence of the sequence of events that must have formed the giant lobes of kjpn  8 .",
    "firstly , the lobe culminating in c1 & c2 ( ? ) was formed by a collimated , but shortlived , bi  polar ejection ( episodic jet ) @xmath4",
    "5@xmath610@xmath16 yr ago .",
    "larger cavities around the path of this jet were then created most likely by the mechanism described by @xcite . both the b1 & b2 and a1 & a2 bipolar outflows have their brightest optical emissions where they collide with the edges of these large cavities 7200 and 3200 yr ago respectively . within this interpretation",
    "these latter dynamical ages are likely to be the real ages because the ejected material will have travelled along different axes but through the low density ambient medium within the evacuated cavity interior .",
    "the distance measurement to kjpn  8 of d@xmath91.8 @xmath1 0.3 kpc derived in sect .",
    "5 is on a far firmer footing than the previous one in paper i. however , as its value in paper i is close to this latest determination , the bow - shock interpretation of the full width of the line profiles ( taken to be equal the outflow velocity @xcite ) that was employed in paper i , but not here , is vindicated .",
    "it is also interesting that the 15  radius disk of co emission surrounding the small optical core of kjpn  8 has an expansion velocity of 7  @xcite to give a dynamical age of 2 @xmath6 10@xmath16 yr when combined with this latest measurement of d. this implies that the creation of this central neutral disk not only certainly preceded the a1 & a2 bipolar ejection but also , marginally , that of b1 & b2 .    a sound order  of  magnitude estimation of the kinetic energy ( ke ) of the outflows from kjpn  8 can now be made with d@xmath91.8 kpc after the volume of the ionized gas is estimated for the most energetic a1 & a2 bipolar outflow . with the local electron density n@xmath22 @xmath9 100 @xmath23 from the [ sii ]  ratios measured by @xcite the outflowing mass of a1 & a2",
    "ionized gas is then 0.08  and with v@xmath9334   ( sect .",
    "5 ) the ke @xmath4 10@xmath5 erg is derived . both this ke and v are then comparable to those for the poly  polar planetary nebula , ngc 6302 , which led @xcite to suggest an ilot origin . the older lobes of kjpn  8 defined by the c1 & c2 ( ? ) and",
    "b1 & b2 point symmetric features ( see table 1 ) may also have been generated by the same binary system with a rotating axis which culminated in the final ilot outburst of which the a1 & a2 outflow is the consequence .",
    "the three axes of ejection of the kjpn  8 lobes , with different pas , suggest alone their origin in a close binary system .",
    "another criterion for this classification by @xcite in ngc 6302 is the hubble - type nature of its outflowing lobes i.e. the outflow velocities along a lobe are proportional to the distance from the origin ( see @xcite ; @xcite for ngc 6302 ) .",
    "there is only marginal evidence in table 1 for this to be the case for kjpn  8 .",
    "perhaps , slower bullets within the a1 & a2 outflow are travelling within a cavity and not excited until they hit its boundary where they become excited knots .",
    "the recent appearance of knot a2e , seen first in the 1991 image ( paper i ) and here in the 2011 image but not in the 1954 one ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , suggests that this could be the case .",
    "the detailed nature of the ionized knots in the a1 & a2 outflow , however , remains uncertain .",
    "is the knotty optical line emission from concave bow  shocks , as seen from the central star of kjpn  8 , around ` bullets ' , sprayed out in a wide bipolar cone , as they encounter the ambient medium or , alternatively , from convex bow  shocks as a bipolar cone of less collimated , ejected , material encounters dense clumps in the surrounding shell wall ?",
    "the first possibility seems most likely though the string of knots coincident with the wall of the larger cavity of a1 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , of which knot a1c is one of these , could suggest the latter possibilty is correct .",
    "images of the knots in the optical emission lines , at higher angular resolution ( @xmath10 0.1 ) , are now needed to determine the concave or convex nature of the bow  shocks .",
    "the ilot origin of the youngest a1 & a2 lobes of kjpn  8 would require an agb star in a close binary system at the core of kjpn  8 .",
    "a candidate for such a star ( or its immediate agb aftermath ) must be the merlin 6 cm point ( @xmath10 0.1  diameter ) thermal radio source which , though somewhat offset from the centre of the ionized ring of kjpn  8 , is embedded in a larger knot of h@xmath15  emission within the nebular core .",
    "this object at ra(2000 ) 23h24m10.399s dec(2000 ) 605730.14   is separated by 0.34  from the hst central star which corresponds , with d = 1.8 kpc , to an apparent separation of 800 au whereas @xcite give a requirement of @xmath10 5 au for the mass transfer to occur in the central system of ngc 6302 within an ilot configuration .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the stellar systems in the core of kjpn  8 , particulary any assocated directly with the merlin radio source , are required before firm conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the merlin source could be the required close binary but within a more complex stellar system .",

    "the dynamical ages of these features are then 3200 , 7,218 and @xmath2 5 @xmath6 10@xmath16 y respectively .",
    "\\2 ) the outflow velocity of the a1 & a2 bipolar lobe is 334   as derived from its measured changes in radial velocity and its angle of tilt with respect to the plane of the sky derived from hst imagery .",
    "\\3 ) a very sound distance , d , to kjpn  8 is derived in the present paper as 1.8 @xmath1 0.3 kpc .",
    "this has been derived by combining the epm rate of the a1 & a2 outflow , now for several unresolved knots , with the measurement of the radial velocity difference and the newly derived outflow angle , @xmath17 , to the plane of the sky .",
    "\\4 ) this new value of d is very similar to the less certain one in paper i which was derived from the epm rate of only one knot in the a1 & a2 outflow combined with a more uncertain value of @xmath17 which depended on the theoretical predictions of a bow shock model .",
    "this similarity could suggest that the a1 & a2 line emission is originating in bow shocks and the theoretical predictions of the bow shock model are sound .",
    "imagery of the a1 & a2 lobe at 10 times higher angular resolution could confirm the existence of bow shocks around small high  speed bullets .",
    "\\5 ) a candidate for the dust enshrouded massive agb star ( or its immediate aftermath ) that is required , if the youngest , and most energetic , a1 & a2 lobes of kjpn  8 , originated in an ilot event , could be the compact radio source in the central nebula .",
    "any evidence that this is a close binary system should be searched for .",
