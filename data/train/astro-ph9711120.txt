    "soft gamma repeaters exhibit long periods of quiescence , often spanning years , punctuated by periods of intense bursting activity during which many brief ( durations @xmath13 s ) and intense ( luminosities l@xmath14 l@xmath15 ) bursts are emitted by the source @xcite . believed to be neutron stars , the mechanism(s ) for both the steady and bursting x  ray emission is still not well understood ( @xcite ) .",
    "sgr 1806 - 20 is the most prolific sgr , and it has been studied in the x ",
    "ray @xcite , optical @xcite , infrared @xcite , and radio @xcite bands .",
    "the source became active again during the fall of 1996 , emitting many powerful bursts that were first detected with batse @xcite .",
    "a target of opportunity observation by the _ rossi x  ray timing explorer _",
    "( rxte ) was initiated on november 5 , 1996 .",
    "the data analyzed here were taken during that @xmath16 ks observation , which spanned the time interval starting at 10:53:20 ut ( 11/5/96 ) and ending at 10:52:00 ut ( 11/6/96 ) .",
    "the hexte instrument @xcite aboard rxte consists of two clusters of collimated nai / csi phoswich detectors with a total net area of @xmath17 @xmath18 and an effective energy range of @xmath19 kev .",
    "the sgr observations discussed here were taken with the hexte in the @xmath20 second rocking mode , in which one cluster is always on the source , with the other pointed off - source for background accumulation .",
    "the clusters then beam - switch every 16 seconds , in such a way that one cluster is always locked on - source .",
    "the on - source hexte data were binned into a time series for @xmath21 energy bands ( @xmath22 kev , @xmath23 kev , and @xmath24 kev ) .",
    "the @xmath22 kev time series for each continuous data stretch was searched for bursts using a bayesian burst search algorithm developed at ucsd .",
    "the algorithm calculates the probability of a given number of bursts in each data stretch by incorporating the information on the expected background flux in each time bin .",
    "the burst search yielded @xmath2 bursts , all of which correspond to bursts seen by the pca .",
    "the burst times and durations are shown in table 1 , and the lightcurve of two of the brighter bursts ( @xmath25 & @xmath26 ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the durations of the bursts seen by hexte ranges from less than @xmath27 to @xmath28 seconds , and the weakest burst detected by hexte corresponds to a pca count rate of @xmath29 counts s@xmath6 .",
    "all of the hexte bursts were fit to thermal bremsstrahlung and power law functions using xspec , but only the @xmath26 brightest bursts yielded well - constrained spectral fits . in all the burst spectral fits , background was taken from _ on - source _ data taken immediately preceding and following the burst .",
    "the counts spectra were fit over the energy range @xmath30 kev , and the resulting best - fit parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "the weakest sgr 180620 burst seen by hexte has a @xmath7 kev flux of @xmath3 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "co - adding the 11 dim bursts and fitting them with power law and bremsstrahlung functions yields the best - fit parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 kev for the mean spectrum of the weak hexte bursts .",
    "the hexte counts spectrum of a bright burst ( burst 2 ) is shown in figure 2 , with the best - fit thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum overplotted .",
    "the @xmath33 values were typically large for the stronger bursts , suggesting that more complicated spectral models may be needed to adequately fit the burst spectra .",

    "this is consistent with previous measurements of sgr 180620 burst temperatures @xcite . a chi - squared test for a constant temperature yields @xmath36 for @xmath37 , or a @xmath38 chance that the bursts all had the same temperature , suggesting that there may be some intrinsic variability in the burst spectra .",
    "the results of the hexte observations of sgr 1806 - 20 bursts are in general agreement with the durations @xcite and bremsstrahlung temperatures @xcite obtained by previous observers .",
    "the x  ray luminosities ( @xmath7 kev ) of the bursts , in units of the eddington luminosity , span the range @xmath39 , assuming a distance to the source of @xmath40 kpc @xcite , isotropic emission , and an eddington luminosity of @xmath41 egs s@xmath6 .    in the future",
    ", we plan on using the data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard rxte , in conjunction with the hexte data , to fit the sgr 180620 burst spectra over the entire @xmath42 kev energy range of the two instruments .",
    "this will result in a more accurate determination of the continuum spectral shape of the sgr bursts ."
