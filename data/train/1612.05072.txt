    "a large literature has investigated whether economic variables such as , e.g. , the price - dividend ratio , proxies of labour income , or the interest rate can predict stock returns . the econometric approach to test for predictability is mostly based on a predictive regression of stock returns onto a set of lagged financial variables ; see , e.g. , stambaugh ( 1999 ) .",
    "important differences between testing approaches in the literature arise because of the different test statistics , asymptotic theories or resampling approaches used to test the null hypothesis of no predictability .",
    "these differences lead in a number of cases to diverging results and conclusions .",
    "mankiw and shapiro ( 1986 ) and stambaugh ( 1986 ) note that in a setting with endogenous predictor and correlated innovations standard asymptotic theory causes small sample biases that may imply an overrejection of the hypothesis of no predictability . to mitigate the problem ,",
    "recent studies propose tests based on bias - corrected estimators of predictive regressions .",
    "for instance , stambaugh ( 1999 ) , and amihud , hurvich and wang ( 2008 ) introduce bias - corrected ols estimators for the univariate and the multi - predictor setting , respectively .",
    "recent work has also considered the issue of endogenous integrated or nearly integrated predictors , following the evidence in torous , valkanov and yan ( 2004 ) that various variables assumed to predict stock returns follow a local - to - unit root autoregressive process .",
    "lewellen ( 2004 ) , torous , valkanov and yan ( 2004 ) , and campbell and yogo ( 2006 ) introduce testing procedures and more accurate unit - root and local - to - unit root asymptotics for predictive regression models with a single persistent predictor and correlated innovations .",
    "more recently , kostakis , magdalinos and stamatogiannis ( 2015 ) propose a new class of test statistics , by extending the instrumental variables approach in magdalinos and phillips ( 2009 ) to predictive regressions .    a general approach to obtain tests that are less susceptible to finite sample biases or assumptions on the form of their asymptotic distribution relies on nonparametric monte carlo simulation methods , such as the bootstrap or the subsampling .",
    "ang and bekaert ( 2007 ) use the bootstrap to quantify the bias of parameter estimation in a regression of stock returns on the lagged dividend yield and the interest rate . in a multi - predictor setting with nearly integrated regressors , amihud , hurvich and wang ( 2008 ) compare the results of bootstrap tests to bias - corrected procedures and find the latter to have accurate size and good power properties .",
    "wolf ( 2000 ) introduces subsampling tests of stock return predictability in single - predictor models .    as shown in hall and horowitz ( 1996 ) and andrews ( 2002 ) , among others , a desirable property of bootstrap tests",
    "is that they may provide asymptotic refinements of the sampling distribution of standard @xmath0-test statistics for testing the hypothesis of no predictability .- test statistic are of lower order with respect to the sample size than those implied by the conventional asymptotics .",
    "] moreover , as shown in romano and wolf ( 2001 ) , choi and chue ( 2007 ) , and andrews and guggenberger ( 2009 , 2010 ) , subsampling methods produce reliable inference also in predictive regression models with multiple nearly integrated predictors .",
    "a common feature of all above approaches to test predictability hypotheses is their reliance on procedures that can be heavily influenced by a small fraction of anomalous observations in the data . for standard ols estimators and @xmath0-test statistics ,",
    "this problem is well - known since a long time ; see , e.g. , huber ( 1981 ) for a review .",
    "more recent research has also shown that inference provided by bootstrap and subsampling tests may be easily inflated by a small fraction of anomalous observations .",
    "intuitively , we explain this feature by the too high fraction of anomalous observations that is often simulated by conventional bootstrap and subsampling procedures , when compared to the actual fraction of outliers in the original data .",
    "it is not possible to mitigate this problem simply by applying conventional bootstrap or subsampling methods to more robust estimators or test statistics .",
    "resampling trimmed or winsorized estimators does not yield a robust resampling method ( see singh , 1988 , camponovo , trojani and scaillet , 2012 , for detailed examples ) .",
    "hence , we consider in this paper a new robust resample methodology for time series , which allows us to develop more robust tests of predictability hypotheses in predictive regression settings .",
    "our robust predictive regression approach relies on robust weighted least - squares procedures that are data - driven and easily manageable .",
    "this can be motivated economically with the presence of a time - varying ambiguity about predictive relations , which is consistently addressed by ambiguity averse investors using robust estimators that bound the effects of anomalous data features .",
    "wrampelmeyer , wiehenkamp and trojani ( 2015 ) show that different specifications of aversion to ambiguity in the literature imply robust optimal estimator choices related to robust weighted least - squares . in this sense ,",
    "our robust predictive regression testing approach is consistent with the preferences of investors that dislike a time - varying ambiguity in the data - generating processes for returns .",
    "the data - driven weights in the procedure dampen , where necessary , the few data points that are estimated as anomalous with respect to the postulated predictive link .",
    "this feature automatically avoids , e.g. , arguing ex ante that a large value of the predicted or the predictive variables is per se an anomalous observation , which is not in general the case .",
    "indeed , observations linked to large values of both the predictive and the predicted variables might be very informative about a potential predictability structure and discarding them in an ad hoc way might bias the inference . in a multivariate predictive regression setting , it is even more difficult to determine with an informal approach which subset of observations is potentially anomalous , for example by eyeballing the data . a useful property of our methodology it that it embeds a formal data - driven identification of observations that can be excessively influential for the resulting inference on predictive relations .",
    "the more detailed contributions to the literature are as follows .",
    "first , using monte carlo simulations we find that the size and power of conventional hypothesis testing methods for predictive regressions , including bias - corrected tests , tests implied by local - to - unity asymptotics , and conventional bootstrap and subsampling tests , are dramatically nonresistant to even small fractions of anomalous observations in the data",
    ". even though the test probability of rejecting a null by chance alone features some degree of resistance in our monte carlo experiments , the test ability to reject the null of no predictability when it is violated is in most cases drastically reduced .",
    "second , we quantify theoretically the robustness properties of subsampling and bootstrap tests in a time series context , borrowing from the concept of breakdown point , which is a measure of the degree of resistance of a testing procedure to outliers ; see , e.g. , hampel ( 1971 ) , donoho and huber ( 1983 ) , and hampel , ronchetti , rousseeuw and stahel ( 1986 ) . in section 3.3 below , theorem 1 ( and its proof ) for subsampling differs from theorem 2 ( and its proof ) in camponovo , scaillet and trojani ( 2012 ) valid for the i.i.d .",
    "case since subsamples in a time series context are not generated in the same way in order to avoid breaking serial dependences .",
    "theorem 1 ( and its proof ) for block bootstrap is also new , and not a straightforward extension of the results in singh ( 1998 ) for the i.i.d . bootstrap .",
    "third , we develop a novel class of resampling tests of predictability , which are resistant to anomalous observations and consistent with nearly integrated regressors at sustainable computational costs .",
    "we confirm by monte carlo simulations that these tests successfully limit the damaging effect of outliers , by preserving desirable finite sample properties in presence of anomalous observations .",
    "finally , we provide a robust analysis of the recent empirical evidence on stock return predictability for us stock market data . following cochrane ( 2008 )",
    ", our main purpose is not to determine the best return - forecasting specification , but rather to study the amount of predictability resulting from very simple specifications , motivated by economic theory for the vast majority for the data .",
    "we study single - predictor and multi - predictor models , using several well - known predictive variables suggested in the literature , such as the lagged dividend yield , the difference between option - implied volatility and realized volatility ( bollerslev , tauchen and zhou , 2009 ) , the interest rate , and the share of labor income to consumption ( santos and veronesi , 2006 ) .",
    "our robust tests of predictability produce the following novel empirical evidence .",
    "first , we find that the dividend yield is a robust predictive variable of market returns , which is significant at the 5% significance in all our regressions , for each subperiod , sampling frequency and forecasting horizon considered . in univariate regressions with monthly data , the lagged dividend yield is significant at the 5% level according to the robust tests , in each window of 180 monthly observations from january 1980 to december 2010 . in contrast ,",
    "bias - corrected methods , local - to - unity asymptotics and conventional sabsampling tests produce a weaker and more ambiguous evidence overall , e.g. , by not rejecting the null of no predictability at the 10% significance level in the subperiod from january 1995 to december 2010 .",
    "multi - predictor regressions including variance risk premium and labor income proxies confirm the significant predictive power of the dividend yield . while the dividend yield is again significant at the 5% level in all cases using the robust tests , it is significant only at the 10% level using the conventional tests in the sample period 1994 - 2009 , within monthly predictive regressions including the difference of implied and realized volatility as a predictive variable .",
    "it is not significant using conventional tests in the sample period 1955 - 2010 within quarterly predictive regression based on the share of labor income to consumption .",
    "a weak evidence of predictability for future returns and cash flows is at odd with the fundamental present - value relations linking expected returns , expected cash - flows and the price - dividend ratio ; see also cochrane ( 2011 ) . therefore , our robust findings of market return predictability are consistent with the main logic of basic present - value models .",
    "second , we find that the difference between option - implied volatility and realized volatility is a robust predictive variable of future market returns at quarterly forecasting horizons . it is always significant at the 5% significance level in each window of 180 observations , using both robust and nonrobust testing approaches .",
    "this finding supports the remarkable market return forecasting ability of the variance risk premium , noted in bollerslev , tauchen and zhou ( 2009 ) and confirmed in bollerslev , marrone and zhou ( 2014 ) in an international context .",
    "third , using conventional testing approaches , we find that the evidence of return predictability associated with the ratio of labor income to consumption is either absent or weak in the sample periods 1955 - 2000 and 1965 - 2010 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the null of no predictability is always rejected at the 5% significance level by our robust testing method , indicating that the weak and ambiguous evidence produced by the conventional tests is likely a consequence of their low power in presence of anomalous observations .",
    "fourth , we exploit the properties of our robust testing method to identify observations that might excessively influence the diverging conclusions of conventional testing approaches .",
    "we find a fraction of less than about 5% of influential observations in the data , which tend to be more frequent during the nasdaq bubble and the more recent financial crisis .",
    "such influential data points , including the lehman brothers default on september 2008 , the terrorist attack of september 2001 , the black monday on october 1987 , and the dot - com bubble collapse in august 2002 , are largely responsible for the failure of conventional testing methods in uncovering the hidden predictability structures .",
    "finally , we find that our results can not be substantially improved by specifying predictive relations with time - varying parameters , as we do not find evidence of structural breaks in our sample period after controlling for the impact of anomalous observations .",
    "motivated by the findings in goyal and welch ( 2003 ) and campbell and thompson ( 2008 ) , we also show that the predictive relations detected by our robust approach generate incremental out - of - sample predictive power over a monthly forecasting horizon , improving on both the predictive relations estimated by conventional methods or those of a simple forecast based on the sample mean of market returns .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the usual predictive regression model , and we illustrate by simulation the robustness problem of some of the recent tests of predictability proposed in the literature . in section 3 ,",
    "we study theoretically the robustness properties of bootstrap and subsampling approximations . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce our robust approach , and develop robust bootstrap and subsampling tests of predictability . in section 5",
    ", we apply our robust testing procedure to us equity data and reconsider some of the recent empirical evidence on market return predictability .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "in this section , we introduce the benchmark predictive regression model and a number of recent methods proposed for testing the predictability of stock returns . through monte carlo simulations , we study the finite - sample properties of these testing procedures both in presence and absence of anomalous observations . in section [ pm ] , we first introduce the model . in section [ ri ] ,",
    "we focus on bias - corrected methods and testing procedures based on local - to - unity asymptotics .",
    "finally , in section [ rm ] , we consider testing approaches based on resampling methods .",
    "we consider the predictive regression model , @xmath1 where , @xmath2 denotes the stock return at time @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an economic variable observed at time @xmath5 , predicting @xmath2 . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the unknown intercepts of the linear regression model and the autoregressive model , respectively , @xmath8 is the unknown parameter of interest , @xmath9 is the unknown autoregressive coefficient , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are error terms with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a scalar random variable .    in this setting , it is well - known that inference based on standard asymptotic theory suffers from small sample biases , which may imply an overrejection of the hypothesis of no predictability , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the true value of the unknown parameter @xmath17 ; see mankiw and shapiro ( 1986 ) , and stambaugh ( 1986 ) , among others .",
    "moreover , as emphasized in torous , valkanov , and yan ( 2004 ) , various state variables considered as predictors in model ( [ pregmodel1])-([pregmodel2 ] ) might be well approximated by a nearly integrated process , which might motivate a local - to - unity framework @xmath18 , @xmath19 , for the autoregressive coefficient of model ( [ pregmodel2 ] ) , implying a nonstandard asymptotic distribution for the ols estimator @xmath20 of parameter @xmath17 .",
    "several recent testing procedures have been proposed in order to overcome these problems .",
    "stambaugh ( 1999 ) , lewellen ( 2004 ) , amihud and hurvich ( 2004 ) , polk , thompson and vuolteenaho ( 2006 ) , and amihud , hurvich and wang ( 2008 , 2010 ) , among others , propose bias - corrected procedures that correct the bias implied by the ols estimator @xmath20 of parameter @xmath17 .",
    "cavanagh , elliott and stock ( 1995 ) , torous , valkanov and yan ( 2004 ) , and campbell and yogo ( 2006 ) , among others , introduce testing procedures based on local - to - unity asymptotics that provide more accurate approximations of the sampling distribution of the @xmath0-statistic @xmath21 in nearly integrated settings , where @xmath22 is an estimate of the standard deviation of the ols estimator @xmath20 .",
    "kostakis , magdalinos and stamatogiannis ( 2015 ) also propose a new class of test statistics by extending the instrumental variables approach develop in magdalinos and phillips ( 2009 ) to predictive regressions .",
    "a common feature of bias - corrected methods and inference based on local - to - unity asymptotics is a nonresistance to anomalous observations , which may lead to conclusions determined by the particular features of a small subfraction of the data .",
    "intuitively , this feature emerges because these approaches exploit statistical tools that can be sensitive to small deviations from the predictive regression model ( [ pregmodel1])-([pregmodel2 ] ) . consequently , despite the good accuracy under the strict model assumptions , these testing procedures may become less efficient or biased even with a small fraction of anomalous observations in the data .    to illustrate the lack of robustness of this class of tests , we analyze through monte carlo simulation the bias - corrected method proposed in amihud , hurvich and wang ( 2008 ) and the bonferroni approach for the local - to - unity asymptotic theory introduced in campbell and yogo ( 2006 ) .",
    "we first generate @xmath23 samples @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , of size @xmath26 according to model ( [ pregmodel1])-([pregmodel2 ] ) , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",

    "we study the finite sample properties of tests of the null hypothesis @xmath42 in the predictive regression model . in the first two rows of figure [ poweracy ]",
    ", we plot the empirical frequency of rejection of null hypothesis @xmath43 for the bias - corrected method proposed in amihud , hurvich and wang ( 2008 ) and the bonferroni approach for the local - to - unity asymptotic theory introduced in campbell and yogo ( 2006 ) , respectively , with respect to different values of the alternative hypothesis @xmath32 , and different degree of persistence of the predictors @xmath31 .",
    "the nominal significance level of the test is @xmath44 .",
    "the results for different degree of persistence are qualitatively very similar . in the monte carlo simulation with noncontaminated samples ( straight line ) , we find that the fraction of null hypothesis rejections of all procedures is quite close to the nominal level @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "as expected , the power of the tests increases for increasing values of @xmath46 . in the simulation with contaminated samples ( dashed line ) ,",
    "the size of all tests remains quite close to the nominal significance level .",
    "in contrast , the presence of anomalous observations dramatically deteriorates the power of both procedures .",
    "indeed , for @xmath47 , the frequency of rejection of the null hypothesis for both tests is much lower than in the noncontaminated case .",
    "unreported monte carlo results for the instrumental variable approach proposed in kostakis , magdalinos and stamatogiannis ( 2015 ) produce similar findings .    the results in figure [ poweracy ] highlight the lack of resistance to anomalous data of bias - corrected methods and inference based on local - to - unity asymptotics .",
    "because of a small fraction of anomalous observations , the testing procedures become unreliable , and are unable to reject the null hypothesis of no predictability , even for large values of @xmath16 .",
    "this is a relevant aspect for applications , in which typically the statistical evidence of predictability is weak .    to overcome this robustness problem ,",
    "a natural approach is to develop more resistant versions of the nonrobust tests considered in our monte carlo exercise .",
    "however , this task may be hard to achieve in general .",
    "a more general approach to obtain tests that are less susceptible to finite sample biases or assumptions on their asymptotic distribution can rely on nonparametric monte carlo simulation methods .",
    "we address these methods in the sequel .",
    "nonparametric monte carlo simulation methods , such as the bootstrap and the subsampling , may provide improved inferences in predictive regression model ( [ pregmodel1])-([pregmodel2 ] ) both in stationary or nearly integrated settings .",
    "as shown in hall and horowitz ( 1996 ) and andrews ( 2002 ) , for stationary data the block bootstrap may yield improved approximations to the sampling distribution of the standard @xmath0-statistics for testing predictability , having asymptotic errors of lower order in sample size .",
    "moreover , as shown in choi and chue ( 2007 ) and andrews and guggenberger ( 2010 ) , we can use the subsampling to produce correct inferences in nearly integrated settings .",
    "we first introduce block bootstrap and subsampling procedures .",
    "we then focus on predictive regression model ( [ pregmodel1])-([pregmodel2 ] ) and study by monte carlo simulation the degree of resistance to anomalous observations of bootstrap and subsampling tests of predictability , both in stationary and nearly integrated settings .",
    "consider a random sample @xmath48 from a time series of random vectors @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and a general statistic @xmath51 .",
    "block bootstrap procedures split the original sample @xmath52 into overlapping blocks of size @xmath53 . from these blocks , bootstrap samples @xmath54 of size @xmath55",
    "are randomly generated .",
    "finally , the empirical distribution of statistic @xmath56 is used to estimate the sampling distribution of @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , the more recent subsampling method applies statistic @xmath58 directly to overlapping random blocks @xmath59 of size @xmath60 strictly less than @xmath55 .",
    "then , the empirical distribution of statistic @xmath61 is used to estimate the sampling distribution of @xmath57 , under the assumption that the impact of the block size is asymptotically negligible ( @xmath62 ) .    in the predictive regression model ( [ pregmodel1])-([pregmodel2 ] ) , the usual @xmath0-test statistic for testing the null of no predictability is @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we can define a block bootstrap test of the null hypothesis with the block bootstrap statistic @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an estimate of the standard deviation of the ols estimator @xmath65 in a random bootstrap sample of size @xmath55 , constructed using blocks of size @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , we can define a subsampling test of the same null hypothesis with the subsampling statistic @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is now an estimator of the standard deviation of the ols estimator @xmath68 in a random overlapping block of size @xmath53 .",
    "it is well - known that ols estimators and empirical averages are very sensitive to even small fractions of anomalous observations in the data ; see , e.g. , huber ( 1981 ) .",

    "similarly , let @xmath75 denote an overlapping subsampling block .",
    "the construction of blocks is a key difference with respect to the i.i.d . setting , and implies a different extension of available results on breakdown properties for i.i.d",

    ", we also consider the three - predictor model @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the detrended long - term yield , defined as the ten - year treasury yield minus its trailing twelve - month moving averages . again , using the standard subsampling and the robust subsampling , we find evidence in favor of predictability at @xmath239 significance level for the variance risk premium for the sample period 1990 - 2010 .",
    "in contrast , all tests do not reject the null hypothesis of no predictability at @xmath44 significance level for the detrended long - term yield .",
    "finally , both conventional and robust tests reject the null hypothesis of no predictability at the @xmath239 significance level for the dividend yield .",
    "the comparison of these empirical results with those obtained in the two - predictor model ( [ pregmodel3f ] ) again confirms the reliability of our robust tests and the ( possible ) failure of nonrobust procedures in uncovering predictability structures in presence of anomalous observations . ] finally , also for this predictive regression model , we do not find evidence of structural breaks at the @xmath44 significance level .",
    "moreover , we obtain out - of - sample statistics @xmath240 and @xmath241 , indicating again an improved out - of - sample predictive power for our robust approach .",
    "we finally focus on the two - predictor regression model proposed in santos and veronesi ( 2006 ) : @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the share of labor income to consumption .",
    "we make use of quarterly returns on the value weighted crsp index , which includes nyse , amex , and nasdaq stocks , in the sample period q1,1955-q4,2010 . the dividend time - series is also obtained from crsp , while the risk free rate is the three - months treasury bill rate .",
    "labor income and consumption are obtained from the bureau of economic analysis .",
    "let @xmath229 and @xmath230 denote the true values of parameters @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "using subsampling tests , as well as our robust testing method , we first test the null hypothesis of no predictability by the dividend yield , @xmath233 .",
    "table [ tablef45 ] collects detailed point estimates and test results for the four subperiods 1950 - 1995 , 1955 - 2000 , 1960 - 2005 , 1965 - 2010 .",
    "we find again that our robust tests always clearly reject @xmath244 at the @xmath239-significance level .",
    "in contrast , conventional tests produce more ambiguous results , and can not reject at the 10%-significance level the null hypothesis @xmath244 for subperiod 1955 - 2000 .",
    "table [ tablef45 ] summarizes estimation and testing results for parameter @xmath230 .",
    "while the conventional tests produce a weak and mixed evidence of return predictability using labor income proxies , e.g. , by not rejecting @xmath245 at the 10%-level in subperiod 1950 - 1995 , the robust tests produce once more a clear and consistent predictability evidence for all sample periods .",
    "the clusters of anomalous observations ( less than @xmath246 of the data in the full sample ) , highlighted by the estimated weights in figure [ huberweights2 ] , further indicate that conventional tests might fail to uncover hidden predictability structures using samples of data that include observations from the nasdaq bubble or the recent financial crisis , a feature that was noted in santos and veronesi ( 2006 ) and lettau and van nieuwerburgh ( 2007 ) from a completely different angle . in such contexts ,",
    "the robust subsampling tests are again found to control well the potential damaging effects of anomalous observations , by providing a way to consistently uncover hidden predictability features also when the data may only approximately follow the given predictive regression model .",
    "we do not find evidence of structural breaks in the predictive relation at the @xmath44 significance level , while we obtain an out - of - sample statistic @xmath247 , indicating that our robust approach improves the out - of - sample predictions of classical predictive regression methods .",
    "however , in this case the out - of - sample statistic @xmath248 shows no improvement over quarterly forecasts provided by standard sample mean of market returns .",
    "a large literature studies the predictive ability of a variety of economic variables for future market returns .",
    "several useful testing approaches for testing the null of no predictability in predictive regressions with correlated errors and nearly integrated regressors have been proposed , including tests that rely on nonparametric monte carlo simulation methods , such as the bootstrap and subsampling .",
    "all these methods improve on the conventional asymptotic tests under the ideal assumption of an exact predictive regression model . however , we find by monte carlo evidence that even small violations of such assumptions , generated by a small fraction of anomalous observations , can result in large deteriorations in the reliability of all these tests . to systematically understand the problem ,",
    "we characterize theoretically the robustness properties of resampling tests of predictability in a time series context , using the concept of quantile breakdown point , which is a measure of the global resistance of a testing procedure to outliers .",
    "we obtain general quantile breakdown point formulas , which highlight an important nonresistance of these tests to anomalous observations that might infrequently contaminate the predictive regression model , thus confirming the fragility detected in our monte carlo study .",
    "we propose a more robust testing method for predictive regressions with correlated errors and nearly integrated regressors , by introducing a novel general class of fast and robust resampling procedures for predictive regression models at sustainable computational costs .",
    "the new resampling tests are resistant to anomalous observations in the data and imply more robust confidence intervals and inference results .",
    "we demonstrate by monte carlo simulations their good resistance to outliers and their improved finite - sample properties in presence of anomalous observations .    in our empirical study for us stock market data , we study single - predictor and multi - predictor models , using well - known predictive variables in the literature , such as the market dividend yield , the difference between index option - implied volatility and realized volatility ( bollerslev , tauchen and zhou , 2009 ) , and the share of labor income to consumption ( santos and veronesi , 2006 ) .",
    "first , using the robust tests we find clear - cut evidence that the dividend yield is a robust predictive variable for market returns , in each subperiod and for each sampling frequency and forecasting horizon considered .",
    "in contrast , tests based on bias - corrections , local - to - unity asymptotics , or standard subsampling procedures provide more ambiguous findings , by not rejecting the null of no predictability in a number of cases .",
    "second , we find that the difference between option - implied volatility and realized volatility is a robust predictive variable of future market returns at quarterly forecasting horizons , both using robust and nonrobust testing methods .",
    "this finding confirms the remarkable return forecasting ability of the variance risk premium , first noticed in bollerslev , tauchen and zhou ( 2009 ) .",
    "third , we find that conventional testing approaches deliver an ambiguous evidence of return predictability by proxies of labor income , which is either absent or weak in the sample periods 1955 - 2000 and 1965 - 2010 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the null of no predictability is always clearly rejected using the robust testing approach , indicating that the weak findings of the conventional tests are likely deriving from their low ability to detect predictability structures in presence of small sets of anomalous observations .",
    "fourth , we exploit the properties of our robust tests to identify potential anomalous observations that might explain the diverging conclusions of robust and nonrobust methods .",
    "we find a fraction of less than about 5% of anomalous observations in the data , which tend to cluster during the nasdaq bubble and the more recent financal crisis .",
    "anomalous data points , including the lehman brothers default on september 2008 , the terrorist attack of september 2001 , the black monday on october 1987 , and the dot - com bubble collapse in august 2002 , are responsible for the failure of conventional testing methods in uncovering the hidden predictability structures for these sample periods .",
    "fifth , we find that the different conclusions of our robust approach with respect to conventional methods can not be explained by the presence of time - varying predictive regression parameters , as we do not find any evidence of structural breaks in predictive relations over our sample period .",
    "moreover , we find that the out - of - sample predictions for monthly market returns of our robust approach are more accurate than the ones given by conventional predictive regressions and sample mean market return forecasts .    finally ,",
    "while our subsampling tests have been developed in the context of standard predictive systems with autocorrelated regressors , our approach is extendable also to more general settings , including potential nonlinear predictive relations or unobserved state variables .",
    "for instance , van binsbergen and koijen ( 2010 ) propose a latent - variable approach and a kalman filter to estimate a present value model with hidden and persistent expected return and dividend growth , in order to formulate powerful tests for the joint predictability of stock returns and dividend growth .",
    "the application of our robust subsampling tests in the context of such present value models is an interesting avenue for future research .",
    "we first consider the subsampling .",
    "the value @xmath125 is the smallest fraction of outliers , that causes the breakdown of statistic @xmath58 in a block of size @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the first inequality is satisfied .    for the second inequality ,",
    "we denote by @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 , @xmath252 , the nonoverlapping and overlapping blocks of size @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "given the original sample @xmath52 , for the first nonoverlapping block @xmath253 , consider the following type of contamination : @xmath254 where @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 , @xmath258 , denote the noncontaminated and contaminated points , respectively . by construction , the first @xmath259 overlapping blocks @xmath260 , @xmath261 , contain @xmath262 outliers .",
    "consequently , @xmath263 , @xmath264 .",
    "assume that the first @xmath265 nonoverlapping blocks @xmath266 , @xmath267 , have the same contamination as in ( [ co ] ) . because of this contamination , the number of statistics @xmath268 which diverge to infinity is @xmath269 .",
    "consider @xmath266 , @xmath250 .",
    "assume that @xmath274 of these nonoverlapping blocks are contaminated with exactly @xmath275 outliers for each block , while the remaining @xmath276 are noncontaminated ( @xmath277 outlier ) , where @xmath118 and @xmath278 , @xmath279 .",
    "moreover , also assume that the contamination of the @xmath274 contaminated blocks has the structure defined in ( [ co ] ) .",
    "the block bootstrap constructs a @xmath55-sample randomly selecting with replacement @xmath280 overlapping blocks of size @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath281 be the random variable which denotes the number of contaminated blocks in the random bootstrap sample .",
    "it follows that @xmath282 .    by equation ( [ break2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath283 , when the proportion of statistics @xmath284 with @xmath285 is larger than @xmath272 .",
    "the smallest number of outliers such that @xmath285 is by definition @xmath286 .",
    "let @xmath287 . consequently ,",
    "@xmath288.\\ ] ] this concludes the proof of theorem [ bsubboot ] .",
    "since the estimating function @xmath145 is bounded , it turns out that @xmath289^{-1/2}[\\nabla_{\\theta}\\psi_{k}(z_{(k),i}^{\\ast},\\hat{\\theta}_{n}^r)]^{-1 } \\psi_{k}(z_{(k),i}^{\\ast},\\hat{\\theta}_{n}^r),\\ ] ] may degenerate only when ( i ) @xmath290 or ( ii ) @xmath291 .",
    "consider the function @xmath292 using some algebra , we can show that @xmath293 where @xmath294 denotes the @xmath295 null matrix .",
    "it turns out that by construction the matrix @xmath296 is semi - positive definite , and in particular @xmath297 , only when @xmath298 , for all the observations @xmath299 in the random sample @xmath300 .    for the original sample ,",
    "consider following type of contamination @xmath301 where @xmath255 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 and @xmath304 , @xmath305 , denote the noncontaminated and contaminated points , respectively , where @xmath306 .",
    "it turns out that all the @xmath307 overlapping blocks of size @xmath60 @xmath308 @xmath309 contain only outliers .",
    "therefore , for these @xmath307 blocks we have that @xmath310 , i.e. , some components of vector ( [ term ] ) may degenerate to infinity .",
    "moreover , @xmath311 when the proportion of statistics @xmath312 with @xmath313 is larger than @xmath272 . therefore , @xmath314 , which proves the result in equation ( [ fbps ] ) .    for the result in equation ( [ fbpb ] ) , note that because of the contamination defined in ( [ cof ] ) , by construction we have @xmath307 overlapping blocks of size @xmath60 with exactly @xmath60 outliers , and @xmath315 blocks with less than @xmath60 outliers .",
