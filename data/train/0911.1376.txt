    "filling a container by pouring in spherical grains nearly always leads to a disordered packing .",
    "the `` ground state '' of the system , a face - centered cubic packing and the densest arrangement of spheres , is rarely achieved unless put in by hand .",
    "shaking or tapping the container , causing the contents to settle and compact , works only so well : the packing remains disordered , and its packing density @xmath1 approaches but does not exceed the random close packing ( rcp ) density @xmath3 @xcite . despite being a robust state that is readily reproducible , little",
    "is known about the origins of random closed packing .",
    "surprisingly , the detailed arrangement of particles in rcp is remarkably similar to the molecular arrangements in a simple liquid @xcite ; but unlike a liquid , rcp is mechanically rigid and resists shear  it is jammed @xcite .",
    "the same combination of rigidity and disorder also characterizes structural glasses , such as window glass and hard candies . like rcp ,",
    "a glass is an elastic solid whose molecular arrangement is nearly indistinguishable from that of a liquid .",
    "indeed , the structure of simple metallic glasses are well - modelled by rcp @xcite . drawing on these similarities , liu and",
    "nagel proposed that jammed packing of particles and glass - formation in simple liquids may be placed into a unified jamming phase diagram spanned by inverse density @xmath4 , temperature @xmath5 , and shear stress  ( fig .",
    "[ jammingpd ] ) @xcite .",
    "the region of high density , low temperature , and small shear is occupied by jammed or glassy states ; the rest are filled by fluid states .",
    "jamming is the consolidation of loose grains into a rigid packing when @xmath1 is increased at @xmath6 , whereas the glass transition is the freezing of a liquid into a glassy solid at a finite @xmath5 .",
    "the principal aim of this work is to explore the relationship between jammed grains and glasses by adopting methods and principles from glass experiments to study granular materials , in an effort to identify shared features , as well as differences and new effects .",
    "it is attractive to think random closed packing and glasses , unsolved problems on their own , may in fact be closely connected .",
    "it also invites skepticism to think systems so different microscopically can exhibit close analogies .",
    "we are therefore encouraged to find that granular packing is not only glass - like in structure , it can also exhibit slow relaxations reminiscent of the low-@xmath5 dynamics of structural glasses , and of other `` glassy '' systems such as spin glasses and kinetically constrained computer models @xcite . for glass - forming liquids such as glycerol or viscous @xmath7 , small reductions in @xmath5 can lead to large ( and apparently diverging ) increases in the relaxation time ( and the fluid viscosity ) .",
    "below the glass transition temperature @xmath8 , the characteristic relaxation time of the liquid becomes greater than the experimental timescale : the liquid falls out of equilibrium and becomes a glass .",
    "because it is out of equilibrium , the properties of the glassy state are not stationary but depend on the experimental timescale ( aging ) and on the thermal history of the system ( memory ) . for a packing of macroscopic particles with strongly dissipative interactions ( friction ) ,",
    "thermal energy is unimportant , and the dynamical evolution of the system is driven by external energy input ( such as tapping or shaking ) .",
    "strongly shaken , a granular packing quickly reaches a loosely - packed steady state .",
    "weakly tapped , the packing compacts slowly in a logarithmic fashion with time , and the steady state may not be accessible on an experimental timescale ( fig .",
    "[ compactiondynamics ] ) ; furthermore , the detailed evolution depends on how the packing was prepared .",
    "one may therefore take the random packing of grains  despite its athermal , dissipative nature  to be a model `` glass '' , in terms both of structure and of dynamics .",
    "this raises the question whether there are shared physical principles connecting the various microscopically disparate systems commonly regarded as `` glassy '' .",
    "simply put : is a granular packing glassy in the same sense structural and/or spin glasses are glassy ? if there is a deep connection , then granular packings may be a convenient experimental system for investigating the origins of glassy behavior . here , i have developed a volumetric spectroscopy , modeled after the dielectric and magnetic spectroscopies of structural and spin glasses , to directly probe the spectrum of relaxation processes in granular compaction , with goal of ultimately comparing it , in detail , with the spectrum of glasses . because granular packing is an athermal system without a well - defined statistical mechanics , analogies with the behavior of glasses at finite @xmath5 can not be justified _ a priori_.",
    "i will adopt a purely operational approach : analogies will be proposed navely , and they will be justified solely on the light they may shed on the experimental data .    this paper is organized as follows :    section ii describes the volumetric spectroscopy and gives an operational definition for the `` susceptibility '' @xmath0 .",
    "i will then describe how the spectroscopy is performed , and @xmath0 measured , in a granular compaction experiment .",
    "section iii describes the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of the taping amplitude ( which is the principal control parameter for granular compaction ) and the frequency ( the dynamical spectrum ) . despite some similarities to the dielectric / magnetic susceptibilities of structural and spin glasses , @xmath0 is distinctive in exhibiting very weak aging .",
    "more surprisingly , there is no indication in the spectrum of @xmath0 of a diverging relaxation time as the tapping amplitude is turned down . comparing the compaction process with the dynamical spectrum",
    ", one finds that granular compaction is characterized by a broad separation of timescales .",
    "section iv suggest that the apparently distinctive behavior of @xmath0 may be generic to a complex configurational specific heat . in analogy to the well - known relationship between specific heat and energy fluctuations ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath2 and specific volume fluctuation is found to be consistent with an effective fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "furthermore , computer simulations of two standard spin glass models found the complex specific heat in these models appear to mirror the behavior of @xmath0 . if @xmath0 can indeed be taken as a `` specific heat '' , it suggest the slow dynamics of granular compaction is governed by statistically rare relaxation processes which become increasing decoupled from the typical dynamics of the system .",
    "section v describes how the system size affects the dynamics of granular compaction . for small systems , @xmath0 is suppressed within an intermediate frequency band and within an intermediate window of tapping amplitude ; this is consistent with the suppression of large - scale correlated motions in small systems . but for sufficiently weak driving ,",
    "the low - frequency responses of small systems are enhanced ; i suggest this is the consequence of particle / wall interactions at the boundary .    to conclude , in section vi , i will summarize the most salient results and briefly discuss their implications for understanding `` glassy '' dynamics .",
    "i will close by suggesting ways that this work can be extended to address several important open questions .",
    "the dynamics of structural and/or spin glasses is commonly studied via an appropriate spectroscopy . here , temperature @xmath5 is usually the principal parameter that controls whether the system is in the glassy state .",
    "having set the temperature , the dynamics of system is characterized by some susceptibility , which describes how the system responds to small perturbations .",
    "for example , the dielectric susceptibility @xmath9 , often used to characterize glass - forming liquids , describes the response of the net polarization @xmath10 when a small electric field @xmath11 is applied : @xmath12 .",
    "if the perturbation can be applied in a frequency - controlled way , e.g. with an ac electric field , a dynamical spectrum of response versus frequency can be obtained .",
    "such a spectrum will encode the relative distribution of relaxation times in the system .",
    "in a similar spirit , i will characterize granular compaction using a complex ( frequency - dependent ) volumetric `` susceptibility '' @xmath13 , which describes the response of the specific packing volume @xmath14 to small changes in the external driving ( tapping ) , and extract the dynamical spectrum of granular compaction .",
    "this should allow us to make a detailed comparison between the slow compaction of a granular packing and the low - temperature dynamics of structural and spin glasses .      in a typical compaction experiment ,",
    "a granular packing ( held inside a container ) is compacted with a sequence of identical taps , separated sufficiently apart so that the packing comes to a complete rest before being tapped again .",
    "each tap is one single period of sinusoidal ( 30 hz , in my case ) vertical vibration , and the tapping amplitude @xmath16 is given by the peak - to - peak acceleration @xmath17 of the tap , normalized by @xmath18 : @xmath19 . in order to extract a susceptibility ,",
    "the packing must be perturbed at the same time it is being tapped ; however , experimentally there is no readily accessible secondary field which can couple to the system .",
    "the solution here is to use tapping both as the principal control parameter and as the perturbing `` field '' . instead of a sequence of taps with identical amplitudes ,",
    "the tapping amplitude is modulated about a mean level [ fig  [ am](a ) ] , @xmath20 the mean amplitude @xmath21 serves as the principal control parameter , while the modulation amplitude @xmath22 serves as the perturbing `` field '' ; @xmath23 is the modulation frequency in inverse taps , and @xmath24 is time measured in the number of taps applied . in response to the modulated tapping , the temporal evolution of the specific packing volume @xmath14 can be described as the sum of a slowly varying component @xmath25 , and a frequency - locked component which is phase - shifted with respect to the input [ fig  [ am](b ) ] , @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the response magnitude , and @xmath28 is the phase shift between the modulated tapping and the volumetric response .",
    "one can then define the real and imaginary ( in- and out - of - phase ) parts of a complex susceptibility @xmath29 as @xmath30 this susceptibility @xmath15 describes how the specific volume @xmath31 responds to a small change in the tapping amplitude @xmath22 . for sufficiently weak perturbations ,",
    "the response should be linear , @xmath32 , and @xmath2 should be independent of the modulation aamplitude .    in practice ,",
    "the phase shift @xmath28 and the response amplitude @xmath27 are not separately extracted from the @xmath33 data . using the orthonormality of trigonometric functions ,",
    "@xmath13 can be directly extracted by projecting @xmath33 onto its in- and out - of - phase components ( with respect to the tapping modulation ) .",
    "once a @xmath33 time series has been collected , it is divided into time - blocks of length @xmath34 , synchronized to the tapping modulation . within each time - block , @xmath33 is discretely transformed to extract @xmath15 directly : @xmath35 @xmath36 formally , eqs .",
    "[ in_phase ] , [ out_phase ] are exact projections only if the background @xmath37 of @xmath33 is stationary .",
    "however , since @xmath37 is almost always slowly - varying on the timescale of @xmath34 , eqs .  [ in_phase ] , [ out_phase ] are excellent approximations .",
    "the experimental design here is partly modeled after that of ref  .",
    "i use a cylindrical packing whose height is much larger than its diameter in an effort suppress large scale convections during the compaction process .",
    "the cell is a smooth - walled cylindrical tube made of polycarbonate , 50 cm tall , with an inner diameter @xmath38 cm . for experiments ,",
    "the cell is filled with particles to a height of @xmath39 cm [ fig .  [ experiment](a ) ] . to minimize static build - up , the inside cell wall is coated with a hard conductive polymer coating ( agfa orgacon s103 , ito america corp . ,",
    "tempe , az ) .",
    "the cell is mounted on a computer - controlled electromechanical shaker , which is carefully leveled and set on a vibration - damping platform . to minimize unwanted lateral motions during tapping ,",
    "the experimental cell is braced to a stiff external framework with heavy - duty rubber bands .",
    "the particles used are spherical zirconium oxide / silica ceramic ( material density = @xmath40 ) particles ( glenn mills inc . , clifton , nj ) .",
    "compared to more commonly used glass beads , these are mechanically much tougher .",
    "they also have a much smoother surface , which minimizes abrasion on the cell and on the particles themselves .",
    "these features help to ensure good reproducibility over the course of very long experiments and millions of taps .",
    "particles of three different diameters were used : @xmath41 mm , 1.1 mm , and 1.8 mm , all with @xmath42 polydispersity . because air effects can significantly alter the compaction process @xcite , particularly when particles are small , once loaded the cell is sealed and evacuated to a pressure @xmath43 .    to measure the specific packing volume ,",
    "a photograph of the packing is taken after each tap using a computer - controlled digital camera running astro iidc ( outcast software , calgary , alberta ) .",
    "the cell is backlit with a uniform , bright light source .",
    "where the cell is filled with particles ( which are opaque ) , the image is completely dark . by fitting the intensity profile of the image to an error function",
    ", the location of the top surface of the packing can be found [ fig .",
    "[ experiment](b ) ] .",
    "this is then compared with known reference marks on the cell to extract the packing height , and hence , the packing volume .",
    "the absolute accuracy in the determination of @xmath31 is limited by the unevenness is the top surface and by the accuracy with which reference marks can be placed .",
    "these are compensated by the large fill height , which keeps the absolute uncertainty in @xmath31 to @xmath44 .",
    "the relative accuracy , which is what matters most here ( since the signal i seek consists of small changes about a slowly - varying background ) , is somewhat better ( @xmath45 ) due to the fact that image profiles can be tracked with sub - pixel resolution .",
    "compared to methods that measure the packing density locally , such as capacitance or @xmath46-ray absorption @xcite , the imaging technique measures the bulk average and therefore displays much less fluctuation from tap to tap .",
    "this is necessary in order to obtain a clean measurement of @xmath2 .    to ensure a fresh start at for each new experiment ,",
    "the packing is `` reset '' by tapping at @xmath47 for at least @xmath48 taps .",
    "the result is a reproducible loose packing that has achieved a steady - state , where all memory of its prior tapping history appears to be lost . unless noted otherwise , this is the loose - packed initial state i will use for each new experimental run",
    "the volumetric susceptibility @xmath13 depends on both @xmath21 , which is the principal control parameter , and on the modulation frequency @xmath23 .",
    "it should not depend on @xmath22 if one is in the linear response regime , i.e. @xmath32 . at low @xmath21 , where granular compaction exhibits glassy behavior , @xmath13 should in principle depend on the experimental timescale ( aging ) , and the previous history of the packing ( memory ) .",

    "the ideal transition between jammed and unjammed states at point @xmath194 is never explored , since any packing one produces experimentally is automatically jammed . because real particles have friction , instead of a single jamming point at rcp , there is a large configuration space of jammed states , with densities ranging from random loose packing ( rlp ) at @xmath196 up to @xmath197 .",

    "<S> the slow compaction of a gently tapped granular packing is reminiscent of the low - temperature dynamics of structural and spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> here , i probe the dynamical spectrum of granular compaction by measuring a complex ( frequency - dependent ) volumetric susceptibility @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> while the packing density @xmath1 displays glass - like slow relaxations ( aging ) and history - dependence ( memory ) at low tapping amplitudes , the susceptibility @xmath0 displays very weak aging effects , and its spectrum shows no sign of a rapidly growing timescale . </S>",
    "<S> these features place @xmath0 in sharp contrast to its dielectric and magnetic counterparts in structural and spin glasses ; instead , @xmath2 bears close similarities to the complex specific heat of spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> this , i suggest , indicates the glass - like dynamics in granular compaction are governed by statistically rare relaxation processes that become increasingly separated in timescale from the typical relaxations of the system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , i examine the effect of finite system size on the spectrum of compaction dynamics . starting from the ansatz that low frequency processes correspond to large scale particle rearrangements </S>",
    "<S> , i suggest the observed finite size effects are consistent with the suppression of large - scale collective rearrangements in small systems . </S>"
