    "as we know the light rays or photons would be deviated from their straight way when they pass close to the massive object such as black holes .",
    "this deflection of light rays is known as gravitational lensing .",
    "this gravitational lensing is one of the applications and results of general relativity @xcite and is used as an instrument in astrophysics , because it can help us to extract the information about stars . in 1924",
    "chwolson pointed out that when a star(source ) , a deflector(lens ) and an observer are perfectly aligned , a ring - shape image of the star appears which is called einstein ring. other studies have been led by klimov , liebes , refsdal and bourassa and kantowski @xcite .",
    "klimov investigated the lensing of galaxies by galaxies @xcite , but liebes studied the lensing of stars by stars and also stars by clusters in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "refsdal showed that the geometrical optics can be used for investigating the gravitational lenses properties and time delay resulting from it @xcite .",
    "the gravitational lensing has been presented in details in @xcite and reviewed by some papers ( see for examples @xcite-@xcite ) . at this stage ,",
    "the gravitational lensing is developed for weak field limit and could not describe some phenomena such as looping of light rays near the massive objects .",
    "hence , scientists started to study these phenomena from another point of view and they proposed gravitational lensing in a strong field limit . when the source is highly aligned with lens and the observer , one set of infinitive relativistic `` ghost '' images would be produce on each side of black hole .",
    "these images are produced when the light rays that pass very close to black hole , wind one or several times around the black hole before reaching to observer . at first",
    ", this phenomenon was proposed by darwin @xcite and revived in refs .",
    "darwin proposed a surprisingly easy formula for the positions of the relativistic images generated by a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "afterward several studies of null geodesics in strong gravitational fields have been led in literatures : a semi - analytical investigation about geodesics in kerr geometry has been made in @xcite , also the appearance of a black hole in front of a uniform background was studied in refs .",
    "recently , virbhadra and ellis formulated lensing in the `` strong field limit '' and obtain the position and magnification of these images for the schwarzschild black hole @xcite . in ref @xcite , by an alternative formulation , frittelli , kiling and newman attained an exact lens equation , integral expressions for its solutions , and compared their result with virbhadra and ellis .",
    "afterwards , the new method was proposed by bozza et al .",
    "in which they revisited the schwarzschild black hole lensing by retaining the first two leading order terms @xcite .",
    "this technic was used by eiroa , romero and torres to study a reissner - nordstrom black hole @xcite and petters to calculate relativistic effects on microlensing events @xcite .",
    "finally , the generalization of bozza s method for spherically symetric metric was developed in @xcite .",
    "bozza compared the image patterns for several interesting backgrounds and showed that by the separation of the first two relativistic images we can distinguish two different collapsed objects . further development for other black holes can be found in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "several interesting studeies are devoted to lensing by naked singularities @xcite , janis - newman - winicour metric @xcite and role of scaler field in gravitational lensing @xcite . in ref @xcite , virbhadra et al . have considered a static and circularly symmetric lens characterized by mass and scalar charge parameter and investigated the lensing for different values of charge parameter .",
    "+ the gravitational lenses are important tools for probing the universe .",
    "narasimha and chitre predicted that the gravitational lening of dark matter can give the useful data about of position of dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "also in some papers gravitational lens is used to detect exotic objects in the universe , such as cosmic strings @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ recently , the idea of large extra dimensions has attracted much attention to construct theories in which gravity is unified with other forces @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting problems is the verification of extra dimensions by physical phenomena . for this purpose",
    "higherdimensional black holes in accelerators @xcite and in cosmic rays @xcite-@xcite and gravitational waves from higher - dimensional black holes @xcite are studied . the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a chern- simons term predicted five - dimensional charged black holes @xcite .",
    "such a higher - dimensional black holes would reside in a spacetime that is approximately isotropic in the vicinity of the black holes , but effectively four - dimensional far from the black holes @xcite .",
    "these higher dimensional black holes are called kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "the presence of extra dimension is tested by quasinormal modes from the perturbation around the higher dimensional black hole @xcite-@xcite and the spectrum of hawking radiation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the gravitational lensing is another method to investigate the extra dimension .",
    "thus , the study of strong gravitational lensing by higher dimensional black hole can help us to extract information about the extra dimension in astronomical observations in the future .",
    "the kaluza - klein black holes with squashed horizon @xcite is one of the extra dimensional black holes and it s hawking radiation and quasinormal modes have been investigated in some papers @xcite-@xcite . also , the gravitational lensing of these black holes is studied in several papers .",
    "liu et al . have studied the gravitational lensing by squashed kaluza - klein black holes in refs @xcite and sadeghi et al .",
    "investigated the charged type of this black hole @xcite .",
    "+ one the other hands we know that our universe is rotational and it is reasonable to consider gdel background for our universe .",
    "an exact solution for rotative universe was obtained by gdel .",
    "he solved einstein equation with pressureless matter and negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the solutions representing the generalization of the gdel universe in the minimal five dimensional gauged supergravity are considered in many studies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the properties of various black holes in the gdel background are investigated in many works @xcite .",
    "the strong gravitational lensing in a squashed kaluza - klein black hole in a gdel universe is investigated in ref .",
    "+ in this paper , we tudy the strong gravitational lensing in a charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole . in that case",
    ", we see the effects of the scale of the extra dimension , charge of black hole and gdel parameter on the coefficients and observables of strong gravitational lensing .",
    "+ so , this paper is organized as follows : section 2 is briefly devoted to charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole background . in section 3",
    "we use the bozza s method @xcite to obtain the deflection angle and other parameters of strong gravitational lensing as well as variation of them with extra dimension , gdel parameter and charge of black hole . in section 4",
    ", we suppose that the supermassive object at the center of our galaxy can be considered by the metric of charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole .",
    "then , we evaluate the numerical results for the coefficients and observables in the strong gravitational lensing . in the last section",
    ", we present a summary of our work .",

    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mass and charge of the black hole respectively and @xmath11 is the parameter of gdel background .",
    "the killing horizon of the black hole is given by equation @xmath12 , where @xmath13[m - q-8j^2(m+q)^2]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + we see that the black hole has two horizons .",
    "as @xmath14 the horizon of the squashed kaluza- klein gdel black hole is recovered @xcite and when @xmath10 and @xmath11 tend to zero , we have @xmath15 , which is the horizon of five - dimensional schwarzschild black hole . here",
    "we note that the argument of square root constraints the mass , charge and gdel parameter values .",
    "when @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , which means that the squashing effect disappears and the five - dimensional charged black hole is recovered . + by using the transformations , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) can be written in the following form , @xmath21 @xmath22+\\rho_0[\\rho_0(\\rho_m+6\\rho_q)+7\\rho_m\\rho_q]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the outer and inner horizons of the black hole in the new coordinate and @xmath26 is a scale of transition from five - dimensional spacetime to an effective four - dimensional one . here @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 .",
    "the komar mass of black hole is related to @xmath29 with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the four dimensional gravitational constant . by using relations  ( [ horizon1 ] ) and  ( [ tranformations ] )",
    "we can obtain @xmath32 in the following coupled equations , @xmath33={a}(\\rho_{h+},\\rho_{h-}),\\nonumber\\\\ & & 2\\left[\\rho_0(\\rho_{h+}-\\rho_{h-})\\right]={b}(\\rho_{h+},\\rho_{h-}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 when @xmath35 , the horizon of black hole becomes @xmath36 , as obtained in @xcite . in case of @xmath35 and @xmath37",
    ", we have @xmath38 which is consistent with neutral squashed kaluza - klein black hole @xcite .",
    "you note that the square root in relation  ( [ ab ] ) constrains the values of @xmath26 , @xmath39 and @xmath11 . in the case",
    "@xmath40 , the permissive regime is shown in ref.@xcite . for any value of @xmath39 there",
    "is allowed rang for @xmath26 .",
    "hence these parameters can not select any value and when @xmath11 increases from zero , permissive regime for @xmath39 and @xmath26 becomes more confined .",
    "we solved the above coupled equations numerically and results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we see that the outer horizon of black hole increases with the size of extra dimension , @xmath26 and decreases with @xmath11 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that two horizons of black hole coincide in especial values of parameters , which in that case we have an extremal black hole .",
    "in this section , we are going to investigate the deflection angle of light rays when they pass close to a charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole .",
    "we also study the effect of the charge parameter @xmath39 , the scale of extra dimension @xmath26 and gdel parameter on the deflection angle and it s coefficients in the equatorial plane ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "+ in this plane , the squashed kaluza - klein gdel metric reduces to @xmath42 where @xmath43 the null geodesic equations are , @xmath44 where @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the tangent vector to the null geodesics and the dote denotes derivative with respect to affine parameter .",
    "we use equation ( [ geodesic ] ) and obtain the following equations , @xmath47 @xmath48.\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants of motion .",
    "also , the @xmath52-component of equation  ( [ geodesic ] ) in equatorial plane @xmath41 , is given by , @xmath53=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath54 , then deflection angle will be zero and this is illegal , so we set @xmath55 . by using equation  ( [ rhogeo ] )",

    "the analytical solution for the above equation is very complicated , so we calculated the equation ( [ phequ ] ) numerically .",
    "variations of r photon sphere radius are plotted with respect to the charge @xmath39 , the scale of extra dimension @xmath26 and gdel parameter in the figure 2 .",
    "also figure 3 shows variations of impact parameter in it s minimum value ( at radius of photon sphere ) .",
    "these figures show that by adding the charge to the black hole , the behavior of the photon sphere radius and minimum of impact parameter is different compare with the neutral black hole @xcite .",
    "as @xmath26 approaches to it s minimum values the radius of photon sphere and impact parameter become divergent .",
    "+ by using the chain derivative and equation ( [ rhogeo ] ) , the deflection angle in the charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole can be written as , @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 with @xmath63 when we decrease the @xmath59 ( and consequently @xmath64 ) the deflection angle increases . at some points , the deflection angle exceeds from @xmath65 so that the light ray will make a complete loop around the compact object before reaching at the observer . by decreasing @xmath59",
    "further , the photon will wind several times around the black hole before emerging .",
    "finally , for @xmath66 the deflection angle diverges and the photon is captured by the black hole .",
    "moreover , from equations ( [ iphi ] ) and ( [ ipsi ] ) , we can find that in the charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole , both of the deflection angles depend on the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath26 and @xmath39 , which implies that we could detect the rotation of universe , the extra dimension and charge of black hole in theory by gravitational lens .",
    "note that the @xmath67 depend on @xmath68 , not @xmath11 .",
    "it shows that the deflection angle is independent of the direction of rotation of universe .",
    "but , from equation ( [ ipsi ] ) we find that the integral @xmath69 contains the factor @xmath11 , then the deflection angle @xmath70 for the photon traveling around the lens in two opposite directions is different .the main reason is that the equatorial plan is parallel with gdel rotation plan @xcite .",
    "when @xmath11 vanishes , the deflection angle of @xmath71 tends zero @xcite .",
    "we focus on the deflection angle in the @xmath72 direction , + so we can rewrite the equation  ( [ iphi ] ) as , @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the function @xmath77 is regular for all values of @xmath78 and @xmath59 , while @xmath79 diverges as @xmath78 approaches to zero .",

    "as @xmath91 , @xmath88 approaches zero and divergence is of order @xmath92 , that makes the integral divergent .",
    "therefor , the deflection angle can be approximated in the following form @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94}{u_{ps}\\sqrt{\\mathcal{a}^3(\\rho_{ps})\\mathcal{c}(\\rho_{ps})}}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & b_r = i_r(\\rho_{ps}),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,u_{ps}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{c}(\\rho_{ps})}{\\mathcal{a}(\\rho_{ps})}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using  ( [ deflection ] ) and  ( [ a ] ) , we can investigate the properties of strong gravitational lensing in the charged squashed kaluza- klein gdel black hole .",

    "another observable for gravitational lensing is relative magnification of the outermost relativistic image with the other ones .",

    ", the deflection anglethe of the light rays which pass very close to the black hole , becomes so large that , it winds several times around the black hole before appearing at the observer .",
    "therefore the observer would detect two infinite set of faint relativistic images produced on each side of the black hole . on the other hand",
    "the extra dimension is one of the important predictions in the string theory which is believed to be a promising candidate for the unified theory .",
    "also it is reasonable to consider a rotative universe with global rotation .",
    "hence the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a chern- simons term in string theory predicted five - dimensional charged black holes in the gdel background . in our study , we considered the charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole spacetime and investigated the strong gravitational lensing by this metric .",
