    "<S> we propose a new scheme in which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the mssm sfermions by gut gauge interactions at the tree level . </S>",

    "<S> sfermion masses are flavour universal , thus solving the supersymmetric flavour problem . in the simplest so(10 ) embedding , the ratio of different sfermion masses is predicted and differs from msugra and other schemes , thus making this framework testable at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> gaugino masses are generated at the loop level but enhanced by model dependent factors .    </S>",
    "<S> low energy supersymmetry remains one of the most attractive candidates for physics beyond the electroweak scale . while the supersymmetrization of the standard model ( sm ) is more or less straightforward , the origin of supersymmetry breaking and the mechanism through which it propagates to the sm fields and their supersymmetric partners represents the main source of theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> several options have been proposed . among them </S>",
    "<S> are supergravity  @xcite , gauge mediation  @xcite , anomaly mediation  @xcite , gaugino mediation  @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a new option in which spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector at the tree level through gut ( so(10 ) ) gauge interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> tree level supersymmetry breaking is sometimes considered not to be viable because of two issues , the supertrace formula and the fact that gaugino masses , not being generated at the tree level , turn out to be suppressed compared to sfermion masses . both issues can be easily addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the supertrace formula constrains the total sfermion and the corresponding fermion total squared mass to be the same  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result holds at the tree level in a globally supersymmetric theory with renormalizable khler and traceless gauge generators , which is the case of the scheme we are going to consider . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly represents a problem if the only fermions in chiral superfields are the sm ones , as the experimental constraints rather require a significantly larger sfermion total squared mass .    </S>",
    "<S> this problem is evaded in effective supergravity because the soft terms arise from non - renormalizable contributions to the khler and in standard gauge mediation ( which we will sometimes call `` loop '' gauge mediation ) because the soft terms arise at the loop level . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> one ends up with a non - vanishing supertrace . in our scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the supertrace does vanish ( in the full theory at the gut scale ) , but the positive contribution from the mssm matter fields is automatically compensated by a negative contribution from heavier chiral superfields . in order for this to work , a sm - neutral gauge u(1 ) in addition to the sm hypercharge is needed to avoid a stronger implication of the supertrace formula , which requires the lightest squark in either the up or down sector not to be heavier than the corresponding lightest quark  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main features of our model arise from requiring that such an extra u(1 ) be part of a unified group .    </S>",
    "<S> the second issue has to do with gaugino masses . under the above hypotheses , </S>",
    "<S> gaugino masses can only arise at the loop level . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a potential problem when the sfermions are generated at the tree level because it gives rise to a hierarchy between gaugino and sfermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> given the experimental bounds on the gaugino masses , @xmath1 , the sfermion masses typically end up being quite heavy , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this would push the sfermions out of the lhc reach and would introduce a significant fine - tuning in the determination of the higgs mass , thus approaching the split - supersymmetry regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an early implementation of some of the ideas above was considered in that context  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see , such a large hierarchy between tree level sfermion and loop gaugino masses can be avoided in our scheme because of a combination of different effects .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will briefly present a simple example of tree level gauge mediation , leaving a more detailed and systematic investigation to further study .    before presenting the model , let us motivate its gauge structure and field content . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to identify the supersymmetry breaking messengers with heavy vector superfields corresponding to broken generators , @xmath3 , of a simple grand unified group , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> there , @xmath4 is a sm singlet superfield whose @xmath5-term breaks supersymmetry , @xmath6 ( the prime is there just for consistency with the notations used below ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath4 has to couple to the heavy vector @xmath7 associated to the broken generator @xmath3 , @xmath4 must belong to a non - trivial multiplet of the unified group . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 represents a generic mssm superfield . in the effective theory below @xmath9 , the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] induces a non - renormalizable contribution @xmath10 to the khler potential , analogous to the ones of effective supergravity , but flavour universal ( @xmath11 are the @xmath3-charges of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the vector mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> a sfermion mass @xmath14 is then generated . in the full theory at @xmath9 , on the other hand , everything takes place at the renormalizable level . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the sfermion masses arise because @xmath4 couples to the broken generator @xmath3 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> its @xmath5-term generates a non - vanishing vev for the corresponding @xmath15-term @xmath16 which in turn induces the soft mass @xmath17 for the sfermion @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is actually no dependence on the gauge coupling ( and @xmath3-charge normalization ) because the vector squared mass @xmath19 is also proportional to @xmath20 ( and two @xmath3-charges ) .    </S>",
    "<S> .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    such a scheme requires specific gauge structures and field contents . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the heavy vector field @xmath7 in fig .  [ fig : diagram ] must be a sm singlet , as @xmath4 is . </S>",
    "<S> then , su(5 ) does not provide viable candidates for the gauge messenger @xmath7 and the minimal option is identifying the broken generator with the su(5 ) singlet generator @xmath3 of so(10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as for the sm singlet @xmath4 whose @xmath5-term breaks supersymmetry , it must belong to a non - trivial so(10 ) multiplet such that @xmath4 has a non - vanishing charge under @xmath3 . limiting ourselves to representations with dimension @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> , the only possibility is that @xmath4 be the singlet component of a spinorial representation , @xmath22 or @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we also need a @xmath24 participating to so(10 ) breaking at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> at least two @xmath24 are then required , one getting a vev along the scalar component and the other along the @xmath5-term component . </S>",
    "<S> gauge invariance , in fact , prevents from using a single @xmath25 , with both @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important difference with respect to standard gauge mediation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the standard embedding of a whole mssm family into a 16 of so(10 ) would not work , as it would lead to negative sfermion masses for some of the sfermions . </S>",
    "<S> that is why we distribute the matter fields in three 16 and three 10 of so(10 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> having motivated some of its features , we now illustrate a minimal model satisfying the above requirements . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge group is so(10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the matter fields ( negative @xmath28-parity ) are three @xmath29 and three @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where the su(5 ) decomposition is also indicated . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry and so(10 ) breaking to su(5 ) are provided by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( positive @xmath28-parity ) , with @xmath36 @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15-term condition forces @xmath38 and the phases of all the vevs can be taken positive without loss of generality . </S>",
    "<S> the mssm up higgs @xmath39 is embedded in a @xmath40 of so(10 ) , while the down higgs @xmath41 is a mixture of the doublets in the 10 and the 16 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 parametrizes the mixing in the down higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that it is possible to generate such vevs , break su(5 ) to the sm , achieve doublet - triplet splitting and higgs mixing as above , and give mass to all the extra fields with an appropriate superpotential @xmath46 involving additional so(10 ) representations .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we are in the condition of calculating the sfermion masses induced by integrating out the heavy vector fields : @xmath47 in the normalization we use for @xmath3 , @xmath48 . in order to determine the @xmath3 charge of the sm fermions we need to specify their embedding in the matter fields @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we do that by first writing the most general @xmath28-parity conserving superpotential , except a possible mass term for the @xmath50 , as @xmath51 where @xmath52 does not involve the matter fields and takes care of the vevs , the doublet triplet splitting , and the higgs mixing , and @xmath53 contains non - renormalizable contributions to the superpotential needed in order to account for the measured ratios of down quark and charged lepton masses ( we will ignore such issue here ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now see that the vev of the 16 gives rise to the mass term @xmath54 , which makes the @xmath55 and @xmath56 heavy . </S>",
    "<S> only the mssm superfield content survives at the electroweak scale ( assuming the three singlets in the @xmath57 get mass e.g.  from non - renormalizable interactions with the @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the three mssm families turn out to be embedded in the three @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and in the three @xmath60 , with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then go back to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sfermions ] ) and obtain @xmath62 at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sfermions2 ] ) is quite general , as it only depends on the choice of the gauge group and on the embedding of the three mssm families in the @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we note a few interesting features of this result .    </S>",
    "<S> * all the sfermion masses turn out to be positive . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the negative @xmath3 charges ( which must be there as @xmath3 is traceless ) happen to be associated to the fields that get an heavy supersymmetric mass . * </S>",
    "<S> the sfermions masses are flavour universal , thus solving the supersymmetric flavour problem . </S>",
    "<S> * the sfermions masses belonging to the 10 and @xmath64 of su(5 ) are related by @xmath65 at the gut scale , a peculiar prediction that allows to distinguish this model from msugra , gauge mediation , and other models of supersymmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> note also that the up higgs squared mass is negative to start with , whereas @xmath66 is positive for @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the negative value of the up higgs squared mass means that the electroweak symmetry is broken at the tree level and the usual radiative breaking mechanism is not needed . in the presence of negative higgs squared masses at the gut scale , there is the potential risk that the higgs potential develops a deep minimum along its flat direction @xmath68 , if @xmath69 at the gut scale or below . </S>",
    "<S> of course , a negative value of @xmath70 ( and/or @xmath66 ) does not necessarily mean that the above condition is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in most of the parameter space , the presence of a local electroweak symmetry breaking minimum at low energy ( which requires @xmath71 around the weak scale ) guarantees that no deeper minima develop at higher scales .    in passing , </S>",
    "<S> the sm fermion masses are given ( at the renormalizable level and before running the yukawas to low energy ) , by @xmath72 despite the so(10 ) structure , the up quark matrix is not correlated to the down quark and charged lepton masses , which allows to accommodate the stronger mass hierarchy observed in the up quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the heavy @xmath55 and @xmath56 mass matrix , @xmath73 , turns out to be proportional to the charged lepton mass matrix , up to non - renormalizable corrections from @xmath53 . in the context of type - ii </S>",
    "<S> see - saw , this can lead to a predictive model of leptogenesis  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> while the tree - level prediction for the sfermion masses , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sfermions2 ] ) , only depends on the choice of the unified gauge group and the mssm embedding , gaugino masses arise at one loop , as in standard gauge mediation , and depend on the superpotential parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral multiplets @xmath55 and @xmath56 get an heavy supersymmetric mass @xmath73 and their scalar components get a supersymmetry breaking mass @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> they play the role of three pairs of chiral messengers in standard gauge mediation and give rise to one loop gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of each messenger arises at a different scale . in the one loop approximation for the rge running </S>",
    "<S> , the total gaugino masses at lower scales can be calculated by running effective gut - scale gaugino masses given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the unified coupling . a possible contribution from loops involving the heavy vectors </S>",
    "<S> vanishes ( at the @xmath77 level ) in this simple model </S>",
    "<S> . the sfermion masses also get the usual two - loop contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us compare gaugino and sfermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting is the ratio @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath79-ino mass @xmath80 is at present bounded to be heavier than about @xmath81 , while @xmath82 enters the radiative corrections to the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ratio @xmath78 should not be too large in order not to increase the fine - tuning and not to push the stops and the other sfermions out of the lhc reach . </S>",
    "<S> from @xmath83 we see first of all that the loop factor separating @xmath82 and @xmath80 is partially compensated by a combination of numerical factors : @xmath84 ( leading to @xmath85 for @xmath86 ) becomes @xmath87 ( leading to @xmath88 for @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the factor @xmath89 is related to the ratio of @xmath3 charges in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sfermions ] ) and the factor @xmath90 corresponds to the number of families ( @xmath91 for @xmath92 ) . a largish value of the factor @xmath93 </S>",
    "<S> can then further reduce the hierarchy and even make @xmath94 , if needed . both @xmath95 and large values of @xmath93 </S>",
    "<S> are in fact not difficult to obtain depending on the overall size and flavour structure of @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( we remind that @xmath96 is related to the down quark yukawa matrix and has a hierarchical structure , with two eigenvalues certainly small and the third one , related to the bottom yukawa , also allowed to be small , depending on @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> reducing the hierarchy between gaugino and sfermion masses correspondingly reduces the hierarchy between the two - loop contributions to sfermion masses from standard gauge mediation and the tree level values in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sfermions ] ) . to quantify the relative importance of the two contributions , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the basis in the messenger flavour space in which the matrix @xmath96 is diagonal and positive , the limit in which @xmath97 is also diagonal in that basis , and let us call @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath31 their eigenvalues . neglecting the running between the gut scale and the mass of the relevant messengers . </S>",
    "<S> if the most relevant messenger is the third family one , the effect of the running that we are neglecting is not too large . </S>",
    "<S> the third family messenger mass is in fact given by @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is the bottom mass , @xmath104 ) , not too far ( in logarithmic scale ) from @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> still , we expect the messengers to be lighter enough than the gut scale in such a way that only the sm casimirs ( and not the gut ones ) are relevant . ] , the sfermion masses are given , at the high scale , by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the tree level value given in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sfermions2],[eq : higgses ] ) and @xmath108 is the total sm quadratic casimir of the sfermion @xmath18 ( or higgs @xmath8):@xmath109 if the contribution of a single messenger dominates gaugino masses , @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> in the numerical example we will consider , the relative size of the two loop contribution to sfermion masses ranges from 2% to 10% .    </S>",
    "<S> additional , subleading contributions to sfermion masses can arise from different sources . </S>",
    "<S> one - loop contributions from an induced u(1)@xmath111 fayet - iliopoulos term  @xcite only arise if @xmath97 is non - diagonal in the basis where @xmath96 is diagonal and @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they are suppressed ( typically negligible ) because u(1)@xmath111 is broken above the scale of the loop messengers . </S>",
    "<S> another contribution could come from gravity effects . since in our scenario the messenger scale </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be around the gut scale , the gravity mediated contribution to the spectrum , although subleading , could be relevant for flavour physics , as it could in principle be strongly flavour violating . in order to quantify this effect , let us assume that the gravity contribution to an arbitrary entry of the squared mass matrix of the sfermions in the 10 of su(5 ) is given by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the reduced planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> the conservative bound @xmath115 , which guarantees that all fcnc effects are under control , then translates in the following bound on the messenger scale : @xmath116 if the messenger scale is higher , we are in a hybrid framework from the flavour point of view  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , another potentially relevant source of flavour non - universality might come from one loop contributions to sfermion masses arising from the superpotential yukawa interactions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) , once the ( necessary ) presence of mass terms for the components of the 16 and @xmath117 are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> such effects are certainly under control if the matrix @xmath97 , as @xmath96 , has a hierarchical structure and is approximately aligned to @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the @xmath118-terms . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are generated at one loop by the yukawa interactions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) , with no contribution from gauge interactions . assuming for simplicity that the matrices @xmath97 and @xmath119 are diagonal in the same basis in which @xmath96 is , we have [ eq : aterms ] @xmath120 at the messenger scale . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath118-terms above are defined in such away that they give rise to soft trilinear terms in the lagrangian in the form @xmath121 . by comparing with the expression for the gaugino masses , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that only the @xmath118-terms of the third family have a chance to be sizable at the messenger scale , unless the @xmath97 matrix is not hierarchical . within the simplified diagonal flavour structure we are considering </S>",
    "<S> , we can compare the @xmath118-terms in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : aterms ] ) with the gaugino masses in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gauginos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gaugino masses are in this case proportional to @xmath122 . depending on which of the three terms dominates in the sum </S>",
    "<S> , the largest @xmath118-terms can be comparable or smaller than the gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> the ( necessary ) presence of mass terms for the components of the 16 and 16 can generate additional , model - dependent , contributions . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , sizable contributions to the @xmath118-terms will be generated as usual by the rge evolution proportional to the gaugino masses .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we comment on the @xmath123 problem . </S>",
    "<S> relating the @xmath123-term to supersymmetry breaking is , not surprisingly , a highly model - dependent issue , due to the various possibilities of implementing supersymmetry breaking and embedding the higgs fields in so(10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we point out , however , a simple possibility in which both the @xmath5-term , @xmath6 and @xmath123 originate from the same parameter @xmath124 in the superpotential : @xmath125 .    </S>",
