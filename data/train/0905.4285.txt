    "while the standard weak - coupling treatment of the boltzmann equation yields a resistivity @xmath143 in @xmath20-@xmath21 clean systems as mentioned above , it is conceivable that in a strongly correlated electron system mode - mode coupling effects mix the various time scales and lead to a single relaxation time .",
    "it is currently not known whether this hypothesis is correct , or what it takes at a technical level to demonstrate it , but it provides a possible mechanism for producing an electrical resistivity that is linear in @xmath26 in @xmath20-@xmath21 or quasi-@xmath20-@xmath21 systems ."

    "<S> the goldstone mode due to stripe or unidirectional charge - density - wave order in electron systems is found to have the same functional form as the one in classical smectic liquid crystals . </S>",
    "<S> it is very similar to the goldstone mode that results from helical magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for an effective theory that provides a quasiparticle description of either stripe phases or helimagnets in the low - energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable observable consequence is an electronic relaxation rate in @xmath0 that is @xmath1 in clean systems and @xmath2 in weakly disordered ones . </S>",
