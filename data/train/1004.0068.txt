    "this is in contrast to the collision of conventional gauge strings where upon collision they exchange partners and intercommute with the probability close to unity .",

    "in this work we have studied the cosmic strings collision in cosmological backgrounds . after presenting the general formalism in section [ formalism ] we have concentrated to the example of colliding loops .",
    "the motivation for this work was to understand analytically the findings of simulation in @xcite where it was found that there were little contributions from the bound states strings in their multiple strings network .",
    "one can understand this phenomena as follows .",
    "for the junctions to develop upon strings collision , some appropriate initial conditions should be satisfied .",
    "these depends on the relative tensions of the colliding strings , the angle of collision and their relative velocities .",
    "yet the more interesting observation is that even when junctions are created , they can not grow indefinitely and the bound state strings start to unzip .",
    "as described in @xcite , for straight cosmic strings at collision the junctions do not unzip once they are materialized .",
    "however , for colliding loops in a flat background the zipping and unzipping generically happen @xcite .",
    "the natural question is how sensitive are these results to the expansion of the universe . here",
    "we find some interesting results indicating that the background expansion plays important roles in strings zipping , unzipping and their eventual disentanglement .",
    "the key parameter here is the relative size of the loops compared to the hubble expansion rate at the time of collision . for large super - horizon size loops",
    "one may approximate them with straight strings .",
    "this implies that if junctions are formed upon loops collision it will grow initially as in straight strings examples .",
    "however , as the universe expands the loops stretch conformally until they re - enter the horizon .",
    "meanwhile their velocities reduces rapidly .",
    "the net effect is that the rate of bound state strings creation slows down until it starts to unzip .",
    "eventually the loops disentangle from each other and pass by from each other in opposite directions if they did not shrink to zero by then . on the other hand , for small sub - horizon size loops one can neglect the effects of the expansion and the results of @xcite holds true . the case of colliding loops with the sizes comparable to the hubble radius at the time of collision",
    "is more non - trivial which shares some features with small and large loops cases .",
    "our numerical investigations also show that the junction formation and the zipping and unzipping phenomena are sensitive to the angle of collision @xmath88 and the strings relative tensions parametrized by @xmath99",
    ". it would be interesting to study these phenomena in the multi parameter space of @xmath190 and @xmath88 . also to simplify the analysis ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the example of coplanar colliding loops with equal tensions and radii .",
    "it would be interesting to study the general case where the loops have different sizes and orientations and there are hierarchies between the sizes of the loops and the hubble expansion rate at the time of collision .",
