    "quantum transport in disordered systems governs a host of fundamental physical processes including the efficiency of light harvesting systems , organic photovoltaics , conducting polymers , and j - aggregate thin films  @xcite .",
    "however , our theoretical understanding of these processes is still lacking in many cases . at the most basic level",
    ", one may describe the energy transport as a quantum diffusion process occurring in a system that is influenced by both static disorder and thermal fluctuations .",
    "theories based on fgr , i.e.  the marcus or frster rate expressions , are often used to study the transport properties of disordered organic systems , but only in very few cases , such as the transport in organic crystals , do the dynamics reside in a regime that is amenable to perturbative treatments  @xcite .",
    "more commonly , the coupling between the excitonic system and the environment is neither large nor small so that these perturbative treatments often yield qualitatively incorrect results .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of biological light harvesting complexes which are among the most efficient energy transporting systems currently known .",
    "recently , the haken - strobl model  @xcite and an approximate stochastic schrdinger equation  @xcite have been used to study the energy transport processes in one - dimensional disordered systems . however , the haken - strobl model represents a vast simplification of the true dynamics that is applicable only in the high temperature markovian limit , while the approximate stochastic schrdinger equation is only valid in the weak system - phonon coupling regime and fails to correctly reproduce the classical hopping dynamics at high temperature . here",
    "we present a complete characterization of the transport properties over the entire range of phonon bath parameters through the development of an efficient and accurate polaron - transformed redfield master equation ( ptre ) .",
    "in contrast to many standard perturbative treatments , the ptre   allows one to treat systems that are strongly coupled to the phonon baths .",
    "furthermore , the ptre  is still very accurate even if the system and bath are not strongly coupled provided that the bath relaxation time is sufficiently short  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to explore many interesting features of the dynamics that were previously inaccessible .    in the high temperature , incoherent regime , we recover the known scaling relations of hopping transport that are obtained from fgr .",
    "if the bath relaxation time is fast , then the diffusion constant , @xmath0 , decreases with temperature as @xmath1 as was found in the previous haken - strobl analysis .",
    "however , as the bath relaxation time slows , the fgr reduces to the marcus rates , and the temperature scaling of the diffusion constant transitions to @xmath2 . however , these relations hold only in the high - temperature / strong - coupling limit where the dynamics is incoherent . as the temperature or system - bath coupling decreases , quantum coherence begins to play a role and",
    "the fgr results quickly break down , leading to a significant underestimation of the true transport rate . in the sufficiently weak damping regime ,",
    "the ptre  results reduce to those of band - like transport governed by the standard secular redfield equation ( sre ) , wherein the diffusion coefficient can be shown to increase linearly with the system - phonon coupling strength .",
    "the sre rates also demonstrate that transport occurs even at zero temperature provided that the system - phonon coupling is finite , due to the dephasing interactions from the phonon bath .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the ptre   used to compute the diffusion coefficient in an infinite , disordered one - dimensional chain in sec .",
    "[ section : theory ] . in the following sec .",
    "[ section : results ] , the numerical results are presented and compared with the results from standard sre and fgr approaches in the weak and strong coupling regimes , respectively .",
    "the limiting results allow for the accurate determination of the respective scaling relations of the diffusion coefficient in each case .",
    "the ptre  is used to study some common organic semiconductor materials in sec .",

    "the total hamiltonian in the open quantum system formalism is given by @xmath3 where the three terms represent hamiltonians of the system , the phonon bath , and system - bath coupling , respectively .",
    "the system is described by a tight binding , anderson hamiltonian @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the site basis and @xmath6 is the electronic coupling between site @xmath7 and site @xmath8 .",
    "here we only consider one dimensional systems with nearest - neighbor coupling such that @xmath9 .",
    "the static disorder is introduced by taking the site energies , @xmath10 , to be independent , identically distributed gaussian random variables characterized by their variance @xmath11 .",
    "the overline is used throughout to denote the average over static disorder .",
    "we assume that each site is independently coupled to its own phonon bath in the local basis .",
    "thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15(@xmath16 ) are the frequency and the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the @xmath17-th mode of the bath attached to site @xmath8 with coupling strength @xmath18 , respectively .    applying the polaron method to study the dynamics of open quantum systems",
    "was first proposed by grover and silbey  @xcite .",
    "this approach has gained a renewed attention due to the recent interest in light harvesting systems  @xcite and has recently been extended to study non - equilibrium quantum transport  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will use a variant of the polaron based master equation which has the same structure as the popular redfield equation . in the polaron technique ,",
    "the unitary transformation operator , @xmath19 , is applied to the total hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the electronic coupling is renormalized by a constant , @xmath24 } $ ] , with the inverse thermal energy @xmath25 .",
    "the bath coupling operator now becomes @xmath26 , and is constructed such that its thermal average is zero , i.e. @xmath27=0 $ ] .",
    "additionally , we assume the coupling constants are identical across all sites @xmath28 and a super - ohmic spectral density , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dissipation strength and @xmath31 is the cut - off frequency .",
    "a detailed derivation of ptre  is given in appendix a , here we only summarize the main results .",
    "a perturbation approximation is applied in terms of the transformed system - bath coupling leading to a ptre  for the transformed reduced density matrix , @xmath32 : @xmath33 where the markov and secular approximations have also been employed .",
    "the greek indices denote the eigenstates of the polaron transformed system hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the redfield tensor , @xmath36 , describes the phonon - induced relaxation and can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the half - fourier transform of the bath correlation function @xmath39 and @xmath40/   \\mbox{tr}_{\\rm b}[\\mbox{e}^{-\\beta h_{\\rm b}}]$ ] .",
    "since the system is disordered and we are mainly interested in the long time dynamics , the markov and secular approximations do not incur a significant loss of accuracy .",
    "comparison of the dynamics computed with and without these approximations shows little discrepancy ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it should be noted that the transformed reduced density matrix , @xmath32 , is different from the reduced density matrix in the original frame , @xmath41 .",
    "however , for the transport properties studied here , only the population dynamics is needed which is invariant under the polaron transformation since @xmath42 .    _",
    "diffusion _ - in the presence of both disorder and dissipation , we find empirically that after an initial transient time that is approximately proportional to @xmath43 , the mean square displacement , @xmath44 , grows linearly with time , where the origin is defined such that @xmath45 .",
    "the diffusion constant , @xmath0 , can then be defined as @xmath46 .",
    "the electronic coupling @xmath47 sets the energy scale and quantities throughout are implicitly stated in units of @xmath48 . in the numerical simulations , we use a one - dimensional chain of 250 - 300 sites and average over 100 - 500 realizations of static disorder sampled from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath49 .",
    "the number of realizations needed for convergence is highly dependent on the temperature ; more samples are needed in the low temperature regime .",
    "we first investigate the effect of the dissipation strength , @xmath30 , on the diffusion constant in .",
    "a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath30 is observed , consistent with the previous studies using the haken - strobl model  @xcite . without coupling to the bath",
    ", there is no macroscopic transport since all the wavefunctions in the one - dimensional disordered system are anderson localized . introducing dissipation destroys the phase coherence that gives rise to localization , allowing for transport to occur .",
    "therefore in the weak coupling regime , increasing @xmath30 leads to faster transport as is readily apparent from the sre rates in , and thus @xmath0 increases linearly with @xmath30 . in the opposite regime of strong coupling , the coherence generated between sites is quickly destroyed and the quantum transport reduces to a classical hopping dynamics between neighboring sites . in this regime ,",
    "the dissipation strength effectively acts as classical friction that impedes the transport  @xcite leading @xmath0 to behave as a decreasing function of @xmath30 as is observed in .",
    "the interplay between static disorder and dissipation thus gives rise to an optimal dissipation strength for transport . in ( a )",
    ", it is seen that the maximal diffusive rate both increases and shifts to smaller coupling strengths as the temperature increases since thermal fluctuations also assist the quantum system to overcome the localization barriers in the weak coupling regime .",
    "for comparison , we also include the results from the sre in the weak coupling regime . for small @xmath30 and @xmath50 , the sre provides a reliable description of the transport properties , but starts to breakdown as @xmath30 ( or @xmath50 ) increases leading to an unphysical @xmath51 dependence .",
    "the breakdown of the sre has been discussed by ishizaki and fleming for a two - site model  @xcite and by wu _",
    "et al . _ for fmo  @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) depicts @xmath0 as a function of @xmath30 for different bath cut - off frequencies .",
    "it is found that the large @xmath30 scaling of @xmath0 is highly dependent on the relaxation time of the bath . for a fast bath ,",
    "the rates decrease approximately as @xmath52 consistent with our previous analysis of the haken - strobl model  @xcite .",
    "however , as the bath frequency decreases , a transition from the @xmath52 dependence to @xmath53 dependence is observed .",
    "this can be rationalized by noting that in the high temperature and strong damping regime , the dynamics are incoherent and can be described by classical hopping between nearest neighbors .",
    "then the hopping rate between sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 is accurately determined from fgr : @xmath54 ,      \\label{eqn : fermi}\\ ] ] and @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the activation barrier , and @xmath6 is the electronic coupling . in the slow bath limit the above expression reduces to the marcus rate @xmath57 which captures the correct @xmath58 dependence of the rate . defining the energy transfer time as the inverse of the rate , @xmath59 ,",
    "static disorder can be introduced by averaging @xmath60 over the gaussian distribution of static disorder : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the disorder - averaged golden rule rate can then be obtained using @xmath64 and is plotted in ( b ) . while it is seen to capture the correct scaling of @xmath0 in the overdamped regime",
    ", it significantly underestimates the transport in the small and intermediate damping regimes .",
    "as the dynamics becomes more coherent , the classical hopping rate between sites provides a qualitatively incorrect description of the transport . in the sufficiently weak dephasing regime",
    ", the dynamics from the ptre  reduce to those of the standard sre ( dashed lines in ( b ) ) .",
    "while the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath0 provides many physical insights , the temperature dependence is more experimentally accessible , and is presented in . similar to the @xmath30 dependence",
    ", @xmath0 exhibits a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath50 and the high @xmath50 scaling is sensitive to the cut - off frequency of the bath , as shown in ( b ) . at high temperature ,",
    "we observe @xmath0 decreases as @xmath65 for a slow bath as predicted by the marcus theory , while for a fast bath , we recover the haken - strobl scaling of @xmath66 .",
    "the system - bath coupling strengths shown in ( a ) lie to the right of the maxima in . hence @xmath0 decreases as @xmath30 increases in the high temperature regime . in the opposite low temperature regime ,",
    "the intermediate coupling results shown in ( a ) are beyond the reach of the sre .",
    "thus @xmath0 does not increase at a rate proportional to @xmath30 as might be expected .",
    "however , the results here also do not agree with the marcus formula where one would expect the transport rate to decrease as @xmath58 , but instead the diffusion constants are nearly independent of @xmath30 .",
    "this low temperature , intermediate coupling regime is not adequately described by either of the perturbative methods . at zero temperature , quantum fluctuations from the thermal environment",
    "are still present to destroy the anderson localization and allow for transport to occur , albeit at a very slow rate .",
    "this leads to a small but finite value of @xmath0 as seen in the inset of ( a ) .",
    "in addition to the steady state transport properties , it is also useful to explore the dynamics of noisy , disordered systems . displays the average population probability distribution at high and low temperatures for an initial excitation located at the center of the disordered chain .",
    "the temperatures are selected such that the diffusion constants in ( a ) and ( b ) are approximately the same , @xmath67 . in the high temperature case ,",
    "the coherence is quickly destroyed by dissipation , no wavelike motion is observed in the time scale plotted .",
    "while the population distribution appears exponential at short times which is a signature of anderson localization the exponential behavior quickly transitions to a gaussian profile indicating the onset of the diffusive regime .",
    "the population dynamics at low temperature in ( b ) is qualitatively different . at short times , the distribution near the center of the chain ( ( c ) ) displays wavelike motion characteristic of free - particle dynamics while the tails decay exponentially .",
    "the wavelike motion disappears at intermediate times but the localization peak near the center persists .",
    "although the exponential tail eventually disappears , the transition of the population distribution to a gaussian form is slow and takes place long after a reliable estimate of @xmath0 can been obtained @xmath68 , as shown in inset of the ( d ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare estimates of the transport properties in real material systems from the ptre  with the approximate fgr and sre rates that are often assumed to hold .",
    "for example , predictions of the charge mobility , @xmath69 , of several commonly used organic semiconductors are presented in .",
    "the parameters are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and we use the directions with the largest electronic couplings . despite using a vastly simplified model , the mobility calculated with the ptre  is in reasonable agreement with the available experimental values , while the sre usually leads to an substantial overestimation of the mobility and the commonly used fgr generally leads to a significant underestimation because of the neglect of quantum coherence .",
    "we have developed a polaron - transformed redfield equation to systematically study the transport properties of disordered systems in the presence of quantum phonon modes , and established scaling relations for the diffusion coefficients at both limits of the temperature and system - bath coupling strength .",
    "the results presented here constitute one of the first studies of quantum transport in extended disordered systems over the complete range of phonon bath parameters .",
    "the ptre  provides a general framework to establish a unified understanding of the transport properties of a wide variety of systems including light - harvesting complexes , organic photovoltaics , conducting polymers and j - aggregate thin films .",

    "@xcite has shown that the error incurred due to the initial condition is only significant at short times . in this work , we are mainly interested in the long time dynamics of the system .",

    "second , has the same structure as the redfield equation commonly used in the magnetic resonance literature .",
    "the only difference is that the damping tensor @xmath111 contains four summations as opposed to two summations in the standard redfield equation .",
