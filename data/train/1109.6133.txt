    "several microscopic theories point out that the phenomenon of superfluidity in liquid @xmath2he has to be seen as a consequence of bose - einstein condensation ( bec).@xcite having total spin @xmath7 , @xmath2he atoms behave like bosons and , below the critical temperature @xmath8 , they can occupy macroscopically the same single - particle state .",
    "nevertheless , the strong interaction between @xmath2he atoms does not allow all of them to occupy the lowest energy state and , even at zero temperature , only a small fraction @xmath9 of the @xmath10 particles is in the condensate .",
    "the macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state , in a strongly correlated system like @xmath2he , appears in the momentum distribution @xmath11 as a delta - peak at @xmath12 and a divergent behavior @xmath13 when @xmath14 . in the coordinate space",
    ", the presence of bec in a homogeneous system can be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of the one - body density matrix @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , which is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath11 .",
    "experimental estimates of @xmath1 can be obtained from the dynamic structure factor , @xmath17 , measured by neutron inelastic scattering at high energy and momentum transfer .",
    "these measurements have a long history:@xcite in the 80s , the first experiments gave estimates for @xmath1 slightly above 10% , but they were affected by a poor instrumental resolution and by some difficulties in describing the final states effects of the scattering experiment .",
    "recently , with the advances in the experimental technology and in the method of analysis of the scattering data , glyde _",

    "it is necessary the use of microscopic simulations to provide accurate estimations of the condensate fraction . in particular ,",
    "the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method has been widely used in the study of @xmath2he at finite temperature , thanks to its capability of furnishing in principle exact numerical estimates of physical observables relying only on the hamiltonian of the system.@xcite the first calculations of @xmath1 with this method date back to 1987,@xcite but most recent simulations based on an improved sampling algorithm provide very accurate results for @xmath0 , showing a condensate fraction @xmath20 at temperature @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite at zero temperature , ground - state projection techniques are widely used in the study of bec properties of @xmath2he .",
    "diffusion monte carlo technique , for instance , has provided estimations of @xmath1 in liquid @xmath2he on a wide range of pressures.@xcite this method , however , suffers from the choice of a variational ansatz necessary for the importance sampling whose influence on @xmath0 can not be completely removed .",
    "reptation quantum monte carlo ( rqmc ) has also been used for this purpose,@xcite but the calculated value of @xmath1 at svp lies somewhat below the recent pimc value @xcite at @xmath22 noted above .",
    "motivated by recent accurate experimental data on @xmath23 , our aim in the present work is to perform new calculations of @xmath0 and of @xmath1 in liquid @xmath2he at zero temperature using a completely model - independent technique based on path integral formalism .",

    "we fit our numerical data for @xmath0 with the model used in previous experimental works , @xcite highlighting the merits and the faults of this model , and finally we give our estimations for the condensate fraction when changing the pressure of the liquid , showing an excellent agreement with experimental data.@xcite    the pigs method and the computational details of our simulation are discussed in sec .",

    "the pigs approach to the study of quantum systems consists in a systematic improvement of a trial wave function @xmath24 by repeated application of the evolution operator in imaginary time , which eventually drives the system into the ground state,@xcite according to the formula @xmath25 where the @xmath26 represent different sets of coordinates the @xmath10 particles of the system , and @xmath27 is the imaginary time propagator .    given an approximation of @xmath28 for small @xmath29 , the averages of diagonal observables can be calculated mapping the quantum many - body system onto a classical system made up of @xmath10 interacting polymers composed by @xmath30 beads , each of them representing a different evolution in imaginary time of the initial trial state @xmath24 . increasing the number @xmath31 ,",
    "one is able to reduce the systematic error and therefore to recover  exactly  the ground - state properties of the system .",
    "a good approximation for the propagator @xmath32 is important for improving the numerical efficiency of the method : this greatly reduces the complexity of the calculation and ergodicity issues , allowing to simulate the quantum system with few beads , each one with a large time step . using a high - order approximation for the propagator , it is possible to obtain an accurate description of the exact ground state wave function with little numeric effort , even when the initial trial wave function contains no more information than the bosonic statistics , that is when one starts the imaginary time evolution from @xmath33.@xcite    the one - body density matrix can be written as @xmath34 differs from @xmath35 only by the position of one of the @xmath10 atoms . in the pigs approach , the expectation value of non - diagonal observables , like @xmath36 , is computed mapping the quantum system in the same classical system of polymers as in the diagonal case , but cutting one of these polymers in the mid point . building the histogram of the frequencies of the distances between the cut extremities of the two half polymers",

    "the calculation of the normalization factor at the denominator is not strictly necessary since the histogram can be normalized imposing the condition @xmath37 .",

    ", we have avoided this problem incorporating in the sampling the worm algorithm ( wa ) , a technique previously developed for path integral monte carlo simulations at finite temperature.@xcite the key aspect of wa is to work in an extended configuration space , containing both diagonal ( all polymers with the same length ) and off - diagonal ( one polymer cut in two separate halves ) configurations , and one of its main advantages is its capability of evaluating the normalization factor in off - diagonal estimators .",
    "we have extended this technique to zero - temperature calculations and we have been able to get automatically the properly normalized @xmath36 , and therefore very precise estimations of @xmath1 . in our simulations , the sampling also contains movements involving the principle of indistinguishability of quantum particles , like the _ swap _ update @xcite",
    ". even though swaps are not strictly necessary since boson symmetry is fulfilled with a proper choice of the imaginary time propagator , they improve the sampling allowing a larger displacement of the half polymers and thus a better exploration of the long range limit of @xmath36 .",
    "to compute @xmath38 in liquid @xmath2he at several densities , we have carried out different simulations with a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions containing @xmath39 atoms interacting through the aziz pair potential.@xcite at first we study the system at the equilibrium density @xmath40 @xmath41 : our result for @xmath0 is shown in fig .
