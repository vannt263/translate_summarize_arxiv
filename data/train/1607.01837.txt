    "one of the most inescapable facts in recent cosmology is that the universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "the effect of this acceleration was observed through measurements of supernovae @xcite , confirming previous indications from large - scale structure and galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the source of this late - time acceleration has been named ` dark energy ' which exerts a negative pressure to combat the attractive force of gravity .",
    "currently the simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "however theoretical calculations yield a value of @xmath1 at least 120 orders of magnitude larger than observations @xcite . as a result ,",
    "cosmological models that do not include an explicit cosmological constant form an appealing alternative .",
    "these alternatives are usually categorized depending upon which side of the einstein equations they alter .",
    "the first category adds to or alters the energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 to yield a negative pressure ( dark fluid models ) , while the second category alters the einstein tensor @xmath10 to generate the acceleration ( modified gravity models ) . throughout this paper",
    "we focus on a specific modified theory , @xmath11 gravity .",
    "@xmath11 gravity changes the gravitational theory by modifying the action , from the standard einstein - hilbert action , to be some new function of the ricci scalar @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "given the freedom to choose the function @xmath11 , the expansion histories of both @xmath1cdm and @xmath11 models can be very similar , or even identical @xcite .",
    "therefore we must consider alternate methods to observationally differentiate between the models .",
    "one such approach is to study the peculiar velocity of galaxies which result from the gravitational interaction between a galaxy and the surrounding matter , causing the galaxy redshift to deviate from hubble s law .",
    "in essence , the peculiar velocity of a galaxy is an integrated history of its gravitational interactions , and thus provides a tool to differentiate between @xmath1cdm and @xmath11 models .",
    "measuring peculiar velocities offers an observational difficulty as such measurements must be performed using redshift independent distance indicators such as type ia supernovae @xcite , the tully - fisher relation @xcite and the fundamental plane relation @xcite .",
    "a common parameter that many peculiar velocity surveys quote is the net dipole , or the ` bulk flow ' , of the peculiar velocity field .",
    "there has been much debate over whether the measured bulk flows are consistent with the @xmath1cdm model . @xcite",
    "analyzed 2,018 galaxies from the 2mass tully - fisher survey ( 2mtf ) utilizing both @xmath13 and minimum variance methods , finding a bulk flow that is consistent with the @xmath1cdm model to a @xmath5 level .",
    "conversely , @xcite utilized a catalogue of 4,481 peculiar velocity measurements with a characteristic depth of @xmath14mpc and claim that the resulting bulk flow is inconsistent with the @xmath1cdm model at a @xmath1598% confidence level .",
    "a possible solution to these anomolaous bulk flow measurements is to adopt a modified theory of gravity . to this end",
    ", n - body simulations can be employed to evolve particles under both @xmath1cdm and modified gravity models .",
    "the results of these simulations can then be compared to surveys such as 2mtf .",
    "an added benefit of utilizing n - body simulations to measure bulk flow is the lack of underlying systematic biases that most surveys are subject to .",
    "this is especially important as @xcite has shown that unaccounted systematic uncertainty could explain the discrepancies between surveys agreeing / disagreeing with the @xmath1cdm model . in this paper",
    "we utilize n - body simulations to measure bulk flow in both @xmath1cdm and @xmath11 regimes . in section 2",
    "we outline @xmath11 gravity and show how we quantify the deviation from the @xmath1cdm model . in section 3 we give an overview of the simulations we use , how the output is utilized to calculate bulk flow and a brief outline of the 2mtf survey . in section 4",
    "we present the results of the simulations and compare them to the 2mtf survey .",
    "we conclude in section 5 . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a standard cosmology of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 km s@xmath19mpc@xmath19 .",
    "whilst our results are @xmath20 independent , we use a value of @xmath21 in our simulations .",
    "dynamics in a general relativistic regime are governed by the einstein - hilbert action given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath24 is the determinant of the metric @xmath25 , @xmath0 is some general function of the ricci scalar r , @xmath26 is the action of some matter fields @xmath27 and we have used units where @xmath28 .    by varying the action with respect to the metric",
    "we obtain @xmath29 where the field @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the dalembert operator and @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if we select @xmath0 according to @xmath1cdm , @xmath32 , we see that the derivatives in equation [ eq : varying ] vanish recovering the einstein field equation . in the @xmath11 regime , the n - body code that we use ( see",
    "section 3 ) employs the expression @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are model parameters and @xmath37 is the characteristic length scale , with @xmath38 being the present fractional matter density @xcite .    by definition of this modified theory of gravity , there is no true cosmological constant .",
    "however , at curvatures larger than @xmath39 , @xmath11 may be expanded as @xmath40 the limiting case of @xmath41 , at fixed @xmath42 , is a cosmological constant hence our model requires that as @xmath41 , we approach @xmath1cdm gravity . furthermore , by taking the trace of equation [ eq : varying ] , one obtains a field equation for @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the density of the universe . as a result , the impact of @xmath11 gravity can be viewed in terms of the field @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "utilizing these two facts , we characterize the deviation from the @xmath1cdm model by the value of @xmath43 at the present epoch given by @xmath46 where larger @xmath47 mimics @xmath1cdm until later times . throughout our work",
    "we exclusively use @xmath48 .",
    "for all our simulations we use @xmath49 dark matter particles placed inside a box with side length @xmath50mpc .",
    "the initial conditions were generated using 2lptic which uses second order lagrangian perturbation theory thereby offering increased accuracy compared to the zeldovich approach @xcite .",
    "to specify how the 2lptic grid is distributed , we use the transfer function and power spectrum at @xmath51 generated by camb @xcite to calculate the power spectrum at the starting redshift @xmath52 . the @xmath53 value used is @xmath54 assuming a @xmath55 baryon fraction .    in this work we use the n - body simulator ecosmog which is specifically designed to simulate the universe under @xmath11 gravity @xcite .",
    "ecosmog is based upon the ramses code , and uses an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , which allows direct control of the trade off between accuracy and speed @xcite .",
    "we have a minimum force resolution of @xmath56mpc ( for the course grid ) , increasing to a maximum of @xmath57kpc ( with six levels of refinement ) , which is sufficient for our work where our minimum sphere radius is @xmath2mpc .",
    "the code works by locally solving the perturbation equations for the gravitational potential @xmath58 and @xmath43 field @xmath59 , \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the overbars denote the background values @xcite . in underdense regions , the @xmath63 in equation [ eq:1 ]",
    "vanishes causing the two equations to decouple and resulting in gravity simply being enhanced by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "however in overdense regions , @xmath65 becomes negligible recovering the poisson equation for general relativity , @xmath66 .",
    "the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) tully - fisher survey ( 2mtf ; @xcite ) utilizes photometry data from 2mass in conjunction with rotation and hi widths to calculate the tully - fisher ( tf ) distance from the redshifts in the 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ; @xcite ) .",
    "in essence , 2mtf worked to calculate a universal calibration for the tf relation when utilizing the 2mass photometry data in the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 bands .",
    "the difficulty in deriving a global tf calibration is that thought must be given to survey specific biases as explained in depth by @xcite .",
    "@xcite then calculate peculiar velocities of @xmath70 galaxies by comparing the magnitude predicted by the observed redshift of the galaxy and the tf predicted redshift .    with the peculiar velocities calculated , 2mtf determines the bulk flow at various depths by applying a @xmath13 minimization using weights that account for the measurement error in distance ratio and the redshift and number density distributions of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite also calculates the bulk flow via other methods which we do not use for comparison in this paper for simplicity s sake .",
    "we use the 2mtf survey as a comparison as it covers both small and large scales allowing us to probe how @xmath11 bulk flows compare at a variety of depths .",
    "it is possible to extend our work to even larger scales utilizing other work such as @xcite who use data from the 6df galaxy survey to calculate bulk flows of depths from @xmath71 to @xmath72 @xmath73mpc .",
    "this further comparison was not performed in this work as the data was not available at the time this research was undertaken .",
    "we run the simulation until @xmath51 ( in a co - moving frame ) at which point the simulator outputs the position and velocity of each dark matter particle . as the equations of motion",
    "are solved in a co - moving frame , the output include only the peculiar velocity of the particle .    the bulk flow in a spherical region of radius @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the peculiar velocity field . due to the nature of this equation",
    ", the peculiar velocity must be sampled uniformly over the volume .",
    "however as we wish to compare our results to 2mtf in which the uniformity requirement is not met , we calculate the bulk flow via the following process :    1 .",
    "select a random point inside the simulation box to be the center of the mock .",
    "this point is chosen such that any particle in the mock survey lies within the box . for our work ,",
    "we use the 2mtf distance bound of @xmath77mpc .",
    "we further select the random point such that spheres of radius @xmath3mpc will not overlap each other ensuring that each mock survey is independent .",
    "2 .   for each particle , if it is within the distance and latitude bounds , bin the particle into the corresponding redshift bin .",
    "this redshift is the observed redshift and is calculated using equation [ eq : redshift ] , where @xmath78 is the peculiar redshift determined by projecting the peculiar velocity along the line of sight and @xmath79 is the recession redshift dictated by the co - moving distance between the particle and center of the mock .",
    "once again we follow 2mtf which only surveyed galaxies with latitude @xmath80 ( figure [ fig : angles ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 3 .",
    "normalize the redshift histogram and create an array of accepted particles such that the resulting distribution will follow that of 2mtf ( figure [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "the accepted particles are chosen randomly from each redshift bin .",
    "note that the similarity between the redshift distribution of the mocks and 2mtf is not overly important and will not affect the results in a significant manner ; as such , we only roughly follow the 2mtf distribution .",
    "4 .   for each sphere radius ,",
    "if an accepted particle lies within the radius , add its peculiar velocity component to the total .",
    "once all accepted particles have been checked , the bulk flow is given by equation [ eq : bulk ] where @xmath82 is the net peculiar velocity in each direction and @xmath83 is the number of particles inside the sphere of radius @xmath74 . @xmath84",
    "figure [ fig : results ] and table [ tab : results ] shows the mean bulk flow amplitude over @xmath71 mock surveys in both @xmath1cdm and @xmath11 regimes at depths ranging from @xmath2mpc to @xmath3mpc . as a point of reference",
    ", we also show the 2mtf results for their 3 band , @xmath13 minimization , at depths of @xmath2mpc , @xmath85mpc and @xmath86mpc @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 mocks provides adequate convergence for the covariance matrix for the uncertainty in the bulk flow amplitude ( appendix [ sec : error ] )    following the procedure outlined in @xcite , the @xmath1cdm bulk flow variance is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the hubble constant , @xmath89 is the linear growth rate , @xmath90 is the gaussian window function , @xmath91 is the wavenumber and @xmath92 is the matter power spectrum .",
    "the probability density function for a bulk flow amplitude b is given by @xmath93 where the distribution has been normalized by setting @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "due to the nature of bulk flow , this distribution is maxwellian hence the peak will occur at @xmath95 .",
    "we adopt this peak as the theoretical bulk flow measurement in the @xmath1cdm regime with @xmath5 error bars given by integrating equation [ eq : distribution ] around the peak .    from table [ tab :",
    "results ] we observe that there is little difference between @xmath1cdm and @xmath4 bulk flow amplitudes .",
    "this is not too surprising as the @xmath11 modification is negligible recovering standard @xmath1cdm .",
    "there is a noticeable increase in the bulk flow amplitude when the @xmath11 strength is increased to @xmath6 or @xmath8 .",
    "this is the result of the poisson equation being enhanced by the presence of a non - negligible @xmath43 .",
    "we find that our @xmath4 and @xmath1cdm results agree comfortably with the 2mtf survey at all scales .",
    "whilst the 2mtf result at @xmath86mpc agrees with all of our mocks , it disagrees with the expected trend of decreasing amplitude as sphere radius increases suggesting that we should be hesitant to take it to be as an accurate data point in comparison to our mocks .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath1cdm mocks are in agreement with the theoretical predictions for all scales with the @xmath96 results agreeing only at smaller scales .",
    "in essence , we are constraining @xmath7 to be below @xmath97 and between @xmath8 and @xmath98 at a one sigma level .",
    "such a constraint matches previous work where @xmath7 was constrained to @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 levels @xcite .",
    "furthermore if we wished to explain the anomolaous result of @xcite who found a bulk flow amplitude of @xmath103 km s@xmath19 ( error to @xmath104 ) on a scale of @xmath3mpc , we would need to adopt @xmath105 which disagrees with both 2mtf and the previously cited work .    [",

    "modified gravity theories provide an appealing alternative to the @xmath1cdm model by providing a model that does not include an explicit cosmological constant .",
    "one such theory , @xmath11 gravity , involves changing the einstein - hilbert action by altering the functional dependence upon the ricci scalar .",
    "we consider one particular @xmath0 model , the hu & sawicki model @xcite , and parameterise the degree of deviation from the predictions of standard @xmath1cdm through the gradient of the function today @xmath106 .",
    "the bulk flow is the net dipole moment of the cosmological peculiar velocity field , which is the result of gravitational influence on the motions of particles on large scales . as the bulk flow is sensitive to the gravitational theory considered , this results in a measurable difference in the predicted value of the bulk flow between @xmath1cdm and @xmath11 gravity .",
    "we utilized n - body simulations to create a set of mock surveys under both @xmath1cdm and @xmath11 gravity .",
    "these mocks were analyzed assuming the redshift and sky distribution of 2mtf , a previous survey that studied the bulk flow in the local universe @xcite .",
    "we found that the simulations under @xmath1cdm and @xmath4 gravity produced bulk flows that were consistent with both 2mtf and @xmath1cdm predictions . choosing @xmath96 gave bulk flows that agreed with the @xmath1cdm predictions on small scales with weak agreement on large scales .",
    "finally , setting @xmath6 resulted in bulk flows that did not agree with @xmath1cdm predictions to a @xmath5 level at all scales considered . from these results",
    "we conclude that in order to obtain bulk flow measurements that match previous work @xcite in addition to theoretical predictions , the upper limit on @xmath7 lies somewhere in the range @xmath8 and @xmath98 .",
    "we finally note that , given the agreement between the @xmath1cdm and @xmath4 predictions , it seems unlikely that bulk flow measurements can be of any further use in constraining the parameters in an @xmath0 theory .",
    "we have already reached the theoretical limit in which the bulk flow amplitude will provide useful information . instead to make further progress in this area ,",
