    "a system of two planets on low - inclination and eccentricity orbits will never experience mutual close encounters if the initial semi - major axis difference , @xmath5 , measured in mutual hill radii , exceeds @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for multi - planet systems , @xcite numerically investigated the dependence of the timescale of the first planetary encounter , @xmath7 , on the planet mass , @xmath8 , number of planets , @xmath9 , and the spacing between them , @xmath5 .",
    "when all planets have the same mass , they found that @xmath10 of the timescale is proportional to the planet spacing in hill radii . when the number of planets @xmath11 , the timescale is not strongly dependent on the number of planets . here",
    "@xmath12 is the planet mass in units of the stellar mass .",
    "the total mass in planets in a system would be @xmath13 .    for the number of planets @xmath14 , the time to first encounter , @xmath7 , varies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 years for planet masses @xmath17 ranging from @xmath18 where a year represents the orbital period of the innermost planet .",
    "large variations in planet mass are required to significantly change the timescale required for instability to develop ( e.g. , see figure 4 by @xcite ) .",
    "the time to first planet / planet encounter is much more sensitive to planetary spacing than it is to planet mass since the hill radius is only dependent on mass ratio to the one third .",
    "this implies that a higher total mass in planets can be resident in a stable system when the mean planet mass is higher even though the planets must be somewhat further apart .",
    "a nearly unstable system with a larger number of earth mass planets must have spacings such that the system has lower total mass in planets than a nearly unstable system containing small number of somewhat more widely spaced jupiter mass planets .",
    "for example , a planetary system that has not suffered a near encounter in @xmath16 years has spacing greater than distance in mutual hill radii , @xmath19 for planet mass ratio @xmath20 but only @xmath21 for @xmath22 and .    for a system observed with a dusty disk containing an interior clearing , we assume that bodies residing between the planets must have been removed via dynamical processes on a timescale shorter than the age of the system . if numerous planetesimals lie interior to the clearing they could efficiently produce dust in the clearing .",
    "dust produced in the outer disk can scatter into the clearing because the collision timescales estimated from the dust opacity is significantly shorter than the ages of the systems .",
    "dust can also drift into the clearing because of radiative forces .",
    "studies of dust particle integrations suggest that massive planets , at least neptune in size , are required to account for a clearing in the dust distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sharp eccentric edges such as that in the fomalhaut system @xcite imply that clearing by planets is required in some systems @xcite .",
    "our assumption is consistent with scenarios for the evolution of our solar system .",
    "most orbits in between jupiter and neptune become planet orbit crossing within the age of the solar system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless cratering history suggests that there was an epoch of early bombardment possibly associated with the clearing of interplanetary debris ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that some systems with detected ir excesses may contain evidence for inner exo - zodiacal belts ( e.g. , hd12039 ; @xcite ) in their spectral energy distribution or they may be present but below the detection limit .",
    "nevertheless if planetesimals are originally widely distributed and contain enough mass to form planets ( as suggested by the cratering record in our solar system ) , then the lack of bright or detected exo - zodiacal belts implies that most planetesimals have been ejected , accreted onto planetary bodies or have fallen into the central star .",
    "in this paper we combine the assumptions that planetesimals within a dust disk edge must be removed within the age of the system with estimates of the timescale @xmath7 for the first planet / planet encounter in a multiple planet system . while other explanations for clearing exist , such as a single planet migrating outward constantly eroding away the inner edge of the disk @xcite , we only consider clearing via multiple planet induced instability .",
    "we estimate a minimum spacing between planets such that objects placed between them are likely to be removed on a timescale shorter than the age of the system while the planets themselves remain stable . for simulations with planets ,",
    "only the timescale until first planet / planet encounter depends on the planetary spacing and planet mass .",
    "here we estimate the planet spacing for the instability of inter planetary objects by requiring the planets to be twice as far away as required for a first planet / planet encounter to occur during the age of the system .",
    "such a system will have planets which will be stable on a timescale much longer than the age of that system .",
    "however , particles between the planets will have timescales shorter than the age of the system ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that interplanetary particles residing in the system should have instability timescales similar to those estimated from n - body simulations of planets spaced at half the spacing . by doubling the spacing ,",
    "we ensure that under these timescales , the planets will be stable while the planetesimals will be cleared .",
    "the age of the system is a timescale for planetesimal clearing , not planetary instability .",
    "as all massive bodies influence each other and low mass bodies do not influence massive ones , we expect that our estimate for the required planetary spacing is conservative .",
    "our spacing estimate will be larger than the actual one required for efficient clearing of interplanetary bodies and so will lead to a lower limit on the number of , and total mass , in planets required to clear particles from clearings .",

    "that is , a system of five planets has similar close encounter timescale dependence on separation as a system of ten or twenty planets . as we desire an estimate for the number of planets , we compute the stability timescale for a larger number of bodies in such a way as to be insensitive to actual number of planets .",

    "faults in this equation are discussed in the final section of this paper .",
    "we use the relationship measured from the integrations ( equation [ key ] ) to estimate the minimum spacing between planets required for bodies to be removed within a clearing .",
    "we set @xmath7 in the above equation to the age of the system , requiring particle removal in the clearing within the lifetime of the star .",

    "the factor of two is used to ensure that over this timescale , the planetesimals are cleared while the planets themselves remain stable .",

    "the outermost planet must reside within the dust disk clearing so we can set @xmath43 to the radius corresponding to the dust temperature estimated from infrared spectra .",

    "the iceline represents a convenient limit for the inner radius .",
    "while massive planet formation models favor formation outside the iceline , planets could migrate closer to the star .",
    "massive planets could reside within the iceline so our estimate for the total number of planets is a lower limit .    the number of planets in a system is then given by : @xmath50 the factor of 2 for @xmath27 on the right hand side follows because we have set the planets to be twice as far away as that required for instability in the pure 10-body system ( see discussion in section 1 ) .",
    "the remaining quantity that we must choose to estimate the number of planets is the planet mass ratio , @xmath17 .",
    "recent studies suggest that maintenance of a clearing in the dust distribution requires at least a neptune mass planet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt this mass ratio , @xmath51 as a starting point and then will consider the effect of varying this ratio .",
    "once we estimate the number of planets present , the total mass in planets @xmath52 the actual mass in planets is likely to be higher than the above estimate for a number of reasons : there may be massive planets within the iceline .",
    "we have assumed that all planets have the same mass .",
    "if more massive planets are present then a larger total planet mass could be present .",
    "this follows because @xmath27 is not strongly dependent on planet mass .",
    "our integrations were run with ten planets but we may estimate that the number of required planets is fewer and systems with fewer planets are likely to be more stable .",

    "we find that the total number of planets is insensitive to the assumed mass ratio for @xmath56 .",
    "planets with ratios lower than this are unlikely to be able to effectively eject material from central clearings within the lifetime of the system .",
    "while the total number of estimated planets is likely to be low , the total mass in planets could be an order of magnitude higher than given in table 1 .",
    "jupiter mass planets with similar number and only slightly larger spacings would be capable ejecting material from the clearings during the lifetime of these systems .",
    "it is interesting to compute the total number of planets for our solar system assuming a dust belt in the kuiper belt were detected ( as predicted by @xcite ) . using @xmath57 au and and an iceline at 1.0 au for @xmath44 we would predict @xmath58 neptune mass planets , giving a total planetary mass of 0.36 @xmath55 .",
    "much lower than the actual planetary mass in our solar system in this semi - major axis range ( 1.4 @xmath55 ) , we reiterate that our caclulations represent an absolute lower limit on the total planetary mass of a system .",
    "our solar system easily increases its planetary mass since the planets closer than neptune have varying mass ratios larger than that of neptune .",
    "since stabilty is less dependent on mass ratio than spacing , fewer more massive planets exist , thus increasing total planetary mass in the solar system .",
