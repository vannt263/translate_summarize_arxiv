    "the hubbard model is a paradigm for one of the most difficult quantum manybody systems ; strong interactions competing with the kinetic energy in a dense electron gas .",
    "these problems must be explored either analytically by relatively poorly controlled approximate methods or by methods such as monte - carlo , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) or finite size calculations .",
    "a major difficulty is the absence of a framework for such systems that competes in simplicity and rigor with conventional landau fermi - liquid theory .",
    "a particularly intriguing scenario for non - fermi liquid behavior is `` spin - charge separation '' with a low - energy effective theory where spin and charge excitations are decoupled .",
    "this idea has attracted widespread attention because it migh provide a route to high - temperature superconductivity in a system with strong local repulsion . in 1-d",
    "it is known through the use of `` bosonization '' that spin - charge separatation does occur at low energy.@xcite in higher dimensions , much less is known .",
    "the usual approach to spin charge separation is to construct electron operators as composite objects consisting of a charge part , the `` holon '' , and a spin part , the `` spinon '' . to avoid unphysical states contraints have to be included",
    "which are then treated by approximate methods.@xcite    here we shall construct electron operators as composites of charge - like and spin - like operators that do not give rise to any unphysical states and thus avoids introducing any constraints .",
    "an exact local mapping which is valid in all dimensions will be shown to exist from a purely fermionic manybody system to an equivalent system of fermions and spin - like operators obeying bosonic commutation relations between different lattice sites .",
    "we shall explore this with the 2-d hubbard model , for which the resulting mapping bears a resemblance to the mappings of the local hilbert space achieved by introducing spinons and holons .",
    "let @xmath1 be the particle number at site @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 be respectively the number of up and down electrons : @xmath5 .",
    "since the hubbard interaction obeys @xmath6 , by choosing the chemical potential appropriately we can replace the usual hubbard interaction with the particle - hole symmetric interaction @xmath7 .",
    "we thus write the hubbard model in the particle - hole symmetric form @xmath8 where the sum is over all sites and nearest neighbor bonds counted once .",
    "we now demonstrate an exact transformation of the local operator algebra of the hubbard model to new fermionic @xmath9 `` quasicharge '' @xmath10 and @xmath11 `` quasispin '' operators @xmath12 that obey , respectively , fermi and bose statistics .",
    "the operators are given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is @xmath15 depending on which sublattice site @xmath2 is on .",
    "we define the @xmath16 and @xmath17 component of quasispin by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the factor appearing as @xmath20 can in fact be chosen as an arbitrary phase , but is fixed here to preserve symmetries specific to the hubbard model .",
    "this  nonlinear ",
    "transformation generalizes earlier work on transformations that were strictly canonical , and hence did not alter commutation relations of the fermi operators.@xcite    the new operators obey the following algebra , which can be verified by straightforward manipulations : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 = 0 $ ] , @xmath24 = i \\delta_{r{{r ' } } }   \\sum_{k } \\epsilon_{ijk } { q^{k}_{r } } $ ]      we define the quasicharge operator as @xmath29 .",
    "we find the following relations with the usual operators expressed in terms of ordinary fermions : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the pauli matrices .",
    "we also define the local  pseudospin",
    " operators @xmath35 which are the generators of the su(2 ) algebra which correponds to  rotations  between the empty and doubly occupied states.@xcite the formal resemblance to spin symmetry has led to the name pseudospin",
    ". the total z - component of pseudospin can therefore be seen to be half the number of doubly occupied sites minus the number of empty sites , which is precisely the charge relative to half filling .",
    "pseudospin is a symmetry of the particle - hole symmetric hubbard model but is broken by a chemical potential .",
    "we note that , aside from phase factors , the quasicharge operators always create even charged states from odd and vice versa , as they must since they are fermionic .",
    "however , there is a precise phase relationship which is not so easily interpreted that is enforced by the commutation relations and symmetries .",
    "our hubbard model can now be rewritten _",
    "exactly _ in terms of the quasiparticle operators as @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this representation ,",
    "the symmetry under the entire @xmath11 quasispin rotation is manifest and we note that the hubbard interaction becomes simply the quasicharge number operator .",
    "we define total quasispin @xmath40 , spin @xmath41 and pseudospin @xmath42 respectively by @xmath43 etc .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 all obey the su(2 ) algebra @xmath46 = i \\sum_{k } \\epsilon_{ijk } p_k \\ ; $ ] etc .",
    "we see from the definitions above eq .",
    "[ eq : newhub ] the relationship , @xmath47 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath48 , i.e. quasispin can be exactly split into pseudospin and spin , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 providing the projection operator of @xmath51 into either spin or pseudospin . since @xmath51 commutes with @xmath26 and the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath52 depends on @xmath53 only through rotationally invariant terms , we conclude that @xmath54 = 0 $ ] .",

    "the operators @xmath57 are identical to the operators defined in ref .",

    "it can be inferred that @xmath63 = 0 $ ] since @xmath64 is known to commute with ordinary spin .",
    "we now define the usual canonical transformation @xmath65 which splits the hamiltonian into pieces that preserve total quasicharge .",
    "we define @xmath66 $ ] and it straightforward to show that @xmath67 = ( { { t_{-1}}}+ { { t_1 } } )   $ ] , whereby it follows that @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 / u     -   $ ] @xmath71 / ( 2 u^2 ) + ...    $ ] @xmath72 splits into two terms . the first term @xmath73 is the ordinary spin interaction in the `` spin - only '' sector @xmath74    where @xmath75 and the second term @xmath76 couples quasispin and quasicharge @xmath77 the last summation runs over all three - site neighbors connected by links . terms of order @xmath78 which are already present to order @xmath79 or @xmath0 are ignored .",
    "according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , to all orders in @xmath80 the operator @xmath65 which diagonalizes total quasicharge is a polynomial of @xmath81 , and hence to all orders in perturbation theory , the transformation by @xmath82 will preserve all the symmetries @xmath83 and @xmath84 in this formulation .",
    "under this canonical transformation the eigenstates of @xmath85 will map to the eigenstates of the hubbard model represented by the bare quasiparticle operators through the transformation @xmath86 .",
    "we let @xmath87 be eigenstates of @xmath85 and @xmath88 .",
    "adapting ref .",
    "@xcite to our problem , there will be a `` zeroth hubbard band '' or `` spin - only sector '' of solutions corresponding to @xmath89 being identically zero so that @xmath85 reduces exactly to @xmath90 .",
    "we conclude @xmath91 is identically zero and the effective hamiltonian of the zeroth subband to order @xmath92 is exactly the heisenberg model .",
    "what can we conclude from symmetries about the properties of the zeroth hubbard band ?",
    "it must be remembered that @xmath93 is not a `` good quantum number '' i.e. is neither invariant under the symmetries nor under @xmath94 .",
    "we have therefore no information about @xmath95 from symmetry arguments alone .",
    "we see that @xmath96 throughout the entire lattice in the entire zeroth hubbard subband",
    ". we can therefore conclude that @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 commutes with @xmath65 , this assertion survives to all orders in perturbation theory and we can conclude that @xmath99 in fact quasispin and ordinary spin coincide . since @xmath100 is equal to physical charge , we see that the spin - only sector has indeed charge density corresponding to half filling .    the pseudospin is given by @xmath101 if there is exactly one quasicharge , we conclude from the fact that @xmath102 that @xmath103 . we have thus identified the lowest nonzero quasicharge sector with the spin half representation of pseudospin , exactly what we need to associate it with one added positive or negative physical charge .",
    "we can derive a set of extended charge states in the dilute limit by a mean field treatment of eq .",
    "[ eq : pert ] , replacing @xmath104 . in two dimensions ,",
    "these have the spectrum @xmath105 where @xmath106 and where @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 denote nearest neighbor and longer range heisenberg correlations . using the numerical value @xmath110 @xcite",
    "we find @xmath111 .",
    "we find a quasicharge spectrum bounded by @xmath112 and shown in the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the present calculation makes the `` nagaoka theorem '' natural.@xcite consider eq .",
    "[ eq : newhub ] in the case where the quasispins are perfectly aligned along the quasispin z axis . in this case",
    "@xmath113 , the operator @xmath114 will be identically zero and the kinetic energy @xmath115 becomes precisely @xmath116 .",
    "these are quasicharges moving independently of the ferromagnetic quasispins and are ordinary holes in a perfect 2-d ferromagnet which the kinetic energy @xmath117 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the nagaoka theorem states that as @xmath118 a single charge causes the ground state of @xmath52 to become ferromagnetic . this nagaoka ferromagnet with charge one has hubbard energy @xmath119 , whereas the antiferromagnetic solution with a single quasicharge has energy @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the number of lattice sites in the system .",
    "we therefore find that @xmath122 when the inequality @xmath123 holds .",
    "we see that whether or not there is nagaoka ferromagnetism depends on which order we take @xmath0 and @xmath121 to infinity .    the argument can be used to estimate when the antiferromagnet becomes unstable to ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . let us consider a quasicharge density of @xmath124 .",
    "we see that if @xmath125 obeys @xmath126 the dilute ferromagnet will be energetically favored over a collection of extended quasicharge states , essentially reproducing the argument by ioffe and larkin.@xcite    using the previous ideas , we shall study localized states in a 2-d antiferromagnet .",
    "as we have seen , a quasicharge hops freely on a ferromagnetic bond where @xmath113 . in a mean field treatment of the quasispins , to linear order in @xmath127 a quasicharge can not hop an a bond with antialigned quasispins since @xmath128 .",
    "starting with a patch of locally neel ordered quasispins oriented along @xmath129 we consider a quasispin state with nearby spins flipped relative to the neel state on diagonally adjacent sites of the spin - down sublattice .",
    "we note that in the presence of a quasispin ferromagnet oriented along @xmath130 , quasicharge corresponds to physical charge measured from half filling",
    ".    the core of the region will thus be a ferromagnet surrounded by a closed boundary of antialigned spins . outside this patch , quasispins are allowed to relax , so that far away the system will be a heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the two smallest such configurations are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we identify the quasispin of the state by constructing the neel state with the same rotational symmetry around the cluster . the smallest cluster ( fig.[fig : fig1],a )",
    "has one flipped spin thus has @xmath131 whereas the cluster with two flipped spins ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1],b ) has @xmath132 .",
    "we now add @xmath133 quasicharges to the cluster . according to the definition of pseudospin , in the case",
    "where quasicharge is confined to a quasiferromagnetic region with @xmath134 , it can be shown that @xmath135 .",
    "a cluster with @xmath133 units of quasicharge will thus have pseudospin @xmath136 and , from the identity @xmath137 , physical spin @xmath138 .",
    "the clusters with no quasicharge have pseudospin zero and physical spin equal to quasispin , whereas the charge one cluster will have pseudospin @xmath139 and spin @xmath140 .",
    "the energies of these states are approximate but the spin and pseudospin quantum numbers are exact . as quasicharge is added in the cluster , quasispin , spin and pseudospin continue to be good quantum numbers . since quasispin is conserved upon adding quasicharge each such configuration has a well defined value of quasispin independent of physical spin or charge and can be calculated in the effective theory .",
    "quasicharge , however , is not a good quantum number , and will change upon transforming back the the physical state with @xmath141 .",
    "we estimate the energy by keeping only the part of the kinetic energy linear in @xmath79 and ignore the spin exchange energy beyond the antiferromagnetic boundary of the cluster . for the smallest @xmath131 cluster",
    "we see sixteen bonds that are strongly affected by the localized charge .",
    "four bonds are ferromagnetic with zero energy and twelve bonds are antiferromagnetic with energy @xmath142 , i.e. they retain about 85% of the energy of the unaffected neel state @xmath143 .",
    "the energy of these states is compactly written with the spectroscopic - like notation @xmath144 where @xmath83 is the quasispin , @xmath145 is the charge relative to half filling and @xmath146 is the spin .",
    "thus @xmath147 is the energy of the the smallest uncharged cluster measured with respect to the heisenberg ground state .",
    "we find @xmath148 .",
    "the five kinetic energy eigenvalues of this cluster are @xmath149 .",
    "we thus find @xmath150 .",
    "for the @xmath132 cluster we find a kinetic energy for a single charge @xmath151 ; there are 16 antiferromagnetic bonds and 8 ferromagnetic bonds giving @xmath152 .",
    "the energy of these states are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and compared to the energy of the band of extended states from eq .",
    "[ extended ] .",
    "we find that for large @xmath153 the clusters with localized charge are energetically favored over the extended states . as @xmath0 becomes larger , larger clusters lower the energy in accordance with the nagaoka theorem .",
    "we have demonstrated an exact local mapping from a fermionic many - body system to system of interacting bosons and fermions that does not introduce constraints .",
    "the mapping provides a paradigm for a non - fermi liquid behavior for correlated fermions valid in any dimension .",
    "applied to the 2-d hubbard model the transformation makes precise earlier attempts that relied on approximations and constraints to discuss spin and charge as composite operators .",
    "our calculations supports the idea of low energy localized states where spin is bound to charge in the limit of large @xmath153",
