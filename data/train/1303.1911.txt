    "energy harvesting from the environment is a promising solution to provide perpetual power supplies for energy demanding or energy constrained wireless networks such as . besides other",
    "well known environmental sources such as wind and solar , ambient radio signals can be a viable new source for energy harvesting .",
    "on the other hand , radio signals have been widely used for wireless information transmission . as a result , a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) has recently drawn significant attention , which is not only theoretically intricate but also practically valuable for enabling both the wireless data and wireless energy access to mobile terminals at the same time .",
    "there have been a handful of prior studies on swipt in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "swipt in a point - to - point single - antenna additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel was first studied from an information - theoretic standpoint .",
    "this work was then extended to frequency - selective awgn channels in @xcite , where a non - trivial tradeoff between information rate and harvested energy was shown by varying power allocation over frequency .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied swipt for fading awgn channels subject to time - varying co - channel interference , and proposed a new principle termed `` opportunistic energy harvesting '' where the receiver switches between harvesting energy and decoding information based on the wireless link quality and interference condition . in @xcite ,",
    "various practical receiver architectures for swipt were investigated , where a new integrated information and energy receiver design was proposed . moreover , motivated by the great success of multi - antenna techniques in wireless communication , swipt for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels has been investigated in @xcite . in @xcite , zhang and",
    "ho first investigated swipt for the mimo broadcast channel ( bc ) with a multi - antenna transmitter sending information and energy simultaneously to one pair of energy receiver and information receiver , each with single or multiple antennas .",
    "under two practical setups where information and energy receivers are either separated or co - located , the optimal precoder designs were developed to achieve various information and energy transmission tradeoffs .",
    "the study in @xcite was also extended to the cases with imperfect channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter in @xcite and mimo relay broadcast channels in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a transmitter design based on random beamforming was proposed for a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) swipt system with artificial channel fading generated for improving the performance of opportunistic information decoding ( i d ) versus energy harvesting ( eh ) over quasi - static channels , when the csi was not available at the transmitter .",
    "= 1     despite of the above theoretical advance , in order to implement swipt systems in practice , many challenging issues still remain to be addressed .",
    "for example , conventional wireless information and energy receivers were separately designed to operate with very different power sensitivities ( e.g. , @xmath0 dbm for eh receivers versus @xmath1 dbm for i d receivers ) . as a result ,",
    "existing eh circuits for radio signals are not yet able to be used for i d directly and vice versa .",
    "this thus motivates our work in this paper to investigate a practical design of the miso broadcast system for swipt as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , where a multi - antenna access point ( ap ) transmits simultaneously to multiple single - antenna receivers each of which implements eh or i d , but _ not both _ at the same time . to exploit the `` near - far '' channel conditions in this multiuser swipt system , we propose a receiver location based transmission scheduling , where receivers that are close to the ap are scheduled for eh while those more far apart from the ap are scheduled for i d .",
    "notice that the proposed user scheduling rule resolves the mismatched power sensitivity problem for eh and i d receivers as mentioned above , and thus makes the swipt system realizable with existing eh and i d receivers . under this setup",
    ", we aim to jointly design the beamforming weights and power allocation at the transmitter to optimally balance the performance tradeoffs among different information / energy receivers . specifically , we study the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design to maximize the weighted sum - power transferred to all eh receivers subject to a given set of minimum signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraints at different i d receivers .",
    "in particular , we consider two types of i d receivers , namely _ type i _ and _ type ii _ receivers , which _ do not possess _ and _ possess _ the capability of cancelling the interference from simultaneously transmitted energy signals ( whose waveforms are assumed to be _ a priori _ known at the transmitter and all type ii i d receivers ) , respectively . for each type of i",
    "d receivers , the design problem is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program ( qcqp ) , which is non - convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally by standard convex optimization techniques @xcite .",
    "first , we obtain the optimal solutions to the formulated non - convex qcqps for two types of i d receivers by applying an optimization technique so - called semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) , it is revealed that for type i i d receivers , no dedicated energy beam is needed to achieve the optimal solution , while for type ii i d receivers , employing no more than one energy beam is optimal .",
    "it is worth noting that sdr has been widely applied in the miso broadcast channel ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) to obtain efficient ( and even optimal under certain cases ) beamforming solutions for various information transmission problems ; however , the existing results are not directly applicable to our newly formulated problems with the joint energy and information beamforming optimization .",
    "next , in order to gain further insight to the optimal energy and information beamforming design , we reformulate the qcqp problem for each i d receiver type to an equivalent transmit power minimization problem for the miso - bc with information transmission only . by applying this new duality result , we develop alternative algorithms based on iterative uplink and downlink transmit optimization to obtain the same optimal downlink beamforming solutions as by sdr .",
    "it is worth noting that the uplink - downlink duality has been extensively investigated in the literature to solve non - convex transmit beamforming optimization problems in miso / mimo bcs for e.g. , sinr balancing in @xcite , transmit power minimization in @xcite , and capacity region computation in @xcite .",
    "especially , for transmit power minimization in miso - bc with given sinr constraints for information transfer only , it was shown in @xcite that the downlink beamforming problem can be transformed into its dual multiple - access - channel ( mac ) problem with an equivalent noise at the receiver characterized by a certain positive semidefinite covariance matrix , which is then solved by applying a fixed - point iteration @xcite . in this paper , this particular type of uplink - downlink duality is extended to the more challenging case when the equivalent noise covariance matrix in the dual mac is not necessarily positive semidefinite , as a result of the new consideration of joint information and energy transmission ,    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "we consider a multiuser miso downlink system for swipt over one single frequency band as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "it is assumed that there are @xmath34 i d receivers and @xmath35 eh receivers , denoted by the sets @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    ", we consider linear precoding at the transmitter for swipt and each id / eh receiver is assigned with one dedicated information / energy transmission beam without loss of generality .",
    "hence , the transmitted signal from the ap is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the beamforming vectors for i d receiver @xmath15 and eh receiver @xmath43 , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the information - bearing signal for i d receiver @xmath15 and energy - carrying signal for eh receiver @xmath43 , respectively .",

    "suppose that the ap has a transmit sum - power constraint @xmath48 ; from ( [ equa : jnl:1 ] ) we thus have @xmath49 .",
    "we assume a quasi - static fading environment and denote @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the channel vectors from the ap to i d receiver @xmath15 and eh receiver @xmath43 , respectively , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( to be consistent with our proposed distance - based information / energy transmission scheduling ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we also make the following assumptions throughout the paper on the channel independence of different users , which are valid for practical wireless channels in e.g. rich - scattering environments .",
    "[ assumption1 ] the channel vector @xmath55 s and @xmath56 s are independently drawn from a set of continuous distribution function @xmath57 s and @xmath58 s , respectively , @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that for any @xmath60 matrix @xmath61 with @xmath62 , in which the @xmath63 row vectors constitute any subset of channel vectors from @xmath55 s and @xmath56 s , it holds with probability one that : i ) @xmath64 ; and ii ) the @xmath63 ( ordered ) non - zero singular values of @xmath61 , denoted by @xmath65 , are strictly decreasing , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "it is further assumed that the ap knows perfectly the instantaneous values of @xmath67 s and @xmath56 s , and each receiver knows its own instantaneous channel .",
    "the discrete - time baseband signal at the @xmath15th i d receiver is thus given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noise at the @xmath15th i d receiver . with linear",
    "transmit precoding , each i d receiver is interfered with by all other non - intended information beams and energy beams .",
    "since energy beams carry no information but instead pseudorandom signals can be assumed to be known at both the ap and each i d receiver prior to data transmission , their resulting interference can be cancelled at each i d receiver if this additional operation is implemented .",
    "we thus consider two types of i d receivers , namely type i and type ii i d receivers , which do not possess and possess the capability of cancelling the interference due to energy signals , respectively .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath15th i d receiver of type i or type ii , the corresponding sinr is accordingly expressed as @xmath70 @xmath71 on the other hand , for wireless energy transfer , due to the broadcast property of wireless channels , the energy carried by all information and energy beams , i.e. , both @xmath72 s and @xmath73 s , can be harvested at each eh receiver . as a result ,",
    "the harvested power for the @xmath43th eh receiver , denoted by @xmath74 , is proportional to the total power received @xcite , i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the energy harvesting efficiency .",
    "our aim is to maximize the weighted sum - power transferred to all eh receivers subject to individual sinr constraints at different i d receivers , given by @xmath77 .",
    "denote @xmath78 as the given energy weight for eh receiver @xmath43 , @xmath79 , where larger weight value of @xmath78 indicates higher priority of transferring energy to eh receiver @xmath43 as compared to other eh receivers .",
    "define @xmath80 .",
    "then from ( [ equa : jnl:5 ] ) the weighted sum - power harvested by all eh receivers can be expressed as @xmath81 .",
    "the design problems by assuming that all i d receivers are of either type i or type ii are thus formulated accordingly as follows .",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83 notice that the only difference between @xmath84 and @xmath85 lies in the achievable sinr expression for each i d receiver @xmath86 .",
    "both problems @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be shown to maximize a convex quadratic function with @xmath87 being positive semidefinite , i.e. , @xmath88 , subject to various quadratic constraints ; thus they are both non - convex qcqps @xcite , for which the globally optimal solutions are difficult to be obtained efficiently in general .    prior to solving these two problems",
    ", we first have a check on their feasibility , i.e. , whether a given set of sinr constraints for i d receivers can be met under the given transmit sum - power constraint @xmath48 .",
    "it can be observed from @xmath89 and @xmath90 that both problems are feasible if and only if their feasibility is guaranteed by ignoring all the eh receivers , i.e. , setting @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath93 . for convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath94 in this case .",
    "thus , the feasibility of both @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be verified by solving the following problem : @xmath95 problem ( [ equa : jnl:6 ] ) can be solved by the standard interior point method via transforming it into a second - order cone program ( socp ) @xcite or by an uplink - downlink duality based fixed - point iteration algorithm @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the other extreme case with no i d receivers , i.e. , @xmath96 , where by setting @xmath97 , both @xmath89 and @xmath90 are reduced to @xmath98 let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of @xmath101 , respectively",
    ". then it can be easily shown that the optimal value of ( [ equa : jnl:7 ] ) is @xmath102 , which is attained by setting @xmath103 for any set of @xmath104 satisfying @xmath105 .",
    "accordingly , all energy beams are aligned to the same direction as @xmath106 .",
    "thus , without loss of optimality , we can set @xmath107 for any @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "for convenience , we refer to the beamformer in the form of @xmath110 as the optimal energy beamformer ( oebf ) .",
    "finally , we consider another special case with all @xmath111 s being sufficiently small ( but still non - zero in general ) , namely the `` oebf - feasible '' case , in which aligning all information beams to the oebf is feasible for both @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in other words , there exists a solution to the feasibility problem ( [ equa : jnl:6 ] ) given by @xmath112 with @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 , i.e. , the following problem has a feasible solution given by @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 in this case , it is easy to verify that the optimal values of both problems @xmath89 and @xmath90 are @xmath102 , which is the same as that of problem ( [ equa : jnl:7 ] ) and can be attained by @xmath117 satisfying @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , i.e. , no dedicated energy beam is needed to achieve the maximum weighted sum - power for eh receivers . to check whether the oebf - feasible case occurs or not",
    ", we only need to solve the feasibility problem in ( [ equation : eoebfcheck ] ) which is a simple linear program ( lp ) .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper , we will mainly focus on the unaddressed non - trivial case so far when @xmath89 and @xmath90 are both feasible but aligning all information beams to the oebf is infeasible for both problems , unless otherwise specified .",
    "in this section , we study the two non - convex qcqps in @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and derive their optimal solutions via sdr . for non - convex qcqps , it is known that sdr is an efficient approach to obtain good approximate solutions in general @xcite . in the following , by applying sdr and exploiting the specific problem structures , the globally optimal solutions for both @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "are obtained efficiently .",
    "first , consider problem @xmath89 for the case of type i i d receivers .",
    "define the following matrices : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "then , it follows that @xmath122 and @xmath123 . by ignoring the above rank constraints on @xmath124 s and @xmath125 , the sdr of @xmath89 is given by @xmath126",
    "let the optimal solution of @xmath127 be @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "then we have the following proposition .    [ proposition:3.1 ] under the condition of independently distributed user channels given in assumption [ assumption1 ] ,",
    "the optimal solution of @xmath127 for the case of type i i d receivers satisfies : @xmath130 , and @xmath131    see appendix [ appendix:1 ] .    from proposition [ proposition:3.1 ] , it follows that the optimal solution of @xmath127 satisfies the desired rank constraints , and thus the globally optimal solution of @xmath89 can always be obtained by solving @xmath127 .",
    "note that @xmath127 is a semidefinite program ( sdp ) , which can be efficiently solved by existing software , e.g. , @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that the optimal solution satisfies that @xmath133 for @xmath127 or equivalently @xmath134 for @xmath89 , which implies that no dedicated energy beam is needed for achieving the maximum weighted sum harvested power in @xmath89 .",
    "this can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "since type i i d receivers can not cancel the interference from energy beams ( if any ) , employing energy beams will increase the interference power and as a result degrade the sinr at i d receivers .",
    "thus , the optimal transmission strategy is to adjust the weights and power allocation of information beams only to maximize the weighted sum - power transferred to eh receivers .",
    "next , consider problem @xmath90 for the case of type ii i d receivers .",
    "similar to @xmath89 , the sdr of @xmath90 can be expressed as @xmath135 let the optimal solution of @xmath136 be @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we then have the following proposition .    [ proposition:3.2 ] under the condition of independently distributed user channels given in assumption [ assumption1 ] ,",
    "the optimal solution of @xmath136 for the case of type ii i d receivers satisfies : @xmath139 , @xmath140 ; furthermore , it holds that @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "see appendix [ appendix:2 ] .",
    "based on proposition [ proposition:3.2 ] , we can obtain the globally optimal solution of @xmath90 by solving @xmath143 via @xmath132 .",
    "meanwhile , since @xmath141 , all energy beams should be aligned to @xmath106 , the same direction as the oebf .",
    "similar to problem ( [ equa : jnl:7 ] ) , in this case , we can choose to send only one energy beam to minimize the complexity of beamforming implementation at the transmitter as well as the energy signal interference cancellation at all i d receivers by setting @xmath144 for any @xmath108 and @xmath145 .    by comparing the optimal solutions for @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    ", we can see that their main difference lies in that whether or not energy beamforming is employed .",
    "note that the optimal value of @xmath90 is in general an upper bound on that of @xmath89 since any feasible solution of @xmath89 is also feasible for @xmath90 , but not vice versa . if @xmath146 in proposition [ proposition:3.2 ] , then the upper bound is tight ; however , if @xmath147 , then a higher weighted sum harvested power is achievable for eh receivers with type ii i d receivers .",
    "therefore , the benefit of using type ii i d receivers can be realized by employing no more than one energy beam and at the cost of implementing an additional interference cancellation ( with _ a priori _ known energy signals ) at i d receivers .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out an interesting case with one single i d receiver , for which energy beamforming is always not needed , as stated in the following proposition .",
    "[ proposition : ki1 ] for the case of type ii i d receivers , if @xmath148 , then the optimal solution of @xmath136 satisfies that @xmath149 .",
    "see appendix [ appendix:8 ] .",
    "in the previous section , we have obtained the globally optimal solutions for our formulated qcqp problems by applying the technique of sdr . in order to provide further insight to the optimal solution structure , in this section we propose an alternative approach for solving the non - convex problems @xmath89 and @xmath90 by applying the principle of uplink - downlink duality .",
    "it is worth noting that the fundamental reason that some apparently non - convex downlink beamforming problems ( e.g. , the transmit power minimization problem in @xcite ) can be solved globally optimally via uplink - downlink duality is that they can be recast as certain convex forms ( e.g. , see the socp reformulation for the problem in @xcite ) , and thus strong duality holds for these problems .",
    "however , for the two non - convex qcqps in @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we can not explicitly recast them as convex problems .",
    "nevertheless , our result in section [ sec : sdp ] that the sdrs of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are both tight implies that strong duality may also hold for them .",
    "this thus motivates our investigation of a new form of uplink - downlink duality for solving these two problems , as will be shown next .",
    "consider @xmath89 for the case with type i i d receivers at first . according to proposition [ proposition:3.1 ] and under assumption [ assumption1 ]",
    ", dedicated energy beamforming is not needed to achieve the optimal solution of @xmath89 ; thus , we can set @xmath150 , and accordingly , @xmath151 , similar to ( [ equa : jnl:6 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath89 is reformulated as the following problem . @xmath152    by denoting @xmath153 as the dual variable associated with the transmit sum - power constraint in @xmath154,[multiblock footnote omitted ] we can express the dual function of @xmath154 as @xmath155 accordingly , the dual problem of @xmath154 is defined as @xmath156    since @xmath154 is known to be non - convex , weak duality holds for @xmath154 and @xmath157 in general , i.e. , the optimal value of @xmath157 serves as an upper bound on that of @xmath154 .",

    "specifically , we first solve problem ( [ equa : jnl:8 ] ) for obtaining @xmath158 with any given @xmath153 , and then search over @xmath159 to find the optimal @xmath160 for minimizing @xmath158 , as will be shown in the following two steps , respectively .",
