    "fluorescence telescopes record the longitudinal profile of extensive air showers induced by very energetic cosmic rays through the detection of the fluorescence light generated by secondary charged particles .",
    "this technique allows an accurate determination of the shower maximum depth @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , since the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the deposited energy , the integration in depth of the fluorescence profile allows a calorimetric determination of the shower energy .",
    "the total primary energy is later obtained by applying a correction accounting for the so - called missing energy .",
    "a key parameter for the reconstruction of the calorimetric energy is the fluorescence yield ( fy ) , defined as the number of fluorescence photons emitted per unit deposited energy .",
    "the fy which depends on the atmospheric parameters ( i.e. pressure @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 , humidity ) is measured in dedicated laboratory experiments .",
    "presently one of the largest contributions to the total systematic error in the primary energy comes from the absolute value of this parameter .",
    "also the uncertainties in the dependence of the fy on atmospheric parameters might have a non - negligible effect on both primary energy and @xmath0 measurements .    in this paper a simple procedure to study the effect of the assumed fluorescence yield on the reconstructed shower parameters will be shown .",
    "preliminary results were published in  @xcite . in section  [ sec : afy ] a brief summary of the fy properties will be presented . in the next section the features of some data sets of fy commonly used will be described and compared . a simple method to evaluate the effect of the fy selection on shower reconstruction",
    "is shown in section 4 .",
    "the shower development will be described by a gaisser - hillas profile .",
    "the effect of a variation in the fy ( including its atmospheric dependence ) is a change in the reconstructed longitudinal development of the deposited energy which can be easily evaluated .",
    "results for the dependence of both reconstructed @xmath0 and primary energy on the fy selection will be presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "keilhauer and unger  @xcite have carried out a similar study focused on estimating the influence of the atmospheric conditions on the reconstructed shower parameters .",
    "however our approach is somewhat different since we only need the gaisser - hillas profile , while in  @xcite simulated showers are used for the analysis .",
    "air - fluorescence in the near uv range is basically produced by the de - excitation of atmospheric nitrogen molecules excited by the shower electrons .",
    "the spectrum of fluorescence consists of a set of molecular bands represented by their wavelengths @xmath3 and therefore the total fluorescence yield @xmath4 in a given wavelength interval @xmath5 can be obtained by adding up the contributions of all the molecular bands @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 excited molecules can also decay by collisions with an environmental molecule . because of this effect , the fy in the absence of quenching @xmath8 ( that is , at null pressure ) is reduced by the so - called stern - volmer factor . @xmath9",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 on atmospheric conditions can be described by a single parameter , the characteristic pressure @xmath10 which is defined as the pressure for which both radiative and collisional de - excitation have the same probability . in general @xmath10 contains a contribution of all possible quenchers @xmath11 ( i.e. , n@xmath12 , o@xmath12 , h@xmath12o ) .",
    "@xmath13 in the above expressions @xmath14 is the fraction of molecules of type @xmath11 in the mixture , @xmath15 is the collisional cross section which depends on the particular band , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the relative velocity and reduced mass of the two body system n - i respectively ; @xmath18 is the boltzman constant and @xmath19 the radiative lifetime of the corresponding level .",
    "a number of experimental results of the fy in dry air are available ( a review is presented in  @xcite and a critical comparison of the absolute measurements can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "usually the absolute values of @xmath6 are measured at atmospheric pressure and room temperature and the @xmath10 parameters are evaluated at the same temperature .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fy ] ) allows the determination of @xmath20 and the dependence of the fy with pressure .",
    "unfortunately measurements of the @xmath10 parameters show large discrepancies and therefore the @xmath20 parameter is not suitable for comparison between different experiments .    according to expression  ( [ eq:1_p ] ) , the @xmath10 value for dry air can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fraction of oxygen and nitrogen molecules in air respectively .",
    "measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are also available  @xcite .",
    "water molecules are also effective quenchers for excited @xmath26 and therefore fluorescence emission is partly suppressed in humid air .",
    "the characteristic pressure for humid air @xmath27 can be calculated from equation  ( [ eq:1_p ] ) by including the water contribution .",
    "the relationship between the characteristic pressures of dry @xmath28 and humid air @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the partial pressure of water and @xmath32 is the characteristic pressure for fluorescence quenching by collisions with water molecules .",
    "measurements of @xmath32 values have been performed by several authors .",
    "the airfly collaboration has published results for four bands at 293 k  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite experimental values of @xmath32 for three relevant bands are also reported .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the fluorescence yield is given by equations  ( [ eq : fy ] ) and  ( [ eq:1_p ] ) .",
    "neglecting the dependence of the collisional cross section on the kinetic energy of the colliders , @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "assuming a measurement of the characteristic pressure at a reference temperature @xmath34 , the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 however , as it is well known , the average collisional cross section follows a behavior which can be described by a power law ( @xmath37 )  @xcite",
    ". therefore equation  ( [ eq : pprime_vart ] ) becomes @xmath38 the dependence of the fy with both @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be easily predicted by combining equations  ( [ eq : fy ] ) , ( [ eq:1_p ] ) and ( [ eq : pprime_mod ] ) . the temperature dependence of the collisional cross section for dry air has been measured recently by the airfly collaboration and the corresponding values of @xmath39 parameter for four molecular bands have been published  @xcite . in principle , this parameter depends on the quencher ( nitrogen , oxygen , water )",
    ". however independent measurements of @xmath40 for each air component is difficult and usually it is assumed that @xmath40 takes the same value for all components . on the other hand @xmath39 values for water are not presently available .",
    "however , as we will show below all these uncertainties and approximations have a marginal impact on the shower reconstruction .",
    "the reconstruction of the shower parameters requires the following information on the fluorescence yield .    * the absolute value in dry air at a given pressure and temperature for all bands within the spectral range of the telescope . as an alternative",
    ", the absolute value for a reference transition ( e.g. 337 nm ) and the relative intensities of the bands at a given pressure will also provide the total fluorescence yield . * the values of @xmath10 in dry air at a reference temperature for all bands .",

    "the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath15 for all wavelengths . in principle",
    "@xmath44 values for each quencher would be needed , however this information is , at present , rather limited .",

    "finally , 4 ) provides a more accurate extrapolation at temperatures far from the reference one ( i.e. at high altitude ) .",
    "apart from pioneering works  @xcite , in the last 10 years several measurements of the fy have been carried out in laboratory experiments injecting accelerated electrons into air targets  @xcite . nowadays",
    "three data sets combining some of these measurements are mainly being used in cosmic ray experiments using fluorescence telescopes .",
    "they are those of kakimoto - bunner , nagano and the combination nagano - airfly .",
    "these data sets are described below . in all of them",
    "the humidity effect is neglected and the @xmath2 dependence of quenching is calculated assuming a constant collisional cross section . the effect of these approximations on the fluorescence yield is not negligible and will be also evaluated in this section .",
    "this fy data set which was used by the hires collaboration in 2001  @xcite is a combination of fluorescence yield measurements of kakimoto et al .",
    "@xcite and the relative intensities of the molecular bands reported by bunner  @xcite .",
    "kakimoto et al . measured the absolute value of the air - fluorescence yield expressed in photons per meter @xmath46 for the three primary molecular bands of nitrogen ( 337 , 357 and 391 nm ) at 1000 hpa and 288 k. the remaining fluorescence bands are found to contribute with about a 30% of the total fluorescence photons when the filter employed in the hires telescopes ( bandpass filter between 295 and 405 nm ) is considered . as pointed out by  @xcite , these data translate into an absolute fy contribution of 0.46 ph / m for these bands .",
    "the remaining fluorescence spectrum ( 13 bands ) is distributed according to the relative intensities collected by bunner  @xcite .",
    "kakimoto et al . calculated the fluorescence efficiency of the primary bands ( defined as the fraction of deposited energy emitted as fluorescence radiation ) @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the planck constant",
    ", @xmath50 is the speed of light , @xmath51 is the energy deposited by the electron per unit of atmospheric depth , and @xmath52 is the air density .",
    "experimental results of pressure dependence for the primary bands are also reported by kakimoto et al . in that work",
    "the fy is parameterized as @xmath53 in this expression @xmath54 is the number of photons emitted per electron and unit column density ( g/@xmath55 ) in the absence of quenching ( i.e. @xmath1=0 ) and the @xmath56 parameter is related with the characteristic pressure through  ( [ eq : fy ] ) and ( [ eq:1_p ] ) by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the specific gas constant .",
    "the implementation of @xmath47 and @xmath56 in equation  ( [ eq:1_p ] ) can be easily performed .",
    "firstly , the fluorescence yield is related with the fluorescence efficiency by @xmath59 therefore the @xmath8 values can be obtained from the fluorescence efficiency at @xmath60=1000 hpa and the @xmath56 parameters at @xmath34 = 288 k from @xmath61 finally , the values of @xmath62 inferred from the reported @xmath56 parameters of kakimoto for the 337 nm band are used for all 2p components while that of the 391 nm is used for the 1n system .",
    "nagano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite provided experimental results of @xmath46 in dry air for 15 nitrogen bands at 1013 hpa and 293 k as well as the corresponding @xmath62 values at the same temperature .",
    "using these measurements , the authors calculate the fluorescence efficiency at null pressure @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 values can be easily obtained applying expression  ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "notice that both kakimoto and nagano assume for this calculation that the energy lost by the electron is fully deposited in the field of view of the experimental set - up .",
    "implication of this approximation has been discussed in @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .      in this data set the absolute scale is given by the @xmath64 value reported by nagano for the 337 nm band which translates into a @xmath65 value of 6.38 ph / mev at @xmath60=800 hpa and @xmath34=293 k. relative intensities @xmath66 at @xmath34 and @xmath60 for 34 wavelengths and the corresponding @xmath67 values in dry air at 293k reported by airfly  @xcite are used to get a complete set .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 for any wavelength is thus obtained as @xmath68 this data set is presently used by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "the fy for the above described data sets has been compared . in figure",
    "[ fig : fy2 ] the ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 against atmospheric depth are shown .",
    "the large deviations observed at low depth are due to discrepancies in the @xmath10 values in the data sets .",
    "obviously these discrepancies have no relevant impact in shower reconstruction since in our energy range they take place before the development of the shower . on the other hand , at larger depths differences around 20% between n - a and k - b data sets are found while a relative small discrepancy of around 2% is observed between n - a and nagano descriptions .        in practice",
    "the comparison between fy data sets should include other ingredients .",
    "fluorescence photons generated by cosmic ray showers are detected with ground telescopes located at a large distance from the emission point and thus suffering a non - negligible attenuation which is wavelength dependent .",
    "in addition , the optical systems of the telescope , including the filter , the mirror and the pmt photocathode have a response which is also wavelength dependent . therefore the relative differences between two fy data sets are not directly translated to the energy reconstruction since the relative intensities of the molecular bands are modified by the detector efficiency .",
    "for instance , discrepancies between two data sets which only affect wavelength regions for which the filter has a low transmittance might have a marginal impact on energy reconstruction although the discrepancy in total fy is large .",
    "the parameter more closely related with possible deviations in the shower reconstruction is the product @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the optical efficiency of the telescopes including all components and @xmath73 represents the atmospheric transmittance between the emission point and the telescope location .",
    "the effect of the optical filter is particularly relevant in the comparison between k - b and n - a data sets .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fy2 ] the large disagreement between them nearly disappears when the efficiency of the optical system of the auger telescopes @xcite is included .",
    "figure  [ fig : fy3 ] shows the fluorescence yield for both data sets ( left ) and the effect of the optical efficiency ( right ) .",
    "note that the large discrepancy in the bin centered at 317 nm is smoothed by the strong absorption of the filter at this wavelength .",
    "however the discrepancies at wavelengths with good transmission , and thus less sensitive to the filter , nearly compensate each other .    in a similar way",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that the large disagreement between the nagano and k - b data sets are significantly reduced when the optical efficiency of hires is included .",
    "the above described data sets do not include the contribution of quenching by water molecules in humid air .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of the characteristic pressure is assumed to follow a @xmath33 law ( i.e. @xmath39 is assumed to be zero ) .",
    "the effect of these approximations on the fy profile has been evaluated using the monthly average description for the atmosphere measured at the auger site  @xcite . as an example , in figure [ fig : fy_ht ] the effect of including the humidity and temperature corrections ( december month ) in the n - a data set is shown against atmospheric depth . for these calculations the quenching parameters of  @xcite have been used .",
    "as expected , humidity decreases the fluorescence yield at large depth ( i.e. near ground ) while the effect of the @xmath2 term is only relevant at high altitudes . neglecting the possible dependence of the collisional cross section n@xmath74-h@xmath12o with @xmath2 ( i.e. assuming @xmath39 is zero for water )",
    ", the total effect of humidity and temperature can be easily computed . the result is also shown in figure  [ fig : fy_ht ] .",
    "a similar behavior has been found in a study carried out in @xcite using several sets of fluorescence yield data including the temperature and humidity dependence of quenching from various authors .",
    "as expected , neither the optical efficiency of the detector nor the atmospheric transmission introduce any significant effect in these results since atmospheric conditions ( i.e. temperature and humidity ) has a negligible impact on the fluorescence spectrum .",
    "in this note we propose a simple procedure to evaluate the effect of the fluorescence yield selection on the reconstruction of shower parameters . assuming a certain longitudinal profile of deposited energy @xmath75 , the number of fluorescence photons generated per unit atmospheric depth is determined by the fluorescence yield in the wavelength interval of the telescope .",
    "@xmath76    the total calorimetric energy @xmath77 can be obtained from the integral of the longitudinal profile and therefore @xmath78    if the fy assumption is now changed to a new data set @xmath79 , the profile of deposited energy consistent with the fluorescence profile is @xmath80 and thus the calorimetric energy associated to the new fy selection will be @xmath81 therefore , in principle , the effect of changing the fy selection on the primary energy can be evaluated by comparing ( [ ecal ] ) and ( [ ecal_mod2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect on the @xmath82 value can be obtained by comparing the shape of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 profiles .    only a small fraction of the fluorescence photons generated by the shower reaches the pmt camera of the fluorescence detector . in the first place ,",
    "the number of photons is strongly reduced by a factor @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the area of the telescope and @xmath87 is the distance from the emission point to the telescope location . in addition , as previously pointed out , the atmosphere scatters a non - negligible fraction of photons on their way to the telescope .",
    "finally the optical elements of the telescope also absorb a certain fraction of those photons reaching the telescope window .",
    "both atmospheric transmission and optical efficiency are wavelength dependent .",
    "therefore the profile of deposited energy is calculated from the profile of observed photons using the expression @xmath88 and thus , relationship ( [ eq : new_dep ] ) becomes @xmath89 therefore the shower maximum depth has to be evaluated using ( [ eq : new_dep_eff ] ) instead of ( [ eq : new_dep ] ) and the calorimetric energy @xmath90 inferred from the new fy selection is given by @xmath91 the variation of both @xmath82 and @xmath77 due to a change in the fy selection is not sensitive to the fine details of the longitudinal development of @xmath83 and thus instead of using real data or simulated showers it is easier and more convenient for this study to describe the longitudinal development of deposited energy by a gaisser - hillas ( gh ) profile  @xcite given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath3 are shape parameters and @xmath82 is the shower maximum depth .",
    "we have studied the impact of the fy selection for proton and iron showers with zenith angle @xmath94 of 30@xmath95 and 60@xmath95 and fixed primary energies @xmath96 of 10@xmath97 and 10@xmath98 ev .",
    "the corresponding calorimetric energies have been calculated assuming an invisible energy as parameterized by  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath93 , @xmath3 and @xmath82 have been obtained by fitting the average longitudinal development of a sample of corsika showers  @xcite to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gh ] ) .",
    "these longitudinal developments are fully compatible with those shown in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath99 is obtained as a normalization constant to account for the total deposited energy .        for a given energy ,",
    "the shower reaches its maximum development at an altitude which grows with @xmath94 and therefore , since the fy varies with altitude ( through pressure , temperature and humidity ) , the impact of the fy selection depends on the shower geometry .",
    "the effect of atmospheric transmission increases with the distance between the telescope and the shower axis .",
    "values of 10 and 30 km have been tried for this parameter . as already mentioned the atmosphere has been modeled using monthly average profiles measured at the auger site  @xcite .    as an example",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : gh_1 ] the effect in the profile of deposited energy of a 10@xmath97 ev proton shower when changing from @xmath100 to @xmath101 fluorescence yield .",
    "the black solid line is the gh profile for a shower with an @xmath96 value of @xmath102  ev .",
    "the red dashed line represents the ratio @xmath103 ( red axis on the right ) as a function of depth . applying ( [ eq : new_dep ] ) ,",
    "the modified profile ( i.e. , the profile of deposited energy which would be obtained using the k - b fluorescence yield ) , has been calculated ( red dotted line ) .",
    "the integral of this profile results in a total deposited energy significantly larger ( by about a 20% ) .",
    "however when taking into account the effect of the optical efficiency , the ratio @xmath104 is close to unity except at very low atmospheric depth ( dashed blue line measured in the blue axis on the right ) and therefore the reconstructed profile from expression ( [ eq : new_dep_eff ] ) ( dotted blue ) is nearly unaffected giving a deviation in the deposited energy around 2% in full agreement with previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the atmospheric transmission does not introduce significant differences between fy data sets in this case .",
    "this example has been calculated using the atmospheric profile of december .",
    "similar results have been found for other seasons .",
    "the effect of humidity and that of a @xmath2-dependent collisional cross section has also been studied with this method .",
    "some typical examples are shown in figures [ fig : gh_hum ] and [ fig : gh_temp ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : gh_hum ] the effect of water vapor ( december month ) in the n - a data set for a fe shower of @xmath105 ev and @xmath94 angles of 30@xmath95 and 60@xmath95 is studied .",
    "the development of the shower depends on the slant depth and therefore the smaller is @xmath94 , the closer to the ground the maximum shower development is reached . since humidity is stronger at low altitudes , its effect is more important for vertical showers . in this case",
    "the calorimetric energy has to be increased by about a 4% at 30@xmath95 while at 60@xmath95 the correction is negligible ( @xmath106 1% ) . on the contrary",
    "the effect of neglecting the @xmath2 dependence of the collisional cross section is stronger at low temperatures ( i.e. at high altitudes ) since the @xmath34 value at which the fy is measured are close to that at ground .",
    "this feature can be observed in figure  [ fig : gh_temp ] for the same kind of shower assuming the same atmospheric profile . in this case",
    "the effect of temperature can be corrected by increasing @xmath77 by about 2% ( 6% ) at 30@xmath95 ( 60@xmath95 ) .",
    "the corresponding effect of the correction on the shower maximum depth is also displayed in the above figures .",
    "as expected the @xmath82 value increases ( decreases ) if the slope of the fy ratio versus depth function at @xmath107 is negative ( positive ) .",
    "the longitudinal profiles have been calculated until the showers reaches ground level that in the case of the auger site corresponds to a vertical atmospheric depth of about 880 g@xmath108 .",
    "the method described above has been used to predict the impact of various fy assumptions on the shower reconstruction . the relative difference in reconstructed primary energy between several fy selections and the n",
    "- a one @xmath109 has been calculated as well as the absolute difference of the shower maximum depth @xmath110 .",
    "the effect of the optical efficiency of the telescope  @xcite ( in particular that of the filter ) and the atmospheric absorption to these deviations has also been evaluated .",
    "as already mentioned the contribution of the invisible energy has been calculated following the parameterization of  @xcite . since typical variations in deposited energy due to the fy selection",
    "are smaller than 10% and the invisible energy contributes an amount ranging from 8% and 12% , the corresponding deviations in @xmath96 are smaller than the one of the calorimetric energy by as much as one percent unit .    in the first place the fy data sets of k - b and nagano have been compared with the n - a one .",
    "the results for total energy are displayed in tables  [ table_1 ] ( 10@xmath98 ev ) and [ table_2 ] ( 10@xmath97 ev ) while those of @xmath82 are shown in tables  [ table_3 ] ( 10@xmath98 ev ) and [ table_4 ] ( 10@xmath97 ev ) . as can be seen in tables  [ table_1 ] and [ table_2 ]",
    ", the nagano fy would lead to a small decrease in energy ( around or smaller than 2% ) without any additional relevant effect when the optical efficiency of the fluorescence telescope or the atmospheric transmission is included in the calculation . on the contrary , using the k - b fy would give rise to a significant energy increase of nearly 20% .",
    "however , as anticipated in the previous section , this deviation is reduced down to about 2% when the optical efficiency of other components are included as pointed out by  @xcite . in particular",
    "the filter reduces this nearly 20% energy increase down to about 7% , with the optical efficiency of the remaining components of the telescope responsible for the further decrease down to that final 2% .",
    "the effect of the atmospheric transmission is basically negligible    . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in regard to @xmath82 reconstruction , using the fy data sets of nagano or k - b would decrease the shower maximum depth by about 1 g@xmath108 ( see tables  [ table_3 ] and [ table_4 ] ) .",
    "the effect of the atmospheric transmission is nearly negligible .",
    "these results both of reconstructed energy and maximum depth are basically independent on primary energy and shower angle .",
    "as expected , they are also nearly independent of season .",
    "the effect of the humidity and the @xmath2-dependent collisional cross section on the n - a data set has also been studied . as already mentioned",
    "these effects vary with geometry and season due to the different atmospheric conditions undergone by the shower track , as well as with the nature of the primary ( mass and energy ) due to the different longitudinal development .",
    "when the water vapour quenching is taken into account , large deviations in the calorimetric energy ( up to 7% ) are found for humid months ( e.g. february ) and shower maximum close to ground ( i.e. , either high energy , light primary , vertical incidence or a combination of them ) .",
    "this deviation lowers down to about 1% at 60@xmath95 .",
    "the effect of a collisional cross - section dependent on temperature ranges from 6.5% for inclined showers to about 2% for vertical ones .",
    "the total effect in the primary energy is displayed for all months in figure  [ fig : delta_e ] .",
    "excluding the february - may period , it ranges typically between 5.5 and 6.5% .",
    "notice the significant variation of @xmath111 with season for vertical showers , which is due to the humidity effect .",
    "the correction in shower maximum depth due to the temperature effect is @xmath112 - 5 g@xmath108 , nearly independent on the shower and atmospheric features while the correction for the humidity effect ranges from about 8 g@xmath108 for vertical showers in austral summer down to about 1 g@xmath108 at 60@xmath95 .",
    "the total @xmath82 deviations including both effects are displayed for all months in figure  [ fig : delta_x ] . as can be seen in this figure , the corrections for inclined showers are negative and nearly season independent .",
    "this behaviour was expected since the slope of the function fy ratio versus depth is positive for the @xmath2 effect ( see figure  [ fig : fy_ht ] ) and , as already mentioned , the temperature profile is nearly constant along the year . on the contrary",
    "the correction for vertical showers is strongly dependent on the month again due to the humidity effect .    the experimental analysis of the fluorescence quenching due to water vapor as well as that of the temperature dependence of the quenching cross section is rather difficult .",
    "as a consequence these measurements are very scarce and subject to large uncertainties .",
    "the procedure presented here can be used for the evaluation of the effects of the errors in the @xmath32 and @xmath113 parameters on the total uncertainty of the reconstructed values of the shower energy and @xmath0 . for this purpose",

    "is very small .",
    "the largest effect is found for high humidity months and/or showers more sensitive to @xmath2 and humidity effects .",
    "for instance for 30@xmath95 protons of 10@xmath98 ev the 8% increase in energy for the february month would move within the 6% to 10% interval while the corresponding shift in maximum depth of @xmath115 = 9 g@xmath108 remains unchanged . for the same kind of shower ( p , 30@xmath95 , 10@xmath98 ev )",
    "the 5% energy increase in the august month would be within the 3 to 6% interval and the negligible @xmath82 effect reported in fig .",

    "the longitudinal development of the shower is described by a gaisser - hillas profile which is slightly modified by a variation in the fy assumption .",
    "several data sets of fy including absolute values , wavelength spectra , as well as pressure , temperature and humidity dependencies have been used for this study .    using this simple procedure",
    "we have confirmed that the nagano - airfly , nagano and kakimoto - bunner data sets lead to close values ( within around a 2% ) of the reconstructed energy , as long as the optical efficiency of the auger telescopes is taken into account .",
    "the corresponding effects on @xmath82 are typically smaller than 1 g@xmath108 .    the dependence of the fy with atmospheric properties ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and humidity ) and its effect on reconstructed parameters of the shower have also been analyzed .",
    "these effects , when combined , introduce typical deviations at the level of 6% in the reconstructed primary energy .",
    "however significantly larger deviations can be found for vertical showers ( 30@xmath95 ) in humid months .",
    "the deviations induced in @xmath82 by temperature and humidity are opposite and they nearly cancel when combined . deviations of about -4 g@xmath108 are found for inclined showers ( 60@xmath95 ) while for vertical ones the effect is strongly dependent on humidity with large positive deviations in some months .    these deviations in primary energy and @xmath116 values are not negligible when compared with typical uncertainties ( both systematic and statistical ) in the reconstruction of the shower parameters .",
    "notice , however , that they can be easily corrected as far as the temperature and humidity effects are included in the reconstruction algorithms . on the other hand",
    ", we have found that even relatively large uncertainties in the quenching parameters associated to humidity or the t - dependence of the collisional cross section have not a significant impact on the reconstructed parameters .",
    "in fact the derived systematic uncertainties are below 2% for primary energy and below 2g@xmath108 for @xmath116 , and therefore they represent a small contribution to the total uncertainty in the reconstruction of the shower parameters .    the results shown here have been obtained from the whole longitudinal development of the fluorescence light . in a real case the reconstruction of the longitudinal development",
    "is restricted to an interval given by the field of view of the telescope .",
    "in addition , the contribution of cherenkov light is a very important ingredient in the reconstruction of real data @xcite not used in our simple procedure .",
    "these simplifications could give rise to small discrepancies between the predictions of our simple algorithm and those from the analysis of real data .",
    "nevertheless our results are basically in agreement with those of @xcite obtained from a detailed reconstruction of a sample of mc events .",
