    "the evidence for the production of a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) at rhic is very strong , however coming into this conference there are questions one would like to have answered .",
    "the hallmark signatures for the sqgp have been the suppression of high momentum particles , and the strong elliptic flow of hadrons .",
    "surprisingly , heavy quarks seen via their leptonic decays have shown a similar behavior .",
    "since both charm and bottom quarks decay leptonically , the first question one would like to answer is whether this behavior is limited to the charm quark , or includes the much heavier bottom quark as well .",
    "secondly , since strong elliptic flow indicates that the system is thermalized , one is led to ask whether the `` black body '' radiation from this thermalized system in the form of thermal dileptons can be seen .",
    "dileptons can pass through the system basically unhindered , hence they can give us information about the time evolution of the system - both from the aforementioned thermal radiation and from the decays of hadrons , or quasi - hadrons inside the high temperature region which may allow us to observe hadron masses and widths in a chirally symmetric phase . finally we will ask whether new results in the ongoing story of the j/@xmath0 can give us any indication of deconfinement .",
    "one of the most important early experimental results was the suppression of high momentum particles .",
    "the standard explanation for this effect is that high momentum quarks / gluons loose energy before exiting the medium .",
    "this signature is an indication of a very high energy density ; estimates range from 25 to 100 times the density of nuclear matter .",
    "the strength of the elliptic flow leads one to believe that thermalization occurs very early , probably @xmath11  fm / c@xcite though some recent estimates have been much earlier than this .",
    "this leads to a picture of quarks , even quarks of relatively high momentum , being thermalized rather quickly ( or nearly thermalized ) because of the strength of the interaction they experience .",
    "this could come from a large coupling constant , or from a smaller coupling constant together with a turbulent system@xcite .",
    "a striking , rather recent result , is that the interactions are so strong that heavy quarks such as charm also begin to thermalize and exhibit both suppression at high transverse momentum , and elliptic flow .",
    "charm and bottom quarks , were not expected to thermalize and flow with the medium because of their mass - m@xmath2 @xmath1 1.3 gev , m@xmath3 @xmath1 5 gev .",
    "in addition , if the suppression of high p@xmath4 particles is a consequence of radiative energy loss , then the `` dead - cone effect@xcite '' would mean that heavy quarks should show less suppression .",
    "heavy quarks have been observed using non - photonic electrons ( electrons spectra after the contribution of electrons from photon conversion and dalitz decays are subtracted ) which come from the semi - leptonic decay of both charm and bottom mesons .",
    "these indicate that heavy quarks are suppressed at high p@xmath4@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cbsuppflow ] , left ) .",
    "an update of the non - photonic electron flow is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbsuppflow ] ( right ) where the v@xmath5 , now shown out to a p@xmath4 of 5 gev , appears to saturate at about 0.07 .",
    "clearly charm flows and is suppressed at high p@xmath4 - what about bottom ? since heavy quarks are produced in the earliest moments of the collision via perturbative processes , their initial yield and p@xmath4 distribution in heavy ion collisions will be the same as in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions .",
    "both star and phenix have now made a measurement of the b / c ratio in p+p collisions .",
    "phenix uses a technique of examining the k+e invariant mass distribution from the d@xmath6 decay , subtracting off like sign combinations and fitting the result to a combination of b and c contributions .",
    "star uses a similar method but in addition they directly reconstruct the @xmath7 decay with an electron tag ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cb ] , left ) .",
    "[ fig : cb ] ( right ) shows the d/(d+b ) ratio obtained from the two experiments ; the results agree nicely with the fonll expectations .",
    "the implication is that bottom is responsible for a substantial part of the non - photonic electron signal - about 50% at p@xmath4 greater than 3 or 4 gev . taken together with the r@xmath8 and v@xmath5 results in au+au , this indicates that the b quark is at least partially thermalized in central au+au collisions and accounts for a non - negligible amount of the suppression and elliptic flow of non - photonic electrons .",
    "this is a very unexpected result since the relaxation time of the b - quark is much longer than that of the light quarks , because of its heavy mass .",
    "this would further imply that the strength of the interactions is strong - strong enough to force the bottom quarks to move with the bulk of the sqgp , hence non - perturbative calculations become necessary . a langevin based model which includes resonant elastic scattering obtains a good fit to both r@xmath8 and v@xmath5 with a diffusion coefficient d@xmath9=(4 to 6)/2@xmath10t@xcite .",
    "one can then make an estimate for @xmath11/s using transport models via the diffusion coefficient for heavy quarks .",
    "moore and teaney calculate , using perturbative methods that d@xmath9@xmath16@xmath11/(@xmath12+p)@xcite and give a plausibility argument that the result is true non - perturbatively .",
    "since at @xmath13=0 , @xmath12+p = ts , one arrives at an answer for @xmath11/s @xmath1 ( 1.3 to 2.0)/4@xmath10@xcite , close the the conjectured lower bound from ads / cft calculations@xcite which assume extremely strong interactions .",

    "as we explore the properties of the sqgp , we wish to obtain information from early times in the evolution of the collision .",
    "since they do not experience the strong interaction , leptons and photons are ideal messengers of information from deep within the fireball",
    ". they can give us vital information on two fronts .",
    "the first , via leptonic decays of hadrons ( or at least quasi - hadrons ) , is information on the characteristics of hadrons in the high temperature environment .",
    "they will tell us of modifications to the vacuum hadronic states - in particular - whether chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "dileptons and photons can also give information on the early temperature , via the black body radiation spectrum .",
    "leaving aside the question of whether the sqgp is formed at the sps or not , we turn to the na60 experiment which has made a precision measurement of the low mass dimuon spectrum in semi - central in+in collisions@xcite(see fig .  [",
    "fig : na60 ] , left ) .",
    "note that the atomic weight of in is 115 , about half the atomic weight of lead or gold used in previous sps experiments and rhic .",
    "the model of rapp and wambach where the @xmath15 spectral function is modified fits the invariant mass spectrum - the data is consistent with a broadening of the @xmath15 with no mass shift .",
    "this is an important result , as hadronic models are essentially an attempt to do many body qcd calculations below t@xmath16 and include an approach to the restoration of chiral symmetry as t@xmath16 is approached from below ( see @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical calculations show that baryons are important for this effect .",
    "when baryons are taken out of the calculation , the models are no longer able to explain the data .",
    "it then is reasonable to conjecture that the effect seen in na60 is a result of the baryon density at the sps .",
    "generally the modification of particle masses and widths are a slow function of the baryon density below the critical temperature . even at the baryon density of nuclear matter ,",
    "meson masses and widths are expected to be modified for low baryon density .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that in many of these models , even in rhic collisions where the net baryon density is low , broadening of the meson masses is due to baryons - however in this case it is due to the non - equilibrium presence of baryon and their corresponding antibaryons@xcite . ] .    in the model ,",
    "the excess on the high mass side of the @xmath15 is not explained . in order to study this region ,",
    "the na60 collaboration divided the data into sub - samples of varying invariant mass , and then fitted the p@xmath4 spectra of the sub - sample .",
    "the resultant slopes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : na60 ] ( right ) .",
    "they note that for masses below about 800 mev - i.e. below the @xmath15 - the slope of the p@xmath4 spectra rises .",
    "this is reminiscent of the mass dependent p@xmath4 spectra of hadrons - an indicator of radial flow of a hadronic source i.e. primarily the @xmath15 .",
    "the radial flow is built up in the later stages of the collision which is dominated by hadrons . above @xmath1800 mev , the slopes drop , which could be an indicator that the source of at least some of such dileptons are from earlier in the collision , i.e. before the radial flow develops@xcite .",
    "this might imply that the source is of a partonic nature .",
    "one of the new results shown at this conference by na60 was an analysis of the polarization by examining the polar angle of the excess dimuons in the collins soper frame . within errors",
    "the distribution is consistent with an unpolarized source as expected of thermal radiation@xcite .",

    "now we turn to the rhic data . in particular , since we have strong evidence for thermalization above the critical temperature , and since there is no doubt that qcd is the governing theory , we must detect thermal radiation , and chiral symmetry must be restored .",
    "what we would like to know is , a ) a measure of the temperatures involved and b ) the mechanism and consequences of the restoration of chiral symmetry . at this conference",
    "we have seen two crucial results from the phenix collaboration on this subject .",
    "the first is the observation of an excess in the dilepton spectrum over what would be predicted from a hadronic cocktail as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mee](left ) . in the figure ,",
    "the normalization of the p+p and cocktail spectra to the au+au data is done in the region of the @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig : mee](right ) shows that the @xmath15 broadening model which was successful in explaining the na60 data no longer works in the region of invariant mass between 150 and 750 mev .",
    "so far , no model appears able to explain the data .",
    "we then look at the general behavior of the excess as a function of centrality and transverse momentum .",
    "[ fig : mee_cent_pt](left ) shows the centrality dependence of the excess in three mass regions : the @xmath14 region where the data is normalized , a low mass region between 0.15 and 0.75 gev / c@xmath17 , and a high mass region between 1.2 and 2.8 gev / c@xmath17 . in the high mass region , the excess scales with binary collisions , and agrees with a cocktail which includes charm . in the low mass region , the excess increases with centrality",
    "the p@xmath4 dependence of the low mass region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mee_cent_pt](right ) .",
    "the excess is strongest in the lowest p@xmath4 bin ( 0 - 0.7 gev / c ) and is reduced at the highest p@xmath4 .",
    "the fact that the excess is strongest in the most central , low p@xmath4 collisions is consistent with the signal coming from a modified hadron in the fireball .",
    "particles at low p@xmath4 from central events , would have presumably been exposed for the longest time to the highest energy density region of the collision .",
    "the data is subdivided into bins of invariant mass , and the inverse slopes of the p@xmath4 distribution are fit . since there is clearly a strong p@xmath4 dependence which may indicate different sources , the fit is done in a low p@xmath4 region of @xmath18  gev/@xmath19 and an intermediate p@xmath4 region of @xmath20   gev/@xmath19 .",
    "the high p@xmath4 region ( with large error bars ) gives a rising inverse slope consistent with the source being the radial flow of modified hadrons ( the @xmath15 ? ) , albeit as mentioned previously , models including this effect can not completely describe the excess and alternate explanations may be in order .",
    "the low p@xmath4 region fits to a slope of about 120 mev / c@xmath17 which seems low to be from a partonic source in the sqgp since it is below any of the standard values of t@xmath16 from the lattice@xcite .",
