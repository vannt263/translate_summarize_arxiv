    "in this paper we are interested in possible origins of high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in neutron - star and black - hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and additionally in horizontal - branch qpos in luminous neutron - star lmxbs ( z sources ) .",
    "one of the important characteristics of khz qpos in neutron - star lmxbs is that they usually occur in a pair , and their frequencies change with time ( see , e.g. , van der klis 2000 , 2004 for reviews ) .",
    "the time change occurs in such a way as their frequency ratio decreases with an increase of frequencies . in the case of black - hole lmxbs ,",
    "high - frequency qpos usually also occur in a pair , but their frequencies change little with time , the ratio being kept close to 2 : 3 ( see van der klis 2004 for a review ) . in z sources ,",
    "another important characteristic of qpos is present .",
    "it is a strong correlation between khz qpos and horizontal branch qpos in their frequencies ( psaltis et al .",
    "that is , the frequency of the lower khz qpo , @xmath0 , and that of the horizontal branch qpos , @xmath1 , are correlated in each object so that @xmath2 .    paying attention to the closeness to 2 : 3 of the frequency ratio in high - frequency qpos in balck hole lmxbs , abramowicz and klu ' zniak ( 2001 ) and klu ' zniak and abramowicz ( 2001 ) presented a resonance model of disk oscillations to explain the qpos .",
    "on the other hand , the importance of an external deformation of disks on resonance processes has been emphasized by kato ( 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) , klu ' zniak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and lee , abramowicz , and klu ' zniak ( 2004 ) .",
    "kato ( 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) especially considered models of resonant oscillations on warped disks .",
    "the models were extended to a case where the warp had precession ( kato 2005 ) . in these warp models ,",
    "the temperature is assumed to always distribute isothermally in the vertical direction . in real situations ,",
    "however , this will not be the case .",
    "the vertical structure of disks will change by the difference of the disk state resulting from difference of the mass - accretion rate . considering this ,",
    "we assume in this paper that the pressure , density , and temperature distributions in the vertical direction are polytropic , and that the polytropic index changes with time . by adopting this model ,",
    "we can easily obtain the time variations of the resonant oscillations as a result of changes of the polytropic index .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate this generalization and to apply the results to qpos .    in warped disks",
    "there are four types of resonant oscillations due to the possible four combinations of two types of oscillations ( g - mode and p - mode oscillations ) and two types of resonances ( vertical and horizontal resonances ) . without considering all cases ,",
    "we consider here only a case where the time variations of qpos can be well explained .",
    "this is the case where disk oscillations are g - modes , and the resonances occur through vertical motions .",
    "details of the non - linear resonant oscillations on warped disks are presented by kato ( 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "an overview of the model is sketched in figure 1 of kato ( 2004a ) .",
    "we consider geometrically thin relativistic disks rotating with angular velocity , @xmath3 . the epicyclic frequency on the disk is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the oscillations on geometrically thin disks are classified into g - mode and p - mode oscillations ( see , e.g. , kato et al . 1998 ; kato 2001 ) .",
    "in simplified disks the oscillations are further sub - classified by the set ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7(0 , 1 , 2 ... ) is the number of nodes in the azimuthal direction , and @xmath8(0 , 1 , 2 ... ) is the number related to nodes in the vertical direction .",
    "that is , @xmath6 represents the number of nodes that @xmath9 ( the radial component of velocity associated with oscillations ) has in the vertical direction .",
    "it is noted , however , that @xmath10 ( the vertical component of velocity associated with oscillations ) has ( @xmath11 ) nodes in the vertical direction . in the case of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and",
    "a series of g - modes start from @xmath14 .",
    "a warp is generally a global pattern on disks with @xmath15 .",
    "the warp may have precession , but here we assume that it has no precession in order to consider idealized cases . on a disk deformed by the warp , we superpose g - mode oscillations with arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath6 is taken to be 1 or 2 , later ) .",
    "a g - mode oscillation with the frequency @xmath16 and ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) has a relatively large amplitude , global pattern only around the radius where @xmath17 is satisfied .",
    "this can be understood if the dispersion relation for local perturbations is considered .",
    "that is , the dispersion relation shows that the region of @xmath18 is an evanescent region of the g - mode oscillations . in the region where @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath20 , on the other hand , the oscillations have very short wavelengths in the radial direction when geometrically thin disks are considered .    a non - linear interaction of a g - mode oscillation with the warp produces an oscillation with @xmath16 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( these oscillations are called hereafter intermediate oscillations )",
    ". these intermediate oscillations resonantly interact with the disk at the radius where the dispersion relation for these intermediate oscillations is satisfied [ see kato ( 2004b ) for detailed discussions ] .",
    "there are two types of resonances , corresponding two types of wave modes .",
    "one is resonances that occur through motions in the vertical direction ( vertical resonances ) ; the other is those through motions in the radial direction ( horizontal resonances)(see , e.g. , kato 2004a , b ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested in vertical resonances .",
    "they occur around the radius where @xmath25 is satisfied ( see e.g. , kato 2004a , b , and the appendix in this paper ) , where @xmath26 is a number related to @xmath22 and @xmath27 ( a polytropic index specifying the vertical structure of disks , see the appendix ) .",
    "hereafter , we are particularly interested in cases where @xmath28 ( assuming @xmath14 ) and @xmath29 ( assuming @xmath30 ) . the quantities @xmath26 in these cases are",
    "@xmath31 as shown in the appendix . in the limit where the disk is isothermal in the vertical direction , @xmath32 and we have @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "they are cases that have been considered in previous papers ( kato 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) .    combining equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) , we find that the resonances occur at radii of @xmath35 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "after this resonance the intermediate oscillations feedback to the original oscillations by non - linear interaction with the original oscillations themselves .",
    "the results are amplification or dampening of the original oscillations , depending on the types of oscillations and resonances ( kato 2004b ) .",
    "detailed examination shows that when @xmath36 , the frequencies of the g - mode oscillations that resonantly interact with the disk at @xmath37 are @xmath38 at the radius . on the other hand , when @xmath39 the frequencies of the g - mode oscillations that resonantly interact with the disk at @xmath37 are @xmath40 there ( e.g. , kato 2004a ) .",
    "the most observable oscillations are those with small @xmath5 s ; otherwise , they are phase - mixed .",
    "hence , the frequencies , @xmath16 , of typical non - axisymmetric resonant oscillations are @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( i.e. , @xmath46 . as axisymmetric resonant oscillations we have @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "axisymmetric oscillations , however , will be less observable .",
    "hence , we think that the above non - axisymmetric oscillations are related to the horizontal branch qpos , upper and lower khz qpos . considering this ,",
    "we introduce @xmath49 and examine their frequencies at the resonance radius .",
    "in the limit of isothermal disks in the vertical direction , i.e. , @xmath32 , the resonance occurs at @xmath50 when @xmath28 and at @xmath51 when @xmath29 .",
    "these radii are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ( e.g. , kato 2004a ) .",
    "the temperature distribution in the vertical direction in disks is , however , generally not isothermal .",
    "furthermore , it changes with time , depending on the state of the disks . in figure 1 , the @xmath54@xmath55 relation given by @xmath56 is shown for the range of @xmath57@xmath58 . in the case of @xmath28 , @xmath55 ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) changes from 2 ( for @xmath60 or @xmath32 ) to 2.67 ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) , while @xmath63 changes from 3 ( @xmath60 ) to 5 ( for @xmath61 ) in the case of @xmath29 .",
    "the ranges of variations of @xmath59 and @xmath63 are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "if the value of @xmath55 is specified , the resonant radius is obtained .",
    "then , from equation ( [ 1.5 ] ) , the frequencies of the resonant oscillations , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are derived as functions of @xmath55 .",
    "the relations among these frequencies are shown in figure 2 as functions of @xmath64 .",
    "the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath64 is also shown .",
    "important points are that : i ) figure 2 is free from the mass of the central source , if the both horizontal and vertical scales are normalized by @xmath68 , and ii ) the curves in figure 2 are universal as long as g - mode oscillations are concerned .",
    "they are free from @xmath27 ( and @xmath55 ) , and even free from the presence or absence of precession ( see kato 2005 ) .",
    "that is , the frequencies of the resonant oscillations change along the curves when @xmath27 ( and thus @xmath55 ) is changed .",
    "the relation between @xmath64 and @xmath55 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "in general , an increase of @xmath55 decreases @xmath64 .",
    "the range of the variation of @xmath64 by a change of @xmath55 is also shown in figure 2 .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in figure 2 .",
    "the figure should be compared with figure 2.6 of van der klis ( 2004 ) , which summarizes observational data concerning qpo frequencies on a frequency  frequency diagram .",
    "this comparison suggests that the resonant oscillations specified by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 well correspond to the upper and lower khz qpos and the horizontal branch qpos in neutron - star lmxbs , respectively . adopting these identification",
    ", we qualitatively explain some basic observational characteristics of the qpos .",
    "the khz qpos in neutron - star lmxbs usually appear in a pair , and the separation frequency of the twin peaks decreases as the peak frequencies increase .",
    "this observational characteristic is derived in our model , as shown in figure 2 ( see the curves of @xmath65 and @xmath64 ) . in our model the frequency change of qpos is the result of a change of the temperature distribution in the vertical direction .",
    "as the temperature distribution in the vertical direction approaches to an isothermal one [ i.e. , @xmath59 ( the case of @xmath28 ) tends to 2.0 or @xmath63 ( the case of @xmath29 ) tends to 3.0 ] , the resonance radius becomes smaller ( see figure 1 ) and the frequencies of resonant oscillations increase .",
    "observations show that the frequencies of the pair qpos increase with an increase of the mass - accretion rate ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) . hence ,",
    "if our model is correct , it suggests that the temperature distribution in the vertical direction approaches to the isothermal one as the mass - accretion rate increases . here",
    ", let us make a quantitative estimate .",
    "figure 2 shows that the 3 : 2 ratio of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is realized when log@xmath69\\sim 2.93 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "this occurs for @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "this gives @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the resonance radius is then at @xmath74 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "one of another prominent correlations among qpo frequencies in neutron - star lmxbs is that the frequencies of the horizontal - branch qpos , @xmath1 , are correlated with the frequencies of lower khz qpos , @xmath0 , by @xmath75 . in order to compare our rersults with the observations ,",
    "the curve of the @xmath76@xmath64 relation is drawn in figure 2 .",
    "the curve crosses the curve labelled by @xmath66 around log@xmath69\\sim 2.46 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "figure 3 then shows @xmath78 , which means @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that the observed correlation can be explained if the temperature distribution in the vertical direction is , on average , around @xmath81 . from figure 1",
    "we see that the resonance occurs around @xmath82 when @xmath83 .",
    "as shown above , both @xmath64 : @xmath84 3 : 2 and @xmath85 can not be simultaneously satisfied in a rigorous sense .",
    "a slight larger coefficient than 0.08 , say 0.09 , is compatible with the ratio 3 : 2 .    in the case of black - hole lmxbs ,",
    "observations show that the frequencies of pair qpos change little , and their ratio is kept to be close to 3 : 2 , unlike the case of neutron - star khz qpos .",
    "as discussed in the case of neutron - star qpos , one possibility of explaining the observed 3 : 2 is that it represents @xmath64 : @xmath65 .",
    "another one , which is better , is to consider the resonances of @xmath28 and to regard the ratio as @xmath65 : @xmath67 . as discussed in kato ( 2004b ) ,",
    "if we consider the resonance at @xmath86 , @xmath64 is equal to @xmath65 and the ratio @xmath65(or @xmath64 ) : @xmath67 is just 3 : 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the resonance at @xmath86 is realized for @xmath28 when @xmath87 , which means @xmath88",
    "( i.e. , @xmath89 ) in the present model . figure 2 ( see also figure 3 ) shows that this occurs when log@xmath69=3.33 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "it is noted that in the case where the resonance occurs through intermediate oscillations of @xmath28 ( not @xmath29 ) , the frequency variation for a change of @xmath27 ( or @xmath91 ) is weak ( see the variation range of @xmath59 in figure 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath92 is compatible with observed results derived by mcclintock and remillard ( 2003 ) . it is , however , unclear why the balck - hole qpos are the resonances of @xmath28 @xmath93 , while the neutron - star qpos are the resonances of @xmath29 @xmath94 .",
    "more quantitative comparisons of our model with observations would be premature at the present stage , since the frequencies of vertical resonances are sensitive to the vertical structure of the disks ( the vertical structure is not always polytropic ) . in other words ,",
    "if our present model is correct , a comparison of our results with observations would give good information concerning the vertical structure of disks .",
    "the present resonance model naturally explains some basic characteristics of the khz qpos of neutron - star lmxbs and the high - frequency qpos of black - hole lmxbs .",
    "it is especially noted that the observed frequency change of khz qpos , which is observationally related to a change of the mass - accretion rate , is naturally explained if the vertical structure of disks changes with the change of the mass - accretion rate . in this sense",
    ", the present model seems to be superior to a precession model of warps ( kato 2005 ) . in the latter model ,",
    "a time variation of precession is required to explain the time variation of the observed khz qpo frequencies , and it is unclear whether such a variation of precession is generally expected theoretically . the latter model with precession , however , can naturally explain the observed hectohertz qpos as a manifestation of the precession of warps .",
    "in the present model of the vertical resonances , on the other hand , there is a problem concerning excitation .",
    "the vertical resonances do not excite the g - mode oscillations , but rather dampen them in the limit of @xmath32 ( kato 2004b ) .",
    "we should carefully study in the future whether our previous results concerning the stability of resonancs are correct and relevant , even when @xmath95 .",
    "comparisons of the characteristics of the present model with those of the precession model are given in table 1 .",
    "many qpo models have been proposed so far . some of them connect the observed qpo frequencies with the characteristic frequencies of disks , such as the orbital frequency , radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies and others , or their combinations .",
    "for example , in their precession model , stella and vietri ( 1998 ) identify the periastron precession frequency , @xmath41 [ see the third equation in ( [ 1.5 ] ) ] , with the lower frequency of the khz qpo . an important issue in such models",
    "is where preferred radii to produce specific frequencies exist . concerning this point , these models are classified into various types , e.g. , precession model ( stella , vietri 1998 ) , resonance model ( klu ' zniak , abramowicz 2001 ; abramowicz , klu ' zniak 2001 ) , and beat - frequency model ( miller et al .",
    "our warp model is based on hydrodynamical wave phenomena and different from the models mentioned above .",
    "however , if we discuss the present model in connection with them , a warp can be regarded as a process to select preferred radii .",
    "finally , the applicability of the present model to cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) is briefly discussed .",
    "mauche ( 2002 ) pointed out that the frequency correlation @xmath96 can be extended to cvs .",
    "this has recently been confirmed by warner and woudt ( 2004 ) .",
    "that is , the dno ( dwarf novae oscillation)qpo relation in cvs is on the line of extension of the hbo ",
    "khz qpo relation in x - ray stars .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the dnos in cvs change their frequencies , accompaning harmonics ( warner , woudt 2004 ) .",
    "the disks of cvs are keplerian and @xmath97 and @xmath47 are almost equal .",
    "hence , at a glance , the resonance conditions , i.e. , equations ( [ 1.4 ] ) , seem not to be realized anymore .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "the observations show that dnos usually occur in the phase of outbursts . near the transition front of outbursts ,",
    "the disk thickness changes sharply . in such region",
    ", the derivation of the resonance condition , @xmath98 , will be inaccurate , since the assumption of slow radial change of @xmath99 is involved in the derivation . if we assume , however , that the resonance condition , @xmath98 , is still valid , the resonances occur even in the newtonian kepler disks , if @xmath100 . since @xmath101 , @xmath102 is realized when @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "( as mentioned before , @xmath34 for @xmath60 and @xmath104 for @xmath61 . )",
    "a vertical disk structure with @xmath105 will not be unrealistic .",
    "this consideration suggests that the harmonic structure of dnos can be interpreted as the oscillations of @xmath106 , @xmath43 , and @xmath47 , at the resonant radius .",
    "their frequency ratios are 3 : 2 : 1 in the newtonian kepler disks . the observed frequency changes of dnos are interpreted as being the result of a change of the resonance radius by a change of the disk structure .",
    "[ see also kluniak et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for an interpretation of dnos . ]",
    "the observed correlation between dnos and qpos in cvs , however , can not be explained by the present model .",
    "further considerations are needed .",
    ".comparison of two resonant models of g - mode oscillations . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we employ cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) , whose origin is at the center of the central object and the @xmath109-axis is in the vertical direction perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "let us consider a disk where the pressure , @xmath110 , and density , @xmath111 , are related in the vertical direction with a polytropic relation , i.e. , @xmath112 , where @xmath27 is the polytropic index .",
    "then , the vertical integration of the hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction gives @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 where subscript 0 represents the quantities in the equilibrium state , and 00 represents those on the equatorial plane ( e.g. , kato et al .",
    "the half - thickness of the disk , @xmath116 , is related to @xmath117 and @xmath118 by @xmath119    we consider here a vertical oscillation of the disk , assuming , for simplicity , that it has no velocity in the horizontal direction .",
    "the perturbation associated with the oscillation is assumed to be proportional to exp[@xmath120 , where @xmath16 is the frequency of the oscillation and @xmath5 is the number of arms in the azimuthal direction .",
    "if the oscillation occurs under the polytropic relation given above , the vertical component of the equation of motion gives @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath10 and @xmath123 are the vertical velocity and the density perturbation associated with the oscillation , respectively , and @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
