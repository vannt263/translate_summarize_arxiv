    "high q cavities such as whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) cavities have recently demonstrated quality factors ( @xmath0 ) as high as @xmath3 and have shown the potential to reach even higher q values @xcite .",
    "however , there are difficulties in measurement of the linewidth and q of such high q cavities . while in theory",
    ", the q factor could be as high as @xmath4 and is limited only by rayleigh scattering @xcite , in practice , it is limited by other losses in the cavity .",
    "they include absorption and scattering losses due to impurities in the cavity material , and light - induced losses due to nonlinear processes .",
    "due to the extremely small mode volume and high q - factor of the cavity , the cavity build - up intensity is extremely high , even in the case of an input with small power ( as small as several mw ) .",
    "such a high resonator intensity leads to very efficient nonlinear processes inside wgm cavities , such as raman scattering , second harmonic generation , and four - wave mixing @xcite .",
    "whereas this is beneficial in many applications , it causes additional losses in the cavity and thus makes the q factor measurement unreliable ( at least , making it power - dependent ) @xcite .",
    "squeezed states of vacuum or light have been used in many applications such as improvement in interferometric @xcite and absorption @xcite measurements , for quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite , and for quantum imaging @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , no experiment for measurements of cavity parameters by use of squeezing has yet been reported . in this paper",
    "we propose and demonstrate an alternative method of measuring q factors by use of a squeezed vacuum field which is equivalent to a field with correlated quantum sidebands @xcite .",
    "this technique is advantageous over traditional optical methods in that it utilizes the injection of squeezed vacuum into a test cavity not to excite any nonlinear processes in the cavity .",
    "when the input field is detuned from the cavity resonance frequency , it transmits only the upper or lower quantum sidebands within the cavity linewidth while reflecting the counterparts ( associated upper or lower sidebands ) and all the other sidebands .",
    "the linewidth of the cavity can then be measured by observing the destruction of the correlation between the upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the carrier frequency .",
    "we show that the linewidth and q factor of a test cavity using the method agrees with those measured by traditional optical methods .",

    "hence , the cavity - coupled reflected field is composed of the uncorrelated sidebands within the linewidth and the reflected correlated sidebands outside of it .",
    "the consequence is the destruction of the correlation within the linewidth between the upper and lower quantum sidebands .",
    "this is analogous to the destruction of the correlation between electro - optically modulated coherent sidebands in pairs , in which the beat between the carrier and the upper or lower sideband can be measured only when either sideband is absorbed into the cavity , reflecting the carrier and other sideband .",

    "we also assume the input mirror is lossless such that @xmath90 .      since we are interested in having as little light ( at the carrier frequency ) as possible in the test cavity , it is instructive to calculate the average photon number in the field we use .",
    "the average photon number in squeezed light with squeeze factor @xmath91 and squeeze angle @xmath92 is given by @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the coherent amplitude of the light .",
    "as the number of coherent photons becomes zero ( @xmath95 ) , resulting in squeezed vacuum , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath96 this is the average photon number in squeezed vacuum generated by squeezing .",
    "note that if the field is unsqueezed ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 .",
    "for a squeeze factor of 1.5 corresponding to the squeezed or anti - squeezed level of @xmath99  db which is the current experimental limit @xcite , @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , it is fair to say that the optical influence of ideal squeezed vacuum on cavities is negligible .     and @xmath101 are shown as solid and dashed curves , respectively , for different input states .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) show the ( impure ) input state with @xmath102 db and @xmath103 db , _ in the absence of the cavity_. ( c ) and ( d ) show the cavity - coupled response to the squeezed and anti - squeezed vacuum injection , respectively .",

    "( d ) and ( f ) ] . ]",
    "similarly , it is instructive to compare this technique to using a classical state . for simplicity , assuming that the quadrature variance in both quadratures is frequency - independent , we consider the case in which the lower sideband is fully transmitted through an impedance - matched cavity and the upper sideband is fully reflected at the input mirror such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 at @xmath108 , respectively , which gives @xmath109 from eq .",
    "thus , the amplitude and phase quadrature variances of the reflected field are found to be @xmath110 in the absence of coherent light , the signal contrast can be defined as the quadrature variance at detuning frequency @xmath22 compared to the cavity - uncoupled quadrature variance at off - resonance frequencies ( @xmath111 ) , in which case @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the signal contrasts at the two orthogonal quadratures are respectively given by @xmath114 in the limiting case of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117    we see that @xmath118 has about the same limiting level as in the classical case , while @xmath119 grows if @xmath120 gets smaller .",
    "classically , @xmath121 ( the shot noise limit ) , but using squeezed vacuum we can obtain @xmath122 , or improved signal contrast for a measurement in the squeezed quadrature .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cl_vs_sq ] , where we compare the signal contrast for measurement of the cavity linewidth using a classical field with the signal contrast for squeezed field injection .",
    "the cavity - coupled responses of the classical and anti - squeezed quadrature variances behave almost identically in the case of the impedance - matched cavity , whereas squeezing improves the signal contrast of the measurement .",
    "it is important to note that even in the absence of technical noise , quadrature variance measurements are intrinsically contaminated by quantum noise itself .",
    "the standard deviation of the quadrature variances is given by  @xcite @xmath123 thus , the noise of the measurement is proportional to the measured value itself , and many averages can be performed to achieve smaller uncertainty levels .",
    "this is different from the classical case where the parameters of a cavity are measured by measuring the transmission of a probe optical field incident on the cavity as a function of cavity detuning . in this case",
    ", the measurements are fundamentally limited by shot noise : the number of measured photons ( n ) has uncertainty proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio grows as the number of the transmitted photons increases .",
    "mhz and @xmath125 mhz respectively .",
    "the squeezed vacuum generator is composed of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) and a second harmonic generator ( shg ) that pumps the opo .",
    "the cavity length is locked to the laser frequency by the pdh - locking servo and pzt ( pzt2 ) .",
    "the homodyne angle is locked by the noise - locking servo and pzt ( pzt1 ) . ]",
    "the experiment is schematically shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "the nd : yag laser ( lightwave model 126 ) gives an output of cw 700 mw at 1064 nm , which is injected into the squeezed vacuum generator ( squeezer ) .",
    "the squeezer is composed of a second harmonic generator ( shg ) and an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , both using 5@xmath126 mgo : linbo@xmath29 nonlinear crystals placed within optical cavities ( hemilith for the shg and monolith for the opo ) in the type i phase - matching configuration .",
    "the shg pumped by the nd : yag laser generates 250 mw at 532 nm , which then pumps the opo below threshold with a vacuum seed .",
    "the resultant field generated by the opo is a squeezed vacuum field with a squeezing bandwidth of 66.2 mhz defined by the opo cavity linewidth .",
    "a sub - carrier field , frequency - shifted by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to a frequency that is coincident with the cavity tem@xmath127 mode , is injected into the other end of the opo cavity . the cavity is thus locked to the tem@xmath127 mode , offset by 220 mhz from the carrier frequency , using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking technique @xcite .",
    "the frequency - shift is necessary to ensure that no cavity transmitted light at the fundamental frequency is injected into the opo cavity since it acts as a seed and degrades broadband squeezing due to the imperfect isolation of the faraday isolator @xcite .",
    "this is especially important for high q cavities with linewidths as narrow as khz because low - frequency squeezing is difficult to achieve .",
    "the squeezed vacuum is injected into a triangular test cavity with the fsr of 713 mhz and fwhm of @xmath2 khz , both measured by traditional methods using light .",
    "the frequency shift , of the subcarrier is @xmath128 mhz so that the carrier frequency is detuned from the tem@xmath129 mode by @xmath130 mhz . as a result of this frequency shift ,",
    "only the upper sidebands are within the cavity linewidth , destroying the correlation between the upper and lower sidebands and , therefore , destroying the squeezing or anti - squeezing .",
    "this cavity - coupled squeezed vacuum reflection is measured by balanced homodyne detection , where the field to be measured interferes with a local oscillator ( lo ) field and is detected by two ( nearly ) identical photodetectors .",
    "the difference of the two photodetector signals is sent to an hp4195a spectrum analyzer ( sa ) to measure the noise variance of the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] .",
    "the experimental data are exponentially averaged 100 times .",
    "the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer is 100 khz .",
    "since the squeezed vacuum does not carry any coherent amplitude , the noise - locking technique @xcite is employed to lock the homodyne angle to either the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature at 2 mhz .",
    "khz . ]    before fitting the experimental data points , the homodyne efficiencies @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and the quantum efficiency of the photo - detectors @xmath133 need to be taken into account . the sum of the homodyne efficiencies and the quantum efficiency were independently measured to be @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively . the sum of the efficiencies @xmath136 in eq . is given by @xmath137 .",
    "we ignore @xmath132 since the cavity mode - matching efficiency is @xmath138 and hence @xmath139 , which yields @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that the input mirror m@xmath141 is lossless .",
    "this assumption is valid since it is a single - pass loss and does not influence the linewidth of the cavity .",
    "we then fit eq . to the measured data points with free parameters @xmath88,@xmath142 , and @xmath22 ; both the data and the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] .",
    "the resulting fitting values are @xmath143 , and @xmath144 mhz .",
    "therefore , the fwhm linewidth of the cavity is found to be @xmath145 khz , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( @xmath2 khz ) .",
    "we note that @xmath38 can be determined from the fit , but here we have used the optically measured value to estimate the linewidth .",
    "this is valid because any loss in the cavity does not change the fsr .",
    "we have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method for non - invasive measurements of optical cavity parameters by use of squeezed vacuum .",
    "the technique has the advantage over traditional optical methods that the injection of a squeezed vacuum field as a probe for cavity parameters does not excite any nonlinear processes in cavities , and is , therefore , useful for ultrahigh q cavities such as whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) cavities .",
    "we have shown that when a squeezed vacuum field is injected into a detuned cavity , the linewidth and @xmath0 factor of a test cavity can be determined by measuring the destruction of upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the carrier frequency .",
    "the linewidth of a test cavity is measured to be @xmath146 khz , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( @xmath147 khz ) .",
    "we have also show that the use of squeezed fields leads to better signal contrast , as expected .",
