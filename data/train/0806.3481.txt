    "our reformulation works over a general field ( not of characteristic two ) , in arbitrary dimensions , and even with an arbitrary quadratic form ",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "euclid and other ancient greeks regarded _ area _ , not _ distance _ , as the fundamental quantity in planar geometry .",
    "indeed they worked with a straightedge and compass in their constructions , not a ruler and protractor .",
    "a line segment was measured by constructing a square on it , and determining the area of that square .",
    "two line segments were considered equal if they were _ congruent _ , but this was independent of a direct notion of distance measurement .",
    "area is an _ affine concept _ :",
    "more precisely _ proportions _ between areas are maintained by linear transformations . even with a different metrical geometry , for example a relativistic geometry in which @xmath9 plays the role of @xmath10 , the notion of signed area defined by a determinant applies .",
    "in other words , in planar geometry area is a basic notion and may be considered prior to any theory of linear measurement .    to euclid ,",
    "pythagoras theorem is a relation about the areas of squares built on each of the sides of a right triangle .",
    "this insight has largely been lost in the modern formulation , but with a sheet of graph paper it is still an attractive way to introduce students to the subject , as the area of many simple figures can be computed by subdividing , translating and counting cells .",
    "[ h ]    pyth4,2bw.eps    the squares on the sides of triangle @xmath0 shown in figure [ pythagoras theorem ] have areas @xmath11 and @xmath12 the largest square for example can be seen as four triangles which can be rearranged to get two @xmath13 rectangles , together with a @xmath14 square , for a total area of @xmath12 so from this point of view pythagoras theorem is a result which can be established by _ counting _ , and the use of irrational numbers to describe lengths is not necessary .",
    "this applies to any right triangle with rational coordinates .    following the greek terminology of ` quadrature '",

    "clearly the irrational number @xmath24 is a far more sophisticated and complicated object than the natural number @xmath25    in statistics , variance is more natural than standard deviation . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "wave functions are more basic than probability amplitudes . in harmonic analysis , @xmath26 is more pleasant than @xmath27 in geometry , _ quadrance is more fundamental than distance_.    for a triangle @xmath0 we define the quadrances @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . here then is _ _",

    "let s now give another form of heron s formula , with a new name .",
    "arab sources suggest that archimedes knew heron s formula earlier , and the greatest mathematician of all time deserves credit for more than he currently gets .    [ archimedes]the area of a triangle @xmath0 with quadrances @xmath58 and @xmath59 is given by@xmath60    in our example the triangle has quadrances @xmath61 and @xmath62 each obtained by pythagoras theorem .",
    "so archimedes theorem states that@xmath63 and this gives an area of @xmath38 in rational trigonometry , the quantity @xmath64 is the * quadrea * of the triangle , and turns out to be the single most important number associated to a triangle .",

    "it is instructive to see how to go from heron s formula to archimedes theorem . in terms of the side lengths @xmath66 and @xmath50:@xmath67    archimedes theorem implies another formula of considerable importance .",
    "[ triple quad formula]the three points @xmath68 and @xmath5 are collinear precisely when@xmath69    the proof is of course immediate , as collinearity is equivalent to the area of the triangle being zero .",

    "vagueness about angles , and the accompanying ambiguities in the definition of the circular functions @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 weaken most calculus texts .",
    "there is a reason that classical trigonometry is painful to students  it is _ based on the wrong notions_. as a result , mathematics teachers are forced to continually rely on @xmath73 and @xmath74 triangles for examples and test questions , which makes the subject very narrow and repetitive .",

    "we want to show that the basic results of this new theory _",
    "follow naturally from the above presentation of pythagoras theorem , the triangle area theorem , and archimedes theorem_.    the key innovation is to replace angle with a completely algebraic concept .",
    "the separation between lines @xmath75 and @xmath76 is captured rather by the notion of _ spread _ , which may be defined as the ratio of two quadrances as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath75 and @xmath76 intersect at the point @xmath77 choose a point @xmath78 on one of the lines , say @xmath79 and let @xmath80 be the foot of the perpendicular from @xmath81 to @xmath76 .    [ h ]    spreaddef.eps    then the * spread * @xmath82 between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is @xmath83 this ratio is independent of the choice of @xmath84 according to thales , and is defined _ between lines , not rays_. parallel lines are defined to have spread @xmath85 while perpendicular lines have spread @xmath86    the spread between the lines @xmath75 and @xmath76 with equations @xmath87 and @xmath88 turns out to be@xmath89 since this is a rational expression , spread becomes a useful concept also over general fields , although in this paper we stick to the usual situation over the decimal numbers .",

    "the _ triple quad formula _ , _",
    "pythagoras theorem _ , the _ spread law _",
    ", the _ cross law _ and the _ triple spread formula _ are the five main laws of rational trigonometry .",
    "we now see these are closely linked to the geometrical work of the ancient greeks .",
    "as demonstrated at some length in @xcite , these formulas and a few additional ones suffice to solve the majority of trigonometric problems , usually more simply , more accurately and more elegantly than the classical theory involving transcendental circular functions and their inverses .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , the same formulas extend to geometry over arbitrary fields ( not of characteristic two ) and with general quadratic forms .",
    "in retrospect , the blind spot first occurred with the pythagoreans , who initially believed that all of nature should be expressible in terms of natural numbers and their proportions .",
    "when they discovered that the ratio of the length of a diagonal to the length of a side of a square was the incommensurable proportion @xmath119 legend has it that they tossed the exposer of the secret overboard while at sea .",
    "had they maintained their beliefs in the workings of the divine mind , and stuck with the _ squares of the lengths as the crucial quantities in geometry , _ then mathematics would have had a significantly different history , einstein s special theory of relativity would possibly have been discovered earlier , algebraic geometry would have quite another aspect , and students would today be studying a simpler and more elegant trigonometry  much more happily !"
