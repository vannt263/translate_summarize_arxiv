    "in high energy hadronic collisions , baryons are produced both in the central and in the forward rapidity region . in the first case",
    "baryons are produced together with antibaryons and the net baryon number ( baryons minus antibaryons ) is small . in contrast , in the large rapidity region there are almost only baryons and no antibaryons .",
    "these experimental facts suggest that the forward baryons are produced from the valence quarks of the projectile , whereas low rapidity baryons are produced mainly from gluons and sea quarks .",
    "how valence quarks are converted into forward ( or leading ) baryons remains to be clarified . in lower ( @xmath1 gev ) energies",
    "proton - proton collisions , leading baryon production can be well understood in terms of recombination of the three valence quarks after the collision with the target @xcite or , equally well , in terms of diquark fragmentation @xcite . at higher energies",
    "new phenomena are expected to affect forward baryon production . at high energies and at large rapidities , baryon production requires the interaction of valence quark with a relatively large momentum fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the projectile with low fractional momentum ( small @xmath3 ) partons in the target . in the low @xmath4 regime",
    "the target is a dense system of partons ( predominantly gluons ) which may form the color glass condensate ( cgc ) , a state of very high partonic densities in which the nonlinear effects of qcd change the parton distributions and hence the cross sections ( for reviews see ref .",
    "the cgc is characterized by a momentum scale which marks the onset of nonlinear ( or saturation ) effects .",
    "this so called saturation scale , @xmath5 , grows with the reaction energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was conjectured that at increasing projectile energies the valence quarks receive a transverse momentum kick of the order of @xmath5 and hence above a certain energy the coherence of the projectile quarks is lost and the leading baryon production mechanism changes from recombination to independent fragmentation . in this work",
    "we shall explore the phenomenological implications of this assumption for the leading baryon production in @xmath0 collisions at lhc energies .",
    "our goal is to improve the previous studies using the cgc formalism that have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the nonlinear evolution of the target was accounted for . in particular , we would like to improve the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite by computing the @xmath6 distribution of the produced leading baryons , which was missing in that work .",
    "furthermore we also improve the treatment of the nonlinear effects , considering the forward dipole scattering amplitude proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which capture the main properties of the solution of the bk equation , which determines the qcd evolution of the cgc , and describes the rhic and lhc data for hadron production .",
    "we also extend these previous studies @xcite to @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions and estimate for the first time the ratio @xmath9 for leading baryon production .",
    "finally , the proton and pion productions at forward rapidities are compared .",
    "our study is strongly motivated by the recent results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has demonstrated that the lhcf experimental data @xcite for the neutral pion production at very low-@xmath6 can be quite well described considering the cgc formalism , indicating the emergence of saturation scale as a hard momentum scale at very forward rapidities which allows to understand highly nonperturbative phenomena in qcd by using weak coupling methods .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the cgc formalism and its main formulas .",
    "in particular we present the models for the forward dipole scattering amplitude used in our calculations . in section [ section : results ] we present our results for the @xmath6 and @xmath10 dependences of the leading baryon cross section",
    ". a comparison with the rhic data is performed and predictions for baryon production in @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions at lhc energies are presented .",
    "moreover , we present our predictions for the ratio @xmath13",
    ". finally , in section [ section : sum ] , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in the cgc formalism the differential cross section for the forward production of a hadron of transverse momentum @xmath6 at rapidity @xmath10 reads @xcite @xmath14 where the net - baryon fragmentation function is defined as : @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the fraction of the energy of the fragmenting quark ( @xmath17 ) taken by the emerging baryon @xmath18 .",
    "the fractional momenta of the projectile quark and of the target gluon are @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath21 is the quark transverse momentum and the feynman @xmath4 variable is given by @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 is the valence quark distribution of the projectile hadron and the function @xmath24 is the unintegrated gluon distribution of the hadron target which is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a bessel function and @xmath27 is the forward scattering amplitude of a color dipole of radius @xmath28 off a hadron target .",
    "the evolution of @xmath27 is described in the mean field approximation of the cgc formalism @xcite by the bk equation @xcite .",
    "this quantity encodes the information about the hadronic scattering and then about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) . in the last years",
    ", several groups have constructed phenomenological models which satisfy the asymptotic behaviours of the leading order bk equation in order to fit the hera and rhic data @xcite . in general , it is assumed that it can be modelled through a simple glauber - like formula , which reads @xmath29 \\,\\ , , \\label{ngeral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the anomalous dimension of the target gluon distribution .",
    "the main difference among the distinct phenomenological models comes from the behaviour predicted for the anomalous dimension , which determines the transition from the nonlinear to the extended geometric scaling regime , as well as from the extended geometric scaling to the dglap regime . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analyses to the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the so called buw model , which is able to describe the @xmath31 hera data for the proton structure function and the hadron spectra measured in @xmath7 and @xmath32 collisions at rhic energies @xcite . another feature of the buw model which motivates this analysis is that it explicitly satisfies the property of geometric scaling @xcite , which is predicted for the solutions of the bk equation in the asymptotic regime of large energies . in the buw model ,",
    "the anomalous dimension is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xcite @xmath35 in the expression above , @xmath36 and the two free parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fitted in such a way to describe the rhic data on hadron production .",
    "it is clear , from eq.([buweq ] ) , that this model satisfies the property of geometric scaling @xcite , since @xmath39 depends on @xmath4 and @xmath28 only through the variable @xmath40 . besides ,",
    "in comparison with other phenomenological parametrizations , in the buw model , the behaviour expected for the unintegrated gluon distribution in the large @xmath6 limit ( linear regime ) is recovered : @xmath41 at large @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , in ref . @xcite the nonlinear effects were taken into account considering the model proposed long ago by golec - biernat and wusthoff @xcite , where the forward dipole scattering amplitude is given by eq .",
    "( [ ngeral ] ) with @xmath43 .",
    "this model implies that the @xmath28 integration in eq .",
    "( [ ugd ] ) can be carried out analytically and a simple expression for the unintegrated gluon distribution can be obtained : @xmath44 although this model satisfactorily describes the nonlinear regime ( small - @xmath42 ) , it clearly does not contain the expected behaviour for large-@xmath42 . consequently , the resulting predictions are not valid at large values of the transverse momentum of the hadron .",
    "this explains the behaviour observed in figs . 3 and 4 of the ref .",
    "@xcite for the net - proton spectra .",
    "lets initially compare our predictions with the results previously presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig . [ fig:1 ]",
    "we present our results for the net - baryon rapidity distributions for @xmath12 collisions at sps with energy @xmath45 gev and also for @xmath46 collisions at rhic ( @xmath47 and 200 gev ) .",
    "the net - baryon rapidity distribution is obtained integrating eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) in @xmath6 between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath50 comes from the kinematical condition @xmath51 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the nuclear valence quark distribution is given by @xmath52 , with @xmath53 being the number of participants . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the curve denoted mt represents the predictions originally derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the unintegrated gluon distribution is given by the gbw model [ eq .",
    "( [ ugd.anal ] ) ] , the proton valence quark distribution is described by the mrst01-lo parametrization @xcite and the fragmentation function is given by the following phenomenological model : @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "as already demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , this model describes quite well the experimental data for the net - baryon rapidity distribution for @xmath58 and 62.4 gev , but overestimates the data for @xmath59 gev and forward rapidities . the gbw curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] represents the predictions resulting from the substitution of the phenomenological model for the fragmentation function by the kkp parametrization @xcite .",
    "we observe that the inclusion of a realistic model for fragmentation functions implies that the data at forward rapidities and very low energies are not well represented anymore .",
    "in contrast , at larger energies the mt and gbw predictions are similar .",
    "finally , the buw curves show the predictions obtained considering the unintegrated gluon distribution derived from the buw model for the forward dipole scattering amplitude . as in the gbw prediction",
    ", we also use the mrst01-lo and kkp parametrizations for the proton valence quark distribution and fragmentation functions , respectively .",
    "the buw results improve the description of the data for @xmath59 gev and forward rapidities but fail to describe the data at smaller energies , which can indicate the limitation of this approach at lower energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we present the buw predictions for the net - baryon rapidity distributions in central @xmath12 collisions at lhc energies . for comparison we also present the mt and gbw predictions .",
    "we observe that the three predictions are similar . for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present our predictions for @xmath11 collisions at lhc energies .            in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we present our predictions for the net - baryon transverse momentum spectra in central @xmath46 collisions at rhic energies . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we have assumed @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 gev , respectively .",
    "these plots show two striking features .",
    "first , we observe a very good agreement between data and the spectra obtained with eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) and the buw dipole amplitude and , at the same time , a disagreement between data points and the spectra obtained with the gbw dipole amplitude , specially when @xmath64 gev .",
    "this happens because the gbw dipole amplitude has no dglap evolution and should not be able to reproduce data with large @xmath6 .",
    "the buw amplitude has the correct behaviour at larger @xmath6 and is able to describe the data in this region .",
    "another interesting feature of these plots is the failure of the formalism at the largest rapidity and lowest energy .",
    "this may be an indication that here the baryons are not produced by independent quark fragmentation .",
    "they are more likely to be produced by coalescence of the incoming valence quarks . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we present our predictions for the proton and pion transverse momentum spectra at @xmath65 gev and different rapidities .",
    "as already verified for rhic energies , the gbw and buw predictions are very distinct at large transverse momentum , in particular at @xmath66 . at larger values of rapidities ,",
    "both predictions are similar , which is directly associated to the limitation in the phase space available for the considered energy .",
    "moreover , it is important to emphasize the similarity between the @xmath6 behaviour of proton and pion production .             in order to quantify the magnitude of the nuclear effects in the net - proton production we introduce the nuclear modification ratio , equal to the ratio of the net - proton production cross section in @xmath8 collisions over the one in @xmath7 collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions and defined by @xmath67 the behaviour of this ratio for valence quark production ,",
    "i.e. not including quark fragmentation , has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the quasi - classical approximation of the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite taking into account quantum corrections through the nonlinear evolution derived in ref .",
    "the authors predict the presence of a cronin enhancement in the quasi - classical regime and a suppression in the nuclear modification factor when the nonlinear effects are considered .",
    "in contrast to the approach discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focus on the production of soft valence quarks far away ( in rapidity ) from the fragmentation region , here we consider the production of hard valence quarks which experience no recoil and are produced in the fragmentation region as proposed in ref . @xcite . as already emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , both approaches are complementary .",
    "however , the behaviour of @xmath13 in the latter approach is still an open issue . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] we present our predictions .",
    "we observe a suppression at small values of @xmath6 which increases at larger energies and rapidities , as expected from nonlinear effects .",
    "the cgc formalism of forward particle production is appropriate to study the difference between the net - proton and net - pion production at forward rapidities . in what follows we analyse the behaviour of the ratio between the cross sections for net - proton and net - pion production in @xmath12 collisions . until some years ago the proton to pion ratio was expected to be always smaller than one .",
    "however , in some experiments @xcite , this ratio was found to be much larger and in the range @xmath68 gev , being even compatible with one .",
    "this has been called `` the baryon anomaly '' . some explanations for this effect",
    "have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the interest in the subject will grow again now in view of the appearance of very recent data from alice @xcite , which confirm the observation of the anomaly in @xmath11 collisions . in fig.[fig:7 ] we show the proton - to - pion ratio as a function of the transverse momentum considering the cgc formalism .",
    "as it can be seen , the @xmath69 ratio is small , depends very weakly on the rapidity , on the collision energy and decreases with @xmath6 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with experimental data @xcite , which show a ratio @xmath69 increasing with the transverse momentum and reaching large values , close to @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that in the cgc formalism there is no baryon anomaly and pions are always more abundant .",
    "therefore the anomaly must come from the protons and pions produced from gluons and sea quarks in the central rapidity region .",
    "forward nucleon production is very important for cosmic ray physics , where highly energetic protons reach the top of the atmosphere and undergo successive high energy scatterings on the light nuclei in the air . in each of these collisions , a projectile proton ( the leading baryon )",
    "looses energy , creating showers of particles , and goes to the next scattering .",
    "the interpretation of cosmic data depends on the accurate knowledge of the leading baryon momentum spectrum and its energy dependence .",
    "the crucial question of practical importance is the existence or non - existence of the feynman scaling , which says that @xmath71-spectra of secondaries are energy independent . in cosmic ray applications we are sensitive essentially to the large @xmath71 region ( the fragmentation region ) and",
    "hence we can try to answer this question using the cgc formalism and the expressions derived in the preceding sections .",
    "an additional motivation for this calculation is the fact that , in the near future , feynman scaling ( or its violation ) will be investigated experimentally at the lhc by the lhcf collaboration @xcite .",
    "changing variables from @xmath10 to @xmath71 and integrating ( [ dist ] ) over @xmath6 we obtain the @xmath71 spectra of leading protons and pions in @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions at several energies , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] . in all panels we can clearly see a shift to smaller values of @xmath71 ,",
    "indicating a softening of the leading particle spectrum .",
    "this feynman scaling violation is compatible with the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , where different mechanisms are responsible for the violating behaviour .",
    "in this work we have improved the cgc formalism of forward particle production developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and applied it to the study of rapidity distributions , @xmath6 and @xmath71 spectra of forward protons and pions .",
    "we obtain a good agreement with existing data and show predictions for the forthcoming lhc data .",
    "concerning forward proton production , our results suggest that at energies around @xmath72 gev there is a transition from quark recombination to independent quark fragmentation .",
    "this is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , where the independent fragmentation dynamics underpredicts the data at large rapidities and lower energies but starts to describe the data very well at higher energies .",
    "the same effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] at the largest rapidities . a solid conclusion about this change of mechanism still requires further theoretical and experimental work .",
    "we observe a violation of feynman scaling in leading particle spectra which is compatible with other approaches .",
    "finally , in the cgc formalism we do not observe any baryon anomaly .",
    "this suggests that this phenomenon is related to the central region dynamics of gluons and sea quarks .",
