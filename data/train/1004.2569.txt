    "anomalous behaviors of high-@xmath0 cuprates observed in the normal metallic state above @xmath0 hold the key not only to understanding the mechanism of the superconductivity but also to a possible manifestation of an unexplored metallic phase distinguished from the fermi liquid.@xcite extraordinary electronic structure is induced by a small density of carrier doping into the mott insulator .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopies ( arpes ) have in fact revealed detailed anomalies of the normal - state spectra , such as momentum - dependent excitation gap ( pseudogap ) , a truncated fermi surface ( fermi arc ) , and kinks in the dispersion.@xcite    toward the understanding of the anomalous metals , especially the pseudogap formation , many theoretical proposals have been made so far.@xcite the proposals include a cooper paring without phase coherence,@xcite and hidden orders or its fluctuations competing with the superconductivity , such as antiferromagnetism,@xcite charge or stripe orderings,@xcite and @xmath1-density wave.@xcite mechanisms attributing the origin of the pseudogap to a direct consequence of the proximity to the mott insulator have also been proposed.@xcite    among the theoretical efforts , recent development of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and its cluster extensions @xcite has enabled studies on dynamics of microscopic models without any _ ad hoc _ approximation . in particular , studies on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model using the cluster dmft ( cdmft ) have offered many useful insights into the electronic structure of cuprates , by identifying the pseudogap , fermi arc,@xcite and high - energy kink @xcite in the calculated spectra .",
    "the cdmft is specifically suited and powerful for this problem because of its nonperturbative framework , namely , it is based on neither weak nor strong coupling expansions .",
    "furthermore , it takes account of short - range spatial correlations within a cluster explicitly .",
    "these are big advantages in exploring momentum - resolved dynamics in the intermediate coupling region , which is relevant to physics of the cuprates .",
    "in particular , recent cdmft studies on doped mott insulators have revealed emergence of non - fermi - liquid phases , characterized by unexpected coexistence of two singularities at the fermi level , one characteristic to the weak - coupling and the other to the strong - coupling regions.@xcite    the singularity characterizing weakly interacting metals , namely , fermi liquids , is a pole of the single - particle green s function @xmath2 .",
    "energy dependence of its locus in the momentum space determines band dispersions , particularly , the fermi surface at the fermi level . on the other hand ,",
    "a crucial singularity in the strong coupling region is a zero of @xmath2 .",
    "the situations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zero ] , which schematically shows how the real part of @xmath2 changes the sign in the energy - momentum space . because re@xmath2 must be positive at high energy while negative at low energy , it has to change its sign at least once between these two regions .",
    "the sign change also has to take place in the brillouin zone at the fermi level , say , between the zone center and the zone boundary , if the dispersion far from the fermi level ensures positive re@xmath2 in some part of momenta and negative re@xmath2 in the other part . in the normal metals ,",
    "the sign change occurs at the poles of @xmath2 ( i.e. , the band dispersions ) , where re@xmath2 goes to @xmath3 on the lower side of the band and comes back from @xmath4 on the upper side [ fig .",
    "[ fig : zero](a ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "what happens when correlation effects induce a gap in the band at the fermi level ?",
    "because of the absence of poles inside the gap by definition , there is no way for re@xmath2 to change its sign at the fermi level except for getting through zeros [ fig .",
    "[ fig : zero](b)].@xcite re@xmath5 means the divergence of the self - energy , so that a zero of @xmath2 is a singular point of the self - energy .",
    "the non - fermi liquids discovered in cdmft show a coexistence of these two characteristics  poles and zeros of @xmath2 at the fermi level.@xcite in a lightly hole - doped region , the poles form a hole - pocket fermi surface around the nodal direction [ from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , while the zeros form a surface enclosing @xmath8 .",
    "it has been suggested that the fermi arc emerges because of such peculiar electronic structure : the pocket loses the spectral intensity on the side closer to the zero surface , leaving the other side as an arc.@xcite similar mechanisms were proposed , based on an assumed functional form of green s functions @xcite or a weakly - coupled chain model.@xcite the pseudogap is also characterized by the same zero surface crossing the fermi level . in the previous paper @xcite we clarified the structure of poles and zeros in the whole energy - momentum space for hole - doped and undoped mott insulators .",
    "we thus proposed a unified picture for understanding various puzzling features of mott physics in the light of reconstructions of pole - zero structure under progressive doping from the mott insulator to the fermi liquid in the overdoped region .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show how and to what extent we can understand experimental findings within the ` pole - zero mechanism ' .",
    "we implement cdmft calculations at zero and finite temperatures , clarifying the relationship between zero - temperature pole - zero structure and the spectra observed in experiments at finite temperatures .",
    "we find that a number of non - fermi - liquid aspects , i.e. , spectral asymmetry as to the fermi level , back - bending or incoherent feature of the dispersion , high- and low - energy kinks , and fermi arc or pockets in the hole- and electron - doped cuprates , are comprehensively understood within the pole - zero mechanism .",
    "in addition to a coherent picture for various experiments , our numerical results predict a distinctive feature of the pseudogap : the numerical data support a fully opened gap above the fermi level even in the nodal direction , which is incompatible with scenarios on the basis of the @xmath1-wave gap in the zero - temperature limit .",

    "we adopt @xmath31 or @xmath32 , which are realistic values for the cuprates and indeed reproduce the mott insulating state for undoped case .    in the cdmft",
    "@xcite we map the system ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) onto a model consisting of an @xmath33-site cluster c and bath degrees of freedom b. the bath is determined in a self - consistent way to provide an @xmath34 dynamical mean - field matrix @xmath35 at temperature @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "after the self - consistency loop converges , we calculate a quantity @xmath38 defined on the original lattice from those on the cluster , @xmath39.@xcite this periodization procedure is based on the fourier transformation truncated by the cluster size @xmath33 , @xmath40_{ij}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_{ij } } , \\label{eq : periodize}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is defined on the entire brillouin zone of the original lattice and @xmath42 is the real - space vector connecting two cluster sites @xmath16 and @xmath43 .",
    "the truncation by a small @xmath33 gives a good approximation to the thermodynamic limit of @xmath44 if @xmath39 is well localized within the cluster .",
    "in reality it is difficult to find a quantity which is short ranged in the entire parameter range of the interaction strength and the doping concentration .",
    "therefore we need to choose an appropriate quantity to periodize , according to situations .",
    "for example , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 : self - energy ) is a good choice for weakly interacting normal metals,@xcite but it becomes highly nonlocal and long ranged in the strong coupling region ( e.g. , in the mott insulator ) .",
    "this is due to an appearance of zeros of @xmath2 , i.e. , poles of @xmath46 in the momentum space ( see appendix a for further detail ) . on the other hand , in the mott insulator",
    "@xmath47 is more appropriate because it is nearly local in the strong coupling regime.@xcite    another choice for the periodization is the cumulant @xmath48^{-1}.\\ ] ] it was pointed out that the cumulant periodization works well in a wide range of @xmath18 including the strong coupling , because it is similar in the functional form to the atomic green function.@xcite moreover , the periodization by the cumulant has an important feature , i.e. , it can describe both poles and zeros of @xmath2 at the same time , while the periodization by using @xmath46 ( @xmath2 ) describes only poles ( zeros ) .",
    "this opens up the intriguing possibility of exploring the coexistence of poles and zeros at the fermi level , as substantiation of anomalous metals .    in the present study",

    "we numerically solve the effective cluster problem by means of the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method at @xmath61 and the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) method at @xmath62 , as we elaborate below .",
    "we hereafter omit the superscript l in @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "although the pseudogap state in cuprates is experimentally detectable only above @xmath0 , it is still significant to elucidate the nature of the pseudogap state in the zero temperature limit , by assuming the paramagnetic metal for the doped mott insulator .",
    "this is a circumstance similar to the normal metal , where the concept of the fermi liquid justified only in the zero temperature limit in the strict sense has proven to be fruitful . for this purpose of clarifying the zero temperature limit",
    ", we employ the lanczos ed method @xcite for the cluster problem .    in this scheme",
    "we take a large but finite value of pseudo inverse temperature @xmath63 ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 throughout the paper ) , which practically represents the ground state with an energy resolution corresponding to @xmath66 .",
    "we then represent the dynamical mean field @xmath67 with a finite number @xmath68 of bath degrees of freedom , which constitute together with c sites the effective hamiltonian to be diagonalized .",
    "we take @xmath69 throughout the paper .",
    "the optimization of b sites is done by minimizing the distance function defined by @xmath70_{ij }       -\\left[\\hat{g}_{0,n_{\\text{b}}}(i\\w_n)\\right]_{ij}\\right|^2        e^{-\\w_n / t } , \\label{eq : distance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the non - interacting green s function for the effective hamiltonian and we have introduced the exponential weight factor @xmath72 with @xmath73 to reproduce more precisely the important low - frequency part . we have examined several other types of distance functions and confirmed that qualitative feature of the results obtained in this paper does not depend on the choice .",
    "an advantage of the lanczos method is that green s function is obtained as a function of real frequency @xmath74 by the continued - fraction expansion , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the ground - state vector and the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the elements of the tridiagonal matrix appearing in the lanczos algorithm.@xcite we take account of up to 2000th order in the expansion .",

    "this is based on the observation that @xmath79 does not substantially change the location of poles and zeros of @xmath2 but changes only the sharpness of these singularities.@xcite indeed , as long as @xmath79 is sufficiently smaller than the typical energy scale of the system , the location of the poles and zeros is virtually determined only by @xmath77 and @xmath78 in eq .",

    "thus , @xmath79 provides an opportunity to get insight into how the electronic structure at finite temperatures evolves from the pole - zero structure at zero temperature .",
    "the effect of @xmath79 is confirmed by a direct comparison with the finite - temperature results obtained by qmc introduced below .",
    "note that this smearing technique by @xmath79 is very useful because it is difficult for qmc to obtain the precise electronic structure at real frequencies because it requires an analytic continuation of the numerical data .",

    "this decomposes the many - body partition function into a sum of single - particle systems , which we collect .",
    "while the algorithm is based on the series expansion up to infinite order , it is feasible to obtain a numerically exact result because , after numerical convergence , all the orders in the expansion are virtually taken into account.@xcite    we implement the ctqmc sampling for the auxiliary fields , employing the updating algorithm proposed in ref .  .",
    "we typically take @xmath80 steps for each qmc simulation , and after convergence in the self - consistency loop , we average over 30 data starting from @xmath81 s which are different within a statistical error bar .",

    "we define the @xmath41-dependent amplitude @xmath83 of the pseudogap as the energy difference between the upper and the lower poles at each @xmath41 .",

    "[ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "our results suggest that the  @xmath1-wave structure \" is an artifact of the symmetrizing analysis , and in reality , the pseudogap has a non-@xmath1-wave ( namely , full - gap ) structure . in appendix c",
    "we confirm that the gap in the nodal direction persists for a larger cluster , by implementing an @xmath90 cdmft+ctqmc calculation at a low temperature .",
    "it is interesting to examine this interpretation experimentally .",
    "our theory predicts that a gap exists above @xmath88 even in the nodal direction if the paramagnetic metal persists down to zero temperature .",
    "this means that the symmetrization @xcite used in arpes breaks down in the pseudogap state due to the spectral asymmetry as to the fermi energy .",
    "this may be examined by spectroscopic or scattering probes to observe unoccupied electronic states above the fermi level , such as the inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( ipes ) .",

    "this unusual structure comes out thanks to the use of the cumulant periodization ( see sec .",

    "the second peak is , however , not visible for @xmath113 and only the broadened main peak can be seen there .",

    "recent experimental observation @xcite of the shubnikov - de haas oscillation in nd@xmath28ce@xmath29cuo@xmath25 also indicates a presence of the hole pocket around optimal doping .",
    "therefore , to confirm the above scenario with a larger cluster calculation incorporating @xmath195 is an intriguing future problem .",

    "this indicates the presence of the zero surface around the jump , in accord with the above picture [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : rkw_tp](d ) ] . in fig .  1 in ref .  , which plotted the arpes spectra at the fermi level , a similar structure to fig .",
    "[ fig : edope](c ) was found while it clearly shows a finite intensity in some regions on the @xmath151 line .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with the zero surface on the @xmath151 line assumed in ref .   for hole - doped cases , but",
    "compatible with our zero surface around @xmath108 as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : edope](g ) and ( h ) .",
    "in summary , we have shown that various spectral anomalies observed in the pseudogap states of hole- or electron - doped cuprates are naturally understood in terms of underlying pole - zero structure of electronic green s function .",
    "the pole - zero structure has been calculated for the paramagnetic metallic phase in the 2d hubbard model with employing the cdmft+ed at @xmath61 and the cdmft+ctqmc at @xmath62 .",
    "we have confirmed that the cumulant periodization scheme @xcite is suited for the parameter region of our interest , namely lightly doped mott insulator in the intermediate to strong coupling region , since the cumulant is well localized within the cluster that we employed , as demonstrated in appendix b. this corroborates the convergence and reliability of our momentum resolution in the studies on fermi surface topology and the differentiation in the momentum space .",
    "furthermore , the cumulant periodization is useful since it enables to study the coexistence of pole and zero surfaces .",
    "the result calculated by cdmft+ed shows a pseudogap in the lightly doped region around the mott insulator .",
    "the pseudogap is characterized by a low - energy zero surface , which connects the bifurcated low - energy bands [ fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](a ) ] . in hole - doped cases",
    "the lower band cuts the fermi level while the upper one resides at the energy higher than and adjacent to the pseudogap above the fermi level .",
    "this directly leads to ( i ) the non-@xmath1-wave character of the fully opened pseudogap and ( ii ) the spectral asymmetry around the fermi level .",
    "looking into the structure around @xmath8 we have also found that a large re@xmath46 around the zero surface causes ( iii ) the back - bending dispersion .",
    "all of ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) are consistent with experiments semiquantitatively .",
    "the agreement imposes a strong constraint on theories for pseudogap : although ( ii ) and ( iii ) have been interpreted as evidences of the preformed pairing in the literatures , ( i ) is in sharp contrast to @xmath1-wave - gap scenarios including those by preformed pair .",
    "it is compatible neither with other precursory or real @xmath1-wave - type symmetry breakings such as @xmath1-density wave nor with commensurate antiferromagnetism .",
    "we have confirmed a full gap formation at the nodal point in a larger - cluster calculation in appendix c. moreover , the non-@xmath1-wave gap is supported by the agreement of our result on the pseudogap structure with that observed by arpes for electron - doped cuprates .",
    "the zero mechanism also enables a simple and unified understanding of various spectral anomalies : in hole - doped cases the same zero surface which causes the back - bending behavior around the antinode induces the incoherence around @xmath8 , fermi pockets and fermi arcs , while a pile of pole and zero surfaces at a higher binding energy results in the high - energy kink ( waterfall ) and the incoherence around @xmath108 .",
    "moreover we have found a low - energy kink structure in the nodal dispersion . on the other hand , in electron - doped cases the zero surface which constitutes the pseudogap crosses the fermi level around @xmath108 , making electron pockets around the antinodes . all these features are consistent with experimental results .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the zero surface does not result from symmetry breakings , but is a direct consequence of the strong correlation effect , i.e. , proximity to the mott insulator .    to elucidate the effect of zeros at finite temperatures",
    ", we have also implemented cdmft+ctqmc calculations .",
    "the results qualitatively agree with those of cdmft+ed with a smearing factor @xmath79 , which confirms that the thermal scatterings broaden the effect of zeros and indeed create the characteristic spectra similar to those observed in the cuprates .    to conclude , the origins of various anomalies in the electronic structure of the normal state in the high-@xmath0 cuprates are unified into the presence of the low - energy zero surface which persists against doping . the zero surface is also expected to cause anomalous metallic behaviors in other physical quantities , such as the specific heat , electronic resistivity , and hall coefficient.@xcite comparisons of these quantities with experiments remain for future studies .",
    "although the microscopic mechanism creating the zero surface has not been discussed in this paper , it has emerged clearly as the proximity to the mott insulator .",
    "the similarity in the structure of the zero surfaces between the pseudogap and the mott gap in the undoped system [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) in ref .",
    "] also implies the mott origin of the pseudogap . at the same time , however , the pseudogap does not appear as that directly or continuously connected to the zero surface which forms the mott gap in the undoped state .",
    "this is because , for example in the hole - doped case , the zero surface creating the fully - opened pseudogap is bounded above by the existence of low - energy excitations far below the upper hubbard band ( uhb ) .",
    "the reason why the ingap states are separated by the pseudogap from the main quasiparticle band is left for an important future issue . in ref .",
    "we proposed a scenario in which the emergence of such a zero surface in the low - energy scale and the resultant pseudogap are a remnant of the binding of doubly occupied site ( doublon ) and empty site ( holon ) drastically weakened by the screening of coulomb repulsions by mobile carriers .",
    "this has something to do neither with any symmetry breaking nor with its precursor .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that a gap arising from hybridization between the quasiparticle and a composite fermion excitation is responsible for the pseudogap and the related zero surface .",
    "@xcite possible supplementary role of strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations are left for future studies .",
    "further study on the mechanism of pseudogap will be described elsewhere .",

    "here we note that a standard periodization technique , which substitutes @xmath45 to eq .",

    "however , this situation does never occur in eq .",
    "( [ eq : periodize ] ) with @xmath45 unless @xmath207 or @xmath208 for all @xmath74 inside the gap , and these conditions are never satisfied as far as both @xmath21 and @xmath18 are nonzero and finite .    as a matter of fact",

    "we see that zeros of @xmath2 exist only at the fermi level without a dispersion , and that poles of @xmath2 extend to the fermi level around @xmath108 from the positive @xmath74 side and around @xmath8 from the negative @xmath74 side , making the density of states half metallic .",
    "this failure of the @xmath46 periodization in the mott insulator is ascribed to the fact that @xmath46 is not localized within the @xmath53 cluster.@xcite the nonlocality of @xmath46 is a direct consequence of the presence of dispersive zeros of @xmath2 , i.e. , momentum - dependent divergence of @xmath46 .",
    "as we have discussed so far , zeros of @xmath2 still persist in doped mott insulators up to a critical doping level beyond which the fermi liquid emerges",
    ". therefore @xmath46 should be highly nonlocal also in the non - fermi - liquid region and the @xmath46 periodization again breaks down there . on the contrary , the cumulant @xmath50 is well localized within the @xmath53 cluster in this region , as we mentioned in sec .",

    "b we give another numerical evidence for the locality of the cumulant in doped mott insulators .",
    "here we present a cdmft+qmc result for an @xmath209 cluster in a parameter region of doped mott insulators .",
    "we use the hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite and calculate the cluster cumulant @xmath52 for @xmath82 , @xmath31 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .",
    "figures [ fig : cum](a ) and ( b ) show @xmath212 dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the cumulant @xmath213 , respectively , where @xmath214 is the real - space vector connecting the sites @xmath16 and @xmath43 in the cluster [ the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cum](b ) ] .",
    "we notice that @xmath215 , ( 1,0 ) , and ( 1,1 ) components are much larger than the other components at longer distances .",
    "this can be more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cum](c ) , where the cumulant at the lowest matsubara frequency , @xmath216 , is plotted against the euclidean distance , @xmath217 .",
    "we find that the cumulant is well localized within the @xmath53 cluster , which justifies the @xmath50 periodization .",
    "although the cumulant at @xmath61 might be more extended than that at @xmath211 , we do not have a tractable way to examine it for a cluster larger than @xmath53 .",
    "it is worthwhile , however , to note that the finite - temperature results obtained by our cdmft+ctqmc calculation are consistent with the cdmft+ed results with finite @xmath79 s , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : arc ] .",
    "this fact implies that the @xmath50 periodization with @xmath53 cluster still remains a good approximation even at @xmath61 .",
    "to demonstrate the fully - opened pseudogap in a larger cluster , we implement an 8-site cluster calculation with cdmft+ctqmc .",
    "we calculate the spectral function @xmath101 at @xmath218 , where the @xmath1- and @xmath219-wave ( fully - opened ) pseudogaps are most distinguishable . the spectral function is obtained from @xmath220 through the maximum - entropy method .",
    "figure [ fig:8site ] shows @xmath221 for @xmath114 , @xmath31 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the small but clear gap just above the fermi level at @xmath158 proves the fully - opened pseudogap.@xcite the gap vanishes at a higher temperature @xmath211 .",
    "this is why the previous dca study @xcite at a high temperature @xmath222 did not observe the gap .",
    "note that , a very recent study with 8-site dca @xcite at @xmath158 also detected a wispy reduction of the spectral weight at @xmath223 at low doping though the signal was so weak that it was not explicitly analyzed in their paper .",
    "the weakness of the signal would be due to the flat momentum dependence of the self - energy in each momentum patch in the dca .",
    "although the suppression of the spectrum is more subtle at higher doping in their result , it is reasonable because the pseudogap temperature decreases with doping .",

    "<S> we study electronic structure of hole- and electron - doped mott insulators in the two - dimensional hubbard model to reach a unified picture for the normal state of cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors . by using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean - field theory , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that structure of coexisting zeros and poles of the single - particle green s function holds the key to understand mott physics in the underdoped region . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidence for the emergence of non - fermi - liquid phase caused by the topological quantum phase transition of fermi surface by analyzing low - energy charge dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra calculated in a wide range of energy and momentum reproduce various anomalous properties observed in experiments for the high-@xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that the pseudogap in hole - doped cuprates has a @xmath1-wave - like structure only below the fermi level , while it retains non-@xmath1-wave structure with a fully opened gap above the fermi energy even in the nodal direction due to a zero surface extending over the entire brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the non-@xmath1-wave pseudogap , the present comprehensive identifications of the spectral asymmetry as to the fermi energy , the fermi arc , and the back - bending behavior of the dispersion , waterfall , and low - energy kink , in agreement with the experimental anomalies of the cuprates , do not support that these originate from ( the precursors of ) symmetry breakings such as the preformed pairing and the @xmath1-density wave fluctuations , but support that they are direct consequences of the proximity to the mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> several possible experiments are further proposed to prove or disprove our zero mechanism . </S>"
