    "the stochastic two - patch model we introduced and studied in @xcite is simply the process when the network of interactions consists of two vertices connected by a single edge .",
    "the main objective was to answer the following question : starting with one empty patch and one patch at carrying capacity , does the inclusion of mixing events lead to a global extinction , i.e. , both patches in state 0 eventually , or to a global expansion , i.e. , both patches in state 1 eventually ?",
    "theorem 8 in @xcite gives the following answer : when the migration factor is small , the probability of global extinction , respectively , global expansion , is close to one when the allee threshold is larger than one half , respectively , smaller than one half .",
    "as the migration factor increases , the limit becomes less predictable .",
    "this result suggests that one half is a critical value for the allee threshold .",
    "however , we literally interpreted this one half as one patch initially in state 1 divided by two patches , and also conjectured that , for systems in which all the patches are connected , i.e. , the network of interactions is a complete graph , the critical value for the allee threshold is equal to the initial fraction of patches in state 1 in the limit as the size of the system tends to infinity .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the last diagram of figure [ fig : regular ] which shows numerical results for the stochastic process on four regular graphs with different degrees .",
    "in contrast , the first diagram suggests that the critical value for the allee threshold is again equal to one half for the process on the ring in the limit as the size of the system tends to infinity .",
    "this indicates that the critical value for the allee threshold strongly depends on the initial configuration in the presence of strong long range dispersal whereas the initial configuration is essentially unimportant in the presence of weak short range dispersal .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to explain at least qualitatively this difference between the process on the complete graph , which models strong dispersal , and the process on the ring , which models weak dispersal .",
    "we first assume that the process starts from the product measure in which each vertex is in state  1 with probability @xmath11 and in state 0 otherwise . following the terminology of @xcite , we call global extinction the event that the process converges to the `` all 0 '' configuration and global expansion the event that it converges to the `` all 1 '' configuration .",
    "note that , on finite graphs , the process converges to one of these two absorbing states .",
    "in particular , the probability of global extinction and the probability of global expansion sum up to one , thus showing that the long - term behavior is completely characterized by the probability of global expansion @xmath12 which depends on the network of interactions , the allee threshold , the migration factor , and the initial density of occupied patches .",
    "the simulation results of figure [ fig : regular ] suggest some monotonicity of the probability of expansion with respect to the allee threshold and the initial density of occupied patches , as well as a certain symmetry between the probability of expansion and the probability of extinction .",
    "these results follow directly from standard coupling arguments for interacting particle systems that we briefly describe without detailed proof .",
    "* monotonicity with respect to @xmath6 *  two processes on the same graph and starting from the same initial configuration but with different allee thresholds can be coupled in such a way that the process with the smaller allee threshold dominates the other process , which implies that the probability of global expansion @xmath13 is nonincreasing with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "* monotonicity with respect to @xmath11 *  two processes on the same graph , with the same allee threshold , and with the same migration factor can be coupled in such a way that if one process dominates the other one at time 0 then the domination remains true at all times .",
    "this implies that the probability of global expansion @xmath13 is nondecreasing with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "* symmetry *  the process with allee threshold @xmath6 can be coupled with the process on the same graph and with the same migration factor but with allee threshold @xmath14 in such a way that if at any vertex the initial population density for one process equals one minus the initial population density for the other process then this remains true at all times .",
    "this implies that @xmath15 and explains the symmetry in the four simulation pictures of figure [ fig : regular ] .    *",
    "the process starting with a single occupied patch *  we now return to the main objective of this paper , which is to understand the effect of the geometry of the network on the invadability of species subject to a strong allee effect .",
    "this aspect is mathematically more difficult to understand because two processes on different graphs can not be coupled in such a way that one process dominates the other one .",
    "our analysis focuses on the extreme cases of the ring and the complete graph corresponding to the first and last diagrams of figure [ fig : regular ] .",
    "let @xmath16 where the @xmath17 and @xmath18 superscripts allude respectively to the fact that the complete graph is the connected regular graph with the largest degree while the ring is the connected regular graph with the smallest degree . recall that the simulation results of figure [ fig : regular ] suggest that @xmath19 whereas for the process on the ring starting with @xmath20 , @xmath21 following @xcite whose main objective was to understand whether an alien species established in one patch can expand in space , we assume from now on that the process starts with a single patch in state 1 and all the other patches in state 0 . in particular , we drop the parameter @xmath11 in the probabilities .",
    "the following two theorems give qualitative differences between the system on the complete graph and the system on the ring starting with a single vertex in state 1 , which supports the conjectures and .",
    "more precisely , our first theorem indicates that , even when the allee threshold is very small , the system on the complete graph is driven toward global extinction with high probability when the number of vertices is large .    ",
    "[ thm : complete ] assume that @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath23 as @xmath24",
    ".    in contrast , when the allee threshold is small enough , the system on the ring expands globally with a positive probability that does not depend on the number of vertices .    ",
    "[ thm : ring ] assume that @xmath25 .",
    "then , @xmath26 .",
    "the mysterious assumption in the previous theorem follows from a series of bounds of certain probabilities that are estimated based on geometric arguments and are not optimal .",
    "some of these estimates appear in our proof and the other ones in the calculation of an upper bound for the critical value of one dependent oriented site percolation in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "even though the assumption of the theorem is far from being optimal , it gives at least an explicit lower bound for the critical value of the allee threshold for the process on the ring .",
    "more importantly , the combination of both theorems show the following qualitative difference : for some values of the allee threshold , the probability of global expansion is bounded from below for the process on the ring but vanishes to zero for the process on the complete graph as the number of vertices increases .",
    "this supports at least qualitatively the contrast between and . from an ecological perspective",
    ", this indicates that , upon arrival of an alien species to a new area , though dispersal is necessary for its expansion , the best strategy is to first only disperse to nearby patches , and then progressively increase the strength of its dispersal as the fraction of patches at carrying capacity increases .",
    "this section gives some definitions and simple results that will be used repeatedly in the proof of both theorems . throughout this paper , we think of the process as being constructed from a harris graphical representation @xcite . each edge of the graph is equipped with a poisson process with intensity one while each vertex is equipped with a poisson process with intensity one and a sequence of independent bernoulli random variables with parameter 1/2 .",

    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm : complete ] .",
    "as previously mentioned , the first step is to study the process that excludes local events but includes mixing events .",
    "it is obvious that , when starting with a single vertex in state 1 , this process eventually hits a lower configuration provided the number of vertices is sufficiently large .",
    "the key to the proof is to show that the time to hit a lower configuration can be made arbitrarily small , which relies on large deviation estimates for several random variables that we now define .",
