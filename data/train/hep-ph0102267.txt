    "a microscopic understanding hadron - hadron scattering remains an elusive goal of hadronic physics .",
    "this is unfortunate because the interactions of hadrons is important from a variety of perspectives . at the hadronic level",
    ", it provides vital insight into the dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "it is also relevant to the search for the quark gluon plasma , since hadronic interactions can mask putative signals for the qcd phase transition .",
    "applications extend beyond hadronic physics : for example the search for cp violating phases in the final states of @xmath0 of @xmath1 decays will require correctly accounting for strong interaction final state phases@xcite . of course , hadron - hadron interactions are directly relevant to a longstanding goal of nuclear physics  deriving the nuclear force from qcd .",
    "this issue is not just of intellectual concern since it is important to be able to extend our understanding of internuclear forces to extreme conditions ( of temperature and pressure ) so that a variety of astrophysical and cosmological issues may be reliably examined .",
    "given the importance of the area , it is not surprising that a number of techniques have been developed to address the dynamics of hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "these roughly fall into two classes : those which treat hadrons as elementary fields and those which attempt to describe the interactions using qcd as the starting point . among the former are potential approaches@xcite ( bonn , paris , argonne ) , relativistic hydrodynamic approaches@xcite , and a variety of effective field theories@xcite ( chiral perturbation theory , effective nn theory ) . among the latter are lattice gauge theory@xcite , schwinger - dyson models@xcite , light cone field theory@xcite , a multigluon dipole interaction model@xcite , and constituent quark models .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to summarize the advantages and faults of all of these methods here .",
    "rather , the remainder of this document focuses on attempts to describe hadronic interactions which are based on the nonrelativistic constituent quark model ( cqm ) .",
    "the cqm is beyond a doubt the most widely used description of the static properties of hadrons  largely because it is able to describe hundreds of experimental data with a handful of parameters in a comparatively simple picture .",
    "thus it is no surprise that attempts to describe hadronic interactions with the cqm have a long history @xcite . despite the well - known short comings of the cqm ( some of which will be discussed below ) the benefits are immediately apparent : the cqm may be applied to _ any _ hadronic interactions and the predictions _ are essentially parameter - free_. by this i mean that the parameters of the cqm are very strongly fixed by comparison with static hadron properties  there is no wiggle room when computing interactions ! of course",
    "the extension of the cqm to dynamic properties of hadrons requires some extrapolation ; however , this should not form a barrier in itself . to paraphrase feynman , ",
    "trust your model and see how far it takes you . \"",
    "in the following we shall consider a cqm which includes coulomb and linear central potentials , a spin - spin colour hyperfine interaction , and possibly spin - orbit and tensor interactions .",
    "it may be somewhat of a surprise that the breit - fermi interactions are included here since they are normally only required to achieve detailed agreement with spectroscopic and other static properties of the hadrons .",
    "however , as we shall see shortly , subleading ( in @xmath2 ) interactions can dominate hadronic scattering !",
    "a great deal of effort has been expended on variational@xcite and resonating group approaches@xcite to scattering in the cqm . here",
    "i describe a simplified approach where one evaluates the t - matrix at born order@xcite , called the  quark born diagram \" ( qbd ) method . the t - matrix for meson - meson scattering",
    "is shown diagrammatically in fig 1 .",
    "the diagrams represent momentum flow in the born order term of the neumann series and must be attached to external mesonic wavefunctions .",
    "quark exchange must occur to maintain asymptotic colour singlet states . in doing these computations",
    "one needs to be aware that scattering with composite objects can be very different than pointlike objects .",
    "for example , hermiticity of the scattering amplitude is no longer trivial but requires that the wavefunctions be exact eigenstates of @xmath3 .",
    "this property is related to the  post - prior \" discrepancy@xcite .",
    "furthermore , consistency of the kinematical relationships must be maintained with the hamiltonian ( nonrelativistic hamiltonians require nonrelativistic kinematics to maintain hermiticity ) .",
    "also , one can not change parameters at will ! for example , mesonic radii or quark masses can not be independently modified .",
    "one must instead adjust a hamiltonian parameter , solve for the spectrum again , and then evaluate the t - matrix .",
    "+      the application of the quark born formalism requires some care .",
    "for example , if one is to restrict attention to the terms shown in fig 1 , then channels where strong quark annihilation effects are expected ( such as @xmath4 @xmath5 ) should be avoided .",
    "furthermore , if the predicted interactions are strong , the born order results should be iterated ( this is discussed below ) .",
    "the quark born diagram method has been applied to a variety of hadronic reactions .",
    "these include i=2 @xmath5 scattering@xcite ( with surprising agreement considering the relativistic and chiral nature of the pion ) , i=3/2 @xmath6 scattering@xcite ( testing bose symmetry breaking due to the strange quark mass ) , @xmath7 scattering@xcite ( demonstrating surprising agreement in the s - wave and a dramatic failure in the p - wave@xcite ) , short range @xmath8 scattering@xcite ( in agreement with resonating group computations ) , @xmath9 scattering @xcite ( in agreement with lattice computations ) , @xmath10 scattering@xcite ( in strong disagreement with previous estimates and in agreement with rudimentary data ) , @xmath11 scattering@xcite ( an examination of the generation of hadronic spin orbit and tensor interactions from the quark level ) , and possible meson - meson bounds states@xcite ( the @xmath12 may be identified as a @xmath13 bound state ) .    a comparison of the predicted and experimental isotensor s - wave @xmath5 phase shifts is shown in fig 2 . a sample cross section prediction relevant to charm suppression at rhic is shown in fig 3 .",
    "as mentioned above , the cqm in general , and the qbd formalism in particular , suffers from several inadequacies .",
    "we summarize several of these and discuss methods for addressing them .",
    "perhaps the simplest problem arises when the scattering is so strong that the tree level diagrams of the qbd method are inaccurate .",
    "this may be tested by comparing qbd predictions to more complete resonating group calculations ( which iterate the scattering to all orders and can , in principle , include the effects of coupled channels , wavefunction distortion , etc ) .",
    "such a comparison of @xmath14 scattering in isospin 2 was made in ref .",
    "@xcite where the accuracy of the qbd results were explicitly demonstrated .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth observing that strong interactions may be accounted for by extracting effective potentials for the process in question and iterating the potential in the appropriate schrdinger equation .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig 4 , where the effective @xmath5 interaction has been extracted from the qbd @xmath5 t - matrix and iterated in the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "this is shown as a dashed line . evidently , the agreement with data is ruined by this procedure ( i am presenting the worst possible case  the procedure works very well in general ) .",
    "this is because the light mass of the pions ( and the large invariant masses at which the formalism is being applied ) requires relativistic kinematics to be employed ( this has been used in the qbd prediction of fig 2 ) .",
    "thus the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation is inappropriate for iterating the effective @xmath5 interaction .",
    "+    a related problem is the nonlocality of the @xmath5 t - matrix ( because composite particles are being scattered ) .",
    "any extracted effective potential which is local will induce unknown errors after being iterated .",
    "fortunately , all three problems may be dealt with by choosing to solve for the t - matrix directly in momentum space :    @xmath15    as is evident from the equation , nonlocal effective potentials may be directly employed ( in fact these are proportional to the qbd t - matrices ) , unitarity is automatically restored , and nonrelativistic kinematics may be incorporated by use of the relativistic dispersion relation for @xmath16 .",
    "this is illustrated as the dotted line in fig 4 , where one sees that the effect of iterating the @xmath5 potential is to weaken the scattering at higher invariant mass .",
    "to this point attention has been restricted to ` exotic ' channels such as i=2 , where resonance contributions are forbidden .",
    "we now examine the issues involved in relaxing this constraint .",
    "two possible intermediate states may be realized ( at least at lowest order in the fock space expansion ) , annihilation to intermediate mesons or annihilation to intermediate hybrid mesons .",
    "the latter process involves an intermediate state consisting of a quark ",
    "antiquark pair and a ` gluon ' ( where the gluon may be an excited flux tube or a constituent gluon , depending on one s picture of soft glue ) .    the nonrelativistic reduction of the one gluon exchange potential which describes the coupling of a @xmath17 pair to an intermediate perturbative gluon is@xcite    @xmath18    however , the intermediate state in this case is a hybrid , which typically has a mass some 1000 mev above low lying mesons with the same quark content .",
    "thus one may expect that it is more realistic to employ a gluon propagator with a fictitious mass of roughly 1 gev .",
    "one may incorporate this into the expression above by multiplying it by a factor @xmath19 which is to be fit to the data and which we expect to be roughly -1 .",
    "this rather speculative adjustment can be verified by comparing reactions with no annihilation to similar reactions where annihilation is permitted .",
    "for example , i=2 @xmath5 scattering may be compared to i=0 @xmath5 ; i=3/2 @xmath20 scattering may be compared to i=1/2 @xmath20 ; and @xmath21 scattering may be compared to @xmath22 scattering .",
    "all indicate that a negative value of @xmath19 is required ; a fit yields @xmath23@xcite .",
    "even a cursory examination of typical hadronic scattering data reveals the importance of intermediate resonance states .",
    "unfortunately the mechanism by which hadrons couple is poorly understood and surely involves complicated nonperturbative gluodynamics .",
    "the current best guess is the purely phenomenological @xmath24 model in which @xmath17 pairs are created with vacuum quantum numbers and combine with the parent quarks to produce the daughter mesons .",
    "extensive calculations of meson and baryon decays have been made with moderate success ( typical errors in the amplitude are 20% or less)@xcite .    incorporating the @xmath24 model directly into the quark model is the most direct way to include the effects of intermediate resonances .",
    "this may be achieved most simply by writing the quark model in second quantized notation and including a @xmath24 term which creates and annihilates @xmath17 pairs .",
    "this is multiplied by a constant @xmath25 which may be determined by comparison to a specific channel ( say , @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath27    the field theory is simplified by restricting the fock space to the meson and meson - meson sectors of interest .",
    "thus we project onto @xmath28 , @xmath29 by making the following ansatz for the exact eigenstate :    @xmath30    varying the reduced hamiltonian matrix element with respect to the unknown meson @xmath31 and meson - meson @xmath32 wavefunctions yields the coupled channel schrdinger equation :    @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the interquark radius in the meson channel and @xmath35 is the intermeson distance in the meson - meson channel .",
    "remarkably there is a simple relationship between these coordinates : @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 represent the exchange kinetic energy , potential , and normalization kernels respectively .",
    "wavefunctions with a ` naught ' subscript @xmath40 represent mesonic wavefunctions without the effects of channel mixing ( so that we have assumed no wavefunction distortion in deriving this equation ) .",
    "the first of these equations is the nonrelativistic quark model ( @xmath41 ) supplemented with a term which couples it to the meson - meson continuum  thereby ` unquenching ' the quark model .",
    "the second equation is the resonating group equation which describes meson - meson scattering in the cqm ( the born order t - matrix for this equation is provided by the qbd ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath25 provides the desired coupling to intermediate resonances .",
    "eqns ( 5,6 ) may be solved with standard coupled channel methods and the effects of unquenching the quark model and of intermediate resonances in scattering problems may be examined .",
    "an example of this is given in fig 5 where the effect of coupling virtual @xmath42s to the @xmath5 p - wave channel is studied .",
    "the @xmath42 mass has been shifted down 80 mev while the bare width is 10 mev , this corresponds to an ` rpa ' width of 90 mev@xcite .",
    "+      the apparently successful description of @xmath5 scattering evident in fig 1 is perhaps surprising given the chiral nature of the pion and its interactions at low energy . explaining this success will go a long way towards explaining the unwarranted success of the cqm in the light quark sector@xcite .",
    "one way to do this is to construct a model of strong qcd which incorporates the physics of chiral symmetry breaking at a microscopic level .",
    "in this way one may compute @xmath5 scattering with composite particles while observing the dictates of chiral symmetry .",
    "it is possible to construct such a model by assuming a nontrivial qcd vacuum ( typically a bcs - type vacuum ) and building states on this vacuum with the random phase approximation to the full bethe salpeter equation .",
    "this has been done in coulomb gauge qcd@xcite , with similar calculations in the schwinger - dyson approach @xcite",
    "studying and understanding hadronic interactions is vital to hadronic physics and is an important part of nuclear and electroweak physics .",
    "it is probable that a microscopic description of hadronic interactions is necessary if one wishes to understand these phenomena in extreme conditions or in poorly known channels .",
    "the constituent quark model provides an excellent starting point for developing the understanding required to construct a reliable model of strong qcd . in the meantime",
    ", it also serves as an excellent phenomenological guide to the interpretation of scattering experiments .",
    "the development of continuum field theoretic models capable of describing hadrons and their interactions is in its infancy  we look forward to their maturation and application to reaction processes .",
    "the author thanks the organizers of the hirschegg workshop for their labours and for introducing the participants to the delights of the kleinwalsertal .",
    "a large portion of the work described here was performed with ted barnes and adam szczepaniak .",
    "the author is grateful to paul geiger for discussions on coupled channels .",
    "this work was supported by the us doe under contracts de - fg02 - 00er41135 and de - ac05 - 84er40150 .",
    "an example of such phases has just become known to us .",
    "preliminary measurements by e852 indicate that the difference of the @xmath43 system in s and d wave at the mass of the @xmath44 is @xmath45 degrees .",
    "this is to be compared to the prediction of @xmath46 degrees@xcite .",
