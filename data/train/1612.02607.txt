    "a ubiquitous theme in mathematics is the contrast between linear and non - linear structures . in algebraic settings , linear objects such as vector spaces ,",
    "abelian groups , and modules tend to have a highly structured and accessible theory , while non - linear objects , such as groups , rings , or algebraic varieties are more wild , and harder to analyze . for example , understanding maps @xmath1 between algebraic varieties is a complicated non - linear problem , but to understand the sections of a vector bundle on @xmath2 is much more accessible . non - linear objects often admit interesting * linear invariants * which are fairly computable and easy to manipulate .",
    "homological algebra then typically enters the picture , extending a given invariant to a collection of derived ones .",
    "an extremely useful idea which can be applied in a variety of contexts is to try to translate a non - linear problem into a collection of * linear problems*. for example , maps @xmath3 of algebraic varieties which are very close to a fixed map @xmath4 can be understood by studying linear problems involving the pulled back tangent bundle @xmath5 . in a different direction , many problems involving solvable groups can be reduced to an iteration of linear problems involving abelian groups .",
    "to streamline this idea one would like to have a formal framework to understand what linear objects are and how one can `` linearize '' a given non - linear object .",
    "one way to do so is the following .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the category of abelian groups .",
    "a locally presentable category @xmath7 is called * additive * if it is tensored over @xmath6 .",
    "we note that in this case the tensoring is essentially unique and induces a natural enrichement of @xmath7 in @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath8 is a locally presentable category then there exists a universal additive category @xmath9 receiving a colimit preserving functor @xmath10 .",
    "the category @xmath9 can be described explicitly as the category of * abelian group objects * in @xmath8 , namely , objects @xmath11 equipped with maps @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfying ( diagramatically ) all the axioms of an abelian group .",
    "we may then identify @xmath10 with the functor which sends @xmath15 to the free abelian group @xmath16 generated from @xmath15 , or the * abelianization * of @xmath15 .",
    "although this yields a procedure for replacing objects in a category by linear objects , such linear approximations tend to be too coarse if one is studying maps between objects , rather than the objects themselves . instead , when studying maps @xmath17 one is often interested in linear invariants of @xmath18 * over @xmath15*. a way to do this formally was developed by beck in  @xcite , where he defined the notion of a * beck module * over an object @xmath15 ( say , in a locally presentable category @xmath8 ) to be an abelian group object of the slice category @xmath19 .",
    "simple as it is , this definition turns out to capture many well - known instances of `` linear objects over a fixed object @xmath15 '' .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 is a group and @xmath21 is a @xmath20-module then the semi - direct product @xmath22 carries a natural structure of an abelian group object in @xmath23 .",
    "one can then show that the association @xmath24 determines an equivalence between the category of @xmath20-modules and the category of abelian group objects in @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath25 is the category of associative unital rings then one may replace the formation of semi - direct products with that of * square - zero extensions * , yielding an equivalence between the notion of a beck module over a ring @xmath26 and the notion of an @xmath26-bimodule , i.e. , an abelian group equipped with compatible left and right actions of @xmath26 ( see  @xcite ) . when @xmath26 is a commutative ring the corresponding notion of a beck module reduces to the usual notion of an @xmath26-module . for an example of a different nature ,",
    "if @xmath8 is a grothendieck topos and @xmath27 is an object then @xmath28 is also a topos and there exists a small site @xmath29 such that @xmath28 is equivalent to the category of sheaves of sets on @xmath30 .",
    "a beck module over @xmath2 then turns out to be the same as a sheaf of abelian groups on @xmath30 .",
    "we can therefore summarize by saying that the notion of a beck module provides one with a robust abstract framework which indicates , in a given non - linear context , what are the relevant linearized counterparts .    in the realm of algebraic topology , one linearizes spaces by evaluating * cohomology theories * on them .",
    "this approach is closely related to the approach of beck : indeed , by the classical dold - thom theorem one may identify the ordinary homology groups of a space @xmath2 with the homotopy groups of the free abelian group generated from @xmath2 ( considered , for example , as a simplicial abelian group ) .",
    "the quest for more refined invariants has led to the consideration of * generalized cohomology theories * and their classification via homotopy types of * spectra*. the extension of cohomological invariants from ordinary cohomology to generalized cohomology therefore highlights spectra as a natural extension of the notion of `` linearity '' provided by abelian groups .",
    "the passage from abelian groups to spectra is a substantial one , even from the homotopy - theoretic point of view .",
    "indeed , one should observe that in a homotopical context there is a natural notion of an @xmath31-group object , obtained by interpreting the axioms of an abelian group not strictly , but up to coherent homotopy .",
    "for spaces , it turns out that specifying an @xmath31-group structure on a given space @xmath32 is equivalent to specifying , for every @xmath33 , an @xmath34-connected space @xmath35 , together with a weak equivalence @xmath36 .",
    "such a datum is also known as a * connective spectrum * , and naturally extends to the general notion of a spectrum by removing the connectivity conditions on @xmath35 .",
    "this passage from connective spectra ( or @xmath31-group objects ) to spectra should be thought of as an extra linearization step that is possible in a homotopical setting , turning additivity into * stability*. it has the favorable consequence that kernels and cokernels of maps become equivalent up to a shift .",
    "using stability as the fundamental form of linearity is also the starting point for the theory of * goodwillie calculus * , which extends the notion of stability to give meaningful analogues to higher order approximations , derivatives and taylor series for functors between @xmath0-categories . replacing",
    "the category of abelian groups with the @xmath0-category of spectra means we should replace the notion of an additive category with the notion of a * stable @xmath0-category*. the operation associating to a locally presentable category @xmath8 the additive category @xmath9 of abelian group objects in @xmath8 is now replaced by the operation which associates to a presentable @xmath0-category @xmath8 its @xmath0-category @xmath37 of * spectrum objects in @xmath8 * , which is the universal stable presentable @xmath0-category receiving a colimit preserving functor @xmath38 .",
    "the construction of beck modules as a form of linearization and the homotopical notion of linearization through spectra were brought together in  @xcite under the the framework of the * abstract cotangent complex formalism*. given a presentable @xmath0-category @xmath8 and an object @xmath39 , one may define the analogue of a beck module to be a * spectrum object * in the slice @xmath0-category @xmath19 . with a geometric analogy in mind ,",
    "if we consider objects @xmath40 of @xmath19 as paths in @xmath8 , then we may consider spectrum objects in @xmath19 as `` infinitesimal paths '' , or `` tangent vectors '' at @xmath15 .",
    "as in  @xcite , we will consequently refer to @xmath41 as the * tangent @xmath0-category * at @xmath15 , and denote it by @xmath42 . just like",
    "the tangent space is a linear object , we may consider @xmath42 as linear , being a stable @xmath0-category .",
    "this analogy is helpful in many of the contexts in which linearization plays a significant role .",
    "furthermore , it is often useful to assemble the various tangent categories into a global object , which is then known as the * tangent bundle @xmath0-category * @xmath43",
    ".    an important consequence of the linearization process encompassed in the cotangent complex formalism is that it allows one to produce cohomological invariants of a given object @xmath39 in a universal way .",
    "the resulting cohomology groups are known as * quillen cohomology groups * , and take their coefficients in the tangent @xmath0-category @xmath42 . in order to study quillen cohomology",
    "effectively one should therefore understand the various tangent @xmath0-categories @xmath42 in reasonably concrete terms .",
    "one of the main theorems of  @xcite identifies the tangent categories of algebras in a presentable stable @xmath0-category over a given ( unital , coherent ) @xmath0-operad with the corresponding operadic module categories .",
    "earlier results along these lines were obtained in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that this is indeed analogous to what happens in the discrete case of beck modules .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 is the @xmath0-category of @xmath31-ring spectra then the above results identify the tangent @xmath0-category @xmath44 at a given @xmath31-ring spectrum @xmath15 with the @xmath0-category of @xmath15-modules in spectra .",
    "this allows one , for example , to identify the quillen cohomology theory of @xmath31-ring spectra with topological andr - quillen cohomology .",
    "our main motivation in this paper is to generalize these results to the setting where the algebras take values in an @xmath0-category which is * not necessarily stable*. this allows one , in principle , to compute tangent categories in much more general algebraic settings , and consequently identify the category of coefficients for the associated quillen cohomology .",
    "for example , it allows one to compute tangent categories and quillen cohomology of objects such as * simplicial categories * , or more generally enriched categories , an application which is described in a subsequent paper  @xcite .    for various reasons we found it convenient to work in the setting of combinatorial model categories .",
    "using this setting our main result can be formulated as follows ( see corollary  [ c : sum - comparison ] below ) .",
    "[ t : main - intro ] let @xmath45 be a differentiable , left proper , combinatorial symmetric monoidal model category and let @xmath46 be an admissible colored symmetric operad in @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a fibrant @xmath46-algebra such that the enveloping operad @xmath47 is stably admissible and @xmath48-cofibrant .",
    "then the quillen adjunction @xmath49 & \\t_a\\operatorname{mod}_a^{\\p}(\\m ) \\ar@<1ex>[l]_-{\\downvdash}}\\ ] ] induced by the free - forgetful adjunction is a quillen equivalence .",
    "when every object in @xmath45 is cofibrant and @xmath46 is a cofibrant single - colored operad then the enveloping operad @xmath47 is stably admissible and @xmath48-cofibrant for every @xmath46-algebra @xmath15 by work of fresse ( @xcite , see remark  [ r : fresse ] ) .",
    "this is also true when @xmath45 is the category of simplicial sets and @xmath46 is an arbitrary cofibrant colored open by work of rezk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the construction of stabilizations in the model categorical setting can be done in many ways ( see  @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , most constructions assume given a self quillen adjunction realizing the loop - suspension adjunction .",
    "unfortunately , such a structure is not always readily available . with an eye toward future applications we hence chose to dedicate the first section of this paper to setting up a more flexible model for the stabilization ( based on ideas of heller and lurie ) in which one does not need to assume such additional structures .",
    "theorem  [ t : main - intro ] identifies , under suitable assumptions , the tangent model category at a given operadic algebra @xmath15 with the tangent category to @xmath15 in the model category of @xmath15-modules .",
    "this latter tangent category can be further simplified into something which resembles a functor category with stable codomain .",
    "to make this idea precise it is useful to exploit the global point of view obtained by assembling the various tangent categories into a * tangent bundle*. this can be done in the model categorical setting by using the machinary of  @xcite , and is carried out in ",
    "[ s : global ] .",
    "the final identification of @xmath50 then takes the following form ( see corollary  [ c : sum - comparison-2 ] below ) :    [ c : sum - comparison-2-into ] let @xmath51 and @xmath15 be as in theorem  [ t : main - intro ] .",
    "then we have a natural quillen equivalence @xmath52 ^ -{\\simeq } & \\operatorname{fun}^{\\m}_{/\\m}(\\p^a_1,\\t\\m ) \\ar@<1ex>[l]_-{\\downvdash}\\\\ } \\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the enveloping category of @xmath15 and @xmath54 denotes the category of @xmath45-enriched lifts @xmath55\\\\ \\p^a_1\\ar[r]_{a}\\ar@{ .. >}[ru ] & \\m } \\ ] ] of the underlying @xmath15-module @xmath56 .",
    "theorem  [ t : main - intro ] , while pertaining to model categories , can also be used to obtain results in the @xmath0-categorical setting , using the rectification results of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this is worked out in  [ s : infinity ] , where the following @xmath0-categorical analogue of the above result is established ( see theorem  [ t : compoo ] ) :    [ t : compoo - intro ] let @xmath7 be a closed symmetric monoidal , differentiable presentable @xmath0-category and let @xmath57 be the operadic nerve a fibrant simplicial operad .",
    "then the forgetful functor induces an equivalence of @xmath0-categories @xmath58    here @xmath59 is the @xmath0-category of @xmath15-modules in @xmath7 , which is closely related to the @xmath0-operad of @xmath15-modules defined in @xcite ( see section [ s : infinity ] ) . in the special case where @xmath7 is stable the conclusion of theorem  [ t : compoo - intro ] reduces to the following result of lurie ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.3.4.13 ) :    if , in addition to the above assumptions , @xmath7 is stable , then there is an equivalence of @xmath0-categories @xmath60    while theorem  [ t : compoo - intro ] is only applicable to @xmath0-operads which are nerves of simplicial operads ( these are most likely all of them , see  @xcite,@xcite ) , it also applies to @xmath0-operads which are not necessarily unital or coherent , as is assumed in  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7.3.4.13 ) .",
    "we also note that the model categorical statement theorem  [ t : main - intro ] can handle not only simplicial operads , but also operads which are * enriched in @xmath45*. for example , this allows one to consider operads such as the lie or poisson operad , which do not come from simplicial operads , and thus are not covered by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.3.4.13 ) .",
    "such statements would most likely be translatable to an @xmath0-categorical language as soon as a suitable theory of enriched @xmath0-operads is set up .",
    "this is a first in a series of papers concerned with the abstract cotangent complex formalism and its applications . in a subsequent paper  @xcite",
    "we will further develop the aspects of the theory pertaining to quillen cohomology and obstruction theory .",
    "we then use the main comparison results of this paper to study the tangent categories and quillen cohomology of * enriched categories * and * @xmath0-categories*. for example , using theorem  [ t : main - intro ] we obtain following corollary in loc .  cit .",

    "the aim of this section is to associate to a  sufficiently nice  pointed model category @xmath45 a model category @xmath63 of spectrum objects in @xmath45 which presents the universal stable @xmath0-category associated to the @xmath0-category underlying @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath45 is a simplicial model category , one can use the suspension and loop functors induced by the simplicial ( co)tensoring to give explicit models for spectrum objects in @xmath45 by means of bousfield - friedlander spectra or symmetric spectra ( see @xcite ) . in non - simplicial contexts",
    "this can be done as soon as one chooses a quillen adjunction realizing the loop - suspension adjunction . for the purposes of this paper",
    "it is desirable to have a uniform description of stabilization which does not depend on a simplicial structure or any other specific model for the loop - suspension adjunction .",
    "we will consequently follow a variant of the approach suggested by heller in  @xcite , and describe spectrum objects in terms of @xmath64-diagrams ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "let us begin with an informal discussion outlining the approach .",
    "let @xmath45 be a pointed model category , let @xmath65 be a cofibrant object and @xmath66 a fibrant object .",
    "the key idea is that specifying a map of the form @xmath67 , or equivalently , a map @xmath68 , is essentially equivalent to giving a commuting square @xmath69\\ar[d ] & z\\ar[d]\\\\ z'\\ar[r ] & y } } \\ ] ] in @xmath45 in which the objects @xmath70 and @xmath71 are weakly contractible .",
    "the square   is homotopy cocartesian if and only if the corresponding map @xmath72 is an equivalence , and is homotopy cartesian if and only if the adjoint map @xmath73 is an equivalence .",

    "we shall now make the approach outlined above more precise . recall that a * zero object * in a category is an object which is both initial and terminal and that a * weak zero object * in a model category @xmath45 is an object",
    "whose image in @xmath78 is a zero object .",
