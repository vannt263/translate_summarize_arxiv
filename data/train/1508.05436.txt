    "almost all the galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of mass @xmath4 in its center ( @xcite ) , where @xmath5 kg is the solar mass .",
    "the mass of the smbh is observed to have firm correlations with the basic components of the galaxy .",
    "for example in the case of classical bulge ( cb ) , its mass @xmath6 has the relation @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .. in the case of globular clusters ( gc ) , the number of them @xmath8 in a galaxy has the relation @xmath9 ( @xcite )",
    ". therefore it might be natural to think that the galaxy and its smbh have co - evolved in their lives .    however , the standard coagulation of the stellar size black holes to form smbh within a limited time scale turns out to be very difficult ( @xcite ) .",
    "this difficulty has become prominent by the recent observations ( @xcite ) that report many mature smbh exist at around @xmath10 ( only @xmath11years after big bang ) .",
    "various attempts to form these smbh through the co - evolution with galaxies seem to be unnatural ( @xcite ) , without assuming seed black holes of huge mass @xmath12 .",
    "moreover there seems to be an evidence that the above black hole / bulge mass relation @xmath7 has already been established or even the coefficient increases toward the past ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of these facts strongly suggest that the smbh are primordial .",
    "therefore in this paper , we start from the hypothesis that mature smbh have been formed at around @xmath2 on top of the standard @xmath3cdm model .",
    "then the formation of all the structures , _",
    "i.e. _ the stars , globular clusters , and bulges , should be attributed to this smbh .",
    "these structures will quickly feed back to the smbh .",
    "thus the galaxy - smbh co - evolution would have taken place in the very early stage and the several correlations above ( @xcite ) would have already been established then .",
    "the early formation of smbh at around @xmath2 has been studied in the model that the bose - einstein condensation of the self - interacting boson fields forms the dark energy ( @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the unstable uniform condensation of the field can collapse to form smbh everywhere in the universe .",
    "this is possible because the coherent condensation does not have velocity dispersion which prevents the collapse .",
    "furthermore in this model , the non - condensate component of the boson gas can contribute as the thermal dark matter around the smbh .",
    "the gravitational potential of this dark matter attracts baryon gas , and the smbh will form a strong jet beyond the present size of the galaxy .",
    "this is plausible from the many observations at present although the jet ejection mechanism is not at all clear so far ( @xcite ) .",
    "this jet will compress the surrounding gas and trigger massive star formation there especially in the dense gas environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "these first stars will build globular clusters ( gc ) , the classical bulges ( cb ) in spiral galaxies ( sg ) , and the main body of the elliptical galaxies ( eg ) .",
    "this physics is closely related with the mechanism in ( @xcite ) which displays the correlation between the smbh mass @xmath13 and the velocity dispersion @xmath14 of the stars in cb .",
    "this scenario is briefly explained in section 2 .    according to the above scenario",
    ", the stars of gc and cb in the spiral galaxies , would have the same origin and are indistinguishable with each other . on the other hand , their clustering features are different ; gc are extended in halo and cb forms the core of the galaxy .",
    "this divide may come from the two distinguished flows of gas in the primordial galaxy .",
    "we clarify these flows and the origin of distinct clustering features in section 3 .",
    "furthermore an apparent similarity of cb ( in sg ) and eg suggests that the eg and sg have the common origin .",
    "the fact that sg is smaller than eg , in average , suggests that the strength of the jet from smbh or the mass of smbh are thought to be the major factor to distinguish sg and eg",
    ". we will find much interesting parameter which clearly distinguish sg and eg in our model described in section 4 .",
    "we try to find the simplest model extracting the most relevant physics from very complicated galaxy formation processes .",
    "limitations and prospects of our approach are described in the final section 5 .",
    "we briefly examine a possible origin of the primordial smbh which was formed first before any other components of the galaxy .",
    "it is clear that the coagulation of the stellar size black holes to form smbh takes too long time , more than the dynamical relaxation time scale @xmath15 , which turns out to be @xmath16years , where @xmath17 are the velocity dispersion , mass , mass density , number of the black holes , and the gravitational constant , respectively . to bring this time scale within the cosmic age @xmath18years , we need seed black holes of mass @xmath19 to start with .",
    "furthermore dark matter gas is hopeless to collapse into smbh because of its velocity dispersion and the angular momentum .",
    "the only possibility will be the collapse of the condensed field whose uniform component forms the dark energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is possible if the dark energy is the bose - einstein condensation of fields ( mass @xmath20 ) with an attractive self - interaction(@xmath21 ) .",
    "the condensate is characterized by the classical scalar field @xmath22 in the metric , assuming spherical symmetry , @xmath23 and obeys the equation of motion , @xmath24 this set of equations easily forms black hole even if mass - less non - interacting case , which was often used to analyze critical behavior in the black hole formation process ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was concluded that the resultant black hole mass shows scaling properties . on the other hand ,",
    "more realistic bound for the black hole formation comes from the quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , it turns out that even the quantum fluctuations can not prevent the collapse of the condensation to black hole if the mass of the boson field exceeds the kaup limiting mass ( @xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the planck mass . if the boson mass is the order of the present dark energy @xmath27 , then the limiting mass becomes@xmath28 kg , almost the planet pluto mass .",
    "after the adiabatic collapse of the dark energy , some portion of the condensation becomes a black hole ( @xcite ) and some other portion will melt to form thermal boson gas around the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "this latter melting process of the condensation depends on many complex conditions and has not yet been clarified",
    ". however it would be natural to suppose that it settles down to the thermal equilibrium of mass density @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance from the central smbh and @xmath31 are constants",
    ". then this thermal uncondensed gas behaves as dark matter ( @xcite ) since it yields the commonly observed flat rotation curve .",
    "suppose that the smbh thus formed at @xmath2 is already surrounded by the thermal gas of dark matter with well developed gravitational potential",
    ". then baryons are attracted within the free fall time scale about @xmath32 years . at the same time",
    "the smbh would yield energetic jets , which may trigger massive star formation along it through the ram pressure of the bow shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the effect of the jet for star formation is not yet fully understood as well as the jet formation mechanism itself .",
    "we do not go deep into these problems in this paper . if the jet conveys the momentum to the ambient baryon gas , then the pressure compresses the gas to promote the star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the jet conveys the energy to the gas , then the heat makes the gas expand to prevent the star formation . among numerous arguments on the both directions",
    ", there seems to be a plausible direction ( @xcite ) that promotion and prevention of star formation coexist depending on the parameters such as the gas density and inhomogeneity . in general the dense environment , such as in the early stage of the universe or in the center of the gravitational potential , prefers the promotion of star formation . on the other hand the dilute environment prefers",
    "the prevention and disperses the gas clouds .",
    "all the above arguments are for a steady jet with fixed direction .",
    "if the jet changes its direction rapidly less than the free fall time scale , as we will argue in the next section , then the trajectory envelope of the jet will form a superposed shock wave shells .",
    "a similar argument appears in ( @xcite ) which displays the formation of the correlation between the mass @xmath13 of the smbh and the velocity dispersion @xmath14 in galactic bulge . if the typical outflow radiation balances in momentum with the ambient gas of size @xmath33 , then we have @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the baryon mass of the galaxy , _",
    "i.e. _ the fraction @xmath36 of the total mass @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the eddington limiting luminosity where @xmath39 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "then using the virial equilibrium relation @xmath40 , we have ( @xcite ) , @xmath41 this successfully describes the observations ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "if we supposed energy balance , we have an extra factor @xmath42 on the right hand side of eq.([eq : mom ] ) , and @xmath43 .",
    "this predicts too small mass of smbh and conflicts with observations .",
    "thus the observed @xmath44 relation is consistent with the momentum balance , which suggests the jet / outflow - induced star formation . as argued in the above",
    ", this star formation must have taken place in the early stage of the universe . this burst - mode star formation induced by energetic jets",
    "should be distinguished from the spontaneous mild star formation later time when the jets generally expel and heat up the ambient gas to prevent the burst - model star formation .",
    "now we examine how smbh triggers star formation and makes basic components of galaxy . the first stars , as well as their direct descendants formed after the first supernova explosions , are thought to be the main ingredients of the galaxy components : classical bulge ( cb ) , globular clusters ( gc ) and the elliptical galaxies ( eg ) .",
    "these components must be formed at the same time and same mechanism since observations indicate that all of them are composed from very old population - ii stars .",
    "then how these separations into components are processed ?",
    "we first consider the separation into gc and ellipsoids ( _ i.e. _ the cb and the main body of eg ) .",
    "we consider that there had been two different kinds of gas velocity fields .",
    "one is caused by the local gravitational potential , and the other caused by the global cosmic turbulent flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "the former velocity is given by the virial equilibrium and becomes a constant @xmath45 .",
    "this is implied by the previous isothermal distribution of dark matter density @xmath46 .",
    "the latter is the scaling velocity @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "this is derived by the scaling property of the cosmic turbulence ( @xcite ) .",
    "this cosmic turbulence is naturally expected from the equation for the self - gravitating fluid , whose fourier transform    @xmath49    is similar to the smoluchowski coagulation equation . the scaling relation derived from this equation is applied to various observations such as the scale dependent mass density , @xmath50 ratio , magnetic field distributions , etc .",
    "they all consistently point the value @xmath51 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the former virial velocity dominates for @xmath52 and the latter turbulent velocity dominates for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 if we assume @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .. the random nature of the turbulent flow yields fluctuations on top of the flat rotation velocity profile produced by the relaxed dark matter .",
    "therefore the rotation velocity may increase or decrease outward .",
    "however the average on these fluctuations may reproduce the flat profile of the rotation curve . ]     from the central smbh .",
    "there are two distinct velocity fields : the constant virial velocity field @xmath55 ( broken blue , dominates inward ) and the increasing turbulent velocity field @xmath56(solid red , dominates outward ) .",
    "they are equal with each other at @xmath54 .",
    "a star formed at @xmath52falls down toward the smbh and forms a bulge , while the star at @xmath53 stays far from the smbh and forms globular clusters .",
    "[ fig:1],width=302 ]    the baryon gas is exerted the ram pressure from the jet and forms stars .",
    "the stars in the near region @xmath52 falls down toward the center of the potential loosing the pressure balance and suffered friction .",
    "eventually they will form a big cluster that we call classical bulge ( cb ) .",
    "supernova explosions and subsequent star formation may continue . on the other hand the stars formed from the gas in the far region @xmath53 have higher speed beyond the virial equilibrium and have less probability to fall .",
    "therefore these stars remain far from the center possibly forming small clusters that we call globular clusters ( gc ) .    there are some specific features of the above scenario which may be significant in comparison with observations : ( a ) all the stars in gc and cb have the same age and chemical components because they are formed by the same gas triggered by the common jet at the same time .",
    "( b ) each gc has almost no local angular momentum .",
    "this is because each gc is formed in the finite region where the relative gas speed is small and coherent according to the relation @xmath56 ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) . reflecting this small velocity dispersion at small scale ,",
    "each gc becomes compact with the typical size @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "( c ) gc are loosely bounded to the galaxy since they tend to have higher velocities @xmath59 than the virial equilibrium @xmath60 .",
    "therefore there may be significant number of stray gc in between galaxies .",
    "this point should be considered in wider viewpoint including the dwarf spheroidal galaxies@xcite . in summary ,",
    "cb and gc are the same species but separated into two phases by two distinct velocity fields .",
    "next we consider the separation into the spiral ( sg ) and elliptical ( eg ) galaxies in our scenario of mature smbh .",
    "apart from the disk , the classical bulge ( cb ) in sg , and eg are composed from the old population - ii stars as globular clusters ( gc )",
    ". therefore it would be natural to think that cb and eg are the same species but in different phases .    in order to demonstrate this process of separation",
    ", we introduce a simple model for the massive star formation by jets .",
    "we concentrate on the very basic physics behind first in order to explore the plausible mechanism for galaxy formation at present .",
    "therefore our model is simply a representative one among many possible models .",
    "suppose the energetic jet from smbh hits the ambient gas that is isotropically distributed around the smbh .",
    "we assumed that the jet triggers the gas to form stars .",
    "then those stars formed in the near region @xmath52 fall down toward he center",
    ". some of them will give torque on the smbh through the deformation of the accretion disk .",
    "then the jet from smbh changes its direction since the jet direction is thought to be parallel to the smbh rotation axes . in the new direction of the jet , there will be plenty of fresh gas ready to form stars .",
    "thus the jet will trigger new star formation in this rich gas environment .",
    "this yields further torque on the smbh .",
    "this feedback dynamics will be simply represented by the following model :    @xmath61_{n}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{s_{i}}\\right|^{\\alpha}|\\overrightarrow{j}(t)|g_{i}(t),\\\\ \\dot{\\vec{j}}(t)= & -\\lambda[\\overrightarrow{j}(t)\\times\\sum\\nolimits _ { i}\\overrightarrow{s_{i}}\\dot{g}_{i}(t)]_{n}\\sum\\nolimits _ { i}\\dot{g}_{i}(t)-\\kappa\\overrightarrow{j } , \\end{array}\\label{eq:4}\\ ] ]    where the vector @xmath62 represents the jet ( direction = axes of the jet , amplitude = strength of the jet ) .",
    "the scalar @xmath63 represents the amount of gas in the @xmath64-th direction @xmath65 , where @xmath66 covers the whole solid angle .",

    "this is proportional to the star formation rate @xmath73 , the strength of the jet toward the direction @xmath64 with the jet collimation parameter @xmath67 , and the amount of gas at that direction @xmath63 .",
    "the second line represents the time change rate of the jet .",
    "this is proportional to the feeding efficiency @xmath74 of the formed star to the smbh , and the torque exerted by the falling stars just formed . a natural fade - out term parametrized by @xmath39 is added .    .",

    "[ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "( b ) the jet is less active and the direction is not wildly changed .",
    "there are finite remaining gas that failed to form stars and distributed almost perpendicular direction to the jet ( fig .",

    "no gas is left .",

    "the remaining gas outward would be scattered and lost by the turbulence .",

    "this further exert strong torque and this runaway continues until all the gas is exhausted . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath74 is small , then the falling stars exert only weak torque to change the jet direction .",
    "then the jet can not hit the sufficient amount of fresh gas to yield torque and eventually the jet direction is settled , leaving the torus shape gas distribution around the central bulge .",

    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig.2].,width=302 ]    this galaxy formation process has similar physics to the forest - fire model in complex systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model is composed of many trees on a two - dimensional lattice .",

    "if ignite , the fire spreads to the neighboring trees with some probability .",
    "on the site of the burnt tree , a new tree has a chance to grow with some probability .",
    "the main feature is that the fire - fire correlation length @xmath83 , depends on @xmath82 , determines the asymptotic two distinct states : ( a ) the fire dies out if @xmath83 exceed the system size @xmath84 .",

    "percolation caused by the positive feed back or runaway process is the common feature in our galaxy model and the forest - fire model although the former is deterministic , as eq.([eq:4 ] ) , and the latter is probabilistic .    in our model , the parameter of accretion rate @xmath74 may particularly be important to divide the galaxies into the elliptical and spiral ( fig.[fig:5 ] left ) .",

    "the former stars mainly form the population i and the latter the population ii . in sg ,",
    "the ambient gas was initially irregular and inhomogeneous just after the formation because of the random jets .",
    "this primordial sg will eventually form regular disk around the central bulge by consuming their locally excess kinetic energy to trigger new star formation through the shocks . therefore",
    "the apparent irregular sg will evolve toward regular sg .",
    "these are the distinctive trend of our scenario among other theories of galaxy formation including the merger hypothesis .",
    "we proposed a scenario that the primordial supermassive black hole ( smbh ) made the galaxy .",
    "energetic jets from the smbh give ram pressure to trigger the massive star formation in the primordial dense gas environment .",
    "we focused on the following two aspects of this scenario .",
    "the first aspect is the comparison of a globular cluster ( gc ) and a classical bulge ( cb ) . according to our scenario , they are the same species but in distinct phases .",
    "we proposed that the difference comes from two kinds of velocity fields of the gas around the smbh : ( a ) the virial velocity field @xmath90 associated with the dark matter distribution that dominates inside of the galaxy , and ( b ) the cosmic turbulent field , which obeys the kolmogorov scaling @xmath91 , that dominates outside .",
    "some portion of the star formed by the jet in ( a ) falls into the center and yields cb . on the other hand",
    "the star formed in ( b ) stays in halo and yields compact gc reflecting the characteristic kolmogorov velocity field .",
    "thus the two species cb and gc are formed simultaneously from the same gas , but in distinct velocity fields .",
    "the second aspect is the comparison of the spiral galaxies ( sg ) and the elliptical galaxies ( eg ) . according to our scenario , cb ( in sg ) and",
    "eg are the same species but in distinct phases .",
    "we proposed that the difference comes from the amount of jet activity .",
    "we introduced a simple model that describes this discrimination . according to this , ( a ) large star formation rate @xmath73 ( for example in the dense gas environment ) and large feeding efficiency @xmath74 ( for example in the case of small angular momentum ) make strong feedback torque on smbh that causes runaway flipping of the jet direction in the whole solid angle . finally all the gas is exhausted and an eg is left . on the other hand ( b )",
    "small @xmath73 and @xmath74 make weak torque and the jet direction change mildly without runaway .",
    "this makes smaller cluster in the center ( cb ) and the leftover gas will eventually form a disk , leaving a sg .",
    "thus the existence / absence of the runaway separates the same species into two phases .",
    "this process has the common physics to the forest - fire model in complex systems .",
    "thus a smbh defines the center of a galaxy and various star clusters in the galaxy ( gc , cb , eg ) are nurtured by the smbh through the energetic jet emanating from the smbh . according to this scenario",
    ", the hypothesis of the population - iii stars that formed spontaneously may not be necessary .",
    "our simple analysis may be a useful supplement to the solid simulations of galaxy formation including all physical processes .",
    "we have ignored many detail dynamics such as the star formation process , back reaction to the jet , jet formation and collimation , and transfer of the angular momentum , etc .",
    "we wanted to extract the most relevant physics in the complex galaxy formation process and to construct a natural model based on them .",
    "we would like to report how the elaboration of our model including the above fundamental processes can be possible in our future study .",
    "several final remarks are in order .",
    "the jet activity may leave its trace in the faint structures in a spiral galaxy .",
    "the final stage of the jet would be gentle and the jet will generally have small precession . this jet may form a double - cone shape region in which the stars are massively formed .",
    "subsequent supernova explosions of those stars may leave high energy electrons and protons there captured and stored in the magnetic fields .",
    "this relic ionized region will be observed in the early galaxies .",
    "however this relic structure may be contaminated with the relatively recent jet activity which often observed ( @xcite ) .    in our scenario , a smbh always defines the center of the galaxy .",
    "therefore even the expelled smbh , after multiple merger of galaxies , if any , will form a new galaxy independently around it . in any case ,",
    "galaxy merger is not a dominant process in our scenario .",
    "rather , we expect a cluster of smbh which will be formed by the instability of the huge condensed field . in this case ,",
    "multiple smbh are expected to form on a plane after the collapse of the condensation in the form of pancake .",
    "this process does not destroy any of the @xmath3cdm model in which the dark matter forms individual gravitational potential .",
    "actually we simply need a tiny fraction of those dark matter cluster becomes condensed and collapse to form smbh .",
    "we hope we will soon be able to report these considerations by checking the fundamental processes theoretically and observationally .",
    "the author would like to thank hideaki mouri , akika nakamichi , tohru tashiro , and all the laboratory members of ochanomizu university for fruitful discussions and critical comments ."

    "<S> supermassive black holes ( smbh ) of size @xmath0 are common in the universe and they define the center of the galaxies . a galaxy and the smbh are generally thought to have co - evolved . </S>",
    "<S> however , the smbh can not evolve so fast as commonly observed even at redshift @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore smbh must form first before galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to clarify how this mature smbh forms galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we clarify the mechanism how the smbh designs variety of structures of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we explore a natural hypothesis that the smbh has been formed mature at @xmath2 before stars and galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the smbh forms energetic jets and outflows which trigger massive star formation in the ambient gas . </S>",
    "<S> they eventually construct globular clusters and classical bulge as well as the body of elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we propose simple models which implement these processes along with the standard @xmath3cdm - model . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the globular clusters and classical bulges have a common origin but are in different phases . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the elliptical and spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> physics behind these phase division is the runaway star formation process with strong feedback to smbh . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the forest - fire model that displays self - organized criticality . </S>",
    "<S> finally we speculate several observational predictions that may help to test the present arguments .    </S>",
