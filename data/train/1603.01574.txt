    "general relativity is one of the pillars of our modern understanding of the universe , deserving a certain degree of familiarity from all those who purport to study nature , whether from a philosophical or mathematical point of view .",
    "the theory has such pristine logical purity that it can be comprehensively summarized by john a. wheeler s famous quip : [ sentence : wheeler ] we should not forget however , that ensconced within wheeler s sentence is our conception of spacetime as a dynamical geometrical arena of reality : no longer a fixed stage where physics unfolds , it is part and parcel of the play of existence .    in mathematical terms , we have : [ equ : gr ] given the sources , one will determine a geometry given by the spacetime metric @xmath0  the ` matter tells spacetime how to curve ' bit .",
    "conversely , it can be shown that very light , very small particles will roughly follow geodesics defined by the geometry of the lhs of the equation  the ` spacetime tells matter how to move ' part .    a mere decade after the birth of gr , along came quantum mechanics , the new radical kid on the block .",
    "it was a framework that provided unprecedented accuracy in experimental confirmation , predictions of new physical effects and a reliable compass for the construction of new theories . and yet",
    ", it has resisted the intuitive understanding that was quickly achieved with general relativity .",
    "a much less accurate characterization than wheeler s quip for general relativity has been borrowed from the pessimistic adage  everything that can happen , does happen \" .",
    "the sentence is meant to raise the principle of superposition to the status of core concept of quantum mechanics ( whether it expresses this clearly or not is very much debatable ) .    in mathematical terms",
    ", the superposition principle can be seen in the schroedinger equation : [ equ : schroedinger ] = -iwhose linearity implies that two solutions @xmath1 and @xmath2 add up to a solution @xmath3 . in the path integral",
    "representation it is built - in .",
    "the very formulation of the generating function is a sum over all possible field configurations @xmath4 , [ generating ] [ j]= where @xmath5 is the lagrangian density .",
    "unfortunately , for the past 90 years , general relativity and quantum mechanics have not really gotten along .",
    "quantum mechanics , the ` new kid on the block ' , soon claimed a large chunk of territory in the theoretical physics landscape , leaving a small sliver of no - man s land also outside the domain of general relativity . in most regimes , the theories will stay out of each other s way - domains of physics where both effects need to be taken into account for an accurate phenomelogical description of nature are hard to come by .",
    "nonetheless , such a reconciliation might be necessary even for the self - consistency of general relativity : by predicting the formation of singularities , general relativity  predicts its own demise \" , to borrow again the words of john wheeler .",
    "unless , that is , quantum effects can be suitably incorporated to save the day at such high curvature regimes .      at an abstract level ,",
    "the question we need to face when trying to quantize general relativity is : how to write down a theory that includes all possible superpositions and yet yields something like equation in appropriate classical regimes ?",
    "i for one am willing to consider a theory that incorporates these two principles as a successful candidate for a theory of quantum gravity .    indeed ,",
    "although the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics can be of technical character , it is widely accepted that it has more conceptual roots .",

    "gravity is a non - linear theory , which means that geometrical disturbances around a flat background can act as sources for the geometry itself .",
    "the problem is that unlike what is the case in other non - linear theories , the ` charges ' carried by the non - linear terms in linearized general relativity become too ` heavy ' , generating a cascade of ever increasing types of interactions once one goes to high enough energies .",
    "there are theories , such as horava - lifschitz gravity @xcite , which seem to be naively perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "the source of renormalizability here is the greater number of spatial derivatives as compared to that of time derivatives .",
    "this imbalance violates fundamental lorentz invariance , breaking up spacetime into space and time .",
    "unfortunately , the theory introduces new degrees of freedom that appear to be problematic ( i.e. their influence does not disappear at observable scales ) .    and perhaps perturbative non - renormalizability is not the only problem .",
    "indeed , for some time we have known that a certain theory of gravity called ` conformal gravity ' ( or ` weyl squared ' ) is also perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "the problem is that the theory is sick .",
    "conformal gravity is not a unitary theory , which roughly means that probabilities will not be conserved in time .",
    "but , which time ? and is there a way to have better control over unitarity ?    [ [ a - problem - of - time ] ] a problem of time + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    at a more formal level , to combine with our principle of superposition one should keep in mind that space - times define causal structures , and it is far from clear how one should think about these in a state of superposition .",
    "for instance , which causal structure should one use in an algebraic quantum field theory approach when declaring that space - like separated operators commute ?",
    "quantum field theory is formulated in a fixed spacetime geometry , while in general relativity spacetime is dynamical . without a fixed definition of time or an a priori distinction between past and future",
    ", it is hard to impose causality or interpret probabilities in quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , in the s - matrix approach to quantum gravity @xcite , one can define the transition amplitude @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the @xmath7-matrix whose generating functional is given by , with @xmath8 . from a projection of the liouville measure  and also omitting the required gauge - fixings and fadeev - popov determinant present in the case of gauge - symmetries .",
    "] indeed , in such cases one can find ( pseudo)unitarity and diffeomorphism invariance ( the action is still non - renormalizable of course ) .",

    "one can only perform this construction if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are asymptotic states , at @xmath11 . in these regions ,",
    "diffeomorphisms are quite restricted , generating only rigid transformations . in the first place . ]",
    "no such general relativistic construction can be applied for the more realistic case in which @xmath12 represent boundary states of a finite time interval .",

    "[ a - dynamical - approach ] ] a dynamical approach + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    can we formulate quantum gravity in a way which reflects the fundamental distinction between space and time ?",
    "one way of approaching this question is to first use a more dynamical account of the theory . we do nt need to reinvent such an account ",
    "it is already standard in the study of gravity , going by the acronym of adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind a dynamical point of view is to set up initial conditions on a spatial manifold @xmath18 and construct the spacetime geometry by evolving in a given auxiliary definition of time .",
    "indeed most of the work in numerical general relativity requires the use of the dynamical approach .",
    "such formulations allow us to use the tools of the hamiltonian formalism of quantum mechanics to bear on the problem . with these tools , matters regarding unitarity",
    "are much easier to formulate , because there is a time with respect to which probabilities are to be conserved .",
    "however , since the slicing of spacetime is merely an auxiliary structure , the theory comes with a constraint  called the hamiltonian constraint  which implies a freedom in the choice of such artificial time slicings .",
    "the metric associated to each equal time slice , @xmath19 , and its associated momenta , @xmath20 , must be related by the following relation at each spatial point : [ equ : hamiltonian ] h:=r-(^ab_ab-^ 2)=0 where @xmath17 stands for the determinant of the metric .",
    "the constraints are commonly thought to guarantee that observables of the theory should not depend on the auxiliary ` foliation ' of spacetime . however , as first shown in @xcite , redefinitions of surfaces of simultaneity in the canonical theory can only be translates as a proper hamiltonian flow if one restricts attention to those space - times that satisfy the einstein equations of motion .",
    "in other words , the hamiltonian formalism embodies this sacred principle of relativity only on - shell .",
    "and we should also be wary that the hamiltonian formalism might be throwing the baby out with the bathwater .",
    "the freedom to refoliate spacetime implied by also contains the generator of time evolution .",
    "in other words , time evolution becomes inextricably mixed with a certain type of gauge - freedom , leading some to conclude that in gr evolution is  pure gauge \" .",
    "this is one facet of what people have called  the problem of time \" ( see e.g. @xcite ) . upon a naive quantization of",
    ", one gets the infamous wheeler - dewitt equation : [ equ : wdw ] h = 0 where @xmath21 $ ] is a wave - functional over the space of three - geometries .",
    "and thus the classical ` problem of time ' gets transported into the quantum regime .",
    "one could look at equation as a _ time - independent _ schroedinger equation , which brings us again to the notion of  frozen time \" , from .",
    "a solution of the equation will not be subject to time evolution ; it will give a frozen probability wave - function on the space of three - geometries .",
    "other canonical approaches have so far similarly found insurmountable problems with the quantization of this constraint .",
    "i contend that this is because local time reparametrization represents an effective , but not fundamental symmetry .",
    "i.e. i contend that _ invariance under refoliation is not present at a quantum mechanical level , but should be recovered dynamically for states that are nearly classical .",
    "_ in fact , it is _ already the case _ that the hamiltonian formalism represents changes of surfaces of simultaneity as a symmetry only on - shell .",
    "all we want is to extend this property to other possible formulations of gravity .",
    "nonetheless , apart from all of the technical difficulties , the property of timelessness represented by equation should remain in any theory that is completely relational , in that it would not contain an explicit time variable .",
    "briefly summarized , relationalism is the belief that all relevant physical information , including time , should be deducible by the relation between physical objects .",
    "thus the presence of an external time is odd from the point of view of relationalism , and should be extractable from internal properties of curves in configuration space .    as a last remark in this section , i would like to point out that the presence of an auxiliary global time parameter parametrizing a curve in conformal superspace does _ not _ imply that one could detect a preferred surface of simultaneity .",
    "duration is extracted from the local change in the physical degrees of freedom of the field , and should be thus completely relational , with no reference to background structures ( see however the end of appendix [ app : examples ] , for differences that could arise to the general relativistic notion of refoliation invariance ) .",
    "[ sec : topology ]",
    "it could be argued that we do not  experience \" space - times .",
    "we experience ` one instant at a time ' , so to say .",
    "we of course still appear to experience the passage of time , or perhaps more accurately , we ( indirectly ) experience changes in the spatial configuration of the world around us , through changes of the spatial configuration of our brain states .",
    "but if present experience is somehow distinguished , how does  change \" come about ?",
    "this is where parmenides has something to say that is relevant for our discussion .",
    "parmenides was part of a group called the eleatics , whose most prominent members were himself and zeno , and whose central belief was that all change is illusory .",
    "the reasoning that led them to this conclusion was the following : if the future ( or past ) is real , and the future is not existing now , it would have both properties of existing and not existing , a contradiction ( or a ` turning back on itself ' ) . without past and future",
    ", the past can not transmute itself into future , and thus there is also no possible change .",
    "of course , the argument hinges on the distinction we perceive between present , past and future .",
    "aristotle was able to give convincing arguments rebuking zeno s paradox , by conceding that there is no time without change , but maintaining that time should not be identified with change .",
    "instead , change was just a measure of time , or , in aristotle s own words :  change is the unit of time \" . like numbers ,",
    "change would be something capturing an existing aspect of nature , without itself being part of nature . for aristotle , time is like the real line .",
    "however , he argues , the time it takes to get from one place to another is not actually composed of an infinite number of finite lengths of time .",
    "unfortunately , neither parties of the argument had the tools of calculus at their disposal , with which all of these notions can be made precise . without these tools",
    "the argument was not completely resolved , but was largely deemed to be answered by aristotle .",
    "but even aristotle did not fully provide an answer to what time is supposed to be when past and future can not exist .",
    "augustine of hippo noticed the loophole in aristotle s argument , and picked up the question .",

    "of course , one should then use the effective action to that scale , as opposed to the bare action above .",
    "these issues are briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "the following definitions are taken from @xcite .",
    "they assume that configuration space ( or reduced configuration space ) possesses a metric , with respect to which one can define tubular neighborhoods of given radii around non - intersecting paths .",
    "@xmath201 is the space of unparametrized paths between @xmath202 and @xmath4 .",
    "a _ tubular neighborhood _ of a given path @xmath35 in @xmath22 is roughly a small enough tube around @xmath35 such that the tube does nt self - intersect .",
    "more precisely , a tubular neighborhood of a submanifold @xmath203 embedded in a riemannian manifold @xmath204 is a diffeomorphism between the normal bundle of @xmath203 and an open set of @xmath204 , for which the zero section reduces to the identity on @xmath203 .",
    "one first defines the exponential map ( that the exponential map is still well defined in the infinite - dimensional setting is shown in @xcite ) , @xmath205 . restricting the exponential map to the normal bundle of @xmath35 ( i.e. to act only on vectors orthogonal to @xmath206 ) , @xmath207 , since @xmath35 is compact , one can always find a maximum radius @xmath208 such that there are no self - intersections of the tubular neighborhood , i.e. @xmath209 is a diffeomorphism between @xmath210 ( normal vectors with maximal length @xmath208 ) and its image in @xmath211 .",
    "defining coarse  grained histories between two configurations @xmath212 and @xmath213 , requires us to first define a collection of subsets of @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "the amplitude kernel for @xmath216 is : w_:=_c_(t)e^-is[(t)]/ using the configuration space metric ( which defines extremal paths as geodesics ) , we have the orthogonal plane @xmath217 . a basis for all the deviation vector fields from the classical path , @xmath218 ,",
    "can be formed by all the vectors in @xmath219 .",
    "thus , for each deviation vector field @xmath220 from @xmath221 , we can form the one - parameter family of paths @xmath222 given by [ deviation]_x(u , t):=_(t)+__(t)(ux(t))where @xmath223 .",
    "we define the set of coarse - grained paths seeded by @xmath224 with radius @xmath200 as : [ coarse_graining ] c_^=\\{_x(u )  |   u } this is a particular set of paths ; not defined by all those that do nt enter the region .",
    "it thus avoids criticisms of halliwell regarding the definition of coarse - grainings by crossing properties of regions of space - time ( here , configuration space ) , @xcite .",
    "we already have a @xmath208 given above by the no - intersection criterion .",
    "now , to define the minimum one , we consider the partial transition amplitude : [ coarse_transition ] w_,(_i,_f)=_c_^ now , by the results of @xcite , if there is a single extremal path @xmath221 between @xmath225 , there exists a small enough radius such that w_,(_i,_f)__w(_i,_f ) where the approximation works up to orders of @xmath226 .",
    "now , of course , for a large enough @xmath200 , the partial amplitude stops approximating the full amplitude .",
    "it is no longer a good sampling of all the paths , e.g. the exponential might even cease being a local diffeomorphism",
    ". it might not be able to detect a second extremal path away from @xmath221 for example , since it does not comprise all possible variations there .",
    "this is represented by the fact that for higher order of approximations one requires higher order of derivatives of @xmath227 $ ] .",
    "since in practice we do nt have access to the full path integral , only to approximations , we should be content in having not an absolute minimum radius , but an optimal radius only up to some order of approximation : [ rhomin ] ^_()=(_^+(|w_,(_i,_f)-w(_i,_f)| < ) ) roughly , assuming that at some point the error starts increasing with @xmath200 ( for instance , at some point the riemann exponential map might even cease to be a diffeomorphism ) , this should be the largest radius , if it exists , such that @xmath228 .",
    "now we define    [ def : ecs ] an @xmath48-exhaustive extremal coarse - graining for the paths in @xmath229 is a coarse - graining @xmath230 seeded in the extremal paths @xmath231 between @xmath212 and @xmath4 .",
    "where each @xmath232 is given by , with elements @xmath222 given by and radii given by @xmath233 in .",
    "this definition works when the lengths of the extremal paths , @xmath234<<\\epsilon$ ] , otherwise there is usually no such @xmath200 . if @xmath235 the coarse - graining can not be exhaustive to the given order ( @xmath48 ) without self - intersection",
    ". see figure 1 for an illustration of extremal coarse - grainings .",
    "heuristically , the width of the coarse grainings around an extremal path should be wide enough so that the total amplitude is approximated to the order of some formal parameter @xmath48 ( usually taken to be @xmath236 ) . for @xmath237 the amplitude",
    "is carried by a tight bundle of paths around each classical path , not posing a tight constraint on the width of the coarse - graining .",
    "records are then defined as :    [ def : full_record ] given an initial configuration @xmath212 , @xmath4 and @xmath238 the @xmath48-extremal coarse graining ( def .",
    "[ def : ecs ] ) between @xmath202 and @xmath4 , of radii @xmath239 given in , we will say @xmath4 holds a ( single - segmented ) semi - classical record of a field configuration @xmath116 to order @xmath48 , if @xmath116 is contained in every @xmath216 .",
