    "if a random walking process is running on the solution space starting from an initial solution , a two - step relaxation behavior can be observed @xcite , corresponding to a quick slipping into a solution community , a relatively long wandering within this community , and finally the viscous diffusing in the whole solution space .",
    "similar two - step relaxation behaviors were observed in glassy dynamics studies of supercooled liquids ( see , e.g. , the review article @xcite ) both in the non - activated dynamics region and in the activated dynamics region .",
    "the existence of solution communities in the solution space may lead to a phenomenon that is similar to the dynamical heterogeneity of supercooled liquids ( see , e.g. , review articles @xcite ) . for a random walking process on a heterogeneous solution space ,",
    "if the observation time is less than the typical relaxation time of escaping from the solution communities , one may find that the spin values of a large fraction of variables change only very infrequently among the visited solutions , while the spin values of the remaining variables are flipped much more frequently .",
    "the variables of the @xmath0-sat formula then divides into an active group and an inactive group in this observation time window .",
    "one may further observe that the active variables are clustered into many distantly separated sub - groups , each of which containing variables that are very close to each other @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations need to be performed to investigate in more detail the solution space random walking processes .",
    "the constraint density @xmath1 of the random @xmath0-sat problem corresponds to the particle density @xmath166 in supercooled liquid . in supercooled liquids ,",
    "another important control parameter is the temperature @xmath29 .",
    "we can also introduce a positive temperature @xmath29 to the random @xmath0-sat problem and investigate how the configuration space evolves with @xmath29 .",
    "it is anticipated that , as @xmath29 is lowered to a threshold value @xmath167 the configuration space will also experience a heterogeneity transition @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical and simulation results will be reported in a later work .",
    "for the fully - connected @xmath28-spin spherical model of glasses , it has already been shown @xcite that a quantity called the franz - parisi potential has a change in its concavity property as @xmath29 is lowered ( see @xcite for more recent extended studies ) .",
    "another related problem , the weight space property of the ising perceptron , was studied in @xcite . for this fully connected model ,",
    "a change of concavity property was also predicted for its characteristic function .",
    "the solution space heterogeneity transition also exists in the random @xmath0-xorsat problem @xcite",
