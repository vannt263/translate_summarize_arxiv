    "in the @xmath1cdm cosmological scenario about 80@xmath2 of the matter of the universe is believed to be composed of non - baryonic matter , called dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the most popular dm candidates are the wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) supposed to be cold , electrically neutral , stable , and massive  @xcite . among the huge plethora of wimp candidates , the best motivated ones are related to the supersymmetrical ( susy ) and extra dimensional extensions of the standard model of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "+ in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , the neutralino @xmath3 represents an excellent cold dm candidate with a relic density compatible with the wmap bounds .",
    "since the neutralino is a majorana particle , pairs of @xmath3 can annihilate into standard model particles , e.g. , quarks , leptons , and w bosons .",
    "the subsequent hadronization of those particles results in a continuum emission of gamma - rays characterized by a cut - off at the neutralino mass and by possible spectral features like bumps or a hardening of the spectral slope .",
    "+ the expected gamma - ray flux from dm - annihilating astrophysical objects , as function of the energy threshold @xmath4 and the integration region @xmath5 , within which the signal is integrated , can be factorized in two terms : @xmath6 the so - called particle physics factor @xmath7 depends on the features of the dm particle , and can be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity averaged annihilation cross - section , and @xmath10 is the particular branching ratio for the @xmath11-th annihilation channel .",
    "+ the term j@xmath12 ( the so - called astrophysical factor ) is given by the line  of  sight integral over the dm density squared within a solid angle @xmath5 , and depends on the density profile of the dm halo of the source : @xmath13 + since the gamma - ray flux of dm annihilation is proportional to the square of the dm density , only sources with high expected dm densities are good targets for dm indirect searches . among these , the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsphs ) of the milky way ( mw ) are interesting objects thanks to their relative proximity to the earth , to their high mass  to  light ratio ( with values within tens and thousands of m@xmath14/l@xmath14 ) and to the expected absence of conventional gamma - ray sources within the system  @xcite .",
    "so far , around two dozen dsphs have been identified .",
    "segue  1 , discovered in 2006 by the sdss  @xcite , is located at 28  kpc from the galactic center , at ( ra , dec)=(10.12@xmath15 , 16.08@xmath16 ) .",
    "kinematics studies applied to 66 member stars allowed to estimate its mass  to  light ratio to be in the range 1320 - 3400 m@xmath14/l@xmath14  @xcite , highlighting segue  1 as the most dm dominated dsph known so far .",
    "+ the magic - i telescope is a 17  m dish imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) , located at the roque de los muchachos observatory , in the canary island of la palma ( 2200 m a.s.l . ) .",
    "thanks to its low energy threshold ( @xmath1760  gev at zenith ) , high flux sensitivity ( @xmath18 of the crab nebula flux in 50  hour of observations above @xmath17250  gev ) , and good angular and energy resolution ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , at @xmath0  gev )  @xcite , magic - i is a suited instrument for the indirect search for dm candidates with energy of the neutralino mass or the kaluza - klein state .",
    "a search for a possible dm gamma - ray signal coming from segue  1 was performed by the magic - i telescope between november 2008 and march 2009 , for a total of 29.4  hours of observation time ( after data selection ) .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the standard magic - i analysis and reconstruction software  @xcite .",
    "the number of gamma - ray candidates events from the direction of the source was estimated using the distribution of @xmath21 angles , which are related to the orientation of the showers .",
    "the overall analysis cuts were optimized and cross - checked for point - like sources with the aid of contemporaneous crab nebula data . in figure",
    "[ alphaplot ] , the @xmath21-plot above @xmath0  gev is shown .",
    "the number of excess events was computed in a fixed fiducial signal region with @xmath22 and resulted to be @xmath23 , corresponding to a significance of @xmath24 , computed using eq.(17 ) of li@xmath25ma  @xcite .",

    "red points represent the signal ( on distribution ) , black points the background ( off distribution ) , and green points their difference .",
    "the vertical dashed line at @xmath26 is the fiducial region below which the excess event number is estimated .",
    "image taken from  @xcite.,width=264 ]    since results were consistent with no signal over the background , we derived upper limits ( uls ) on the flux , calculated using the rolke method  @xcite at @xmath27 confidence level , and assuming a @xmath20 systematic uncertainty . figure  [ intul ] shows the integral uls achieved by the magic - i observation of segue  1 considering different energy thresholds @xmath28 and different power - law spectra with spectral index @xmath29 .     is assumed . image taken from  @xcite.,width=264 ]    it is worth noting that , using the rolke method , the uls on the number of the excess events , and consequently the integral flux uls , are affected by statistical fluctuations quantified by the significance of the observation @xmath30 .",
    "this is an intrinsic feature of the statistical method exploited in the analysis and it should be taken into account when comparing uls from different analyses . to show this effect , in figure  [ intul ] we plot also the uls ( dashed lines ) computed assuming a value for @xmath30 equal to zero ( with number of on events equal to the number of off events in the signal region of @xmath21-plot ) for different values of spectral index and energy threshold .",
    "assuming a particular form for segue  1 dm halo , and a given particle model for the dm candidates , we can translate the integral uls derived from the segue  1 observation into constraints on the dm annihilation rate . + motivated by results from cosmological simulation , the dm halo around segue  1",
    "was modeled by using the einasto radial profile  @xcite with @xmath311.1@xmath3210@xmath33  m@xmath14  kpc@xmath34 , r@xmath35=0.15  kpc , and n=3.3 . with those parameters , the total astrophysical factor of segue  1 results to be @xmath3610@xmath37  gev@xmath38  @xmath39  sr .",
    "since the analysis was performed assuming point - like source cuts ( corresponding to an angular integration of 0.14@xmath40 above @xmath0  gev ) , we estimated the effective astrophysical factor within the analysis cuts to be used in the following analysis , being its value @xmath4110@xmath37  gev@xmath38  @xmath39  sr ( corresponding to the 64@xmath2 of the total astrophysical factor ) .",
    "+ concerning the particle physics , we restricted ourselves to the case of a susy model in which the presence of a discrete symmetry ( r  parity ) guarantees that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable over cosmological timescales and , therefore , a good dm candidate .",
    "we considered a 5-dimensional subspace of the mssm called msugra  @xcite , for which the basic parameters are the universal masses of the gauginos ( @xmath42 ) and scalars ( @xmath43 ) , the trilinear coupling ( @xmath44 ) , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs fields ( tan@xmath45 ) and the sign of the higgsino mass term ( sign@xmath46 ) . in order to study the phenomenology of msugra we performed a grid scan over the parameter space , for a total of 5@xmath3210@xmath47 points ( for the details",

    "i ) _ where the lightest susy particle is a neutralino , _ ii ) _ that survive the standard model constraints and _ iii ) _ with a relic density compatible with the value derived by wmap data within three times its experimental error @xmath48  @xcite . for each dm model of the scan",
    ", we computed the integral flux ul ( above an energy threshold e@xmath49 ) , using the segue  1 data and the specific gamma - ray spectrum derived from the individual dm model .",
    "since the spectra for each dm model have different shapes and cut - offs , the value of the optimal energy threshold e@xmath49 was computed individually for each dm mass .",
    "we then converted the flux uls into uls on the velocity averaged cross - section to have a direct comparison of experimental data with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ dm_uls ] as function of the neutralino mass : each dm model of the scan ( full circle ) is compared to its own ul ( square ) .",
    "for each point we defined an enhancement factor ( enf ) as the ratio between the ul on the velocity averaged cross - section and the value predicted by msugra .",
    "this quantity quantifies how far away we are from excluding some portions of the msugra parameters space . from figure  [ dm_uls ]",
    "it can be seen that enfs for model compatible with the wmap bounds are typically above 10@xmath50 , while typical values are of the order of @xmath51 .     from wmap bounds . for each of these full circles",
    "the ul on the cross - section can be computed from the segue 1 data ( after energy threshold optimization ) and it is indicated here by a square .",
    "circles and squared are colored in term of the enhancement factor .",
    "image taken from  @xcite.,width=264 ]",
    "we tested our uls on some of the models proposed in the literature that can explain the pamela data  @xcite for the energy spectrum of the positron fraction @xmath52 as due to dm annihilation into leptons .",
    "the regions in the @xmath53 plane that provide a good fit to the pamela measurements  @xcite for three different channels of dm annihilation are shown in figure  [ pamela_uls ] .",
    "the annihilation channels @xmath54 , @xmath55 have been taken from supersymmetry , while for @xmath56 the existence of a new dark force , mediated by the carrier @xmath57 that decays into leptons  @xcite , has been assumed . in figure",
    "[ pamela_uls ] we plot the uls obtained from the segue  1 data , using again the specific dm annihilation spectra .",
    "we can see that , in this case , the enfs needed to meet the pamela - favoured region are much smaller than those found for msugra , and in the case of annihilation into @xmath58 our uls are probing the relevant regions . however , it is worth mentioning that , since the uncertainty in the segue  1 astrophysical factor is quite large @xcite , an improvement in accuracy of astrophysical factor value could be able to put more stringent constrains and to confirm the exclusion of the pamela region for dm particle annihilating in @xmath58 .",
    "( green lines ) or @xmath58 ( blue line ) , and for a dm candidate interacting with a light intermediate state @xmath57 decaying into a pair of electrons ( pink line ) . the same annihilation channels ( with the same color coding )",
    "are considered to draw the regions in the plane that provide a good fit to the pamela measurement of the energy spectrum of the positron fraction .",
    "image taken from  @xcite.,width=264 ]",
    "a search for a possible dm gamma - ray signal coming from segue  1 was performed by the magic - i telescope .",
    "no hints of signal were found above the background for energies larger than @xmath0  gev .",
    "integral uls on the gamma - ray emission were computed assuming different power - law energy spectra . within the msugra scenario , a large scan of neutralino models",
    "was performed over the parameter space .",
    "subsequently for each simulated dm model , the uls on the velocity averaged annihilation cross - section @xmath59 were derived separately for each point in the scan in order to account for the dependence on the specific spectra .",
    "results indicate that a general exclusion plot can not be drawn to constrain the parameter space , so we provide the results in terms of enhancement factors .",
    "a minimum boost on the flux is found of the order of 10@xmath60 ( for models compatible with wmap ) while the typical values are at 10@xmath61 .",
    "magic - i data of segue  1 can be useful to put constraints on those dm models that are provided in the literature to explain the pamela data .",
    "our uls are probing the pamela region for the dm models annihilating into @xmath58 but the robustness of this result could be improved , decreasing the uncertainty in the astrophysical factor . +",
    "although the magic - i observation did not result in a detection , and the uls require still high flux enhancement factors to actually match the experiment sensitivity , an analysis like the one presented here is able to point out details and features that can be important for future deep exposures of this or similar objects , with next - generation cherenkov experiments .",
