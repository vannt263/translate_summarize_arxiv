    "in classical mechanics , usually , we formulate and solve the equations of motion of a system for certain initial conditions . in every framework , newtonian , lagrangian or hamiltonian , the ultimate goal is to develop our understanding of the system through such solutions , which may be analytical or numerical , or a combination of both .",
    "thus , the focus is on the behaviour of a _ single _ trajectory beginning from a given initial condition .",
    "no attempt is made to study the collective behaviour of a family of trajectories .",
    "we believe that such a study provides a new perspective towards qualitatively understanding the configuration space of a dynamical system .",
    "based on the above observation , in our work here , we frame a somewhat different question as follows : how do we understand the behaviour of a properly defined family of trajectories ?",
    "one way of defining a family of trajectories is to vary the initial conditions on position and velocity around specific values .",
    "the family of trajectories thus obtained may be treated as flow - lines in the configuration space of the system .",
    "the evolution kinematics of the family may then be studied using the set - up discussed here .",
    "there are , surely , various ways of perturbing initial conditions . here",
    ", we prescribe specific initial conditions on certain kinematic variables ( that we define ) which are solely associated with the family .",
    "we analyse how the family evolves as a whole .",
    "for example , one may ask do the trajectories in the family diverge , or converge and intersect after some finite time ?",
    "if not , is there a relative shearing or a twist of the area enclosing a family of trajectories , or do they remain parallel ? through answers to such questions , we hope to gain some new insights on the behaviour of a given system .",
    "it is natural to ask how useful is it to study such a question . are there any real scenarios where such an analysis is relevant ?",
    "is there any new formalism which can be analysed and developed ?",
    "the answer to both the queries is yes . for example , imagine two pendula , suspended from the same point but set to oscillate with differing initial positions and velocities .",
    "one may ask when will they strike each other ? the situation arises , for example , in the ringing of the old - fashioned bell in temples and churches .",
    "another system where the above questions seem relevant is projectile motion when and how do a bunch of projectiles fired with differing positions and velocities strike each other ?",
    "how do the specification of initial conditions affect the evolution of the family of projectile trajectories ?",
    "studies of nonlinear dynamical systems are replete with examples where the meeting / divergence of trajectories beginning from two infinitesimally separated initial conditions is of interest .",
    "it is also likely that in some situations , it may be crucial to know those conditions which ensure that a family of trajectories never meet i.e. , they always tend to repel each other .",
    "we avoid complicated systems in this work and discuss well - known , simple examples involving mechanical systems .",
    "the main aim here is to illustrate the general formalism .",
    "the notional study on the meeting of trajectories is not new .",
    "it has a different name and meaning in the context of riemannian geometry and general relativity .",
    "it is called _ geodesic focusing _ and the equations governing the focusing behaviour are known as the _ raychaudhuri equations _",
    "its usefulness and importance in studies related to gravitation and singularities is well - known to all @xcite .",
    "the raychaudhuri equations have also been used and analysed in the kinematics of deformable media @xcite and in the kinematic study of geodesic congruences in various spacetime backgrounds @xcite .",
    "however their applicability in simple mechanical systems has never been looked at . it is our hope that through the formalism and examples developed here , one will be able to gain useful insight into the geometrical behaviour of trajectories in mechanical systems .    in the next section ( section [ sec : one_dimension ] )",
    ", we develop the formalism in one dimension and illustrate it through some simple examples .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec : two_dimension ] , we extend the formalism to two dimensions and provide another set of examples all in two dimensions . in section [ sec :",
    "connection ] , we briefly elaborate on the links with riemannian geometry and relativity .",
    "the last section ( section [ sec : conclusion ] ) summarises our results and proposes some questions for the future .",
    "to get started , let us consider a simple system comprising a particle of unit mass in a potential field @xmath0 in one space dimension .",
    "the lagrangian of the system is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the velocity .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath3 let us now consider a family of trajectories defined by perturbing the initial conditions .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath4 which expresses the gradient of @xmath5 between two infinitesimally separated trajectories of the family .",
    "writing @xmath6 , we have @xmath7 where we have used the equation of motion ( [ eqm1 ] ) .",
    "thus , given the potential function , we can obtain the equation for @xmath8 .",
    "however , in some situations , we may not know the lagrangian or the potential function , but know only the equation of motion",
    ". examples of such systems are those with non - potential / non - conservative force fields ( say , with damping ) . in such cases , one writes @xmath9 where @xmath10 includes all the forces ( per unit mass ) involved , including damping .",
    "we then have @xmath11 as our equation for @xmath8 .",
    "we shall discuss examples of both types in the next section .",
    "a further important point is the notion of meeting of trajectories in finite time .",
    "let us assume a general solution for @xmath12 which depends on two initial values @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "in order to obtain a neighbouring trajectory , one displaces @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "let us call the new trajectory as @xmath19 . at some @xmath20",
    "if the two trajectories meet , then @xmath21 , from which one would get the initial value of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath22 , required for the trajectories to meet .",
    "alternatively , if we assume @xmath23 we know @xmath24 without knowing or solving the equation for @xmath25 . however , the solution for the differential equation for @xmath8 will also yield the same relation between the initial @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it may also happen that the trajectories do not meet at all , in which case , a real finite value of @xmath24 does not exist .    in one dimension ,",
    "one notices that @xmath8 represents the fractional rate of change in separation @xmath26 between two trajectories .",
    "therefore , at any time @xmath27 , one can write the separation @xmath28 as @xmath29 it is clear that the ( exponential ) divergence / convergence of the family is intimately connected with the scalar @xmath8 . therefore , in one dimension , one realises that @xmath8 is the well - known lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath30 in finite time implies @xmath31 in finite time this is termed as focusing ( defocussing ) of a family / congruence of trajectories in riemannian geometry and relativity .",
    "it may be noted that , at our present level of understanding , the identification of @xmath8 with the lyapunov exponent is only notional .",
    "it is not from the perspective of chaotic motion , which has to do with the behaviour of two trajectories starting out from two slightly different initial conditions ( i.e. , sensitive dependence on initial conditions ) .",
    "the equation of motion for the simple harmonic oscillator or the simple pendulum is generically written as : @xmath32 where , @xmath33 is the frequency of oscillation .",
    "the solution of this equation is given by @xmath34 and , consequently , @xmath35 where , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are , respectively , the values of @xmath12 , @xmath36 at @xmath15 . in order to get a feel of the physical picture ,",
    "let us consider three simple pendula , hung from the same point .",
    "we take @xmath12 as the angle variable for the pendula , with initial positions @xmath37 , @xmath13 and @xmath38 and initial velocities @xmath39 , @xmath14 and @xmath40 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the values of the initial position and initial velocity of the central pendulum . the three pendula will strike each other when the separation between them becomes zero , i.e. when @xmath41 this condition may be recast as @xmath42 where we have defined @xmath43 . note that @xmath24 depends on @xmath33 and , more importantly , on @xmath23 .",
    "as stated earlier , this result must also emerge from the solution of the differential equation for @xmath25 , which , in this example is , @xmath44 the solution of the above equation is , @xmath45 it is easy to note from ( [ eq : simpleharmonic5 ] ) that @xmath46 as @xmath47 which obviously indicates that the family of trajectories intersect in finite time .",

    "thus it follows that the focusing time @xmath24 is the same as that given in ( [ eq : emfield_focusing_time ] ) .",
    "further , it may be noted that , nowhere in the solutions for the esr variables , the electric field appears whereas the magnetic field appears through @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the esr variables with and without electric field are the same ; the electric field only affects the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath279 for simplicity . unlike in the previous examples in two dimensions , in this case ,",
    "the rotation is not identically zero even though the initial rotation is set to zero .",
    "this happens because of the presence of the magnetic field through the parameter @xmath33 .    the evolution of a congruence of four particles starting from the four corners of a square , for different initial expansion , rotation and shear are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emfield1]-[fig : emfield3 ] .",
    "once again the results shown in the figures demonstrate the role of expansion , shear and rotation through the evolution of the shape of the area enclosing the four trajectories . in this case , the nature of the evolution of the square is the same as that in the two dimensional oscillator case .",
    "as mentioned in section [ approach ] , the equations for the expansion , shear and rotation which we have been dealing with are similar to the well - known raychaudhuri equations for geodesic congruences in a riemannian or semi - riemannian spacetime .",
    "if @xmath105 is the velocity vector associated with the geodesic congruence , we can write down the following equation @xmath280 @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the riemann curvature tensor . on a riemannian or semi - riemannian spacetime",
    ", the term @xmath283 gives the geodesic equation for affinely parameterized geodesics .",
    "however , for non - affinely parameterized geodesics or , say in newtonian gravity , this term gives the force , i.e. , acceleration of the particle , and hence is not equal to zero .",
    "expressing the gradient of the velocity field , which is a second rank tensor , as a sum of its trace , symmetric traceless and antisymmetric parts ( which essentially correspond to the expansion , shear and rotation mentioned before ) we can obtain individual equations for these kinematic quantities .",
    "the resulting equations are known as the raychaudhuri equations .",
    "more details on these equations are available in @xcite .",
    "we shall not discuss them any further here .",
    "we have discussed the kinematics of a family of configuration space flow - lines of mechanical systems in one and two dimensions .",
    "the kinematics has been quantified through the expansion , shear and rotation of a set of non - interacting particles set upon trajectories started from perturbed initial conditions and visualized in the configuration space of the system .",
    "this sheds some light on the general behaviour of mechanical systems in terms of the configuration space geometry .    in more quantitative terms ,",
    "the formalism presented here can distinctly answer the following three questions for any given system .",
    "@xmath284 is there a finite non - zero time at which a given set of trajectories ( for a particular physical system ) with specified initial conditions , will meet ? is it possible to derive the conditions under which they will never meet ?",
    "@xmath284 what is the role of initial conditions on the behaviour of a given family of trajectories ?    @xmath284 how does one develop a frame - by - frame ( in time ) picture of the evolution of the family of trajectories ? what are specific quantifiers of this evolution in time",
    "?    it will surely be worthwhile to study various mechanical systems in diverse dimensions ( especially in three dimensions ) in order to illustrate the formalism further and also to gain a better understanding .    in general relativity ,",
    "the expansion @xmath8 is known to diverge to minus infinity ( focusing ) at a curvature singularity . however , focusing can also occur in a benign way with the focal point not being a curvature singularity but just a singularity of the congreunce .",
    "it is known that such congruence singularities do occur in optics ( known as caustics ) . for the classical mechanical systems discussed here ,",
    "focusing implies the meeting of trajectories",
    ". it may be useful to know whether the focusing of trajectories in mechanical systems can , in some situations , correspond to singularities in the geometry of configuration space or , alternatively , have an interpretation similar to the caustics in optics .    the approach advocated in this work is on the threshold of an immediate extension for investigating general dynamical systems which are extensively used as phenomenological models in a variety of areas in science and engineering .",
    "this sector is complex , largely unstructured , but affords exciting possibilities .",
    "the appearance of different flow structures and their transition in turbulent fluid flows may be analysed using the proposed formalism .",
    "focusing of a family of trajectories have important manifestations in , for example , shock formation in fluid and solid mechanics , gravitational collapse in astrophysics and cosmology etc .. in the theory of dynamical systems , the issue of ( non - metric ) curvature of the underlying space and its meaning may be an interesting possibility to look into .",
    "looking ahead , the deeper question of integrability of dynamical systems may be associated with the evolution kinematics of the family of trajectories in the phase space @xcite .",
    "it is known that if all flow - lines can be extended indefinitely ( globally parallel flow ) , it provides a natural , globally cartesian coordinate system implying integrability in the sense of lie . on the other hand , occurrence of a singularity in the evolution of the family of trajectories implies an underlying effectively curved manifold which , in general , prevents integrability .",
    "the approach presented here , appropriately extended , may be able to provide some clue in this direction in future .",
