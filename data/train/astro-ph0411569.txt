    "the idea that the light and fragile elements li , be and b are produced by the interaction of the energetic nuclei of galactic cosmic rays ( cgr ) with the nuclei of the interstellar medium ( ism ) was introduced 35 years ago ( reeves et al .",
    "1970 , meneguzzi et al . 1971 ) . in those early works",
    "it was shown that , taking into account the relevant cross - sections and with plausible assumptions about the gcr properties ( injected and propagated spectra , intensities etc . ; see fig . 1 , _",
    "right column _ ) one may reproduce reasonably well the abundances of those light elements observed in meteorites _ and _ in gcr .",
    "two problems were identified with the gcr production , compared to meteoritic composition : the @xmath2li/@xmath1li ratio ( @xmath02 in gcr but @xmath012 in meteorites ) and the @xmath3b/@xmath4b ratio ( @xmath02.5 in gcr but @xmath04 in meteorites ) .",
    "modern solutions to those problems involve _ stellar _ production of @xmath070% of @xmath2li ( in the hot envelopes of agb stars and/or novae ) and of @xmath040% of @xmath3b ( through @xmath5-induced spallation of @xmath6c in snii ) . in both cases , however , uncertainties in the yields are such that observations are used to constrain the yields of the candidate sources rather than to confirm the validity of the scenario .",
    "one of the major cosmological developments of the 1980s was the discovery of the li plateau in low metallicity halo stars ( spite and spite 1982 , see fig . 1 _",
    "the unique behaviour of that element , i.e. the constancy of the li / h ratio with metallicity , strongly suggests a primordial origin .",
    "the observed value has been extensively used ( along with those of d and @xmath7he ) to constrain the physics of primordial nucleosynthesis and , in particular , the baryonic density of the universe ( e;g .",
    "steigman , this meeting ) .",
    "in particular , the difference between the observed plateau value ( ryan et al .",
    "1999 ) and the li abundance corresponding to the baryonic density derived from wmap data ( fig .",
    "1 ) is rather high ( @xmath00.5 dex ) and points to a failure of our understanding , of either stellar atmospheres , primordial nucleosynthesis or li depletion in stars ( e.g. lambert 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "observations of halo stars in the 90s revealed a linear relationship between be / h ( as well as b / h ) and fe / h . that was unexpected , since be and b were thought to be produced as _ secondaries _ , by spallation of the increasingly abundant cno nuclei .",
    "only the li isotopes , produced at low metallicities mostly by @xmath8 fusion reactions ( steigman and walker 1992 ) are produced as primaries . the only way to produce primary be and b is by assuming that gcr have always the same cno content ( duncan et al .",
    "the most convincing argument in that respect is the `` energetics argument '' put forward by ramaty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : if sn are the main source of gcr energy , there is a limit to the amount of light elements produced per sn , which depends on gcr and ism composition .",
    "if the metal content of both ism and gcr becomes low , there is simply not enough energy in gcr to keep the be and b yields constant ( as required by observations ) .",
    "since the ism metallicity certainly increases with time , the only possibility to have @xmath0constant libeb yields is by assuming that gcr have a @xmath0constant metallicity .",
    "a @xmath0constant abundance of c and o in gcr can naturally be understood if sn accelerate their own ejecta .",
    "however , the absence of unstable @xmath9ni ( decaying through e@xmath10-capture within 10@xmath11 yr ) from observed gcr suggests that acceleration occurs @xmath1210@xmath11 yr after the explosion ( wiedenbeck et al .",
    "1999 ) when sn ejecta are presumably diluted in the ism .",
    "higdon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that gcr are accelerated in _",
    "superbubbles _ ( sb ) , enriched by the ejecta of many sn as to have a large and @xmath0constant metallicity . since then , this became _ by default _",
    ", the `` standard '' scenario for the production of primary be and b by gcr , invoked in almost every work on that topic .",
    "however , the sb scenario suffers from ( at least ) two problems .",
    "first , core collapse sn are observationally associated to hii regions ( van dyk et al .",
    "1996 ) and it is well known that the metallicity of hii regions reflects the one of the _ ambient ism _",
    "( i.e. it can be very low , as in izw18 ) rather than the one of sn . moreover , higdon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) evaluated the time interval @xmath13 between sn explosions in a sb to a comfortable @xmath143 10@xmath11 yr , leaving enough time to @xmath9ni to decay before the next sn explosion and subsequent acceleration .",
    "however , sb are constantly powered not only by sn but also by the strong _ winds of massive stars _ ( with integrated energy and acceleration efficiency similar to the sn one , e.g. parizot et al .",
    "2004 ) , which should continuously accelerate @xmath9ni , as soon as it is ejected from sn explosions .",
    "thus , sb suffer exactly from the same problem that plagued sn as accelerators of metal rich ejecta .",
    "the problem of the acceleration site of gcr ( so crucial for the observed linearity of be and b vs fe ) has not found a satisfactory explanation yet .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the recent report of a `` plateau '' for @xmath1li / h in halo stars ( asplund et al .",
    "this meeting ) gives a new twist to the libeb saga .",
    "the detected @xmath1li / h ( and corresponding @xmath2li/@xmath1li ) value at [ fe / h]=-2.8 is much larger than expected if gcr are the only source of the observed be / h and @xmath1li / h in that star ( see fig .",
    "a few explanations have been proposed for such a high early amount of @xmath1li :    \\1 ) primordial , non - standard , production during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) : the decay / annihilation of some massive particle ( e.g. neutralino ) releases energetic nucleons / photons which produce @xmath15he or @xmath15h by spallation / photodisinte- gration of @xmath7he , while subsequent fusion reactions between @xmath7he and @xmath15he or @xmath15h create @xmath1li ( e.g. jedamzik 2004 ) .",
    "observations of @xmath1li / h constrain then the masses / cross - sections / densities of the massive particle .",
    "\\2 ) pre - galactic , by fusion reactions of @xmath7he nuclei , accelerated by the energy released during structure formation ( suzuki and inoue 2002 ) ; in that case , cr energetics are decoupled from sn energetics . in view of the many uncertainties related to the behaviour of the baryonic component during structure formation , the energetics of cr in that scenario are very poorly known / constrained at present - rays ( from decaying pions , produced py energetic @xmath16 reactions ) could contribute significantly to the extragalactic @xmath17-ray background ; see also prantzos and cass ( 1994 ) . ] .",
    "moreover , in order to explain the observed @xmath1li `` plateau '' the effect must end ( or drastically decrease ) _ before _ the first stars form and explode releasing fe , otherwise @xmath1li / h would continue increasing at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath12 - 3 . but this runs against our current understanding of structure formation , which suggests that merging of sub - structures continues with mildly reduced intensity during a large fraction of the galaxy s early life ( e.g. helmi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "\\3 ) a third possibility is suggested by the observed @xmath0constancy of @xmath1li / he and be / c with [ fe / h ] ( fig .",
    "3 _ right top _ ) , reminiscent of an _ equilibrium _ process . indeed , the abundances of the libeb isotopes _ in gcr _ are much higher than the solar ones ( _ right bottom _ ) and are in equilibrium with those of the progenitor he , c , n , o nuclei , i.e. the ratio of daughter / progenitor abundances in gcr is roughly equal to the one of the corresponding production / destruction spallation cross - sections .",
    "the advantage of that idea is that it explains at one stroke both the primary be and b ( always at equilibrium with progenitor cno nuclei ) and the @xmath1li plateau ( with @xmath1li at equilibrium with progenitor @xmath7he ) .",
    "however , equilibrium requires very fast production and destruction reactions ( with timescales shorter than the evolutionary timescale of the system ) ; this certainly happens inside gcr ( with the fast gcr particles interacting with the numerous ism nuclei ) but the opposite does not hold(n @xmath18)@xmath19 . for gcr @xmath1li interacting with ism protons of density @xmath201",
    "@xmath21 one has @xmath2210@xmath2 yr , but for ism @xmath1li interacting with gcr protons of @xmath2010@xmath23 @xmath21 ( corresponding to the observed energy density of 1 ev / cm@xmath15 ) @xmath25 is a billion times larger ( @xmath26400 mb being the destruction cross - section ) . ] .",
