    "detailed studies of the structure of radio pulsar pulse profiles are essential for understanding the pulsar emission mechanism and the forms of the pulsar emission beam .",
    "pulse profiles are remarkably stable over timescales ranging from a few pulses to many years , indicating that these profiles are determined by permanent physical characteristics of the neutron star and its environment .",
    "many profile properties can be explained very well by the `` hollow - cone '' model of pulsar emission developed by radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) and komesaroff ( 1970 ) , shortly after the discovery of the first pulsar .",
    "this `` magnetic - pole '' model , further developed by sturrock ( 1971 ) and ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) , involves charges streaming from the polar cap along the open field lines , radiating in the direction of their motion and forming an emission cone aligned with the magnetic axis of the star .",
    "as more pulsars were discovered , many were found to have two , three or even more pulse components , prompting various efforts to classify and interpret the various forms ( .",
    "backer 1973 ; rankin 1983 , 1993 ; lyne & manchester 1988 ) .    in this paper we draw attention to the strange `` notches '' in the profiles of b0950 + 08 and two other pulsars , j04374715 and b1929 + 10 . all three stars exhibit very similar double ",
    "notch \" features which appear to have virtually nothing to do with the component structures of their very different profiles .",
    "b0950 + 08 and b1929 + 10 have rotational periods of 253 and 227 ms , whereas j04374715 is a binary millisecond pulsar with a period of only 5.75 ms .",
    "significantly , these stars are some of the very closest among the pulsar population  all with dispersion measures ( dms ) of about 3  pc @xmath1 and parallax - determined distances of some 262@xmath25 , 331@xmath210 and 170@xmath23 pc ( brisken  2000 , 2002)and , in spite of the fact that they all have rather ordinary spindown values , all have been detected in the optical and/or soft x - ray region ( mignani   2002 ; de luca  2003 ; wang  1997 ; zavlin  2002 ) .",
    "b0950 + 08 and b1929 + 10 are among the brightest pulsars in the radio sky@xcite , and j04374715 is well known as the brightest millisecond pulsar . in  [ sec : obsres ] we discuss our observations of b0950 + 08 , present its average pulse profiles and describe the unusual features . in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we compare these features with similar ones seen in the profiles of j0437@xmath04715 and b1929 + 10 and discuss possible physical interpretations .",
    "observations presented in this section were made using the 305-m arecibo telescope in puerto rico .",
    "observations at 430  mhz were obtained using the arecibo observatory fourier transform machine ( aoftm ) with 1024 channels across a 10-mhz bandpass and with 409.6-@xmath3s sampling .",
    "b0950 + 08 was observed at 430  mhz on mjds 51182 , 51188 and 51189 ( 4th , 10th and 11th of january , 1999 ) for durations of 3000 , 3700 and 2500  seconds , respectively .",
    "the 1475-mhz data presented were acquired with the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) with 128 channels across a 100-mhz bandpass and 256-@xmath3s sampling .",
    "observations of b0950 + 08 at this frequency were taken on mjds 52187 and 52189 ( 5th and 7th of october , 2001 ) for durations of 1100 and 7200 seconds , respectively .",
    "for each b0950 + 08 observation , pulse phases were calculated using the software package tempo @xcite and an ephemeris obtained at jodrell bank observatory @xcite .",
    "data were folded to create mean pulse profiles . the up - to - date ephemeris allowed alignment of the profiles acquired on different dates and at different frequencies .",
    "the 430-mhz average profiles for the mjd  51188 and 51189 observations are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:0950.51188 ] and [ fig:0950.51189 ] .",
    "note that the two profiles are distinctly different in overall form , but that the low - level features are seen at just the same @xmath4 longitude before the main pulse ( mp ) peak ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:0950.51188.2 ] & [ fig:0950.51189.2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , a similar pair of features is seen in the mjd  51182 data ( not shown ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:0950.52189 ] we present a corresponding 1475-mhz profile for the mjd  52189 observation , where again a low - level feature is seen at some @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ fig:0950.52189.2 ] ) . at 430  mhz",
    "the feature consists of two dips in the profile intensity with half widths of some 2@xmath5 and their centers separated by some @xmath6 .",
    "the total width of the feature at 430  mhz is @xmath7 . at 1475  mhz  in both this observation and another ( not shown ) on mjd 52187the feature appears as a single peak with a width of @xmath8 .",
    "several published observations also appear to record the b0950 + 08 `` notches '' .",
    "they are very clear in the 430-mhz time - aligned profile of hankins & rankin ( 2003 ) , but can not be discerned in the lower quality observations at various other frequencies .",
    "moreover , the `` notches '' can probably be seen in the polarimetric observations of both gould & lyne ( 1998 ) and weisberg  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the former very high quality profiles seem to show pairs of features at the correct phase at 408 , 610 and 925 mhz , and in the latter we appear to see a _",
    "pair _ of features at 1418 mhz .",
    "this latter observation ( see their fig .  5 ) is especially interesting because the features appear to involve the linear polarization also , which is only 2030% in the region on the far leading edge of the profile .",
    "it must be said that the features in b0950 + 08 are rather weak , at best reducing the intensity at their centers by a few percent .",
    "it might even be regarded as surprising that such features would be found in a star which is well known for its sporadic emission ( it may not be known , for instance , whether the pulsar ever nulls , because the range of intensities exhibited by its pulses is so large . ) in this context , it is interesting that nowakowski  ( 2003 ) have shown that this pulsar s profile is comprised of different intensity fractions which have quite different partial - average profile forms .",
    "these studies indicate that the mp has three main `` components '' : the trailing one which is usually strongest , the middle one which varies in relative intensity , and a leading one which can only be discerned in certain populations of weak pulses .",
    "it would therefore appear that the distinct 430-mhz profiles seen above represent distinct profile `` modes '' in this star .",
    "finally , the above study finds that the `` notches '' are seen only in the very weakest populations of pulses , which nonetheless contribute significant power to the profile .",
    "the authors believe that the weakest pulses represent emission from rather higher altitudes than the stronger fractions .",
    "unusual features similar to those presented in ",
    "[ sec : obsres ] have been observed in two other pulsars .",
    "rankin & rathnasree ( 1997 ) reported a double notch - like feature in the average profile of b1929 + 10 at 430  mhz , and a display similar to theirs using the same observations is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1929 ] .",
    "as can be seen there , the `` notches '' follow the main pulse peak by roughly @xmath9 and have a total width of approximately @xmath10 .",
    "more accurate scaling reveals that they have widths of some 2.3@xmath5 and that their centers are separated by just twice this interval .",
    "note also that b1929 + 10 s profile is generally fully linearly polarized , so that the features are most clearly seen in both the total power and total linear polarization , where they represent about a 40% diminuation of the power at their centers .",
    "the `` notches '' do appear to be just visible in a sensitive 430-mhz observation of blaskiewicz  ( 1991 : see their fig .",
    "22 ) , though they are not seen at 1.4 ghz either in this paper or in rankin & rathnasree",
    ". this may be due to the overall weakening of the broad low - level emission feature that follows the mp as well as the poorer signal - to - noise of the 21-cm observations . neither ,",
    "unfortunately , were the recent observations of weisberg  ( 2003 ) sufficiently sensitive to detect the features .",
    "similar features have also been observed by navarro  ( 1997 ) in the average profile of the millisecond pulsar j0437@xmath04715 .",
    "these `` notches '' fall on the trailing edge of this star s very broad profile , some 70@xmath5 after the bright central component . here , the pair is separated by about 3.3@xmath5 , the half - power widths are about a degree , and the fractional intensity decrease at their centers is about 50% .",
    "these characteristics are clearly seen in the 1512-mhz polarization profile of navarro  ( their fig .",
    "4 ) which we reproduce here as fig .",
    "[ fig:0437a ] . however , this paper reports additional detections at frequencies of 438 and 660  mhz , and the three total - power profiles appear together in our fig .",
    "[ fig:0437b ] , aligned ( according to their fig .  5 caption ) on the basis of the anti - symmetric circularly polarized signature associated with the central component .",
    "one can see that the `` notches '' at the three frequencies do not quite align , falling slightly earlier at 660 and 1512 mhz .",
    "however , were the profiles aligned more nearly according the the centroids of the central component , the `` notches '' might well fall at just the same profile phase .",
    "it would be interesting to see the results of a timing alignment as carried out for b0950 + 08 above .",
    "finally , the features do appear to evolve somewhat with frequency , becoming wider and more separated at lower frequencies .",
    "it is noteworthy that , for all three pulsars , these unprecedented features have roughly the same angular width , implying that their overall scale is some nearly fixed fraction of the rotational cycle of the star [ as , apparently , is also the case for pulsar microstructure ( , popov  2002 ) ] .",
    "furthermore , for the two pulsars in which the features have been detected at more than one frequency , they seem to appear at exactly the same longitude .",
    "again , this is a well - known feature of pulsar microstructure , implying that the two phenomena derive from the same physical regions in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "pulsar microstructure generally shows the same width regardless of frequency , however , there is evidence for the width of the notch features decreasing with frequency .",
    "b0950 + 08 and b1929 + 10 have remarkably similar properties .",
    "both are very bright , have quarter - second rotational periods , and are very nearby .",
    "both pulsars have detectable emission over an unusually broad fraction of their rotation cycle and both exhibit interpulses . with a spin period of 5.75",
    "ms , j0437@xmath04715 has very different spin - down properties ; however , it is also nearby , extremely bright , and , while it has no interpulse , it has detectable emission over more than @xmath11 of longitude .",
    "the identification of these features in the three brightest pulsars with broad pulse profiles suggests that such features may be common among pulsars with broad profiles . as they are apparently seen over a substantial portion of the radio band and evolve little with frequency",
    ", it would seem that they can not be attributed to absorption in any usual sense .",
    "thus it would seem that they are either due to some very puzzling aspect of the emission process or represent an equally puzzling obscuration of the emission along our sight line .",
    "while we can not more than speculate about the causes of these features , a very novel mechanism is being suggested by wright ( 2003 ) in a companion paper",
    ". clearly , few pulsars show emission so far from the main pulse or interpulse , so observing this feature in more pulsars will be very difficult until the advent of more sensitive pulsar instruments such as the ska . however , future more sensitive multi - frequency observations of the pulsars discussed above , in addition to polarimetric observations , may yield more clues as to the origin of these unusual features .",
