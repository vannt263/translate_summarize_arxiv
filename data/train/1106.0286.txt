    "this filtering process increases the probability that the connected users know each other , and makes the extracted network a reliable proxy to the underlying social network .",

    "here we describe the network mapping method used to infer the popularity and similarity coordinates in the considered real networks .    given a snapshot of a real network consisting of @xmath2 nodes",
    ", we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method described in  @xcite to compute the current radial ( popularity ) @xmath122 and angular ( similarity ) @xmath123 coordinates for each node @xmath4 in the network . in this section",
    "we briefly describe this method .",
    "see  @xcite for further details .    to infer the radial coordinates",
    "is relatively easy . in section  [ sec : a1 ] , we derive the exact relation between the expected current degree @xmath124 of node @xmath4 and its current radial coordinate @xmath122 in the model , @xmath125 , where @xmath11 is the current radius of the hyperbolic disc . therefore to infer the radial coordinates in a real network , we use the same expression substituting in it the real degrees @xmath126 of nodes instead of their expected degrees .",
    "the inference of the angular coordinates is much more involved . in summary , we first measure the average degree , power - law exponent , and average clustering in the network to determine @xmath6 , @xmath127 , and @xmath57 , and then execute the metropolis - hastings algorithm trying to find the angular coordinates that would maximize the probability ( or likelihood ) @xmath128^{1-a_{ij}},\\\\ p(x_{ij})&=&\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\frac{x_{ij}-r_t}{t}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that a given real network with adjacency matrix @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and with given node coordinates defining the hyperbolic distances @xmath60 between nodes , is produced by the model with the measured parameters .",
    "the algorithm operates by repeating the following steps :    1 .",
    "compute the current likelihood @xmath129 ; 2 .   select a random node ; 3 .",
    "move it to a new random angular location ; 4 .   compute the new likelihood @xmath130 ; 5 .   if @xmath131 , accept the move ; 6 .",
    "otherwise , accept the move with probability @xmath132 ;    and some manual intervention and guidance are needed for this algorithm to actually succeed in a reasonable amount of computing time  @xcite .    given a historical series of real network topology snapshots @xmath133 , we first map @xmath65 to the hyperbolic space exactly as just described , i.e.",
    ", we compute the current radial coordinate , and angular position of each node . in the previous section ,",
    "we have considered a series of @xmath70 as internet snapshots @xmath134 , a series of @xmath112 _",
    "e.coli _ metabolic network snapshots @xmath116 and two series of two pgp web of trust snapshots @xmath96 and @xmath135 . for new nodes in consecutive snapshots of a series",
    "we compute their hyperbolic coordinates keeping the coordinates of old nodes fixed .",
    "that is , once a node appears at some time and gets its coordinates computed , its coordinates never change .",
    "although according to the model the radial coordinates of nodes should increase with time ( unless @xmath31 ) , here , for simplicity , we keep them fixed .",
    "this simplification is justified because the difference @xmath136 in the radial coordinate of every node in snapshots with @xmath137 and @xmath2 nodes is not significant in the closely spaced snapshot series that we consider .",
    "in particular , the maximum value of @xmath138 in the internet , metabolic and pgp snapshot series is respectively @xmath139 .",
    "another simplification is that since the old node coordinates are fixed , we compute the angular coordinate for new nodes @xmath48 using only their local contributions to the total likelihood in equation  ( [ eq : l ] ) , i.e. , instead of  ( [ eq : l ] ) we use @xmath140^{1-a_{ij}}$ ] .",
    "figure  3 shows that the empirical connection probabilities between new and old nodes in the internet , _",
    "e.coli _ metabolic network , and pgp web of trust , follow their theoretical predictions .",
    "these results signify that new connections in these networks are established as our popularity@xmath45similarity optimization framework predicts .",
    "here we show that the mapping method yields meaningful results , without overfitting or other artifacts .",
    "the number of parameters in the model is large .",
    "it is proportional to the network size , since we have to infer coordinates for each node .",
    "therefore a natural question that arises is whether the mapping method described above yields meaningful results . in particular , could it be the case that the good match between empirical and theoretical connection probabilities in fig .",
    "3 is due to overfitting ?    in this section we show that the inference results are indeed meaningful , since we find strong correlations between inferred coordinates and network - specific node attributes in each considered network .",
    "we also compute the logarithmic loss , which is the metric of the inference quality for statistical inference methods based on maximum - likelihood estimation .",
    "we show that this quality is good for each considered network , confirming that the results in fig",
    ".  3 are not an ( overfitting ) artifact .",
    "finally , we provide an example of real network ( imdb ) , where this quality is poor , and so is the logarithmic loss .",
    "collectively , these results show that the inference method does not suffer from overfitting .",
    "in particular , if it were the case , then this method would yield statistically good results for _ any _ network .        in  @xcite , where we study internet routing",
    ", we use the method described in section  [ sec : mapping ] to map the archipelago as topology of june 2009 , used in section  [ sec : internet_data ] .",
    "the mapping yields meaningful results , since ass belonging to the same country are mapped close to each other , see figs .  3 and 5 in  @xcite . more",
    "precisely , one can see from figs .",
    "3,5 in  @xcite that for the majority of countries , their ass are localized in narrow angular regions .",
    "that is , even though the mapping method is completely geography - agnostic , it discovers meaningful groups or communities of ass belonging to the same country .",
    "the reason for this effect is that ass belonging to the same country are usually connected more densely to each other than to the rest of the world , and the method correctly places all such ass in narrow regions close to each other .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "3 in  @xcite that in many cases , geographically or politically close countries are located close to each other on the circle .",
    "these results prove that the angular coordinates inferred by the method reflect reality well , as is the case with the other two networks that we consider here .",
    "distances in metabolic network maps give a measure of the chemical potential of metabolites to participate jointly in reactions , such that higher reaction likelihoods are naturally associated to metabolites which are closer in the underlying space .",
    "it is then expected that metabolites participating in reactions in the same biochemical pathway would cluster in specific regions in the inferred space .",
    "this was indeed observed in  @xcite for the cartographic network representation of the metabolism of _",
    "e.coli_ , see figs .  2 , 3 and 4 there .",
    "the geometric embedding of the metabolic network in fig .",
    "2 in  @xcite , obtained by the same mapping method we use in this paper , shows that metabolites that participate jointly in reactions are mapped close to each other , i.e. , in the same angular regions . in particular , pathways  classically understood as chains of step - by - step reactions which transform a principal chemical into another  are in general strongly localized , even though some adopt either a discrete bi - modal or a multi - peaked form , and only a very small fraction transversally spread over the circle ( fig .  3 in  @xcite",
    "furthermore , pathways in related functional categories tend to concentrate into well defined sectors ( fig .  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore our model discriminates well the concentrated pathways , most frequent and consistent with the classical view of modular subsystems , from others , formed of subunits , and even from those responsible of producing or consuming metabolites used extensively in many other pathways .      to see if the mapping method yields meaningful results in the case of the pgp web of trust ( wot ) , we consider its mapped topology of april 2003 from section  [ sec : pgp_data ] . for each node ( pgp certificate ) in the topology , the data we use  @xcite contain the email address of the corresponding owner of the pgp certificate . for each email address",
    "we can identify the top - level domain that the email address belongs to , which is the last part of the email address .",
    "examples of top - level domains are .com , .net , .org , .de , .fr . , .it and other country codes",
    "therefore , for each node in the pgp network we can identify the top - level domain that the node belongs to .",
    "if the inferred angular coordinates reflect reality well , then we expect pgp nodes belonging to the same country code to be mapped to angular locations close to each other , since in general people in the wot are expected to trust other people from their own country more . by contrast , we do not expect this to be the case for generic top - level domains such as .net . in fig .",
    "s15 we show that the mapping method indeed yields meaningful results , as expected .            in general",
    ", a statistical inference method may suffer from overfitting if the number of parameters in the model is comparable or larger than the number of predicted parameters . here",
    "we show that for any reasonably sized network , the former is much smaller than the latter in our model .    indeed , given a snapshot of a real network consisting of @xmath2 nodes ,",
    "the mapping method in section  [ sec : mapping ] finds the angular coordinate of every node in the network such that the likelihood that the network is produced by the model is maximized .",
    "that is , if there are @xmath2 nodes in the network the method infers @xmath2 parameters ( angular coordinates )",
    ".    however , we stress that if a network consists of @xmath2 nodes , then there are @xmath141 node pairs in the network , and for each node pair @xmath142 , the model predicts an independent probability of the existence of a link between this node pair @xmath143 .",
    "if the mapping is successful , then _ every _ node pair @xmath142 is placed at the right hyperbolic distance . in other words , if the fitting is successful , then with _ just _ @xmath2 parameters , the model manages to successfully make @xmath141 predictions .",
    "if we consider new nodes in a subsequent snapshot , the method infers their angular coordinates such that they are all placed at the right hyperbolic distances with respect to the old nodes .",
    "if there are @xmath144 new nodes and @xmath2 existing nodes , and the mapping is successful , then with _ just _ @xmath144 parameters , the model makes @xmath145 predictions .",
    "if a real network is well described by the model , then the fitting of the large number of unknowns with a significantly smaller number of parameters is expected to be successful , as fig .",
    "3 illustrates . however , to compute the empirical connection probability in fig .",
    "3 , we have to bin the hyperbolic distances into a small number of bins to have statistically reliable results for ratios of the number of connected node pairs to the total number of node pairs at distances within each bin . instead of a large ensemble of graphs generated with the same parameters",
    ", we have only one real network , and we do not have any other method to compute the empirical connection probability for it . therefore it is desirable to assess the mapping quality using an appropriate metric independent of any binning .",
    "such metric for maximum - likelihood inference methods is logarithmic loss .",
    "in general , the logarithmic loss  @xcite is defined as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is likelihood . since",
    "maximum - likelihood inference methods operate by maximizing likelihood , logarithmic loss is a natural metric of the quality of the results that these methods produce .",
    "specifically , if the results are good , then logarithmic loss is small . to estimate how small is `` small '' here",
    ", one usually compares against the case with random parameter assignments .",
    "in our case , the likelihood @xmath58 is defined in equation  ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "that is , for a given real network and a given set of inferred coordinates , the logarithmic loss is @xmath148 + ( 1- a_{ij } ) \\log \\left[1-p(x_{ij})\\right]\\right],\\ ] ] where the above sum goes over all @xmath141 pairs of nodes @xmath149 , where @xmath2 is the network size .",
    "that is , we stress that logarithmic loss depends on _ all _ the @xmath141 predicted probabilities @xmath143 .",
    "the logarithmic loss is nothing but the absolute value of the logarithm of the probability that the network is generated by the model , given the set of inferred node coordinates .",
    "we compute logarithmic losses for the internet , _",
    "e.coli _ metabolic network , and the pgp web of trust , with the node coordinates inferred by our mapping method .",
    "we contrast these logarithmic losses against those obtained for the same networks with random angular coordinates .",
    "that is , we first assign to each node an angular coordinate drawn uniformly at random from @xmath150 $ ] .",
    "the randomized logarithmic loss is then @xmath151 + ( 1- a_{ij } ) \\log \\left[1-p(\\tilde{x}_{ij})\\right]\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath152 is the hyperbolic distance between nodes @xmath48 and @xmath153 with random angular coordinates .",
    "the smaller the @xmath154 compared to @xmath155 , the better the quality of the mapping , i.e. , the better our model describes a given real network .    to test the robustness of the inferred coordinates we also calculate logarithmic losses after distorting inferred angular coordinate @xmath47 to @xmath156 where @xmath157 radians and @xmath158 a random variable drawn uniformly from the interval @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the logarithmic loss values are reported in table  [ tab : si_table1 ] . from the table",
    "we observe that the logarithmic losses calculated using the inferred angular coordinates are significantly smaller than those with random angular coordinates , indicating that the considered real networks are well described by our model , corroborating the results in fig .",
    ".logarithmic losses calculated with the inferred coordinates , distorted angular coordinates with @xmath157 radians , and fully randomized angular coordinates , for the internet ( april 2007 snapshot ) , _",
    "e.coli _ metabolic network ( @xmath65 snapshot ) , and pgp web of trust ( april 2003 snapshot ) .",
    "the last column shows the ratios of likelihoods @xmath160 , which are the ratios of the probability that the network is produced by the model with the inferred angular coordinates , to the same probability with all these coordinates being random .",
    "[ tab : si_table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also compute logarithmic losses considering only the links between new and old nodes .",
    "that is , given two consecutive snapshots of a network @xmath161 and @xmath162 , we define the logarithmic loss as @xmath163 + ( 1- a_{ij } ) \\log \\left[1-p(x_{ij})\\right]\\right],\\ ] ] where summation is now over only @xmath145 new - old node pairs , and where @xmath2 is the number of old nodes , and @xmath144 the number of new nodes .",
    "again , the logarithmic losses using the inferred angular coordinates of new nodes are significantly smaller than those obtained using randomized angular coordinates , see table  [ tab : si_table2 ] , signifying that new connections in these networks are well described by the popularity@xmath45similarity optimization .",

    "specifically , we consider the actor network from the internet movie database ( imdb )  @xcite .",
    "to build the network we connect two actors if they have co - starred in at least one film , limiting our consideration only to films labeled as comedies .",
    "the largest connected subgraph of the resulting network in the year of @xmath176 consists of @xmath177 actors and has average degree @xmath178 , and average clustering @xmath179 .",
    "this actor network is another example of a growing network with strong clustering and heterogeneous node degrees .",
    "however , the mapping of this network using our method is poor , as illustrated by the connection probability in fig .",
    "s16 .",
    "we also compute the logarithmic loss for this network using the inferred node coordinates .",
    "the result is @xmath180 .",
    "this value is larger than the one obtained after randomizing the node angular coordinates , @xmath181 , so that @xmath182 .    the reason why our model does not describe the actor network",
    "well is the following . by construction ,",
    "the network is overinflated with fully connected subgraphs , since many modern film crews include hundreds of dissimilar actors .",
    "any pair of such actors participating at least once in such a large - scale film project , are connected , leading to an abundance of large cliques in the network . as a result of this overinflation , even not so famous actors that may join the project coming from many different countries , have high chances to be connected .",
    "that is , connections in this network are not well described by popularity@xmath45similarity optimization , because even fairly dissimilar and unpopular actors may be connected with high probability .",

    "becomes @xmath417 , which is similar to equation ( [ eq : con_prob_model_3 ] ) , and a straightforward analysis as above can be applied .",

    "+ to summarize this section , synthetic networks growing according to popularity@xmath45similarity optimization reproduce several important structural characteristics of real technological , biological , and social networks .",

    "s11(a ) , s12(a ) ) .",
    "the work that comes perhaps closest to our approach is by dsouza et al .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the authors show that pa can emerge in a tradeoff optimization framework requiring only local information .",
    "the framework is motivated by how connections in the internet may take place .",
    "specifically , the motivation is that a new as may want to establish connections that would minimize the startup costs , while still providing good performance to its users . in the model , a new node",
    "is placed on the unit interval where distances abstract the connection fibre costs , and then connects to an existing node minimizing a balance between these costs and the shortest path hop - lengths to the core in the network , the latter abstracting performance in terms of the average delay from the new node to the rest of the network .",
    "the authors then focus only on the degree distribution in the graphs produced by this model , showing that with a specific fit of parameters , it matches well the degree distribution of the internet extracted from the whois data .",
    "the basic model studied in this work generates trees , since each incoming node connects to @xmath443 existing nodes , but the authors suggest at the end that for @xmath446 the model may lead to some non - zero clustering .",
    "the fact that similarity between nodes affects the linking probability in networks has been observed , studied , and modeled extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the works by menczer  @xcite where he introduces a model for text corpora with linking probability that augments standard pa with document similarity measures .",
    "the latter can be the standard cosine similarity for a pair of documents , defined by the normalized count of words common to both documents .",
    "the author then shows that this model describes well the degree and similarity distributions in the dmoz web data and in a collection of articles published in pnas . in",
    "@xcite he also shows that similarity information can help to improve web navigation , an observation confirmed later in a more abstract context  @xcite , where similarity is modeled by distances on the unit interval . in  @xcite a modification of the model of  @xcite is proposed where the linking probability is proportional to the product of the degrees of the documents and their cosine similarity .",
    "the authors then show that this model can describe the clustering coefficient in document networks better compared to  @xcite . in  @xcite similarity attributes",
    "are modeled by vectors in an @xmath448-dimensional space .",
    "a new node first selects a certain group of existing nodes ( community ) based on similarity distances between the new and existing nodes . within the community",
    "the attachment then follows standard pa . that is , this model also augments pa with similarity .",
    "the authors conclude by showing that the model generates graphs with power - law degree distributions and exponent @xmath449 , and some community structure .",
    "no real networks are considered .",
    "a wider class of models augment pa not with similarity information _ per se _ , but with some spatial information  @xcite , see also section  4.4 in  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "nodes are located in some space , and the linking probability depends not only on node degrees as in standard pa , but also on distances between nodes in the space . if this linking probability decreases with the spatial distance fast enough , then such models generate graphs with strong clustering for a very simple reason : since close nodes have high probability of being connected , then the triangle inequality in the space leads to a large number of triangles in the network .",
    "yet the mechanism responsible for power - law degree distributions in these models is the same pa .",
    "yet wider and more general class of models , to which our approach actually belongs , are the network models with hidden variables  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "some hidden variables are first assigned to nodes , and the linking probability between a pair of nodes is then a function of the values of their hidden variables .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the authors show that a combination of exponentially distributed hidden variables and step - function connection probability leads to power - law degree distributions and strong clustering in modeled networks , while in  @xcite it is shown that pa itself can be casted as a hidden variable model , where one of the hidden variables is the node birth time .",
    "a variety of other mechanisms have been proposed to fix the zero - clustering problem with pa .",
    "one such mechanism is node activation / deactivation  @xcite motivated by citation networks .",
    "a set of @xmath6 active nodes is maintained in the model , and the new , initially active node connects to this set by @xmath6 links .",
    "one active node is then deactivated with probability inversely proportional to the node degree .",
    "because of this inverse proportionality imposed by the model , the model effectively implements linear pa .",
    "because the new connections are made to local groups of active nodes , clustering is strong .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite the model is effectively one dimensional , lacking the small - world property observed in many real networks .",
    "another popular mechanism enforcing strong clustering is random walks  @xcite .",
    "a new node connects first to a random existing node , and then with some probability to one of its neighbors , and possibly to a neighbor of its neighbor , etc .",
    "clustering is strong because the connections are concentrated in a local neighborhood of the attachment node .",
    "the lack of clustering is not the only problem with standard pa .",
    "another problem is that pa _ per se _ is simply impossible in a vast majority of real networks because to `` implement '' pa , the network evolution process must `` know '' the global current structure of the whole network in order to compute the degree for each node . since such knowledge is often unavailable in reality , pa must be an emergent phenomenon , i.e. , an effective result of some other underlying evolution processes that use only local information .",
    "yet another related problem is that such processes must lead to exactly linear pa , since if the attachment probability is not a linear function of node degree , then the degree distribution in the network is not a power law  @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to address these two problems as well .",
    "the aforementioned random walks , for example , do solve them both because the probabilities of the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph are linearly proportional to node degrees .",
    "another interesting observation was made in  @xcite where the authors show that connections based solely on node ranking may lead to power laws , the motivation being that node ranking is a coarser proxy to popularity than the node degree .",
    "yet the simplest and perhaps the first model that addresses the three mentioned concerns with pa  zero - clustering , global knowledge , and linearity  is by dorogovtsev _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite : the new node simply selects a random existing link , and connects to its both ends .",
    "clustering is obviously strong , and linear pa is resurrected because the probability that a random link is attached to a node of degree @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "however , this model is clearly a toy model , and there have been no attempts to validate it against any real networks .      as far as validation is concerned , the model validation methodology is usually limited to generating synthetic graphs according to the model prescription , and comparing one or more of their structural properties , such as the degree distribution , against those in real networks .",
    "remarkably , the core of the network evolution mechanism proposed by a model is quite rarely validated directly , because such validation is either difficult or impossible . in similarity - based models , for example ,",
    "such validation is difficult because there are too many different similarity measures , and it is usually unclear which one should be used in which case  @xcite , so that cases where model predictions are validated directly against real - world similarity data  @xcite are rare , and usually limited to specific ( types of ) networks .    within our approach ,",
    "the direct validation of the network evolution mechanism is also difficult but possible .",
    "it is possible because we can infer the node coordinates in the generic similarity space as discussed in section  [ sec : mapping ] , and then check if the linking probability in real networks as a function of distances between nodes in this space is close to our model predictions , see fig .",

    "<S> we will use this metric extensively below .        </S>",
    "<S> the networks grown as described may seem to have nothing in common with preferential attachment ( pa )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) that the probability @xmath17 that an existing node of degree @xmath18 attracts a connection from a new node is the same linear function of @xmath18 in the described model and in pa . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising then that the degree distributions in pa and our model are the same power laws . in section  [ sec : a1 ] we prove that the exponent @xmath19 of this power law approaches @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> preferential attachment thus emerges as an effective process originating from optimization trade - offs between popularity and similarity .    however , there are crucial differences between such optimization and pa . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> new nodes connect with the same probability @xmath17 to _ any _ nodes of degree @xmath18 in the network . in the former , new nodes connect only to specific _ subsets _ of such @xmath18-degree nodes that are closest to the new node along the similarity dimension @xmath21 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> to quantify , we compare in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) the probability of connection between a pair of nodes as a function of their hyperbolic distance in the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> we see that close nodes are almost always connected in the optimization model , while in pa the probability of their connections is lower by an order of magnitude . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> far apart nodes are never connected in the optimization model , as opposed to pa . </S>",
    "<S> these differences manifest themselves in the strength of clustering , which is the probability that two neighbors of the same node are connected . in pa , clustering is asymptotically zero  @xcite , while it is strong in many real networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show in section  [ sec : a1 ] that the described optimization model leads to clustering that is strongest possible for networks with a given average degree and degree distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> clustering and the power - law exponent can both be adjusted to arbitrary values via the following model modifications . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the effect of popularity fading , observed in many real networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the closer the node to the center in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , the more popular it is  the more new connections it attracts , and the higher its degree  providing the intuition behind the emergence of preferential attachment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore to model popularity fading , we let all nodes drift away from the center such that the radial coordinate of node @xmath4 at time @xmath22 is increasing @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath12 , and parameter @xmath25 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this modification is identical to minimizing @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 with @xmath28 ) instead of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it changes the power - law exponent to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath30 , the nodes do not move and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath32 , all nodes move with the maximum speed , always lying on the circle of radius @xmath11 , while the network degenerates to a random geometric graph growing on the circle . </S>",
    "<S> pa emerges at any @xmath33 since the attraction probability @xmath17 is a linear function of degree @xmath18 , @xmath34 , the same as in pa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we prove these statements in sections  [ sec : a1][sec : a4 ] , where we also show that the popular fitness model  @xcite can be mapped to our geometric optimization framework by letting different nodes drift away with different speeds ( section  [ sec : a2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since strongest clustering is due to connections to the closest nodes , to weaken clustering we allow connections to farther nodes . </S>",
    "<S> connecting to the @xmath6 closest nodes is approximately the same as connecting to nodes lying within distance @xmath35 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and section  [ sec : a1 ] , where we derive the exact expression for @xmath36 fixing the average degree in the network . </S>",
    "<S> if new nodes @xmath2 establish connections to existing nodes @xmath4 with probability @xmath37 $ ] , where parameter @xmath38 is the network temperature and @xmath16 is the hyperbolic distance between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath2 , then clustering is a decreasing function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> that is , temperature is the parameter controlling clustering in the network . at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the connection probability @xmath39 is either @xmath40 or @xmath41 depending on whether distance @xmath16 is less or greater than @xmath36 , so that we recover the strongest clustering case above , where new nodes connect only to the closest existing nodes . </S>",
    "<S> clustering gradually decreases to zero at @xmath42 , and remains asymptotically zero for any @xmath43  ( sections  [ sec : a1 ] ,  [ sec : zeta_extension ] ) . at high temperatures @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> the model degenerates either to growing random graphs , or , remarkably , to standard pa  ( section  [ sec : a4 ] ) .    to investigate </S>",
    "<S> if similarity shapes the structure and dynamics of real networks as our model predicts , we consider a series of historical snapshots of the internet , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.coli _ metabolic network , and the web of trust between people . </S>",
    "<S> the first two networks are disassortative , while the third is assortative , and its degree distribution deviates from power laws . </S>",
    "<S> we map these networks to their popularity@xmath45similarity spaces ( methods summary ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping infers the radial ( popularity ) and angular ( similarity ) coordinates for all nodes , so that we can compute the hyperbolic distances between all node pairs , and the probability of new connections as a function of the hyperbolic distance between corresponding nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this probability is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is close to the theoretical prediction by the model .        </S>",
    "<S> this finding is important for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , it shows that real - world networks evolve as our framework predicts . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , given the popularity and similarity coordinates of two nodes , they link with probability close to the theoretical in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the framework may thus be used for link prediction , a notoriously difficult and important problem in many disciplines  @xcite , with applications ranging from predicting protein interactions or terrorist connections to designing recommender and collaborative filtering systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 _ directly _ validates our framework and its core mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising then that , as a consequence , the synthetic graphs that the model generates are remarkably similar to real networks across a range of metrics  ( section  [ sec : dk_compare ] ) , implying that the framework can be also used for veracious modeling of real network topologies . </S>",
    "<S> we review related work in section  [ sec : related_work ] , and to the best of our knowledge , there is no model that would simultaneously : ( 1 )  be simple and universal , i.e. , applicable to many different networks , ( 2 )  have a similarity space as its core component , ( 3 )  cast pa as an emergent phenomenon , ( 4 )  generate graphs similar to real networks across a wide range of metrics , and ( 5 )  validate the proposed growth mechanism directly . </S>",
    "<S> validation is usually limited to comparing certain graph metrics , such as degree distribution , between modeled and real networks , which `` validates '' a consequence of the mechanism , not the mechanism itself . </S>",
    "<S> direct validation is usually difficult because proposed mechanisms tend to incorporate many unmeasurable factors  economic or political factors in internet evolution , for example . </S>",
    "<S> we can not measure all the factors or node attributes contributing to node similarity in any of the considered real networks either . yet </S>",
    "<S> , the angular distances between nodes in our approach can be considered as projections of properly weighted combinations of all such similarity factors affecting network evolution , and we can infer these distances using statistical inference methods , directly validating the growth mechanism .    to summarize , popularity is attractive , but so is similarity . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting the latter would lead to severe aberrations . in the internet , for example , a local network in nebraska would connect directly to a local network in tibet , the same way as in the web , a person not even knowing tartini or free soloing would suddenly link her page to these subjects . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of such dissimilar connections is very low in reality , and the stronger the similarity forces , the smaller this probability is . neglecting the network similarity structure leads to overestimations or underestimations of the probability of dissimilar or similar connections by orders of magnitude ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can not tell the difference with preferential attachment by examining node degrees only . </S>",
    "<S> the probability that an existing node of degree  @xmath18 attracts a new link optimizing popularity@xmath45similarity is exactly the same linear function of @xmath18 as in preferential attachment ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  s1 shows that this function is indeed realized in the considered real networks , re - validating _ effective _ preferential attachment for these networks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the popularity@xmath45similarity optimization approach provides a natural geometric explanation for the following `` dilemmas '' with preferential attachment . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , preferential attachment has been validated for many real networks , while on the other hand , it requires exogenous mechanisms to explain not only strong clustering , but also linear popularity preference , and how such preference can emerge in real networks , where nodes do not have any global information about the network structure . </S>",
    "<S> since preferential attachment appears as an _ emergent phenomenon _ in the framework developed here , this framework provides a simple and natural resolution to these dilemmas , and this resolution is directly validated against large - scale evolution of drastically different real networks . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with the observation that the knowledge of exactly the closest nodes in the hyperbolic popularity@xmath45similarity space does require the precise global information about all node locations </S>",
    "<S> . however , non - zero temperatures smooth out the sharp connectivity perimeter threshold in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , thus modeling reality where this proximity information is not precise and mixed with errors and noise . in that respect , </S>",
    "<S> preferential attachment is a limiting regime with similarity forces reduced to nothing but noise . </S>"
