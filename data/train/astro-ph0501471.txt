    "variability was discovered in the x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) roughly three decades ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "it was clear that this power - law must break at some lower frequency , or the power would diverge , and some evidence for this was found using longer - term archival observations @xcite .",
    "it was not until the launch of _ rxte _ , however , that this break was measured definitively @xcite .",
    "a number of high quality power spectra have now been obtained , primarily using _ rxte _ and _ xmm - newton _ data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". these have shown breaks to be common and emphasized the similarity of agn power spectra to that of the black hole binary cyg  x-1 . in the low / hard state ,",
    "the power spectrum of cyg  x-1 exhibits a twice - broken power - law which breaks from a slope of @xmath3 to @xmath4 at the ` low - frequency break ' ( @xmath5 ) and from @xmath6 to @xmath7 at the ` high - frequency break ' ( @xmath8 ) , with @xmath916  hz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the high / soft state , the power spectrum exhibits only a high - frequency break , with @xmath91015  hz ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "though still a subject of debate , the emerging consensus is that we usually see the high - frequency break in the agn power - spectra , although two breaks are apparently seen in two objects ( viz , akn  564 and ngc  3783 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) ngc  4051 , there is no low - frequency turnover to @xmath10 down to very low frequencies , which led @xcite to hypothesise that this object ( and possibly all nls1s ) resembled cyg x-1 in the high / soft state .",
    "determining accurate power - spectra for agn is difficult , as it requires high quality data with near - even sampling .",
    "such data are available only for a limited number of objects and are very costly to obtain in terms of observing time .",
    "it is nonetheless very useful to quantify the x - ray variability of agn to compare with other properties , and normalised excess variance , denoted as @xmath11 , is much simpler to calculate @xcite .",
    "an anti - correlation was found between excess variance and luminosity for a sample of agns observed by the _",
    "advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _",
    "( _ asca _ ) , confirming the _ exosat _ results but with a larger sample of objects @xcite .",
    "later work also using _ asca _ data revealed that , for a given luminosity , the x - ray light curves of nls1s exhibit a larger excess variance than the classical seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , again using _ asca _ data , studied the relationship between the excess variance ( on a time - scale of roughly 1  d ) and the black hole mass .",
    "those studies revealed an anti - correlation between @xmath11 and mass , which is suggestive that this is the primary relationship rather than with luminosity .",
    "the nls1s appeared to follow the same relationship as the other agn .",
    "@xcite investigated the relationship between excess variance and black hole mass on much longer time - scales ( @xmath12  d ) using _ rxte _ data on a sample of 10  agns .",
    "the classical seyfert  1 galaxies followed a variance  mass relation that is consistent with a universal power - spectral shape as described above for the low / hard state of cyg  x-1 . in the universal model used by @xcite",
    ", @xmath8 is inversely proportional to black hole mass , and the amplitude , when represented in power @xmath13 frequency space , is assumed to be constant . in agreement with the power spectrum analysis of mchardy ( 2004 )",
    ", @xcite found that the nls1 ngc  4051 did not follow the same variance ",
    "mass relationship described by the classical seyfert 1s .",
    "the excess variance of ngc  4051 was consistent with a singly - broken power - law , breaking from @xmath14 to @xmath7 , with a break - frequency @xmath15 times higher than that deduced for the other the seyfert  1s .",
    "these works show that excess variance can be a useful complement to full - blown power - spectral analysis , and have the advantage that they can be applied to a larger number , and wider variety of objects .",
    "as has been shown by @xcite , some caution must be exercised when interpreting excess variance measurements , primarily due to the red - noise shape of the power spectra and the stochastic nature of the variability .",
    "such effects have not been accounted for in the majority of previous works .",
    "the intention of the work presented here is to investigate the relationship between excess variance and mass in a large sample of agn , improving on these previous studies by fully accounting for measurement uncertainties , sampling and red - noise effects in the calculation of the excess variance and its uncertainty .",

    "all @xmath20 values collected from the literature were transformed to this cosmology as required .",
    "the number of _ asca _ observing sequences available for each object is shown in table  [ tab : geninfo ] .",
    "we extracted a 210  kev combined sis0@xmath25sis1@xmath25gis2@xmath25gis3 light curve from each sequence .",
    "these initial light curves had a resolution of 16  s and each bin was required to be fully exposed .",
    "the light curves were then rebinned to a resolution of 256  s.      for a red - noise process , the variance in a light curve depends both on the power spectrum of the variations and also on the time resolution and duration of the light curve .",
    "this means that different @xmath11 measurements are only strictly comparable if the durations of the light curves are equal .",
    "therefore , we sub - divided the light curve from each sequence into many segments of similar duration .",
    "the advantage of using long durations is that the amplitude of variability increases , and the number of points used to calculate @xmath11 is also larger , reducing the measurement uncertainty . on the other hand , using short durations has the advantage that more light curve segments can be included .",
    "we chose a nominal segment length of 40  ks for our analysis as a tradeoff between these considerations .",
    "in reality we chose a duration of 39936  ks which is an integer multiple of our 256  s time bin .",
    "the sub - dividing of the light curves proceeded as follows .",
    "first , the earliest 40  ks segment of the light curve for a certain observing sequence was selected . then , beginning with the next exposed bin following the end of this first segment , another 40  ks segment was selected .",
    "this continued until the light curve had been completely sub - divided .",
    "note that the actual duration of these light curves , which we define as the time between the first and last exposed bin , can be less than 40  ks because the dividing point between segments can occur when there is a gap in the data train .",
    "we accepted all resulting light curve segments that had a duration @xmath2630  ks .",
    "to ensure gaussian statistics , we required each 256  s bin to contain at least 20  counts .",
    "the number of counts in a certain 256  s bin depends both on the source counting rate and the fractional exposure of that bin .",
    "we do not wish to reject entire observing sequences simply because some of the bins have a low exposure , but those in which fully - exposed bins have @xmath27 counts should be excluded .",
    "if we were to remove bins simply because they had a low counting rate , we would be biased against observing objects when their intensity is low . selecting according to fractional exposure ,",
    "on the other hand , can remove bins having too few counts without introducing this bias , as fractional exposure is not related to the intensity of the source . if , for example , there are fully exposed bins with @xmath27 counts , the entire sequence was discarded .",
    "this is the case when we are dealing with a weak source . for brighter sources where only underexposed bins",
    "have @xmath27 counts , we excise all bins below some minimal fractional exposure .",
    "this gets rid of the non - gaussian bins , allowing us to keep the remainder of the light curve for further analysis , but introduces no bias against those times when the source is weak due to true flux variability .",
    "finally , we further required the truncated and screened light curve segments to have at least 20 bins , so that the variance could be determined accurately .",
    "this procedure resulted in 46 objects having at least 1 valid light curve segment , and a total of 305 valid segments in all .",
    "the number of segments for each object is given in table  [ tab : geninfo ] .",
    "the mean durations of the light curve segments for each object were in the range 3540  ks in the observers frame .",
    "the 48 objects in our sample have redshifts in the range 0.0010.234 .",
    "taking into account the redshift of each object , the rest - frame mean durations were in the range 3040  ks .",
    "we expect the effect of these slightly different durations to be small . for a power spectrum with a power - law slope of @xmath28 , the worst case we expect , a @xmath025  per  cent reduction in the light curve duration ( i.e. , from 40  ks to 30  ks ) results in a reduction in the @xmath11 of only @xmath00.1  dex .",
    "as presented later in this section , the uncertainties in most of our observed @xmath11 values are a few to several times larger than 0.1  dex .",
    "therefore , the @xmath025  per  cent difference between the shortest and longest mean light curve duration can be neglected and allows us to use more data than would have been available if we had imposed a strict limit on duration .",
    "we tested to see which objects exhibited significant variability by performing a chi - squared test .",
    "the @xmath29 corresponding to the hypothesis of a constant counting rate was determined for each @xmath040  ks light curve segment .",
    "then , for each object , we summed all of the @xmath29s and degrees - of - freedom ( dofs ) to test whether that object is variable .",
    "we detected variability in 33 objects at the 95  per  cent confidence level .",
    "we then calculated the excess variance in each light curve segment with the following expression :    @xmath30\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the number of bins in the segment , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the counting rates and uncertainties , respectively , in each bin , and @xmath34 is the unweighted arithmetic mean of the counting rates . for objects with more than one valid segment ,",
    "the unweighted average excess variance was determined .",
    "a major advantage of our work is that , given the large number of light curves available , there is often more than one valid segment per object ( see table  [ tab : geninfo ] ) .",
    "taking the mean @xmath11 of these multiple segments reduces the potentially large uncertainty owing to the stochastic nature of the variability ( see below ) .",
    "when calculating the mean excess variance we used _ all _ valid light curve segments for a particular object , including those segments that did not , in themselves , exhibit variability based on the @xmath29 test .      estimating the uncertainty for excess variance is somewhat complicated .",
    "analytical prescriptions have been given in the literature by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their correct formula is given by turner et  al .",
    "1999 ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter authors also discussed the uncertainties in @xmath11 on the basis of simulated red - noise light curves .",
    "these uncertainties depend both on measurement uncertainties ( e.g. , poisson noise ) in the light curve data , and the stochastic nature of the variability : any given light curve segment represents just one realisation of a random process , and thus can exhibit a different mean and variance from the true value , or another random segment .",
    "this ` noise ' uncertainty can be very large , especially for a single realisation .",
    "one must , therefore , account for this uncertainty before apparent differences in @xmath11 , either in a given source @xcite or in comparing sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be considered robust .",
    "the measurement and noise uncertainties on @xmath11 are unrelated , so can and must be estimated separately .    to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath11 owing to measurement uncertainties , we used bootstrap simulations ( the reader is directed to * ? ? ? * for a discussion on bootstrap simulations ) .",
    "suppose that the observed light curve contains @xmath31 bins .",
    "this light curve is a distribution of @xmath31 counting rates and corresponding poisson - noise uncertainties from which we calculate @xmath11 .",
    "note that calculating @xmath11 does not depend on the bins being in time - order .",
    "a bootstrap simulation involves randomly selecting , from that distribution , a new set of @xmath31 bins .",
    "the duplication of bins is permitted during the selection process .",
    "this , then , results in the creation of a slightly different distribution of counting rates , and @xmath11 can be determined for this new distribution .",
    "if one repeats the entire process many times , the resulting distribution of simulated @xmath11 values provides an estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath11 .",
    "we performed a series of 10000 bootstrap simulations to determine the uncertainty in the _ mean _ observed @xmath11 for each object in our sample .",
    "each of these simulations involved : simulating a new ` light curve ' from each valid light curve segment , determining @xmath11 for those simulated light curves , and then determing the mean of these simulated @xmath11 values .",
    "we were thus able to generate 10000 simulated values of the mean @xmath11 .",
    "the standard deviation of these values was taken to be the measurement uncertainty in the mean observed @xmath11 .",
    "we refer to this value as the ` bootstrap uncertainty ' and denote it as @xmath35 .",
    "estimates of the uncertainty owing to the noise process have been presented by @xcite , based on light curve simulations , who showed that the noise uncertainty is proportional to the mean value of the variance .",
    "the constant of proportionality depends on the power spectrum shape , which we do not know a priori .",
    "therefore , as pointed out by @xcite , it is preferable to determine the uncertainties in @xmath11 directly from the data .",
    "our large database contains 6 objects ( viz , akn  564 , mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 , ton  s180 , ngc  4151 , ngc  3516 , and ngc  5548 ) with a sufficient number of light curve segments ( @xmath2615 ) to make a meaningful estimate of the fractional uncertainty in @xmath11 owing to noise nature of our light curves .",
    "first , we determined the standard deviation @xmath37 of the observed @xmath11 values for each object .",
    "we then determined , from the bootstrap uncertainty , the standard deviation @xmath38 that we would expect to observe in the distribution of the @xmath11 values if the scatter was owing only to measurement uncertainties .",
    "we subtracted @xmath38 from @xmath37 , in quadrature , to obtain the standard deviation @xmath39 in the observed @xmath11 values that is owing only to the stochastic nature of the variability .",
    "we then determined , for each of the 6 distributions , the ratio between @xmath39 and mean @xmath11 .",
    "we shall refer to this ratio as the ` fractional standard deviation ' and denote it as @xmath40 .",
    "the fractional standard deviations for the 6 objects were : 0.49 ( akn  564 ) , 0.47 ( mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 ) , 0.69 ( ton  s180 ) , 0.79 ( ngc  4151 ) , 0.82 ( ngc  3516 ) , and 0.61 ( ngc  5548 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath40 show that , _ even in the absence of measurement uncertainties _ , one can expect noise uncertainties in the range @xmath05080  per  cent for individual measurments of @xmath11 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this highlights the need of obtaining many realisations ( i.e. , many measurements of @xmath11 ) , regardless of the level of poisson noise in the data .",
    "@xcite showed that the uncertainty in the estimated variance of a red - noise light curve increases with the steepness of the power spectrum slope .",
    "power - spectral analyses of agn have revealed that the value of @xmath8 generally decreases with increasing black hole mass .",
    "this means that the shape of the power spectrum in the frequency range probed by our light curves ( @xmath0@xmath41 to @xmath42  hz ) is expected to vary as a function of @xmath18 , such that the objects with the highest @xmath18 should exhibit the steepest ( @xmath43 ) power spectra .",
    "we expect , then , that the scatter in @xmath11 owing to red - noise fluctuations should also increase with mass .",
    "the lowest - mass objects are akn  564 and mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 , and the observed values of @xmath8 for these fall within the frequency range of our data @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath40 for this pair of objects to be less than the others .",
    "this does indeed appear to be the case : the @xmath40 values of akn  564 and mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 are both less than those of ton  s180 , ngc  4151 , ngc  3516 , and ngc  5548 .",
    "however , we possess only a limited number of individual @xmath11 measurements to estimate both the mean and standard deviation of each distribution , so it is possible that this apparent difference is not statistically significant .",
    "we decided , therefore , to compare the 6 distributions of @xmath11 values using a series of kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests .",
    "before we could compare the distributions , we first had to correct each of them for the effect of measurement uncertainties . to do this",
    ", we scaled the deviations of the observed @xmath11 values so that the standard deviation of the ` corrected ' distribution was equal to @xmath39 , with the mean @xmath11 remaining unchanged .",
    "we then normalised each of the corrected distributions by dividing the @xmath11 values by the mean .",
    "the corrected and normalised @xmath11 distributions for akn  564 and mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the same is true when comparing the other 4 distributions with each other .",
    "we then created two , combined distributions : one for akn  564 and mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 ; and another for ton  s180 , ngc  4151 , ngc  3516 , and ngc  5548 .",
    "the fractional standard deviations from these two combined distributions were 0.48 ( akn  564 , mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 ) and 0.74 ( ton  s180 , ngc  4151 , ngc  3516 , ngc  5548 ) , and a k - s test showed them to be different at the 95  per  cent confidence level .",
    "the cumulative distribution functions of the combined distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : snxs_cdf ] . combining the normalised ,",
    "corrected distributions of all 6 objects resulted in a @xmath40 of 0.61 .    for the objects",

    "for each of the other objects , we estimated the noise uncertainty and combined it in quadrature with the bootstrap uncertainty [ @xmath35 ] using the following expression :    @xmath46^{2 } } \\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the mean excess variance and @xmath47 is the number of available light curve segments . for objects with log  @xmath48 we adopted a fractional standard deviation of @xmath49 ,",
    "while for the objects with log  @xmath50 we adopted a value of @xmath51 .",
    "these ranges in mass were selected on the basis that the object mrk  766 , which has log  @xmath52 , is the most massive object that has an observed @xmath8 in the frequency ranged probed by our @xmath040  ks light curves . for objects more massive than this",
    "we expect @xmath8 to be less than our observed frequency range . in the absence of a measurement of @xmath18 or any information regarding the shape of the power spectrum",
    ", the mean value of @xmath53 can be adopted .",
    "the @xmath11 upper limits for the non - variable objects were also estimated by combining the two components of uncertainty .",
    "we multiplied the @xmath54 bootstrap uncertainty by the appropriate fractional standard deviation of the noise uncertainty .",
    "this value was then multiplied by 3 to provide an estimate of the @xmath55 upper - limit .",
    "we also estimated the @xmath55 ` bootstrap upper - limit ' by multiplying the bootstap - uncertainty @xmath35 by 3 .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath11 values for akn  564 and mcg@xmath366 - 30 - 15 are quite asymmetric , with each having an extended tail towards high values of @xmath11 .",
    "however , the distributions of log  @xmath11 look much more symmetric . this is not surprising as it is well known that the logarithmic transformation of a random variable with an extended tail in its distribution brings that distribution much closer to ` normality ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ideally , then , we would like to estimate log  @xmath11 from each segment and then determine the mean of log  @xmath11 for each object .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use this method because @xmath11 is negative for some light curve segments .",
    "we did , however , determine the logarithm of the mean @xmath11 , which brings the distribution of the mean @xmath11 closer to normality .",
    "we also transformed the uncertainties @xmath56 to be the uncertainty in the logarithm of the mean @xmath11 .",
    "the mean @xmath11 values , uncertainties and upper limits are listed in table  [ tab : geninfo ] .",
    "the column listing @xmath11 gives the uncertainty and @xmath55 upper limit as determined from only the bootstrap simulations .",

    "[ fig : collate_full_log_plawfits_2 ] .",
    "it is clear that there is a strong anti - correlation between the two quantities .",
    "this is confirmed using both a spearman rank - order correlation test and kendall s @xmath57 , both of which show the anti - correlation to be significant with @xmath2699.99  per  cent confidence .",
    "the upper limits to the variance in the case where no variability is detected , which are shown in the upper panel of fig .  [ fig : collate_full_log_plawfits_2 ] , are generally above the measured values ( for a given mass ) .",
    "this means they are unlikely to significantly affect any model fitting and we ignore them in the analysis below .",
    "while there is a strong general trend for objects with higher mass to be less variable , there is clearly substantial scatter in the variance  mass relationship .",
    "as we have , for the first time , presented realistic estimates of the uncertainties on @xmath11 we can be confident that this scatter is not owing only to these uncertainties .",
    "there is also evidence from the plot  albeit based solely on the lowest mass object , ngc 4395that the variance  mass relationship is non - linear .",

    "based on recent power - spectral analyses of agn , it is possible that the power spectra of agn have the same shape with the time - scale of the variations being proportional to black hole mass ( see introduction and references therein ) .",
    "we decided to investigate this possibility by modelling the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath18 with the assumption of a universal power spectrum .",
    "a model estimate can be made simply by integrating the continuous power spectrum over some frequency range , for example as defined by the length and the time bin size of the observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this , however , neglects the effects from the sampling pattern of the light curve , specifically the fact that it is binned , may have gaps , and is of finite duration . for reasons discussed below these effects ,",
    "particularly that of the finite duration and subsequent ` red - noise leak ' , are likely to be more important on the time - scales considered here than the much longer ones discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have taken an analytical approach to determining the model - predicted @xmath11 , rather than use simulations as is typical for power spectrum analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our approach is preferable for two reasons .",
    "first , simulations are far more computer - intensive , and second they rely on the simulation technique accurately reproducing the characteristics of the physical process giving rise to the variability . while the technique described below applies to calculation of model @xmath11 values it can be adapted straightforwardly to the estimation of discrete model power - spectra .",
    "according to parseval s theorem , the variance in a binned light curve is equal to the sum of the powers in the observed _ discrete _ power spectrum of that light curve . the model power spectrum ,",
    "however , is initially defined in a functional form and is thus _",
    "continous_. we denote this continuous power spectrum as @xmath74 .",
    "we need to determine how the discrete power spectrum @xmath75 is related to @xmath74 .",
    "the following description is appropriate for evenly sampled light curves containing no gaps and having an even number of bins .",
    "note also that the model power spectrum @xmath74 must be defined to be _ two - sided _ and , since we are dealing with a noise process , we refer to the expectation value of each power .",

    "suppose we have a continuous process , with power spectrum @xmath74 , and we transform it into a discrete process by binning the signal over a time period of @xmath76 .",
    "the power spectrum of the observed binned light curve , say @xmath77 , is related to the @xmath74 through the following relation :    @xmath78    where the binning function @xmath79 @xcite is given by :    @xmath80^{2}\\ ] ]    the next effect to consider is aliasing .",
    "the fact that the observed light curve is sampled at discrete intervals means that power can leak into the power spectrum from above the nyquist frequency @xmath81 .",
    "the binned and aliased power spectrum , say @xmath82 , is related to the intrinsic power spectrum @xmath74 through the relation @xcite :    @xmath83    the power in one of our typical model power spectra decreases sharply with frequency and the data are binned .",
    "this means that only a relatively small amount of power is aliased into the observed frequency range .",
    "accordingly , we found that summing from @xmath84 to @xmath85 was easily sufficient to account for aliasing .",
    "power spectra that are either flat or increase with frequency might require a larger range in @xmath86 .",
    "the final effect to account for is red - noise leak .",
    "this occurs when variations exist at frequencies lower than those sampled by the observed light curve , as is the case for a red - noise process .",
    "this ` leakage ' of power from low to high frequencies can be seen as either a rising or falling trend over the duration of the light curve .",
    "the power spectrum of the final light curve , i.e. @xmath75 , is related to the intrinsic power spectrum , i.e. @xmath74 , by the convolution of the @xmath87 with the so - called ` window function ' @xmath88 of the observed light curve . for evenly - sampled light curves",

    "the value of @xmath93 must be large enough so that the convolution extends to a low - enough frequency to account for all of the low - frequency power . determining a suitable value of @xmath93 required a process of trial - and - error .",

    "note that the introduction of the factor 2 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : conv ] means that @xmath75 is _ single - sided _ and it is defined only for @xmath97 frequencies .",
    "also note that , for @xmath98 the term @xmath94 was replaced by @xmath99 , to account for the end - effects in the numerical integral .",
    "the expected excess variance was then determined by summing the powers in @xmath75 :    @xmath100 + \\frac{1}{2 } p_{\\mathrm{d}}({\\nu_{\\mathrm{nyq } } } ) \\delta \\nu\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 .",
    "the factor of @xmath102 is required for @xmath103 because in a double - sided power spectrum the nyquist frequency occurs only once .",
    "the factor @xmath104 is required because the power is expressed in units of fractional - rms - squared per hz .",
    "each of our 305 light curve segments has its own particular duration and sampling pattern , and there are many gaps in the data train .",
    "therefore , the window function will be different for each segment and will not , in general , be represented by fejer s kernel .",

    "moreover , we have taken care to use light curve segments of similar durations . therefore , we were able to simplify the modelling procedure by assuming that our light curves were all fully sampled with the same number of bins .",
    "we used @xmath105 , as this is the even number - of - bins closest to the mean segment duration of 38143.5  s. having made this simplification , we were required to determine only a single value of @xmath106 for each object ( for a certain model power spectrum ) , thus speeding up the modelling process .      motivated by power - spectral analyses of agn ( see introduction , in particular * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and following the recent work of @xcite , we hypothesised a universal power spectrum of the form :    @xmath107    @xmath108    @xmath109    where the normalisation factor @xmath64 is the power at the high - frequency break @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite appealed to the analogy with black hole x - ray binaries and speculated that the location of the inner edge of the accretion disc in agn is perhaps related to the mass - accretion rate or the black hole spin . for a certain black hole mass , then , different agn might be regarded as existing in different states , just as cyg  x-1 is observed in different states . in this scenario , we would expect the x - ray variability of agn to be related not only to the black hole mass but also the eddington ratio and photon index .",
    "objects having a relatively high @xmath148 and soft x - ray spectra would , for a certain value of @xmath18 , have a relatively high value of @xmath8 ( i.e. , a high value of @xmath111 ) and should , therefore , exhibit a relatively high value of @xmath11 for a given range in time - scales .",
    "we found no evidence that the x - ray variability depends on these properties , and so the reality of this scenario remains to be established .",
    "note , however , that if an anti - correlation existed between @xmath111 and @xmath115 , then @xmath111 could possibly increase without there being a corresponding increase in @xmath11 .",
    "discriminating between various possible scenarios obviously requires the use of power spectral analyses , preferably covering a wide range in source properties .",
    "the challenge , then , is to assemble enough high - quality power spectra so that we can relate the power - spectral parameters not only to @xmath18 but also to eddington ratio and other quantities such as photon index .",
    "we note , in particular , that an analysis of the agn data in the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ archives , even from relatively short observations , would be useful in studying the properties ( e.g. , power - law slopes ) of the variability at frequencies above the high - frequency break .",
    "a natural starting point , of course , is to conduct a rigorous comparison between the currently available power spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the other relevent source properties .",
    "any conclusions draw from these comparisons could then be tested on a larger sample of objects by using measurements of excess variance .",
    "the authors are grateful to brad peterson for kindly providing some black hole mass measurements prior to publication .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions and comments .",
