    "since the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in 1995 @xcite , there was a significant interest about effects of the disordered potentials on the properties of ultracold quantum gases @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is not only because of the unavoidable irregularities in the trapping potential induced by wire imperfections @xcite , but also due to the fact that disorder can be generated and controlled using laser speckles @xcite .",
    "it is well known that cold atoms are a promising tool for simulating other physical systems @xcite in the sense of feynman s quantum simulator @xcite .",
    "this applies also to the phenomenon of anderson localization , which was originally used to microscopically describe the absence of diffusion in terms of disorder @xcite .",
    "it has a clear bec analogue @xcite , which has been directly observed @xcite .",
    "also , localization inside becs due to disorder created by atomic impurities on a lattice was studied theoretically @xcite and recently observed experimentally @xcite .    for a theoretical analysis of global dirty boson properties ,",
    "different methods have been used to describe various limits , ranging from the bogoliubov theory @xcite , numerical approaches @xcite , to the parisi replica method @xcite .",
    "it turns out that long - range correlations within both the condensate and the superfluid remain , despite the presence of disorder .",
    "however , both quantities are depleted due to the localization of fragmented condensates in the local disorder potential minima . for a strong enough disorder in a homogeneous system ,",
    "the depletion increases to such an extent that even a critical disorder strength exists , above which a bose - glass phase appears , consisting only of localized mini - condensates @xcite .",
    "effects of disorder were also studied for harmonically trapped becs @xcite and becs in optical lattices @xcite , while the temperature behavior of dirty boson properties was examined in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "realization of atomic dipolar becs @xcite with long - range anisotropic interaction has generated large interest in the theory of dipolar quantum gases @xcite .",
    "increase in the strength of dipolar interaction is possible by substituting atoms with magnetic dipoles by heteronuclear molecules , which have a strong electric dipolar moment in rovibrational ground state @xcite , or by inducing radiative coupling by placing dipoles into a resonator @xcite .",
    "dipolar condensates were studied in the case of isotropic disorder @xcite , which yields characteristic anisotropies for both the superfluid density and the sound velocity at zero temperature due to the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction . although a 3d isotropic laser speckle potential has recently been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the typical disorder realized in experiments is cylindrically symmetric and , to the best of our knowledge , it has so far been examined only numerically for contact interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , motivated by the experiments with dipolar becs in anisotropic disorder potentials , we develop in this paper a mean - field theory and analytically study the impact of a weak anisotropic disorder on physical properties of a polarized dipolar bec at zero temperature .    to this end",

    "[ sec : con ] we present our conclusions and outlook for further related research .",
    "finally , the appendix gives analytical results for the condensate depletion and the disorder correction to the chemical potential , while the supplemental material @xcite gives complete analytical results for the disorder correction of both the superfluid density and the sound velocity for the general case of a bec with contact and dipole - dipole interaction in an anisotropic , lorentzian - correlated disorder .",
    "bogoliubov quasiparticles and disorder induced fluctuations decouple in the lowest order @xcite , suggesting that disorder corrections can be calculated at zero temperature by neglecting quantum fluctuations and using a mean - field macroscopic wave function @xmath0 governed by the time - independent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation : @xmath1 here @xmath2 stands for the particle mass , @xmath3 denotes the chemical potential , @xmath4 represents an arbitrary two - body potential , while @xmath5 describes an external disorder potential .",
    "denoting the disorder ensemble average as @xmath6 , a homogeneous disordered system can be described , without any loss of generality , by a vanishing mean value @xmath7 and an arbitrary correlation function @xmath8 in this section we present in detail a perturbative theory , which was developed earlier in ref .",

    "the range of validity of this perturbation theory is limited by standard requirements for a mean - field approach : dilute , weakly - interacting bec at low temperatures , when quantum fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "the perturbation expansion is performed with respect to the disorder strength , thus the disorder potential has to be sufficiently small compared to the chemical potential , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "we start with the observation that the gp eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) represents a stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation , where the statistics of the condensate wave function @xmath0 is governed by the statistics of the disorder potential @xmath5 @xcite . since @xmath10 describes the macroscopic occupation of the ground state , we assume it to be real without loss of generality .",
    "in addition to the statistical properties of the random potential we will also assume that the macroscopic value of some physical quantity @xmath11 , obtained by coarse - graining of a microscopic quantity @xmath12 over a large volume @xmath13 , gives the same result as the disorder ensemble average , namely : @xmath14 here the length of the coarse - graining @xmath15 is assumed to be larger than both the correlation length @xmath16 of the disorder potential @xmath5 , and the healing length @xmath17 , which represents the characteristic distance at which the condensate wave - function responds to some perturbation in the external potential : @xmath18 in the definition of the healing length @xmath19 represents the density of the fluid and @xmath20 denotes the strength of the short - range interaction part of the two - particle interaction potential @xmath21 , expressed in terms of the s - wave scattering length @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the case of a sufficiently small random potential @xmath23 , when the perturbative decomposition of the wave function of the system is justified : @xmath24 where @xmath25 corresponds to the correction of the wave function of order @xmath26 in the disorder .",
