    "besides the immediate consequences this result has for our understanding of the superconductivity in the doped fullerides , it should also have quite general implications for the physics of systems close to a mott transition .",
    "we start by introducing the model hamiltonian used to describe the doped fullerenes .",

    "fullerites are crystals made of c@xmath1 molecules on an fcc lattice .",
    "they are characterized by very weak inter - molecular interactions .",
    "therefore the discrete molecular levels merely broaden into narrow , well separated bands @xcite .",

    "they do not affect the band structure around the fermi energy very much .",
    "only the filling of the @xmath3 band changes , since each alkali atom donates its valence electron .",
    "hence for k@xmath0c@xmath1 the ( 3-fold degenerate ) @xmath3 band is half - filled .",
    "we are mainly interested in the properties of these valence - band electrons . to simplify the description we therefore want to get rid of the other bands .",
    "they can be projected out by the lwdin downfolding technique @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to partition the hilbert space into a subspace that contains the degrees of freedom that we are interested in ( in our case the ` @xmath3-subspace ' ) and the rest of the hilbert space : @xmath4 . we can then write the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projection of the hamiltonian onto subspace @xmath7 , while the @xmath8 @xmath9 contain the hybridization matrix elements between the two subspaces . writing green s function @xmath10 in the same way",

    "a realistic description of the electrons in the @xmath3 band also has to include the correlation effects which come from the coulomb repulsion of electrons in @xmath3 orbitals on the same molecule .",

    "it is important to avoid double counting in the calculation of @xmath23 .",
    "while the relaxation of the occupied orbitals and the polarization of neighboring molecules have to be included in the calculation , excitations within the @xmath3 band must be excluded , since they are contained explicitly in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .",

    "multiplet effects are not included , since they tend to be counteracted by the jahn - teller effect , which is also neglected .",
    "in k@xmath0c@xmath1 the system has three electrons per molecule . in the limit of weak correlations ( @xmath27 )",
    ", this corresponds to a metal with a half - filled conduction band . in the atomic limit ( @xmath28 )",
    "the coulomb energy dominates , forcing every molecule to be occupied by exactly three electrons , and suppressing any hopping .",
    "this is a mott insulator .",
    "we therefore expect a metal - insulator transition for some finite value of the coulomb interaction @xmath23 . for the model hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) with parameters describing k@xmath0c@xmath1",
    "it occurs for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "given the estimates for the true value of @xmath23 , k@xmath0c@xmath1 is therefore close to the mott transition , in a correlated metallic state .",
    "we now investigate how efficient the screening is in a strongly correlated system like k@xmath0c@xmath1 . to be specific we analyze how a test charge @xmath30 sitting on one molecule is screened by the conduction electrons in the @xmath3 band . to describe the influence of the test charge situated on the molecule at site @xmath31 we include an additional term @xmath32 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) . determining the electron density at site @xmath31 for the system without test charge and for the system with a finite @xmath30 we find the screening @xmath33    let s first discuss the screening in the rpa . in the random phase approximation it only costs kinetic energy to screen the test charge . in the limit where a typical coulomb integral @xmath23 is large compared with the band width @xmath34",
    ", the kinetic energy cost of screening is relatively small compared with the potential energy gain .",
    "therefore , within the random phase approximation , the screening is very efficient for large @xmath23 .",
    "this means that as the test charge @xmath30 is introduced , almost the same amount of electronic charge moves away from the site : @xmath35 for large @xmath23 ( see fig .  [ extrapolate ] ) .",
    "the random phase approximation neglects , however , that when an electron leaves a site it has to find another site with a missing electron or there is an increase in coulomb energy of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "thus the rpa is accurate for small values of @xmath36 , while it is _ qualitatively wrong _ for large @xmath36 .",
    "it is not clear what happens when coulomb energy @xmath23 and band width @xmath34 are comparable .    to address this question we have performed quantum monte carlo calculations for the combined hamiltonian @xmath37 since we are interested in the linear response , we should calculate the effect of an infinitesimally small test charge @xmath30 . because of the statistical error in a monte carlo calculation it is , however , difficult to determine the response to a small perturbation . to get a good signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we would therefore like to use as large a test charge as possible . to estimate how large we can make @xmath30 and still be in the linear response regime",
    ", we have performed lanczos calculations for a small system of 4 molecules , where exact calculations are possible .",
    "checking the response for different test charges we find that for @xmath38 the response is practically linear .",
    "the quantum monte carlo calculations were then performed for large clusters of @xmath3932 , 48 , 64 , 72 , and 108 molecules , corresponding to systems with 96 , 144 , 192 , 216 , and 324 electrons , and @xmath40 . to extrapolate the results @xmath41 to infinite systems size we used a finite - size scaling of the form @xmath42 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ extrapolate ] .",
    "for rather small values of @xmath36 ( @xmath43 ) , the rpa somewhat underestimates the screening .",
    "such a behavior is also found in the electron gas @xcite . for intermediate values of @xmath36 ( @xmath44 )",
    "the rpa gives surprisingly accurate results . for larger",
    "@xmath36 the screening rapidly breaks down , and the rpa becomes qualitatively wrong , as discussed above .",
    "the efficient screening almost up to the mott transition which occurs for @xmath45 @xcite has profound implications for the superconductivity in the alkali doped fullerenes",
    ". we will only give qualitative arguments here , a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite . in bcs theory",
    "the superconducting transition temperature is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 describes the electron ",
    "phonon coupling , which mediates the effective electron ",
    "electron attraction , @xmath48 is the coulomb pseudopotential that describes the repulsive coulomb interaction between electrons , and @xmath49 is the density of states at the fermi energy . since the electrons couple to intramolecular phonons ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath50 is to a good approximation a molecular property . therefore increasing the density of states",
    "@xmath49 will increase the electron  phonon coupling @xmath51 .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the lattice constant of the solid fullerene .",
    "taking the c@xmath1 molecules further apart will decrease the hopping matrix elements @xmath26 thus narrowing the @xmath3 band and correspondingly increasing the density of states .",
    "if also @xmath52 was a molecular quantity , i.e.  independent of the lattice constant , and if @xmath53 which , of course , is the prerequisite for superconductivity , then according to ( [ tc ] ) increasing the lattice constant would raise @xmath54 .",
    "such a variation of the transition temperature with the lattice constant is indeed found experimentally @xcite . here",
    "the variation of the lattice constant @xmath55 is achieved by applying hydrostatic pressure ( to reduce @xmath55 ) or by using larger alkali metals like rb and cs to increase the lattice constant compared to k@xmath0c@xmath1 ( chemical pressure ) .",
    "this suggests that by inserting even more bulky ions or molecules , like nh@xmath0 , into the doped fullerenes , could be increase @xmath54 even further .",
    "as it turns out , however , @xmath54 rapidly _ decreases _ with @xmath55 when the lattice constant becomes too large , and eventually superconductivity disappears .",
    "this drop in @xmath54 can be understood as a natural consequence of the breakdown of the screening close to the mott transition . in the doped fullerenes @xmath52",
    "is essentially given by @xmath56 , where @xmath23 is the unscreened coulomb matrix element ( cf .",
    "the interaction term in the hamiltonian ) and @xmath57 describes the screening by the @xmath3 electrons .",
    "@xmath23 is practically independent of the lattice constant , while the screening efficiency changes with the band width as shown in fig .",
    "[ extrapolate ] .",
    "for @xmath36 in the region @xmath58 the screening is almost rpa - like and does not vary very much , which means that in this region @xmath52 is almost independent of the lattice constant @xmath55 .",
    "in this region @xmath54 thus increases with @xmath55 . for even smaller band width , or correspondingly larger lattice constants ,",
    "the screening rapidly becomes inefficient .",
    "now @xmath52 increases with the lattice constant , leading to a decrease of @xmath59 .",
    "hence for @xmath55 too large , @xmath54 rapidly decreases with @xmath55 and eventually vanishes .",
    "since the screening only breaks down close to the metal - insulator transition , we have the interesting situation that _ @xmath54 peaks close to a mott transition ! _    the efficient screening found in the monte carlo calculations also explains why the coupling to the alkali - phonons is weak .",
    "each c@xmath1 molecule is surrounded by 14 alkali ions with very weak force constants .",
    "when an electron arrives on a molecule one would therefore expect that the surrounding alkali ions respond strongly .",
    "this was , however , not confirmed by experiment @xcite .",
    "that result can be naturally understood as an effect of the efficient screening : when an electron arrives on a molecule other electrons leave , effectively leaving the molecule almost neutral .",
    "the alkali ions then only see a small change in the net charge and therefore respond weakly , leading to a small electron  phonon coupling . but being molecular crystals , doped fullerenes also have intramolecular phonons .",
    "some of those intramolecular phonons shift the @xmath3 levels in such a way that the center of gravity of the energy levels is not changed .",
    "these are the modes that are not screened by the transfer of charged .",
    "they are therefore the modes that drive superconductivity in the fullerides .",
    "we now turn to the question of how the results shown in fig .",
    "[ extrapolate ] were obtained . to keep the notation simple",
    "we will discuss the different methods for a simple hubbard model ( only one orbital per site , next neighbor hopping matrix elements @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 the generalization to hamiltonians like ( [ hamil ] ) is straightforward .",
    "the first step in the quantum monte carlo approach is to identify a trial function @xmath62 . for the hubbard model that function should balance the opposing tendencies of the hopping term and the interaction : without interaction ( i.e.  for @xmath27 ) the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) is the slater determinant @xmath63 that maximizes the kinetic energy . without hopping ( @xmath64 ) the interaction",
    "is minimized . since only doubly occupied sites , i.e.  sites with @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,",
    "contribute to the coulomb energy , the electrons are distributed as uniformly as possible over the lattice to minimize the number of double occupancies . a good compromise between these two extremes",
    "is to start from the non - interacting wavefunction @xmath63 but reduce the weight of configurations @xmath67 with large double occupancies @xmath68 .",
    "this leads ( up to normalization ) to the gutzwiller wavefunction @xcite : @xmath69 with @xmath70 $ ] the gutzwiller parameter . in configuration space",
    "the coulomb term in the hamiltonian is given by @xmath71 .",
    "thus the gutzwiller factor reflects the interaction term in the hubbard hamiltonian . in this spirit",
    "we can also construct trial functions for hamiltonians with additional terms like the screening hamiltonian ( [ scrhamil ] ) .",
    "we add a second gutzwiller factor that reflects the interaction with the test charge @xmath72 : @xmath73 changing the additional gutzwiller factor @xmath74 we can vary the occupation of the site with the test charge .",
    "since the gutzwiller factor , like the interaction term , is diagonal in configuration space , we have to perform a sum over all configurations @xmath67 in order to calculate the energy expectation value for a gutzwiller wavefunction : @xmath75 where we have introduced the local energy for a configuration @xmath67 @xmath76 since the number of configurations @xmath67 grows exponentially with system - size , the summations in ( [ evar ] ) can only be done explicitly for very small systems . for larger problems we use variational monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the idea is to perform a random walk in the space of configurations , with transition probabilities @xmath77 chosen such that the configurations @xmath78 in the random walk have the probability distribution function @xmath79 . then @xmath80 the transition probabilities can be determined from detailed balance @xmath81 which is fulfilled by the choice @xmath82 $ ] , with @xmath83 being the maximum number of possible transitions .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only transitions between configurations that are connected by the hamiltonian , i.e.  transitions in which one electron hops to a neighboring site .",
    "the standard prescription is then to propose a transition @xmath84 with probability @xmath85 and accept it with probability @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "this works well for @xmath23 not too large . for strongly correlated systems , however , the random walk will stay for long times in configurations with a small number of double occupancies @xmath68 , since most of the proposed moves will increase @xmath87 and hence be rejected with probability @xmath88 .",
    "there is , however , a way to integrate - out the time the walk stays in a given configuration . to see how , we first observe that for the local energy ( [ eloc ] ) the ratio of the wavefunctions for all transitions induced by the hamiltonian have to be calculated .",
    "this in turn means that we also know all transition probabilities @xmath77 .",
    "we can therefore eliminate any rejection ( i.e.  accept with probability one ) by proposing moves with probabilities @xmath89 checking detailed balance ( [ detailedbalance ] ) we find that now we are sampling configurations @xmath90 from the probability distribution function @xmath91 . to compensate for this we assign a weight @xmath92 to each configuration @xmath67 .",
    "the energy expectation value is then given by @xmath93 the above method is quite efficient since it ensures that in every monte carlo step a new configuration is created .",
    "instead of staying in a configuration where @xmath62 is large , this configuration is weighted with the expectation value of the number of steps the simple metropolis algorithm would stay there .",
    "this is particularly convenient for simulations of systems with strong correlations : instead of having to do longer and longer runs as @xmath23 is increased , the above method produces , for a fixed number of monte carlo steps , results with comparable error estimates .",
    "so far we have only specified the form of the trial function @xmath62 .",
    "the goal of a variational calculation is now to identify the parameters that result in the best trial function .",
    "a criterion for a good trial function is e.g.  a low variational energy . to find the wavefunction that minimizes the variational energy we could perform independent vmc calculations for a set of different trial functions .",
    "it is , however , difficult to compare the energies from these calculations since each vmc result comes with its own statistical errors .",
    "this problem can be avoided with correlated sampling @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use the same random walk for calculating the expectation value of all the different trial functions .",
    "this reduces the _ relative _ errors and hence makes it easier to find the minimum .",
    "let us assume we have generated a random walk @xmath78 using @xmath62 as the trial function .",
    "using the same random walk , we can then estimate the energy expectation value ( [ evmc ] ) for a different trial function @xmath94 , by introducing the reweighting factors @xmath95 : @xmath96 with @xmath97    we notice that ( also in @xmath98 ) the new trial function @xmath94 appears only in ratios with the old @xmath62 . for trial functions ( [ gwf ] ) that differ only in the gutzwiller factor",
    "this means that the slater determinants cancel , leaving only powers @xmath99 . since @xmath68 is _",
    "integer _ we can then rearrange the sums in ( [ corrsmpl ] ) into polynomials in @xmath100 . to find the optimal gutzwiller parameter",
    "we then pick a reasonable @xmath101 , perform a vmc run for @xmath102 during which we also estimate the coefficients for these polynomials .",
    "we can then calculate @xmath103 by simply evaluating the ratio of the polynomials .",
    "since there are typically only of the order of some ten non - vanishing coefficients this method is very efficient .",
    "the idea of rewriting the sum over configurations into a polynomial can be easily generalized to trial functions with more correlation factors of the type @xmath104 , as long as the correlation function @xmath105 is integer - valued on the space of configurations . as a specific example of how the method works in practice , fig .",
    "[ screen ] shows the result of a correlated sampling run for the trial function ( [ scrwf ] ) .",
    "diffusion monte carlo @xcite allows us , in principle , to sample the true ground state of a hamiltonian .",

    "there is no time - step error involved .",
    "because of the prohibitively large dimension of the many - body hilbert space , the matrix - vector product in ( [ proj ] ) can not be done exactly .",
    "instead , we rewrite the equation in configuration space @xmath111 and perform the propagation in a stochastic sense : @xmath112 is represented by an ensemble of configurations @xmath67 with weights @xmath113 .",
    "the transition matrix element @xmath114 is rewritten as a transition probability @xmath77 times a normalization factor @xmath115 .",
    "the iteration ( [ iter ] ) is then stochastically performed as follows : for each @xmath67 we pick a new configuration @xmath116 with probability @xmath77 and multiply its weight by @xmath115 .",
    "then the new ensemble of configurations @xmath116 with their respective weights represents @xmath117 .",
    "importance sampling decisively improves the efficiency of this process by replacing @xmath114 with @xmath118 , so that transitions from configurations where the trial function is small to configurations with large trial function are enhanced : @xmath119 now the ensemble of configurations represents the product @xmath120 . after a large number @xmath18 of iterations the ground state energy",
    "is then given by the mixed estimator @xmath121 as long as the evolution operator has only non - negative matrix elements @xmath122 , all weights @xmath113 will be positive . if , however , @xmath11 has negative matrix elements there will be both configurations with positive and negative weight .",
    "their contributions to the estimator ( [ mixedest ] ) tend to cancel so that eventually the statistical error dominates , rendering the simulation useless .",
    "this is the infamous sign problem .",
    "a straightforward way to get rid of the sign problem is to remove the offending matrix elements from the hamiltonian , thus defining a new hamiltonian @xmath123 by @xmath124 for each off - diagonal element @xmath125 that has been removed , a term is added to the diagonal : @xmath126 this is the fixed - node approximation for lattice hamiltonians @xcite .",

    "fixed - node diffusion monte carlo for a lattice hamiltonian thus means that we choose a trial function from which we construct an effective hamiltonian and determine its ground state by diffusion monte carlo .",
    "because of the variational property , we want to pick the @xmath62 such that @xmath129 is minimized , i.e. we want to optimize the trial function , or , equivalently , the effective hamiltonian . also here",
    "we can use the concept of correlated sampling .",
    "for optimizing the gutzwiller parameter @xmath101 we can even exploit the idea of rewriting the correlated sampling sums into polynomials in @xmath100 , that we already have introduced in vmc .",
    "there is , however , a problem arising from the fact that the weight of a given configuration @xmath130 in iteration @xmath18 is given by the product @xmath131 .",
    "each individual normalization factor @xmath115 can be written as a finite polynomial , but the order of the polynomial for @xmath132 increases steadily with the number of iterations .",

    "<S> we study the static screening in a hubbard - like model using fixed - node diffusion monte carlo . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the random phase approximation is surprisingly accurate even for metallic systems close to the mott transition . as a specific application we discuss the implications of the efficient screening for the superconductivity in the doped fullerenes . in the monte carlo calculations we use trial functions with two gutzwiller - type parameters . </S>",
    "<S> to deal with such trial functions , we introduce a method for efficiently optimizing the gutzwiller parameters , both in variational and in fixed - node diffusion monte carlo . </S>"
