    "detection of optical emission on and before gamma - ray burst ( grb ) triggers provide us knowledge of gamma - ray emission mechanism at early stage of an ejecta expansion from a massive star explosion .",
    "the optical flash can be produced by a reverse shock in the ejecta @xcite , or produced from loaded electron - positron plasma by prompt gamma - ray emission@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "although there is much effort to search such prompt optical emission from grb , only one flash has been detected as far ; during the grb 990123 was active , very bright optical flash was observed by rotse - i telescope at 8.9@xmath3 magnitude about 50 seconds after the burst trigger @xcite .",
    "recently several groups are developing and operating wide - field telescopes for hunting the optical flashes ; _",
    "e.g. _ raptor @xcite , bootes @xcite , ashra @xcite , wfoc @xcite , @xmath4 of the sky @xcite and so on .",
    "we also started construction of a wide - field telescope named _ widget _ ( wide - field telescope for grb early timing ) in late 2003 .",
    "the _ widget _ telescope consists of an _ apogee _ alta u10 ccd camera and a 24 mm f/1.4 _ canon _ ef wide - angle lens .",
    "the u10 camera uses a 2048 @xmath1 2048 format _",
    "thx7899 ccd chip with 14-micron pixels .",
    "the chip is front - illuminated type with quantum efficiency of 38% at 720 nm .",
    "the camera provides a @xmath0 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "electronics onboard the ccd camera have been optimized to provide fast readout of the entire array in 5 seconds with a 16 bit ad converter through an usb2.0 serial line .",
    "the standard exposure in our operation is 5 seconds , so that we take sky images every 10 seconds .",
    "the optics and the ccd camera are attached to a _",
    "njp temma-2 polar mount .",
    "the mount is capable of slewing at a speed of about 90 arcmin / sec .",
    "it is controlled by an pc running linux os via a serial line .",
    "the telescope , related computers and electronics are housed inside the hut whose roof is sliding to one direction .",
    "it is custom build by _ human comm co. ltd . _ the height and width are 2 meters , and the length is 3 meters ( see figure [ fig : widget ] ) .",
    "control of the roof is provided by relay boards attached on a side - wall of the hut .",
    "the relay boards accept commands via a socket connection from a control pc running linux . the roof is opened and closed according to a preplanned schedule . in case of rain the roof is closed by a circuit connecting to weather stations located outside the hut .",
    "when a power outage occurs , the roof is automatically closed by weight of some steel bars without any electrical power .",
    "the timing of the whole system is provided by a network timing protocol ( ntp ) server and a radio clock with an average error less than 1 second .          on a side .",

    "the site was used for the air shower experiment , akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) @xcite .",
    "since we design the system for fully automatic operation , almost all of the devices are robust against software errors , hardware failures , or network troubles .",
    "we started observations at the site in june 2004 , and established the fully automatic operation in september 2004 .",
    "the station is currently unmanned except for regular maintenance .",
    "astrometric and photometric calibrations are based on the standard stars in the tycho catalog @xcite . for calibration and monitoring of data quality",
    ", we uses more than 10 well calibrated standard stars .",
    "the limiting magnitude is about @xmath5 for 5 seconds exposure and @xmath6 for 30 seconds exposure with s / n=3 at the akeno observing site .",
    "the limiting magnitude is somewhat reduced when the moon is in the fov .",
    "stability of the magnitude of a star measured by the photometry is about @xmath7 in a night .    because of the optics distortion",
    ", we can not simply fit a celestial coordinate to the whole image . to reduce the distortion effect , we restrict the field for astrometry in the @xmath8 region which enclose the grb position reported by a satellite or ground based observations . as the result",
    ", we set the astrometric precision about 1.5 arcseconds even around the edge of the _ widget _ fov .",
    "since the precision is well below a size of one pixel , we can identify the position of grbs on the chip without any ambiguity .",
    "since june 2004 where we started scientific operation , we have carried out six coincident observations with _",
    "position alerts listed on the table [ tab : grb_detection ] .",
    "unfortunately , we missed all of the chances due to 2004 s bad weather condistions in japan .",
    "we continue the automatic observation when it is fine .",
    "about five coincident observations are estimated per year under clear sky .",
    "we are extending the system in early 2005 for the _ swift _ era .",
    "one of the extensions is to add three more telescopes on the mount .",
    "totally four telescopes cover the larger sky area of about @xmath9 which is fair part of the _ swift _ fov .",
    "the other option is to add some bandpass filters for measuring color variation of the grb optical flashes .",
    "although the present system is not capable of mounting the filters , we can install them by remodeling of the camera attachment .",
    "we expects that the color variation will probably tell us physical conditions or origin of the optical flashes .",
    "the other extension is to add three polarized filters with polarization angles of 0@xmath10 , 60@xmath10 , and 120@xmath10 for measuring polarization of the optical transients .",
    "high liner polarization in the optical flashes may be detected in some grbs@xcite .",
