    "mean - field ( mf ) theories provide us with a basic tool to study nuclear structure from nucleonic degrees of freedom . however , it is yet difficult to reproduce structure of medium- to heavy - mass nuclei with the bare nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction to good accuracy , and most of the mf calculations have been performed with phenomenologically determined effective interactions ( or energy density functionals ) .",
    "the michigan 3-range yukawa ( m3y ) interaction  @xcite was obtained by fitting the yukawa functions to brueckner s @xmath1-matrix . as the crucial role of the chiral symmetry breaking has been recognized , it is desirable to take into account the pionic effects in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the m3y interaction contains the central part of the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) and the tensor part that is corrected due to the medium effects as well as to the @xmath2-meson exchange .",
    "the author has developed _ semi - realistic _ effective @xmath0 interactions  @xcite , by modifying the m3y interaction so as to reproduce the saturation properties and the @xmath3 splitting while keeping the central part of the opep .",
    "the tensor channels have been pointed out to be significant in the @xmath4- or @xmath5-dependence of the shell structure  @xcite .",
    "we have obtained parameter - sets in which the tensor channels are maintained ( _ e.g. _ the set m3y - p5 ) , and one in which the tensor channels are dropped ( m3y - p4 )  @xcite . by implementing mf calculations , it has been shown that semi - realistic interactions could give different shell structure from the widely used skyrme and gogny interactions , and that of the semi - realistic interaction including the tensor channels is often favorable if compared to the experimental data .",
    "significance of the tensor channels in the magnetic excitations has also been confirmed  @xcite via calculations in the random - phase approximation .",
    "the parameter - sets developed in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained by fitting them to pairing properties , as well as to data of doubly magic nuclei . however , in the calculations of finite nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite , influence of the density - dependent contact force on the pairing was not fully taken into account . because we find that this influence is not negligibly small , we propose modified parameter - sets in this report , which will be useful in future studies of nuclear structure .",
    "the new parameter - sets are refitted to the same quantities as the old ones , as will be described in the subsequent section .",
    "we consider the effective @xmath0 interaction that has the following form , @xmath6^{\\alpha^{(\\mathrm{se } ) } }   + t_\\rho^{(\\mathrm{te } ) } p_\\mathrm{te}\\cdot   [ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_i)]^{\\alpha^{(\\mathrm{te})}}\\big )   \\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_{ij})\\ , , \\label{eq : effint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 representing the indices of nucleons , and @xmath11 denotes the nucleon density . @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the projection operators on the singlet - even ( se ) , triplet - even ( te ) , singlet - odd ( so ) and triplet - odd ( to ) two - particle states .",

    "the non - central channels @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not changed ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 of m3y - p4@xmath21 ( m3y - p5@xmath21 ) are identical to those of m3y - p4 ( m3y - p5 )  @xcite .",
    "the m3y - p5@xmath21 interaction has @xmath23 determined from the @xmath1-matrix  @xcite , while @xmath24 is assumed in m3y - p4@xmath21 .",
    "not displayed in table  [ tab : param_m3y ] , the longest range ( @xmath25 ) part of @xmath26 is kept to be @xmath27 ( the central channels of the opep ) .",
    "the other strength parameters are fitted to the measured binding energies of @xmath28o and @xmath29pb and to the even - odd mass differences of the sn isotopes , in the hartree - fock ( hf ) or the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) approximation .",
    "compared to the old sets m3y - p4 and p5 , in m3y - p4@xmath21 and p5@xmath21 the se channel is more attractive below the saturation density , and its influence on the saturation and the symmetry energies is compensated by the other central channels .",
