    "accretion rates are usually larger than @xmath8 and , as a result , only about a third of non - magnetic systems are dwarf novae .",
    "the situation is completely different below the period gap , where dwarf novae dominate the cv population @xcite .",
    "dwarf novae provide the best environment to develop and test our understanding of accretion disc structure and dynamics , which is relevant to a wide range of objects , such as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs , * ? ? ?",

    ", the masses and temperatures of the component stars and the radial structure of the accretion disc can be determined to high precision , through studies of the eclipse features of the white dwarf , the bright spot ( formed in the region where the mass - transferring stream meets the accretion disc ) and accretion disc components ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "photometric observations soon revealed the eclipsing nature of the system and also frequently occuring outbursts .",
    "an interesting historic note is that @xcite mentioned short - term variability of , which correspondingly was included in the new catalogue of suspected variable stars as nsv14581 ( though with rather uncertain coordinates ) .",
    "we obtained photometric and spectroscopic data on using both large aperture ( @xmath13 ) and small aperture telescopes .",
    "table[tab : jobs ] summarizes the observations conducted with the former . a brief account on data reduction follows .",
    "we obtained time - series photometry of  during 17 nights throughout the period 2003 to 2007 using 1.22.5 m telescopes ( table[tab : jobs ] ) .",
    "these observations were reduced with the pipeline described in @xcite , which employs bias - subtraction and flat - fielding in the standard fashion within midas and uses sextractor @xcite to perform aperture photometry .",
    "sample light curves are shown in fig.[fig : slc ] .    has been found to vary in brightness between @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitude .",
    "eclipses are shallow and maintain an almost constant depth , during the rise to outburst .",
    "the eclipses in the bright state exhibit a symmetric u - shape , typical for an accretion disc - dominated system . during quiescence",
    "the eclipse morphology becomes more complicated and reveals several breaks in slope .",
    "in addition to eclipses , the light curve of  displays two further features : short - term , random , out - of - eclipse variations , known as `` flickering '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an `` orbital hump '' , a brightening just before the start of the eclipse attributed to the bright spot coming into view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an intensive 1.5-month - long photometric campaign was conducted in 2009 to characterise the outburst behaviour of , using small aperture ( 11``-14 '' ) telescopes .",
    "the data were reduced with aip4win and maximdl , and the resulting light curve is shown in fig.[fig : outburst ] .",
    "spectroscopic observations during the system s quiescence were obtained at the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona .",
    "the modular spectrograph and a site 2048@xmath16 pixel ccd yielded 2 / pixel and from 4210 to 7500  but with decreased sensitivity toward the ends of the wavelength range .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath17  full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "reductions were performed mostly with standard ` iraf ` routines , but we used an original implementation of the optimal extraction algorithm detailed by @xcite to compute one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimensional images . for wavelength calibration , we used a dispersion curve derived from lamp exposures in twilight , and corrected for nighttime drifts using the @xmath18 sky line .",
    "we observed standard stars in twilight whenever the sky appeared clear , and used these observations to flux - calibrate the data .",
    "the scatter of the standard stars typically suggests that the flux calibration is uncertain by several tenths of a magnitude , probably due to uncalibrated losses at the spectrograph slit .",
    "the mean quiescent spectrum is shown in fig.[fig : decomp ] .",
    "the flux level of the observed spectrum implies a @xmath19-band magnitude near 17.0 , subject to the calibration uncertainties .",
    "mid - eclipse times ( given in table[tab : mideclt ] ) were determined by visually cross - correlating each eclipse profile with its mirror image with respect to time .",
    "this was found to produce more robust results than fitting a parabola to the eclipse minimum , in particular for the light curves with poor time resolution .",
    "we adopted the duty cycle ( exposure plus readout time ) of the corresponding observations as a conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the mid - eclipse times .",
    "fitting a linear ephemeris to the mid - eclipse times gives    @xmath20    with mid - eclipse times calculated on a utc timescale , i.e. an orbital period of @xmath0 .",
    "as is typical for quiescent dwarf novae , the balmer lines in emission are the most prominent features in the spectrum of with equivalent widths of @xmath21 and @xmath22  for h@xmath23 and h@xmath1 respectively .",
    "hei emission is detected at 4921 , 5015 , and 5876  , and feii @xmath24 as well ( the features at @xmath25 4921 and 5015 may also be blended with feii ) .",
    "the absorption bands of an m - dwarf companion are conspicuous . to quantify the m dwarf contribution , we subtracted library spectra of m dwarfs classified by @xcite , taken with the same instrument , and varied the spectral type and scaling until the m - dwarf features were cancelled as well as possible .",
    "the lower two traces in fig.[fig : decomp ] show the decomposition that was ( at least subjectively ) the best . from this exercise , we estimate that the companion is of type @xmath26 subclasses , and that its flux corresponds to @xmath27 ( external error , including calibration uncertainties ) . the spectral type - period relation of @xcite ( equation4 in their paper ) for @xmath28 yields sp2=m1.5 for the derived orbital period of @xmath29 , a value broadly consistent with our estimate of @xmath26 , as the rms scatter of the spectral type - period relation is 3 subtypes for @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we measured radial velocities of the h@xmath1 emission line using a double - gaussian convolution method outlined by @xcite ; the centres of the gaussians were separated by @xmath30 , and each individual gaussian had a fwhm of @xmath31 , comparable to our spectral resolution .",
    "this emphasised the outer wings of the line profile .",
    "we also tried a range of separations , and found that the radial velocity amplitude and phase were insensitive to this parameter . to measure the velocity of the m - dwarf component",
    ", we used the cross - correlation program ` rvsao ` , written by @xcite . for the template",
    ", we used a velocity - compensated composite m - dwarf spectrum , composed by summing the spectra of a large number of m dwarfs for which @xcite tabulate precise velocities .",
    "the cross - correlation region was from 6000 to 6500  ; this was chosen to include some strong atomic and tio features , while avoiding emission lines .",
    "not all the spectra gave usable cross - correlation velocities ; we limited our analysis to those for which the formal velocity error was less than @xmath32 .",
    "we then performed fits to the radial velocities ( both absorption and h@xmath1 emission ) , of the form @xmath33.$ ] the orbital period was held fixed to the value derived from eclipses . because of the modest number of absorption velocities and their limited phase coverage , and because the absorption should trace the motion of the secondary star fairly well , we fixed @xmath34 to the mid - eclipse ephemeris when fitting the absorption velocities , but left it as a free parameter for the h@xmath1 emission ones .",
    "the resulting velocities were @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 for the absorption and emission lines respectively , with the numbers in parentheses indicating the errors .",
    "figure[fig : folpl ] shows the emission and absorption velocities as a function of orbital phase , while fig.[fig : singletrail ] shows a greyscale representation of the low - state spectra , as a function of phase .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[fig : singletrail ] is scaled to emphasize the m - dwarf absorption features , and to show the structure in the hei @xmath39 line ; the orbital motion of the m dwarf is clearly seen .",
    "the scaling of the lower panel brings out the complex structure in the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "we can estimate the distance to  using the secondary star s contribution to the spectrum and our knowledge of the orbital period . for a secondary star of mass at a fixed",
    ", the roche lobe radius @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath41 , and is almost independent of the primary mass @xcite .",
    "we do not know , but we can estimate it using evolutionary models tabulated by @xcite ; these suggest that the secondary is between 0.23 and 0.56 . at this , eq.1 of @xcite",
    "then implies @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite tabulate absolute magnitudes and radii for late type dwarfs as a function of spectral class , which implies a surface brightness for each star . in the range of spectral type",
    "we see here , these correspond to @xmath43 for a @xmath44 star , where the uncertainty includes both the spectral type uncertainty and the scatter among the tabulated points . combining this with the radius yields an estimate of @xmath45 for the secondary .",
    "the galactic coordinates of  are @xmath46 ; at this location , @xcite estimate @xmath47 to the edge of the galaxy . assuming that our object lies outside most of the dust , and taking the m - dwarf contribution to the spectrum as @xmath48 then yields an extinction - corrected distance modulus of @xmath49 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath4 pc .",
    "note carefully that this estimate makes no assumption that the secondary follows a main - sequence mass - radius relation ; it assumes only that the secondary s spectral type is a reliable guide to its surface brightness , and that it fills its roche lobe .",
    "we intensively monitored  for about 50 days , starting from the 1st of april 2009 using small aperture telescopes .",
    "four outbursts have been recorded during this period , indicating a recurrence time of @xmath5 .",
    "prominent in fig.[fig : outburst ] is a `` long '' outburst , lasting @xmath50 , followed by a seemingly `` short '' outburst .",
    "this could be a hint towards a bimodal distribution of the outburst duration , observed in many dwarf novae ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further observations are required to establish a more accurate recurrence time and to check the consistency of the `` long '' and `` short '' outburst succession .",
    "we have inspected v7.12 ( 2009 ) of the ritter and kolb catalogue @xcite and compiled a list of ugem - type dwarf novae ( ug ) and zcam - type stars ( zc ) that are found in the range @xmath51 . only systems with confirmed ug / zc status and with a quoted outburst recurrence period were considered .",
    "this left us with a list of 22 systems ( out of the 39 listed in r&k in this range ) . in this list zc systems",
    "dominate the short end of the outburst recurrence period distribution ( @xmath52 ) , while ug systems tend to have longer intervals between outbursts ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "our inferred outburst recurrence period places  in the zc region .",
    "however , as there has been no recorded standstill ( the hallmark of zc systems ) , its identification as either a ug or a zc remains ambiguous .",
    "the standard treatment of eclipsing cvs ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) involves the identification of the contact points of the white dwarf , the bright spot and the accretion disc .",
    "the corresponding phase - widths are then used to place firm ( geometrical ) constraints on the mass ratio @xmath54 and the inclination angle @xmath55 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and deduce information about the extend and location of the bright spot and the size of the accretion disc .",
    "flickering can hinder attempts to identify the contact points .",
    "averaging together many light curves is an often applied solution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of ippeg ) .",
    "although breaks in slope are seen in the light curve of , the available data set is not of sufficient quality and time - resolution to unambiguously identify the different contact points .",
    "hence , the exact eclipse geometry of remains unclear .    in an attempt to constrain the parameter space ( albeit roughly )",
    "we have to rely on theoretical predictions and empirical evidence from the observed cv population , coupled with the limited information that can be extracted from the light curves .    following the procedure outlined in detail in @xcite ( d91 ) the radius of the accretion disc",
    "can be determined as a function of the binary separation , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for a given eclipse half - width at maximum intensity @xmath56 ( essentially timing the first and last contacts of eclipse and dividing by two ) .",
    "@xmath56 was determined by eye to be @xmath57 .",
    "the large error is due to the fact that the exact beginning and end of the eclipse are uncertain because of flickering .",
    "the left panel of fig.[fig : binparam ] shows the disc radius @xmath58 ( in units of the distance between the primary and the inner lagrangian point , @xmath59 ) calculated using equations 3 , 4 and 5 of d91 , for @xmath60 and various inclination angles .",
    "the curves are bound above by the requirement that @xmath61 and below by the requirement for a partial disc eclipse , satisfied if the disc radius is larger than the half - cord of the secondary ( shown by the change in line colour in the left panel of fig.[fig : binparam ] ) .",
    "this allows us to place a strict lower limit for the inclination angle to be @xmath62 .",
    "however , the upper limit of @xmath55 and the possible values of @xmath54 remain unconstrained .    using the mass function ,    @xmath63    we can transform a given @xmath64 pair to a unique @xmath65 pair .",
    "the right panel of figure[fig : binparam ] shows eq.[eq : mf ] calculated for @xmath62 and @xmath66 , over a wide range in secondary mass , @xmath67\\,\\le\\,0.6 $ ] .",
    "allowed @xmath65 pairs are located between the two dash - dot curves .",
    "we can further narrow down the parameter space , by making two assumptions :    1 .",
    "the secondary follows the mass - period relation of @xcite ; their equation8 ( power - law fit ) yields @xmath68 , while their equation9 ( linear fit ) yields @xmath69 ( fig.[fig : binparam ] , right panel , dashed horizontal lines ) . an average of these values is in perfect agreement with the value of @xmath70 predicted by the revised model track of @xcite for this orbital period .",
    "the radial velocity variation of the emission lines tracks the motion of the white dwarf , so @xmath71 and , therefore , @xmath72 ( fig.[fig : binparam ] , right panel , dotted lines ) .",
    "while the latter is a frequently adopted assumption in cv research , it has to be viewed with a certain amount of caution , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an encouraging fact in the case of  is that the phasing of the emission lines is consistent with the eclipse ephemeris .",
    "the constraint on @xmath54 imposes a narrower range of inclination angles @xmath73 ( fig.[fig : binparam ] , left panel , dashed vertical lines ) .",
    "if these assumptions are indeed correct , then the allowed @xmath65 pairs are indicated as the grey shaded area in the right panel of fig.[fig : binparam ] .",
    "in this paper , we identified hs2325 + 8205 as an eclipsing , frequently outbursting dwarf nova above the cv orbital period gap and presented our photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "we used these data to measure the orbital period and the radial velocity of the secondary star , as well as provide initial estimates on the binary parameters . with the photometric data at hand it remains unclear whether the white dwarf is fully eclipsed or not .",
    "the shallow eclipse depth could suggest that it is not eclipsed at all .",
    "high time resolution and signal - to - noise data at quiescence are needed in order to unambigously identify the eclipse geometry .",
    "the short outburst cycle of @xmath5 makes  a plausible zcam - type candidate .",
    "if confirmed , it will be only the third known eclipsing zcam system , after emcyg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and aypsc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    ", with its high declination ( circumpolar , ideal for observers in the northern hemisphere ) , short outburst recurrence period and magnitude range ( accessible with 2 - 4 m class telescopes ) offers an excellent target for systematic follow - up observations .",
    "simultaneous high - time resolution photometric and spectroscopic observations can provide unique insight in the changes in the structure of the accretion disc , through techniques such as eclipse mapping @xcite and doppler tomography @xcite .    furthermore , the outbursts of can be picked - up with relative ease by small aperture telescopes enabling the accumulation of a very long baseline of outburst data , which can then be compared to the predictions of the disc instability model .",
    "we strongly encourage observers from around the world to frequently monitor the system and put the zcam - type scenario to the test .",
