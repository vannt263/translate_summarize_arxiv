    "when the temperature of the medium formed after the collision is higher than a transition temperature , the effective potential between light quark and anti - quark weakens and deconfines the constituent quarks of mesons and baryons .",

    ", the effective color electric potential between @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be screened by the dense surrounding color charges .",
    "this color screening is similar to the debye screening observed in electromagnetic plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the temperature at which the heavy quark state becomes unbound due to this screening depends on the corresponding binding energy of the state . because of the large variation in radii between the different heavy quarkonia , they are expected to become unbound at different temperatures .",
    "there are many theoretical calculations which predict the temperature at which each quarkonium state is suppressed by color screening .",

    "other mechanisms of suppression include initial and final state cold nuclear matter effects , studied in @xmath19@xmath1au collisions by phenix  @xcite .",
    "there are also effects that can reduce the suppression . the dissociated charm ( and anti - charm )",
    "quark can undergo multiple scatterings and recombine with its former partner , once the medium cools down .",
    "in addition , the presence of about 6 - 20 open charm pairs in each central au@xmath1au collision at rhic , total cross section reported in  @xcite and 1000 binary collisions in very central au@xmath1au events . ] provides a good chance that the ground state charmonium was formed by coalescence of uncorrelated charm and anti - charm quarks present in the medium  @xcite .",
    "thus , even if all the initially produced @xmath18s are dissociated in the qgp medium , @xmath18s can be re - created at a later stage by the coalescence process .",
