    "entanglement is a property which is central to quantum mechanics and helps to distinguish it from classical mechanics .",
    "a vast amount of work has been undertaken on discrete variable entanglement , with somewhat less having been performed on the continuous variable case .",
    "it is the latter which interests us in this work , particularly as regards the entanglement of three optical modes .",
    "we will focus on an experimentally realised system which links two @xmath0 interactions in a combined downconversion and sum frequency generation process  @xcite , and examine its utility for the production of states which exhibit full tripartite entanglement . as far as we are aware ,",
    "full tripartite entanglement has only been unambiguously demonstrated by mixing squeezed vacua with linear optical elements  @xcite , although other methods which create the entanglement using an actual nonlinear interaction are under investigation , using both cascaded and concurrent @xmath0 processes  @xcite .",
    "the definition of tripartite entanglement for three - mode systems is a little more subtle than that for bipartite entanglement , with different classes of entanglement having been defined , depending on how the system density matrix may be partitioned  @xcite .",
    "the classifications range from fully inseparable , which means that the density matrix is not separable for any grouping of the modes , to fully separable , where the three modes are not entangled in any way . for the fully inseparable case , van loock and furusawa  @xcite , who call this genuine tripartite entanglement , have derived inequalities which are easily applicable to continuous variable processes .",
    "more recently , olsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have defined three - mode einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr )  @xcite type criteria , which also provide sufficient , but not necessary , conditions for the demonstration of genuine tripartite entanglement . in this article",
    "we will begin by reviewing the definitions of these entanglement criteria and then apply them to the outputs of the bondani scheme to quantify entanglement correlations which may in principle be measured experimentally .",
    "we begin by giving the optical quadrature definitions we will use in our analysis , as the exact form of the inequalities will depend on these . for three modes described by the bosonic annihilation operators @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , we define quadrature operators for each mode as @xmath3 so that the heisenberg uncertainty principle requires @xmath4 .",
    "the epr argument was introduced in 1935 in an attempt to show that quantum mechanics could not be both complete and consistent with local realism  @xcite .",
    "schrdinger replied that same year by introducing the concept of entangled states which were not compatible with classical notions such as local realism  @xcite . in 1989",
    "reid  @xcite , and reid and drummond  @xcite proposed a physical test of the epr paradox using optical quadrature amplitudes , which are mathematically identical to the position and momentum originally considered by epr .",
    "reid later expanded on this work , demonstrating that the satisfaction of the 1989 two - mode epr criterion always implies bipartite quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "tan made a similar demonstration in the context of teleportation , considering the outputs from a nondegenerate optical parameteric amplifier ( opa ) mixed on a beamsplitter  @xcite . in this article",
    "we use an extension of reid s original approach to the case of tripartite correlations , where quadratures of three different optical modes are involved .",
    "this extension was developed and formally proven to demonstrate the presence of tripartite entanglement by olsen , bradley and reid in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that we shall call these the obr criteria .",
    "there are two ways to consider the experimentally accessible form of the obr criteria , depending on whether we use information from two quadratures to infer properties of the other , or information from one to infer combined properties of the other two . in the first case",
    "we make a linear estimate of the quadrature @xmath5 from the properties of the combined mode @xmath6 , using parameters which can be optimised , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . it has been shown  @xcite that minimising the root mean square error in this estimate leads to an optimal inferred variance , @xmath7^{2}}{v(\\hat{x}_{j}\\pm \\hat{x}_{k})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 .",
    "we follow the same procedure for the @xmath9 quadratures to give expressions which may be obtained by swapping each @xmath10 for a @xmath9 in the above to give the optimal inferred estimate @xmath11^{2}}{v(\\hat{y}_{j}\\pm \\hat{y}_{k})}. \\label{eq : epr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a demonstration of the epr paradox can be claimed whenever theory predicts @xmath12 as was proven  @xcite , this demonstration for the @xmath13 possible values of @xmath14 is then sufficient to establish tripartite entanglement , without any assumptions having been made about whether the states involved are gaussian or not .",
    "following the same logic , if we use the properties of mode @xmath14 to infer properties of the combined mode @xmath6 , we find that there is a demonstration of the other three mode form of the epr paradox whenever @xmath15 where , for example , @xmath16^{2}}{v(\\hat{x}_{i})}.\\ ] ] as above , this demonstration for the @xmath13 possible combinations also serves to establish complete inseparability of the density matrix .      a set of conditions which are sufficient to demonstrate tripartite entanglement for any quantum state have been derived by van loock and furusawa  @xcite .",
    "using our quadrature definitions , the van loock - furusawa conditions give a set of inequalities , which we shall refer to as the vlf inequalities , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and the @xmath19 are arbitrary real numbers .",
    "as shown in reference  @xcite , the violation of the first inequality still leaves the possibility that mode @xmath13 could be separated from modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but this possibility is negated by violation of the second .",
    "therefore , if any two of these inequalities are violated , the system is fully inseparable and genuine tripartite entanglement is guaranteed .",
    "we note also that genuine tripartite entanglement may still be possible when none of these inequalities is violated .",
    "we will now investigate optimisation of the vlf criteria , using the freedom allowed in the choice of the @xmath19 , which are arbitrary real parameters .",
    "a simple minimisation of the right - hand sides of eq .",

    "@xcite uses an undepleted pumps approximation and we will begin with a more complete form which quantises all the interacting fields .",
    "the hamiltonian describes the coupling of five modes of the electromagnetic field in a phase - matched simultaneous sum frequency generation and downversion process in a manner analogous to the schemes considered by olsen and bradley  @xcite , and has previously been investigated by ferraro _ et al . _",

    "this hamiltonian approximately describes a downconversion process cascaded with a sum - frequency generation process where one of the downconverted modes becomes an auxiliary pump mode for the frequency generation process .",
    "it gives a simplified description because it does not include effects such as dispersion within the nonlinear medium , for example .",
